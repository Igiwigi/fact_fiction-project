CORALLIAN ROCKS OF OXFORD, ETC. 155

Dr. Mortry Davies in his correlation table [25] of four years later brings the base of
the Kimeridge down to the top of the Martelli Zone, and extends the Oxfordien, sensu
Gallico, a zone lower than SaLFexD, just below the top of the Oxford Clay of the Oxford
district. This makes an overlap of one zone with the Oxfordian, sensu Anglico, which is
equivalent to the upper part of the Continental Callovian. The confusion and ambiguity
arising from this dual terminology are only too apparent. To make use of the term
Oxfordian at all is to court unintelligibility.

Tn view of these facts we seem thoroughly justified in retaining the word Corallian
for the rocks which have for so long been known by that name. Apart from the fact
that it has become so familiar that the geologist who makes use of it is at least sure of
being immediately understood, it is even admitted by the leading Continental strati-
graphers that some such name is indispensable whereby to designate the shallow-water
episode between the Oxford and Kimeridge Clays. Thus Have, whose universal review
of the Jurassic system may claim to be the widest extant, although rejecting Corallian
because it does not conform strictly to the laws of nomenclature, adopts the alternative
name Lusitanien* [13, p. 1045]. The Lusitanien, in its restricted zonal sense, however,
assigns to the Oxford and Kimeridge Clays in England shallow-water deposits, which
must logically be classed with the intervening series. From every point of view, therefore,
we seem justified in retaining the convenient term Corallian for the whole of the shallow-
water episode in this country.
