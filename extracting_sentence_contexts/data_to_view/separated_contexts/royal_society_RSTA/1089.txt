154 T. M. LOWRY AND H. HUDSON ON OPTICAL ROTATORY POWER. Summary.

(a) Measurements have been made of the absorption, circular dichroism and rotatory

dispersion of a series of 9 bornyl and menthy] xanthates and related compounds, which

had been prepared and partially investigated by TsCHUGAEFF.

(b) The seven xanthates show two absorption bands, the weaker band at longer
wave-lengths being attributed to the —CS—S group and the stronger band at shorter
wave-lengths to the >CS group. These bands cannot be represented by the equations
of Kerrener and Hetmuonrz, BreLEecKi and Henri, or Kun and Braun, but
conform closely to a new equation which has been developed to express the fact that the
absorptions are symmetrical on a scale of wave-lengths. (c) The circular dichroism in the first absorption band follows a similar course to the
absorption, the “ dissymmetry factor,” (c, ~ ¢,)/e, being approximately proportional to
the frequency. Since, however, the circular dichroism of the second band is of
opposite sign, this proportionality disappears where the two bands begin to overlap.
