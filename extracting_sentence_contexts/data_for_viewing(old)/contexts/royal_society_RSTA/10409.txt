be hung with its plane north and south, then about 12 o'clock in the day there
would be no couple tending to turn it, because the sther drift due to the earth’s
motion in its orbit round the sun is at right angles to the plane of the condenser;
on the other hand, at any other hour, say 3 o'clock, there would be a couple making
itself felt by a tendency to rotate the plane of the condenser into the position
at right angles to the drift.

The effect to be looked for was an extremely small one, being a second-order effect
only. In the earlier forms of the apparatus the calculated deflection was found to —
be entirely obscured by a number of accidental disturbing causes, and, in fact, the —
course of the experiments consisted mainly in eliminating these disturbances one
by one.

The first difficulty arose from the preponderance of the electrostatic attractions
between the suspended condenser and the walls of the containing case. To minimise
these effects the condenser was protected by a metallic coating which was kept at
the same potential as the case, all being earthed.

The suspending wire was made the insulated terminal, so that any electrostatic
pull upon this wire could only produce a force acting through the centre of support,
and thus the rotational effect would be eliminated, leaving only a translatory pull,
which would not affect the result. There were still residual electrostatic actions,
