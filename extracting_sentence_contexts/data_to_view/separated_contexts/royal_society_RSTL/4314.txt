In this specimen, from which the lower laminz have been accidentally detached, as
is usnally the case, the tubercles are deyeloped into the form of regular pointed
dermal teeth, each having a pulp-cavity, fig. 28 a, from which spring small branching
tubes, 28 b, like those seen in the dermal teeth of ordinary Placoids, Each one ex-
hibits a laminated structure like that seen in the true teeth of reptiles, the lamellae
being arranged as a snccession of cones, having evidently been formed by the addi-
tion of new internal layers organized around the soft pulp. In fact, it is only one
of the laminated tubercles of the operculum, fig. 26 a, drawn out vertically ; the len-
ticular space, fig. 26 c, being also elongated in the form of a true pulp-cavity, whilst,
in consequence of this modification of the external contour, the Jamella have assumed
the appearance of a 8vecession of cones inclosing each other.
