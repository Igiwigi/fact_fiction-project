As Kiihn observes, however, the ‘stalk’ ‘ist doch
nie so scharf vom Schuppenkérper abgesetzt und quer abgestuzt wie ein normaler Schuppen-
stiel’. This type he contrasts with a third (which occurs with increasing frequency as heat
stimulation is postponed to a later stage in development) in which a scale-like process
emerges from the scale in normal orientation, that is, attached to the parent scale by its
narrow end,

I am inclined to regard these types not as indicating reversal in polarity, but as types of
disturbance of the ratio ob vole a
rate of area increase
1945). The fact that, in scales, flattening always follows dilatation of an originally cylindrical
rudiment to a club, suggests that the sudden change in shape of the cross-section of the
scale is due to the fact that the rudiment with a circular cross-section becomes mechanically
unstable when its diameter exceeds a certain limiting value. It is possible that the scale
collapses like a thin-walled cone in which, at the base, the ratio of diameter to wall
thickness has exceeded a limiting value determined by the stiffness of the material. The
collapse of the scale, however, can scarcely be under its own weight.
