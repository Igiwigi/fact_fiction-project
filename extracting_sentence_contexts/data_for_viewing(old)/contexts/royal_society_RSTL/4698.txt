Seems necessary that some preliminary remarks should be made on the nature of the
solidification of the globe. It seems the more necessary that these remarks should
be now given, as they will not probably be found to agree entirely with those-which
have been made on the same subject by an eminent geologist and geometer*. It
is, however, satisfactory to reflect that even if my views respecting the solidification
of the earth should be more correct than those of Mr. Hopkins, the real yalue of that
gentleman's researches will still remain unaltered.

Although until now no allusion has been made to the probable cause of the pri-
mitive fluidity of the earth, it becomes necessary in order to proceed with the geolo-
gical portion of these investigations that this cause should be assigned. Intense
heat is that which is generally supposed to be the cause, and which the advocates of
the earth's central heat seem to sapport by numerous facts. The solidification of this
heated mass of fluid is 80 connected with its refrigeration, that some remarks on the
latter subject must accompany or precede any investigations about the former.

If the whole earth from the action of a high temperature were reduced to that
state of fluidity which forms the groundwork of the hypothesis upon which the theory
of its figure is founded, it appears probable that the fluid mass would be extremely
heterogeneous chemically, as well as mechanically. New chemical combinations
would be formed, of whose physical properties it would be difficult to form an accu-
rate idea. After the most energetic combining tendencies of the different substances
composing the fluid would have been satisfied, the mass may be supposed to have
arrived at a state of comparative chemical stability. Such properties of the different
compounds as density and compressibility, would then exert a direct influence upon
