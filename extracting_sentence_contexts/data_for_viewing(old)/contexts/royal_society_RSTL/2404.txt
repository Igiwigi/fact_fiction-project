this subject, I found it requisite to study the process of dying, to determine the steps
by which the body of the more perfect animal becomes subject to the laws of inani-
mate matter.

The experiments by which this was more immediately attempted were not laid be-
fore the Society as were the other parts of the investigation. They are detailed at
length in the second part of my Inquiry into the Laws of the Vital Functions. I have
there, however, entered no further into the nature of death than was necessary for the
purpose I then had in view. I am now about to compare the results of these experi-
ments with those of others, made since the publication of that treatise, with a view,
as far as experiment, can apply to it, of explaining the nature of death.

It appears to me that the various facts ascertained in the course of the inquiries in
which I have been 80 long engaged, throw light on this subject. I shall, as I proceed,
refer to the passages, either in my papers in the Philosophical 'Transactions or my
Inquiry into the Laws of the Vital Functions, where the proofs of the different posi-
tions I shall have occasion to state, will be found.

In the last of the papers above referred to, I had occasion to observe, that there is
no question relating to the animal economy which involves a more general view of its
phenomena than the nature of sleep. The nature of death also includes a general
view of the functions of health, for such we shall find are the laws of our frame, that
these functions alone necessarily lead to death ; but the nature of death is a more
complicated question. It includes the various ways in which the functions are influ-
enced by disease, the effects of which are 80 numerous that they seem at first view a
