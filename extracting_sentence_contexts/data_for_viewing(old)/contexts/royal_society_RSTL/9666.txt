gpectrum. The wave-lengths of the FRAUNHOFER lines in the infra-red region were
taken from the map furnished by one of us with the paper already referred to. A
test of the accuracy of the measurements was the fact that the same wave-lengths
of the absorption of any particular substance could always be obtained on several

photographs. we

furnishes almost entirely a line spectrum and, in fact, our meagurements were referred
to an empiric scale derived from the absorptions of this body, before we were
fortunate enough to obtain a wave-length scale from strict comparison with the golar
spectrum. We believe that the chloroform spectrum might be almost better to give
a fiducial scale. The multiplicity of fine lines in both of these 8ubstances makes the
mapping the spectra comparatively easy when once the position of those lines has
been accurately fixed.

Source of light.â€”In the positive pole of the electric light we have a 8ource of light
which may be considered of uniform brightness, if the light emitted from the crater
only be employed. Whether the. crater be 4 or 4 inch in diameter (the one being
produced by a small magneto-electric machine, and the latter by a larger one) the
brightness remains constant, being apparently that due to the temperature at which
