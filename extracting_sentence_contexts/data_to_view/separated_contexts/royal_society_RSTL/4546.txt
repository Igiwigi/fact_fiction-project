The weight of his authority
bas not been without influence, for it cannot be denied that Bzrzeirvs's view has
become more and more generally accepted, especially since a series of comparative
researches, conducted of late upon the derivatives of the salts of ammonia and of
organic bases, appeared to give fresh support to this theory. These experiments
pointed out that the elimination of hydrogen from organic bases and ammonia is by
no means confined to one equivalent; oxalate of ammonia, which by the loss of 2 equiys.

the form of water, becomes cyanogen (oxalonitrile); an analogous change occurs with
the acid salts of ammonia, resulting in the formation of two classes of compounds,
differing, the one by two, the other by four equivalents of water, from the original
salt.

'The representation of several of these groups in analogous derivatives from the
salts of organic bases, especially from the salts of aniline, could not but strengthen
the belief that ammonia actnally pre-exists in the organic alkaloids. Incidentally to
8ome researches communicated to the Chemical Society of LondonÂ®*, I gave a synopsis
of all the facts supporting the view of BerzerLws. The prosecution however of this inquiry has elicited many points, which are scarcely
reconcileable with this theory. In another paper I endeavoured to show that the
force of the argument in favour of this view, derived from the considerations just
stated, is greatly neutralized on the completion of the comparison between the two
series by the failure of the analogy, just at the point where its occurrence would have
been most decisive.
