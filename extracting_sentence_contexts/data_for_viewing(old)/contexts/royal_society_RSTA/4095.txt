Here, Ay is the minimal area of the monolayer at close contact between the particles; we have
used the expressions Ay = 2V3R5N, which presumes hexagonal packing, and A = Na, where a is
the mean area per particle in a monolayer that contains N particles.

Equation (3.4) yields IH, « AS? x L, By contrast, the experiment indicates that
asymptotically I. = IT — Ip «AS? x L3 (e.g. figure 2b,d; equation (2.1); [23]). This difference
could be due to the fact that the assumption for pairwise additivity of the interparticle force
(superposition approximation for particles at an interface) is not adequate in the case of the long-
range dipole-dipole interaction [32]. In other words, the longer range of the experimental surface
pressure, IT.) L~3, can be due to collective effects (multi-particle interactions), as demonstrated
in the next subsection.

(c) Model of surface pressure taking into account multi-particle interactions

A different approach was developed in [23] to take into account multi-particle interactions. The
monolayer of charged particles was modelled as a periodic lattice of surface charges (figure 4b).
The electric field created by this lattice in the non-polar fluid was determined by solving the
Poisson equation, along with the respective boundary condition,
