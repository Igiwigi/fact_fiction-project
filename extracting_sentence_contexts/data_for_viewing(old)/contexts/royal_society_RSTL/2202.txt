ever, limited my investigation to those simple and unyarying laws to which nature
always adheres; and therefore the following observations must be considered as re-
stricted only to certain general principles, subject to a variety of modifications.

The principles which I propose to illustrate will (under similar circumstances) at
all times exhibit the same phenomena, but for the sake of perspicuity I shall now
only refer to the coasts of Kent and Sussex.

SECTION 1.

That the pebbles which compose the shingle beaches on these coasts are kept in
continual motion by the action of the sea, and that their ultimate progress is in an
easterly direction, are facts long known and commonly observed. The following

observations are chiefly directed to the particular manner in which the motions are
produced.

From a general view of the effects that I have noticed, it appears that the actions
of the sea upon the loose pebbles are of three kinds: the first heaps up, or accumn-
lates the pebbles against the shore ; the second disturbs, or breaks down the accumu-
