Tn making the above suggestions on the possible action of the series of retia that occur
in Lamna, I do so naturally with very great hesitation, owing to the inadequacy and
purely anatomical character of the facts upon which they are based. It seems, however,
fairly clear that their main object is, as suggested by Carazzi and others, to provide
a stabilising head of blood, to ensure that a given part should constantly receive the
optimum supply. In view of the poor arterial propulsion and low pressure in the
arteries of fishes it does not seem likely that they are needed or used to neutralise the
shock of sudden increases in pressure, as has generally been assuthed ; in fact the
opposite is more likely the case, to guard against temporary diminution of the supply
and consequent local anzemia. Tn carrying out the above work I have received much kindly encouragement from my
chief, Sir ARTHUR Kerra, for which I wish to thank him cordially. I am also much
indebted to Mr. S. Srewarp for preparing the photographs reproduced in the Plates
and to Mr. Trrzi for help in translating various Italian papers for me.
