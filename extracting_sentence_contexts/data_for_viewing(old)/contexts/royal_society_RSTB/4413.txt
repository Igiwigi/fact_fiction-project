If the reader will now apply Sir Ray LanxKesrerâ€™s description of a rostro-carinate
flint implement to the specimens illustrated (Plate 51, figs. 1-4; Plate 52, figs. 1-4;
Plate 53, figs. 1-4; Plate 54, figs. 1-4; Plate 55, figs. 1-4), it will be realised that
these implements, though of palwolithic river-drift age, are of the rostro-carinate type,
but they are better made and more highly evolved than those found below the Red
Crag and in other pre-river-valley deposits. The two other specimens illustrated
(Plate 56, figs. 1-4) and (Plate 57, figs. 1-4), though exhibiting the beak-like profile,
cannot be regarded as true rostro-carinates owing to the fact that they do not possess
the more or less flat ventral plane. Four views of each of the seven implements are *
given and their various characteristics are indicated clearly (Ant. = Anterior and
Post. = Posterior). A sectional drawing of each specimen is also provided.

An Explanation of the Peculiar Form of the Seven Specimens.

In giving an explanation of the peculiar form of the seven specimens under
examination, it is necessary, first of all, to deal with the question of flint flaking, To
