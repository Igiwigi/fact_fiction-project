and the average casual error of all the readings, good and bad alike, is + 0-006°/mm.,
the error at wave-length 2410-526 A.U. increases abruptly to + 0-014°/mm. The
corresponding rotations, however, were completely concordant in three series of exposures
at 428x + 2°, 3°, 4° = 77043 + 1°, and these concordant rotations would have to be
increased by about 6° in order to give the calculated value for the rotation in degrees per
millimetre. In such a case as this it is much easier to imagine that the polarimetric
readings included a satellite which increased the effective wave-length of the light by
0-07 A.U. than to postulate an error of this magnitude in the recorded wave-length of the
main line, or of 6° in rotations which differed only by + 1°. This explanation probably
applies to a large number of other cases in which concordant errors are recorded in two
series of readings, and it is even possible that some of the discordant readings may have
been due to the fact that in one series a satellite was included in the readings, whilst in
the other series it was possible to read the main line without the satellite.

(f) Sub-Division of the Table-—The number and accuracy of the readings, as well as of
the available wave-lengths, vary greatly in different parts of the table. The table has,
therefore, been broken up into a series of sections, and notes dealing with the special
features of each section are set out below.

(i) First Section.—2327-49 to 2368-60 A.U.

In this region of the spectrum the rotations were very large, but the lines are so widely
separated that they could be read with an accuracy that was not surpassed by any of the
other photographic readings. The probable error of the readings was, indeed, of the
