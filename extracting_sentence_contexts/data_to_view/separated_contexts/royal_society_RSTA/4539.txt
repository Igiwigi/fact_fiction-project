Therefore, the wave generation and early wave evolution must be part

of the model framework that considers hypervelocity impacts and cratering processes. Only a : =
relatively small number of codes exist that are capable of dealing with hypervelocity impact : Sy
processes and only a very few of them have been used to study meteorite impact processes. : 2
For a summary of so-called hydrocode modelling, see, for example, [43] and references therein. : &
Although hydocodes are able to simulate generation, propagation and inundation of impact- 22
induced tsunami waves, this approach would be computationally too expensive to cover the ne]
whole sequence of processes. In fact, only a few examples of hydrocode modelling are published : ie
where the propagation of waves was tracked as far as 100 times the diameter of the projectile : =
(e.g. [37-40]). For the most likely scenario of a relatively small object of a few hundred metres in [8

diameter wave propagation can be simulated only to a distance of tens of kilometres with such
an all-in-one model approach. The multi-scale nature of impact-induced tsunami waves suggests the usage of different
models appropriate to deal with the specific processes on different spatio-temporal scales, such as
generation, propagation including shoaling and run-up, separately.
