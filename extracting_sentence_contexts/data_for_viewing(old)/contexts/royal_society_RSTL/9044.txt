Hence putting 0=7 and doubling, we have the whole length of the epicycloid from

cusp to cusp=twice the sum of the diameters of the generating circles of the curve and
its inyolute.

Seco 11.—The Hypocyeloid.

108. Having discussed at considerable length the properties of the epicycloid, we
shall treat very briefly those of the hypocycloid. In fact, analytically, the latter curve
differs from the former only in the sign of a parameter; hence the properties of one
curye are with slight modifications true of the other. The most interesting are those
which are found by considering the curves in combination.

109. In the equation «=3_,0 of art. 96 let 6
denote the angle which LP makes externally
with the tangent to the director circle (which
