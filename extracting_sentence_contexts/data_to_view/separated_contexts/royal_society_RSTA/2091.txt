According to (A 5) in appendix A, these
partial entropies result in

S1(g') =—kpTr(@comIng') and $2(g”) = —kgTr(@com Ing”). (6.9)

A comparison of (5.9) with (5.7) depicts that the partial entropies are not additive with respect to
the entropy of the compound system

$1 +8)-S= —kpTr{ecom( In(o!e”) - Ingcom) }, (5.10)

because the density operator of the compound system does not decompose in general. Using Klein’s inequality [20]

Tr(A In B) — Tr(A In A) < TrB — TrA, (5.11)
we obtain according to (5.11) and (5.5)
Te Qcom(In(g"e*) — In gcom) | = TH(o"Q) — Tr@com = 0 (6.12)
and
Tr(e'o*) =Tr'Tr’°(e!e*) = 1, (5.13)
and (5.10) results in
S$, +S2>S. (5.14)

If the entropy of the compound system does not decompose into the partial entropies of the
decomposed system, it is according to (5.14) smaller than the sum of the partial entropies. The

!Thermodynamical quantities of the bipartite system are written in bold font.


descriptions of a system as a compound one or as a decomposed one are different, a fact which is
denoted as compound deficiency [8].

(b) Equations of motion

Using the calculation rules of appendix A and the decomposition of the Hamiltonian (4.1), the
modified von Neumann equation (4.11)

. i °
Boom =— 5 [OH +H? +74"), Qcom + Gcom (6.15)

results in two equations of motion for the traced density operators of the subsystems by taking
(A 8) into account

. . i i °
0) :=TrQcom =— am [x, 2com| - a(n, @com| + Tr Qcom

= —iH,2| - ‘nln, @com | + eo! (5.16)

and

. . i i °
0? :=Tr com = — am [x?, 2com| - ar [x2, @com| +Tr! com

= re, 7] - in [x2, @com | + 02, (5.17)

As (5.16) and (5.17) depict, the traced operators fa 1 and fa 2 include as expected the interaction
Hamiltonian H” and beyond that, also the density operator @com (4.5); of the compound system. That means, traced operators, although acting on the sub-space of a subsystem include quantities
belonging to the bipartite compound system on the whole. The density operators 9! and o* and

the propagators 2! and @2 of the subsystems #1 and #2 result from uninvertible tracing according
to (5.1)-(5.4):

com> (01,07) +> @com and com> (21,07) 4+ com (5.18)

That means, the knowledge of a! and oe does not replace @com.
