We performed a series
of experiments on rats to determine the lethality of heated Echis venom and found
that the minimum lethal dose by subcutaneous injection of venom which had been
kept in solution at a temperature of 78 to 80° C. for 30 minutes was 0°008 grm. per
kilogramme—that is to say, the heated venom possessed only one-tenth the lethality
of the unheated venom. It might be inferred that one-tenth of the toxic power of
the venom was due to neurotoxin, but against this assumption is the fact that the rat
which died of the heated venom showed hemorrhages, both local and remote. It is
more probable, therefore, that heating to this extent does not completely destroy the
heemotoxins of the venom. (b) Nerves.
