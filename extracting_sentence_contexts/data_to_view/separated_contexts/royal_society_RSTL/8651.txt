In addition to the instance of india-rubber tires already
mentioned, there are several other phenomena connected with wheels which point to
such a law, and can be explained by the recognition of the slipping under the roller. Steel and Tron Rails.

.The very great advantage in point of durability of steel rails over iron has been a
matter of much surprise, it not being sufficiently accounted for by the greater hardness
of the steel, supposing it to be subjected to the same wearing action as the iron. This
is at once explained, however, by the recognition of the fact that hardness tends to
reduce the slipping and hence the wearing action, as well as to enable the rail the
better to withstand the wear to which it is subjected. That rails should wear at all in places where they are straight and where brakes are
not applied is-a matter which calls for an explanation, and this, s0 far as I am aware,
has not hitherto been given ; mere crushing, however much it might deform the rail,
would not cause such a reduction of weight as actually takes place. The explanation
of this phenomenon also at once follows the recognition of the slipping which attends
rolling.
