known conditions of carbon dioxide partial pressure. From these figures a change from
aragonite to calcite in contact with water can be anticipated. From these figures also it
may be deduced that the calcite form is the more likely to be precipitated when reactions
are carried out under conditions which approach those demanded by classical phase-rule
considerations.

Vaterite is said to be less stable than calcite or aragonite, although it remains unchanged
for long periods when dry; it slowly changes into the calcite modification when in the moist
condition, especially on heating (Lucas 1947).

Mackenzie’s figure given for the solubility of calctum carbonate hexahydrate in boiled
water near 2° C is between 0-03 and 0-04 g./l., ie. much above those for calcite and
aragonite. This will account in part for the fact that the hexahydrate is much less frequently
formed than anhydrous calcium carbonate under normal conditions of precipitation, but
Mackenzie (1923) believed that it could only be formed under special conditions which
‘allow of the dissolution of calctum carbonate in excess of carbonic acid and the subsequent
breaking up of the bicarbonate thus produced’. The hexahydrate has been reported to be
unstable in contact with water at all temperatures above 0° C (Hume & Topley 1926),
though in some solutions it can undoubtedly persist, presumably in metastable condition,
at much higher temperatures, certainly up to 20° C, and it can be formed at temperatures
even above this (Dorfmiiller 1938). The decomposition rate of dry crystals is much influenced
by impurities and by the extent to which decomposition has proceeded; and once started
decomposition cannot be stopped (Mackenzie 1923).
