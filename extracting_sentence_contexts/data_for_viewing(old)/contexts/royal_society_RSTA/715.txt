(a) Distribution of dipoles

Solving the linear algebra problem for the dipoles in a finite-sized array reveals the dipole
distributions in the array. Figure 3 demonstrates this by showing the dipole magnitudes and
phases for each nanoparticle. Figure 3 shows the results only for the y-component of the dipoles
because they strongly dominate in the presence of a y-polarized incident field. Results were
computed just below and just above the I-point. We can observe that, below the I-point, the
magnitude of the induced dipoles tends to be higher than above the Iâ€™-point. Also, while there
is some spatial dependence, this dependence is quite weak. In contrast, just above the -point
strong modulations appear along the y-direction as diffraction starts to play a stronger role.

Figure 3 was computed with full dipole fields, but with the parameters used it turns out that
including only the 1/r terms of the field is enough to induce the observed modulations. In fact, for
the modulation along y, only the long-range y-component of the dipole fields of the nanoparticles
is required. This is not too surprising, because the lattice period is quite large compared with the
assumed nanoparticle size.

(b) Observables

Experimentally, one will not measure the dipoles, but rather quantities derived from them. Then
the question arises: how is the underlying spatial inhomogeneity of the dipoles reflected in the
actually observed quantities? As a first example, in figure 4, we compute the extinction efficiency
throughout the array. A total extinction efficiency would be a sum over the contributions from
