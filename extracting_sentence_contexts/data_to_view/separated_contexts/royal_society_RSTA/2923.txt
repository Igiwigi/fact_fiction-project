This way we established that for consistent ICs of localization, where the only assumption is a | 2 |
qualitative one, namely that there is localization and that there is consistency in the procedure, and
using only orders-of-magnitude considerations, we derived a quantitative result, as follows: “3

(to be more precise, using weak restrictions we obtained the above result, which is strong, as will :s
be shown next). :

Next we present an expression for the Hamiltonian under the assumption that the first mass
does not impact, and the frequencies are such that the dynamics of the slow flow lies on the RM,
taking (with no loss of generality) the initial angle difference of # =0:

where one identifies the first term in the braces in equation (5.5) as (Ge. DN
Now, the conceptual difference between the averaged Hamiltonians in equations (5.4) and (5.5) a

is that in terms of the function 6 (t), the first corresponds to the limit of localization, and the second aes]

to the limit of delocalization. Thus the two constitute the two limit cases and given also the fact ,

that the first is an infimum, one can argue that the true Hamiltonian for localization conditions

should be bounded by the two expressions. In terms of form, the only difference between the two

Hamiltonians is in the prefactor of ,f1. We will denote this prefactor (without the minus) by €.
