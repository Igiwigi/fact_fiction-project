This choice was made principally on account of the
large size of both the cells and fibres and the clearness of the connection between the
giant cell and its giant fibre. Moreover, each giant fibre of Halla is connected with
only one giant cell, whereas in Arenicola, the earthworms, and many other Annelids,
each giant fibre is composed of the conjoined processes of several or many giant cells ;
further, there are none of those complex anastomoses between the various giant
fibres of Halla such as are present in Arenicola and some other Polychzetes, and in
many Oligocheetes. Consequently the relations of the giant fibres are less complex
in Halla than in most other Annelids in which such fibres are present, a fact which,
taken along with the large size of the giant nerve elements in this worm, indicates
that Halla is the most favourable starting point for the study ot these striking but
refractory structures. The results have been confirmed by an examination of the
corresponding structures in Aglawrides fulgida* in which the neurofibrille are
especially well seen. 2. HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE GIANT NERVE CELLS AND GIANT
NERVE FIBRES OF ANNELIDS,

The first record of the occurrence of a giant fibre in Annelids is in ChaparipeE's
description (1861, pp.
