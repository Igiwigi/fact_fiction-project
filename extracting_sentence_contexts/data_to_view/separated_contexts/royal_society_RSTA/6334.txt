this study, the training of the pavement texture recognition model was performed with a limited
dataset of only five images per category. This constraint was motivated by the fact that collecting
diverse and extensive samples of pavement texture images is a challenging and laborious process
in road detection work. The main objective of this study was to propose a reliable model capable
of achieving high accuracy in recognizing pavement textures despite the limited availability of
training data, ultimately contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of road surface
analysis and maintenance. The number of images used for model training is presented in table 2.
