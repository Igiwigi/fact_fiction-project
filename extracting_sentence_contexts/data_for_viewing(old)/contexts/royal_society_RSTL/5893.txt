phySiological point of view ; it will, however, increase their power in proportion as the

'Sarea of their insertions is extended. Moreover, these muscles are largely deyeloped as
Ewell as the ventral pair. It would therefore seem probable that the movements of the
Ehell upon the peduncle, in these species, may be more extensive and livelier than usual.
ZBut to the palzontologist, to whom the muscular impressions in fossils are of great
= value, these modifications cannot fail to possess considerable interest, evincing as they
-Sdo to what extent the arrangement of the muscles may be modified without any essen-
= tial change in the economy of the animal. In the dorsal valve there may be, as in the

above examples, as many as six muscular impressions instead of four, and in the ventral
bo may be two less than usnal; facts sufficiently puzzling without the light of anato-

mical investigation. Tt is also worthy of remark, that in those species with the dorsal
adjustor muscles attached to the valve there is no hinge-plate*; and therefore it may be
 Presumed that in the fossil species with this plate deficient the muscles will be arranged
in the same manner.

In Rhynchonella pittacea* the general disposition of the museles is the same as in
W. australis, only they are longer and more slender, particularly the occlusors, which,
with the exception of their extremities, are thin and tendinons. The surfaces of attach-
ment also vary a little in form, as can be readily seen on removing the shell. The extre-
mities of the muscles are then observed, as usual, at the ventral surface of the animal,
clustered together, a little in advance of the umbonal region. The occlusors are almost
