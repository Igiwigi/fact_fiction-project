‘lamella (figs. 31A and B, p. 236). Judging by the illustrations, the three species
of Donax described by Rice are all homorhabdie.

Cyrena floridana, again, has flat, homorhabdic lamelle, but Cyrena sinuosa
plicate, heterorhabdic lamelle. Crassatella cumingi and Crastella indica have simple
homorhabdie, flat lamellze, and interlamellar junctions of the form of isolated bars,
whereas Crassatella floridana has plicate, heterorhabdic gills with interlamellar septa.
Rocellaria dubia has flat lamelle and interlamellar septa not regularly arranged,
while Rocellaria gigantea has plicate lamelle with interlamellar septa at regular
intervals. Both are homorhabdie.

The differentiation of principal filaments may possibly be connected in some obscure
way with the fact that these alone contain the afferent branchial blood channels, the
arterialised blood finding its way back to the auricle from the ordinary filaments.
This direction of the blood stream is a matter upon which Bonnet,f Sturrer and
Haren-Norman are agreed; but I am not in a position to express an opinion upon
it since, the whole of the material available being preserved in alcohol, I have not
injected any specimens. M4&ntaaux, it should be noted, regards the blood as passing
down one principal filament and back by the next, the principal filaments of each
lamella being thus alternately afferent and efferent (62, p. 175. Solen and some
other forms), and Jonnstone (40, fig. 26) in his investigations of Cardiuwm has
arrived at the same conclusion.

What it is important to note in this connection is the fact that principal filaments’
are ontogenetically a secondary differentiation. No genus could be better adapted
