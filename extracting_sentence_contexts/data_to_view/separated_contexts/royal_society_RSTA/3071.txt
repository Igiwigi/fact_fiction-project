(Cf. Section IV., § 8, p. 63.) The fact that the loss of magnetism is very gradual in nickel-iron alloys instead of
being very sudden as in nearly pure iron is clearly in accord with the theory of the
process by which the alloys lose their magnetism. In iron the temperature at which
the permeability becomes practically indistinguishable from that of the air is only a
few degrees above that at which dy/dé first becomes negative. In each of the alloys
there were about 130° C. between the aa temperatures.
