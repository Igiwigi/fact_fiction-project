384 MR. W. D. NIVEN ON CERTAIN DEFINITE INTEGRALS

It is obvious the same method of solution as the foregoing will apply generally
towards determining
=

where f(z) is any function whose differential coefficients are finite at the origin, In
fact, we find

, mn! [dq* R? an" Rt a+
[OP A8=r(BY 4% rms tmramrgs +0 (W)

where, after the differentiations are performed, 2 is to be put equal to zero.

A result practically equivalent to the above is given by Heixs (© Kugelfunctionen,”
8econd edition, p. 76), and applied to various cases where the functions can be ex-
panded in simple series of zonal harmonics. The functions are

(1+kp9)-**?, (1—p2), 5m"? p, (1p)
