nating platinum by heat.

I attempted to explode five grains of the powderin a strong
green glass tube, two feet in length, and two-thirds of an
inch in diameter of bore. I succeeded in exploding a suffi-
cient quantity of the powder to furnish a half cubic inch of
gas; but in cooling, the tube cracked and the mercury fell.
I immediately examined the tube. The space occupied by
the gas was lined with a thin coat of moisture. The odour
of ammonia was very perceptible in the tube, and turmeric
paper was changed to brown by the moisture in it.

The fact of the disengagement of ammoniacal gas on
exploding the powder, seems also to be proved by a very
simple experiment I made. I put a little of the powder in the
centre of a tube about eighteen inches in length. I opened

a bottle of strong muriatic acid, and placed it at the open end
of the tube. I then exploded the powder -by the heat of the
Spirit lamp; at the instant of the explosion, a quantity of dense
white vapour, like muriate of ammonia, made its appearance.
