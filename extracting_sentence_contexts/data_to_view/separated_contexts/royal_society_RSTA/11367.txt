It has been
shown by Basser how the whole scheme may be formulated from a single energy
function by the principle of Least Action.

3. In the present paper it is proposed to take the fundamental equations of this
type of theory in a general form on the lines of Mr. Larmor’s recent papers on
Electrodynamics, and to develop them so as to obtain the solutions of the problems
of the reflection of light at the surface of a magnet, and of the transmission of light
through normally magnetised metallic films. ‘The formule so obtained will be
compared with the available experimental results, with a view to ascertaining to
what extent the theory is in agreement with the facts. The theory involves a single
magneto-optic constant which in metals may be assumed complex; we shall try
whether it is possible, by giving suitable numerical values to the modulus and vector
angle of this constant, to make the theory account for all the observed phenomena ;
and if so, we shall ascertain what these numerical values are. If successful we shall
thus have a formulation of the phenomena in a mathematical scheme, which ought to
serve as a guide in the elaboration of physical theory.
