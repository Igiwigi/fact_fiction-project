In fact, the variability of compiled diatoms’ sinking speeds (obtained from many species
in different physiological states [31]) is so huge (blue light dots), that we cannot reasonably
consider such a simple law to hold universally. Beyond geometrical effect (on viscous forces)
due to the diversity of cell shapes, this variability suggests active buoyancy regulation by the
cells depending on their physiological states [32], and therefore on the environment (light [33],
nutrients [34]) they are confronted with. In fact, it has been shown that diatoms have evolved different means by which to regulate
their density. They do so at a metabolic cost by bio-silicification [35], active replacement of
heavy ions by light ions in the vacuole [36-38] (that in some cases occupies up to 90% of the
cytoplasm) or carbohydrate reduction [39,40]. These diverse mechanisms take place over distinct
time scales: while an increase in cell silicification occurs in periods of several hours to days,
and carbohydrates accumulate and act as ballasts in a few minutes, ion replacement occurs in
even shorter time scales.
