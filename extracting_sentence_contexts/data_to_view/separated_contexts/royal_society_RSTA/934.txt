According to this stance, i.e. the ‘two abuses’ doctrine, granting AI
robots legal personhood would be morally unnecessary and legally troublesome, for holding AI
robots accountable outweighs the highly precarious moral interests that AI legal personhood
might protect [3]. Although this argument has its strengths, it still confuses the apples of legal
accountability with the oranges of legal personhood. As a matter of fact, in the legal domain, it is
not true that, if we do not have apples, neither oranges as a result. The final part of the paper offers a map on how we may tackle the normative impact of AI
robots on the civil (as opposed to the criminal) law field. Contrary to current trends of the debate
on the legal status(es) of Al robots, §5 advocates a pragmatic approach.
