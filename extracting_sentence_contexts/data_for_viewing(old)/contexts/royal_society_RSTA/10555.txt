This example is sufficient to show that when the gas is compressible, the tendency
of gravitation may be towards instability. The gravitation of the surface inequalities
will as before tend towards stability, but when we are dealing with a gaseous nebula,
it is impossible to suppose that a discontinuity of density can oceur such as would be .
necessary if this tendency were to come into operation. Rotation as before will tend
to instability, and the factor which makes for stability will be the elasticity of
the gas.

We can now see that there is nothing inherently impossible, or even improbable,
in the supposition that for a gaseous nebula the symmetrical configuration may
become unstable even in the absence of rotation. The question which we shall
primarily attempt to answer is, whether or not this is, in point of fact, a possible
occurrence, and if so, under what circumstances it will take place. To investigate
this problem, it will be sufficient to consider the vibrations of a non-rotating nebula
about a configuration of spherical symmetry.

which lends itself well to mathematical treatment. The principal difficulty lies in
finding a system which shall satisfy the ordinarily assumed gas equations, and shall
at the same time give an adequate representation of the primitive nebula of
