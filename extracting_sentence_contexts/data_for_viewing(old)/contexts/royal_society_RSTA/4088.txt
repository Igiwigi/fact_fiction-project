similarly. This occurs because the leading order mode of the distortion made by an isolated 8 |
particle is the same for all particles. Theory predicting pair interaction energies have been derived.

Trajectories obeying associated power laws that are consistent for this form of interaction have 3
been reported for several particle shapes. In the near field, details of particle shape and wetting 78
conditions come into play, with associated energy fields that dictate preferred orientations and :<
strengths of the structures formed. The ubiquitous nature of the far-field distortion becomes : Zs
particularly important when thinking of isolated particles in curved interfaces (below). Details 13

like particle aspect ratio, shape, corners or sharp edges, and roughness become important in the
near field. In some cases, the energetic consequences of these details can be addressed analytically.
In others, simulation must be used, as details of particle and interface area together determine the :
interaction. The fact that the near-field interactions occur, and play a strong role in the structures 18
that form, allows particle shape and wetting conditions to be used to tailor aggregate properties :

(b) Microparticles on curved interfaces: experiment R

We have developed a technique to define interface curvature in settings suitable for optical as)
microscopy. A curved oil—water interface is formed around a micropost of height Hm and :B
radius Rm. Far from the micropost is a confining ring, located several capillary lengths from the :8
micropost centre. This structure is filled with water so that the contact line pins at the sharp 1a
edge of the micropost and the slope of the interface is shallow, e.g. y ~ 15—18° (figure 7a,b). Oil
(typically hexadecane) is gently poured onto this water layer. The resulting interface shape close
