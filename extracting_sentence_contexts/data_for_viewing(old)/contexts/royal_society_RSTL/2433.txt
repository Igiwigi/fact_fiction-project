631. The dissipation of the vapour produced at the surface of the platina, and the
contact of fresh oxygen and hydrogen with the metal, form no difficulty in this expli-
cation. The platina is not considered as causing the combination of any particles
with itself, but only associating them closely around it ; and the compressed particles
are as free to move from the platina, being replaced by other particles, as a portion
of dense air upon the surface of the globe, or at the bottom of a deep mine, is free to
move by the slightest impulse into the upper and rarer parts of the atmosphere.

632. It can hardly be necessary to give any reasons why platina does not show this
effect under ordinary circumstances. It is then not sufficiently clean (617.), and
the gases are prevented from touching it, and suffering that degree of effect which is
needful to commence their combination at common temperatures, and which they can
only experience at its surface. In fact, the very power which causes the combination
of oxygen and hydrogen is competent, under the usual casual exposure of platina, to
condense extraneous matters upon its surface, which soiling it, take away for the time
its power of combining oxygen and hydrogen by preventing their contact with it.

633. Clean platina, by which I mean such as has been made the positive pole of a
pile (570.), or has been treated with acid (605.), and has then been put into distilled
water for twelve or fifteen minutes, has a peculiar friction when one piece is rubbed
