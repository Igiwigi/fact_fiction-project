This varnish was
soaked up by the silk covering of the wire and served the purpose of preventing
the silk taking up moisture from the air and thus losing in part its insulating
properties. The wires joining the two coils were led along the cylindrical surface of
the coils in the same horizontal plain as the centre of the coils. In this position
these wires produce at the centre of the coils no magnetic field which has a
horizontal component, and hence the fact that they are distant from one another by
about 1 millim, from centre to centre can produce no error. The insulation of the circuits was tested before and after the experiments and was
found to exceed 200 megohms both from one circuit to the other and from each of
the circuits to the flanges. The insulation of the rubber-covered leads and of
the Pohl commutator used to reverse the current was also tested and found
practically infinite.
