blished rule of never publishing any facts relating to electro-physiology without having
previously endeayoured to connect them with those already discovered, and without
having succeeded in reproducing them in such a constant and unyarying manner as
to remove the slightest doubt of their truth. The announcement, however, just made
to the Acad6mie des Sciences by M. pu Bots Raymonp of a work *On the Law of Mus-
cular Current, and on the Modification which that law undergoes by the effect of Con-
traction,‚Äù obliges me, though unwillingly, to transmit to the Royal Society the con-
tinuation of my researches on induced contraction, confining myself, for the present.,
to s8ome fundamental experiments, made a long time since, for the publication of
which I should have wished to await a more favourable moment.

In the Third and Fifth Series of my Electro-physiological Researches*, I studied,
with all possible care, and in its minute details, the fact of induced contraction, in order
to deduce the law of this phenomenon, and from thence to be led to the discovery of
its cause. In the Fifth Series, principally, I was led to conclude, that, according to all
the analogies, and without being in opposition to the experiments, induced contrac-
tion might be considered to be the effect of an electric discharge which takes place
during the act of muscular contraction. ;

In a memoir published in the Annales de Physique et de Chimie, Octobre 1847,
after having given an exposition of the laws of the electrical discharge of fish, and
demonstrated all the analogies existing between this function and muscular contrac-
tion, I declared still more explicitly, that experiment leads to the admission that in
muscular contraction there is a phenomenon analogous to that of the discharge of
the Leyden phial, and which was the cause of induced contraction. Nevertheless it
