fectly clear for three weeks, those in hydrogen the same. The tubes in air developed
very faint films, more pronounced at 25°C. than at 15° C.; but no further growths
occurred even after three months. It is worth notice that the tubes put into CO,
and then in hydrogen also started to form these rudimentary films after being a week

* These tubes were kept for several months longer and nothing occurred to alter the conclusions
drawn at the time I regarded the experiments as ended, but, on the contrary, these conclusions were
strengthened by the after events.

in air, but not so long as they were in hydrogen. But the most striking fact is that,
comparing tube with tube of each series, those tubes infected with the gelatinous form
behaved exactly like those infected with the free motile rodlets.

Now let us turn to the two groups, A to E inclusive, and I. to V. inclusive, the
tubes of bouillon. These again behaved similarly, comparing tube with tube. In
CO, the tubes A and I. remained clear at first, and then began to develop thin films,
which precipitated white flocks to the bottom of the tubes. Nothing more happened,
even after three months.

In hydrogen the tubes B and II. turned slightly turbid, and formed the precipitate
during the first week. Nothing further occurred.
