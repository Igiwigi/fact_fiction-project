From a veſſel about a league ſouth-weſt from Cape
Cod, and from Martha's Vineyard, we have received
like accounts of a bright ball in the heavens, ſuf.
ficient to aſcertain the reality of the meteor, but not

The other account I had-in view, is -of a whirt-
wind, which happened on Tueſday, the 10th of this
inſtant July, at Leiceſter, a town in this province,
ſituated about 4o miles weſt from hence. In point
of violence, it ſeems to have equalled any, and ex-
ceeded moſt, that have happened in this country, ſo

indeed, moſt, that are recorded in the Philoſophical
Tranfadtions. I was very deſirous to have gone myſelf,
to take a view of its deſtructive effes, but an infirm
ſtate of health has prevented me, However, I have
received ſuch informations from ſeveral gentlemen,
who have been on the ſpot, as enable me to give a
particular account of it; in which I ſhall relate no-
thing but what, I am well aſſured, may be relied on
as fact,

The morning of the 1oth July with us, at Cam-
bridge, was fair and hot, with a briſk gale at ſouth-
weſt. The afternoon was cloudy. About five, it
began to rain, and 'thundered once, At Leiceſter,
ſeveral people of credit fay, that about five o'clock

weſt and north-welt ſeemed to ruſh together very
ſwiftly, and, immediately upon their meeting, com-
menced a circular motion ; preſently after which, a
terrible noiſe was heard, The whirlwind marched
along from ſouth-weſt to north-weſt, Its firlt effets
were diſcernible on a hill, where ſeveral trees were
thrown down, at conſiderable diſtances from each
other. | On: the north-eaſt fide of this hill, was a

tree, which ſeemed to have been ftript of its limbs
| onthe ſouth fide, nearly from the top to the bottom.
