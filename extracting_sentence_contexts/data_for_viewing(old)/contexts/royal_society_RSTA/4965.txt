One important question is whether the current sheets inferred from solar wind observations
are all dynamically generated by the turbulence itself [188,189], or whether some fraction of the
current sheets merely represent advected flux tube boundaries [190-193]. I have highlighted in
§2h recent research that explains, from first principles, the development of current sheets in
plasma turbulence as a natural consequence of the nonlinear energy transfer caused by strong
Alfvén wave collisions [20]. If this mechanism operates in the solar wind, then at least some of
the observed current sheets consist of a constructively interfering sum of counter-propagating
Alfvén waves. This finding provides new insight into the underlying nature of dynamically
generated current sheets in plasma turbulence, and the damping of the associated turbulent
electromagnetic fluctuations may indeed be dominated by collisionless wave—particle interactions
via the Landau resonance, as previously suggested by a recent analysis of gyrokinetic numerical
simulations [134]. If these conjectures are correct, then the fact that the heating is concentrated in
current sheets is merely a consequence of the turbulent nonlinear dynamics but does not deterntine the
mechanism of dissipation. This idea does not conflict with results, reported elsewhere in this theme
issue [187], that suggest intermittency develops identically in both ideal and resistive MHD
simulations.

°Note that this Larmor radius p is not the thermal ion Larmor radius ; = v;i/.;, but rather is the gyroradius for an ion with
a particular perpendicular velocity v,.


A statement that is likely to prove very controversial is that intermittency, although a well-
established characteristic of plasma turbulence, may not be critically important for the prediction
of the plasma heating due to the dissipation of turbulent fluctuations, particularly if coherent
