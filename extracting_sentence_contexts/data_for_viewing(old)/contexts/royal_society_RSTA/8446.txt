Notr.—The small discrepancies between columns 3 and 6 are due to the fact that column 6 is derived
from the measured values of the d separations averaged directly, while the term values v/C* in column 3 are
derived from terms obtained by distributing the errors of measurement somewhat differently.

(6.3.) The Diffuse Term Separations.

Let us now examine the d, — d, separations which are given in Table IV.

In the last column is printed Av/C? for d, —d,. The remarkable fact is evident that
Av/C* is constant for a given sequence, while » remains unchanged. The peculiar nature
of the d terms will be dealt with below (§6.4). It seems that for the are spectra the
3d term corresponds to a 3, orbit, but in the remaining spectra they are 4;, The

sudden change in the value of Av/C* lends strength to the idea of there being some
such discontinuity.

The variations in Av/C? are somewhat beyond experimental error, and are rather
irregular, but, assuming the classifications adopted to be correct, we have that roughly
