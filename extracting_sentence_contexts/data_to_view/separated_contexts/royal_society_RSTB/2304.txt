GASES AND LIQUIDS, ETC., IN PLANTS. 227

somewhat remarkable conclusion that during assimilation the absorption per unit
area of these openings must be from 43 to 64 times as fast as the absorption of a
unit area of a freely exposed solution of caustic alkali. In other words, under the
natural conditions of assimilation the stomatal openings, supposing them alone to be
operative, must take in carbon dioxide from the air about 50 times as fast as they
would do supposing it were possible to fill them with a constantly renewed solution
of caustic alkali. A consideration of such facts as these leads us to demand more evidence before we
can unreservedly accept the proposition that the gaseous exchanges of assimilation
take place exclusively through the fine openings of the leaf stomata. It is, in fact,
imperative to demonstrate beyond all doubt that such a view is in no way inconsistent
with the known or ascertainable properties of carbon dioxide and air, as regards their
powers of interdiffusion under conditions comparable with those existing in the
living leaf. In its simplest form the problem resolves itself into a study of the free diffusion
of very dilute carbon dioxide through small apertures of known dimensions, opening
out into an internal space whose limiting walls are more or less absorbent of the gas,
and expose a surface which is very large compared with the area of the apertures.
