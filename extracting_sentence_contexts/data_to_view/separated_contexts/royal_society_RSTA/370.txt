There are two points to highlight with this chart. First, there is a fan
around the historical data, to the left of the black vertical line. That reflects
the fact that output data are frequently revised over timeâ€”sometimes heavily. The CPI, in contrast, is rarely revised. The chart shows that there was a lot of
uncertainty about the past data.
