Then, since S* is a
maximum at P,

or «z is a numerical maximum. But since

therefore also

and it is well known that no function can have an absolute maximum or an absolute
minimum inside a region where it satisfies LarLacr’s equation, This is in fact a
particular case of the general theorem that a potential cannot have a maximum in
free space.
