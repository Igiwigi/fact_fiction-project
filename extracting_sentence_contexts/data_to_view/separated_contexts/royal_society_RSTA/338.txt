A more realistic attitude is to assume that
the components are bound to have some dependencies. Then, the central question is whether
independence is a useful assumption for a particular dataset in the sense that it allows for
estimation of meaningful components. In fact, empirical results tend to show that ICA estimation
seems to be rather robust against some violations of the independence assumption. On the other hand, modelling dependencies of the estimated components is an important
extension of the analysis provided by ICA. It can give useful information on the interactions
between the components or sources recovered by ICA.
