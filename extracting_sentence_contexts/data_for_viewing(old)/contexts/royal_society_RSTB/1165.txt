attachment to the cord, and that there are no fibres which pass directly from the
columns of the cord (above) outwards into the anterior roots without interruption in a
nerve centre. If any uninterrupted fibres exist, then the excitation of the central
end of an anterior root ought to give an effect in the galvanometer as arranged in
this experiment, for it is well known that the excitatory state (7.e., negative variation)
travels indifferently in either direction along continuous tracts. The absence of such
effect is a very convincing proof that such through fibres do not exist. Moreover, an
additional point receives elucidation from this same experiment. We have already
drawn attention to the fact that the anatomical relations of the pyramidal tract
fibres are for the most part (and wholly as far as the lower limb is concerned) not
With the efferent side of the spinal centres but rather with either the field of con-
fiction or the afferent aspect.

2This anatomical juxtaposition of parts suggests to us that the pyramidal tract fibres
for the lower limb do not immediately end in the efferent corpuscles. Such a con-
fasion is in harmony with the experimental results now under discussion, for it is
aBreasonable to suppose that the excitatory process would be so entirely blocked
when proceeding in the reverse direction along a path consisting merely of two fibres
(at of the anterior root and that of the pyramidal tract) joined by a large corpuscle
stich as one of those in the ventral (anterior) horn.
