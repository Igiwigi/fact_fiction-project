elements of the video scene that influenced monkeysâ€™ gaze, we
included gaze consistency and the proportion of gaze-out-of-
frame observations as regressors along with the ethogram vari-
ables. As estimators of per-view decision processes, we included
gaze typicality and gaze-out-of-frame as regressors as well.

A final challenge was the principled selection of the window
duration used to count spikes, each window forming an indepen-
dent observation in our regression model. Because both neuronal
firing rates and ethogram regressors are temporally autocorre-
lated, selection of an analysis window shorter than the scale of
neural firing rate autocorrelation would bias our model toward
false positives, due to the fact that adjacent bins would be
highly correlated in the data while treated as independent by
the model. Conversely, the selection of too large an analysis
window would risk failing to adequately represent some of the
briefer behaviours in the ethogram and could violate the assump-
tion of stationarity within each window. The autocorrelation
function, for example neurons taken from the 5s window
during Blank presentations, revealed that the autocorrelation coef-
ficient falls to below 0.1 at a lag of approximately 100 ms in the
absence of task stimuli (electronic supplementary material,
figure S1). On this basis, we selected a 200 ms window (twice
the 100 ms cutoff) to balance the needs to avoid autocorrelation
and maintain stationarity within each window. Thus, each video
