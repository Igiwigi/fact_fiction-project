f and F being arbitrary functions of their complex arguments. In the applications, one
function alone is usually sufficient, and it is customary to write

w= ¢-+ip=f(e) .........2...~ (122)

with z= « -- ty, when ¢ and 4 usually have each some physical significance. More-
over, in most cases, the boundary conditions which have to be satisfied either are, or
can be reduced to, the prescription of the boundary values of ¢ or $, or of their
derivatives.

The fact that a solution of (1.12) is obtained from functions of a complex variable
implies a conformal representation of the ¢ — 4 plane on the « — y plane, the resulting
net on the «—y plane being equipotentials and stream-lines (or their analogues).
Methods based on conformal representation for solving one class of hydrodynamical
problem, that of free stream-lines first examined by Krrcuorr and He_MHourz, have
been developed into a technique which can be applied to any obstacle having, in the
two-dimensional trace, straight boundaries, and some progress has been made with
