(49* Fau.) at the time of experiment, —segmentation of the yelk would hardly have
taken place. This supposition appears to be the more likely, when we recollect that
in the Set Q, and in that et only, the impregnating fluid was obtained from the testes,
compressed and broken down in water,—that the eggs were of doubtful maturity,—
and that this was the only set of experiments in which no embryos were ultimately
produced; although, I may now mention, that greater care was taken to ensure a
favourable result than in most of these investigations,—the ova being remoyed at the
end of twenty hours to an average temperature of 60* Fanr.,—were retained in flat
sballow dishes,—and had the water changed daily. Both sets, however, Q and R,
seem to prove that the act of impregnation, as evidenced in the fact of the yelk be-
coming segmented, must take place, or be commenced very rapidly ; and, apparently,
almost at the instant of contact of the spermatozoon with the coverings of the ovum ;
as seems to be shown in the fact, that segmentation took place in many of the ova
when the space of time between the application of the spermatozoon, and that of the
solution,—which previous observation (p. 225) showed was sufficient to decompose it
immediately,—was scarcely more than one or #wo $econds. Thus in Q 4, and R 1, it
must have commenced in the interval of one second, even when the strong s0lution
was used ; and in Q 2 and R 2 with the same solution in #0 Seconds. When the
weaker solution was used, a greater number of ova became affected in similar spaces
of time, as in Q2 and 3. These experiments seem to show that the act of impreg-
nation had already been commenced before the application. of the solution ; as, in the
experiments which are the converse of those now mentioned, in regard to the time
when the spermatozoa and the solution were applied, a different result ensued. Thus
when the so{ution was applied to the oyum firs: as in Q 6 and R 3 and 4, and one
