time ——> This simple model has much to recommend it both
as a normative and descriptive account of categorical
choice. The DDM has been widely and very suc-
cessfully applied to decision-making in a range of

Ay cognitive domains—from low-level perceptual decisions
to retrieval of facts from semantic memory, to econo-
response time for trial | mic decision-making under uncertainty [6—8]—and

accounts neatly for several empirical characteristics of
reaction times (RTs) observed for binary choices in
response time for trial 2 these tasks. Firstly, the natural geometry of the accumu-
x lation-to-bound process predicts the observed rightward
skew in RT distributions. Secondly, varying the bound
offers an elegant account of the economy of speed and
accuracy that characterizes mental chronometry tasks.
