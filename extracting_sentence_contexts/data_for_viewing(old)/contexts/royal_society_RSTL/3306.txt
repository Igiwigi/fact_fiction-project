which will perhaps throw light on the origin of the shelves. The valley of the Spean,
from the point where it joins the Great Glen of Scotland to where it receives the
Roy, is broad, and its bottom moderately level. The solid rock is concealed in al-
most every part, excepting where the river has cut itself a gorge, by irregularly hori-
zontal strata of gravel, sand, and mud. Large portions of these beds have been re-
moved along the centre of the valley, yet it is quite eyident from the fringe or line of
terraces which skirt each side, that the bottom must originally have formed a smooth
concave surface inclined towards the mouth of the valley. Portions more or less
perfect of this same deposit can be followed up the course of the Roy, and up the
higher parts of the Spean, where the valley is not too rocky or narrow, to near Loch
Laggan. This loch is but little below the 972-feet shelf; and at present I wish, for
the sake of the independence of the argument derived from the facts to be stated, to
consider only that part of the country which is below the leyel of that shelf. These
irregularly stratified beds, near the mouth of the Spean, attain a thickness of several
hundred feet, and they consist of sand and pebbles, many of the latter being perfectly
waterworn. Higher up the valley, near the bridge of Roy, the thickness before the
central portions were remoyed appears to have been about sixty feet, but of course
the thickness varies according to the original irregularities of the rocky bottom of
the valley. Now it may be asked by what agency has this sloping sheet of water-
worn materials been deposited along the course of the yalley? From the presence of
the horizontal shelves we know that there has been no change in the relative level
or inclination of the country since this district was last covered with water, and
therefore we may argue with safety, that the action of the rivers, as far as it is deter-
mined by their inclination, must have been the same since that period as it now is,
