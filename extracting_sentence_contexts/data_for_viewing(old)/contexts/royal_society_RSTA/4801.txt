here in the first-order form and where e}, stands for the vielbein and Vy for the Weitzenbick
connection. The Meller Lagrangian differs from the Einstein—Hilbert term by a total derivative.
Here the equivalence between the theories is most manifest. Hence, there exists a framework
based entirely on torsion that one could use to study the effect of mass, which above led to
the presence of torsion in an otherwise curvature-based description. In fact, every detuning
of the relative factors between the differently contracted torsion tensors in (4.1) leads to the
propagation of additional degrees of freedom, and, as we have seen, such detuning contributions
are introduced by the mass term. Moreover, the teleparellel description is an Abelian gauge theory
of the translation group (we have a Lagrangian quadratic in the field strength and not linear in the
curvature like the Einstein—Hilbert action) of the translational potential and as such much closer
to the theory we wanted to analyse in a geometric setting.

Another unifying viewpoint comes from a somewhat unexpected direction, higher gauge
theory: above, we described standard gauge field theories in a geometric setting. In three
dimensions, we found a clear-cut link of mass to torsion, and torsion is the principal ingredient of
teleparallel gravity. In four (and more) dimensions, the situation is slightly less straightforward,
but there gauge theory is related (at zero coupling) to BF theory. Exactly these two theories,
