Nay1.7 have been identified as common only to the naked to differential proton sensitivity within a single species, in


the case of the naked mole-rat, life in a safe, but hypercapnic
environment has resulted in loss of somatic proton-induced
nociception, but the homeostatic role of acidification in the
gastrointestinal tract (e.g. pathogen elimination) has led to
maintained sensory neuron proton sensitivity. Overall, the co-expression of different proton-sensitive
receptors by nociceptors allows integration of localized acido-
sis to a number of intracellular signalling events within
nociceptors.
