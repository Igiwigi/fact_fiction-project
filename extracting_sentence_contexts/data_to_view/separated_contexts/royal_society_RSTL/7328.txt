In the Marmot, when in profound sleep, the con-
actions of the heart occur at long intervals, which, however, are much exceeded in

ration by those which separate the respirations. By connecting the carotid artery

ith the kymographion (which can be done without waking the animal), a tracing was
ſue from which it appeared that the mercurial column sank during the first third
& inspiration, rose during the second two thirds, continued to rise during the beginning
& expiration, and again fell during the remainder. Of these facts he gives the following
tQeoretical explanation :—* 'The negative inspiration-pressure not only sucks air into the
kings, but blood towards the heart. The greater impletion of the heart enables it to
Fopel more blood into the arteries, and increases its frequency, while its contraction as
E@mpared with its relaxation is prolonged. Expiration produces an opposite result ; for
# facilitates the emptying of the lungs of blood, and adds to the systemic pressure.
