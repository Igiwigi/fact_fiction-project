that the weak polymer entanglement without substantial shear thinning, normally obtained for
PAAM solutions, can enhance the elastic behaviour of the fluids. Another explanation is due to
the different methods and inconsistencies in the definition of polymer relaxation time and El. The
graph also implies the existence of a triple co-dimension point (TP) in the chart at which there is
a balance among inertial, elastic and shear-thinning effects. At this point, TVF, RSW and FP could
have a significant role in the same transition sequence.

Point ‘1’ in figure 7 illustrates a TVF/RSW coexistence without the appearance of FP in the
transition. This implies that this point is more of a co-dimension point between shear-thinning
and moderately elastic fluids. Instead, point ‘2’ in figure 7 illustrates all TVF, RSW, and EIT and
is closer to the TP point discussed earlier. The fact that point ‘2’ (TP) lies outside the overlapping
region of ID, ED and INT implies a distorted shape of the graph due to experimental inaccuracies
and inconsistencies.

An open matter is still the nature of EIT as it consists of both inertial and elastic effects. The
indications so far point toward a strong similarity between EIT and ET [118,151]. The nature
and mechanism of ET and EIT are reviewed by [19], covering the whole spectrum of published
experimental and numerical works to date. In their recent article, [129] implemented the first
three-dimensional DNS study to highlight the mechanistic differences between EIT and ET. To
this end, the authors argue that EIT arises as a result of the interaction between polymer shear
stresses and shear flow, with the first one being the dominant contributor to the total turbulent
kinetic energy. On the other hand, ET arises from the chaotic events of the polymer extension and
relaxation caused by the interaction of unsteady DW and fluid perturbations.
