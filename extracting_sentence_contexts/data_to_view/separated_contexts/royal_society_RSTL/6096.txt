W. HOFMANN ON THE PHOSPHORUS-BASES.

forms an angle of about 30* with a line normal on face 001. In fact, a plate parallel
to 010 stops the passage of a ray of polarized light in that direction. Moreover, rings
are observed through the faces 0 01, and in a plane parallel to the line of symmetry
010, and rather inclined towards a line normal on such face. The angle of the optical
axes, 8een in this manner through the faces 0 0 1, appears to be very nearly 1109s.
