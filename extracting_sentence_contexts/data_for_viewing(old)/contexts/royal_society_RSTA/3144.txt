mathematical theories. Echoing once again ideas found in the introduction to Hertz’s textbook,
and clearly having in mind the problematic conceptual situation of the kinetic theory of gases
at the turn of the century, Hilbert stressed the need to analyse carefully the process whereby
physicists continually add new assumptions to existing physical theories, without properly
checking whether or not the former contradict the latter, or consequences of the latter. In a letter
of 29 December 1899, Hilbert wrote to Frege:

After a concept has been fixed completely and unequivocally, it is on my view completely

illicit and illogical to add an axiom—a mistake made very frequently, especially by : =
physicists. By setting up one new axiom after another in the course of their investigations, 3
without confronting them with the assumptions they made earlier, and without showing 13
that they do not contradict a fact that follows from the axioms they set up earlier, physicists : =
often allow sheer nonsense to appear in their investigations. One of the main sources :2
of mistakes and misunderstandings in modern physical investigations is precisely the : =
procedure of setting up an axiom, appealing to its truth, and inferring from this that it [oS
is compatible with the defined concepts. One of the main purposes of my Festschrift was to D8
avoid this mistake. [24, p. 40] : S

In a different passage of the same letter, Hilbert commented on the possibility of substituting
the basic objects of an axiomatically formulated theory by a different system of objects, provided
the latter can be put in a one-to-one, invertible relation with the former. In this case, the known
theorems of the theory are equally valid for the second system of objects. Concerning physical
