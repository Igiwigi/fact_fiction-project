It is this
difficulty which in part accounts for the various formulas which have been advanced. Another somewhat important consideration is that, if you assume an equation of
the form S = aP‚Äù for a tubular propellant, all tubes that have the same annulus
should give the same ballistics. It seems clear from experimental firings in guns that
the size of hole for a given annulus has an influence on ballistics, There is no
explanation of this fact in the simple equation formula, but it is at once explained by
the system of calculation which I have here set forth. The system also explains the
splits in the tubes and all the various phenomena connected with the combustion of
tubular propellants. At the same time it is possible to obtain also for tubes a reduction equation of the
form Redn, = aP+C.
