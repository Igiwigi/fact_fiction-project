In October, 1898, in-view of what was known regarding the
organisms of the nodules of Leguminosze, the attempt was made to grow Desmodium
in its native soil from Calcutta, with the result that healthy plants bearing flowers,
fruits, and seeds were secured, and in addition numerous nodules appeared on the

roots. Whether this is due to the existence of the specific organism especially adapted to
Desmodium which is entirely absent from the soil of this district, or whether the
unhealthiness of the plants themselves, arising from the unsuitability of the soil,
had prevented the organism from penetrating the roots, is an open question. From
further experiments, the results of which Mr. Lyncw has kindly communicated to
me, and from the fact that, as will be shown later, there are no characters peculiar to
the organisms obtained from these tubercles which distinguish them from those
obtained from every other genus, I am disposed to think that failure in growing these
plants was due to the presence of some injurious factor—possibly organisms—in the

Cambridge soil, rather than the entire absence from it of a specific organism capable
of producing tubercles upon Desmodium roots. 1 may add that I have confirmed the
above results. A detailed examination was then made of the nodules borne by this genus—
Desmodium—and, as is described on p. 55, pure cultures were made of the organism
concerned in their formation, since this was observed to be of an unusually large size,

and therefore especially well adapted for detailed microscopic study.
