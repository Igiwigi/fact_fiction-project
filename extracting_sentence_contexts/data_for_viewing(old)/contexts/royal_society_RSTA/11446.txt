140 MR. S. S. HOUGH ON THE APPLICATION OF HARMONIC

a very lengthy analysis similar to that used by the latter writer. The comparative
simplicity of these results seemed, however, to point to the fact that they might be
more easily obtained by less pretentious means. The deduction of the formule in
the former paper from the differential equation of LapLacr presented no serious
difficulties, but in attempting to apply a like method to obtain the more general
formule of the present paper, I found that formidable obstacles had to be overcome.
The method of integration now adopted seems to leave little to be desired for sim-
plicity, considering its generality, but the fact that it has been built up partly by
working forwards from the differential equation, and partly by working backwards
from the results, must account for the apparent artificiality of the procedure.

In all previous attempts at the solution of the dynamical equations for the tides,
the integration has been effected by assuming that the expression for the tide-height
could be expressed by an infinite series of terms of known form associated with
