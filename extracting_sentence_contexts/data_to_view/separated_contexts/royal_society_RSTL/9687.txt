From the title of our paper, ib will at once be concluded that the experiments were
originally undertaken and arranged from an agricultural point of view. But, as
experimenting on the feeding of animals s00n led us into lines of enquiry of even more
interest to the chemist, the animal physiologist, and the dietetician than to the agri-
culturist, 80 the investigation of the effects of different manures on the mixed herbage
of grass land has led us far beyond the limits of a purely agricultural problem, and has
afforded results of more interest to the botanist, the vegetable physiologist, and the
chemist, than to the farmer. Indeed, agriculture—the most primitive, and commonly
esteemed the rudest of the arts—requires for the elucidation of the principles involved
in its various practices a very wide range of scientific enquiry ; and the investigation
of them may, in its turn, contribute facts of interest to the student of various and
very distinch branches of natural knowledge. It will be readily understood that, as a necessary foundation for the discussion of the
botany and the chemistry of the subject, it will be essential first to put on record, and
call attention to, what may be distinguished as the agricultural data. It is proposed,
then, to arrange and consider the results obtained under the following heads :—
