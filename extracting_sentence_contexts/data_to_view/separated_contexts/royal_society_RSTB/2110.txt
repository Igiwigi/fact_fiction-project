The greater amount of the proteid present is coagulable by heat between

+ 73°-80° C. The greater amount of the proteid is precipitable by saturation with

& magnesium sulphate, and therefore consists of globulin or nucleo-proteid or both ;

8 there is, however, a small amount of true albumin which remains in the filtrate after

§ removal of the precipitate produced by saturation with magnesium sulphate.
s That nucleo-proteid is present was determined in the following way: the cerebro-

2 & spinal fluid as each autopsy was performed was mixed with excess of alcohol, until

¢ at last over a litre of the fluid had been collected. The precipitated proteid was
collected, well washed with alcohol and with water, and then subjected to artificial
5 3 gastric digestion ; at the end of a week the undissolved residue was collected ; it was
2 found to have the solubilities of nuclein, and this was confirmed by the fact that it
a “@ contained a high percentage of phosphorus; this was done in the following way: the

2 residue was well washed with 0-2 per cent. hydrochloric acid to remove any still
aed inorganic phosphates; then heated for some hours on the water bath at

3 100° C. with fuming nitric acid, to which a small quantity of sulphuric acid was

s, “3 added, and an occasional pinch of potassium chlorate.* The residue was dissolved in
£ nitrie acid, and ammonium molybdate added; on warming, an abundant yellow

@ crystalline precipitate settled out. The experiment was not performed quantitatively,

= but we judge the amount of phosphorus was large, from the abundance of the

& precipitate relatively to the small amount of material investigated.

3 There can be little doubt that the nucleo-proteid originates from the disintegration

3 of the brain cells; one of us has already shown the presence of nucleo-proteid in the

© cerebral tissue,t and this nucleo-proteid when injected intravenously in rabbits

E causes intravascular coagulation.{

Q The question will therefore be asked whether injection of the cerebro-spinal fluid
from General Paralytics causes intravascular coagulation. We have injected samples
of cerebro-spinal fluid from about fifty cases of General Paralysis, but in the majority
of these instances, after we had found the fall of blood-pressure to be due to choline,
we precipitated the proteids by alcohol first.
