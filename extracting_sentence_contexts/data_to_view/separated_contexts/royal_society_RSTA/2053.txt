P (x,t;) being fixed. This equation shows that the spatial integral of the auxiliary field is not necessarily a conserved
quantity, in contrast with the probability distribution function. A crucial point is the fact that equations (2.2) and (2.11) are identical to each other. It is
therefore concluded that the auxiliary field introduced into the action for the Fokkerâ€”Planck equation
is a weak invariant associated with the equation. In this way, the auxiliary field, which used to be a
mathematical object introduced rather formally, is now endowed with a physical significance.
