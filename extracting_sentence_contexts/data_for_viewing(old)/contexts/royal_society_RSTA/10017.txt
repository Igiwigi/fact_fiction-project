128 MR. W. GEOFFREY DUFFIELD ON THE

Without the lens K, the direction of the beam of light passing through the window
would change as the arc shifted its position, and it would be necessary to alter the angles
of the mirrors and the position of the lens L in order to keep the image in focus on the
slit, but the lens K has been arranged to move up or down just as much as the are
moves up or down, by means of the system of pulleys shown in the diagram, which
ensures the vertical motion of the lens being equal to the horizontal motion of the
mirror M; when M moves towards the are, L is pulled up, and vice versd. The ray
passing horizontally through the window thus always proceeds through the centres of
the second lens, the slit and the grating, and all danger of a fictitious shift due to
want of centrality is obviated. When the are fluctuates horizontally round the poles
the image is brought back upon the slit by turning the mirror M about its pivots ;
the motion required is very small and the adjustment can be made rapidly enough for
an experienced operator to keep the image of the are almost continually in position.
Since the are and slit are in the focal planes of their respective lenses the image is
always in good focus.

The turning of the mirror about its long axis is effected by the screw F, which
presses against a projection T from the back of the frame holding the mirror, a spring
keeping F and T in close contact. Universal joints were attached to the ends of E
and F, and long handles provided, fig. 2, Plate 3, so that the assistant whose duty
it was to keep the image on the slit was not too close to the window.
