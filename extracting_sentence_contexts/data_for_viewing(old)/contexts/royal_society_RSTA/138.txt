overcome many of the current architectural limitations of the current Internet.
The one application type that is not completely accommodated in this framework
is real-time streaming or real-time applications in general. Firstly, the suitability
of utility maximizing allocations for real-time flows is not as clear as for elastic

raffic, although one possible integration is described in Key et al. (2004).
Secondly, it is not possible to give a hard QoS guarantees over a best-effort
network. Thirdly, it is not easy to justify implementing rate-adaptive real-time
streaming, since there is a little incentive for an application to limit its rate. At

he time of writing, the volume of real-time traffic is small, when compared with

data traffic, and some argue that this fact if coupled with a degree of over-
provisioning in the network is sufficient to provide soft guarantees that are
acceptable in practice.

An alternative scenario to the current status quo is one where some form of
pricing is used to relate path prices to real prices, via congestion prices. This
orings advantages in terms of controllability and incentive compatibility, and
allows for the QoS differentiation for real-time traffic. Whether the hurdles of
accounting, billing and diverse ownership can be overcome, or are worth
overcoming, is a moot point. We have suggested a possible evolution path that
may allow some intermediate form of pricing linked to quality to be introduced,
provided transit ISPs can charge end-hosts for transit traffic.
