A third negative containing four exposures in the ratio of
1:4: 16: 64, together with an iron comparison spectrum, was taken with Dr. ANDERSONâ€™s
apparatus. In this last plate the lines due to gallium could be distinguished from those
due to aluminium by the fact that the lines due to the latter element grew progressively
stronger with increasing exposure, whereas, owing to the gradual consumption of the
gallium amalgamation of the electrodes, the lines due to gallium at first increased and
later decreased in intensity with increasing exposure. The reduction of the measurements of the ScHumMANN plates to wave-lengths was
effected by aid of the aluminium lines present and certain impurities (e.g., C, O, N)
and it was further checked by certain lines in common with the negative obtained by
the condenser discharge which was measured by comparison with the iron spectrum
That is to say, a combination of Methods A and B was used. Very satisfactory agree-
ment was obtained between measures on different plates and a general accuracy of
about 0-1 A can be claimed.
