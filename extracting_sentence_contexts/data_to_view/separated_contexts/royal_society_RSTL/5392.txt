ProposrTron NV.â€”Tnzorem. Every Isothermal line for an aggregate of a
liquid and its vapour, is a straight line of equal pressure, from the volume corresponding
to complete liquefaction to the volume corresponding to complete evaporation. This is a fact known by experiment. The Theorem is equivalent to a Statement,
that the pressnre of a liquid and its vapour in contact with each other, is a function
of the temperature only. Corollary.
