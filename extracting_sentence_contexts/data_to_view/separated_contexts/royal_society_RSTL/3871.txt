As might have been anticipated from the results obtained in the methyl-series,
disulphetholic acid is by no means the sole product of the action of sulphuric acid

upon propionamide and propionitrile. The formation of this acid is preceded, by that

of another acid richer in carbon and poorer in sulphur, in one word, by that of sulpho-
propionic acid. The uncrystallizable ammonium-salt, already mentioned, is in fact
the sulphopropionate of ammonium. Absolute alcohol throws it down from its

until entirely decomposed, and the filtered liquid concentrated in a beaker.
