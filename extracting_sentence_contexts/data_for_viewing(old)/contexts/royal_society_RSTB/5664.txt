sheets showing the following characteristics: they all give large amounts of “ carbon
unaccounted for,” high titratable acidity present entirely in the form of non-volatile
acids, but Ad. 76, Ad. 77 and Ad. 22 give moderate amounts of “ carbon in volatile
neutral compounds” with medium respiration coefficients, while, on the other hand,
Ad. 83 shows a complete absence of this type of metabolic product and has a respiration
coefficient approximating to unity. Ad. 15, however, has a carbon balance sheet
which, while in other respects very similar to those of Ad. 76, Ad. 77 and Ad. 22, is
differentiated by the fact that it does not produce any appreciable amount ot
titratable acidity.

This subsection is divided by Tom into a number of series. The following species,
which are arranged in their appropriate series, have been examined and their carbon
5 balance sheets are given in Table X.
