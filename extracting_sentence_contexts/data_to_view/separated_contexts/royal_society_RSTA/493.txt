At that point, there is a
sudden transition to a fast Petschek-like reconnection [55,56]. The sheet must be extremely thin,
however (ion skin depth without a guide field or ion gyro-radius with one). New simulations
show that fast reconnection can in fact occur at a much greater thickness, but only if the aspect
ratio of the current sheet (ratio of length to width) is at least 100 [57,58]. This suggests a scenario in
which footpoint driving decreases the thickness of current sheets, by enhancing the surrounding
magnetic pressure, until a critical thickness or aspect ratio is reached. Yet another possibility is a critical twist associated with the kink instability [30-32].
