This indicates that the effects of sliding are not
confined to the surface films of adsorbed lubricant but penetrate deeper so that
atoms or particles of the underlying metal are torn off during the process. It will
be noted that the value of the coefficient of kinetic friction is considerably smaller
than the coefficient of static friction measured by Harpy under similar conditions.
(ux is usually one-third to one-half ys.) It is assumed that in static friction the
frictional effects are confined to the primary adsorbed layers of lubricant. In order to compare the minimum friction obtained with the different series and
surfaces, it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that, with alcohols and
acids on steel, the coefficient of friction decreased with increase in load. Table XII
shows that the minimum value of kinetic friction (wk = 0-053) was obtained with
octyl alcohol as a lubricant between heavily loaded steel surfaces. A comparison is
made in Table XVIII of the lowest values of yx obtained by increasing the load
between the surfaces and the molecular weight of the lubricant.
