An individual meristele is organised in the normal way of ferns, and is therefore
concentrically arranged with central xylem. There, seems sufficient evidence to
suppose a complete endodermal sheath of small cells between the vascular tissues and
the small thick-walled elements of the ground tissue, for the endodermis is
remarkably clearly preserved round parts of the strands.

The Xylem forms a slightly interrupted single band in each of the meristeles, in
some places lying in a wavy line such as is usual in the Cyatheacew, and in others
forming a simple curve. The band contains one to three rows of xylem elements (see
x, Phots, 2 and 3, Plate 2) which vary considerably in size, from about 0Â°02 mm. to
0:08 mm. in diameter. These cells seem to offer no point.of distinction from the usual
type of Leptosporangiate tracheids. Owing to the fact that all the sections are
transverse, the nature of the pittings on the walls is not ascertainable, but the trans-
verse appearance is suggestive of scalariform pits. Protoxylems are not absolutely
determinable because the sections are all transverse, but along the xylem band are
several groups of small elements at intervals, among which are in all likelihood the
protoxylem elements, which thus seem to lie on the outer side of the band.

The cells between the xylem and the endodermis proved difficult of interpretation,
because they are of a distinctly unusual character. They can be seen in fig. 7 in
Plate 1, where the large size of the well-marked layer of cells p will be recognised at
once as a rather remarkable feature. We incline to interpret this clearly defined
layer of cells as a pericycle. In some Dicksonias the pericyle cells are markedly large,
although not so much developed as in the present case, and they afford some sort of
