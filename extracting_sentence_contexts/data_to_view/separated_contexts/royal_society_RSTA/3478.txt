These four permutations were returned in 82 out of 100 runs (seven returns of the top left,
19 of the bottom left, 27 of the top right and 29 of the bottom right). They have the same initial
three choices of customer, namely (3,2,1). In fact, the returned permutation started with (3, 2,1) in
98 out of 100 runs. By the heuristics discussed in the running example, part 6, variations at the beginning of
the permutation are likely to have the greatest effect on the objective function, and hence on
the accept-reject step of the SA algorithm. The random walk should therefore provide a clear
indication of the optimal initial order in which customers should be approached, and this heuristic
is clearly borne out in figure 1.
