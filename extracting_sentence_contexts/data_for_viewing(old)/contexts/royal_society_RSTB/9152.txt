expect that some pharmaceuticals will elicit adverse sublethal
responses in chronic exposures [5,6].

Generation of chronic ecotoxicity data for the large number
of pharmaceuticals that may (or do) enter aquatic environ-
ments would be prohibitively costly, as well as requiring
numerous test animals, which contradicts the growing inter-
national desire to decrease animal use. Given the number of
drugs in use or development (5000+; [9]), whole-organism
chronic toxicity studies for assessing all possible risks are
impractical, so techniques for the prioritization of those chemi-

The fact that a drug must be present in the environment for it
to cause adverse effects to non-target organisms is irrefutable.
However, considerations of pharmacokinetic measures, bio-
logical pathway interactions (both with potential for specific
and non-specific interactions) and knowledge of primary
drug-metabolizing enzymes and conservation of molecular
targets, can provide enhanced potential to rank and prioritize
pharmaceuticals for their potential to cause unintended
effects to wildlife (figure 1).
