indication of a lower amount of atmospheric temperature than what really exists, and
consequently the apparent difference between the temperature of the insect, pre-
viously taken, and that of the atmosphere, will be much too great, and thereby appear
to indicate a higher temperature than what the body of the insect really possesses.
When the temperature is taken during a state of rest, the thermometer is placed
beneath, and as completely covered by the abdomen of the insect as possible, while
a second thermometer, which has been very carefully compared with the first, is
placed on the same Jeyel with and at a short distance from it to indicate the tem-
perature of the atmosphere. When the temperature of active volant insects is to be
taken, it is preferable to inclose them singly in a small phial, introducing them with
the forceps as before, and being particularly careful not to touch the phial with the
fingers. The degree of activity or quiescence of the insect must always be parti-
cularly noticed, and also the number of inspirations. By attending to these facts we
acquire a knowledge of the amount of respiration compared with the quantity of
heat evolved, as indicated by the thermometer. The temperature of the insect taken
on the exterior of the body is always a little lower than that of the interior ; but the
difference is not s0 great as might at first be imagined, s0 that I have generally pre-
ferred taking the exterior temperature, because the observations are then less com-
plicated by unnatural causes. The interior temperature is seldom if ever more than
a degree and a half, or at most two degrees above the exterior, and often not even
half a degree, when the insect is in a state of perfect rest. Perhaps it may be urged
as an objection, that when the bulb of the thermometer is applied to the exterior of
the body, it can seldom be s0 completely covered as to indicate the whole amount of
