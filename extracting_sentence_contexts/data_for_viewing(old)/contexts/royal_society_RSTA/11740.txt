sensibly true for all paramagnetic media at high temperatures: at lower tempera-
tures they gradually pass into the ferromagnetic condition. It is the magnetization,
so to speak, of an ideal perfect ferromagnetic, in which the controlling force that
resists the orientating action of the field is practically wholly derived from the
magnetic interaction of the neighbouring molecules, which for this purpose form
elastic systems, that is illustrated by Ewzne’s well-known model, which so clearly
represents the hysteresis accompanying ferromagnetic excitation. In ordinary
paramagnetic substances this mutual magnetic control of the molecules is insensible
compared with the control due to other molecular causes ; and our conclusion is that
these causes are such that the magnetic energy expended in working against them is
transformed into heat energy, not into internal energy of any regular elastic type.

But we have not taken account of the fact that the molecules of every substance
are subject to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic influence, of which one or the
other preponderates. The theoretical law should thus be «= — B+ AT™! or
«xl = A—BT; so that in a diagram of the relation between «IT and T each
substance would be represented by a straight line. In paramagnetics the line should
slope slightly down towards the axis: for diamagnetics it should pass not through
the zero of temperature but on the positive side of it. According to Curm, his
experimental results are equally well represented by this formula, on account of the
preponderant influence of the paramagnetism.

Similarly, should it turn out that for weakly electric media such as gases, (K—1)/p
is independent of the temperature, it would follow that the electric polarization is
mainly an affair of change of internal constitution of the molecules: while were the
