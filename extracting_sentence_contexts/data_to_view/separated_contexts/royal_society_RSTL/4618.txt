+50 (No. 15)(No. 16). In fact, writing a=b=e=f=0, and rejecting, where it occurs, a factor 2%, the several
covariants become functions of ca, dy; and putting, for shortness, &, y instead of ca, dy.
the equation to be verified is

1.10(z+y)(6a%+ 84% +282%*+ 8xy* + 637)
— 4.10(z+y)(8a*+2xy +39)
+50(6a*+8ay+ 64?) (a*+a% +297 +5) =0.
