These billiards could be seen as an instance of
local integrability; however, this regime is somehow complementary to the one usually considered
for Birkhoff conjecture. Here one has local integrability in a neighbourhood of an elliptic periodic
orbit of period 2 (leading to homotopically trivial invariant curves for the billiard map), while
Birkhoff conjecture is usually concerned with integrability in a neighbourhood of the boundary
of the billiard table. However, this fact—if verified—would provide an extremely interesting
indication that these two regimes of integrability do differ. Remark 4.5. Birkhoff conjecture can also be thought of as an analogue, in the case of billiards,
in the following task: classifying integrable (Riemannian) geodesic flows on T?.
