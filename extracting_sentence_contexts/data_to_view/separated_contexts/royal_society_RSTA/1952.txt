The history linking continuum and discrete aspects of the question at hand is convoluted and
interesting. In 1834 Russell observed solitary water waves [2]. Stokes proposed in 1847 that what
Russell had observed were in fact periodic wave trains in a nonlinear system [3]. Benjamin and
Feir demonstrated in 1967 that these Stokes waves could become unstable [4]. Lake et al. showed
in 1977 that under certain circumstances the so-called Benjamin-Feir instability may lead to a
Fermi—Pasta—Ulam—Tsingou-type recurrence [5].
