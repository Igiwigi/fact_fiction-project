'= great volcano called Tengger ; whereas in such volcanic cones as have been truncated
Sby explosions and subsidences, after considerable aqueous erosion, the rim is invariably
Sindented, as would be the case if the line c, d represented the margin of such a cavity.
S0n applying this test to Etna, I found that the crest of the sonuthern escarpment of the
EVal del Bove, between the Montagnuola and Zoccolaro, was, as a general rule, very
Zentire and unbroken, but that there were notches or abrupt depressions, several hundred
=S feet deep, precisely at the two points where the upper ends of the valleys called the Val
S dei Zappini and the Valle del Tripodo (sce Map, Plate L.) joined the crest. Ilence it
Eis natural to conclude that the valleys in question are of older date than the Val del
= Bove, and that their higher extremities were once prolonged towards the upper region

of the cone, and were cut off when the Caldera was formed. Such an explanation,
however, of the facts would be fatal to any theory which refers to a single catastrophe,
or to any one mode of operation, whether slow or sudden, the upheaval of Etna, the
tilting of the inclined beds, and the opening of the great cavity called the Val del Bove.
The dividing © col”” which parts the Valle del Tripodo, the largest of the two valleys
above mentioned, from the Val del Bove, deserves the attention of every lover of the
Picturesque, as well as of every geologist, though my guides assured me that in their
time they had never heard of its having been visited by any traveller. It may be
reached from Zafarana without fatigue by the aid of mules in one day, returning in the
evening. On one side of the narrow ridge, 6000 or 7000 feet above the sea, we look
