Each column of this matrix (7) gives a set of solutions of the equations

dx/dt = ux,

and since 2(w) =1 for t = ty, these 7 sets are linearly independent, so that (uv) may
be considered as a complete solution of the system. Part II. of the same paper discusses the form of the matrix Q(w) in the neighbour-
hood of a point at which the elements of the matrix u have poles of the first order,
or in the neighbourhood of which the integrals of the original equation are all
“regular.”

It is there shown that if ¢ = 0 be such a point, a matrix

can be found, in which all elements to the left of the diagonal are zero, in which
c= 0 unless 6;—6; is zero or a positive integer, such that Q(w) is of the form

G2(¢)Go™,

where G is a matrix whose elements are converging power series in ¢, and G, is the
value of G at t = ¢,. The form of ¢ is such as to put in evidence what are known as HAMBURGER’s sub-
groups of integrals associated with the fundamental equation of the singularity ; the
method is, in fact, a means of analysing the matrix Q(1) into a product of matrices,
of which one is expressible in finite terms and shows the nature of the point as a_
singularity of the solution. The object of the following investigation is to see how far, under what conditions,
and in what form, such an analysis can be effected for equations having poles of a
higher order than unity in the elements of the matrix w. Tt is known that if in the neighbourhood of infinity the equation is of the form
