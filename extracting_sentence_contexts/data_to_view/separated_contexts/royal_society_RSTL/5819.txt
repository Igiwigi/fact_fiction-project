But its position may be clearly ascertained by
Sthe position of the attached extremity, internally, of the ciliated tube. The confluence
of the peduncle of the testes and base of the ciliated tube is a fact of great homological
Syalue. It proves that the generative gland is an outgrowth from, and organically the
development of the & segmental organ.”
