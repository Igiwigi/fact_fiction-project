opposite ends of the nucleus, and their feeble degree of differentiation suggests that
they have arisen independently at these positions. Not unfrequently we have seen
one large centrosphere at one end of the nucleus, whilst as yet none exists at the
other. These cases are very striking, for the nucleus may assume a peg-top shape,
the centrosphere being found at the attenuated end. In other cases, we find two
centrosomes, but these are separated by an interval of less than 180Â°. The hypo-
thesis that they have in these cases arisen by the fission and subsequent divarication
of the halves of a single parent, is very tempting ; but we do not believe that they
have really been formed in this manner, since no sort of definite relation could be
made out between the degree of their development and their distance from one
another.

But another fact can be urged against the attempt to derive the two centrospheres
from a common ancestor, namely, that in the earlier stages they are so often very
unequal in size. It is sometimes possible to trace at one end of the nucleus a large
and well-developed system of radiations, whilst at the other end there may as yet
scarcely exist any at all, and the impression produced on the mind of the observer is
that they are just arising at the latter spot. A disparity in size has been also
observed in the centrosomes and radiations in some animal tissues by ReINKE
and others.t

We have so far spoken of the centrosphere, meaning by the term a series of
radiations converging towards a common centre, but within this central mass minute
granules may often be detected. SrraspurceR regards them as representing centro-
somes, and we quite admit the tenability of this view. At the same time we do not
