From these quotations it appears that Wotrr, though thoroughly
ed with the parts of the flower, did not distinguish sporangia as a separate
y, but as modifications of leaves or parts of leaves. 3 same was essentially Goxrrir’s view, arrived at by a distinct course of
sing. Gorrurt (1790) at the outset drew attention to the fact that certain
or parts of plants sometimes “change and pass into the form of adjacent parts
wholly or in greater or less degree.” Of this change or “ metamorphosis ” he
nishes three kinds, regular, irregular, and occasional; the third, since it
s only monstrous developments, may be at once dismissed. Under regular
mea" sive metamorphosis GorTHE included the changes involved in the develop-
1F of the individual; the series, cotyledons, foliage leaves, bracts, and floral
3s in an annual plant serve as an illustration.
