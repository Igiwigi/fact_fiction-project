which they were made, they were found to range perfectly well together, so that one
and the same interpolating curve passed naturally and easily through either $eries, or
through both.

83, I first sketched by the eye, and without respect to any theory, a curve which
appeared to satisfy the observations of the 25th of September, which curve, it is to
be observed, was to give the law of extinction of heat in the atmosphere, and by its
arbitrary prolongation, to assign the solar intensity beyond the atmosphere, and the
absorption due to a vertical transmission.

Secr. VI. â€”Concerning the Law of Extinction.

84. Many familiar facts connected with the extinction of heat and light in passing
through media, some of which have been adverted to in the earlier part of this paper,
render it yery unlikely that the part of the solar rays which affects the actinometer
Should suffer a uniform relative loss in the snccessive strata of air. Perhaps no
medium whatever merely extinguishes light without colouring it, and if it colours it,
the light, being first deprived of those portions or rays for which the medinm in
question is comparatively opake, will be more and more freely transmitted through
Similar snecessive obstacles. We have seen (Art. 13.) how Lamserr established the
law of the progressively-increasing diathermancy of successive plates of glass, a re-
Sult confirmed by Ds La Rocks and MELLoxt: and as we have found that, notwith-
Standing the rarity of the atmosphere, its resistance to the passage of even the solar
rays is considerable, it is a most probable thing that a similar law should hold in that
case. A very slight inspection indeed of Curve XV. shows that it rises much faster
