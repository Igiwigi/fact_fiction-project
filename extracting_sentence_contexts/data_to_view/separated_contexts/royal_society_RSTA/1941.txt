These
have already been shown to be 1S—1p.3; (b) shows these two lines, and in addition
nine other lines (one is not visible in the reproduction on account of its low intensity). These are precisely the nine lines of the multiplet just described ; the strong arc lines
not belonging to this multiplet are not present at this middle stage of temperature. Hence the preceding facts may be summarised as follows: At the lowest temperature
two lines appear, namely 1S—1p,,,; at the intermediate temperature the nine lines

of this multiplet appear, while the lines 1S—1p,.., begin to fall off in intensity in
comparison ; at the highest temperature the lines of the multiplet are strong, but many
other strong lines are also present, and the lines 1S —1p,_, have lost much of their intensity. When the previously mentioned work of K1nc came to hand these results were compared
with those given by the electric furnace.
