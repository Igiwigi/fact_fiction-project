In the depth of the monsoon, near
Mangalore, in 1839, the water was observed to be nearly fresh a mile off the coast ;
and I have seen the Mediterranean discolcured by the turbid inundation of the Nile
to a distance of nearly forty miles from the Damietta embouchure. Mean Temperature in India.—Colonel SykEs, in his statistics of the Deccan, has
already noted one remarkable feature touching the mean temperature of places at
elevations on the table-land of India, namely, that it is much higher than the mean
for the same places, calculated agreeably to MavzR's formula. To the instances he
has cited of this fact, of places on the plateau of the Deccan, may be added the fol-
lowing, occurring on the table-Jand of South India.

Among the principal causes of this differential height of temperature,—a difference
more remarkable when compared with the indications afforded by the improved for-
mulze of Bagwsrer, D'AuBuis80xN and ATrix80N,—may be enumerated the physical
aspect and extent of the elevated plains on which these places stand,—the rapidity
with which the drainage water passes off, and consequent little evaporation,—the
comparatively flat, or gently undulating surface,—its bareness of vegetation during
great part of the year, —the non-influence of alternations of land and sea breezes, by
which places near the sea are cooled, —the partial influence of the monsoon and
scantiness of rain,—the favourable conditions of the atmosphere for irradiation, and
the capacity of the soil for imbibing and giving out the solar heat. The temperature
of the granitic soil in the vicinity of Bellary, at 2».., in May, reached 121*; that of
the R6gur, or black soil, 122*5 : the temperature of the air in the shade, 95*5 : at
midnight the temperature of the black soil was still 80 bigh as 86?; temperature of the
