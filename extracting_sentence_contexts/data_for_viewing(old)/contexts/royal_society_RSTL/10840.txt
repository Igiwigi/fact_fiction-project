'= The figures show that the wire of this experiment, although less susceptible than
Â£ the last to low values of the magnetising force, took a greater magnetisation with high
2 values of the force. But the most notable feature of this experiment is the enor-
S mously great amount of residual magnetizm which this wire retained when the
; magnetising force was completely withdrawn. On the poxsitive side the residual was
92 per cent. of the induced magnetism, and on the negative side 92-5 per cent. Its
R absolute value is very remarkable. B=14,500 (the residual value) corresponds to an
intensity of magnetism (J) of 1150 c.g.s. units of moment per unit of volume. Greab
as this is, ib was even slightly exceeded in another experiment with the same wire, in
which 93 per cent. of the induced magnetism remained after the magnetising force
was removed, giving a residual intensity of 1200 e.g.s. units of moment per unit of
volume. $0 far as T am aware no steel magnet ever holds 80 much magnetism as this.
: In fact, if by retentiveness we mean simply the faculty of remaining magnetic when
magnetising force is removed, and in the absence of mechanical or other disturbance,
| Soft iron is far more retentive than either hard iron or steel.
