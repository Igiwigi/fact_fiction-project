Their observation requires
a vacuum spectrograph, which we did not have at that time. OBSERVATIONS

Down to the limit of transmission of air, the spectra of the arc and spark were photo-
graphed with the 21 ft. grating, and the wave-lengths were measured against iron
standards. It was found necessary to use graphite electrodes for the arc, because of the
fact that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to run an arc between pure platinum rods. One is much more apt to get a glow discharge in which the cathode is hot, the anode
cold and the spectrum that of air. In the Schumann region also, arc-spark observations
were the chief source of the data.
