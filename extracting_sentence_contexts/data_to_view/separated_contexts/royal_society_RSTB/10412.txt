When Charles Darwin wrote these words, almost 150 years ago, our under-
standing of the nervous systems of animals was rudimentary. In fact, neurons
had only been discovered a mere 34 years earlier—by the great Czech anatomist
Jan Evangelista Purkinje. Yet by 1871, when Darwin wrote The Descent of Man,
it was already accepted that a larger brain relative to body size is likely con-
nected to higher mental capacities, a line of reasoning that Darwin also
accepted. So his insight concerning the brains of ants was truly visionary, argu-
ably the first recognition that the sheer mass of a nervous tissue is not the sole
arbiter of behavioural or cognitive performance (as the remarkable higher cog-
nitive abilities of ‘small-brained’ birds such as corvids are now confirming).
