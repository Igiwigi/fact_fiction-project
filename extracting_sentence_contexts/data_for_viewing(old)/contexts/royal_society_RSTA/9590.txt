of state. This deduction leads to a reasonable value.

It has been shown by Brecqueret, Broa, and later by Cuauprer,t ‘that the
magnetic rotatory power of the liquid and vapour states is not generally the same, and
it is reasonable to suppose that a similar but more pronounced effect will be found in
the passage from the liquid to the crystalline state, but the phenomenon will usually
be complicated in the latter case owing to the appearance of double refraction. The
researches of Gouy} and Cuauvry§ show that in the case of Iceland spar the effects of
double refraction and magnetic rotation are simply superposed. Now CHAUDIER|| has
established that the magnetic rotatory power disappears completely during the
crystallization of aniline, benzene, and nitrobenzene (all of which have been investigated
in Part I.). If this is a true discontinuity of the magnetic rotatory power, apart from
any effect due to double refraction, then we can use this fact to obtain an estimate of
