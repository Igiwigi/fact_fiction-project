Figure 7. Divergence time estimates for the placental radiation under TED. Results are shown for the rapid diversification model, but results are similar for other
informative priors on the diversification process (figures 5 and 6). The estimated age for placentals (crown eutherians) is around 86 Ma, younger than in most
molecular-clock analyses but still a considerable distance from the post-K—Pg-boundary estimate favoured by some palaeontologists. Note that the crown
groups of most placental orders postdate the K—Pg boundary, consistent with the fossil record. (Online version in colour.)
