J. HOPKINSON ON THE RESIDUAL CHARGE OF THE LEYDEN JAR.

are constants for the material, and A and B are constants dependent on the state of the
dielectric previous to insulation. It shonld be remarked that > does not depend alone
on the conductivity and specific inductive capacity, as ordinarily determined, of the
material, but also on the constants counecting polarization with electric force. Indeed if
the above view really represent the facts, the conductivity of a dielectric determined
from the steady flow of electricity through it measured by the galvanometer will differ
from that determined by the rate of loss of charge of the condenser when insulated. 2. A Florence flask nearly 4 inches in diameter was carefully cleansed, filled with
strong sulphuric acid, and immersed in water to the shoulder.
