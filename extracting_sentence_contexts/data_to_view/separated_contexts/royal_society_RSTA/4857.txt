The linear
dependence S,(t) ~ t1, where H = const, is observed only in a limited range of scales (less than
0.1 s): dependence Â¢(q) is obviously nonlinear. For intermittent turbulence in the usual fluid [64], it was found that the log-log plot of
structure functions S,(/) versus S)(/) (moments of different order) lies on a straight line in a
range which is much wider than the log-log plot of S,(/) versus / itself. This empirical fact was
called extended self-similarity (ESS). Such behaviour of generalized self-similarity holds even at
moderate Reynolds numbers over the range which is substantially longer than the inertial one. The extended self-similarity corresponds to the scaling in a turbulent cascade not with respect to
the usual distance, but with respect to an effective scale defined by the third order moment of the
velocity field.
