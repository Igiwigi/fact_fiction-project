means of its ciliate lining, then contracting sharply, and passing on its contents to the
left gastric chamber. Hence the food passes by a slow circular moyement into the
adjacent right gastric chamber, and thence to the rectum. As yet, however, there is

Loligo does develop as an open pit, which becomes closed in, and it corresponds in position with the shell-
gland, the existence of which T haye now demonstrated in Pisidium, Aplysia, Pleurobranchidium, Neritina,
Linneus, and Paludina, M. Hezxaxx For, has, subsequently to the publication of my firs} observations on
this matter (which were made in 1871 and 1872), observed the structure which I term the © shell-gland ” in
certain Pteropod embryos. Although there is a correspondence between the pen-sac of Cephalopods and the
shell-gland of other mollusks, I haye, in the Quart. Journ, Microsc. Science, Oct. 1874, adduced reasons
(based on palzontological facts) for considering them not to be identical structures. See als the same Journal
for January 1875.

The mantle (mn) originates simply as a continuation of the rim of the pharynx, carried
along each side of the foot, as is well scen in fig. 35.

Plate 3. fig. 35 @ gives in a diagrammatic way a view of the border of the pharynx
