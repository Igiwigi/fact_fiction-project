The first curye
will be the skew cubic, that is m=3; the s8econd curve may be any plane section of the
scroll; such a section will be a quartic curve having three nodes, one at each intersection
of its plane with the skew cubic. Conversely, if we have a skey cubic, and a plane
quartic meeting the skey cubic in three points, each of them a node on the quartic, then
the scroll generated by the lines which meet the skeyy cubic twice and the quartic once
will be a quartic scroll. In fact (se First Memoir, No. 10, and Second Memoir, No, 5)
the order of the scroll is given by the formula S(nz?, n)=n([m]+M)—reduction,
=16—reduction. And in the present case the reduction arises (Second Memoir, No. 4)
from the cones having their vertices at the intersections of the skew cubic and the
quartic, and passing through the skew cubic. Each cone is of the order 2, and each
intersection qu@ double point on the quartic gives a reduction 2X order of cone, =4;
that is, the reduction arising from the three intersections is =12; or the order of the
scroll is 16—12, =4,

63.
