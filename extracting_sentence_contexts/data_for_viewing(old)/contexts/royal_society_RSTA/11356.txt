kept well to the side of the enclosure. The enclosure was always used with its axis
vertical. This arrangement forms the simplest geometrical disposition of the surfaces
of the radiator and enclosure that can be used with the method adopted, as for
obvious reasons a sphere enclosed in a sphere is out of the question.

A suflicient length was left between the point of contact of the lower potential
lead and the terminal of the radiating wire, for the wire to acquire a constant
temperature.

As pointed out by Dr. J. T. Borromiry, the low thermal conductivity of glass is
a very serious objection to its use as an enclosure in experiments on emissivity, it
being possible for the inner surface to rise to a temperature very appreciably above
that of the water circulation. Owing to this fact, it was not thought advisable to
take any observations with the radiator at much less than 100Â° above the enclosure.
At temperatures higher than this a slight error in the estimation of the temperature
of the enclosure would not alter the results,

A large number of experiments were made, but only the most typical results have
been recorded here. The observations are given in the tables according to the order
in which they were taken, In Table [Ta will be found an illustration of the way in
which all the results were worked out.
