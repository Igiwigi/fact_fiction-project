Moreover, premise circular arguments are always dialectically
ineffective in that they cannot be deployed to rationally convince an opponent of the truth of
their conclusion. If Hume had shown that any inductive justification of induction were premise
circular, then there would be a serious problem. However, so the counter-argument goes, in fact
the justification of induction is properly thought of as ‘rule circular’ rather than premise circular,
and rule circularity is not always vicious. Rule circularity arises when one employs an argument
to establish a proposition concerning a rule, such as its reliability, and the relevant argument-form
towards the proposition is an instance of that same rule. An argument for the reliability of a given
tule that essentially relies on the rule as an inferential principle is not viciously circular, provided
that the use of the rule does not guarantee a positive conclusion about the rule’s reliability.
