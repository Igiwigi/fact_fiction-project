Disulphetholate of Lead
is very soluble in water. When evaporated over sulphuric acid, the salt yields fine
prisms or minute quadrangular laminze. When hastily evaporated it produces a
tough gummy mass.
Sulphopropionic Acid.

As might have been anticipated from the results obtained in the methyl-series,
disulphetholic acid is by no means the sole product of the action of sulphuric acid

upon propionamide and propionitrile. The formation of this acid is preceded, by that

of another acid richer in carbon and poorer in sulphur, in one word, by that of sulpho-
propionic acid. The uncrystallizable ammonium-salt, already mentioned, is in fact
the sulphopropionate of ammonium. Absolute alcohol throws it down from its

until entirely decomposed, and the filtered liquid concentrated in a beaker. At a
particular point of the evaporation, a quantity of s{phopropionate of barium appeared
in small cubic grains, which caused 80 much * bumping‚Äù as to make it necessary to
