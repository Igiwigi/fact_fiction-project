The head is still
unequally convex on its two sides, but the annulus is nearly vertical, and runs
directly downwards to the stalk; there it stops short on either side of the
insertion of the head upon the stalk (figs. 91, a, b, ec). Ido not find even that near
relation of the two ends of the annulus to one another, across the stalk which is seen,
for instance, in Dennstaedtia ; in fact, the annulus is of the type characteristic of the
Polypodiacez, while the sorus is characteristic of the Cyathez. The spores are large, and the number produced from each normal sporangium is, in
O. struthiopteris, between 48 and 64. * Flora,â€™ 1895, p. 341.
