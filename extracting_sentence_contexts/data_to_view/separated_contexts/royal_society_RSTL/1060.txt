This nerve does not exist except where there is some
consent of motions established betwixt the face and the re-
spiratory organs. In fishes, this nerve, instead of being
distributed forward to the face, passes backward to the mus-
cles of the gills. In fact, there is, properly, no portio dura
of the seventh in fishes, the nerve resembling it being a
branch of the par vagum. A $hort description of this nerve
in the human body will be necessary to our enquiry. The respiratory nerve of the face arises from the superior
and lateral part of the, medulla oblongata, close to the nodus
cerebri, and exactly where the cus cerebell; joins the medulla
oblongata.
