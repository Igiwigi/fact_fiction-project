formation of chlornaphtaline. I thought it, however, of snfficient importance to ascer-
tain whether nitrate of.diazonaphtol would split up according to the equation

C,, Hg N,, NHO,+Hy O=C,, H, O+N,+NHO,,
since the poxsibility of obtaining the long-sought-for naphtyl-alcohol presented itself.
On boiling the s0lution of the nitrate of diazonaphtol, an immediate evolution of gas
takes place, and a viscid violet-brown mass separates which remains on the filter when
the solution is filtered hot.

The filtrate deposits generally small white plates, retaining, however, a portion of
the substance dissolved, which can be recovered by shaking the aqueous solution with
ether. On evaporating the ether it remains behind as a violet-coloured oil which
quickly solidifies. This latter, as well as the plates first deposited, is in fact almost
pure naphtyl-alcohol, whilst the violet-brown mass on the filter contains, besides naphtyl-
alcohol, a considerable quantity of a reddish-brown body. In order to purify the
naphtyl-alcohol, the united portions are treated with a cold solution of potassa, the
residuary brown-red body *Â® is filtered off, and the filtrate treated with acetic acid as
long as precipitation ensues. N aphtyl-alcohol separates first as an oil, 80on solidifying
to anetwork of small plates, which are still 8omewhat violet-coloured. They are thrown
on a filter, washed with cold water (which removes the mother-liquor), and then submitted
to distillation.

* This body is soluble in alcohol, to which it imparts a blood-red colour. On concentrating the alcoholic

slution, reddish-brown indistinet crystals are deposited, which, on rubbing, acquire a green metallic lustre,
