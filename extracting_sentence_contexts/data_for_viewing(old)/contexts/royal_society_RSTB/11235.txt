the situations are actually safe (i.e. inhibitory associations/
fear extinction), thereby contributing to the persistence of
anxiety disorders. For these reasons, exposure treatments are
designed to approach situations that have been avoided.
Albeit often underappreciated, return of fear is problematic
only when accompanied by escape or avoidance behaviours.
In the absence of escape or avoidance, return of fear would
be followed by additional extinction and eventual fear
reduction. As return of fear alone is a transient state, encour-
agement to tolerate fear throughout exposure sessions is
particularly beneficial (see Stimulus variability and Optimizing
inhibitory regulation during exposure therapy, sections 2f(i)
and 2g). In fact, the success of an exposure treatment may be
measured most accurately by the increase in approach than
by the decrease in fear. In support, higher avoidance at pre-
treatment (and not higher fear) predicts poorer response to
exposure-based treatments [73].

It is of utmost importance to extend research on fear extinc-
tion to include avoidance behaviours. Avoidance learning can
be modelled in the laboratory by adding instrumental control
to the Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure. A rodent may
avoid being shocked when it runs to another compartment of
the cage upon presentations of a predictive CS+. Likewise, a
human volunteer may avoid an aversive shock to the fingers
