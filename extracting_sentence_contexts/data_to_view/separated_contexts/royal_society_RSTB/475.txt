Absorption of Atmospheric Oxygen.—Although this organism grows well in enti
absence of oxygen, yet the fact that rapid liquefaction of the gelatine surface expos
to air takes place, seems to indicate that oxygen plays an important part in s
liquefaction, and this is found to be so on making the experiment in air in a s
flask. A larger absorption of oxygen was found to take place in the case where gelati
was used than where broth alone was used. After seven days’ incubation
atmosphere was composed as follows :—
