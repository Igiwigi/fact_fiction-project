of the lower limb obtained by stimulating the 5th, 6th, or 7th anterior lumbar root
in the dog and the slower, yet marked, flexion at all joints obtained by stimulating
the 5th, 6th, or 7th posterior lumbar roots in the dog is not obtained. In the
monkey, results obtained by stimulating the anterior roots are complex, extension of
some joints and flexion of cthers in varying degrees, both quantitative and qualita-
tive, according to the root stimulated, being observed, and there is not the invariable
extension characteristic of the dog.

The movements produced by stimulating the posterior roots are, of course, resultant
effects, but with the exception of an occasional slight extension of the ankle or knee,
according to the root stimulated, the main effect is that the bulk of the movement
produced is that of flexion, in this case agreeing with that observed in the dog.
Another interesting fact noted in the monkey was that, whereas by direct stimulation
only the 3rd lumbar to the 1st sacral anterior root inclusive produces movement in
the lower limb (RussEuL, and the present experiments), direct stimulation of the
posterior roots from the 12th dorsal to the 2nd sacral inclusive produced movement
in the lower limb. From the latter fact it follows that the path for the sensori-motor
reflex impulses in the cord must be both upwards and downwards, but this does not,
of course, negative the general truth of the conclusion drawn from the experiments
on the dog, namely, that for reasons (see above and below) the bulk of the impulses
pass downwards.

A point arose in one experiment, which may seem to explain in part, or entirely,
the ditference in results obtained by previous observers, and notably that of
SHERRINGTON and RussELt,
