In the elementary consideration of the simple gamma function it was found
to be necessary to rely on two algebraical limit theorems :—

(1) Evxer’s theorem ie a 2 a teas log n] = y.

(2) Srirtoe’s theorem dil pas sp | = of 2m.

In an analogous treatment of the double gamma function we may expect that
similar limit theorems will be required. This, in fact, is the case; but for our
present purpose it is sufficient to take particular cases of the asymptotic expansion
for log T(z). To make use of this approximation we need only remember that (“Theory of the
Gamma Function,” § 39) if z and @ be any finite complex quantities, and 7 a positive
integer,

log Tl (2 + mo) = log [2 + (x + 1)o|@] — log T, (|).
