SThe instances in which the remains of man or of his works have been found in caves
IF association with the remains of extinct Mammalia are many. They were duly
wticed by ScHMERLING in Belgium, by TouRSAL and others in the South of France, by
Tr. BUckLAaND in Wales, and by Mr. MOExEtsy and the Natural-History Society of 'Torquay
ix Kent's Hole; but in all these cases they were either explained away, in many
igstances by the observers themselves, from a preconceived improbability or rather im-

sSIbility of the circumstance, or the facts were refused credence on the same grounds

Kd the evidence negatived, as in the case of Kent's Hole, without investigation. At
{Sis time it is not necessary to contend for the correctness of many of those observations ;
tSey are too numerous and too well attested to admit of doubt, and are now generally
Fcepted ; at, the same time it is to be observed that the discovery and early reports
of Brixham Caye had a very important influence in bringing about such a result.
The discoveries of SCHMERLING and others had dropped into oblivion, the assertions of
M. Bovcnes Ds PErTHes were ignored, until the certainty of the facts established by
the exploration of Brixham Cave showed the strong primd4 facie evidence of the con-
temporaneity of man and of the great extinct Mammalia. Fresh from this new ground,
and strong with convictions acquired on other grounds, Dr. FALCOXER visited the valley
