expressive of the law of human mortality, &c. 519

This equation between the number of the living, and the
age, becomes deserving of attention, not in consequence of its
hypothetical deduction, which in fact is congruous with many
natural effects, as for instance, the exhaustions of the receiver
of an air pump by strokes repeated at equal intervals of time,
but it is deserving of attention, because it appears corrobo-
rated during a long portion of life by experience; as I derive
the same equation from various published tables of mortality
during a long period of man's life, which experience: there-
fore proves that the hypothesis approximates to the law of
mortality during the same portion of life ; and in fact the
hypothesis itself was derived from an analysis of the expe-
rience here alluded to.

Art. 6. But previously to the interpolating the law of mor-
tality from tables of experience, I will premise that if,
according to our notation, the number of living at the age z
be denoted by L,, and x be the characteristic of a logarithm,
or such that x (L,) may denote the logarithm of that number,
that if a (L,)—a(L, , ,)=m, a(L, ,,)—A(Li+ 2) =P,
a(L,-) —AL+ EG kaag? þ; and generally a (L,,——3)—
a(Lu pu) =m- þ*"* ; that by continual addition we shall
