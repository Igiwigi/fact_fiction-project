be surveyed, all cases known to have been investigated have been collected together and are
listed either in table 10a or in table 104 according to whether the calculated cross-section is
greater or less than the theoretical upper limit. For some of the examples cited a brief
account has already been given of the wave functions employed in the computational work;
as regards the others, details need not be reported here, though it should perhaps be men-
tioned that the incident and scattered electrons were represented by distorted plane waves
in the case of atomic oxygen and by Coulomb waves in the case of the various ions.

It will be noticed that ifa transition connects levels of the same principal quantum number
it usually appears in table 10a,$ and conversely if it does not do so, it usually appears in
table 104; indeed, the only exceptions to the rule are He, 1 1S» 238, and H,, 'X;—> Xi (with
post interaction) and Hg, 6P, > 63P, (with prior interaction). Such a division is, of course,
only to be expected and is merely a manifestation of the fact that the cross-sections associated
with the former group are normally larger than those associated with the latter group;
conclusions cannot be drawn on the relative accuracy of the calculations for the two classes
of transition. The apparently anomalous cases are, however, of interest; for it is the very light
atom, helium, and molecule, hydrogen, that provide the exceptional transitions in table
10a, and it is the very heavy atom, mercury, that provides the exceptional transition in table

104. Once again there is the suggestion that the Oppenheimer approximation is worst
suited to light systems and best suited to heavy systems.

It is natural to inquire whether, if for a particular transition the Oppenheimer approxima-
tion yields a cross-section in excess of the limit, the true cross-section is actually only slightly
below the limit. The rather crude laboratory data on H,, 'Z,->%X, (Poole 1937) and on
