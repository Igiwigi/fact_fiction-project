It was principally in order to answer
this question that the micro-stimulation apparatus described in Part X was designed. (2) The chromatic aberration of the lens system of the human eye

The evidence for chromatic aberration in the lens system of the eye is of a very convincing
character. In the first place an examination of a frozen antero-posterior section through
the eyeball discloses the fact that there is no structure of the correct shape, except the
vitreous, to play the part of a negative lens composed of flint glass. Further, the refractive
index and dispersion power of this structure resemble those of water, as do those of the
cornea and the aqueous humour. In consequence, any neutralization of colour error which
it might produce would be very small in extent.
