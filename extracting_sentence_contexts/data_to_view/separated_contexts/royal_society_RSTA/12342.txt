The sensibility factor is very
far from being constant, varying from about 14 when the potential of the needle was
about 3000 volts to about 50 when it was about 300 volts; but nevertheless for each
potential of the needle with the constant distance between the quadrants, and between
the fibres, the sensibility has practically a perfectly constant aie The following
examples selected from Table II. illustrate this :-—

The small differences between the values of the sensibility factor on November 4,
and on the later dates for the same potential of the needle, arises probably from the
fact that in the interval the fibres were separated far apart at the top to enable the
next set of experiments to be made, and approached again on December 3, until

they were again, as far as the eye could judge, in the same position as on Novem-
ber 4. In changing the distance between the fibres, as well as in altering the
tension of the fibres to adjust in each case for minimum sensibility (corresponding
with equal tension) only one of the rollers on which the fibres are wound was touched,
in order that a position could be reproduced as nearly as possible. But it was, of
course, impossible to exactly reproduce a previous position of the fibres, and the
sensibility factor for a fixed potential of the needle, and for a so-called fixed position
of the fibres was, consequently, not absolutely constant.
