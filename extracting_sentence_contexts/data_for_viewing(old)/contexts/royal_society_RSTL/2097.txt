although I have not in every instance succeeded in this.

To have omitted to state in this paper the fact of such a

one which is strongly opposed to all the reasoning that it
contains. To abstain from giving any explanation, however
imperfect, that might reconcile it with my view of the sub-
ject, would be to leave untouched a very powerful, and almost
Solitary argument against the explanation which I have pro-

fore attempt to show, not merely that it is not repugnant to
the principle which I have already explained, but that that
very principle may, in certain circumstances, produce the
retrograde motion, and that in others nearly similar, it shall
not take place; thus not merely showing the possibility of the
