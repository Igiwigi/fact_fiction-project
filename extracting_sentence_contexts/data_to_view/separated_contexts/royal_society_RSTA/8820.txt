In other words the limits are the d (1)
sequents which form the satellites. Now it has been shown above that the abnormal
triplet separations which the D series exhibit is probably due to the fact that the d
sequent for a given satellite triplet is not the same for each of the three lines, but
that they are subject to a displacement of one or more ouns. For instance where », is
788 in place of 786 (in round numbers) the difference 2 is due to the fact that d,, is
not equal to d,, but is d,,(6,). If the strongest line is to be. taken as normal, we
should expect the d,,, or d,, to be normal rather than 'd,, as D,, is always weaker
than the other lines of a triplet satellite. In this case F, (0) =d,,(d,) and the
F separation = F,,(0)—F, (0) = d,,,(6,)—d,, which is less than the observed satellite
separation by about 2.
