species conservation were considered separately, and we were
not able to take into account potential shared costs for sympa-
trically occurring species [2]. In this analysis, we assumed the
costs of downlisting were related to the improvement of a
speciesâ€™ conservation status by no more than one IUCN

category. The available estimated costs were for at least one cat-
egory [2], so some species might be downlisted by more than
one IUCN category with the same expenditure. As a result, it
is possible that the ADEPD-cost scores of those species were
underestimated in this analysis. However, we consider it unli-
kely that the minimum funds necessary to downlist a species
once are in fact also sufficient to downlist it twice.

The cohort of 206 species used in this study was selected
from the analysis of global financial efforts for bird conserva-
tion in reference [2]. Data for the initial cohort of 210 species
selected in this study, from which the wider conservation
costs for all bird species were estimated, were obtained through
sending questionnaires to experts on all threatened birds. This
cohort therefore represents those species for which data were
received, and thus there is a further risk of geographical, taxo-
nomic and/or other biases in the data available for our study,
associated with variation in non-response from experts and/or
lack of knowledge on estimated costs of downlisting or expen-
