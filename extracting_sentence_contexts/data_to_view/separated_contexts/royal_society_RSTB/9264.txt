Later, the Chiorazzi laboratory [52] and independently
the Burrone group [53] found that the entire VH gene and
CDR3 junction were highly conserved between multiple
people with CLL. Restriction for the light chains encoding
the BCRs in CLL was also noted [54]. In fact, approximately
1% of CLL patients express essentially identical tumour-
associated immunoglobulins [55]. Another study found
restriction for VH4 genes, including the autoreactive VH4-
34 gene in CD5 + IgG + CLL B cells [56]. As described in
ยง5, VH4-34 is well known for encoding autoreactive BCRs
that bind to polylactosamine [42-44].
