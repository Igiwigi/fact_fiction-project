Moreover,
as mU(dW;//dt). It should be noted that the projection of the the fundamental source of energy in shear soaring is the vari-
time derivative of the wind onto h is not identical to the time ation in wind speed that the bird encounters as it passes
derivative of the projection of the wind onto h, which reflects through the shear layer [32]. Hence, while it is possible to use
the fact that a bird cannot harvest aerodynamically useful either formulation to solve for flight trajectories that result in
mechanical energy from a constant wind field merely by turn- no net change in mechanical energy over a period of cyclical

energy is obtained from a time-varying wind field. Because birdâ€™s movement relative to the air, not the ground.
