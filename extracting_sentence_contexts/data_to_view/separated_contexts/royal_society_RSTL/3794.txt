284 MR. NEWPORT ON THE REPRODUCTION OF LOST PARTS

series on Lepidopterous insects, the results of which I have now the honour to com-
municate to the Royal Society. Myriapoda. The facts already ascertained respecting the periodical development of new 8egments
to the body in this class, led me to anticipate a favourable result in experimenting
on the reproduction of the antennz and legs. In the spring of 1841, I had placed
about thirty nearly full-grown individuals of Tulis terrestris and Tulis niger in a
closed vessel filled with clay and mould. Many of these individuals deposited ova,
some of which I succeeded in rearing.
