consulted for additional details regarding experimental protocols.
(For additional methodological details regarding the expression
and purification of recombinant Hbs, see [29,41—43].) We restrict
the analysis to data based on standardized measurements of pur-
ified Hbs, so the observed variation in P59 values is purely
genetic, reflecting evolved changes in the amino acid sequences
of the a- and B-type subunits of the a8: Hb tetramer.
This focus on purified Hbs avoids problems associated with the
confounding effects of environmentally induced variation.

(c) Testing for convergence in haemoglobin function
In comparative analyses of phenotypic variation, it is important to
account for the fact that trait values from different species are not
