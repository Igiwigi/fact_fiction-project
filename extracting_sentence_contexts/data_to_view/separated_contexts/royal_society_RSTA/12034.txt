Finally, after this process has occurred
throughout the piece a third stage is entered on, when further stable deflections
through a small range bring about the completely “saturated” state. Hysteresis is
found whenever any of the molecules pass from one stable configuration to another
through a phase of instability, and this transition, being mechanically irreversible,
involves a dissipation of energy. It was shown that this conception of molecular
structure gave an explanation of very many known facts regarding the magnetic
quality of iron and steel, and that some of these may be effectively illustrated by
means of a model consisting of a group of small magnets pivotted like compass needles
on fixed centres, and placed near enough to one another to allow their mutual polar
forces to be strongly felt. Th further elucidation of this theory, we have made a number of experiments with
such a model. In some of them as many as 130 little magnets have been used.
