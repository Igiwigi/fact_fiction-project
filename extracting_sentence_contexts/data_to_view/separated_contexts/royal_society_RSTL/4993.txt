In every example given, with the exception of the first, the economical
value of the air-engine in question is greater than that of the steam-engine calculated
by Mr. RaxkixE in his paper on the Mechanical Action of Heat. In considering
the relative merits of the engines, we must not, however, lose 8ight of a most im-
portant fact discovered by RaxkxixNg and CLavus1vs, viz. that a portion of the heat

the Dynamical Theory of Heat,” recently read before the Royal Society, Edinburgh, gives 209 foot-pounds as
the duty of an absolutely perfect steam-engine, with a range of temperature between 30* and 140? Centigrade.
