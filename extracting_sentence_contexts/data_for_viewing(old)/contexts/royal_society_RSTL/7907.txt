21. Any two or more relations may be aggregated together into, and they are then
constituents of, a single aggregate relation ; viz..the aggregate relation is only satisfied
when all the constituent relations are satisfied. The aggregate relation implies each of
the constituent relations.

22. There is no meaning in aggregating a relation with itself; 8uch aggregation only
occurs accidentally when two relations aggregated together become one and the same
relation ; and the aggregate of a relation with itself is nothing else than the original
relation.

23. A onefold relation is not an aggregate, but is its own sole constituent ; a more
than onefold relation may always be considered as an aggregate of two or more consti-
tuent relations. The constituent relations determine, they in fact constitute, the aggre-
gate relation ; but the aggregate relation does not in any wise determine the constituent
relations. Any relation implied in a given relation may be considered as a constituent
of such given relation.

24. The aggregate of a 4-fold and a 7-fold relation is in general and at most a ({&+1)-
fold relation ; when it is a (#+0)fold relation, the constituent relations are independent,
but otherwise, viz. if the aggregate relation is, or has for factor, a less than (4+1)fold
equation, the constituent relations are dependent, or interconnected.
