Again, isolating the Doppler effect, we deal with the superposition of infinite
simple trains. We have already seen that the composite vibration will have a
materially altered amplitude and phase after a time equal to the reciprocal of the
range of frequency in the component trains. For MicHELson’s experiments it
happens that this time is again some 10° periods.


DOUBLE INTEGRALS TO OPTICAL PROBLEMS. 359

In the actual radiation the two causes coexist ; the joint effect is of the same order ;
the radiation will attain independence after every 10° periods. In accordance with
this fact, we have interterence up to path-difference of some 10° wave-lengths ; while
the width of the lines corresponds to a fraction 1/10° of the frequency of the light.

Effect of a Natural Light on a Vibration.

§ 63. We have already proved that the complete solution of

© $ Qxe + pre = f(t) = [.R cos (ut + y)du

is c= f i {(p® — 2) cos (ut + b) + 2eusin (ut + w)},

F(t) being such a function of time as can actually represent a natural radiation (see
footnote, page 336).
