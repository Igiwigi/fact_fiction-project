fibre diameter (cf. figure 8). Given that the fibre diameter is not considered in Budiansky’s theory,
the resistance of thick fibres against microbuckling could not be taken into account anyway [2]. In
addition, with increasing fibre alignment the compressive load ratio will decrease asymptotically
to a negligible value. Hence, the compressive load ratio would be underestimated.

In general, just a couple of publications could be found with experimental data! about
compressive strength as a function of void contents between vy = 0% and ~* 25%, as summarized
in figure 12. In combination with findings of failure initiation, as shown in figure 11 and presented
in [8], equation (3.2) leads to a minimum in compressive strength n ~ 50% for half-embedded
fibres. As observed in experimental studies for model composites at the micro- and meso-scale
levels, the failure initiation is caused by fibre-matrix debonding [32-34], which could be pushed

1 Owing to the fact that fibres were soaked in acetone before being saturated with resin to increase void contents, experimental
data of Hancox [31] are not considered.
