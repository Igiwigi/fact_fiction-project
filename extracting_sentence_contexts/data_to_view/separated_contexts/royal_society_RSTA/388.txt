One possibility is that the ice sheet models are
too lethargic for climates warmer than the Holocene. Hansen & Sato [60] point out the sudden
change in the responsiveness of the ice sheet model of Bintanja et al. [59] when the sea level reaches
today’s level (figs 3 and 4 of Hansen & Sato [60]) and they note that the empirical sea-level data
provide no evidence of such a sudden change. The explanation conceivably lies in the fact that
the models have many parameters and their operation includes use of ‘targets’ [46] that affect
the model results, because these choices might yield different results for warmer climates than
the results for colder climates. Because of the potential that model development choices might be
influenced by expectations of a ‘correct’ result, it is useful to have estimates independent of the
models based on alternative assumptions. Note that our approach also involves ‘targets’ based on expected behaviour, albeit simple
transparent ones.
