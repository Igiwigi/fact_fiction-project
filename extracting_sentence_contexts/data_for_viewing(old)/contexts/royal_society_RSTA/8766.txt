series, it is not difficult to show that the vanishing of 4026 on VIII. is to be
expected. For on the basis of 10 for the photographic intensity of \5876, the
average value for \4026 is 3°0. The actual photographic intensity of 45876 on VITI.
is, from a preceding table (Table III.) 2°67. That of \4026 should therefore be, on

this scale,
2°67 x 3°0/10 = 0°80.

Accordingly, for this line, if h, be its height,
10%" = 0°80

which is less than unity, and therefore A is negative. This signifies that the
exposure is insufficient to show the line even on theoretical grounds. In fact, on the
scale in Tables III. and IV. the minimum photographic intensity which can be visible
is not zero but unity. This particular scale, according to the definition of


150 DR. T. R. MERTON AND PROF. J. W. NICHOLSON ON

photographic intensity adopted is the true scale, and will be referred to as such in
later parts of this communication.

We may now consider Table VI. which shows that the Diffuse series of Parhelium
behaves in the present connection in a quite different manner. The arbitrary
intensity 10 is ascribed to 46678 in each case.
