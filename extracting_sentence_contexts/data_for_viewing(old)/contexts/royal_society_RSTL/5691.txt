than those found by nearly all of the earlier experimenters, are in accordance wi
the results lately made known by Bvee.

The wires of bismuth employed for these experiments were of a very small diameter
(0:144 millim. and 0-185 millim.); for when manipulating with thicker ones, very varying
results were obtained, probably owing to the disposition of the crystals, as MarrgvooÂ®
has already observed. In fact, twelve experiments made with such wires, when the con-
ducting power varied from 1:11 to 1:36, gave as a mean 1:20, which agrees pretty accu-
rately with the number in the above series.

Graphite No. 1 is the $0-called pure Ceylon, No. 3 the purified German, and No, 2
a mixture of both, all used for making pencils. 'The specimens were purified by Bnoviy's
patent, and pressed by Mr. CARTMELL, to whom I am indebted for the same. These, as
well as the gas-coke and BuxseN's battery-coke, were shaped into thin rods by hand,
and the ends coppered galvanoplastically.

To form the connexion in order to determine their conducting powers, one end stood
in a cup of quicksilyer, the other cup being formed by placing an india-rubber tubing
over the other end, the latter cup being of course also filled with quicksilver. As the
