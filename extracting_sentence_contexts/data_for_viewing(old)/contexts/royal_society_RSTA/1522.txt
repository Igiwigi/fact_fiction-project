of such enhanced sampling simulations show that there is a significant variance between the

expectation values computed from individual replicas [64]. 3
Indeed, ensemble-averaging is not just a practical consideration invoked in the repertoire of oS

uncertainty quantification methods. When molecular dynamics is used, as it frequently is, to
estimate thermodynamic properties, such as the free energy of a system, it should be recalled
that the connection between microstates (generated by individual MD simulation trajectories)
and thermodynamic properties is achieved using ensemble averages. This is true whether the
system is in or out of equilibrium. The very common resort to perform so-called ‘long-time
averages’ of a single microsystem appeals to the ergodic theorem, which is in fact only valid
for long times at which this time average should converge to the ensemble average. In reality, that
time interval would need to be of the order of a Poincaré recurrence time—a truly astronomical
epoch—for the equality to hold. In practice, it is taken to be as long as authors deem to be
reasonable, and, compounding this, we must face the fact, mentioned below, that the accuracy

of these long-duration trajectories is severely limited. : =
