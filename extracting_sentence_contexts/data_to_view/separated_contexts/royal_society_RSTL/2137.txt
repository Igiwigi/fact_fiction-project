Dx La Rocus and Bior appears to be nearly the same as
that of Professor LesLts (Inquiry, p. 162). And it certainly
has the merit of simplicity and satisfactory explanation of
the phenomena. But it is an opinion which has not received
direct proof; and it is also obvious, that the phenomena may

be explained without it ; for we may just as well account for
the facts, by supposing two distinct heating influences, one
associated' in some very close way with the rays of light,
carried as it were by them through a glass screen without
heating it; the other being merely simple radiant heat,
affected by the screen exactly as the radiant heat from a non-
luminous body.

(5.) In order to ascertain which of these suppositions is
true, it will not be sufficient to observe the effects produced
by the intervention of a screen alone. We must combine this
method with an examination of the relations of different sorts
of heat to surfaces. These relations have been shown to dif-
fer according as the body is luminous, or not ; in the one
case, the direct heat affects bodies in proportion to the dark-
ness of their colour, without regard to the texture of their
surface : in the other, the magnitude of the effect depends
solely on the absorptive texture without reference to colour.
