In all cases, pre-folded BamA accelerates the folding of the
client OMP. Although the BamA-enhanced initial rate
increased with increasing substrate concentration (figure 3),
these experiments could not definitively establish that BamA
behaved according to classic enzyme kinetics. In fact, if it
does function like that, the initial rate versus [substrate] plot
did not display the expected shape of a square hyperbola,
which implies that the K,, would be high. Such a finding
seems to indicate that any interactions between BamA and a
client uUOMP are thermodynamically quite weak. Because uOMP folding is minimally second order, it is also
worth considering how BamA may function to influence the
membrane conformation.
