Some of the sporangia
remain on the process, while others have been carried up by the elongation of the
insertion of the bud. Such a case may be compared with the production of two buds
on the summit of a process referred to above. In connection with the characters of subsporangial tissue, and of the cells near the
border line between sporophytic and prothallus tissue in the case of vegetative buds,
a fact of possible cytological interest may be recorded. In a number of these cells
two nuclei were found, although no indication of a recent division was apparent. They were sometimes close together, sometimes farther apart.
