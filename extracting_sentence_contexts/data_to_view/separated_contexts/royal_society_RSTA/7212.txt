It is easily seen that the combination of (248) and (249) is continuous across 4 -}- 4) = 7. For on this line @ = 7, and from (207)

The formula (252) is a generalization of (165), the two being obviously equivalent when

p.(siny) = 1. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The main object of this paper is to give an analytical treatment of a suitably simplified
problem which is fundamental in the theory of radio propagation over an inhomogeneous
earth, This purpose is achieved by establishing, with adequate rigour, formulae from which
any example could be largely worked out; furthermore, these formulae are simple enough,
at least in special cases, to demonstrate the general nature of the effects involved, and they
provide, in particular, a theoretical confirmation of the sufficiency of Millington’s method
in practical application.
