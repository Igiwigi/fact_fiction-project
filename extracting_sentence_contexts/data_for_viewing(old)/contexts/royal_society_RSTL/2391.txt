APPREHENDING that the Royal Society will favourably receive accounts
that have a direct tendency to determine the height of that interesting phazno-
menon, the Aurora borealis, I haye been induced to transmit some observyations
that were made upon a very Temarkable one, which appeared in the evening
of the 29th of March, 1826. From some recent observations, an opinion
seems to be entertained by some writers, that the aurora is not s0 high as has
generally been estimated ; but it is only from facts and observations such as
the following, I conceive, that any near approximation to the true height can
be obtained.

The aurora borealis above mentioned, was of a kind very rarely occurring.
It assumed the appearance of a rainbow-like arch, stretching across the mid-
heaven, at right angles to the magnetic meridian. It was subject to very little
change of position for an hour or more, and therefore afforded time to observe
the angle of its elevation above the horizon. In the period of five years'
observations at Kendal formerly, above one hundred appearances of the aurora
occurred to me, and only one of the kind just described. I had not an oppor-
tunity of seeing the one which is the subject of this paper, but it was seen here
(at Manchester) by a friend of mine about 9 o'clock on his returning home
