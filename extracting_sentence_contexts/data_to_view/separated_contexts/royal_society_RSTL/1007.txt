When two bodies repellent of each other act upon the same
body with different degrees of the same electrical attracting
energy, the combination would be determined by the degree ;
and the substance possessing the weakest energy would be
repelled ; and this principle would afford an expression of the
causes of elective affinity, and the decompositions produced
in consequence.

Or where the bodies having different degrees of the same
energy, with regard to the third body, had likewise different
energies with regard to each other, there might be such a
balance of attractive and repellent powers as to produce a
triple compound ; and by the extension of this reasoning,
complicated chemical union may be easily explained. Numerical illustrations of these notions might be made
without difficulty, and they might be applied to all cases of
chemical action ; but in the present state of the enquiry, a
great extension of this hypothetical part of the subject would
be premature. The general idea will, however, afford an easy explanation
of the influence of affinity by the masses of the acting sub-
stances, as elucidated by the experiments of M. BERTHOLLET ;
for the combined effect of many particles possessing a feeble
electrical energy, may be conceived equal or even superior to
the effect of a few particles possessing a strong electrical
energy : and the facts mentioned, page 25, confirm the sup-
position : for concentrated alkaline lixivia resist the transmis-
son of acids by electricity much more powerfully than weak
ones. Allowing combination to depend upon the balance of the
natural electrical energies of bodies, it is easy to conceive that

a measure may be found of the artificial energies, as to inten-
sity and quantity produced in the common electrical machine,
or the VoLTaic apparatus, capable of destroying this equili-
brium ; and such a measure would enable us to make a scale
of electrical powers corresponding to degrees of affinity. In the circuit of the VoLraic apparatus, completed by
metallic wires and water, the strength of the opposite electri-
cities diminish from the points of contact of the wires towards
the middle point in the water, which is necessarily neutral.
