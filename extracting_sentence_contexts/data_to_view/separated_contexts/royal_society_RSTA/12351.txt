The sine of the inclination of its tangent to the axis of y is $/y. Any gas
expanding or contracting under a constant pressure traces out a curve of this kind
with its varying density and vis viva. It is remarkable that if the points corresponding to the density and vis viva of a
vapour in contact with its generating liquid are laid down on this chart (fig. 3), they
range themselves in a straight line, such as TR, that issues from some point advanced
on the axis QC, As this fact applies to all vapours that have been experimented
upon, it seems to point to the true physical law of their equilibrium with the liquid. On the accompanying chart of vapours I have projected the points of several sets of
experiments. It may be viewed as a portion of the fig. 3 enlarged, the point Q,
or origin of co-ordinates, being about 40 inches to the left of the outer margin.
