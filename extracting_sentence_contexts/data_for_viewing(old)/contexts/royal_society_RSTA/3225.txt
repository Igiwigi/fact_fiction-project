with different velocities. In most realistic machines with optics parameters varying along
the circumference and in particular for ELENA [18,19], IBS leads to emittance blow-up in
all three phase spaces [19,20]. IBS is expected to determine, together and in equilibrium
with electron cooling, the parameters of the beams sent to the experiments.

— Direct space charge effects are caused by the Coulomb repulsion of an antiproton and
the rest of the bunch. The resulting effect is highly nonlinear with strong defocusing in
the centre of the beam. In ELENA, direct space charge effects are a limitation despite the
low intensity due to the low energy, the small transverse emittances and the short bunch
lengths required by the experiments. The initial motivation to split the available intensity
in one machine cycle into four bunches, which can be sent to four different experiments,
was a mitigation measure to reduce this direct space charge effect by about a factor of
4. The fact that four experiments can receive beam from the same cycle and, thus, be
operated in parallel is finally considered an advantage by the user community despite
the reduction in intensity per bunch.

— At very low energy, the beam is sensitive to perturbations such as magnetic stray fields
and imperfections (nonlinearities) of bending and quadrupole magnets, which become
more difficult to control at low magnetic field levels due to remanence effects. For


example, the Earth’s magnetic field leads to significant perturbations of the ‘closed orbit’
of up to 10 mm in the vertical plane. At the beginning of the project, it had been foreseen
to apply ‘dilution’, i.e. mixing of non-magnetic stainless steel laminations with magnetic
laminations, for the main bending magnets; this increases the magnetic flux density in
