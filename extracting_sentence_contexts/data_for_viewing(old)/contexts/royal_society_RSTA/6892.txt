Similarly, from the last pair of equations in (51), we have
/3+3f,; = 9 to the third order,

and therefore /, is also zero to the third order.
Hence in the equations (51) we may take £, and /, zero and

1 = —A cos ot— 3543 cos 3at. (55)

10. SOLUTION OF THE EQUATIONS TO THE FOURTH AND FIFTH ORDERS

We now substitute the approximations (51) into the terms of second or higher order in
(48) and (50) and retain terms as far as the fourth order. In doing this, it will be noted
that a considerable simplification arises from the fact that /,, 8, and f, are all of the fourth
order at least. We thus obtain

a =f, +8 PRB, a, =—f, +46 f,
dy = fy+463+3H— BARR, dy =—28,—B, hy -FB B+ Bh, (56)
a= by +263, a, = —3£,—8f, 63,

a= by +46, ay = —48,—$8,/}.


PART II. STATIONARY GRAVITY WAVES 265

From the first pair of equations it is found that the equation (52) is true to the fourth
