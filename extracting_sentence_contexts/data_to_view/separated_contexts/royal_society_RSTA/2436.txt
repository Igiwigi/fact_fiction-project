At the outset something of a suggestion might seem to be found in consideration
of the fact that, if the intrinsic equation of a curve in the z plane is y = F(s), the
vectorial element of are dz is the same as ds exp (ix) or ds exp {iF (s)}, where i as
usual represents ,/(—1). From this it appears that the transformation

dz = f’ (w) exp [iF {f(w)}] dw,

where F and fare functions having real values for all real values of their arguments,
makes the real axis in the w plane correspond to a curve in the z plane whose intrinsic
equation is x = F(s), the relation between w and s being s =f(w), where f is
an arbitrary function.
