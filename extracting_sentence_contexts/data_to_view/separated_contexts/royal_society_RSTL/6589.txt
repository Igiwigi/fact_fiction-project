It may be further remarked that in
the case of the wheat there is as yet little, but in that of the barley more obvious
indication of progressive decline in the annual yield. The meadow-land yielded nearly 40 1bs. of Nitrogen per acre, per annum, or aboye
one-half more than the exclusively Graminaceous crops, wheat and barley. The hetero-
geneous produce, meadow-hay, contained, however, a good deal of Trifolium, and other
Leguminous plants, intermixed with the Grasses. 'To this fact is to be attributed, at:
least in great part, its comparatively high amount of Nitrogen. It should be observed,
too, that the average is as yet taken over only four years. The Leguminous crop (beans) has given, over a period of twelve years, an average of
nearly 48 Ibs. of Nitrogen per acre, per annum.
