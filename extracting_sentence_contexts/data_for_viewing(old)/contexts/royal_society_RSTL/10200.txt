in my communication to the Royal Society, or in the translation of it which appeared shortly afterwards
in the * Centralblatt.” (© Ueber electrische Vorginge im Blatte der Dionea muscipula.” * Central-
blatt f. d. Med. Wissensch.,' 1873, No. 53.) If Profezxor Muxkx had considered the context, he would
have 8een that in my lecture T meant nothing more than that both motions are expressions of the
same elementary endowment of protoplasm—that of changing its form on excitation. I held then,
and hold now, that, as regards what happens in the living protoplasm, the mechanical effects of excitation
in the contractile parts of plants and animals are closely related. As to the mechanism by which the
changes of form of the excitable organs of plants are brought about, nothing was aid in my paper.
T took for granted the explanation usually given, founded on Briicks's experiments. I had not become
acquainted with the then recently-publizhed researches of Prerrer on the excitability of plants
(f Physiologische Untersnehungen,” yon Dr. W. Prerysr, Leipzig : 1873).

As regards the original experiments by which 1 demonstrated the fact that the leaf of Dionwa responds
to excitation by an electrical disturbance analogous to the excitatory variation of muscle, Professor MuxK's


8 PROFESSOR B. SANDERSON ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE

The researches of KUNKEL,* like those of MuxKk, have been directed to two
questions, viz. : to that of the differences of electric tension which present themselves
in the uninjured leaf, and to the electromotive phenomena which follow excitation in
the excitable organs of plants, As regards the firs question, he has found that in
leaves generally, when they are led off by non-polarizable electrodes in the usual way,
differences of tension present themselves, these being always of such a nature that if
one electrode is in contact with a vein, the other with the green surface between the
