Srgans. The integuments covering the roots of the feet are perfectly transparent.
IVithin the hollow of each foot a beautifully looped, extremely delicate, slender, mem-
ranous, ciliated tube (fig. 21, abc) may be discerned, corresponding in every essential
Darticular with the looped ciliated tube of Nerine.
E But what is of special interest in this case is, that the appended glandular yellowish
anass (e e) in the female, which spreads irregularly into the hollow bases of the cirri and
8etiferous feet, can be most distinctly traced into organic connexion with the ciliated
tube, and with that limb (a) of the loop, of which the vessels are most developed.
During the constant movement of the little worm while under examination, it may be
distinctly observed that the ova- or sperm-bearing mass moves in consfant connexion with
the ciliated tube. So exquisitely delicate is the entire apparatus. and s0 minute are the
ova, that it is quite impracticable to trace them in their passage from the © mass ” into
the tube. Since however this fact has been observed, beyond doubt, in other Annelids,
and since it is supported by the analogy of everything that is now clearly known with
* The dissections upon which rest the statements in the text, were made upon Punice gallica (MILNE-

Epwarns), Z. sanguinea, and ZE. Harrassii (M.-E.), which are common on the shores around Swansea.
