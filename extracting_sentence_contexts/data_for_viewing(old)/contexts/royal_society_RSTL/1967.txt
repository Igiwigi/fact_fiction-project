believe the devyelopement of acid is more easy than when the chloride of silver
is quite pure.

The foregoing experiments have given me the most perfect conviction that
my estimate of the constitution of hornsilver, deduced from the researches pub-
lished in my last Essay, is in no wise vitiated by the fact noticed by Dr. ProuT.
But in order, on a point of s0 much practical and theoretical interest, not to
omit any evidence which might elucidate the subject, I endeavoured to analyse
corrosive sublimate by directly ascertaining the quantity of mercury which it
contains. For this purpose a quantity of grain tin was oxidized by nitric
acid, and the resulting oxide, after being washed and ignited, was reduced by
charcoal. The pure tin, after being granulated and washed, was dissolved in
strong muriatic acid. The solution was colourless and transparent, and an
excess of acid was added to it. The reduction of the bichloride was thus
effected. A given weight of the compound was dissolved in a small quantity
of hot water acidulated with muriatic acid, and the protochloride of tin, like-
wise hot, was added in excess. A tube twelve inches long, surrounded by a
moist cloth, was then attached to the flask containing the mixture, and ebul-
