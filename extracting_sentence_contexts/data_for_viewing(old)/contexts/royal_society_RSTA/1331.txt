Dyk = Fijk — Fnye—1 (3.2)

be the k’th martingale difference associated with the martingale (Fy :k<n). The square
integrability of the W,,’s implies that Dj,,~Dj,; is integrable and

E[DiDny|Gj] = DingE [ELD nx Gel1Gj] = 0 (3.3)

for j <k, so that

EDyDinj = 0 (3.4)

for j #k and n> k,m >j. This orthogonality of Dy. and Dy, is a key property of such martingale
differences. As was discussed in the Introduction, the fact that such martingale structure is a
reasonable requirement to impose on forecasts has been noted previously [6-8,12].

4. Markov decision processes incorporating a static forecast

We now wish to build a tractable model under which (W;: 0 <k < t + 1) evolves over the decision
horizon, conditional on the forecasts (F,,\9 : 1 > 0) available at the outset of the decision interval.

To this end, let Ky £ o(Finsjjm :j € Z4+,m <n) denote the o-algebra associated with the forecasts
collected by time n, and note that Ky; Gn, the o-algebra associated with all the information
observed by the forecaster by time n. We now wish to construct an MDP formulation appropriate
to decision-making by the energy system manager when she has access to the information
available both in F, and Kg. In other words, her decision at time n must be F, V Ko adapted,
