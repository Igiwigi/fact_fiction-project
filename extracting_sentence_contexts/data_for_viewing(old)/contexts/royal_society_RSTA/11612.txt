functions of the positions of the spheres.
14. With regard to the forms of these coefficients, we observe that the quadratic
function in the index must always be positive, because the chance cannot become
a infinite for infinite values of the variables, vu. The condition for this is that the
determinant

< and all its coaxial minors, must be positive, and, therefore, every @ positive.

§ 15. Again b,, not being zero, expresses the fact that u, and u, are not independent.
= But it is also a fact that they are more likely to be of the same than of opposite
4 signs. Therefore, b,., and similarly every 6, must be negative or zero.

5 16. Evidently also the coefficients 6 must generally diminish in absolute magni-
tude as the distance between the spheres to which they relate increases, and
‘2 must become inappreciable at some distance, small compared with the dimensions of
@ our system, but possibly large compared with the diameter of a sphere. ‘The D’s
must be functions of the positions of the n spheres within V having this property.

a Again we may consider either a volume V containing n spheres, or a smaller
