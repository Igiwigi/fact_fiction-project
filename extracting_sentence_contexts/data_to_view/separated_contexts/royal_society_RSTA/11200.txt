If we assume that
the percentage of water had gone up from 0°72 per cent. to 1 per cent. during the
four months, then the density of dry palladium black would become 11°8. No
allowance, however, has been made for the fact that the palladium black contained
oxygen, which would also tend to lower the density. Since the knowledge of the density was only essential for the purpose of translating
the actual quantity of hydrogen occluded into the number of volumes of hydrogen
occluded by unit volume of palladium, we have thought it better, in view of the
above circumstances and of the fact that the determination of the density of a fine
powder like palladium black is not at all easy, to adopt, for comparative purposes,
the value 12°0 as the density of palladium in its three states of aggregation, viz.,
black, sponge, and foil. As the actual measurements are always given in addition,
this assumption ought not to give rise to any error, and is to a certain extent justified
by the fact that, under proper conditions, the number of volumes of hydrogen

occluded by unit volume of the different varieties of palladium remains practically
the same,
