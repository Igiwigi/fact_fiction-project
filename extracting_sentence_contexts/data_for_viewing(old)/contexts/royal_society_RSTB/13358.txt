Thus, if within-ejaculate competition is costly for the diploid
male, lineages that can silence this competition are expected
to outcompete lineages that do not [34,52,53]. However, the
efficiency of haploid selection allows alleles with deleterious
effects in the diploid organism to remain in a population
[54]. In fact, even alleles that are recessive lethal to the diploid
organism can increase in frequency if their effects are suffi-
ciently beneficial for within-ejaculate competition [55].
However, because these alleles are recessive lethal, they
cannot go to fixation and a stable polymorphism prevents
the population from reaching its fitness maximum [56].

expression (e.g. [31]), and that cytoplasmic bridges between
spermatids would essentially homogenize any potential
remaining differences [32]. The very fact that sperm are so
