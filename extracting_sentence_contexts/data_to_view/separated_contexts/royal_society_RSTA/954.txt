Similarly to such anomalously diffusing
systems, one can evaluate the amplitude of the Fourier mode after some time. From the auto-
correlation function of a Fourier mode, averaging over starting time f, for a fixed time lag ty — to,
one gets

Along such straight fronts at positions (x’, ag + vt’) and (x", ag + ot”), the values of G,(x’, ’) = : 8
G¢(x', a9 + vt’) and G,(x", ”) = G,(x", ap + vt”) correspond to a white noise of square amplitude :
