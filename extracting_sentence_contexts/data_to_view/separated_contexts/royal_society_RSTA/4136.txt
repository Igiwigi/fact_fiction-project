If
t/t, = 1°1 then n,/n,= 11° =1:15. Thus the number of ions is the same on the
two sides to within 15 per cent. The equality of the fogs on the two sides is, in fact, rather more exact than we
would expect ; for the positive ions, according to ZELENY, take 1°25 times as long as
the negative to travel a given distance. We would expect then (the strength of the
field on each side being the same) that, if equal numbers of positive and negative
ions were produced in a given time, the negative ions would be more quickly removed,
and a somewhat larger number of drops should have been produced in the half
containing mainly positive ions. The absence of any indication of this slight excess of positive ions is of the less
consequence for the present purpose, since it strengthens rather than weakens the
evidence against the view that a larger number of positive than of negative ions is
produced.
