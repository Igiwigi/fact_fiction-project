In an experiment that I made of electrifying a mixed solu-
tion of muriates of iron, of copper, of tin, and of cobalt, in a
positive vessel, distilled water being in a negative vessel, all
the four oxides passed along the asbestus, and into the ne-
gative tube, and a yellow metallic crust formed on the wire,
and the oxides arranged themselves in a mixed state round
the base of it. In another experiment, in which carbonate of copper was
diffused through water in a state of minute division, and a
negative wire placed in a small perforated cube of zeolite in the
water, green crystals collected round the cube ; the particles
not being capable of penetrating it. By a multiplication of such instances the electrical power
of transference may be easily conceived to apply to the ex-
planation of some of the principal and most mysterious facts
in geology. And by imagining a scale of feeble powers, it would be
easy to account for the association of the insoluble metallic
and earthy compounds, containing acids. Natural electricity has hitherto been little investigated,
