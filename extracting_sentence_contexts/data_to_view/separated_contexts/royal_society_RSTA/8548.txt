A. A. GRIFFITH ON THE PHENOMENA OF RUPTURE AND FLOW IN SOLIDS.

strength is, in fact, no greater than it would be, according to the theory, if the test
pieces contained cracks several thousand molecules long.

(5) It has been found possible to prepare rods and fibres of glass and fused quartz
which have a tenacity of about one million pounds per square inch (approximately
the theoretical strength) when tested in the ordinary way. The strength so observed
diminishes spontaneously, however, to a lower steady value, which it reaches a few
hours after the fibre has been prepared. This steady value depends on the diameter
of the fibre.
