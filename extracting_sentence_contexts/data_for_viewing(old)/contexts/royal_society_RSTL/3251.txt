explain why the incipient embryo which it incloses, is (as I have found it) generally
either uppermost or undermost when the oyum is viewed in a fluid medium. The
relations of the thick transparent membrane (*zona pellucida”) of the ovarian oyum
in stages subsequent to that which I have called the * fifth” (Plate VI. fig. 105.), and
the adhesion just described as taking place between this membrane and the membrane
entering into the formation of the amnion, may, perhaps, be considered as showing
the correctness of those who had conjectured the thick transparent membrane to be
analogous to the vitellary membrane in the oyum of the Bird (par. 174.).

The Embryo a Congeries of Vesicles.

209. The precise condition of the embryo has not been mentioned in the three last
stages; the fact being that its appearance undergoes such rapid changes, and is sub-
ject to such variation, that to have attempted to associate any particular condition of
it with that of the parts representing those stages, would have been quite fruitless,
and moreover calculated to mislead, Besides which, there are 80 many dark globules
mixed with the yesicles, of which the embryo is now composed, that it is extremely
difficult to ascertain what the condition of the Jatter really is ;—a difficulty augmented
by the tendency in many instances to a sinking in at that part where the embryo lies.
If however fig. 118. be compared with fig. 121 A., the following differences will be ob-
served, In the former, the central portion of the germ (bb!) presented globules of
extreme minuteness; in the latter it was a congeries of distinct vesicles, of which
moreover there were two states. Those most internal were smaller and appeared
nearly black ; while those of the outer set were more expanded, and paler in their
colour. The peripheral portion of the germ in fig. 121 A. (bb?) was seen with great
