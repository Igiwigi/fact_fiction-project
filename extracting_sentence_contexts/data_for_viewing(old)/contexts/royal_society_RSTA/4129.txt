microscale. Such nonlinear responses can be captured using the two-scale micromechanics model : =
recently developed by Zhang & Waas [41]. This two-scale micromechanics model is extended : =
to any number of matrix layers, in general, by Patel et al. [42], and is henceforth called the : a
N-layer concentric cylinder (NCYL) model. The implementation of this NCYL model for a fibre aes
tow in a multi-scale computational framework for H2.5DTCs is presented in §7a. In the present 22
NCYL model, the inner fibre core is surrounded by (N — 1) matrix layers. During the process a}
of damage evolution, the damage occurring in the discrete matrix layers is identified based on : =
the calculation of the strain and stress fields, whereas the undamaged matrix layers retain their : S
virgin properties. It is important to emphasize the fact here that, in the 2CYL model, the entire : gS

volume of matrix material was degraded by the same amount, as it is not possible to restrict
damage to a particular region of matrix volume. As a result, the model overpredicts the stiffness
and the nonlinear stress-strain response. This limitation is eliminated by the NCYL model and
the radius of the discrete damage zone can be controlled as an input variable to this model. The
homogenized elastic properties of the fibre tow (Ej, v{,, G{,, KS, and G§,) are functions of the
degraded properties of the damaged matrix layers and the virgin properties of the undamaged
matrix layers. This is very crucial for progressive damage analysis, which is based fully on an
analytical solution.

In the experiment, catastrophic failure modes are reported, including fibre tow breakage, tow
splitting and transverse cracking, resulting in a loss of load-carrying capability at the macroscale,
