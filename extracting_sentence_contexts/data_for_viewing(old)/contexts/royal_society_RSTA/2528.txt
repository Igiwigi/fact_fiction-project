Figure 4. The inner and the outer form of the Pasch axiom.

In fact, it was shown in [32, Th. 7, p. 355] that it is enough to require that L(def) holds in the
conclusion instead of Z(def), to obtain the same theory. There is, however, another form of the
Pasch axiom, called the inner form, which states that:

IP. (Vabcde)(3f)—-L(abc) A Z(abd) A Z(aec) > Z(bfc) \ Z(dfe).

The outer and inner forms of the Pasch axiom were introduced by Peano [33] as axiom XIII
and axiom XIV.

Now Veblen [32, Th. 13, p. 358]) has shown that IP can be derived from £ U {Z8, OP}, by using
OP three times. We can show that, in any proof of IP from £ U {Z8, OP}, the axiom OP must be
used at least three times. To this end, we Skolemize the axioms Z6, Z7, Z8, OP, and IP. They
become (here ag, 41,42 are three individual constants, and o, ,¢,1 are operation symbols)
