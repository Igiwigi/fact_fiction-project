and size of the filler particles. In general, it is reasonable to use the ratio of time given to particles
for structuring within fabrication process ty to structuring time ¢ (equation (2.7)) as an evaluation
criterion of the final microstructure of the composite. The time t, includes polymerization time
and can be taken in order of magnitude if its exact value is unknown. Such an assessment using
ranges of values seems to us to be the most objective, since the actual concentration of particles
in the composite is also unknown, and it may differ from the desired one. This is due to the fact
