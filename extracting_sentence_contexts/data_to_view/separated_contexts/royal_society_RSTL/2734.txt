On
this supposition we may 8uppose the time of transmission of the tide along its chan-
nel to be constant. Or we may suppose that the changes of the moon's force not
only affect the lagging of the original tide behind the equilibrium position, but als
affect the velocity of transmission to Liverpool. In either of these ways the circum-
stances of the tide may be hypothetically represented ; but it will, of course, be un-
derstood that we use such hypotheses at present only for the sake of connecting and
representing the facts,

9. The effect which changes in the moon's force produce upon the retroposition of
the tide in time, that is, on the value of « in the formulze (a.) and (b.), is more difficult
to determine with any precision. It is, however, manifest from the general course of
the quantities in the Tables, that « is greater as the moon's parallax is greater, and as
her declination is greater.
