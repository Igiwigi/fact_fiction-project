the birds pass to countries where the days are shorter. In the African weaver finch,
to take an instance, the breeding season is in the autumn. These birds must pre-
sumably react to diminution and not to increase in light. Wrrscut (1935) records
that he has kept these birds at Iowa under constant food conditions and that their
autumn breeding seasons are most regular; also that young birds without exception
fell into line with their adult companions, even though they had travelled widely in
different parts of the country. With tropical birds living where there is little or no
variation in the length of day, seasonal breeding may still occur, as recorded by
BANNERMAN (1930, 1931, 1933) and others, and it is suggested that it is determined
by the recurrence of the rains and various ecological factors. â€˜These factors may also
act through the intermediation of the nervous system upon the anterior pituitary.

The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly all animals breeding
phenomena occur in response to seasonal change, and in the vast majority of these
(but not in all), as shown by observations. under both natural and experimental
conditions, the principal stimulus is increase of light. Changes in temperature and
food are generally eliminated by control observations, though in some cases these
factors not merely condition the phenomena but play a part in determining the
sexual cycle.

The general conclusion is reinforced by statistical studies of the times of breeding
of the domestic animals. In view of the practice adopted by poultry keepers of using
artificial light to increase and extend the time of egg production, Miss WHETHAM
undertook a statistical investigation based on available records to ascertain if there
were any relation between egg production and variation in daylight in different
