(1+20,)? in D, (0) would reduce the calculated oun below 362°4w? and (1—yd,)? raise
it in the Ca sub-group above 361'60w* and at the same time increase the factors in
the numbers above towards (1+64,)? and (1+4,)°.. The factors may of course enter
either as (142d)? or (1—ad)~*.

Collaterals.

The first set in doublet or triplet § or P series is always the stronger. The others
may be considered as receiving a sort of lateral displacement, by the atomic weight
term, in the recognised way, and may be called collaterals. This kind of displacement
is, however, not confined to the series generally recognised, but is of very common
occurrence, and, indeed, depends not only on the A but also on other multiples of 4.
In fact, the doublet and triplet series are only special cases of a law of very wide
application. Some evidence of its existence will be given below. It will be sufficient
now only to refer to certain points connected with the law, and to a convenient
notation to represent it. This kind of relation was first noted in the spectra of the
alkaline earths,* and as the lines are both numerous and at the same time strong and
well defined, and, therefore, with very small observation errors, any arguments based
on them must have special weight. Moreover, there are long series of step by step
displacements involving large multiples of A between initial and final lines, so that
we may feel some certainty that these large multiples are real and not mere
coincidences.

As a compact notation is desirable the following has been adopted. In generalt
the wave number of a line is determined by a formula of the form N/D,?—N/D,,?, and
