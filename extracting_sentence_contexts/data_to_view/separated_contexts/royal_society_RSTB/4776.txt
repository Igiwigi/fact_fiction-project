A consideration which has been still more influential in framing our method is that
even if we were to calculate the 52 partial regression coefficients showing the average
effect in bushels per acre of an extra inch of rainfall, for each week of the year, such a
calculation would leave out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect
may be expected to change continuously during the year. The true partial regression
coefficients for neighbouring periods must be relatively alike. The method of partial
correlation as hitherto developed, takes no account of the serial character of our weather
variates ; after calculating the partial regression coefficients, we should still be far from
the facts, if we did not smooth the series so obtained by a continuous curve, which
should average out the independent errors in the values obtained for the successive
weeks. Disregarding, then, both the arithmetical and the statistical difficulties, which a direct
attack on the problem would encounter, we may recognise that whereas with q subdi-
visions of the year, the linear regression equations of the wheat crop upon the rainfall
would be of the form

= C+ 47, + 4%, + ... af,

where 7, 72, ..., 7, are the quantities of rain in the several intervals of time, and
@, ... @, are the regression coefficients, so if infinitely small subdivisions of time were
taken, we should replace the linear regression function by a regression integral of the
form

w= e+ | ard, L otis bok wen ee ale

where 7 dé is the rain falling in the element of time dt; the integral is taken over the whole
period concerned, and a is a continuous function of the time ¢, which it is our object to
evaluate from the statistical data. It will be seen that by proceeding to the limit all artificiality has been eliminated from
the quantity @, which now represents an objective physical quantity, namely the average
benefit to the crop in bushels per acre per inch of rain, falling in the time-element con-
sidered.
