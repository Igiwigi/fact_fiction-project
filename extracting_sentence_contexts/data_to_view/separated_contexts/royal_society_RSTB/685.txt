22, 23, 24, and 24a). In this publication I
demonstrated the existence of what I ventured to call a bark-cambiwm between
the outermost cortex and its prosenchymatous zone, and through the meristemic
actions of which additions were constantly made to the exterior of that zone, through-
out the greater portion of the life of the plant; it being further evident that such
copious thickenings of the cortex equally affected the aerial stems, the branches, and
the Stigmarian roots. One fact more connected with this prosenchymatous zone is
seen in the specimen represented by fig. 1. Its first development in young twigs
does not advance simultaneously throughout the entire circle of the cortex.
