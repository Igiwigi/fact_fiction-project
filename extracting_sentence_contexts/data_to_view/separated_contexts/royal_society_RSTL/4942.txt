Thus, then, there exists in the
Myriapod *a circulating fluid‚Äù anterior to the trae-blood, which the latter gradually
supersedes, and *a respiration' which precedes that which snbsequently devolves
upon the tracheal system*,

In the adult Myriapod the blood is colourless and richly corpusculated. The cor-
puscles are perfectly destitute of colour. This fact is true of the fluid systems of all
articulated animals without a single exception. Wherefore this universal absence in
the fluids of a pigment-producing faculty? The floating bodies of the blood in the
adult Myriapod are regularly and determinately organized.
