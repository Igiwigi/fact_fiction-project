of models as well. In both KH and RM variable density flows the evolution equations for the
antisymmetric components of the Reynolds stress tensor would be required to capture vorticity
and turnover, depending on the fidelity required of the model. While these are a straightforward
extension (e.g. [65,77]), the validation studies against benchmark data have yet to be performed.
We expect that near future studies will use numerical and experimental data now available [83]
to perform the required validation comparisons.

(c) Numerical implementation

The spectral model calculations of LWN presented in this paper were performed with a code
using a second-order MacCormack scheme [84] for time integration. The code uses an exponential
grid for the wavenumber k =k; exp{z/zs;}, where k; and z; are scale factors and assumed to
be equal to unity [1]. The variables computed are, in fact kRyn, kRij, ka; and kb. This choice
of variables results in the cascade terms retaining a conservation form when expressed in
terms of z rather than k. Likewise, the values of the integrals of the spectral quantities are
easily determined, e.g. Run(t) = a” Rank, t) dk = sre Rnn(z, t)(ks/Zs) exp{z/Zs}dz. Setting k; and
Zs equal to 1 gives Run(t) =ste exp(z)Run(z, t) dz, where exp(z)Rnn(z, £) = kRnn(k, t) The explicit
MacCormack methodology is nominally second-order accurate in time and space, and uses two
steps. Each of the two steps uses single-sided differences for the first-order derivatives, and the
sides at which the differences are evaluated are different for the two steps, i.e. left side for the
first step and right side for the second. The boundary conditions at k= 1 and k =kmax are set to
Neumann (zero flux).
