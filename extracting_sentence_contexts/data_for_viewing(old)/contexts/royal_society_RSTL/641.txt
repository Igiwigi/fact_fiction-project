copper, and also of iron. But I cannot too strongly recommend
to those chemists who may engage in the research, to be very
particular in the choice of the specimens they make use of, and
also to make a great number of experiments, that they may
serve as objects of comparison to each other.

Having very favourable opportunities of examining, and com-
paring with each other, the different kinds of copper ore that
are found in the county of Cornwall, (which county furnishes a
greater variety of combinations of that metal than any other part
of Europe, several of which are peculiar to it,) it was impossible
that my attention should not be attracted by the many in-
teresting facts that came under my observation, Next to the
combinations of this metal with the arsenical acid, the study'of
its sulphurets has been the principal object of my pursuits; and,
if future circumstances should concur with my wishes in that
respect, I hope I $hall have it in my power to present to the
public the result of my observations on those sulphurets.
Â© Thoxe observations will, I trust, furnish additional proofs of
the truth of a circumstance respecting which I have long ceased
to have any doubts, and which I have already, on various occa-
sions, (particularly in my description of the arseniates of cop-
per,) attempted to establish, namely, that there exist many
minerals, which differ in species, although they have the same
