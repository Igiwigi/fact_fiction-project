rather its so-called ‘lower, unpaired half,” 7.¢., the first pair of basiventralia fused
into one mass, articulates solely with the cranial surface of the second hypochordal
mass, but not with Centrum II. The neural arch of the second vertebra is shifted
backwards upon the Centrum II., forming with it the first neuro-central suture. The
innermost portions of the ventral half of the atlas-ring do not ossify, but remain
cartilaginous or fibrous, and form in the adult Bird the ligamentum transversum
atlantis. It grasps round the odontoid process, and is perforated by the remnant of
the chorda. This ligamentum transversum is serially homologous with the “ inter-
vertebral pad” between the odontoid and the centrum of the epistropheus, It is
also homologous with the intervertebral pads which exist between any successive
vertebrae, in the shape of the so-called menisci or annuli fibrosi. These have been
well described by Jancer (Lit., No. 67), who in his carefully-written paper had
already drawn attention to the important fact that the atlas-ring does not articulate
with the Centrum II., but with a separate element interposed between the first two
centra. He had also shown the ligamentum transversum and the menisci to be
serially homologous structures. The centre of each meniscus is, of course, perforated
by the chorda dorsalis, the last trace of which remains as the ligamentum suspen-
sorium corporum vertebralium ; the first or foremost of these is the better known
ligamentum suspensorium dentis epistrophei.

Originally, and Frorter has been able to show this in the younger embryonic
stages, the ribs are carried entirely by the basiventralia, but they are soon transferred
upon the centra, which produce lateriventral processes which carry the capitulum, and
upon the dorsilateral processes or outgrowths of the neural arches, which carry the
tubercular end of the rib. In all birds each rib is carried by the centrum and by the
