Figure 8. Energy extraction of optimally controlled wind farms Â£o normalized by greedy reference case Ep. (a) Total energy
extraction. Error bars indicate confidence intervals of +2 standard deviations. (b) Energy extraction per row, normalized by first
row of reference case. From top: G3t0, red line; C3t5, yellow line; C3t30, light-blue line; C2t0, red dashed line; (2t5, yellow dashed

the comparable case of Goit et al. [4], for which an increase in energy extraction of approximately
6% was reported. This fact can be attributed to a better convergence of the current results
due to a judicious choice of optimization parameters as elaborated below and the update to a
quasi-Newton optimizer discussed previously. In figure 8b, it is shown that energy extraction
is increased in every downstream row by slightly downrating the first row for all cases except
C3t30. Moreover, the first row aside, the last row extracts the most energy for all cases, since
it does not have to take into account any downstream neighbours. We further performed for
the overinductive case with t =0s a case in which only the first row turbines were optimally
controlled (details not further shown here). We found energy gains of only 5% instead of 21%,
indicating that all turbines contribute significantly to the energy gains.

Figure 9 shows time-averaged axial velocities throughout the wind farm. Figure 9a illustrates
the axial velocity for the reference case. It can be seen that downstream turbines are subjected
to the wakes of their upstream neighbours, and that wake behaviour, i.e. spanwise wake extent
