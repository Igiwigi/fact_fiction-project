A part of the iron in
the stone was also in the state of sulphuret, as was evident by the sulphuretted hy-
drogen evolved on the action of acids. The result with regard to the su{phur was obtained in the form of sulphate of ba-
ryta; but though I haye entered it as sulphur only in the analysis, it did not all have
that state in the stone, for a part of it was there as sulphuric acid. In fact, water
only, when boiled with the stone, removed small portions both of snlphate of lime
and sulphate of soda; and this was the case when, on repeating the experiments, I
was very careful to take parts from the middle of the smaller fragment, parts which
had not seen the light until I broke them out. Tt is a question, however, whether
the soda belonged to the stone when it fell, and what proportion of sulphuric acid
was in it at that time; for the stone being porous and hygrometric, the water and
air in it may have converted a part of the sulphur into sulphuric acid ; and as to the
soda, I think it must have been acquired upon the earth ; for the water separated
also a portion of destructiþble organic substance, and the larger fragment of the stone
still has small particles of insoluble vegetable matter adhering to it, having the ap-
pearance of being derived from manure. I am, my dear Sir Jon,

Yours most faithfully,
