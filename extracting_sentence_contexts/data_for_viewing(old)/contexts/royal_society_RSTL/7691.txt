locus then is

Gd +4a&@ +46d — babed — 36c=0,
viz. this is a deyelopable surface, or torse, of the order 4, and we at once infer

(2x1, 1:)=4, agreeing with (2x1, 1: )=2m+1n—5.


WHICH SATISFY GIVEN CONDITIONS. 135

1 will show also that we have
(2x1, 1- /)=6, agreeing with (221, 1 - /)=2m+2n—6,
'The condition that the conic may touch an arbitrary line «7 +By +y2=0, is in fact
(0, —4i@, 2(464— 30), Zac, —$ab, 0Xs, Þ, y=0,

which, considering therein (@, 6, c, ) as coordinates, is the equation of a quadric surface
passing through the conic a=0, 46d —3c&=0; the quartic torse also passes through this
conic; hence the quadric surface and the torse intersect, in this conic, which is of
the order 2, and in a residual curve of the order 6; and the number of the conics
(2x1, 1 - /) is equal to the order of this residual curve, that is, it is =6.

If the conic touch a second arbitrary line e/z+þB'y+yz2=0, then we have in like
manner the quadric surface

(0, —4@&, $(464—3e&), $ac, —Zab, O0Xe', B, y)*=0;
