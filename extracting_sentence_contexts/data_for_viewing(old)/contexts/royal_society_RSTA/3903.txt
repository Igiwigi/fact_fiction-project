relationship is used to ‘nudge’ or programme data subjects into revealing more information or
taking actions that do not serve their interests.

From the analysts’ perspective, endogeneity and the use of purely mathematical or statistical
tools creates another issue: imprecision of data. In addition to quantifiable risk and noise, data
or the phenomena to which they ostensibly relate may be uncertain! or even ambiguous.’ This

For instance, the GDPR (see footnote 7) stipulates, in ch.2, article 5, Par. 1(d)1,, that data controllers must ensure that
“Personal data shall be ... (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
they are processed (“data minimisation”).

In the sense of Knight [13]: ‘Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk, from
which it has never been properly separated... The essential fact is that “risk” means in some cases a quantity susceptible
of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial
differences in the bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really present and operating... .. It will appear
that a measurable uncertainty, or “risk” proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it
is not in effect an uncertainty at all’.

15People are often more willing to take risks when the odds can (plausibly) be known than when the results are ambiguous,
even when the known probability offers a near-certain guarantee of failure and the ambiguous prospect could be a guarantee
of success [14].


applies to analysis of previously collected (e.g. empirical) data and also to the collection of new
data, since the experiment itself may change the underlying reality [15]. Along the way, certain
