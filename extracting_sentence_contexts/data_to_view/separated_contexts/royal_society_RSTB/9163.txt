As Schiffman &
Browning ef al. [51]. Naturally occurring cancers in mammals in Breen discuss, much of this increase in cancer susceptibility
the wild, such as the California sea lion, more closely resemble is due to the numerous genetic bottlenecks created during
human tumours than laboratory-induced tumours owing to a the phenotypic selection of purebred traits. In fact, specific
more similar overlap of genetic and environmental interactions. breeds remain at extraordinarily high rates for development
Browning et al. [51] report on the very high prevalence of uro- of specific cancer subtypes (e.g. Bernese mountain dogs and
genital carcinoma in the California sea lion population, histiocytic sarcoma, golden retrievers and lymphomas, Scot-
including aetiology related to genotype, persistent organic pol- tish terriers and urothelial carcinoma, and boxers and
lutants, and even a cancer-associated herpesvirus. As discussed, glioblastomas).
