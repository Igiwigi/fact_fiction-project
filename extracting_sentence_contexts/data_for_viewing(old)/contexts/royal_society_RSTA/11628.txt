causes), and that the influences of viscosity are extremely small. A remarkable
result is the extremely restricted character of the possible forms of steady motion as
contrasted with the case where the ocean covers a non-rotating globe, in which latter
case the possible forms of steady motion are to a large extent arbitrary. It is found
that if the density of the water is uniform, the only forms of steady motion possible
when the depth depends on the latitude alone are those in which the water always
moves along parallels of latitude, while in general the paths of the fluid particles
coincide with certain lines depending only on the distribution of land and water and
on the configuration of the ocean bed. The equation by which these lines are defined
is of an extremely simple character, and from it we could at once trace out the forms
of the stream-lines on a chart if we had a sufficient knowledge of the configuration
of the ocean bed. The equator will always be one of these stream-lines, and herein
we seem to have the explanation of the fact that the ocean-currents always tend to
set along the equator, but in other respects it is shewn that the effects of variations
of density will seriously interfere with the simple laws which must hold so long as
the density is uniform.

The importance of the earth’s rotation in influencing ocean-currents has long been
recognised by physicists, but I am not aware that any previous attempt has been
made to investigate this influence mathematically. ‘The numerical results obtained
in § 15 are interesting, as showing how a cause, which on a non-rotating globe could
not give rise to any appreciable currents, may be rendered highly effective in main-
taining currents as a consequence of the rotation of the earth.

In attempting to account for ocean currents, the real question at issue is: How
