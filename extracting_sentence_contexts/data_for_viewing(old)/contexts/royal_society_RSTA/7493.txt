to make the precise meaning of these notations clear, it is convenient to state the fundamental
relation in which the Q coefficients are used:

This is, in fact, a combination of theorem 18, part IV, and theorem 17, part VI. The
quantity y has been included to cover the values 1 and 0 which are required for different
cases.

9, THE EVALUATION OF SOME SCHRODINGER INTEGRALS
The derivation of the expansions for all the matrix elements of the Schrédinger Hamil-

tonian given in tables 9 to 13 will be effectively demonstrated if those between the following
functions are described as examples:
