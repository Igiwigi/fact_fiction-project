etc., and only one or two isolated cases are known where this is not so, of the 52 species
of Molgulids here investigated, 31 are unattached and live free in sand, mud or shell-
gravel (see Table I). Moreover, the average size of the free-living forms is about three
times that of the attached forms, and the former are typically oviparous, as distinct
from the latter.

The free forms usually become embedded in the sand and anchored more or less firmly
by means of the very numerous extensions of the test to which sand grains adhere.
Of the attached forms listed in Table I, 7.e., 21, at least 5 have their outer surface covered
with sand, two are anchored by long slender stalks, and many others possess numerous
fine test extensions.

These facts taken together suggest that the primitive habitat of the Molgulide is
that of the open sand and mud flats, and that the relatively large ovoid individuals,

oviparous and unattached, colonised the rocky shore regions. In so doing, as has
already been argued, their attachment to hard and relatively smooth surfaces exposed
to wave action, involved a reduction in size, and consequent viviparity.

It is therefore assumed that the Molgulidie are to be considered typically as dwellers
of the sand flats, a view already put forward both by Rrrrer (1913) and by Garstana
(1928).*
