when a large amount is injectod: this local muscular action was recognised by
Racorzr and others.

When one enquires after the grounds on which a central action in the frog
has been supported by other authors, one finds that Brunron and Fayrer’s belief in
the depression of the spinal cord is chiefly based on a few (mainly five) of their many
experiments, in which the reflexes disappeared, while movement could still be elicited
by stimulation of the peripheral nerves or of the cord itself; in some the stimulation
of the cord was ineffective, while that of the peripheral nerves caused movement. In
all of these the animal had been subjected to a severe operation previously, in some
the circulation is stated to have been feeble, and in others the amount of poison
given may be judged as very high when the short interval before symptoms set in is
considered. In view of the fact that in the great majority of their experiments no
evidence of depression of the spinal cord is presented, one cannot help feeling that
these authors were unduly impressed by the results of this small minority.

Watt's and Aron’s experiments were all performed with large doses, as is shown by
paralysis occurring within 40 minutes, and Racorzr suggests that the final paralysis
arose not from direct action on the nervous apparatus, but largely from heart failure.

VouuMER satisfied himself that the peripheral action is developed, but brings no
evidence whatever in support of his view that the centres were also effected.

There is thus little experimental support for the supposed central action of cobra
venom in the frog, and the symptoms when examined are seen to be those of a slowly
