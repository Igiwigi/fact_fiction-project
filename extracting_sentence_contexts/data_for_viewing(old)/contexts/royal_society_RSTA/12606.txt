As already remarked, it is difficult to avoid sensible fluctuations in the standard of
character figiffes, but the range figures support the character figures in representing
1893—the year of largest sunspot frequency—as very decidedly less disturbed than
the two adjacent years. Again, all the criteria agree in representing 1900 as decidedly
the quietest year, though 1890 had fewer sunspots.

The range of the regular diurnal inequality was largest in the year of sunspot
maximum. Other things being the same, the absolute range would naturally increase
with that of the diurnal inequality. There is thus nothing surprising in the fact that
the D and H absolute ranges in 1891, 1895, and 1896 are exceeded by those of 1893,
though the character figure obtained for the latter year is less. Whether the character

figure for 1892 ought really to be less than that for 1896, and whether the
character figure of 1895 should be the largest of all, are results more open to doubt.
The mean of the absolute daily ranges in 1892 and 1894, whether in H or D, decidedly
exceeded that of any other year; but this was at least partly due to the incidence in
these two years of an altogether outstanding proportion of the largest magnetic storms
of the 11 years.
