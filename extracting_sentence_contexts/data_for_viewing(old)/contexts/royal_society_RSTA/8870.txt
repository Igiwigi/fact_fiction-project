that the electrons are liberated by the chemical action in such a manner that for practical
purposes they can be considered to be clear of the fields of force of the atoms or mole-
cules of origin. As to the validity or otherwise of this last assumption there was no
prior evidence, but the experiments show that it is at least approximately satisfied and
that small accelerating electric fields have little or no effect in increasing the electron
emission. Subject to the validity of the assumptions referred to, the currents in any
accelerating field should be constant, whilst their values in any retarding field will be
a measure of the number of electrons whose kinetic energy when emitted exceeds the
equivalent applied retarding potential difference. It should, in fact, be equal to the
number of such electrons divided by the electronic charge. A characteristic curve
satisfying such conditions for the case of the concentric spherical electrodes will there-
fore solve the problem so far as the total kinetic energy is concerned. Stated in this
way the matter appears very simple, but it has been found in practice to be fraught
with very serious difficulties which have taken a long time to overcome.

In all the experiments the metal acted on was a liquid alloy of sodium and potassium.
In the majority of them this had an initial composition corresponding to the formula
NaK,. The alloy of this formula appears* to have the lowest melting point, and it is
a quite mobile liquid at room temperatures. In some of the early experiments an alloy
of higher melting point having the initial composition NaK was used. This fact will
be mentioned when it is necessary to refer to those experi-
