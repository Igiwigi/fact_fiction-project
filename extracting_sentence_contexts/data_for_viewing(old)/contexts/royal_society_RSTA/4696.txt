It can be noted that some of the rings within figure 2 are densely populated while others are
more sparse. The contribution with greatest coverage corresponds to the eighth ring [9]. This
paper concerns system identification, with an emphasis on Bayesian methods: finding models
and their parameter values to represent a given phenomenon, with their associated uncertainty
distributions. The proponents of this approach contend that it can be applied to nearly everything
within the field of nonlinear structural dynamics (and indeed any domain where models are
developed in conjunction with field data). This connection to ‘nearly everything’ is appealing,
and there is certainly scope for wider application of the methods that are under development.


There are two significant impediments to widespread adoption of these methods: a psychological 1s |
barrier, as the language of Bayesian inference is not generally well known in industry; and also
the fact that such methods still require efficient underlying numerical models that can feasibly “3
be computed many times. The developments presented in this theme issue [9] go some way to 1B
minimizing the number of simulation runs necessary. 1
Other rings appear rather sparse, such as rings 9 and 11 [10,12]. This is partly an artefact :3
of fragmentation, and figure 4 shows the actual percentage contribution of each article, colour- :
coded by group heading. This shows that each paper relates directly to about 10-20% of the map
(exception [9] aside), and indirectly to 20-30%.

This article has documented an attempt to create a map, or ‘consultant’s checklist’, associated with [=
the field of nonlinear structural dynamics. The idea is that the map should be a living document, : Sy
