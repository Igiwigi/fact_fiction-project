a mathematically and conceptually clear formulation,
and general relativity quite directly predicts its own
breakdown in the form of singularities. Many speculative
extensions of the standard model that were proposed
in the last 20 years have already been ruled out by
LHC. The fact that many suggestive and ingenious,
yet ‘conservative’ modifications and extensions of the
existing theories failed to provide correct experimental
predictions suggests—at least to some researchers—that
a radical rethinking of the foundations of physics and
the basic structure of physical theories is required if we
want to overcome the problems of our existing theories
and make progress towards a unified theory of physics. Hence the motivation to (re)consider the foundations
of physics. Historically, geometry has always played a key
role in the formulation and understanding of physical
