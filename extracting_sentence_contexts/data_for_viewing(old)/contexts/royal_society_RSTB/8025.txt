embryonic origin.

The neonatal ovary

The material includes the ovaries and uteri of two very young calves (see table 2). One,
E134, was probably not more than about a week old, and the other, E119, was probably at
least a month old. The intact ovaries of E134 are shown in figure 9; figure 12 is a photo-
graph of a section, 12 in thickness, through one of them, and figure 21, plate 7, shows a
portion of the same section at a higher magnification. The two ovaries of this animal
together weighed about 20 g, as compared with 80g, the approximate weight (from
preservative) of the ovaries of the foetus of E84. As the photographs show, the reduction
is mainly accounted for by the regression of the interstitial cells from their hypertrophied
condition. The interstitial tissue is still conspicuous, however, and in fact up to this
stage its regression has for the most part consisted of a reduction in the size of the
individual cells. The ovaries of the second calf, E119, are similar in size and in general
appearance to those of E134, but the interstitial tissue has changed considerably in character.
The cells are somewhat dispersed and the cytoplasm shows a greater degree of vacuolation.
In parts of the ovary blocks of interstitial cells are evidently being altered in form and
redistributed in the stroma after losing their characteristic glandular appearance (figure 22,

plate 7). The vacuolation bears no resemblance to that which is so conspicuous a feature
of regression of the luteal cells of the corpora lutea, where the individual cells eventually
