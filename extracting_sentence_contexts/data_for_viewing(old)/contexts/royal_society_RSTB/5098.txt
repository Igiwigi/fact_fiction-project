intercentrum, these lie essentially on the lower surfaces of the transverse processes,
which in the dorsal region project strongly, standing out beyond the sides of the centra ;
their distal ends bear facets for the articulation of the tubercles of the ribs, Definite
pedicels can scarcely be said to exist, the neural canal being extremely small and lying
between the inner ends of the transverse processes. The pre- and post-zygapophyses

are powerful, their articular faces having the normal direction and being inclined at
about 45Â° to the horizontal. The neural spine is of considerable height, laterally
compressed and long ; it rises from the roots of the zygapophyses. The whole neural
arch is in fact strikingly like that of the first dorsal vertebra of Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus.

The sacral vertebra preserved in D.M.S.W. 29 differs from a dorsal in that the head
of the rib has an articulation on the centrum as well as on the intercentrum.

The isolated and perhaps really indeterminable vertebral column D.M.S.W. 33,
agrees exactly, so far as it can be compared, with the scattered elements belonging
to the individual whose skull is D.M.8.W. 27, and its first sacral rib agrees closely with
an example associated with characteristic scutes on D.M.S.W. 32. I therefore use it
here because it is certain that whether or not it actually belongs to Hogyrinus it does
agree with that animal in the important morphological features it shows and in size.
The specimen was described and figured by Empeuron, 1889, whose account, for its
time an excellent one, is inaccurate and incomplete in one or two respects.
