Or it may be thought that the productive measures of
these coalfields all belong to one horizon, and that we are dealing with floras of local
distribution, and not with assemblages representing different stages in the evolution
of Carboniferous vegetation. It would be out of place here to attempt to justify the
existence of paleeobotanical horizons, or the validity of the large amount of work
which has been done, in recent years and in many lands, on the study of the vertical,
as well as the lateral, distribution of Carboniferous plants. As a reply, however, to
such a possible criticism, attention may be called to the fact that an essentially
similar problem, and one quite independent of the palobotanical evidence, is still
unsolved in the Midlands. â€˜This is the relationship of the Southern Midland to the
North Midland coalfields. The latter, comprising the basins of South Lancashire on
the West, and Yorkshire, with extensions into Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, on
the East, are now very well known, both geologically and palaobotanically.
