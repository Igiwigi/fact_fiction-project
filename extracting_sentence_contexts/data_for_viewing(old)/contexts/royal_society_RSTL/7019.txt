ON THE BRAINS OF TWO IDIOTS OF EUROPEAN DESCENT. * 543

- In the two fatal brains represented by Lzvrer and GraTtoLEY, already alluded to, the
parts in front of the fisxure of RoLaxpo, comprising the frontal lobe and the s0-called
anterior ascending parietal convolution (which latter s8hould, I think, be as8ociated
with the frontal region itself), form a far larger proportion of the entire cerebrum than
they do in the idiots' brains. In the brain of the human fetus between the fourth and
fifth months (Plate XXIII, figs. 21 & 22), in which the fissure of RoLaxyo (4-4), the
great parallel temporal fissure ( f'), and the perpendicular fissure (Ã¾) are clearly traceable,
the same fact is well illustrated. In fcetal brains at still earlier periods* the same thing
is observable, whilst at later periods than the seventh month the parts in front of the
fissure of RoLanDo become till longer in proportion to those behind it. Indeed, in the

A A normal course of development, there is no period at which the frontal part seems, as it
a N were, to stand still, or retrograde relatively to the rest of the cerebrum ; but after once the
- fissure of ROLANDO is formed, there is a variable but progressive relative increase of the
S parts in front of that fissure. It is certain, therefore, that the frontal lobes of the idiots'
Q 5 cerebra are not proportionally developed in comparison with the temporo-parietal regions.
PThe 8ame appears to me to be true likewise of the occipital lobe; but we may confine
Sthe argument here to the defective state of the frontal lobes.
Z Fully to appreciate the importance of the diminutive size of these last-named lobes,
2 we must take into account certain facts to be hereafter stated in detail, regarding the
