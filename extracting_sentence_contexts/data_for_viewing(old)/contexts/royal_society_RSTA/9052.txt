Coming now to (iii) the reasons against this have already been given in §2. It would
amount to a difficulty analogous to that of Stoxms when the inertia-terms in two-dimen-
sional motion are neglected. A difficulty of this class appears to be inherent in the
approximate type of equations selected, and one can hardly admit that it is essential to
the physics of the problem. SroxKes’ difficulty disappears if we replace his equations
by those of OszEn, and there seems no reason to doubt that the use of more exact equations
would remove also the present one. Looked at from this point of view, (iii) is largely
identical with (iv).

We are thus almost inevitably driven to the conclusion (iv), that the method of
approximation is unsound. Now examination of the expressions (19.1), (19.2) will show
that the most important terms in our second approximation for the velocities are, in fact,
of smaller order than the most important terms in the first approximation.

Thus away from the tail the most important terms of second order are of magnitude
r~*”, those of the first order of magnitude 7~'; in the tail the most important terms of
second order are of magnitude (log 7/r), those of the first order of magnitude r~*. There
is thus, so far as we have gone, no apparent failure of convergency.

The approximation appears to fail in virtue of its having been applied to the terms in
%o, dy in the first order solution. We cannot get over the difficulty by making a», dy) = 0,
for % = 0 would cause the drag to vanish, and d, = 0 would cause the lift to vanish
(see ‘‘ Forces *’).
