If
we attribute the whole difference to error in determining the
value of 2, when the magnets revolved under the disc alone,
which however I have no reason for thinking should be done,
the value of z would till in this case be only 23g. Increasing
this in proportion to the values of Â« in Table VII. the mag-
netism developed in the uncut disc, diameter 8:4 inches, that
in the ring alone, diameters 8:4 and 4-4 inches, and that in
the disc alone, diameter 4:4 inches, would very nearly be
represented respectively by 1517, 880, and 26. That the magnetism destroyed by the remoyal of a portion


the particles of magnetic bodies, &c. 91

of any mass should be more than a proportional part of the
whole, does not appear extraordinary ; but that the removal
of a portion, in which, separately, the magnetism developed
is represented by 26, should cause a diminution represented
by 687 in the magnetism developed in the mass, or more than
24 times its separate effect; and that the separation should
be nearly equivalent to the removal, are striking, and, I think,
important facts in the investigation of the laws according to
which magnetism is communicated to, and distributed in re-
volving bodies. These results are in perfect accordance with
those which I have deduced from the experiments with the
disc I.

It follows then from these experiments, that, in the de-
velopement of induced magnetism by rotation, every portion
of a mass contributes towards the intensity of the magnetism
developed, and that in a much greater ratio than would, by
direct induction, be due to that portion according to its
distance from the magnet ; s0 that there appears to be, as it
were, an accumulation of magnetism arising from the mutual
action of the several particles upon each other ; continuity
throughout has thus a much greater influence than mass : a
complete solution of continuity, when it does not take place
in the parts adjacent to the magnet, is very nearly equivalent
to an entire removal of the remoter mass s0 separated ; and
in all cases, the effect produced by complete separation is not
much less than that produced by removal. 92 Mr. CurisTIE on the mutual action of
