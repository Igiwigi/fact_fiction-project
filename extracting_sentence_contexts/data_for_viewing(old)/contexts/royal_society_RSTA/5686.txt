(d) Generating forecasts with quantified uncertainty

The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo procedure described in §2b produces a set of samples that
concentrate in regions of high probability in the posterior distribution p(@|D). Approximating
this distribution is central to our workflow as it enables the generation of future forecasts x*(t*)
at time instances t* of size N* with quantified uncertainty via computing the predictive posterior
distribution

p(x*(t*)|D, t*) = [rcrcene, t*)p(0|D) de. (2.9)

This predictive distribution provides a complete statistical characterization for the forecasted
states by encapsulating epistemic uncertainty in the inferred dynamics, as well as accounting
for the fact that the model was trained on a finite set of noisy observations. This allows us


to generate GP-NODE-based plausible realizations of x*(t*,@) by sampling from the predictive
posterior distribution as
