S The earths were in 1789 indecomposable in point of fact, when LavoisleR expressed the
©» opinion that they were compounds, oxides of unknown metals. LavoisgR's argumenta-
En was based on the fact that the earths enter as bases into salts, and that it was to be
S assumed in regard to all salts, that they contained an oxygen acid and an oxygen base. But the view, founded on the same basis, that common salt contains oxygen, and the
Zzubsequent view that what is now called chlorine contained a further quantity of
Soxygen besides the elements of an oxygen acid, did not find an equally permanent recog-
"Znition, On the basis of the actual indecomposability of chlorine, Davy maintained
2from about 1810 its elementary character; and this view has become general, especially
Srincs BERzELIUS, after a long struggle against it, adopted it, more I think because he
*Zwas outvoted than because he was convinced. = Almost all chemists of the present time consider chlorine, and in conformity therewith
bromine and iodine, as elementary bodies; but the persistence is known with which
8ondxmRIN attacks this view, and adheres to the opinion that these bodies are oxygen
