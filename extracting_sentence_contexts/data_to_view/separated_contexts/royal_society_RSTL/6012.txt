T had visited all the glaciers hitherto mentioned, and others not mentioned, without

obtaining more than one clear case of the kind: this case I observed upon the Aletsch
Splacier on the 6th of August. Not far from the junction of the Middle Aletsch glacier
Avith the trunk stream, a crevasse exposed a wall of ice 50 or 60 feet in height, upon
Syhich the stratification was exposed, and cutting the stratification at a high angle were
Sthe groovings which marked the true veined structure. The association was distinct ;
any friend Professor Ramsay was with me at the time; I drew his attention to the fact. Sand to him the case was perfectly conclusive. Thus the Aletsch glacier, which had
Sheen referred to by Mr. Barr as furnishing evidence against the pressure theory, gave
Sus a fact, which, as far as I could see, was perfectly fatal to the theory of stratiti-
Zeation.
