TOOTH-REPLACEMENT IN THERIODONT REPTILES 139

These three specimens seem to indicate fairly clearly that, as in the described
Cynodonts,. the teeth in Dimetrodon belong in two series the members of which
alternate and are replaced at somewhat different stages. If this is true, there are
three points which call for some comment.

In the specimen B the first, third, and fifth teeth are well developed while the
second and fourth are being replaced. There is, however, a replacing-tooth at the
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only just appearing while the second
and fourth replacing-teeth are partly erupted suggests that the replacement of the,
in this specimen, odd numbered teeth must have followed quickly on the replacement
of the even numbered.

In the third specimen the most outstanding feature is the apparent absence of
replacing-teeth from the empty alveoli, a condition which might be claimed to. show
that the loss of certain teeth was purely fortuitous and had nothing to do with
replacement. We know, however, that during the replacement of a tooth the bone
is resorbed around the roots and that the replacing-tooth moves down into an
enlarged alveolus. In any animal which died during this process there would be a
greater chance of the loss of a replacing-tooth than of those teeth which are held in
the jaw in a normal manner.
