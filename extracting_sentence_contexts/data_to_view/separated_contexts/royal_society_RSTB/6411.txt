Their significance is obscure but they are probably responsible
for the disposal of the yolk-like particles mentioned above. The cells rapidly
increase in size and reach a maximum during blastokinesis, after which they
gradually become smaller, All these changes mentioned above might suggest a

relation to exist between the suboesophageal body and blastokinesis. However,
the fact that this body is absent in some insects, which undergo a marked blasto-
kinesis (Forficula), and present in others, where no blastokinesis occurs, is against any
such hypothesis. The suboesophageal body is present even in the freshly hatched
hopper, where it occupies a small area beneath the anterior end of the crop. Whether
it persists in the latter instars has not been ascertained.
