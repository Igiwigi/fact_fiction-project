aa would appear, from the facts so far set forth, that the fate of the microbe in the
â€™s lymph depends upon the activity of two kinds of cellular elements. Are we
attribute, therefore, no part in the conflict to the non-ameeboid cells which are

eRarged with rose-staining granules? This question is at once answered by the fact

a. of the conditions apparently necessary to a successful issue to the conflict

een the eosinophile cells and the micro-organisms, whether the conflict occur in
body or out of the body, is an increase in the number, and still more in the size
granulation of these cells. In the lymph of newly-captured, healthy Frogs, the
rgse-staining cells are usually very small, and so few in number, that they would be

Empletely overlooked were it not for the brilliant rose tint which their granules take

ith methylene-blue. This condition is shown in figs. 4 and 5a.
