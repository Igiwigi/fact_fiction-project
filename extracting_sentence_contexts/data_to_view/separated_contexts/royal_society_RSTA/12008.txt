The conception of an unchanging configuration
which can exist in the present rotational zther is limited to a vortex ring with such
associated intrinsic strain : this is accordingly our specification of an atom. The
I elastic effect of convection through the medium of an atom thus charged is equivalent
to that of a twist round its line of movement : such a twist is thus a physical element
_ of an electric current.
113. The chief result of the discussion is that a rotationally elastic fluid «ther
" gives a complete account of the phenomena of optical transmission, reflexion, and
refraction, in isotropic and crystalline media, coinciding in fact formally in its wider
features with the electric theory of light; and that it gives a complete account of
