(1) Symbol of Hydrogen.—T am about to show by the aid of the principles which
have been established in the previous pages that the units of chemical snbstances are
composed of an integral number of s8imple weights; that is to say, according to the
definition previously giyen (Sec. L. Def. 9 & 10), that these units are * integral com-
pound weights.” The point will be demonstrated if it be found possible to express the
symbols of these units in the actual system of chemical equations by means of an integral
number of prime factors, these factors being the 8ymbols of real weights (Sec. V. (9 & 10)).
Now it will be found that such an expression is not only possible, but possible in a great
variety of ways; in other words, many assumptions may be made as to the composition
of ponderable matter which are consistent with the above fundamental hypothesis. From
these possible expressions, that one;will in each case be selected, as the correct inference
from the facts, in which the symbol is expressed by the smallest possible number of such
factors; since any other expression, as has before been indicated, must involve hypo-
theses which are unnecessary.

The problem is not dissimilar to that of the determination of the density or relative
weight of the same units. We are about to estimate the number and the absolute
weight of the simple weights of which the units (Sec. I. Def. 8 & 10) of ponderable
matter are composed ; and, as in the former case the problem is unmeaning unless the

standard of absolute or relative weight be previously determined, so in the latter case
