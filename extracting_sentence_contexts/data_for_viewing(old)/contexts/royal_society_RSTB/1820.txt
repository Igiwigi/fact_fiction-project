Owing to the small size of the objects, and the somewhat contracted condition of
most of the fixed material, it has not hitherto been found possible to bring to view a
nucleus in the cel]. Considering the size of the cell, the nucleus, if it exists, must be
excessively minute. We have hopes, however, that we may later, by the aid of other
material, be able to distinguish such a structure. All that we can establish at
present is that the interior is filled with a protoplasmic body, in the centre of which
lies a single yellow-green chromatophore.

The central channels in each plate naturally suggest protoplasmic protrusions from
the cell, though no trace of them was observed in any of the specimens. That the
protoplasm passes at least into the canal of the plate is suggested by analogy with
Rhabdosphera Tubifer (to be described later) ; and further, the fact that the external
depression and canal within the plate sometimes become filled with colour under the
action of gentian violet, also points in the same direction, The stain, however, may
have been held in the minute cavity only by capillarity.

The only evidence we can bring forward as to the method of reproduction of
Coccosphera leptopora is an isolated observation of an individual which was obviously
undergoing fission into two (Plate 15, fig. 7).* The body was large and oval in form,
and had become slightly but distinctly pinched in on one side, the chromatophore had
already divided into two, and the plates were considerably increased in number, as one
would expect. The organism must obviously increase in size by the intercalation of
new plates between the old ones, but no trace of small or immature plates was
observed in any of the specimens examined.
