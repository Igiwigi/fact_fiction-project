Introduction.

THis paper aims, in general, at giving an atomistic theory for magnetic phenomena
in ferromagnetic crystals. In particular, it explains theoretically WexsrEr’s experi-
mental results with regard to iron crystals.

As has been pointed out in the abstract,*, the fundamental fact of interest in experi-
ments on magnetic substances is that the direction of magnetization I does not in
general coincide with the direction 4 of the external field H. Experiments on iron
crystals have now revealed that this deviation-effect (¢ — ) exists even in crystals
of cubic structure and a symmetrical boundary. In other words, cubical symmetry
does not make a body magnetically isotropic, as was erroneously assumed by Farapay,
TynpDALL and Priicker. ‘To account for this deviation, and in general to relate the
two directions ¢, 4, with each other must certainly be the object of any theory bearing
on this subject. Accordingly, Wxtss developed a macroscopic theory by introducing
the conception of the molecular field. This idea served many useful purposes, especially
in connection with pyrrhotite. But as is shown in the present paper, it is not adequate
to explain the phenomena in the case of crystals with a cubic structure.
