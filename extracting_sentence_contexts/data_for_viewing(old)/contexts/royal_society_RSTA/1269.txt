have the case ||1/||o. =r and then |u'(#)| < Q(r) by the bound of proposition 4.3. We now have

1 1
Au(t) = I, G(t, s)f(s, u(s), u’(s)) ds < I, G(t,s)mr ds,

and taking the maximum over [0,1] gives Ar < r, a contradiction. a

Remark 5.2. We can suppose that f(t, u,p) < mr for t € [0,1], 0<u <r and |p| < Q(r), and that
Nu 41 on dxU,;. The same conclusion holds.

6. Zero index result

We now use the fact that elements of K are concave, hence u(t) > y(#)||U/\loo where y (f) = min{t, 1 —
t}. By exploiting properties of the Green’s function it is sometimes possible to obtain a better
estimate, namely a larger function y than the one just written, for example see some of the results
in [1,2,19]. Similarly, it is also possible for more complicated differential equations (in place of u’’)


to obtain an inequality such as u(t) > y(t)||u\|oo when concavity is not available. However, we do
not pursue this here.

We now consider a subset [a, b] of (0,1) and let y := min{a, 1 — b}, then u(t) > y||tl|loo for t € [a, b].
Let V; := {u EK: minjefa py u(t) < rand ||u'||oo < Q(r/y) + 1}.

Theorem 6.1. Suppose there exists r > 0 such that f(t,u,p) > Mr for t € [a,b], r<u<r/y and |p| <
