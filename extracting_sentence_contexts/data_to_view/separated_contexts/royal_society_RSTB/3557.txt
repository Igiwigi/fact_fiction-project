THE EARLIEST EUROPEAN ANGIOSPERMS. 81 The actual age of the beds, however, is determined by the fact that they are
clearly overlain by the Gault, and also by the presence of indigenous fossils such
as Waldheimia woodwardi, Terebratula depressa, Opis neocomiensis, Trigonia
aleformis, and others in situ. Lamptuen and Waker (1903), in an important paper on the neighbourhood,
established the fact that, in undoubted Lower Greensand which was overlain by
Gault, was a fossiliferous band containing a fauna with distinctly Upper Cretaceous
affinities. From the present point of view, it is of interest to note this in connection
with the flora, which also suggests a more modern aspect than that of the preceding
beds.
