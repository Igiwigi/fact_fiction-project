5. Consider now the (p+2)™ equation X in regard to its first element. As before, this will be independent of «,'....'; but on account of the extra term
arising from dy/dt, which now enters for the first time, the coefficient of x,' is not
zero. It is, in fact, —1. Thus, the quantities 0,'...,., beimg now known, this equation gives 2,'. Similarly, the next group’s first member will contain the term —2z,' but will not
contain «,'...2',4,, and will therefore give a,' after a,’ is found.
