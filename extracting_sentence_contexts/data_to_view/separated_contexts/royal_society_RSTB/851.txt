He mentions the dense opaque subcutaneous layer to which the silvery brilliance
of many Fishes is due, under the name of “’argenture,” and states that it is composed
of “lames minces étalées 4 plat,” and states that the same particles distributed con-
fusedly in a tissue act in the manner of transparent substances reduced to a powder
and produce a sort of dull silveriness completely opaque. This description applies
to the argenteum of Flat Fishes described below, although Poucurr does not mention
it in this connection. He recognizes also that the properties of the iridocytes and
of the lamelle of the argenteum are due to the same organic substance, which he says
appears to be always of cellular origin, but he does not refer to the fact that this
substance is the definite chemical compound guanin, making no mention of the
researches of BARRESWIL and Voir quoted in our next section. Our own observations have been directed principally to the coloration of the skins
of Flat Fishes or Pleuronectide, and we shall describe the skins of these in detail,
referring to a few other species for the sake of comparison. If a thin superficial slice
of the upper side of a Flounder or Plaice is examined under a low power, elements of
two kinds are seen, namely chromatophores and iridocytes, forming a beautiful mosaic.
