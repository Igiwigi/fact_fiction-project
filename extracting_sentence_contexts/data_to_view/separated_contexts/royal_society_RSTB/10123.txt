These brain activities are
located in the posterior aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus,

which on the left hemisphere, corresponds to Brocaâ€™s area. In
parallel, other studies investigated the brain mechanisms
associated with the processing of music (another instance of
action-related sound) with a particular focus on the role
of expertise. In fact, musicians are a particular example of
sensorimotor expertise. Experts have been particularly useful
in cognitive neuroscience, being an interesting model
of over-learned sensorimotor associations [11,12]. Indeed, play-
ing music is a multifaceted ability requiring years of practice
to master, as it is based on the coordination of many different
skills.
