photonic crystal waveguides when pairs of left- and right-handed C-points collide and annihilate
at the bandedge. C-points exist away from the bandedge, but as they approach each other, their
proximity means that the electric field strength is small. We find that the fall-off in the LDOS due
to this decreasing electric field strength is faster than the increase due to the decreasing group
velocity, meaning that the LDOS (and, therefore, the coupling strength to dipole-like emitters)
has a maximum value at vg ~c/10.

We also investigated a photonic crystal waveguide with glide symmetry and degenerate
modes at the bandedge. This degeneracy allows the two modes to be the time-reverse partners
of each other, allowing the existence of chirality and C-points even in standing waves at
the bandedge. However, their time symmetry requires the two degenerate modes to possess
oppositely handed C-points at the same location and same frequency, meaning that neither one
can be exploited in isolation for applications. In fact, as the waveguide is multi-moded in the
slow-light regime, we see that the left- and right-handed C-points approach and annihilate in
frequency rather than in space. We note that the lowest group velocity for useful C-points is
Ug Â© c/6, corresponding to when the waveguide supports a single mode.

Our analysis of C-points in the slow-light regime highlights some of the difficulties to be
overcome to exploit chirality in quantum information applications. Both photonic crystal designs
considered here can provide useful functionality only down to very modest slowdown factors


of vg *c/10. The mechanisms that cause the annihilation of the C-points in the waveguides
considered here are likely to be generally applicable to other photonic crystal and slow-light
designs. However, we believe that alternative designs can be found to extend this useful range
