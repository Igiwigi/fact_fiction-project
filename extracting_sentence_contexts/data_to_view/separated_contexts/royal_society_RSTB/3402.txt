observed figures in each case. The average percentage deviation between the calculated
and observed figures is 1°59 per cent. if the blood volume be calculated according to
our view, while it is 5:71 per cent. if expressed as percentage of the body weight. Our experiments upon freshly-caught normal and healthy mammals which have
lived in a natural state, such as hares, wild rabbits, and wild rats, therefore prove
as clearly as did our experiments upon the tame rabbit, guinea-pig, and mouse, that
our formula B = W'/k (indicating that the blood volume is a function of the surface)
holds good, and represents the experimental facts in an extremely satisfactory
manner, At the same time it is obvious from these experiments that the blood
volume as percentage of body weight is, in any given species of the animals
investigated, anything but a constant, and that any attempt to express it as such
must be misleading and tend to obscure an important truth,

In Table XI are given the different species of animals upon which we have
determined the blood volume, the range of their weights, and the average differences
between the blood volume calculated, (@) as a function of the surface, and (b) as
percentage of the body weight, and the observed figures.
