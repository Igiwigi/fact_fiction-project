Thus, @ is an element of Lie algebra SO(1, 2). A matrix B belongs to SO(1, 2) iff it is of the form

0 by bis
B=|bo 0 by}. (6.11)

Now, assignment

defines an injective map. In fact, this map is a Lie algebra isomorphism of SO(1,2) and R®
considered as Lie algebra with Lie bracket defined by C; see (6.6).
If for X, Y € R° we have Z = YX, then Z= XY where

Let us set r; = AR; with R; =0, for i=0,1. Then
+; = AR; = AQR;, (6.14)
and the kinetic energy can be rewritten in the following form:
T = y1mo](A@Ro, AQRo) + 31m J(AVR,, AQR)) = 522, (6.15)
