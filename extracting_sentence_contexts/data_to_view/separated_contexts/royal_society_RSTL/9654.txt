For the
orbital momentum of a planet varies as the cube root of its periodic time, and if we differentiate logarith-
mically we obtain the increment of periodic time in terms of the increment of orbital momentum. Then
taking the numerical data from Tables I. and IT. we 8ee that this statement is proyed by the fact that
3x33 times [216+01720 x 109] x 365-25 x 24 is very nearly equal to unity,

534 MR. G. H. DARWIN ON THE

In the review referred to I examined the eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits
of the several other satellites, and found them to present indications favourable to the
theory. In the present paper I have given reasons for supposing that the tidal fric-
tion arising from the action of the other satellites on their planets cannot have had 80
much effect as in the case of the earth.
