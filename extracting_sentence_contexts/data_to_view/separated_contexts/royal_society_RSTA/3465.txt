If the pair of functions /4 and /z exist and there is a point a such that 14(@) = 1g(@) := b, then the
pair (a, b) is a candidate to solve (2.19). If either of the sets {x €]a,a] |x ¢ D.} and {x e]b, B\|x¢Da}
is not empty, then these sets need to be ‘covered’ by a continuation region using the approach
described in [17, case VI]. If (a,b) are located, then A and B can be identified by noting (2.8) with
(2.10) and (2.11), and the equivalent expression for E, implying that

Au_ (2 ) vV@ (3 ) Wo)
wa) Wa \ve)) We)

Gal #(a) (5) #°(b)
o(a))} Wa) ob) W(b)”

These facts enable the innovation taken here, where we solve a practical, complex,
optimization problem based only on knowledge of E, F, y and ¢, without any presumption of the
stochastic differential equation (2.1). The assumption that ~ and ¢ are as (2.2)-(2.6) is substantial,
though weaker than the assumption that the process is given by a particular choice of b and
which deliver y and @. In [15], conditions are specified for the pay-off and diffusion parameters
that will ensure that the pair of functions |, and /p exist and there is a unique paizr, (a, b), such that
1, (a) = Ip(a) = b.
