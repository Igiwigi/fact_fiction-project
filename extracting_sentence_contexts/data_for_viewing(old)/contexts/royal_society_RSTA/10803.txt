When the assumed forms for the P-function and for the cosine- and sine-functions
are substituted in the differential equations, it is found (§ 6) that, in order to satisfy
the equations, Bo must be equal to the difference between two finite-continued
fractions, each of which involves Bo. We thus have an equation for Bo, and the
required root is that which vanishes when 8 vanishes.

For the harmonies of degrees 0, 1, 2, 3, and for all orders, o may be found
rigorously in algebraic form, but for higher degrees the equation can only be solved
approximately, unless 8 should have a definite numerical value.

When Bo has been determined, either rigorously or approximately, the successive
coefticients of the series are determinable in such a way that the ratio of each
coeflicient to the preceding one is expressed by a continued fraction, which is, in fact,
a portion of one of the two fractions involved in the equation for Bo.

Throughout the rest of the paper the greater part of the work is carried out
with approximate forms, and, although it would be easy to attain to greater
accuracy, Ihave thought it sufticient, in the first instance, to stop at 8°. With this

limitation the coefticients of the series assume simple forms (§ 8), and we have thus
definite, if approximate, expressions for all the functions which can occur in
ellipsoidal analysis.
