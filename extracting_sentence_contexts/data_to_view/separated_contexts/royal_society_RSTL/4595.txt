It is a condition therefore neces-
sary to the wheel not slipping that

If, therefore, taking the maximum value of- in any revolution, we find that f ex-

ceeds it, it is certain that the wheel cannot have slipped in that revolution ; whilst if,
on the other hand, F falls short of it, it must have slipped*. The positions between
which the slipping will take place continually, are determined by solving, in respect
to cos 0,, the equation

The application of these principles to the slip of the carriage-wheel is rendered less
difficult by the fact, that the value of þ is always in that case 80 small, as compared
with the values of k and a, that 2 may be neglected in formulz (34.) and (35.), as com-

pared with unity. Those equations then become

* Of course, the elipping, in the case of the driving-wheels of a locomotive, is diminished by the fact that
