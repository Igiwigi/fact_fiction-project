It is further shown that while whites show a marked sensibility to the influences
which induce the production of F., coloured people are much more influenced by the
forces which stimulate the production of M.

This result is interpreted to mean that as the tendency of whites to produce M. is
normally exercised to a high degree, this race has less power to respond to the
influences which tend to increase the M. output, whereas forces which favour the
production of F. have more effect. For the same reason coloured people, who normally

produce a large proportion of F., most readily respond to those forces which induce
the production of M.

322 MR. W. HEAPE ON THE PROPORTION OF THE SEXES

The force of this reasoning is emphasised by the fact that, when the high birth-
rate persists for two months, whites produce the maximum of F, during the first
month, the influence acts quickly ; while in coloured people the impulse is strongest
in the second month, in other words the tendency is cumulative in their case. 12. The Proportion of the Sexes produced by Legitimate and Illegitimate Unions
at Times of Highest and Lowest Fertility as compared with the Average Pro-
portion.—There is a consistent difference between the proportion of M. born from
legitimate as compared with illegitimate unions, and the inference has been drawn
that the forces which induce that difference act differently in the two races.
