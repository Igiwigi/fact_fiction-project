444 MR. P. H. GOSSE ON THE STRUCTURE, FUNCTIONS, AND HOMOLOGIES

will appear by a comparison of the figures 66 and 72, while I have already proved the
essential identity of the former with the structure in Brachionus, &c.

118. We are now arrived at the most aberrant forms of the RoTIFgra, the genera
Floseularia and Stephanoceros. In the former (figs. 79 to 82), the position of the dental
apparatus is even more abnormal than its 8tructure. The teeth appear to be enclosed
in no mas/az, and are placed far down in the abdominal cavity ; nearer to the cloaca,
in fact, than to the flower-like disk. I will endeayour to explain this.

119. The whole of the upper part of this elegant animal's body is lined with a
yery <ensitive, contractile, partially-opake membrane, which, a little below the disk,
recedes from the walls of the body, and forms a diaphragm with a highly contractile,
and versatile central orifice. At some distance lower down another diaphragm occurs,
and the ample chamber thus enclosed forms a kind of crop, or receptacle for the cap-
tured prey. Below the second diaphragm is another capacious chamber, which we
must consider as a stomach, since digestion evidently commences in it, and it opens
into the intestine.

120. The mastar, as I have above stated, is wholly wanting ; the dental apparatus,
which is very small, evidently springing from the common paries of the stomach,
