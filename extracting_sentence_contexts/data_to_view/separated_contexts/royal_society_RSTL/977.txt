Du Har has shewn, that the bark of some species of
trees is readily reproduced, when the decorticated surface of
the alburnum is secluded from the air; and I have repeated
similar experiments on the apple, the sycamore, and other
trees, with the same result; I have also often observed a
similar reproduction of bark on the surface of the alburnum
of the JVych elm (Ulmus montana) # shady situations, when
no covering whatever was applied. A glareous fluid, as Du
HamtL has stated, exudes from the surface of the alburnum :
this fluid appears to change into a pulpous unorganised mass,
which subsequently becomes organised and cellular; and the

matter, which enters into the composition of this cellular
substance, is evidently derived: from the alburnum. These facts are therefore extremely favourable to the
theory of HaLes ; but other facts may be adduced which
are 'scarcely consistent with that theory. 'Fhe internal surface of pieces of bark, when detached from
contact with the alburnum, provided they remain united to the
tree at their upper ends, much more readily generate a new
bark, than the alburnum does under similar circumstances: a
similar fluid exudes from the surfaces of both, and the same
phenomena are observable in both cases. The cellular sub-
stance, however, which is thus generated, though it presents
every external appearance of a perfect bark, is internally very
imperfectly; organized; and the vessels which contain the
true sap in the bark, are till wanting; and I have found,
that these may be made, by appropriate management, to
traverse the new cellular substance in almost any direction.
