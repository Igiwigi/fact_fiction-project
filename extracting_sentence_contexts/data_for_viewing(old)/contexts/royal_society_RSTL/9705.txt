hollow ramifications (see Plate 68, figs. 2 and 3). In order to see these well in
sections of hardened glands it is necessary that the sections should be thick, and then
by careful focussing, the vesicles with their usual contents can be traced ramifying both
upwards and downwards, and Iaterally in all directions. In the glands of numerous
other Dogs of different ages I have ascertained with equal certainty that the vesicles
present very few, if any, ramifications. When the vesicles present these branches,
the intervals between them form the inflexions projecting into the interior of the
vesicles, which have been already described by VeRs0N (0p. cit., p. 371) and myself
(op. cit., p. 560). I have examined fresh portions of the glands of young Sheep in salt
folution and in MiLrer's fluid (according to the method recommended by Zriss for
floating out the tubes), but have obtained no appearances that might not be produced
by the much-branched vesicles just described in the thyroid glands of young Dogs. In
fact, there can be no doubt that these are the game structures as those which Zeiss

obtained by flotation. Our observations also agree, inasmuch as Zpss observed these
tubes in the glands of young animals : at leas6 he makes no statement to the effect
that they have been found in the glands of adult animals. From the fact of their
complete, or almost entire, absence in the glands of adult Dogs, T regard these mnch-
branched vesicles merely as forming a stage in the growth of the organ, and consider
that in its fully developed state the gland-vesicles form cavities more or less spherical
