life descended from more than a single ancestor, it is clear, on the other, that that single ancestor
should possess everything that is shared by extant life, not least the ribosome and the rest of the
apparatus of genetic-code-driven protein synthesis.

Much of the evolution of LUCA has been clarified in light of the discovery that even distantly
related organisms can directly exchange genetic material via horizontal gene transfer (HGT).
Indeed, the past 20 years have seen an increased interest in the fact that (mostly) Bacteria and
Archaea can perform HGT, by means of which they transfer genes conferring antibiotic resistance
and the ability of metabolize alternative sources of carbon and energy. The role of HGT becomes,
however, more controversial in the study of the evolution of early life, as it led to question the
very foundation of the tree-like structure of the evolutionary relationship among species [29]. In
fact, the key assumption for constructing phylogenetic trees is that similarities between genes
(or genomes) allow one to infer the parent-to-offspring relationship among organisms. In this
way, in a phylogenetic tree based on a gene that was horizontally transferred, two dissimilar
species would appear closely related. A way to address this issue is to note that (at present time)
HGT shapes mostly accessories part of the genomes, that is, genes that are not involved in vital
organismal functions. By contrast, core genes such as the 16S rRNA evolve (slower) by vertical
descent and are weakly, or not at all, affected by HGT. The reason is that core genes underwent
strong coevolution and are thus much more interdependent on the rest of the genome. Therefore,
transferring a core gene would most likely have lethal consequences for the recipient cell.
