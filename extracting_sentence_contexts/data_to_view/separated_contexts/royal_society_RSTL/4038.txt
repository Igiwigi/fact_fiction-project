On leaving the circle closed for some minutes,
the ordinary phenomena—the opposite of the preceding—appear ; that is to say, the
direct limb contracts on closing, and the inverse limb on breaking the circle. It is
very difficult to reproduce these phenomena in the same frogs, on account of the
extreme feebleness produced by the numerous contractions. The above fact establishes a fresh connection between neryous influence and the
passage of the electric current according to the direction of the latter, I will return
to this subject in the general views which I announced above. Pisa, December 1846.
