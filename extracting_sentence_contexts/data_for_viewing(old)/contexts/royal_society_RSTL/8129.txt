puted results with measures of wave-lengths by AxGsrroM and DrescniNes, and I found
that the discordances were far larger than I had anticipated. I remarked, however,
* By means of the comparison ..... there is no difficulty in computing for any other line
the correction that ought to be applied to the wave-length in the principal Tables, in
order to exhibit the true wave-lengths on D1TsCHEISER's scale, without appreciable
error,”

Want of leisure long prevented me from entering upon the examination necessary for
preparing, in a form easy for applications, the correction which my numbers required.
Lately, however, I have taken it up; and I have constructed a Table of corrections to
the numbers of my Table generally, and I have applied them, both to the general Table
of wave-lengths and to the values of wave-lengths for the spectral lines of the atmo-
sphere and several metals (the accurate exhibition of which was, in fact, the first object
of my computations). I now offer these corrections and corrected numbers for the
acceptance of the Royal Society.

The work of comparison and correction was conducted by a graphical process. For
this, I refer to the diagram (Plate X1I.), premising the following explanations :—The
abscissa-measures are the computed numbers for Wave-lengths in the Philosophical
Transactions, 1868. The Ordinate-measures are the corrections required to make
these computed numbers agree with observed wave-lengths. The crosses represent the
corrections required by AxegrrO0M; and the dots represent the corrections required by
DiTsCHEINER.

My first step was, adopting my computed numbers as a line of absciss, to mark the
