Now, as in the case of freezing-point depression,
so here, having shown previously that solution volume is a linear function of ionic
volume, we deduce that the equivalent refractive power, which is shown above to be
a linear function of ionic volume, must therefore also be a linear function of solution
volume. The series of values given by DinkHAuser for KCl is not sufficiently good
to make this comparison useful. But the series for NaCl shows clearly the remark-
able fact that the equivalent refractive power is accurately a linear function of the
solution volume right through the range of dilute and concentrated solutions. In Table XXXI. are set out the solution volumes, calculated from the density data

given by DinkHAvseER,* the values of the equivalent refractive power as given by
him, together with the values calculated from the linear relation
An/m = 0°01643—0°0215 V,. Tt will be seen that the difference between observed and calculated values nowhere
exceeds more than a unit in the last place of decimals, from a concentration of
one-tenth normal to five times normal.
