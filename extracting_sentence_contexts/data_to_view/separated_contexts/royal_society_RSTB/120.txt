Deaths from phthisis do not usually occur much under
20 years of age, tubercular disease under that age usually taking other forms. Now
those living in 1-roomed houses, and who would be most liable to be attacked by
phthisis, have been already killed off at a much earlier age by diarrhea, acute bron-
chitis, broncho-pneumonia, tubercular meningitis, ete. ; hence the smaller death-rate
from phthisis in 1- and 2-roomed houses. In fact, the diseases just mentioned may be
almost considered as the complement of phthisis, so that as the one increases the total
of the others diminishes, but less rapidly : their sum, therefore, still shows a marked
increase from 4- to 1-roomed houses. Number of rooms.

Were only the cases of diarrhoea occurring during childhood included in the first
category, the above figures would become still more striking.

(5.) The considerable increase in acute bronchitis, broncho-pneumonia, etc., as we
pass from 4- to 1-roomed houses, fully confirms, though in a different way, previous
observations as to the effect of impure air in promoting pulmonary diseases. A very
conclusive example of this is given in the report by Deputy Surg.-General Stpson
(and quoted in Parxkus’ ‘ Hygiene,’ 6th edit., p. 135) on the health of the South
Afghanistan field-force during the time they wintered at Candahar in 1880-81.

(6.) Of those diseases which are usually considered infectious, measles, hooping-
cough, and diphtheria (including croup) are the only ones for which there are sufficient
deaths to allow a conclusion to be drawn.
