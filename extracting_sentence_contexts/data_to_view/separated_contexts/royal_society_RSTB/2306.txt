ESCOMBE ON STATIC DIFFUSION OF

approximately represent equal differences of pressure of the atmospheric CO,,
and also the lines of flow perpendicular to them.*

These shells must vary in density outwards from zero at the absorbent surface,
if this is perfectly absorbent, to a density corresponding to the maximum pressure
of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a point which theoretically is at infinite
distance from the disc, but which is practically reached at a distance of five or six
times its diameter. If we had two such figures of different sizes, drawn to relative
seale, one in fact the magnified image of the other, any curved surface corresponding
to a given density would be found at actual distances from the dises which would be
proportional to their diameters. This, of course, means that the gradient of density,
on the magnitude of which the flow into unit area depends, must vary inversely as
the diameters of the discs, a result sufficient to account for all the observed facts. The case of such an absorbent disc as we have been considering is the exact
converse of one which has been theoretically explored by Sreran (â€˜ Wien. Akad.
