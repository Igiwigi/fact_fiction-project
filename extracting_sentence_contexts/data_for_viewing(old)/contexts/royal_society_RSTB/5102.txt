vertically in the skull ; its anterior border is embayed by a wide notch, above which it
is produced into a blunt process directed forward. It is immediately succeeded by
another bone of the same series, which rests on the upper edge of the quadrate ramus
of the pterygoid ; this has a deep incision in its upper border, which must have trans-
mitted the second and third branches of the fifth nerve. This element is succeeded by
two more, which fill up the space between it and the quadrate. The quadrate itself
is a comparatively large element, attached by the whole of its admedian surface to the
outer side of the quadrate ramus of the pterygoid, along which it is drawn out into a
short but quite definite pterygoid ramus; the mass of the bone stands transversely in
the skull, its outer face being in contact with the pre-operculum and the quadrate jugal,
and the whole of its lower margin forming a well-finished articular condyle.

The series of bones just described I shall call the suprapterygoids. The fact that they
include the epipterygoid and the quadrate shows that they are ossifications in the palato-
quadrate cartilage, and they form the only known instance of a complete replacement
of that element by cartilage bones. That they are indeed substitution bones is fortunately
confirmed by their structure. In Megalichthys the membrane bones are very massive,
and are preserved in the Newsham shale in their full thickness and quite uncrushed.
The cartilage bones, on the other hand, are feeble, consisting only of a thin superficial
layer supported by a set of bony spicules; when preserved in the shale such bones are
always crushed flat, the spicules showing through as low projections on the surface.

The shapes, numbers, and relations of these suprapterygoid bones are fixed by the
following series of specimens :â€”
