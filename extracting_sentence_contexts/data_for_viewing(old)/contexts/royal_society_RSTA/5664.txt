operate in real time. Hence, this DT can be described as a two-level DT, where a DTI for MPC
of autonomous landing (AL) is wrapped around an innovative, real-time DTP (RT-DTP) for FSI
(figure 1). The design of this DT features three innovations that constitute the main contributions
of this paper: the formulation of the governing coupled FSI equations in an arbitrary Lagrangian—
Eulerian (ALE) setting and their linearization about a pre-designed glideslope trajectory, rather
than a mere equilibrium point, albeit using a reasonable simplifying assumption; the construction
of a linearized, computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based, fluid projection-based reduced-
order model (PROM) [17] and its coupling with a linearized six-degrees-of-freedom (6-d.f.)
representation of the rigid dynamics of the UAV; and the training of the resulting FSI PROM
for any deflection of any of the UAV’s control surfaces. Hence, in this work, the UAV is assumed
to be sufficiently stiff to justify its representation by a 6-d.f. rigid body, equipped with deployable
control surfaces. This assumption is appropriate, as it is satisfied by many UAVs, particularly in
the context of landing. Linearization is also justified by the fact that the controller can be expected



to maintain the UAV within small perturbations about a pre-designed glideslope, except if it 4 |
has to deal with an exogenous event just before touchdown—a scenario that is not considered

in this work. On the other hand, linearization about a steady-state equilibrium point would 3
not be effective in this case, because the fluid state at such a point is time-dependent. For this oS
reason, a more suitable linearization is performed instead. As for relying on a low-dimensional, : gS
