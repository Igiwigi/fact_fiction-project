question, the record is of less importance from this point of view ; whilst in some of
the animal matters carbonates doubtless exist as 8nch. But, as in other cages it is
important to include the carbonic acid among the constituents of the pure ash, it is
included here also for the sake of uniformity of plan.

It is freely admitted that results relating to carbonic acid require very careful con-
8ideration, if misinterpretation is to be avoided. Not that the determination of the
amount of it actually existing in an ash is a matter of difficulty in experienced hands ;
but, according to the character of the ash, and to the conditions of the incineration,
more or less of the carbonates may have been converted into more fixed salts, or the
carbonic acid may be expelled and the ash causticised.

I is in fact very difficult, if not impossible, with some descriptions of ash, such for
example as contain much silica, or phosphates with less than three of fixed base, 80 to
conduct the incineration as to retain what may be termed the normal amount of car-
bonie acid. Indeed, after an ash has been kept for some time, and has acquired water,
and perhaps regained carbonie acid, it is in some cases extremely difficult finally to
heat it before weighing out for analysis, 80 as to ensure, on the one hand the expvlsion
of all water, and on the other the retention of the normal amount of carbonic acid.
These points have been very fully investigated in connexion with the analyses of
about 700 ashes, of various products, of known history, prepared at, Rothamsted.

In the ashes of the mixed animal matters the amount of carbonic acid is in all cases
mall ; but the differences in the amounts obtained according to the methods of pre-
paration for analysis well illustrate the difficulties involved. Thus, in five of the
