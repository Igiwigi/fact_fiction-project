DR. PHILIP ON THE NATURE OF DEATH. 185

vital properties to the sensitive parts of the brain and spinal marrow, and by their
capability of being excited by inanimate agents to the world which surrounds us,
form the links which connect and enable to conduce to one end the operations of the
sensitive organs, namely, the immediate organs of the sensorial powers, and the ope-
rations of inanimate nature ; two classes of operations which have nothing in com-
mon. Let us here pause to consider more particularly the positions stated in this
paragraph.

However repugnant it may be to our preconceived opinions, we shall, I think, when
the whole of the facts on the subject are carefully weighed, find it impossible to avoid
the conclusion, that all the vital functions, and all those functions of the sensitive
system by which the sensorial powers influence and are influenced by the external
world, are the results of inanimate agents acting on living parts, or living parts on
them. Such, as far as I am capable of judging, must be the conclusion, if we com-
pare the results of experiments, an account of which has been laid before the Society,
and published in their Transactions *, with observations too simple to require any
illustration from experiment. :

With regard to the first of these classes, the vital functions, it is evident that the
functions of the alimentary canal are excited by the food, of the lungs by the air, and
of the heart and blood-vessels by the stimulating contents of the blood.
