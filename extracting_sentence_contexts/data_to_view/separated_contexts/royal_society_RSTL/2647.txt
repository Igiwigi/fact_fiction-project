March 28. Gurgitello, Ischia (taken in a sort of well, into which it rises), 149. I shall conclude by recapitulating in a tabular form the final results obtained in
this paper, and which it may be hoped are adapted for future reference as ascertained
scientific facts. I have much satisfaction in being able to snbjoin, through the
kindness of M. Araco, a series of unpublished observations which he made in 1826
on several of the hot springs of France, by a thermometer whose indications are re-
duced to the true scalef.
