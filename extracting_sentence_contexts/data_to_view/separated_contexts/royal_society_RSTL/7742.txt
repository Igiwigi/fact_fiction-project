And eyen now, after the most careful employment of the soft s0ap and
Hot water, the first charge of pure nitric, or of pure hydrochloric acid often developes a
blue and exceedingly delicate actinic cloud. As regards the optical question, these irre-
gular clouds exhibit some of the finest effects. One additional fact will illustrate a class
of disturbances already touched upon. Pure nitric acid had been proved over and over
again to exhibit no visible action; but after having demonstrated its inertness, a case
occurred where it produced rather dense actinic clouds five times in succession. Indeed
there seemed to be no end to their possible development.
