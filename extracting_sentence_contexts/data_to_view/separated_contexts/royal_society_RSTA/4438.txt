High-pressure CO can expand the organic solvents
[29], which can enhance the dissolution of the H2 and improve the efficiency of the reactions [30]. In our work, an increase in CO? pressure could increase the concentrations of Hz and CO2, which
may be one of the main reasons for the enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity for C2, alcohols. The results in table 2 also demonstrate that the higher Hz pressure enhanced the reactivity mainly
due to the fact that the solubility of H2 in the liquid is higher at a higher H2 pressure.

(c) Reusability of the catalyst and hot filtration test

The reusability of the Pt;Ru2/Fe2O3 catalyst was tested. In this experiment, the catalyst was
separated from the reaction mixture by a centrifugation method after the reaction, and was
used for the next run after it had been washed and dried. The results are shown in figure 5.
