preferable. I give a microscopic section of Heptastylis (fig. 75) for comparison of its

calyces, and which can with ample justice be compared with younger types among
the Poritide.

One fact still deserves to be mentioned about Astreomorpha, since I have not yet
seen it in published descriptions. It is that in many calyces there are traces of
bilateral symmetry in the arrangement of the septa. Sometimes a main septum is

radial in their symmetry.

The above considerations lead me to entirely split up the sub-family Pseudo-
