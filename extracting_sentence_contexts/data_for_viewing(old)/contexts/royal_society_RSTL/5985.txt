Is a contribution to the Philosophical 'Fransactions of this Society, published in 1852
(Part 11. p. 289), I gave an account of the internal anatomy of the stem or rhizome of
& Vietoria regia. TI then stated that I regarded the arrangement of the vascular structures
Sas exxentially agreeing with that typical in Monocotyledons, and I directed attention to
Scertain points of less importance, some of which appeared to strengthen the general
Fargument in question, while others were opposed to it. Subsequently I have had an
S pportunity of studying the anatomy and development of the leaves, roots. and flowers
DSof Victoria, and of observing some interesting facts which have not been clearly made
But in any of the various memoirs which have appeared on this subject. I have als

Syhich appeared in the + Flora Indica” (p. 236), the distinguished authors of which, in

Z In the present paper, which may be regarded as a continuation and completion of the
Former, I hall first deal with the debated question of the structure of the rhizome, and
Jifterwards give an account of the development of the appendicular organs, including the
Flower, and of the phenomena presented in the germination of the seed. For the abso-
Jute determination of the question whether a stem were organized on the Monocotyle-
Alonous or the Dicotyledonous type, it would be requisite first of all to define clearly what
