To simulate self-organization processes as best as possible, one has to
take into account the effect of random perturbations in a dynamical system, where the interplay
between nonlinearity and stochasticity can cause many unexpected phenomena [20-24]. Among
them, we should mention noise-induced phase transitions [25-29] and stochastically forced self-
organization [13,30,31]. Despite the fact that noise is caused by random processes, it often helps
to establish a relative order in dynamical systems. Since respective models for studying self-
organization are nonlinear and stochastic, analytical approaches are quite limited; therefore,
asymptotic computational methods should be used [32]. In the present paper, we study the nonlinear predator-prey dynamical model [33,34].
