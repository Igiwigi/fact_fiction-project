cannot be linked to budding or to basal disk formation. There-
fore, we suspect that DMBX1/manacle may play unsuspected
roles linked to the adaptation of epithelial cells to the loss of
neurogenesis in Hydra.

4. Conclusion and perspectives

This study shows that the loss of neurogenesis in Hydra
directly impacts the surrounding epithelial cells by modify-
ing the genetic programmes they express. By crossing the
information obtained in three types of transcriptomic
approaches, spatial along the body column, cellular on
three distinct FACS-sorted cell populations, and pharmaco-
logical in animals exposed to drugs or heat-shock, we
identified 25 genes expressed in epithelial cells of the neuro-
genic body column in homeostatic conditions, which exhibit
a minimal twofold up-regulation in the contexts where neu-
rogenesis was inactivated (figure 6). This up-regulation is
steadily increasing over 11 days following HU treatment
