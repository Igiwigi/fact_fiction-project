behaviour, as the AH-POA is important for male sexual

displays [64] and the VMH is critical for female receptivity
[65]. However, in the parthenogens, both brain regions are
equivalent in volume in fadrozole-treated individuals with
testes and unmanipulated lizards with ovaries [62]. These
results raise the possibility that sex differences in the brains
of whiptail lizards are controlled by sex chromosome com-
plement rather than organization by gonadal steroids. Data

The results of manipulating availability of BDNF and trkB availability across the two whiptail species suggest that the

BDNF is transported from HVC to RA, where it induces in development and that both this steroid hormone and factors

intrinsic to the tissues are important. Specifically, while
the AH-POA and VMH do not change in size across reproduc-
tive states in females of the sexual species (C. inornatus) or
the parthenogen (C. uniparens), both are demasculinized/

in this region in males. However, infusion of BDNF into
this region in females facilitates the recruitment and survival
of new neurons. T-treatment of females also increases BDNF
expression [52]. In adult male canaries, singing increases
the survival of these new cells within HVC, as well as
