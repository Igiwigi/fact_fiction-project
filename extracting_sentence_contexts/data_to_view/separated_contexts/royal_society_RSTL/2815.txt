In order to obtain satisfactory proof of the difference in the structure of the brain
in the marsupial and placental quadruped, I dissected and compared together,
step by step, the brains of a Wombat and Beaver. These animals, as is well known,
are of nearly similar bulk, and manifest 80 many mutual affinities in their structure,
