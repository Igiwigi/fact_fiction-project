A. tendinous inscription exists in
most of the Vespertilionine Bats; I found none either in the Pteropine or Phyllosto-
mous 8pecies, while in Rhinolophus the sterno-hyoid is narrow, and presents nothing

are large and strong, especially the stylo-glossus, which passes as usual from the stylo-
hyal bone to the side of the base of the tongue. Digastrie (Plate XIII. fig. 8, c, 4) in the Vespertilionine Bats is a simple one-bellied
depressor of the mandible, extending to the middle third of the ramus, and largest pro-
