eventually, will augment human capabilities. Technologies like deep brain stimulation
and optogenetics are still closer to science fiction than science in terms of concrete
applications for mental augmentation. They are used in experiments with animals and
deep brain stimulation, and in some trials for reducing symptoms of Parkinson disease.

It will take several more years before these, or new technologies result in seamless mental
augmentation. Brain-computer interfaces are also being used, most of the time in communication
from the brain to a machine like controlling a robotic arm.”

Even without taking into consideration ‘potential’ but science fiction-like technologies, the
trend towards human augmentation is accelerating. Natural language interfaces on the one
side and the growing capabilities of machines to interpret the context including image/gesture
recognition, emotion detection, singling out of a voice among several are accelerating the seamless
cooperation of humans and machines and eventually result in the birth of a symbiotic system,
what has been called by the SAS initiative symbiotic autonomous systems.

4. Digital twins and personal digital twins

The concept of a DT goes back to the first years of this century. It was devised as a mirror in the
cyberspace of a physical entity and as such it was adopted in the manufacturing world. At its
root, it consists of three components:
