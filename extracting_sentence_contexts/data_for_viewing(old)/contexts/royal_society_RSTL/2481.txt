through the intermediate form of Zoea; I have now to announce that they undergo
another metamorphose, no less singular and unlooked for, in which they assume the
form of the genus designated by the name of Megalopa by Dr. Leacn, from the dis-
proportionate size of the eyes. This second stage we may therefore consider analo-
gous to that of pupa in the class Insecta.

By the former memoir it appears that the young of Cancer Pagurus, the common
market Crab, first presents itself as a Zoe *, and that a full-grown Zoe was observed
passing into some other more perfect form , which at that time was considered to
be that of some species of Crab : the discovery now first detailed, however, shows
that it must have been only passing into that of a Megalope.

The first proof I had of this new and extraordinary fact, which cancels another
anomalous genus of the Crustacea, was obtained by keeping in regularly renewed sea-
water a number of individuals of a Megalope { which makes its appearance in the
river Lee, just below the city of Cork, in considerable abundance every summer :
these, to my very great surprise, began, after a short time, to change into a mi-
nute Crab \, until the whole of them, to the amount of about two dozen, were 80
metamorphosed. TI have frequently since observed the same circumstance, and came
to the conclusion that these must be the progeny of the only Crab that is ever found
in the higher parts of the river, where these Megalope were taken, viz. Carcinus Manas,
our common Shore Crab. The young Crab, it will be noticed, has not the distinctive
characters of its parent, which it probably acquires only after several casts of its
$helly covering.
