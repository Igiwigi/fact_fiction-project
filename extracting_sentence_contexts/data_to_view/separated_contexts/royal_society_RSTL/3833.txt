I found this arrangement answer very well for a few hundred series, but when the
number was augmented, and the battery completed, the insulation was sadly deficient. This induced me to take the battery asunder, and to have distinct or separate glass
vessels made for each pair. After again completing the entire series, I found the
insulation was even less efficient than before; for from the glass attracting moisture
from the atmosphere, as well as from the eyaporation of the battery, each cell became
a conductor, and scarcely any effect could be produced on the electroscope; in fact,
it was not until I had finally adopted the arrangements I have previously described,
that any approximation to a tolerable insulation could be maintained. 7. The general appearance of the battery may be seen by referring to Plate I.
