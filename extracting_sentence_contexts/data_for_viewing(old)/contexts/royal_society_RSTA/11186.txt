avoided, a strict applicability of Ohm’s law. In the case of salt vapours this law
only applies for low electromotive forces. This was found both by ARRHENTUS and
ourselves. ARRHENIUS, from theoretical considerations, believes that Ohm’s law
should hold also for higher electromotive forces, and he concludes that the divergence
from it must be regarded as only apparent. This, however, leaves the divergence
entirely unexplained.

For an expression capable of representing the relationship between current strength
and electromotive foree we were led, as already stated, to a formula derived by
Professor J. J. Tomson and Mr. Ruruerrorp from their study of the conductivity
of gases subjected to Réntgen rays. In a gas exposed to Réntgen rays a steady
supply of ions is supposed to be generated and the resulting concentration of ions is
then determined by the fact that the rate at which they combine is proportional to
the square of the number present, assuming equal numbers of positive and negative
ions to be distributed throughout the gas. In a flame containing salt vapour it may
be supposed that a steady supply of ionising salt is carried up between the electrodes,
so that the conditions would be, to this extent, analogous in the two cases.

In applying the formula to our results we have had to recognise a feature dis-
tinguishing the behaviour of salt vapours from that of Réntgenised gases, namely, the
fact that the current strength continues to rise slowly even at high E.M.F.s. The
explanation of this difference does not seem to be difficult.* It would be accounted
for by the increased electrostatic field either bringing in ions from the neighbourhood
of the electrodes or increasing the rate of ionisation between them.
