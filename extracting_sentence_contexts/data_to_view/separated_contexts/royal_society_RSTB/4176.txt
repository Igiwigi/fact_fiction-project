Meckel’s cartilage is a curved rod which passes
without distinction into the malleus (mal.). This, as will be seen in fig. 4, is a
thickening forming the head of the malleus and the manubrium, which at this stage is
mainly procartilage. A comparison of the ventral views of the models of the three stages (Plate 29, fig. 3 ;
Plate 30, fig. 11; Plate 32, fig. 22) reveals the fact that the Meckel’s cartilages of the
youngest are very much bowed. In the older stages they dre very much straighter
and even become curved inwards, forming a long symphysis. An explanation of this
developmental change might be that the widely separated condition of the younger
stages allows of a firmer hold on the teat.
