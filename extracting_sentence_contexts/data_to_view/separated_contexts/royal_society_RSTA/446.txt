In fact, the results concerning the region of existence of rolling-grain
ripples and vortex ripples in the parameter space are only marginally affected by the uniform
steady streaming. On the other hand, it is interesting to look at the O(8) correction of the value of
ow predicted by Vittori & Blondeaux [17], because O(5) terms in ow cause qualitative changes
in the bottom profile. In fact, 7 is no longer symmetric with respect to the crests and the troughs,
because co) has an imaginary part of O(5). Figure 5 shows the equilibrium profile of the ripples
obtained by means of the theory for fixed values of the parameters along with that obtained
neglecting O(5) effects. The characteristic profile of sea ripples affected by a steady current can be
recognized from the lee side of the ripples being steeper than the stoss side.
