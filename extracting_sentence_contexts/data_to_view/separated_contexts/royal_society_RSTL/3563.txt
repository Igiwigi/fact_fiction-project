At the present
time they did not form independent divisions of the body, but were covered by the
common tegument, and thus appeared like supplementary parts of the seventh seg-
ment, produced from the germinal membrane, and interposed between the seventh
and the penultimate segment (8.), which, as before stated, is a permanent segment
throughout the life of the animal. This latter fact shows that it is not merely by an
elongation and division of the terminal segment that the body of the Iulus is deve-
loped, but that it arrives at its perfect state by an actual production of entirely new
8egments ; that these are new growths or formations which are in progress long be-
fore they are apparent to the eye; and that the original segments of the ovum, into
which the animal is first moulded, are permanent segments throughout its whole life. But till more curious is it, that not only have new segments been formed as de-
scribed, but that the common tegument by which they are now covered, and which
also invests the whole body as the true skin, has already begun to be detached, pre-
paratory to its being thrown off, as is shown in the fact that the new segments are now
seen beneath it; and it is further remarkable, that this deciduation of the first skin
of the animal had actually commenced before the bursting of the amnion. These cir-

cumstances explain the cause of the very quiescent state of the young Tulus, and its
almost, and perhaps entire abstinence from food while this skin remains on its body. It is not until this skin is thrown off that the new segments become elongated, and
the Iulus then appears suddenly to have acquired six new divisions to its body.
