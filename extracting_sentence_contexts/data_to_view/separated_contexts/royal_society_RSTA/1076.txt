chiefly by X-ray methods, of the problem of the molecular structure of animal hairs.
2 The present paper is a natural continuation of the record, in which earlier tentative
m suggestions are either confirmed or rejected, and an attempt is made to lay bare the
oh general structural principles underlying the properties of the protein, keratin. It
a will be unnecessary here to outline once more the historical development of the subject ;
| we shall proceed at once to the main point of this introductory section, which is to give
ie what appears to be the solution of the problem before setting out in detail the experi-
1) mental facts and arguments leading up to it. Such a procedure is advisable because
6 of the complex nature of the properties under discussion ; such a long series of experi-
3 ments have been involved in their elucidation, that without some sort of preliminary
g statement of the chief conclusions, the issue is apt to grow confused. Pa Briefly, the whole argument rests on the discovery} that the X-ray “fibre photo-
= graph” which appears to be common to all mammalian hairs, human hair, wool,
s whalebone, nails, horn, porcupine quills, etc., and which is undoubtedly the diffraction
& pattern of crystalline, or pseudo-crystalline, keratin, the common fibre substance
i of all these biological growths, is changed into a quite different fibre photograph when
z the hair is stretched.
