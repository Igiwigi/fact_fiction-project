The ferrous alloy No. 3731 has,
however, remained practically unaltered, and the percentage elongation of Duralumin
is only slightly reduced. For each of these six materials there is a very definite fall
in the reduction of area. Thus for these materials the fact observed at liquid air
temperature is confirmed at this lower temperature of liquid hydrogen. The two materials, No. 3450 and phosphor bronze, show, however, the reverse effect,
namely, an increase in their reduction of area figure, although their percentage
elongation is reduced by about one-third in liquid hydrogen. Effects on Tenacity.â€”While, in accordance with observations at liquid air and other
sub-normal temperatures, the general effect is seen to be an increase in tenacity at the
temperature of liquid hydrogen, there are important changes.
