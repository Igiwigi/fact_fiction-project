[4732301] 2066 (4734367) 17897 (1) 47522°64

The [ ] in the second column are calculated from the first column by adding 20°65.
The line in (_) is determined as the mean of the linked lines u.(1) 47784°02 = ... 44°55
and (1) 46183°62.1.e = ... 42°80, As 58 on the limit produces a separation of 20°65,
the lines in the second column would correspond to the parallel displaced series
(—58) Dj. The separations of the last column increase with the order to a normal
value of », and point to a constant displacement in the sequent.

With the above D set should be associated a doublet F series whose F, («) = d,, (1)
= 51731°03—23899'08 = 27831°95 and separation that of the D satellite or 1165. In
searching for this allowance will have to be made for the prevalence of displacement
in the lower orders. As a fact, however, this only appears for m = 3 in F,, although in
F, there are considerable signs of it. The following table with succeeding notes
contains the data, including also those for the corresponding F series ; also for certain
lines which show a separation about 150, and which may probably be the analogue of
the 1864 X series.

We shall denote this last set by dashing the letters.

The formula obtained from the two first F, lines and the given limit is

n = 27831°95-N / {m-+797701+ “oossaa
