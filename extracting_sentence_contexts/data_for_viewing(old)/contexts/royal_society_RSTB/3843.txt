long, in which the integument just protrudes beyond the outer envelope (fig. 2).
Hypotheses built on the fact that lateral lobes of the compressed envelopes, both outer
and inner, are indicative of component leafâ€™ members of a presumably decussate system,
of which the median members have therefore been lost, are wholly speculative and
serve no useful purpose. Nothing can be gained by trying to force all facts into a

decussate scheme, in order to homologise the staminate and ovulate flowers : in fact a
much wider view of the possibilities of Welwitschia is gained when decussate con-
struction is entirely eliminated as a non-essential detail.

The archesporial cell is indicated at an early date, usually being recognisable from
the first. A similar archesporium in the apical growing point of the cone was found
in all specimens examined, and may be taken as the rule (PEARSON, 1908).

The archesporium remains very definitely at a level just above the origin of the
inner envelope. Subsequent intercalary growth in the region below it delimits two
regions in the nucellus : (1) An upper pyriform portion enclosed by the integument,
above the developing endosperm ; and (2) a basal region which contains most of the
endosperm, and extends with its growth to an ovoid shape, as the body of the nucellus
