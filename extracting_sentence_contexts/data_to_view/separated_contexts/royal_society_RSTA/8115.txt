OsnEn’s Investigation.
9. It thus appears that Keivin’s researches must be regarded as having failed
to demonstrate stability even for infinitesimal disturbances, although they make this
conclusion probable. Since the difficulty, according to the argument just given, arises
solely from the fact that (22) is not compatible with the satisfaction of both boundary
conditions throughout all time, it evidently lies in the unknown action of the boundaries,
from which vorticity must be conducted” into the fluid (this is the physical explanation
of the necessity of a supplementary solution) in order that the boundary conditions may
be satisfied. Krxvin’s investigation fails because it omits to study the details of this
boundary conduction. The same objection applies to an investigation by Oswen, in which a solution of (14)
is obtained in the form*
