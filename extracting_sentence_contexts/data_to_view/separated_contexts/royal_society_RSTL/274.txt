From these observations, we are entitled to conclude, that
the mystery of the polarisation of the two pencils formed by
double refraction is completely removed by a reference to a
more general principle, and that the formation of two images
and the oblique refraction at a perpendicular incidence are the
only parts of the problem which now require a solution. From the view which has just been given of the nature and
consequences of the polarisation of light by oblique refraction,
you will readily-see that the prosecution of these experiments
will lead to results of still higher interest. The establisghment
of a new law must at all times be considered as an important
step in the progress of science, but when this law presides
over a class of facts, all of which are unexplained, and many
of which still remain to be discovered, it claims a higher regard
both as an instrument of discovery, and as a principle for ex-
plaining new and analogous phenomena. If this paper shall meet with your approbation, and that of
