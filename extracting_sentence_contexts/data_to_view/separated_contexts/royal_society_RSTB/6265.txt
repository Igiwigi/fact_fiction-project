During fixation, the secretion appears to remain undistorted, and it exhibits no
visible variation with all the fluids used in this investigation (cf. the albumen). These facts, taken in conjunction with the viscosity of the secretion in the free state,
suggest that the secretion is quite different from albumen. It must be noted,
however, that the appearance of the glands at any secretory stage in the isthmus
is closely similar, after Zenker-formol fixation, to the single resting phase of the
albumen glands, Â¢f. fig.
