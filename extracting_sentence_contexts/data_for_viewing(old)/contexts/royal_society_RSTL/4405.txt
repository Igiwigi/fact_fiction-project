proof whatever of a specific and still less of a generic distinction ; otherwise the first
sacral vertebra, which is more decidedly quadrate, if found separate, would be
equally entitled to a generic value ; but its association, in the sacrum from Mr. SauLL's
collection (Plate XXVI.), with other vertebral bodies of a very dissimilar character,
and with the ilium of the Ignanodon, preyents our falling into an error of such
magnitude. We may therefore reasonably conclude, that these vertebre, to wit,
Nos. 2133, 2155, belong to the Iguanodon, and that the latter, in the form of the body,
approached the first sacral, and was one of the proper lumbar series. The vertebra,
No. 2109, attributed in the above-mentioned report to the (s0-called) second species
of Cetiosaurus found in the Wealden formation (C. brachyurus), is also a posterior
dorsal or lumbar vertebra of the Iguanodon ; the neural arch is much mutilated. The
only other element of the skeleton of that species is a caudal vertebra, No. 2161,
which also belongs to the Iguanodon; being in fact one of the most anterior of the
caudal series, and contrary to the character of the genus to which it was referred, it
presents one of the most interesting and instructive examples of the rough surface on
the sides of the upper aspect of the centrum, left by the removal of the unanchylosed
neural arch. The 80-called Cetiosaurus brevis being thus founded only on two ver-
tebra which belong to the Iguanodon, must be expunged from the list of extinct
reptiles.

The angular posterior caudal vertebre referred in the Report on British Reptiles,
to the Cetiosaurus brevis, I am also inclined to assign to the Iguanodon for the fol-
lowing reasons:â€”1st, a similar vertebra, as far as can be ascertained, exists in the
Maidstone specimen, and in this case an admixture of bones of distinct animals
cannot, eyen be 8uspected; 2ndly, the numerical ratio of the yertebre of this kind
