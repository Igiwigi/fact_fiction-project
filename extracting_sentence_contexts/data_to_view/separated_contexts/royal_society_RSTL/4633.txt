In my paper published in the Philosophical Transactions in 1835 upon the Meteor-
ology of the Deccan, I arrived at the following conclusions :—That HumBoLpT was
mistaken in supposing, upon the authority of HorsBuRrGn, that the diurnal atmo-

spheric tides were suspended during the monsoon in Western India, The fact was
also unquestionably established of the existence of four atmospheric tides within
twenty-four hours, —two diurnal and two nocturnal, each consisting of a maximum
and minimnin tide, and the occurrence of these tides within the same limit hours as
in America and Europe; the greatest mean diurnal oscillations taking place in the
coldest months, and the smallest tides in the damp months of the monsoon in the
Deccan, whilst at Madras the smallest oscillations were in the hottest months : it was
shown also that these tides took place regularly without a single instance of interrap-
tion, whatever the thermometric or hygrometric indications might be, or whatever
the state of the weather, even storms and hurricanes only modifying and not inter-
rupting them. The anomalous fact was also shown of the mean diurnal oscillations
being greater at Poona, at an elevation of 1823 feet, than at the leyel of the sea, in a
lower latitude at Madras or Bombay, while at an elevation greater than Poona, the
mean diurnal oscillations were less than at Poona. It was shown also that the seasons
did not affect the limit hours of the tides ; but it was shown at the same time that
the turning-points of the tides were sometimes irregular; that a tide flowed for a
longer or shorter period, and that there were numerous cases of a stationary state of
the atmosphere at the hours when the tides should turn.
