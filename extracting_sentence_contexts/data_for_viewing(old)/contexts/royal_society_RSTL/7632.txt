This corresponds to 20:1 per cent. of nitrogen. A third and still more simple mode of
obtaining the nitride is that of exposing the trioxide to the action of ammonia gas at a
white heat. It is a remarkable fact, and one of which we know of but two other examples,
that in presence of nitrogen and hydrogen the whole oxygen of an oxide is displaced by
nitrogen.

THE CHLORIDES OF VANADIUM.

L have succeeded in preparing three chlorides of vanadium, viz. (1) vanadium tetra-
chloride, VCl,, (2) vanadium trichloride, VC, (3) vanadium dichloride, VCl,.

(1) Vanadium Tetrachloride, VCl, molecular weight =193:3, vapour-density = 96-6
(H=1).—This chloride is formed as a dark reddish-brown volatile liquid when metallic
vanadium or the mononitride is burnt in excess of chlorine.
