branch was pushing forward in a more active manner than the latter oneâ€”a condition
common enough amongst recent plants, in which one Lycopodiaceous $hoot takes the
lead, whilst others are comparatively quiescent.

At the outset of my study of the Burntisland beds my attention was arrested by the
prevalence, #n every fraqment of the stratum, of broken-up cellular sporangia, indicating
the former existence of very numerous spore-bearing fruits; I also met with immense
numbers of the remarkable bodies represented in Plate XLIV. fig. 27, and which
appeared to me to be caudate macropores. The abundance of these two objects led
me, on visting Burntisland, under the guidance of Mr. Gritys, to make special search
for Lepidostrobi, which we 8oon succeeded in discovering, and at a more recent period
Mr. GrevE has forwarded me additional specimens. They are all of one species, which
fact is important, since it leaves little, if any, room for doubting that they belong to the
same Lepidodendroid plant as that whose stems and branches constitute the great mass
of the deposit.

'The general aspect of longitudinal sections of these strobili is that common to Lepi-
dostrobi. They usually have a diameter of from less than half an inch to nearly an inch ;
each sporangium extends from the central axis to the periphery, exhibiting in the longi-
tudinal sections the form, s0 prevalent amongst these fruits, of an oblong parallelogram.
In one of these sections now before me I count sixteen vertically disposed sporangia in
an inch of the length of the Lepidostrobus. These dimensions approximate closely to
those of the beautiful cone from Burdiehouse figured by Mr. Bixxzy*. Plate XLIV,
fig. 23 represents a transyerse section of one of these cones. The central axis (8) in this
specimen is imperfect, its central yascular bundles having partly disappeared; but there
