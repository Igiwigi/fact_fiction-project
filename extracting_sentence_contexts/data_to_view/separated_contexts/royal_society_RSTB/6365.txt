Such differentiation of the Miillerian ducts as the male monkey may show is as
readily understandable on the basis of this hypothesis as it is on the basis of that
advanced by Wirscut. A corollary of WresNERâ€™s theory, which at the same time is one
of its central supports, is the belief that oestrin cannot act on imperfectly differentiated
structures derived from the Miillerian ducts. This belief is, however, contrary to the
facts presented in this paper,* unless one assumes that the hydatids of Morgagni are
fully differentiated structures. Oestrone stimulates both fibro-muscular and epithelial growth in the hydatids. The response of the fibro-muscular tissue can be regarded as part of a general sensi-
tivity to oestrogenic substances of mesodermal structures derived from the urogenital
ridge and genital cord.
