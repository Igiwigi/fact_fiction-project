The warmth enabled them to fly for
many hours daily. So their up-wind flight became a major geographical trend, given the
steady wind direction. Indeed, the very fact that they often rose well away from the ground
may have aided their up-wind displacement because they were not grounded by small
temporary wind increases. The swarms in Kenya were held closer to the ground which
ensured up-wind orientation when they did fly, but the wind directions were variable,
flying was often interrupted by gusts and daily flying hours were restricted by cold and rain
so that up-wind flying did not create a trend against the prevailing wind. On the contrary,
the cooler, cloudy conditions, given the gusty winds, created a with-wind trend.
