This idea first emerged at the end of the seventeenth
century and has been developed in the area of mathematics throughout the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries in the works of, for example, Liouville, Riemann, Cauchy, Abel, Griinwald
and many others. More recently, by the end of the twentieth century, it turned out that some
physical phenomena are modelled more accurately when fractional calculus is used. There exist
two (in fact three) main definitions of the fractional order integrals, derivatives and differences:
Riemann-Liouville, Caputo and Griinwald-Letnikov [3,14]. Some others are also present in the
literature but are less commonly used in these applications. To be precise, the Riemann-Liouville
and Caputo definitions concern both fractional derivatives and integrals.
