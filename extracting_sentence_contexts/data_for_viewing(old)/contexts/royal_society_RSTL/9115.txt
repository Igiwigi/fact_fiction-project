both sides, but in the adult are clothed on the under surface with a dense brown
tomentum. 'The converse is seen in some to a slight extent, thus Clerodendron
laciniatum, Terminalia Benzoin, and Randia heterophylla have pubescent young
leayes, while in the adult the leaves are glabrous.

As might be expected, when the leaves of young plants are not so perfectly
deyeloped as in the adult, they are often of a more firm and rigid consistence. This
is specially apparent in species yarying according to the firs: type, in which there is
deficiency in parenchymatous tissue, for instance, in Zudia 8es8iliflora and Cariss
Aylopieron ; but it is also apparent in plants varying after different types.

In 17 species then, belonging to as many genera, of 13 natural Orders, the
heterophylly exists ; and it is a fact of great significance that every * one of them
is either endemic or Mascarene only, that is, one fourth of the whole endemic
and Masearene species on the island. Further, on considering the genera, we find
that two of them are endemic, four are Mascarene alone, three extend to Africa,
and of the remainder seyen are cosmopolitan, and one Polynesian.

Our information regarding the variability of the plants of Mauritius and Bourbon
is too slight to enable us to say whethey an equal amount of yariation occurs there.
But certainly some of the Mascarene species, which yary in Rodriguez, present, as
I have already noticed, the same amount and kind of yariation in these islands
though in other cases the heterophylly may not be to such an extent. So that I
think there can be little doubt that the heteromorphism in foliage is a feature of the
whole Mascarene Flora.
