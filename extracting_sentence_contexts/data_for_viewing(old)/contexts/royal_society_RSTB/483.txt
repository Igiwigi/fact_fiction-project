_ The three basi-cranial fontanelles are well shown in a single section (fig. 11) through
the floor of the pituitary fossa. The posterior (p.ber.fo.) is a wide space containing
the notochord; the anterior (a.ber,fo.) is filled with small, close-set cells, and con-
tains the pituitary pedicle (Pty.ped.); the middle (m.ber.fo.) is filled with small-
celled tissue, and contains a narrow canal, in which neither cells nor coagulum can be
seen. Traced ventrad, this canal simply merges into the perichondrium ; traced
dorsad, it breaks up into several canals containing small, deeply-stained cells, which
appear to be leucocytes. The middle portions of the two commissures (« and y),
separating the three fontanelles, are imperfectly chondrified, and a similar non-
cartilaginous area (w) extends on each side across the cartilage, separating the posterior
basi-cranial fontanelle from the carotid foramen.

Taking all these facts into consideration, it appears to me that my former explana-
tion of the basi-cranial fontanelles (1, p. 61), is erroneous ; that the line of junction
between the trabeculz and parachordals is represented by the area w, the longi-
tudinal bands between the fontanelles indicating the plane of fusion of the trabeculee
with one another. Moreover, the cartilage immediately cephalad of w can be traced
ventrad into the ridges (1, p. 64, Plate 11, fig. 126, 7), which form the lateral boundaries
of the posterior basi-cranial fontanelle, whence it would appear that the ridges in
question represent the cornua trabeculae. The resemblance to the early stages of the
Crocodile’s skull is thus very close (3, Plate 63, fig. 4).

Under these circumstances the only explanation I can offer of the middle basi-
cranial fontanelle is that it is an inter-trabecular fissure, due to the imperfect fusion
of the trabeculew, and finally obliterated by their complete concrescence.
