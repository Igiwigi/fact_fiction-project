S If in any experiment the length of the black part of the film increased from (say)
'2 to 0'8 of the whole length of the cylinder, the effective length would be 0'6 ; and
he alteration of pressure is shown by the curve to be from 01 to 0'9, 4.e., 0'8 of the
hole alteration which would be produced if a coloured film became completely black.
If the thicker film displays some black, the effective length of the black in the
thinner film is the difference of the lengths in the two films. It will be observed that
different changes in the pressure may be produced by the same change in the effective
length. Thus dp/dp* is 0:66 or 0'8 according as the length of the black increases
from 0 to 0'6, or from 02 to 0'8 of the whole length of the cylinder.
We now proceed to describe the experiments. It is necessary to do this in con-
Siderable detail, as no two were alike, and the results do not admit of being stated
shortly 8 as to include all facts which might have affected the results.
