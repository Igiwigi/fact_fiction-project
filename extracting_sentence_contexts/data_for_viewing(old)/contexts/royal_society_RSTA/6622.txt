g It is evident that the quickness of the instrument, whatever proportions may be
ogiven to it, will increase as the sensitive plate is diminished in thickness ; and later on
it will be shown that, besides the quickness, the ultimate sensibility, 7.¢., the deviation
for a given rate of radiation, may also be increased as the thickness is diminished. It
may, therefore, be taken as a fact that, the thinner the plate, the more sensitive will
be the instrument. When I began the calculations I did not think it likely that a
plate composed of metals so difficult to work could be made much less than } mm.
thick, and, accordingly, that has been assumed as one starting point. I have found,
however, not the slightest difficulty in producing plates thinner than this, but I have
in what follows taken this quantity as the thickness when wishing to find the nume-

vical values given by the formule.
The next thing to determine upon is the general size of the circuit. If it is made
