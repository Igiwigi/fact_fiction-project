Thus the lines of magnetic force are given by the lines defined by ¥ =¢, w=’,
where c and ce’ are variable parameters. :

Electrical Distribution on an Equilibrium Surface.

17. The surface density at any point of a charged surface on which the electricity
is in equilibrium is found from the fact that the surface-integral of the normal electric
displacement taken over- any closed surface is equal to the quantity of electricity
within ‘that surface. Hence, if E, denote the electric force normal to the surface,
and o the surface density, we have, just as in electrostatics, when there are no
charges inside the surface,

1 ep
vs KE, =o . . ae” . . . . . (79),

since by § 16 the electric force vanishes inside the surface. The above statement refers to the case in which 0 = 0,
When 2 does not vanish, we have instead,

i-K {E, (outside) — E, (inside)j =o. . . . . - (80),

where the electric forces are both reckoned in the same direction, 7.¢., along the
outward drawn normal.
