If the numbers for simple and complex discharges be added together the following

are classified according to distance. The greater number of discharges which is here

Tables XIII and XIV, representing the most distant discharges, shows a preponderance

Before discussing in detail the results given in Tables XI-XIV, it is of interest to
compare them with the results of some earlier unpublished observations which were
