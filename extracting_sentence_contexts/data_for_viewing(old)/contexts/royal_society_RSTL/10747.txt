+ It is remarkable that the value of the © rotational coefficient” of nickel should also exceed that of
the other magnetic metals.



AND STRAIN ON THE ACTION OF PHYSICAL FORCES. 167

longitudinal mechanical stress, which must canse rotation of the molecules to a certain
extent, but without magnetic polarity, actually, unless carried to a very great excess,
produces decrease of resistance, we are probably right in conjecturing that the change
of resistance resulting from magnetization is in a great measure due to the fact that
the current used in the © bridge” is encountered by a seb of molecular currents
circulating all more or less in the same direction, and in planes mor or less at right
angles to the direction of the former current as the induced magnetism is greater
or less.

RELATION BETWEEN THE © ROTATIONAL COEFFICIENT” Of METALS AND THE
ALTERATION OF RESISTANCE PRODUCED BY MECHANICAL STREss.

E. H. Har has discovered that when a strip of metal along which a current is
passing is placed between the poles of an electromagnet in such a position that the
lines of magnetic force are perpendicular to the plane of the strip, an electromotive
force is developed in a direction at right angles both to the plane of the strip and the
