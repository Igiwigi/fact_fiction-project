In the horizontal component of the vector field, we have incorporated the effect of an underlying
current of strength «. For « <0, we have a current in the opposite wave-propagation direction,
while for « >0 it is in a favourable direction. We should point out that the average of the
horizontal fluid velocity at any depth (beneath the trough) equals «, a fact that explains the
interpretation of « as a measure of the strength of the underlying uniform current [21].

(a) Green's third identity

Now, we take advantage of the potential theory framework in order to evaluate, in a very
efficient and accurate fashion, the vector field for the trajectory equations (2.8); namely only using
boundary values of the potential. This follows from Green’s third identity. Take a periodic cell in our fluid domain, which will be denoted by Q.
