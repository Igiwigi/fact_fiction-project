obtained: when the knife edges are viewed as dark objects/on
a light ground ; and on the contrary, the same quantity to
be added. when they are seen as light objects on a dark
ground.

From the few experiments I have made, this quantity ap-
pears to be the same, whatever may be the relative illumina-
tion of the object and its ground, 0 long as the difference of
character is preserved. On the cause of this extraordinary
fact I can hazard no conjecture, and it remains an interesting
subject for future investigation.

Of the expansion of the pendulum.

The composition of brass is so various, that probably no
two specimens possess precisely the same rate of expansion.
It became therefore necessary to determine the expansion of
the pendulum by direct experiment, instead of adopting the
conclusions of others, and for this. purpose the following
method was used. A trough of deal was made of a length
sufficient to receive the bar intended for the pendulum, which
was placed edgewise in the middle of the trough, being
