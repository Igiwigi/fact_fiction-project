By the use of this double unipolar arrangement we are able to produce
© Pphosphorescence in tubes of much lower exhanst than with an effective current, but
© both of these methods are inferior in this respect to the method described in Section
© XVIL, which is a combination of a unipolar with an inductive discharge. Another very convenient arrangement for showing the phenomenon of relief-phos-
© phoresence consists in the use of a tube in which the terminals are near together at
i one end. The introduction of an air-spark will fill the remaining portion of the tube
' with a luminous discharge or haze (according to the degree of exhanstion), which is in
»| fact a unipolar discharge (Plate 27, fig. 12). If the air-spark be in the positive circuit,
