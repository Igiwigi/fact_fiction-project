photograph before it can be analysed. The quality of the definition obtained makes
it probable that the relative values of the wave-lengths recorded in Tables I, Il and
III may be relied on to about 0-002 A.U., and those of Table IV to about 0-005 AU.
The absolute values were obtained from measurements of a number of plates, and are
probably correct to 0-01 A.U., excepting for the heads of the red group, for which the
error may average 0-02 A.U. Tables V and VI give the wave-lengths of the heads of the
violet and the red groups.

The only other fine structure measurements of Swan bands are those by Komp (7)
of the 5635 head, Hiypricus (8) of the 4737 head, and Lertnen (9) of the 5165 head,
the data of which were presumably obtained from are photographs. As already
mentioned, the fine structure of the bands is in this case strikingly different in appearance
from that of vacuum tube production—the former produces, in fact, a high temperature
and the latter a characteristically low temperature distribution of energy among the
rotational states. The difference in appearance, together with other peculiarities,
originally suggested to the writer that two distinct systems were involved in each band,
each consisting of a P and an R branch. These were called the “ Tail” system and the
“Head” system, and were investigated extensively as such (vide Section V). There are
no Q branches present. Under are conditions the fine structure of both systems is
remarkably developed—e.g., in the 5165 head (see Plate 4 Nos. 4 and 5) the “ Head”
triplets, which almost fade out at 10 or 12 A.U. from the head, are developed in the are
to at least 120 A.U. Long exposures would probably make it possible to double this
extension. On the other hand, the “Tail” triplets—which are a very conspicuous
feature in the tube photographs, being developed from about the point where the “Head”
system fades away—are comparatively faint in the are until we proceed much further
