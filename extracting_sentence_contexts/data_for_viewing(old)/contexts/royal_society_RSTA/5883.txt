leaving an isotropic universe: ‘- - - the emphasis was on the refocusing of cosmological theory from
measuring the FRWL constants to explaining why we live in an FRWL universe. - -’ [124]. For


simple Bianchi types this is indeed true, but later it was shown that such smoothing processes
were probably not efficient enough [125].

In fact, the problem of explaining why the universe is homogeneous on the largest scales must
be decided long before the universe became Friedmann-like, due to a geometrical property of
the non-intersection of the past light cones called the horizon problem. The existence of particle
horizons would prevent the further synchronization of conditions in such a universe because
domains in the microwave sky separated by more than a few degrees are causally disconnected,
and, in fact, were so since the time of emission (last scattering surface). The Mixmaster universe,
although describing a period before the Friedmannian stage of evolution of the universe, cannot
solve the horizon problem and allow causal communication between such regions. This follows
from detailed calculations of D. M. Chitre (cf. [126], chap. V), resulting in the probability for the
vanishing of a horizon in the model to be 0.02%.

However, the Mixmaster universe in the Misner or the BKL formulations is clearly a chaotic
system as it is demonstrated by a combination of numerical and analytic evidence [127-132] and
references therein. This property is what makes the investigation of the generic inhomogeneous
Mixmaster universe so difficult. Nowadays, the Mixmaster universe is studied using qualitative
methods and the theory of attractors [133-135].

Therefore, the original hopes for explanation of the large-scale homogeneity through the
