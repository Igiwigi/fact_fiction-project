The shapes of these aérobian cells (or “ involution forms ”’) are shown in outline in
Plate 11, figs. 8 and 9, and will be seen to be usually pyriform, or some modification of
that figure. If we take into consideration all the facts I have been able to elucidate about this
yeast, and compare them with what is known of other species of Saccharomyces, it
will be evident that my species is one allied to S. ellipsoideus* (as amended by
Hansen), though not identical with it. Dr. Morris writes of this form: ‘“ It was at,
first thought that it was the same as one isolated from the air by us, but the nature
of the film-formation is opposed to that conclusion” . . . “It does not agree
with any previously described.”
