within the general synclinal structure. It is bounded on the west by a north-south
fault which has given rise to the steep-sided gully which debouches onto the northern
flats.

Though Kaitherin and Lorienatom must in the first place have originated as vol-
canic piles, they appear to have been greatly modified by earth movement. This is
borne out by a section seen in a gorge on Lorienatom to the north of the Kalamakat
ridge. In that section the relationship of the various lavas and dykes was not very
clear; nevertheless, it could be seen that the rocks had been greatly crushed with the
resultant deformation of the associated yellow tufts, and to a lesser extent of the lavas.
In its upper part (at about 3000 ft.) the gorge has cut through a west-dipping series of
massive red rhyolites which show comparatively little sign of fracture or folding. It
may be that this is due to the fact that they lie at too great an altitude above the main
zone of disturbance.

South-west of Lorienatom at the Nakinomet road turn-off, a low scarp stands up
from the plains. It faces east and the dip slope is inclined to the west at 20°. This scarp
is clearly a fault and can be traced in a wide curve to the north-east, where it appar-
ently runs into the Lorienatom massif south of the Virgin’s Breast. At its southern end
it loses altitude and finally dies out under the alluvium south of the Sudan-Kenya
boundary.
