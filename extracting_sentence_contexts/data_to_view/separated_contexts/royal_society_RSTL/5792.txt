Indeed my knowledge of the anatomy of the Ascidie is too
limited to permit me to do 80 satisfactorily. I can therefore only hope that Mr. HuxLey
= will shortly publish his researches bearing upon this matter, for assuredly no one is
Shbetter prepared than he is to discuss it, as no one has a more extended knowledge of
2the morphology of the Mollusca, and a more complete and accurate acquaintance with the
=anatomy of the Ascidic. = Taking it for granted, then, that the atrium and the perivisceral chamber are homo-
Slogous, the question arises, what light does this fact throw upon the function of the
Slatter? In the Ascidie, the atrium communicating freely with the swrrounding element
Zmight be considered as a sort, of rudimentary water-system, by those who believe in the
Zexistence of 8uch a system. Its function, however, seems to be that of excretion.
