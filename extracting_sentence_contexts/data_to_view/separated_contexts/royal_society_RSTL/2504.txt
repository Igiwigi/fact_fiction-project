In the storms of the
21st and 22nd of April 1830 at Poona, the hail-stones were larger than marbles ; and
they were of a similar size in a hail-storm in the fort of Hurreechundurghur, at
3943 feet above the ea, in the preceding April. I have known a mass of clear ice
fall exceeding an inch in diameter, and I have been assured that much larger pieces
have been picked up. On one occasion at Poona the hail-stones consisted of globular
masses of clear ice, in which was imbedded a star of many points, of diaphanous ice
like ground glass; and I deemed the fact sufficiently curious to induce me to make
drawings of some of the stones. AND METEOROLOGY OF DUKHUN. 191

Dews first appear towards the close of the monsoon, on the last mornings of Sep-
tember after cloudless nights. A precipitation of moisture takes place on similar
nights in October and November.
