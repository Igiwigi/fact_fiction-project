While these theoretical constraints should not be mistaken for strong evidence or proof that
the Higgs boson should indeed be found within a certain mass range, they nevertheless give
useful guidance to the experiments. In particular, if no assumptions are made for the validity of
the SM beyond the experimentally achievable energy scales, namely of order 1 TeV or several
hundreds of GeV, then the considerations above lead to a possible Higgs mass range from
almost vanishing mass up to approximately 1TeV. In fact, in the following, I will describe
how this mass range has been probed by different experiments. Direct searches at LEP have
covered (and excluded) Higgs masses from about 0 up to 114GeV, the direct searches at the
Tevatron were mostly sensitive to a Higgs boson with mass between approximately 100 and
180 GeV, while indirect constraints from precision data indicated that the Higgs boson should
be rather light (approx. 100 GeV or so), while higher masses, in particular above 160-170 GeV,
were disfavoured. It is worth noting that much more detailed reviews and discussions of the historical
developments can be found in [13-20].

‘Note that this is about a million times higher in energy, or smaller in distance, than that which can be probed at the most
powerful accelerator (microscope) in the world, the LHC.
