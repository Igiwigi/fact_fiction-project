It is impossible that this
structure can take any part in the production of colour, as is the case with the two
following examples, because S. nobilis and similar bugs are peculiar for the rapidity
with which all colour disappears at the first attempt to polish them. The cuticle is
liable to frill with great ease, as is shown in the figure. In fact, it seemed so possible
that, in spite of its thinness, this film might be divided into layers of air and chitin,
that renewed attempts were made to alter the colour by pressure and by placing
in vacuo, but without success. â€˜Thus it appears that chitin may frill in this way,
though the layers were previously in optical contact. If the colour is due to selective
metallic reflection, it is destroyed so easily by polishing that it seems possible the
colour-producing layer is on the surface instead of under a protecting cuticle.
