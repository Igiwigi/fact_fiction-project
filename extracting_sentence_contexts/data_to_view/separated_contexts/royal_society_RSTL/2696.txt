The
most depressing passion in a comparatively small degree will excite, the most ex-
citing in an excessive degree directly debilitate ; and the same stimulus by which
either the nervous or muscular fibre is directly excited, will by its excessive application
directly deprive it of power. I know of no exception to this law. All medicines
within their stimulant range excite, and unless the excitement exceeds the degree
which produces no correspondent depression, (for such a degree of excitement is com-
patible with the laws of the vital though not with those of the sensitive system*,) it
acts as a permanent tonic, All, beyond their stimulant range, act as directly, and
although within that range, if of a certain intensity, as indirectly debilitating powers
with respect to both systemsÞ.

IT is evident from many facts, stated in my papers on the Nature of Sleep and
Death, that each of the foregoing systems is a whole, which cannot be influenced in
any one part without a tendeney to be affected in all others; a property which perhaps
more than any other influences the progress of their deviations from the healthy state;
for every part more or less feeling the change effected in any one, if there be any from
accidental causes more liable to disease than the rest, this part particularly feels the
cause which operates on all; and, as I shall soon have occasion to point out more
particularly, is even the means of diyerting its effects from every other part. 'Thus
it is that diseases of continuance become complicated, and that an affection, attended
with little risk in the part firs: impressed by the offending cause, often becomes
formidable by its secondary effects. *
