thorax*®, than to the hamapophyses in their totality.

4th. The parial or lateral parts of the plastron, more especially the hyosternals and
hyposternals, are the true © hzmapophyses'; but in connation with dermal bony plates
to which their characteristic breadth, especially in the land and freshwater Chelo-
nians, is chiefly due. The entosternal, and perhaps the episternals, which repeat the
transverse bar of the T-shaped sternum in Lacertia and Monotremata, are the 8ole
parts of the plastron which can be referred to the *sternum ' in special homology and
to the © hzemal spine ” of the typical vertebra in general homology.

SUPPLEMENT.

The justly-merited reputation of Prof. Ravakrs as an embryologist, and the fact
of his having deduced his views of the mixed nature of the thoracic-abdominal part
of the skeleton of the Chelonian Reptiles from obseryation of its development, equally
demand that his conclusions should not be abandoned without special grounds being
assigned, RaTakE concludes, as has been before stated, that the carapace belongs to
the endo-skeleton exclusively-f, and the plastron as exclusively to the exo-skeleton$.

With regard to the carapace, he says, © The spinous processes are already deve-
loped from the second to the eighth dorsal vertebra before the exclnsion of the em-
DIFOs cioicats they remain pretty short, but contrary to the general laws of development
of the vertebrate animals, they grow 80 much in breadth, that they form, after their
ossification, a series of horizontal plates of moderate size\,” He also takes occasion
to confute the assertions of Carus, WaGngk and PeTERs, that these plates are first
