to the resonance of the voice in a room: the length of the pipe
in one case determining the sound, in the other, increasing its
strength. The frequency of the vibrations does not at all imme-
diately depend on the diameter of the pipe. It must be con-
fessed, that much remains to be done in explaining the precise
manner in which the vibration of the air in an organ pipe is |
generated. M, DaxieL BerNovili has solved several difficult /

problems relating to the subject ; yet some of his assumptions
are not only gratuitous, but contrary to matter of fact.

VI. Of the Divergence of Sound.

It has been generally asserted, chiefly on the authority of
Newron, that if any sound be admitted through an aperture
into a chamber, it will diverge from that aperture equally in all
directions. The chief arguments in favour of this opinion are
deduced from considering the phaznomena of the pressure of
fluids, and the motion of waves excited in a pool of water. But
the inference seems to be too hastily drawn : there is a very
material difference between impulse and pressure; and, in the
case of waves of water, the moving force at each point is the
