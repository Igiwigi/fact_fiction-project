Then singlet-Higgs mixing gives rise to the diagram of figure 6c. Current
bounds from direct searches limit the mixing angle at the level 6; < 0.04. In fact, some small
amount of mixing is required for successful baryogenesis in this model, since if s > â€”s is an exact
symmetry of the scalar potential, then the early universe will be equally populated by domains
with s >0 and s <0 during the EWPT, containing equal and opposite values of the BAU that
will eventually average to zero. Only very small (Planck-suppressed) mixing is needed to avoid
this problem: lifting the degeneracy between the s <0 and s>0 false vacua before the EWPT
will eliminate the higher energy phase as long as the domain walls separating the two phases
annihilate faster than the Hubble rate. Hence, we do not expect that relaxing this simplifying
approximation will change our quantitative estimates of the BAU.
