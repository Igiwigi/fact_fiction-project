Greenland and the Labrador coast. A major question in the years ahead concerns the degree to
which ice/glacial melt will impact overturning in the subpolar North Atlantic. Though a recent
study concluded that Greenland meltwater has not yet had an impact on overturning [75], at
some point this freshening is likely to completely counter wintertime cooling such that dense
water production in this basin is curtailed.

The OSNAP MHT is largely controlled by overturning dynamics. As such, the mean and

variability of MHT is dominated by OSNAP East. This is not the case for MFT, where OSNAP : Pa
West plays an outsized role for its size in terms of setting the mean and variability. The fresh : =
waters along the western boundary of the Labrador basin strongly impact the total OSNAP MFT. 8
As such, we have worked to improve our measure of the flow field and properties along the aieel
Labrador slope/shelf, particularly in light of the fact that we expect these waters to rapidly change :3
their properties as ice melt accelerates. : S

The OSNAP float program has revealed remarkably different spreading patterns for DSOW [3

and ISOW in the subpolar North Atlantic. ISOW spreads southward along multiple pathways,
including those to the east of the mid-Atlantic Ridge, while DSOW spreads primarily along
pathways that lead into the Labrador basin and then southward to the subtropics along pathways
to the west of the mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Lagrangian view of these overflow waters aids our
interpretation of the time scale for overturning anomalies to move downstream.

A redesign of the OSNAP observing system in order to reduce its complexity and cost has been
hampered by the realization of the complexity of the overturing dynamics. We now understand
