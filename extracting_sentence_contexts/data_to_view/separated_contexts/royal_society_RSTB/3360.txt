In the absence of details which would throw light upon the results of the special
breeding seasons for 1900-3 and enable a comparison to be made of the relative
numbers of coloured people in towns and in the country during those years, it is not
possible to express a definite opinion of the causes which operated to bring about this
variation. It is quite certain that during, and for some time after, the war, there was
great hardship and want experienced in the country districts, and that these factors
affected the coloured people, who chiefly inhabited the country at that time, more than
the whites, who were then largely confined to the towns. This fact, which I have already shown is a potent agent in favour of the production
of M., taken in conjunction with the racial characteristics of these people pointed out
above, namely, that circumstances which tend to act in favour of the production of M.
will act with exceptional force on them, may be sufficient to account for the variation ;
I am inclined to think it is so, but in default of adequate details am obliged to leave
the matter there. List or TABLEs. In the Text.
