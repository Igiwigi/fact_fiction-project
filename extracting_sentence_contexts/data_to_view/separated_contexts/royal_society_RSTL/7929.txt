Furthermore, Lepidosiren is the only fish whose teeth are comparable in form and
arrangement to those of Dipterus. Though Lepidosiren may not be included among the Crossopterygidae, uor
even in the order of Ganoidei, the relations just pointed out are not the les distinet ; and perhaps they gain in
interest when we reflect that while Polypterus, the modern representative of the rhombiferous Cros8opterygidea,
is that figh which has the most completely lung-like of all air-bladders, Zepidosiren, which has just been shown
to be, if not the modern reprosentatiye of the eycliferous Orossopterygida, yet their * next of kin,” is the only
fish which is provided with true lungs. These are unquestionable facts. I leave their bearing upon the great
problems of zoological theory to be developed by every one for himself.”
