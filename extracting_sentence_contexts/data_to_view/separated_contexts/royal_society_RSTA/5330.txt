Astronomy is a field of science that depends on ‘physico-mathematical
experimental learning’. It is a field that critically requires the construction of
yioneering experimental equipment. In fact, since the establishment of the Royal
Society, the equipment demands of astronomers have continually tested man’s
engineering capabilities. Undoubtedly, astronomy is one of the major forces to
oush the frontiers of precision engineering, today, engineering nanotechnology
applied to meso-sized and large ultra-precision optical components. The
application of metrology, today micro- and nano-metrology, to manufacturing
orocesses is a key element of ultra-precision engineering.
