With copper, the effect was
somewhat less. With zinc, the effect, was considerable : but with antimony
and bismuth scarcely any effect could be observed. But what is most remark-
able is the fact, that in all the cases the cold metal is positive and the hot
negative; or in other words, the cold metal has the same relation to the hot,
that zinc has to copper in an ordinary voltaic arrangement. This experiment
demonstrates that the free electricity developed by heat has no connexion
with that developed by voltaic action : since the effects of heat in developing
free electricity in platina is much greater than in iron ; whereas the yoltaic
electricity developed in iron is much greater than that developed in platina,
and both of an opposite character. Since this portion of free electricity deve-
loped by heat does not become voltaic, it is exceedingly improbable that the
electricity developed by the contact or pressure of metals should by immersion
in a liquid acquire this character.
