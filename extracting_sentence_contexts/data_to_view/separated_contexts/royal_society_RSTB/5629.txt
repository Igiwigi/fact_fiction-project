In a determination of the molecular weight by Rast’s method, 0-00354 gm. citrinin
caused a depression of 9-89° C. in the melting point of 0-03994 gm.- camphor. This
corresponds to a molecular weight of 356. It was noted, however, that distinct signs
of some decomposition or interaction between the citrinin and camphor were visible
during the experiment, a fact which would render the above estimation invalid. Optical activity of citrinin. Citrinin is levorotatory in alcoholic solution. 0-4996 gm. of citrinin was dissolved
in 100 c.c. of absolute alcohol and polarised in the mercury green light in a 20 cm. tube.
