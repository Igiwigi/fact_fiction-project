*the time of day‚Äù for abscissa.

The fifth step was drawing a curve line passing through or near eyery point in
every month at all the hours, giving equal weight to every point. In nearly every
case a simple curved line passed through all the points.

The sixth and last step was the measuring the ordinates at every Greenwich hour,
and in this way the tables were formed.

The accordance in the results at the same hour in the same month in the different
years being found s0 close and satisfactory, together with the fact of a simple curve
passing through all the points, the diurnal march, as shown in the Tables, may be
considered as a very close approximation to the facts of nature.

There is a promise at present of systematic observations being taken at many
places in England, and by gentlemen of assured competency ; these tables will assist
such persons very much in determining at what times observations should be taken
to determine different atmospherical elements.

As a remark applying to all the Tables in this paper, I may here mention that ob-
servers will find that comparatively a very few observations in each day, at hours by
no means inconvenient in ordinary life, will furnish a near approximation to the
mean and extreme valnes, as well as to the diurnal and annual variations of atmo-
Spherical phenomena,
