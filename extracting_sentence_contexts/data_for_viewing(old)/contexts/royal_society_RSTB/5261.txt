It is unprofitable to attempt an exact estimate of size on data of the kind available,
but one may say without fear of exaggeration that Clepsydropsis australis was a tree
fern exceeding in size of trunk and probably approaching in height some of the largest
tree-ferns of the present day. ‘The trunk, so far as we know, was unbranched, and
no doubt stood upright, perhaps recalling that of a large columnar cycad more than
any tree-fern known.

An intriguing problem is the presence of such large numbers of apparently active

and healthy roots inside the older petioles. Viewing the facts as they are, and they
have been sufficiently discussed above, we may conclude that these invading roots
entered only the stumps of fallen or decayed leaves, and that they grew downwards
till their progress was arrested by the living cells of the leaf-base. ‘The xylem strands
of the leaf-stumps might still have conducted a feeble stream of water, while possibly
the humified remains of the softer tissues may have provided the roots with assimilable
food materials. Thus it is not inconceivable that this Paleozoic tree-fern actually
reared itself, in part at least, ‘‘ upon its own ashes.”

The likelihood that there was a root-felt over the false stem has already been
mentioned. The predominantly downward course of the roots enhances the probability
that the root-felt was thicker round the lower parts of the false stem; here, indeed,
such a thick supporting structure would be more in demand than higher up. Con-
