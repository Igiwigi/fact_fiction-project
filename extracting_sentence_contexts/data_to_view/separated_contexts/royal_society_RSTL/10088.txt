In the firsb place, it
may be stated, as a general rule, that the thicker the pit membrane the easier can
the threads be distinguished. In very thin pib membranes the observation of 8uch
threads as may cross it requires great precaution and care; there is nothing, 80 to
peak, for the eye to catch upon, and one has to detect a line within a line. Tt is
this very fact that causes endosperm tissue to be 80 favourable for 8uch an investi-
gation as the present one ; for here, nob only, as a rule, are both the cells and the
pits unusually large, but, what is much more important, the pit membranes are
thick. In many cases, however, this is not the case, and an examination of sueh-
examples as Manicaria, Mauritia, or Caryota is quite sufficient to prove that the

8necessful observation of the threads erossing a thin pit membrane is a matter of
extreme difficulty ; and it also serves to show that in other cases where the pits are
very small and the membranes very thin this difficulty is s0 increased as to become
almost an impossibility.
