The discrete methods are less accurate compared to the pseudo-spectral scheme. Still, given
sufficiently large lattice, discrete methods capture the essential non-equilibrium features of
turbulence. This is due to fact that the presence of large-scale structures and small-scale
dissipation naturally generates the energy cascade, and hence Kolmogorovâ€™s k~*/> spectrum. Thus, inaccurate methods too capture this robust feature. Note, however, that discrete methods
require larger grids than the spectral method due to the lower accuracy of discrete methods.
