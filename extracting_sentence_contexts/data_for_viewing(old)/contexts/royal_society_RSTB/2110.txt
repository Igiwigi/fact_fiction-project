is therefore difficult. Lerrams* discusses the question, quoting N. J. MiiEr’s views as
to heat causing the stomata to open, and SCHWENDENER’S opposed opinion ; Lerrern
also gives his own experiments. With the perianth of Galtonia he got clear opening
of the stomata at a temperature of 33°, but with the leaves of Galtoniat he agrees
with ScHWENDENER’S results in certain leaves, 7.e., that dark heat does not open the
stomata. LerrcEeB explains the different behaviour of the perianth and the leaf, by
the differences in the coercion exercised by the surrounding epidermis in the two
cases. More recently Kouxt has shown by the microscopic method that heat from
a blackened metal-plate, or a current of warm vapour rapidly open the stomata of
Trianea; he also used light which had passed through a solution of iodine in carbon
bisulphide. Exerr got similar results.§

This last fact I have confirmed. By means of a heliostat the sun’s rays were
passed through the bisulphide and kept the stomata of Campanula pyramidalis open
for two hours (March 30, temperature 17°). On March 29 the same species was
kept open for three hours at 15°, and the stomata shut on being darkened. Another
day a Tropaolum leaf was kept open at 13° for two hours, and shut in one hour
by darkness.

And speaking from general experience, I cannot doubt that a high temperature
has at least some effect in keeping the stomata open. Indeed, this was one of my
difficulties when using sunshine and colour-screens.

The following may be worth quoting as showing a direct effect :
