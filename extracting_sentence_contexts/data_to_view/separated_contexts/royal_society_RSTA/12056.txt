With a large excess of oxygen the secondary reaction, whereby carbonic
acid is formed, influences the result, for the conditions are eminently favourable for
the interaction of the carbonic oxide, steam, and oxygen. TABLE XVITI.—The Rate of Explosion of Acetylene (1) with Oxygen, and (2) with
Oxygen and Nitrogen.*

These experiments show that in all the cases examined, viz., the combustion of
cyanogen, marsh gas, ethylene, and acetylene, the substitution of nitrogen for the
oxygen required to burn the carbon from carbonic oxide to carbonic acid increases the
velocity of the explosion. These facts seem only consistent with the view that the
carbon burns directly to carbonic oxide, and the formation of carbonic acid is an
after-occurrence.
