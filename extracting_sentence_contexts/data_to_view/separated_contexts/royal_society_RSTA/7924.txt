Basic.—Arginine 59, lysine 19, histidine 4 (= 82*),

Acidic.—Glutamie acid 88, aspartic acid 17 (= 105 = 82 + 234). Hydroxy.—Serine 28, proline 38, tyrosine 27 (= 93). Inactive—Amide-acids} 23, tryptophane 9, glycine 8, alanine 50, valine 24, leucine 88 (= 202).
(Cystine) /2.—109.

* These would react with 82 cc. of N.HCl; actually, Speakman and Hirst loc. cit. find 80 cc.

} Following Spmaxman and Hirst, 82 are allotted as chemically equivalent to the 82 bases above,
leaving 23 for combination with amide-nitrogen, though, as a matter of fact, even more are required to
account for all the amide-nitrogen found. We can thus derive the following series of ratios, in successive degrees of approxima-
tion ;—

Basic. Acidic.
