To apply the conceptions of THoma and others to the problem of intra-embryonic
vascular development, we must picture an underlying morphological plan which
gradually unfolds as development proceeds, and in conformity with which the
vascular system condenses out of a series of capillary plexuses. Unless we can shed
some light on the nature of this pre-existing plan, each stage in the development
of which presumably conditions the next, and which involves the whole general
problem of the nature of the causes underlying development, we are not likely to
advance far along this path. One fact we may, however, notice at the outset. The capillary system of even an early embryo is by no means a uniform one, and
is itself conforming to a morphological plan. It is this fact which renders the
“ Netztheorie ” in a rigid form untenable.
