The tRNA&éc variant we characterized has an with our MS/MS data showing greater Ala mis-incorporation *
A34, which is normally converted to inosine (134) [41]. The from tRNAGXc A3G compared to tRNAA.

134 base is capable of superwobble and can read codons
ending in U, C or A [10]. The fact that we showed this tRNA

reads multiple GGC codons with Ala, suggests that the 134 (c) Cell viability and protein homeostasis despite low

modification is intact. The mCherry construct contains only fidelity translation
one other Gly codon (GGU), and we found evidence that We are only at the beginning of our understanding of human
both tRNA“ and the tRNA°’ variants direct Ala mis-incor- tRNA variants and their ability to cause mistranslation or
poration at Gly56 (GGU) (electronic supplementary material, impact health and disease [17]. Mutations that cause tRNAs
