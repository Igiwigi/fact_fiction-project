In 1822 Sir EpwAaRD SABINE made an observation on the temperature of the Carib-
bean Sea at a depth of 6000 feet (the actual length of rope was 7380 feet, but of this
1380 feet were allowed for slack and drift), and a reading of 45%5 F. was obtainedF.
On another occasion on this voyage, Sir EDWARD used a solid iron case to. protect the
thermometer against pressure, but it did not prove sufficiently close to exclude water.

In 1823-26 KoTzEBUE commanded another voyage of circumnavigation {, and on this
occasion he was accompanied by Emir. vox LExz, who s8ubsequently published several
important memoirs on the deep-sea temperatures and on the specific gravity of sea-
water taken on this occasionh. His observations are remarkable from their being
made at, greater depths and their recording lower temperatures than any others made
up to that time, or, in fact, until long subsequently, in tropical seas. One observation,
in the Pacific, 21*:14 north latitude, indicated at a depth of 5835 feet, by his corrected
reading, a temperature of 36*4 F., and another, 6476 feet deep, in the Atlantic, 32%20
north latitude, gave 35*8 F.

Although only fifteen observations were made, they were mostly at considerable depths,
and they were all taken with various precautions and subjected to careful corrections ||.

On his first voyage KorzeBue experienced s0 much trouble with the self-registering
thermometer, owing to the mercury passing over the index and to the shifting of the
index from jolts or shaking, that on this second yoyage Lenz reverted to Harrs's
mode of taking deep-sea temperatures, using an improved apparatus arranged by PARRoT,
the Russian Academician . The apparatus, which he termed a bathometer, was 16 inches
