Such slight change as occurred is no more than is observed from time to time in an
experiment in which the curves are repeatedly taken without further experimental
interference. The uniformity of distribution to a given ventricle, when the contra-
lateral bundle division is not conducting, before and after the production of auriculo-
ventricular dissociation, is readily to be explained upon the usual assumption that in
A-V dissociation the impulses spring from the bundle itself immediately below the
seat of damage. Asa matter of fact, full justification of the primary experiment
lies in its end result: the algebraic relation between dextrogram, levogram and
bigram. Such accurate fitting cannot be coincidental and can be explained only by
the hypothesis suggested. SEPARATE CONSIDERATION OF THE LEVOGRAM AND DEXTROGRAM.
