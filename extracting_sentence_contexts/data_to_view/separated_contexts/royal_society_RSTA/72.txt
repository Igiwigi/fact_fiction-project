The observations are numbered to
‘Sorrespond with Plate i3. = No permanent change of resistance of the platinum wire was with certainty
Bletected in this series of experiments, in spite of the prolonged heating to which the

piral was subjected, and although it was in contact with the glass of the bulb for a
@onsiderable portion of its length. The apparent change of temperature coefficient
Brom R,/R, = 1°3391, Series IV., to 1°3395, Series V., was probably due to the fact that

he position of the loose comparison-electrode was shifted so as accurately to correspond
‘Ewith the single electrode inside the capillary tube ; it had been accidentally misplaced
through an error in measurement in Series TV. The apparent change in the value of

Ry in Series A.—v. from 19°674 to 19°668 (the latter value exactly was observed again
one month latter, on April 18) was probably partly due toa change in the comparison-
electrode, the copper portion of which was accidentally fused in re-coating with hard
glass on March 4, so that it had to be re-made, and its resistance was slightly increased ;
and partly, perhaps, to a change in the plug contacts in the 10-ohm arm of the bridge,
which were thoughtlessly altered on that day to measure another resistance. The
value R, = 19°668 should, of course, be used in reducing the observations from
March 4 onwards.
