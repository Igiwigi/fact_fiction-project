me, that, on the principles of the antiphlogistic theory, it ought
to be a compound of potassium, a little oxygene and nitro-
gene, or a combination of a suboxide of potassium and nitro-
gene ; for the hydrogene disengaged in the operations of
which it was the result, nearly equalled the whole quantity
contained in the ammonia employed; and it was easy to ex-
plain the fact of the reproduction of the ammonia by water,
on the supposition, that by combination with one portion of
the oxygene of the water, the oxide of potassium became pot-
ash, and by combination with another portion and its hydro-
gene, the nitrogene was converted into volatile alkali.

With a view to ascertain this point, I made several expe-
riments on various residuums, procured in the way that I
have just stated, from the action of equal quantities of potas-
sium on dry ammonia in platina trays, each portion of metal
equalling six grains.

In the first trials, I endeavoured to ascertain the quantity of
