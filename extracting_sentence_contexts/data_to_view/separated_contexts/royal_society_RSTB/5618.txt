We cannot be sure that
the peaks represent anything more than selective breeding. The evidence as a whole
is consistent with the view that the most completely « and ¢ strains are the end terms
of a graded series ; on the other hand, established « and « strains are very distinct from
one another and the border-line groups (& between 1 and 10) occur mostly in places in
the pedigrees where it is not unreasonable to suppose that heterozygous K E groups
might be present. The main facts about the occurrence and behaviour of < strains will be best appre-
hended by a study of the pedigree tables, especially I and VI. The data have been
pretty thoroughly analysed in a variety of ways, of which it is impossible to give a
full discussion. The following summary covers the chief points :—

(a) Origin and progress of < strains —EK broods may occur anywhere in sinistral lines
or as the recessive component of heterozygous dextrals.
