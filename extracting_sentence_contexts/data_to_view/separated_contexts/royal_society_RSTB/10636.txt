The path towards saturation of synaptic weights during a pair-
ing experiment (figure 8) is vital to building better plasticity
models. Virtually any information which helps theorists to

constrain how the synaptic weight increases would be help-
ful. Importantly, this also includes any information about
conditions (or experimental protocols) which do not induce
plasticity, despite the fact that either the presynaptic or the
postsynaptic neuron or both have been activated.

11. Condusion

One of the most striking differences between plasticity models
and experimental data concerns their timescales. Hebbian plas-
ticity can be induced within seconds to minutes [45,68,69,87].
