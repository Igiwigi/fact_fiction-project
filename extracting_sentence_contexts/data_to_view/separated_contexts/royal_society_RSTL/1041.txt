On this principle no conclusions can be drawn re-
specting the human species, from observations either on vege-
tables, or even on frogs toads, and newts. Birds, as being im-
pregnated by semen conveyed into the body, resemble human
impregnation more than the former: but they differ 80 obvi-
ously in the mode of perfecting the foetus from the ovum,
that I scarcely dare to rest any thing on their general analogy. There is, however, a curious fact respecting them not altogether
inapposite to this question, which is, the permanent effect of
one coitus. I have read in the Abb6 SPraLLanzAnt's. disserta-
tion, and elsewhere, that all the eggs which a hen will lay in
twenty days will be impregnated at one coitus: and Mr. CLing

tells me, that in Norfolk this matter is reduced to a certainty
