lines, shown on the map, which are linked to 8, (2) by 3774°14+4+1007'23 and another
by 2458 +2416, clearly u+v, an enlarged e¢ link is quite a common starting one from
S and P series lines. Moreover the next link 959°49 is just as much displaced one way
from ¢ as 377414 is in the other from e, for 3774°144+959°49 = 4933°63 = 3771°00
+962°63. Thus the line 18744°28 is exactly e+d+e above S,(2). In fact we have
a case of “ series inequality.” The link—966°09 to the next is excessive, but it is
entered because (see list Nos. 3, 4, 5) the displacement (—38) in (3) is destroyed in (4)
by adding a é to it, thus making it normal, and then another 4 on the (4) and on the
—e link reproduces (5). So far all seems satisfactory but other considerations come
in, in connection with the line 18744. There is an analogous set of doublets of the D
type (see also p. 372) in each of Au, Ag and Cu with the proper doublet separation for
each element. That they belong to the D type with negative values in Au and Cu
is proved by their Zeeman effect, but the pattern for Ag has not been determined.
The Au set show a satellite while Cu does not, as is usual with the first element in
a group. In Ag the doublet set are D,, = —18026, D,, = —18947 with respective
intensities of 4 and 1. There is a line 18756 also of intensity 4 which naturally seems
to be —D,,, but its satellite difference is not sufficiently near a multiple of 6, to give
