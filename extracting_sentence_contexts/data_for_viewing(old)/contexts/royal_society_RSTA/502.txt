sufficient heat to account for the observed slower-than-adiabatic radial dependence of the a
temperature. Verma et al. further concluded that the estimated heating was more consistent [5
with the expectations of a Kolmogorov-like turbulent fluid cascade rather than a Kraichnan— .
Iroshnikov-like magnetofluid cascade [22,23]. However, the heating in the model was not quite
adequate to account fully for the observed temperature dependence and the authors concluded
that other processes, such as heat flux, might be involved.” To add to the complexity of this
problem, Tu [24] found no evidence for turbulent heating in the time period he studied.

In the latest effort to include turbulent heating in the context of a global model of the solar
wind [25], electrons, protons and interstellar pick-up protons were all given separate energy
equations and the electron heat flux was incorporated using the approximation first derived
by Hollweg [26,27]. While that model shows that turbulence does heat the solar wind, the
paucity of observations in the outer heliosphere, coupled with the fact that the Voyager plasma
instrument cannot see the pick-up proton temperature component, makes it difficult to draw
definitive conclusions. Furthermore, the trajectory of Voyager 1 takes it out of the ecliptic plane
and the model shows that high-latitude regions are hotter than is the ecliptic, which tends to
obscure the effects of heating by turbulence. Consequently, it is important to examine in detail
in situ measurements of the dissipation range of the turbulence to ascertain the detailed physical
processes that heat the wind.

One way to estimate heating of the solar wind is to measure the rate of the turbulent energy
