Another view, however, may be taken of the growth of such an
ndividual as fig. 52: thus, we may suppose that absorption has taken place, opening
Foraminal communications between the last and the former chambers. Either hypo-
Ahesis would explain the fact, â€”that, as we find on breaking open very large specimens
f the normal P. lactea, the stolon-passages between the older chambers are very free and
Satulous; whereas the terminal mouth of the last chamber presents the radiate condi-
Ron; the only passage here for the sarcode being the thin slits around the strong
Srowth of hyaline shelly matter in the mouth. b Fig. 45 represents the group of individuals to which D'ORBr6xy applied the snb-
Seneric term Gobuling; but neither this term nor that of Guttuling (another s0-called
Subgenus) can be separated from the ordinary, more or less oval, more or less pyriform,
r more or less elongate varieties of Polymorphina lactea.
