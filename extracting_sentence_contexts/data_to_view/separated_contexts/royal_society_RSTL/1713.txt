No. 1, 2, 3, 4, are spheres of platina, lead, brass and ivory ; all of the 8ame
diameter ; which is s0omewhat less than 14 inch. The platina sphere (No. 1.),
which has been kindly lent to me, for the occasion, by the Astronomer Royal,
is of French manufacture, and about 1-44 inch in diameter ; which is the
same size as that used by M. Bror in his pendulum experiments, and in fact
appears to have been formed from the same model *, It is furnished with a
copper calotte, and also with a knife edge, attached to a frame, capable of
being brought to a state of synchronism with the pendulum with which it is
used, by means of a screw, in the manner described by M. Borpa in the Base
du Syst&me Mc6trique, vol. iii. page 338. Its specific gravity I found to be
21-042 ; and it weighed 8963 grains.
