protecting bracts and foliage-leaves, and it is therefore reasonable to suppose that the
present structures were originally connected with the flowers. This being so, there
are two possible alternatives as to their mode of origin and growth. In the first
place, only a few of these bracts are found, and they are somewhat delicate in
structure, their bases are not seen, but must have been quite thin; we may then
suppose that in exceptional cases a few sterile bracts were produced in a loose fashion
on the peduncle just below the microsporophylls, their points of attachment being
very narrow and leaving no scar.

A second and more probable explanation is that they were of the nature of bud-
scales

and, in fact, their general form is identical with that of the bud-scales of the
Horse-Chestnut. They may have been produced more particularly round the bud
from which the flower grew, but of which we at present know little, since a flower has
not yet been found in connection with a main stem.

Leaves.â€”It has already been pointed out that the remains of the flowers which

have just been described are constantly found in association with leaves of the type
previously known as Teniopteris vittata Br. I do not think that I have any
speeimen of the female part of the flower which does not show some portions of a
