This section is from 17 to 19 mm behind
section 6. Here the nasals are seen as large, thick bones. From the fact that the
surface of the nasals is grooved somewhat like the surface of the horn core of an un-

gulate apparently by blood vessels one may infer that over the nasals there was in life
a thick, horny plate or plates. In the closely allied Lycosuchus the nasals are united, and
there was probably a considerable horny boss developed on the snout. The section
passes through the posterior ends of the septomaxillaries.
