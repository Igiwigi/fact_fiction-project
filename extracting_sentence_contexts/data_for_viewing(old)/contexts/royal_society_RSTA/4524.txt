which can be subjected to random disturbances as discussed earlier. Of course, the investigation
of all possible generalizations is far beyond the scope of this work. Therefore, we concentrate on
the results for the pure deterministic packing. In such case, it is not necessary to take averages

over discs distributions. Nevertheless, we have performed several independent integrations for : =
the same geometry, as the CFD results may be susceptible to uncontrolled rounding-off error : yy
propagations. 2

The geometrical set-up considered the channel width =4.0mm, while the total length aes
L=33mm is assigned to the four zones according to the following scheme: Z; :1mm,; Z2:4mm : _
(packing zone); Z3 : 8mm, Z4 : 20 mm. By properly re-scaling the linear dimensions, velocities and : xs
fluid features of the fluid used in this study, our results can also be applied to similar systems of DN
different sizes. The fact that the permeability of similar systems of different size does not differ : g
much has been pointed out as an advantage of numerical methods in other approaches to porous :3

media problems [20,21].

3. Methods

The equations of mass and momentum conservation are integrated with the help of ANSYS-
FLUENT CED package, under the assumption of incompressible and isothermal regime [22]. The
equation of conservation of mass, or the continuity equation, is written as
