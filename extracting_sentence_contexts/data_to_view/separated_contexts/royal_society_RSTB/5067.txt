The same happened in the case of the small snakes, in which,
of course, this film is naturally much thinner. Itis of considerable morphologicalimportance that the Boide still possess well-developed
lids, and corroborates the view taken here that the false cornea is not the result of the
fused upper and lower lids, but the modified nictitans. These snakes are probably the
most ancestral of all living snakes, a fact which is of interest in this connection. In
Python molurus the false cornea is surrounded by an irregular circle of six scales, the
three anterior of which are at least three times the size of the others (see drawing). Drawing of scaly covering and false cornea of the eye of an adult python. (From life.)

These six scales are part of the scaly covering of the true outer eyelids, which have here
combined to form a single concentric cover.
