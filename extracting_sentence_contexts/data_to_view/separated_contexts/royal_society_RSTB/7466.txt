It is, however, more convenient to describe in another section the pipes
of the north coast of Papua from East cape to the northern boundary, irrespective of the
fact that the stretch of coast from East cape to Collingwood bay is generally considered
as belonging to the Massim area. The influence of the Massim culture is slight in
Collingwood bay. The main interest of the Massim area from my immediate point of view is the fact
that when Europeans first visited the islands tobacco smoking appears to have been
unknown in all but a few districts, and in these its introduction was probably recent. With and after the arrival of Europeans trade tobacco was bartered all over the area
to the natives, many of whom soon became habitual smokers. As one main aim of this investigation is to trace the spread of the cultivation and
smoking of native tobacco, it is necessary to learn what Europeans have recorded on
the subject in this area.
