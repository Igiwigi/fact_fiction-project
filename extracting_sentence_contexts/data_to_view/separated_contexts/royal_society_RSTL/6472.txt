2. That of BivpeR and Scnmpr, FrERICHs, and LEHMANN—that the excretion of urea
results chiefly from excess of food, and represents © luxus consumption,” and has no
necessary relation to tissne action or tissne metamorphosis. This is based upon the fact
that with excess of food, and with certain kinds of food, as gelatine, there is an almost
immediate increase in the elimination of nitrogen ; and this is abundantly supported by
the experiments of Lawzs and GILBERT, and by those recorded in this paper. 3. That of Lupwic and FunurER—that urea is due neither to the immediate changes |.
from food nor to changes from tissue, but to the destruction of blood-cells.
