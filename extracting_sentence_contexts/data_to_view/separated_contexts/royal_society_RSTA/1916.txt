This happens, for example, for fluid particles
located on right of the domain when the inner cylinder starts moving. Note that the unwinding
is less pronounced for greater values of 61, because each cylinder can perturb all fluid particles
more before the other cylinder reverses its rotation. In fact, the global stretching factor of a line is
not affected much by such unmixing / unwinding phases, because the growth rate is controlled by
the parts of the line that wind efficiently on the figure-eight braid. Nevertheless, the temporary
decrease of the length indicates that the protocol is inefficient for stretching a fraction of fluid
particles.

7. Measuring the quality of mixing from stretching factors

The topological entropy of the different flows, that is the asymptotic exponential growth rate of 13
material lines that we have studied above (figure 10), may be considered as a measure of the ao
mixing efficiency of the flow: the longer the interfaces, the more efficient is molecular diffusion, 78
hence mixing.
