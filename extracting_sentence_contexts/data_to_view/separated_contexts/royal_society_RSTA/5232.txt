Clearly, if, on average, both phases are equally distributed, the system : Ss

will tend to lock to any of the driving phases (or to some set of two opposite phases, as explained
below) and, as a result, will display phase bistability. On a more formal basis, rocking can be explained in terms of a mechanical analogy, which
historically was the line of reasoning that led to the discovery of rocking and led to its name. A simple way to visualize a (single) nonlinear oscillator is to use a mechanical analogy, in which
the real and imaginary parts of the complex oscillation amplitude are interpreted as the two
Cartesian coordinates q = (q1,q2) of a fictitious massless particle affected by viscous damping
and under the action of a potential V having the form of a Mexican sombrero (see figure 1). The
maximum of V at the origin corresponds to the unstable off state (of null oscillation amplitude)
and its degenerate minimum (the ‘valley’) to the self-oscillating state of finite amplitude (figure 1). The degeneracy of the minimum signals the phase invariance of the free oscillations, as no
angle is preferred.
