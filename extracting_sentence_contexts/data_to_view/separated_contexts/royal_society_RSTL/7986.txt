J. CLELAND ON THE VARIATIONS OF THE HUMAN SKULL.

somewhat open suture was the point taken for measurement, in adult skulls the rough
line was chosen which seems to form the limit between the two bones. In fact the
writer supposed, in common with anatomists generally, that this line was the mark of
the obliterated suture, but afterwards, suspecting the accuracy of this view, made a
special examination and found that it was really the mark of attachment of the pharynx
to the sphenoid bone, and that the position of the spheno-occipital suture was slightly
further back, and disappeared without leaving any trace. Besides the positions of the points on the skull already mentioned, it was necessary
that another should be registered to indicate the extent of the anterior cranial fossa. For this purpose the outer edge of the foramen opticum was chosen, the needle being
rested on it as far up as possible.
