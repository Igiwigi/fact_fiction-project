Both the ignorable model (Model 4.2) and the non-ignorable model (Model 4.3) account : =
for the possibility of unobserved errors. They inherently assume that the study consisted of [3
all assigned items (regardless of whether there is a response). In other words, we consider :3
Etotal = an = Obs + EMis the total number of errors committed in a set of J= vy Jj items : Ss
assigned for comparison. Thus for these models, we have the following definition: 1s
areal
XQ
Etotal
PE Ignorable = PE,Non-ignorable = i =.

We use the posterior predictive distribution of Pf|Y,R to derive inference on the error rate.
Note, we can do this after fitting the appropriate model despite having not observed the latent
variables EMis, To do so, we use the fact that for the ignorable model the following holds:

EPS ~ Binom(R;, pizi)
and
EM's ~ Binom(J; — Ri, pi(1 — 7))-

Similarly, for the non-ignorable model:

EQS ~ Binom(R;, pizt2/)

and

EMSs ~ Binom(Jj — Rj, pi(1 — 72/)).
