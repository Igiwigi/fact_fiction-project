It would appear, however, that the
mean size of the non-cyclic effect on the Astronomer Royal’s quiet days for a year
cannot be inferred from the character of that year as disturbed or otherwise. For
example, 1894 was much more disturbed than the years immediately preceding or
following it; but the mean non-eyclie effect in H at both Kew and Falmouth is
distinctly less for 1894 than for 1893 or 1895. There were, in fact, only 4 months
out of the 12 in which the non-cyelic effect in 1894 exceeded that in 1895, and only
2 months in which it exceeded that in 1893. Again, during the four sun-spot
minimum years, 1899 to 1902, few months showed anything that would be classified
as a magnetic storm in years of sun-spot maximum, and yet the proportion of months
showing a decidedly positive non-eyclic effect is the same as for the disturbed
year 1894. Solar Diurnal Inequality.
