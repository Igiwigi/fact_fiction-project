plant. Of the three more important form-genera of Palaeozoic Equisetalean plants
which are based on the form of the leaf and leafy shoot, Asterophyllites, Annularia,
and Lobatannularia, Annularia is the most abundant. It reaches its maximum
abundance in the Upper Carboniferous where it is a familiar constituent of most
Coal-Measure floras.

A large number of species of Annularia have been founded on the outline form of
the leaves and shoots of specimens preserved in the form of compressions. The
shape of the leaves and their manner of arrangement on the shoot are practically
the only criteria which have been used in distinguishing one species from another.
As a result some of the species are exceedingly ill defined and the nomenclature
and synonymy of the species in the genus are very involved. A good deal of confusion
is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales as in the fossil Lycopodiales the leaves
on the different orders of branches on one and the same plant may show considerable
differences. The leaves on the main axis or large branches of Annularia spheno-
phylloides ZENKER are quite different in size and shape from those found on the
ultimate branches. The best account of the genus Annularia and the systematic
relations of its species is given by Joncmans (1911 and 1914, pp. 5, 235).

Of the internal structure of plants belonging to this genus practically nothing is
known. CARPENTIER (1924) has described some structurally preserved leaves from
the Permian of Autun or the Stephanien of Grand Croix (Loire) which he compares
with an Annularia of the stellata type. Hoxpen (1935, p. 239) is, however, of the
opinion that these leaves may not belong to Equisetalean plants in view of the
absence of lignified bars on the stomatal guard cells. Certain authors have
