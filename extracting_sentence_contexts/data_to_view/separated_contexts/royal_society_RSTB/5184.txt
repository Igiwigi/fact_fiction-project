other parts with the artery X of Auits and with the plexus on the radicles of the efferent
branchial vessels of Hyrrn, combined with the fact of the artery-like structure of the
vessels and their frequent blood contents, leaves very little doubt that morphologically
this system is, or at any rate originally was, part of the arterial system. Injections in the Cod, Lophius and Pagrus show that in these fishes it is not now an,
integral part of it. The connection with it, where such has been described, is evidently
extremely slight and probably inconstant, otherwise it is difficult to account for the fact
that in the numerous careful injections of the blood vascular system of Teleosts that
have been made by Hyrti, Mttier, Voar, Auten, Atxis, Coxn, and other anatomists
the system as a whole has been, overlooked.
