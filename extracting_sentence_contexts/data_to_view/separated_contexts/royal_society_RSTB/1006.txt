The demand of the tissues under these conditions is too great for the 1
supply it immediately, even with active dilatation, and hence cedema oceurs, at)
possibility of its meeting that demand is still less if the active congestion, wl
the utmost that can be done by the vascular system, be hampered by the pr
of an increase of venous pressure. Here, not only is the rapidity of the blood
which is so essential a part of active congestion, impeded, but also the am
waste-products that can be removed in the blood is diminished, and hence the de:
of the tissues, instead of lessening, as it should do, becomes more and more
tive, with the result that the amount that leaves the blood-vessels is in
an indefinite period, and consequently the amount of cedema increases. That a functionally active part does not normally become cedematous
ordinary sense of the term, though its tendency is in that direction, is no dou
to the fact that the products of tissue change are carried away as soon 8
and that the accompanying active congestion is fully able to meet the deman'
only when they become stored up in greater quantities than normal that the
a source of danger to the part, and that the call of the tissues for their rem¢
urgent that the fluid poured out by the blood-vessels accumulates to such
as to constitute cedema. ;

It is therefore evident that the tissues play a part that has hitherto been uni
nized in the production of cedema. &

Complete anemia and hemostasis, however, not only produce an effect
tissues of a limb; they must also have some effect upon the blood-vessels, ar
