Lost time of the galvanometer to a current of 0001 volt, and to a weak break induction shock.

purpose. At most I have ventured to compare by this means the lost times of make
and of break of light, and have found that whereas in the first stage no gross
difference is to be detected, in the second stage the lost time of make considerably
exceeds the lost time of break—by a gross difference that is to be measured in
seconds, and that I have spoken of as the period of hesitation.

Once recognised, the fact of a struggle of opposite effects taking place at the make
of light is recognisable in another form that occasionally presents itself, viz., as an
initial + interrupted by a brief —, and then passing into the large + of make.
