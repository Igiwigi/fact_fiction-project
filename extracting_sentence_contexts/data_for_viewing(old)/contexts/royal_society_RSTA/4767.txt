nSDBD system.

A few sets of RCM experiments with ignition of combustible mixtures by nSDBD have recently
been presented in the literature [8,9]. The experiments were carried out in a methane-oxygen
mixture (ER =0.3, 0.5 and 1) diluted by Ar (71-77%) for initial temperatures T = 900-1000 K
and pressures P = 14-16 atm; and in an n-butane-oxygen stoichiometric mixture diluted by 77%
of N2 or Ar (T =600-900K and P =6-10atm). For all the experiments, at voltage amplitude
exceeding a certain threshold, a stable multi-point ignition with a following flame propagation
has been observed. At these conditions, typical energy per one streamer/filament, that is for one
combustion kernel, was estimated as 5-20 J for stoichiometric mixtures [9]. It should be noted
that deposited energy measured for methane-containing mixtures with different stoichiometries
is visibly (more than one order of magnitude) different, although theoretically calculated energy
branching in the discharge is practically the same. This fact confirms that the experimental study
of the discharges in combustible mixtures at elevated pressures is a very important issue for
understanding of physics and chemistry of PAC.

At the same time, the current knowledge about the nSDBD development in non-combustible
mixtures is scarce. This section summarizes the information about the nanosecond surface DBD
discharge in air at P = 1-6 atm at voltage amplitude 20-60 kV on the electrode. All the presented
data were obtained in coaxial geometry electrodes in a single-shot regime.

The ICCD images of three typical cases are given in figure 5c. The first (1 atm, +20 kV) case
corresponds to ‘traditional’ morphology of nanosecond surface discharge with the only difference
that the geometry is coaxial. The velocity of the streamer propagation is in a good correlation with
