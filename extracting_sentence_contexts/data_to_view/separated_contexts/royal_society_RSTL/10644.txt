To remove the residual magnetisn
Za reverse force of oyer 40 units was necessary. A noticeable feature in this case is
= the smallness of the hysteresis when the magnetising force was withdrawn and
reapplied, The © off” and © on” curyes for these operations are almost coincident.
-2 In fact, 80 far as this point is concerned, MAXwELL's extension of WEBER's theory
hz 2($ 3) would serve satisfactorily enough to explain the magnetic retentiveness of this
S material. Figs. 8, 9 and 10 are all drawn to the same scale, which is also the scale
