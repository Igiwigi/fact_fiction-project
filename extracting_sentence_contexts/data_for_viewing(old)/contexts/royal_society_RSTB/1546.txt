Breeding and Gestation.

It is remarkable how little is known of the breeding habits of monkeys. In India,
where several species abound close to native villages at all times of the year, it might
be expected that their habits at least should be well known.

BranprorD (No. 1), in his recent work on the Fauna of British India, says there
is no particular breeding season for M. cynomolgus, but I can find no other reference
to the subject in his book.

Mr. SAnyAt, Superintendent of the Zoological Gardens at Calcutta, told me it was
his opinion that JZ. rhesus bred at all times of the year. No doubt he has received
individuals which have borne young at widely different seasons, and it was this fact,
T believe, which led him to adopt his view ; but that fact, in itself, is no proof that
the animals breed at all times of the year in all parts cf the continent of India. The
specimens received at the Gardens may have been obtained from different parts of the
country, where climatic and other conditions (such as food) are very different, and
this cireumstance would be quite sufficient to account for the widely different seasons
during which the young are born at the Gardens.

Dr. Arrcntson has informed me that in Simla J. rhesus copulates about October
and gives birth about August and September the following year. Apparently, then,
these animals have a definite breeding season in Simla.

My own investigations show that the M. rhesus, which live on the plains about
