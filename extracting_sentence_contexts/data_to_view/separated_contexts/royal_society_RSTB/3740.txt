In Plate 7, fig. 3, it is seen, as was pointed out by Erwi Hout (20), that in
longitudinal section, while the sheath of Neumann is very evident, with suitable
staining, in the calcified portion of the dentine, it is not to be seen in the odonto-
genetic zone where the tubes appear to have no definite walls. The figure shows

this very distinctly in a section of a young growing tooth where the uncalcified zone
is of great width, the section being a portion of the same preparation as that from
which fig. 1 was taken. H6un1 considers that this fact points to “ the dependence
of the sheath of Neumann on calcified dentine substance.” We might perhaps carry
this statement further and suggest that this sheath of the tubes is concerned in the
calcifying process, and may serve as a dialysing membrane through which dialysis
takes place. In developing enamel a membrane has been described between the ameloblast cells
and the forming enamel, and also between the enamel cells and the stratum inter-
medium of the enamel organ, The existence of membranes in these situations has
been the subject of much controversy. Mr.
