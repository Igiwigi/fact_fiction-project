This result must be connected with the fact that from these metals the radiation
differs considerably from the primary which produces it, while from paper and
aluminium the radiation bears a much closer resemblance to the primary.

In addition to these experiments many changes were made in the apparatus
without affecting the results described. Three or four different X-ray tubes were
used to produce the radiation, though all were of the same type,* the sizes of
apertures were varied considerably, the whole apparatus was taken down and
reconstructed, and the distances between screens were varied.

Having given the experimental evidence that the variation in intensity was due
simply to the fact that from certain light radiators placed in such a primary beam the
intensity of secondary radiation depended on the position of a plane passing through
the axis of the beam and fixed relative to the bulb, the maxima and minima being in
directions at right angles, that is, that the primary beam is partially polarised, we
will consider some of the results a little more in detail.

Many experiments were made with paper or cardboard as the radiator, and not one
failed to give evidence of polarisation in the manner described.

Table L. gives an example of readings obtained.

As will be seen from these results, there was a small variation in the ratio of the
deflexions of the electroscopes when all controllable conditions were kept the same,
