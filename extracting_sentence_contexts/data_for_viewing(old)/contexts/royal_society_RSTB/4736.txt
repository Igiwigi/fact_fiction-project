31. Scutellera nobilis, Fasr. (India), Hemiptera.

A number of tropical Scutelleridze show the brightest and most varied colours,
portions of a small area of the scutellum being red, green, and purple at the same
angle. The colours are also very changeable, and can be made to vary in specimens
preserved in alcohol by the mere traces of grease that come from the fingers in handling.
A section of the scutellum of the above insect is shown in Plate 2, fig. 10. There is
a surface cuticle, c, on a deep layer of chitin, which if partially depigmented by
sodium hypochlorite, shows a roughly striated structure. It is impossible that this
structure can take any part in the production of colour, as is the case with the two
following examples, because S. nobilis and similar bugs are peculiar for the rapidity
with which all colour disappears at the first attempt to polish them. The cuticle is
liable to frill with great ease, as is shown in the figure. In fact, it seemed so possible
that, in spite of its thinness, this film might be divided into layers of air and chitin,
that renewed attempts were made to alter the colour by pressure and by placing
in vacuo, but without success. â€˜Thus it appears that chitin may frill in this way,
though the layers were previously in optical contact. If the colour is due to selective
metallic reflection, it is destroyed so easily by polishing that it seems possible the
colour-producing layer is on the surface instead of under a protecting cuticle.

Among similar bugs examined was Chrysocoris stockerus, Lixn. (India), the
structure of which was exactly the same.
