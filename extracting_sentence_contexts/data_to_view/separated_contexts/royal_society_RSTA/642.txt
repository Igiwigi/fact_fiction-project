According to Pauli:

As this indeterminacy [that reflected in the uncertainty relations] is an unavoidable element
of every initial state of a system [a quantum object] that is at all possible according to
the new [quantum-mechanical] law, the development of the system even can never be
determined as was the case in classical mechanics. The theory predicts only the statistics of
the results of an experiment, when it is repeated under a given condition. Like the ultimate
fact without any cause, the individual outcome of a measurement is, however, in general not
comprehended by laws. This must in general be the case, if quantum or wave mechanics is
interpreted as a rational generalization of classical physics [mechanics], which take into
account the finiteness of the quantum of action [Planckâ€™s constant, h]. The probabilities
occurring in the new laws have then to be considered to be primary, which means not
deducible from deterministic [causal] laws.
