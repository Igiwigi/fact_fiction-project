A function of
#he above-mentioned form may, for shortness, be termed a symmetric function of the
0 ; such function (disregarding an arbitrary factor depending on the common factors
Swhich enter implicitly into the different sets of roots) will be a rational and integral
nction of the coefficients of the equations, 4. 6. any symmetric function of the roots
Smay be considered as a rational and integral function of the coefficients. The general
=process for the investigation of such expression for a symmetric function of the roots
Zis indicated in Professor ScnLirl's Memoir, © Ueber die Resultante eines Systemes
RQmehrerer algebraischer Gleichungen,” Vienna 'Fransactions, t. iv. (1852). The process is
as follows :—Suppose that we know the resultant of a system of equations, one or more of
them being linear; then if p=0 be the linear equation or one of the linear equations of
the system, the resultant will be of the form @,@,.., where $,, @,, &c. are what the
function © becomes upon substituting therein the different sets (41, 41, 21+), (V2 Yar ++)
of the remaining (@—1) equations 4=0, ,=0, &c.; comparing snch expression with
the given value of the resultant, we have expressed in terms of the coefficients of the
functions 4, x, &ec., certain symmetric functions which may be called the fundamental
symmetric functions of the roots of the system þ=0, y=0, &c. ; these are in fact the
symmetric functions of the first degree in respect to each set of roots. By the aid of
these fundamental symmetric functions, the other symmetric functions of the roots of
the system 4=0, %=0, &c. may be expressed in terms of the coefficients, and then com-

bining with these equations a non-linear equation Þ=0, the resultant of the 8ystem
Þ=0, 4=0, ;=0, &c. will be what the function Þ,®,... becomes, upon substituting

the expressions for these functions in terms of the coefficients. We thus pass from the
resultant of a 8ystem p=0, þ=0, ;=0, &c., to that of a system Þ=0, =0, ,=0, &.,
in which the linear function @ is replaced by the non-linear function Þ.
