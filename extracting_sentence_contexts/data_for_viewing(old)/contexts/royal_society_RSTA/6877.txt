tion Methods (cf. Southwell 1940, §§ 17-20 and 266) is the tentative nature of its
approach: any device may be employed to find a trial solution, since the subsequent
treatment will take account of errors; and in particular (cf. §21) rough plottings can
be used in parallel with numerical computations, even when these aim at much higher
accuracy.

Again, an apparently complete liquidation of residuals may prove to be incomplete
when advance is made to a finer net. In such circumstances (cf. § 34) a multiplying
factor may be used to ensure that the residuals, on the finer net, have a zero total: then
positive and negative residuals will be equally common, and relatively little further
relaxation will be required to liquidate them.

Finally, advantage can often be taken of the fact that (since the governing equation
is linear) solutions can be superposed. As remarked in § 1, biharmonic analysis would be
(relatively) simple if the boundary conditions permitted us to determine V2w as a
first stage in the solution, because the deduction of w can be effected without difficulty,
once V*w is known, by the methods of Part III. Similarly, ifwe have V2w approximately
(from a solution effected by the methods of this paper), then we can without difficulty
deduce a solution w which satisfies very closely both the governing equation and either one of the
two boundary conditions. The other boundary condition will not (in general) be satisfied
exactly, but it will be satisfied approximately; so the supplementary function required
to complete our solution will be a biharmonic function which is everywhere small,
therefore need not be determined with very high accuracy.
