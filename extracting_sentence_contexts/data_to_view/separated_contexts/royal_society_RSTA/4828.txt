Natural subsystems are generally not immediately evident from either Boolean networks or
finite-state automaton descriptions. Knowing a model’s generators or transition diagram fully
describes it, but this gives almost no insight into its structure and no higher level insight into how
it functions. This is analogous to the fact that writing down a system of differential equations
does not by itself yield understanding of a system’s orbit and stability structure, local and global
dynamics, etc. Studying the transformation semigroup of this lac operon model reveals exactly two non-
trivial natural subsystems. These structures were calculated in a few seconds using our
computational algebra system SGPDEC [16-18] together with the weak control relationship
between the two.
