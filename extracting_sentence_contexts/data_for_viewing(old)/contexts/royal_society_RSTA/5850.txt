physically, as to convince one that the actual universe has a more exotic topology but
only that such a possibility is not strictly excluded by current observations. However, it
is intriguing to investigate the possibility that there may be a dynamical reason, provided
by Einstein’s equations, for the observed fact that the universe seems to be at least locally
homogeneous and isotropic and that this mechanism may therefore allow an attractive logical
alternative to simply extrapolating observations of necessarily limited scope to the universe as
a whole.

But what are the (compact, connected, orientable) 3-manifolds available for consideration?
This question has been profoundly clarified in recent years by the dramatic progress on lower-
dimensional topology made possible through the advancements in Ricci flow [4,5]. One now
knows for example that, since the Poincaré conjecture has finally been proven, any such
3-manifold M that is in fact simply connected must be diffeomorphic to the ordinary 3-sphere
S°. Setting aside this so-called ‘trivial’ manifold the remaining possibilities consist of an infinite
list of non-trivial manifolds, each of which is diffeomorphic (designated herein by ~) to a finite
connected sum of the following form:

3 st
M~ pit ene x S$!) #.4(S? x S!)#K(z, 1)1#.4#K(20, Dn (1.1)
1 k


Here k,] and m are integers > 0, k + 1+ m>1 and if either k, | or m is 0 then terms of that type do
not occur. The connected sum M#N of two closed connected, oriented n-manifolds is constructed
by removing the interiors of an embedded closed n-ball in each of M and N and then identifying
