High productivity has
this effect because of the (up to) twofold advantage of produ-
cing all-female offspring via parthenogenesis (i.e. the
so-called twofold cost of sex [3]). This advantage explains
why female bias at the core does not evolve at low values
of « (figure 3a): lower parthenogenetic output inhibits the
rapid spread of resistance alleles, thereby generating weaker
epistasis. The fact that sex bias fails to evolve at lower
values of ¢ (figure 3a) even though core populations are
equally dense across all values of « (figure 3c) suggests
that high productivity rather than high density per se favours
epistasis at the core. Female bias fails to evolve at the core when resistance alleles
are neutral and therefore sexual coevolution does not occur
(figure 4; electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Removing costs of resistance and costs of coercion has a similar
effect (figure 4) because coercion alleles fix in the absence of
costs and males subsequently succeed in all mating attempts.
