on cooling becomes opalescent, and in moderately strong solutions is very viscous.
The aqueous solution gives no colour with iodine.

The following estimations were carried out on samples of luteose dried to constant
weight in vacuo.

1. Ash.—0-1815 gm. gave 0-0003 gm. ash corresponding to 0-16 per cent.

2. Acidity.—Luteose is definitely neutral in reaction, since with 0-2351 gm. a single
drop of N/10 sodium hydroxide was sufficient to render the solution alkaline to phenol-
phthalein.

3. Optical Rotation.—Luteose is markedly lavorotatory. Because of the fact that its
aqueous solution is slightly opalescent in the cold the optical rotation was determined
in a jacketed tube at 90°C. 0-5248 gm. was dissolved in 50 c.c. of water and polarised
in a 20 cm. tube at 90° C. The average of a large number of readings obtained was

— 0-886° for the mercury yellow light corresponding to [a]i? “soy = — 42°2°, and
—0-974° for the mercury green light corresponding to [a] fi) Gosn = — 46°4°.

4. Hydrolysis by boiling dilute acid.—-4819 gm. of luteose was hydrolysed by
boiling for six hours with 10-03 ¢.c. of N/1 H,SO,. The hydrolysis mixture was cooled
and titrated with N/1 NaOH of which 10-10 c.c. were required, thus indicating that
no acid was formed during the hydrolysis. The mixture was made up to 49-92 c.c.,
filtered, and the glucose content estimated :—
