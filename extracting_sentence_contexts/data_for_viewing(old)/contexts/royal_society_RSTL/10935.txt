183. Hence if $' be a factor 8ystem of S, there are no units of 8” which are
duplicates with respect to S. And if there are units of S' which are duplicates with
respect to S, then S' is not a factor 8ystem of S. Further, if S' be not a factor s8ystem
of 8, there are units of 8” which are duplicates with respect to S, unless S and S”
are replicas of each other. And if there are no units of S' which are duplicates with
respect to S, then $S' is a factor system of S, unless S and $S' are replicas of each other.

184. If S' be a factor system of S, each single system of S' musb be 80 also. For if
m;\ be the number of self-correspondences of $S," a single system of S', we have
m\ þ m,1e., mm Þ mm < p,.e., mM < Þ.

185. If S' be a factor system of 8, i is also a factor system of A, the single system
eomposed of the unified aspects of 8. This follows immediately from the fact that the
combined system $, A has the same number of self-correspondences-as S has.

186, Hence also every single system of S', a factor system of S, must be a factor
system of A.

187. A system which has no factor systems, except systems of one unit, may be
termed a prime 8y8tem.

188. If 8” is a factor system of S', and &' is a factor system of S, then S” is a factor
system of S, For let a”, b” units of 8” be duplicates with respect to S ; then we
have &"S >—<0”"S. Now if ec be any unit of 8”, there must be a unit d' such that
«WS >——< bd'S; and since S' is a factor of S, we cannot have e'S >—<4'S, unless
