+2fgh. The Hessian and the cubic intersect in an indecomposable curve, which is the spinode
curve; that is, spinode curve is a complete intersection 3 x 4; o'=12. The equations of the spinode curve may be written in the simplified form
W(a, b, &, f, g, XX, Y, 2)*+2&XYZ=0,
—8KXYZW
+81XYZ(af X+bgY +chZ)
—E{ ON +DPY + OD) — 20Y P72 — 2ca72X2— 20bX*Y*}=0;
and it, appears hereby that the node C, is a sixfold point on the curve, the tangents of
the curve in fact coinciding with the six rays. Fach of the 15 lines touches the spinode curve twice; in fact, for the line 12 we
have X=0, W=0; and substituting in the equations of the 8pinode curve, we have
(3Y*—eZ?)=0; that is, we have the two points of contact X=0, W=0, Y/I=+Zy/e.

Hence B'=30. Reciprocal Surface,
