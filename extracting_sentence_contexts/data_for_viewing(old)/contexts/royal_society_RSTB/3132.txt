232 DR. G. J. BURCH ON CASES OF COLOUR-BLINDNESS.

Of the four principal colours, violet is the one about which there is most uncer-
tainty. The name appears to be associated in the popular mind with purple rather
than the violet of the spectrum. One often hears the remark, “ Real violet has more
red in it.” In point of fact, the flowers and paints and dyes called “violet”
invariably give a spectrum containing red rays. But this colour, whatever be the
name given to it, is recognised by the majority as. one of the principal colours of the
spectrum.

Minute care in giving names to all the gradations of tint between red and green,
or even throughout the entire spectrum, is no proof that the colour sensations are
normal, I have known a man give Newron’s seven colours quite correctly, and
five minutes afterwards, when shown the F-line under a much higher power, call it
“pink.” One of EprrpGe-GREEN’s tests—and it is a very effective one—for colour-
blindness, is founded on the fact that lowering the illumination will often completely
throw a man out if he does not really possess the sensations necessary to discriminate
between two colours.
