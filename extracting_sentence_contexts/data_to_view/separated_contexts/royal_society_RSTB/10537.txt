Probability (RT < t) of RT on no-stop-signal trials and on non-
cancelled (signal respond) error trials with stop-signal delay (SSD) equal to
231, 364 and 496 ms. RT on non-cancelled trials was systematically shorter
than RT on no-stop-signal trials and increased with SSD, beginning at
common minima and ending with shorter maxima.

are the same qualitatively, but they differ quantitatively,
and the quantitative differences reveal important changes or
deficits in cognitive control.

3. Independent race model

Two facts led to the independent race model of stop-signal per-
formance: (i) the probability of response inhibition depends on
the time available to detect the stop signal before the Go
response is executed and (ii) non-cancelled RTs are faster
than RTs on no-stop-signal trials. These characteristics are
found in the large majority but not all studies of countermand-
ing [6,7]. These two facts suggested that response inhibition
depends on the outcome of a race between a GO process,
initiated by the Go stimulus, and a STOP process, initiated
by the stop signal.
