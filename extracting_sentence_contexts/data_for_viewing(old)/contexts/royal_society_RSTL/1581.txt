Ã¾ snazs beg permission to lay before the Society the account
of some experiments on a compound of oxymuriatic gas and
Oxygene gas, which, I trust, will be found:to illustrate an mter-
esting branch of chemical enquiry, and which offer some ex-
traordinary and novel results.

I was led to make these experiments in |consequence' of
the difference between the properties of oxymuriatic gas pre-
pared in different modes; it would occupy a great length of
time to state the whole progress of this investigation, It will,
I conceive, be more. interesting that I should immediately
refer to. the facts; most of which have been witnessed by
Members of this Body, belonging to the Committee of Che-
mistry of the Royal Institution.

The oxymuriatic gas prepared from manganese, either by
mixing it with a muriate and acting upon it by sulphuric acid,
or by mixing\it with muriatic acid, is when the oxide of man-
ganese is pure, and, whether collected over water or mercury,
uniform in its properties; its colour is a pale yellowish green;
water takes up about twice its volume ; and -scarcely gains
any colour; the metals burn in it readily ; it combines with
hydrogene without any deposition of moisture: it does not
