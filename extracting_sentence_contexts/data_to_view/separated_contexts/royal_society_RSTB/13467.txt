After
the PD game, gossip could be sent to a randomly selected partici-
pant (figure 1 or screen 3 in electronic supplementary material,
$2). In each round, participants could send two messages. The
fictitious names of gossip targets and receivers were displayed
on the screen. Participants could select the valence of gossip
from three options indicated by happy, neutral and sad emoti-
cons. We have employed emoticons as they simplify and clarify
the content of reputation scores and translate evaluations into
positive, neutral or negative judgement.
