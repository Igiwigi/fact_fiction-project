After this, on taking the
record of the transmitted effect of stimulus, I found that the block of conduction was
still persistent. The conducting power of the benumbed tissue is thus paralysed for a
period which generally lasts for about 45 minutes. I have, however, discovered the
very suggestive fact that the lost conducting power can be very quickly restored by
subjecting the paralysed portion of the petiole to the action of tetanising electric
shocks. N 2
