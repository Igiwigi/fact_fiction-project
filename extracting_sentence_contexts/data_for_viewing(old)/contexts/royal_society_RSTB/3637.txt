fibres which they examined. But there can be little or none of this substance in the
giant fibre sheath of Halla and Arenicola, for osmic acid has little darkening effect
on the substance of the sheath in either of these cases.

é Methods. .

After prolonged trial observations on various Annelids I decided that, of these,
Halla afforded the best opportunities for the investigation of the giant cells and
giant fibres. Preparations were made according to the method of Gotat, but without
the least success, a result identical with that obtained by von Lennosskx, Reratus
(see p. 440), and, in fact, everyone who has attempted to investigate these elements
by this method. Various methods of preservation and staining were tried in the hope
of obtaining a clear differentiation of the elusive fibrill in these remarkable elements,
but for a period of nearly five years without any really satisfactory result. I devoted
much time while in Naples, in 1900 and again in 1906, to the iéra-vitam staining
of specimens of Halla, or portions of its nerve cord, with methylene blue, but this
treatment proved totally ineffectual, although numerous modifications were made in
regard to the strength of the solution employed and its mode of application. The
staining fluid was in some cases injected into the living animal and allowed to act
for varying periods before the nerve cord was examined ; in other cases, portions
of the nerve cord were dissected out and placed in solutions of methylene
blue of various strengths, but with the invariable result that the giant cells
and fibres were either unaffected or small portions of the giant fibres were stained
