s is abstracting from the blood not so much water as some of the solid

S.specific gravity of the venous blood of the whole system actually sinks. For
ison I regard the last given as the most probable explanation of what is
fedly a fact, though not one commonly observed. A rise in the specific

Gefore conclude that the influence of an increase of venous pressure in a limb
stasis is to raise the specific gravity of the venous blood in that limb, and to
degree than before hemostasis, and also, as a rule, to raise the specific
the venous blood in the system at large, though this is not always the case.

approximate to the specific gravity of the arterial blood in the body as a whole.
