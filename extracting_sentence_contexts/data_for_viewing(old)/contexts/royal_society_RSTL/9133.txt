to place ourselves, by an effort of imagination, in the position of chemists who should
have a very varied and extensive knowledge of the chemical properties of the compounds
of carbon, and yet be totally unaware of the existence of that element. Let us imagine,
then, some unknown world, some Laputa (devoted to philosophy) in which the chemistry

of the symbols of the units of matter? Two units of marsh-gas (they would 8ay) are
identical with three units of hydrogen and a unit of acetylene. Having solved asimilar
