with a type specimen, as no material was available for sections, Plate 2, fig. 15a,
shows a portion of a scale in plan, There is a cuticle, ¢, and a faint striation on the
surface. The whole body of the scale is covered with innumerable criss-cross
striations, which give the effect of the strings of a number of superimposed tennis-
rackets. In cross-section, figs. 15) and ¢, these striations are equally clearly shown
in the body of the scale, and the space between the lines is very variable, being from
1‘Op to 0°3n. The undulation seen in the cuticle produces the coarse striation on the
surface. Asa rule the scales are slightly convex, and closely resemble the pilgrim’s
scallop shell.

Plate 2, fig. 15) shows a section mounted in glycerol made through the root of
one of the same scales. At this point many of the scales are almost mushroom
shaped, owing to the fact that the root, b, instead of being at the base of the scale,
is affixed some way towards the middle. The relation of the striation to the
colour has been discussed (p. 12), and reasons have been given for the belief that the
colour, though it may be associated with diffraction, is produced partly by inter-
ference.

(g) Other Iridescent Insects, Hairs, Feathers, ete.

A few other iridescent insects were chosen at random, and sections were made
from the wings and other portions of certain Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Odonata, ete.
Most of the sections closely resembled the type of wing-case found in scaleless beetles
like C. aurata, and a few examples are given.
