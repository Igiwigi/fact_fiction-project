It
will thus be seen that, while in the dog it is necessary to make the movements of the
cords less energetic, by putting the animal rather deeply under the influence of ether,
in the cat, whose cords are, as a rule, very much less vigorous in their movements,
the effect can be best obtained in moderate narcosis. Even in those cats where the
of the stage of

cords were constantly kept in a position of abduction regardl
narcosis, this effect could always be evoked, as is well shown in fig, 14, from which
it may be seen that, while the cords were motionless in abduction before the

stimulus was applied to the cortex, excitation of the proper focus immediately
resulted in active movements of the cords, which continued as long as the excitation
lasted.

8. Spencer’s Area of Arrest of Respiration——As in the dog, so in the cat,
excitation of this area on the olfactory lobe, between the olfactory tract and rhinal
fissure in front, and with the groove for the sylvian artery bounding it posteriorly,
resulted in arrest of the movements of the vocal cords ; but, instead of being arrested
in the expiratory position, as in the case of the dog, the cords were arrested in
abduction, 7.e., the position which they occupy in the inspiratory stage of respiration
(see fig. 13), a fact in keeping with Spencer’s results, for he found that excitation of
this area in the cat resulted in arrest of respiration in inspiration as a rule. What has been said with regard to slowing of the movements of the cords in the
dog holds good for the cat also, and need not be repeated here. VIL.
