4. Assembly of cells seen as tissues: cortex anomalies and ageing

The circumvolutions of the brain, called gyri, appear approximately at four months post
fertilization for human fetuses. A number called the gyrification index is defined to characterize
this shape instability. It is a number measuring the ratio between the outer surface of the cortex
versus the averaged middle surface of the cortex layer. It is closed to 1 for smooth brain (rodents),


around 2.6 for babies and 5 for dolphins. Recently, the bilayer model has encountered some
success for the prediction of the gyrification index of the brain [43,44,98]. This model is based on
simple ingredients. It assumes that the grey and white matter can be considered as two hyper-
elastic layers in growth and that the origin of cortex gyrification comes from the differential
growth between these two layers. A growth anisotropy in the grey matter originates from the fact
that stem cell differentiation and differentiated cell proliferation occur simultaneously, in fetal life.
The main assumption is only a differential and anisotropic volumetric growth of two gel layers
(grey and white matter) with the added hypothesis that white matter is slightly stiffer than grey
matter. These assumptions lead to a super-critical bifurcation in growth modelling. Except for the
case of brain pathologies, this two-layer model recapitulates the gyrification index in fetal life
quantitatively [44] by comparison with data compiled by [99,100] and new magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) studies for fetuses and pre-term newborns [101]. The model explains standard
global pathologies as polymicrogyry (excess of cortical folds) and lissencephaly (lack of cortical
folds).

Another challenge to raise is how to explain the existence of local creases in the cortex and
their possible link to pathologies. If local creases have been observed in experiments involving
