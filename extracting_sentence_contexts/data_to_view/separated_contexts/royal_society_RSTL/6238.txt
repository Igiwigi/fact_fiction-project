The more fayourably the con-
Z ducting materials may be disposed in the geological strata of a district, the greater the
2 value of the current-drift along the same may be expected to be. Where the materials
Sare of inferior conducting power and ill arranged, there will the current that is present
'Z have a lower value. In fact these currents travel, as might be anticipated, in the con-
Z Aucting mass of the earth, just as they travel in all other conductors, and adjust and
2 distribute themselves according to the known laws of resistance.
