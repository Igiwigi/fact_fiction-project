Moreover, it is possible that the spherules
in a cell coalesce to form one mass. The inulin casts are easily freed from the cell-
walls enclosing them, and float about independently with the starch grains embedded
in them (fig. 4). That the casts are in the main really inulin, follows from the fact
that both the sections of the spirit material and the prepared snowdrop inulin
respond to the tests, and also from the fact that the solubility of the casts pursues
the same course as that of the prepared substance (see Section 6). In distilled water at a temperature of about 62° the casts in the sections remain
intact, although the starch grains in them swell, and the liquid is rendered blue
with iodine solution. They do not begin to dissolve till a temperature of about 80°
is reached.
