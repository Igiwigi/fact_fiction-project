Boor, while exhibiting in a clearer light the data that are necessary for any
inference, and the limitations of inference caused by assigned limitations of data.

The whole of the conditions of consistence are derived from one source, or one
condition only, viz., that no frequency can be less than zero. But as it is evident that
if all the frequencies of any order be greater than zero, the frequencies of all lower
orders must, @ fortiori, be greater than zero, we may limit the above statement by
saying that all the conditions of consistence are covered by the dictum that no
ultimate frequency* can be less than zero. If, however, we are dealing with groups of
the nth and lower orders only in m specified attributes, it is convenient to divide
the conditions into two classes—(1) the “inferior conditions of consistence,” which may
be derived from the fact that no nth order frequency can be less than zero; (2) the
“superior conditions of consistence” which can only be derived from the consideration
that frequencies of order greater than n cannot be less than zero.

A distinction of this sort is, it may be noted, made by De Morcan. Inferences
drawn from the inferior conditions of consistence for second order groups he terms
spurious inferences ;+ they do not really follow from given premises (7.¢., given values
of (AB) and (AC) or (AB) and (BC), &c.), but are “true by the constitution of the
universe.”

my previous memoir.
