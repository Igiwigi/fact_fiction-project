'= There are therefore two different and independent subjects of experiment. The one

& and the earth. The fact of such an alteration is independent of the form under which
EZ we accept the theory of undulations, and the possibility of establishing its existence de-
*S pends on the discovery of lines in the stellar spectra, indicating by their arrangement that
A their origin is due to the existence of substances in the star having the same properties

period of vibration of rays, if snfficiently exact, will enable us to verify the theory, and
of approach or separation between the earth and any star.
