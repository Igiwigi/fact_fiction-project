16 SIR J. F. W. HERSCHEL ON THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF THE

most energetic in the reduction of argentine compounds are those which have been
hitherto regarded as extra-spectral, or as lying beyond all visible illumination on the
more refrangible side, is a proposition familiar to photologists. How far this opinion
is strictly correct I shall take occasion presently to examine. It has also, on the
ground of Dr. WorLLasrTox's experiments on guaiacum, been received, that the less re-
frangible end of the spectrum produces chemical changes of a certain kind ; but as
that eminent philosopher found changes apparently of the same kind, in that 8ub-
stance, to be operated by a gentle heat, unaccompanied with light, and as those
changes were, in consequence, referred by him to the calorific rays, which we know
to accompany that end of the spectrum, rather than to any peculiar chemical action,
this point must be considered as hitherto undecided. The facts about to be tated,
however, leave no further doubt on the subject.

50. The experiments described in my first communication on this subject, in which
coloured and other media were used to analyse the incident light by absorption, are
quite sufficient to show a high probability at least that the chemical energy is distri- ,
buted throughout the spectrum in such a way as to be, by no means, a mere function
of the refrangibility, but to stand in relation to other physical qualities, both of the ray
and of the analysing medium, and that relation by no means the same as that which
determines the absorptive action of the latter on the colorific rays. The experiments I
am about to describe will show that there is also a third set of relations concerned in
this action, and most materially influencing both the amount and character of the
chemical action at each point of the spectrum, viz. those depending on the physical
