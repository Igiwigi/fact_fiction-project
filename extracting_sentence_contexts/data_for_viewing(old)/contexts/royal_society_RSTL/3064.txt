ments too far, which were not made with the moſt
accurate inſtruments ; and this may have given oc-
cafion to his learned countryman M. DE LA LANDE, |
to ſuppole that this curve may rather exhibit the de-
viations of his experiments from thetruth, than any
thing which really obtains in nature), His general |
hypotheſis, however, of a difference of abfolute |
eJaſticity, in different parts of the atmoſphere, muſt
obtain, whenever the temperatures of ſuch different
parts are unequal; unleſs the effe& of the inequality
of temperature were to be compenſated by the ſyn-
chronous unequal operations of ſome other caule,
'Fhat it does in fact obtain, when the temperature
is unequal, is proved, beyond 'a doubt, inſtead of
being refuted, by M. pe Luc's experiments; and
this is to be conſidered, as a further inſtance of their
exa& agreement with the genuine concluſions of
accurate theory.
