where e is the charge on an ion, / is PLANCK’s constant and e and V are in the same
absolute units. By using very large photo-electric currents, points such as D can be
determined with great accuracy and comparative ease, whereas increasing the magnitude
of the emission does not diminish the inaccuracies to which determinations of points
like A are liable.

Data to which this second method can be applied were obtained in connection with
the Series I. x COCI, of 3/8/1916 (p. 12). Observations at the end of this series showed
that with the blue filter the photo-electric saturation current was 248 divisions per
minute, and that with the green filter it was only 0-6 div./min. At the same time the
chemical saturation current was 4-0 divs./min., a capacity of 0-01 mfd. being included
in each of these measurements. The pressure of the reaction products had risen to
0-016 mm. at this stage. The fact that the blue light of wave-length 4347-4358 and

frequency 6-89 x 10" gave a large deflection shows that this frequency was considerably
higher than the threshold value. If the small value of the current with \ 5460, fre-
quency 5-49 x 10" could be relied on as genuine, it would establish » as very close to
d 5460 and just on the low-frequency side of it. On the other hand, if this small deflec-
tion is spurious or due to a trace of light of higher frequency mixed with the \ 5460,
the threshold value must be well on the low-frequency side of \ 4350 on account of the
large deflection given by \ 4350. This experiment shows that » was somewhere
between 5-49 x 10" and 6-89 x 10" at this stage. A plot of the photo-electric data
