The house is built of stone, and the dial, now in the possession of the Royal So-
ciety, was marked on a large stone in the south wall at the angle of the building,
and about six feet from the ground, and which was reduced to its present dimensions
for the convenience of carriage. The name of Newron, with the exception of the
first two letters, which haye been obliterated by the hand of time, will, on close in-
spection, appear to have been inscribed under the dial in rude and capital letters.
There is also another dial marked on the wall, smaller than the former, and not
in such good preservation. The above are the only dials about the house which I
have been able to discover, nor can I find by inquiry on the spot that more ever
existed, though some of NewrTox's biographers assert that there were several. An
opinion has always prevailed that the dials now in being were executed by NewroN's
own hand when a boy, which appears probable from the well-known fact, that at a
very early period of his life he discovered a genius for mechanical contrivances,
evinced more particularly by the construction of a windmill of his own invention,
and a clock to go by water applied to its machinery. Finding, however, this latter
contrivance (however ingenious) to fail in keeping accurate time, it is not improbable,
that with a view to secure that object, he formed with his own hands the two dials in
question ; and very probably the dial now remaining in the wall of the house, from
its inferiority in point of construction to that now in the possession of the Royal
Society, was his first attempt in dial-making. The gnomons of these dials have un-
fortunately disappeared many years, but as they are described in some of the printed
