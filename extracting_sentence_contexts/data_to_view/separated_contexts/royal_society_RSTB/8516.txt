These failures eventually led many in the global health community
to shift their focus from targeted disease-eradication attempts to less explicitly
defined programmes such as providing basic health services. There was a percep-
health and disease and epidemiology tion that eradication programmes, referred to as ‘vertical programmes’, could have
a particularly deleterious impact in inhibiting the development of the basic health
services (so-called ‘horizontal’ or ‘integrated’ programmes). Thus, a proposal to
undertake a global smallpox eradication campaign was a divisive and politically
charged issue, further complicated by the fact that the World Health Organization
(WHO) was reluctant to support another eradication campaign. However, in 1966
the World Health Assembly (WHA) passed a resolution approving an annual
Author for correspondence: budget of $2.4 million to support a 10-year smallpox eradication plan by the
very narrow margin of two votes (58 were needed for approval, it received 60) [1]. Subject Areas:
