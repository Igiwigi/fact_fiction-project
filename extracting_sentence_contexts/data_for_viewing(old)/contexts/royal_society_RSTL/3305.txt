and that transported by torrents, at the level of the ancient waters ; I could perceive
no difference in the nature of the alluvium above and below the upper shelf, as stated
to be the case by Sir Lavper$. It contains fewer well-rounded pebbles at the greater
heights than would have been expected on any theory of the origin of the shelvyes ;
but they are abundant in the lower and broader parts of the valleys. Nevertheless
where there is any level spot at the height of the upper shelyes, well-rounded pebbles
may generally be found, as on the summit of a rounded hill, or a flat little strait
separating some hillock from a line of shelf (for instance near Craigdhn, on the summit
of Meal Roy, and between Upper and Lower Glen Roy). In these cases the pebbles
must have been almost exclusively formed by the action of the currents and waves of
the former expanse of water. They are frequently derived from rocks not found in
the immediate vicinity : erratic boulders also are scattered over these mountains. I
state these facts distinctly, because MaccuLLocn says\ that the compoxsition of the
alluvium of the upper shelves is wholly different from that covering the sides of the
broad valleys; whereas the difference is only one of degree, for which many causes
might be assigned.

I have already observed, that the quantity of solid rock worn away on the line of
any shelf is not usually great. At the narrow entrance, however, of Loch Treig (of
which a drawing is given by Sir Lauper Dick), on the west side, which is yery steep,
the gneiss is worn into 8mooth concaye hollows, the peculiar curves of which, though
