A number of detailed studies were carried out related to the STEREO observations of nanometre-
sized and larger dust near 1 AU [11-17]. The detection process was described and studied in detail
[18], but there are still some open questions. In fact, it is intriguing that, in spite of large time
variations in the observed fluxes, the average fluxes fit well to an extrapolation of the empirical
interplanetary dust flux model [19] to smaller sizes (figure 1). For Cassini, although an analysis
of the plasma wave data during the Cassini cruise towards Jupiter was made only during parts
of the orbit to avoid possibly incurring instrumental effects, it still provided data on nanodust
fluxes at different distances from the Sun. The observed fluxes were found to be consistent with
the assumption that the majority of the nanodust originates from the vicinity of the Sun and then
is accelerated in the solar wind [20].
