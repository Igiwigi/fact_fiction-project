995. That a body which can give way to a current of feeble intensity should giye
way more freely to one of stronger force, and yet inyolve no contradiction to the
law of definite electrolytic action, is perfectly consistent. All the facts and also the
theory I have ventured to put forth, tend to show that the act of decomposition
opposes a certain force to the passage of the electric current ; and that this obstruc-
tion should be overcome more or less readily, in proportion to the greater or less
intensity of the decomposing current, is in perfect consistency with all our notions
of the electric agent. 996. I have elsewhere (947.)
