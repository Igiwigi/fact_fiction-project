a reduction from the four bundles supplying the cotyledon in the Cycads, ete.,* and
may possibly be regarded as a stage towards the reduced vascular supply of the
Angiospermous cotyledon, in which a relic of the paired bundles is still often
traceable in the peculiar V-shaped bundle recorded by various observers. t

The double vascular supply of the “ flowers” in Welwitschia is closely paralleled
among the Cycads,{ where the two bundles supplying the ovules often have a
separate origin from two adjoining bundles of the axis; the arrangement in
Welwitschia is, however, rendered still more complex by the fact that each of the two
bundles here supplying the flower has itself a double origin. But the main course of
the bundles in the cone-axis of the Cyeads and Welwitschia is essentially similar ; to
take a concrete example, Dioon edule may be closely compared with Welwitschia.
The axis of the cone of Dioon§ has several ares of bundles together forming a
regular whorl and the two ends of each are provide the bundles supplying the ovules.
In the median region of the cone the traces entering from the ovules are double, and
they may unite with the same or with separate bundles of the crown, Similarly
other genera of Cycads may be compared with Welwitschia. In Ceratozamia,||
Zamia,’ and Bowenia** two bundles commonly enter from the scales and join two
separate bundles in the axis,
