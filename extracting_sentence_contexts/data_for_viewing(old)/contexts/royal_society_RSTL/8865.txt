192 MR, F. M. BALFOUR ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

whits matter (/,). If the folding that I have 8upposed were to take place, the grey and
white matters would have yery nearly the relative situations which they have in the
Vertebrate spinal cord.

The grey matter would be situated in the interior and surround the epithelium of
the central canal, and the white matter would nearly surround the grey and form the
anterior white commissure. 'The nerves would then arise, not from the sides of the
nervous cord as in existing Vertebrates, but from its extreme ventral summit.

One of the most striking features which I have brought to light with reference to the
development of the posterior roots, is the fact, of their growing out from the extreme
dorsal summit of the neural canalâ€”a position analogous to the ventral summit, of the
Annelidan nervous cord. Thus the posterior roots of the nerves in Elasmobranchs arise
in the exact manner which might have been anticipated were the spinal cord due to
such a folding as I have suggested. The argument from the nerves becomes the
stronger, from the great peculiarity in the position of the outgrowth, a feature which
would be most perplexing without some such 'explanation as I haye proposed. The
central epithelium of the neural canal according to this view represents the external
skin; and its ciliation is to be explained as a remnant of the ciliation of the external
skin now found amongst many of the lower Annelids.

1 have, however, employed the comparison of the Vertebrate and Annelidan nervous
cords, not s0 much to prove a genetic relation between the two as to show the & priori
