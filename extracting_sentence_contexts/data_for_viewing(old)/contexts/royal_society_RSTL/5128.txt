it, and then viewed the slit through the prism. LI saw as far as usual into the violet.
The water was then poured out and replaced by the solution of sulphate of quinine,
which, when viewed by transmitted light, appeared as transparent as the water which
it had replaced. When the tumbler was now placed behind the slit, the blue beam
of dispersed light was observed to extend quite across it, a distance of ahout three
inches, and would evidently have gone much further. On viewing the slit through
the prism, the spectrum was found to be cut off about half-way between the fixed
lines G and H. The termination was pretty definite, which indicates that, at least
Ifor that part of the spectrum, the absorbing energy of the fluid rapidly increased with
he refrangibility of the light ; there was, however, an evident, diminution of intensity
produced by the fluid, extending from the termination of the spectrum to near G.

12. There could no longer be any doubt, either as to the fact of a change of re-
Sfangibility or as to the explanation thereby of the remarkable phenomenon exhi-
Dited by sulphate of quinine. Epipolized light is merely light which has been purged
Sf the invisible, or at most feebly illuminating rays more refrangible than the violet ;
"nd the term itself, which in fact was only adopted provisionally by Sir Jour
AleRSCHEL, and which has now served its purpose, may henceforth be discarded,
"Specially as it is calculated to convey a false impression respecting the cause of the

henomenon. It remained to examine other instances of internal dispersion, of
which, according to Sir Davip BrewsTeR's observyations, the dispersion produced by
Sulphate of quinine is only a particular case; to endeavour to make out the laws
Leconding to which a change of refrangibility takes place; and, if possible, to
Hecount. for these laws on mechanical principles.
