follows the same lines, is far more lengthy, but leads to the same result, 7.e., no gain
by selection of the same amount, oft repeated.

(d.) Secular Natural Selection and Steady Selection. Focus of Regression.—We
thus see that, on the theory with which we are concerned, a knowledge of the ancestry
beyond the parents in no way alters our judgment as to the size of organ or degree of
characteristic probable in the offspring, nor its variability.* An exceptional father
is as likely to have exceptional children if he comes of a mediocre stock as if he comes
of an exceptional stock. The value of { will be no greater nor the value of %, less if
the parents have been selected for p generations than if they have been selected for
one only. This result seems to me somewhat surprising, but I cannot see how it is
to be escaped so long as we assume the normal distribution of frequency, which
appears in so many cases to be a close approximation to fact. It is of course possible

# This seems specially noteworthy ; it would seem natural to suppose that the offspring of a long
selected stock would be less variable than those of one just started—that the offspring of a gradually
created variety would be more stable than those so to speak of a sport. It appears not.

that in some manner repeated selection causes a progression of the “focus of regres-
sion,” by which term I would understand the mean of the general population from
which selection has originally taken place. I have been very careful so far not to
hazard any statement with regard to this focus of regression. I have measured only
