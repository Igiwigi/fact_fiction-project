Equation (16) itself is obvious enough since it merely asserts that H’ has a potential
when there are no currents in the field. But it suggests another question—does the
present theory lead to the ordinary mathematical theory of electromagnetism? It
can be easily shown to do so. The mechanical results when expressed in terms of
H’ and I’ have just been shown to result in the same forces and moments on conductors
and magnets regarded as wholes, as does Maxwett's stress. These are all the
mechanical demands of the ordinary theory. Equation (19), § 61, shows that the
relations between the whole magnetic moment per unit volume, the permanent
magnetic moment per unit volume, and the magnetic force at the point, may on the
present theory, be regarded as the same as in the ordinary theory. Only one other

* Notwithstanding this, and the fact that I have in this paper called the stress of equation (29) the
normal stress, I think equation (28) is to be preferred, partly because of the greater simplicity of the
assumptions which lead to it, and partly because of the greater simplicity of the electrostatical results
flowing from it.

demand is made by the ordinary theory. H’ and A’ on the one hand, must be deter-
mined in terms of C’ and I’, on the other, by means of particular relations,

Let us suppose—merely to get rid of the dashes—the standard position to coincide
