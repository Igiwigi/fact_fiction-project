(iii.) Zero, or any multiple of 8, may occur underneath any of the k, factors Q, ;

(iii. ...) And lastly, zero, or any multiple of 7, may occur underneath any of the &;
factors Q,.

How many such compositions exist ?
We have merely to find the coefficient of «™ in the expansion of

(l4+a+a?+...)§(Ltartat+...)*(l+a%+a%+...)* (l+a'+a%+...)*;

for this is the function which enumerates the compositions which possess these

properties. In fact to form the composition we take a power of # from each of the

first /, factors; then a power of x from each of the next k, factors, observing that

the éxponents of are all zero or multiples of two; then a power of x from the next

k; factors, observing that the exponents are all zero or multiples of three ; and so on,

until finally in the /, factors we find that the exponents are all zero or multiples of 7.
Hence it follows that the operation
