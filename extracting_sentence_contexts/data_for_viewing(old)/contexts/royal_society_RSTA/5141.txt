as external loads on the wind turbine structure and are denoted by {Q;(#)} and {Qw(H},
respectively. Further, an additional generalized load term {Q,Â¢(t)} associated with the rotor
acceleration is derived from the Lagrangian formulation due to the blade-tower interaction. The
total generalized external load vector ({Qext(t)}) on the right-hand side of (2.6) is expressed as

{Qext(t)} = {QL()} + {Qw()} + {Qo(H}. (2.8)

3. Combined active tendon and pitch control

(a) Conventional active pitch control

Pitch control is the most widely used method to regulate the mechanical power generated in wind
turbines [34]. In fact, commercially available wind turbines are nowadays equipped with pitch
control systems to enhance the efficiency of wind energy conversion and to improve the safety of
the plant in case of high wind speeds or emergency situations [35]. Active pitch control is achieved
by rotating each blade about its axis by means of hydraulic or electric actuators appropriately
located inside the wind turbine structure, depending upon the configuration of the active pitch
control system (collective pitch control or individual pitch control). Below rated wind speed, there
is generally no need to vary the pitch angle, since the wind turbine should produce as much
power as possible, though some optimization of energy capture below rated wind speed is also
possible [36]. At high wind speeds, pitch control can be used to prevent excessive mechanical
power production and to limit the power generated to the rated level. In classical designs, PI
(proportional and integral) and PID (proportional, integral and derivative) controllers are used for
wind turbine control applications [36]. The control strategy is designed to provide the demanded
pitch angle f* as a function of the power error, defined as the difference between the rated power
