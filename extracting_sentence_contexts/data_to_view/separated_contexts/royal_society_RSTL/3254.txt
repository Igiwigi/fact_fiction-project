If, then, we sup-
pose that a subsiding sheet of water did actually fill this valley, either of one or more
lakes, with their barrier gradually wearing down, or of an arm of the sea, the general
level of the ocean being stationary during a slow elevation of the land (as now is the
case with the fiords of Scandinavia), every appearance on the sides of the valley of
the Spean and Roy will be explained; and as there is no other way, that I can ee,
of accounting for them, the hypothesis is 80 far worthy of admission. I ought, perhaps, to have previously observed, that these deposits could not have
been formed when the valley was filled with water to the level of the shelves, for the

detritus has the character of matter accumulated in shoal water, and the beds abut
abruptly against the bases of the mountains, instead of blending with the alluvium
on their surface, as would necessarily have happened had the whole been deposited
at the same time at the bottom of one basin. The conclusion, that these valleys have been occupied by a sheet of subsiding water,
follows more plainly from a somewhat different class of facts. I have before re-
marked, that where a streamlet crosses a shelf, especially if it be the lower one, an
obliquely truncated buttress, the form of which was represented by dotted lines in
the wood-cut No. 1, projects from the side of the hill. It is quite evident that these
were accumulated when the sbelf existed as a beach, and the streamlet at present
only acts in removing those portions with which it comes in contact.
