sperms (cf. Malvacese), and it serves to indicate directly that the construction as a
whole is by no means a simple phyllotaxis formation (fig. 15: 5; bud, 0°4 mm. long).


This andreecial region was clearly figured by McNap (1872, p. 512, figs. 3-4): he
termed it the “ primordial staminal cushions.” Srraspurcer (1872, fig. xviii: 8, 3b)
also mistook it for the commencement of the lateral stamens ahead of the others.
With continued regular growth of prophylls and perianth-segments, differentiation of
six low rounded primordia takes place on the andreecial region, while a trace of a
collar-growth begins around the gyneecial papilla (fig. 15 : 6; bud, 0°53 mm. high).
The six papillee indicating the stamen-primordia appear simultaneously, and are of
identical size and appearance in all early stages; but the two lateral members are
lower down than the other four. In fact McNas (1872) missed them altogether, as
Ss they would not be seen from above. There is no evidence that the lateral stamens are
5 in any way different from the others or arise earlier; if they represented a normal
rs outer whorl, they should be developed earlier and be always growing ata greater rate

a than the others. They establish normal contact relations, and the appearances seen
are identical with those of six equal primordia as in the general case of Angiosperm
floral development. That is to say, the six rounded primordia extend to just touch
a all round the ellipsoidal axis. The fact that the whorl droops as it were on the two
6 sides is clearly the expression of fact that the floral axis is (1) tangentially extended,
iS and (2) under considerable pressure, pinched as it were in its rounder median portion ;
