not by any means decide the important questions which offer themselves for solution,

* The subject has also been considered fully from the theoretical point of view by BRoaDBENT
(‘ British Medical Journal,’ 1876, pp. 833, 401), this author believing that bilaterality of representation
is always effected by commissures between the bulbo-spinal centres.

it is impossible to tabulate the facts in the definite manner used for the historical
retrospect of the graphic and other methods.
Moreover, since the interpretation of the results is completely dependent upon the
methods of experiment in each case, it will be better to arrange the facts as follows :—
(1.) Excitation experiments on the cortex.
(2.) Excitation experiments combined with division of commissures, ‘.¢., corpus
callosum, &c.
(3.) Excitation experiments combined with the excision of the opposite “motor ”
area.
at(4. ) Excitation experiments combined with hemisection of the spinal cord or bulb.
a5. ) Ablation of one hemisphere.
B(6.) Ablation of the “motor” area of one hemisphere followed by ablation of that
E the opposite side.
a7.) Excitation of the corpus callosum.
(8) Degeneration of fibres after excision of portions of the cortex cerebri.
gWe will now briefly state the more important facts determined by the above
