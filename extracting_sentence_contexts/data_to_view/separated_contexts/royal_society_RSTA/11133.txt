Thus, the index
increases from the infra-red to the line D,, where it becomes very large. On the blue
side of D, the index increases rapidly from very small values, but remains less than
unity even as far as \ = 2260. In view of these facts the investigation of the index of potassium seemed likely to
yield results of similar interest. But, unfortunately, the chemical difficulties proved
so great that, in spite of numerous attempts, it was found impossible to obtain
absolute values with the apparatus employed. At the temperature at which
