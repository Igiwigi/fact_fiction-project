Ginger solution. During one stage of the researches, I found it was necessary
to employ solutions containing ginger. In view of the fact that ordinary decoctions of ginger rhizomes, crushed or whole,
present difficulties in sterilising, I began by using the well-known “ preserved
ginger” obtained in jars from the grocer’s, making up solutions containing from
5 to 20 per cent. of the syrup or the rhizomes. It turns out, however, that this
confection is made from a species of Alpinia,t and not from Zingiber.
