In fact,
the above summary only roughly states the most common interpretation of the observations
and there are many refinements and alternative proposals. In particular, there is an old idea of
Prandtl and others that the drag may be power-law f(Re) ~ Re~? with an exponent p(Re) that tends
slowly to 0 as Re — oo; for example, see [23], Ch XXa for the classical literature and [39,40] for a
modern reincarnation. Despite intense ongoing discussion of the details, the observations support
unequivocally the fact that f(Re) decays much slower than the laminar rate 1/Re as Re — oo. Following the terminology introduced for kinetic energy dissipation [19,20], we may refer to this
sublaminar decay as a ‘weak dissipative anomaly’, in contrast to the strong dissipative anomaly
with a non-vanishing limit that is observed for rough walls. We discuss here further the case of a
finite (but large) range of Re in the Blasius range.
