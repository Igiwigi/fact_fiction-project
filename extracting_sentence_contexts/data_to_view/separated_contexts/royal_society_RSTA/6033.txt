The structure is composed
of two superimposed layers of rigid bars essentially working as quadrilateral linkages, but
equipped with an elastic hinge and with a bar containing a slider (a constraint allowing only
relative transverse displacement between the connected elements [44]) which buckles under
tensile load of vanishing magnitude. The latter structural element provides the key mechanical
feature implemented in the design of a simple structure, which displays a series of remarkable
mechanical features, although characterized by only two degrees of freedom. These are related
to the fact that the two structural layers can behave independently or synergically and involve
a purely geometrical nonlinearity. In particular, the following features are found: (i) the critical
loads for bifurcation depend on the geometry of the structure only through the angle fo, but
are independent of the angle ap and of the hinge stiffness Kj (j=1,2), (ii) the structure can
have multiple stable equilibrium configurations under the same applied loads, which may be
displayed as bistable or tetrastable (as shown in figure 2); (iii) the applied loads can be varied

in such a way that a negative (a positive) slope in the load/displacement curve represents : =
a stable (an unstable) loading path. Most of these features are related to the presence of an : =
element bifurcating in tension.
