careful to state that the ganglionie function is distributed all round what he terms the
* contractile zone,” 7. 6. the crescent-shaped interruption of the margin in which the
lithocyst, together with its gelatinous hood, is situated (see Plate 32). On the other
hand, I have stated it as my opinion that the lithocyst is alone the locomotor centre ;
and notwithstanding the account which Dr. Ee gives of the experiments by which
he sought to localize that centre, I still adhere to this opinion. Dr. Ener's experiments
in this connexion were twofold :—First, that of progressively lessening the amount of
contractile tissue left adhering to an excised segment of Aurelia aurita; and, second,
that of excising the lithocyst without injuring the * contractile zone.” Of these two
methods Dr. E1MER appears to lay most stress upon the first one ; for he merely mentions
the second method in a short footnote towards the end of his paper, and there states
that he only tried it in a few cages. Yet to me it seems that for the object in view the
second method is much more trustworthy than the first. I am well aware of the fact
pointed out by Dr. E1xer, that upon each contraction of a given segment of Aurelia
aurita the two arms of the s0-called * contractile zone ' approximate each other, and
that this gives rise to the appearance of spontaneous action on their part. I think,
however, that this appearance is deceptive, being caused only by the absence of resist-
ance at the interrupted part of the margin to the pressure exerted by the contraction of

has not been thoroughly excluded by experiments conducted on the converse method of
removing the lithocysts from between the arms of the contractile zone, 80 long, it 8cems
