But, in building up the slowly varying vibration by means of
simple trains, the instant at which each start is, to a few periods, immaterial.

ยง 68. SELLMErER concludes from this that the natural vibration will be insignifi-
cant compared with the forced vibration. This mistake arises from the fact that

* Tt will be convenient to get rid of the endings of these trains. This we may do by supposing that a
train, once started, is unending ; and by introducing a train of equal amplitude and opposite phase, whose
beginning is so fixed as to extinguish the former train at the right moment.
