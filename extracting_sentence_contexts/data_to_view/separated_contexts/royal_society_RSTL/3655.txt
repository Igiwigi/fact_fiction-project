A perfect analogy is thus established
between the deportment of the bismuth and that of soft iron under the same circum-
stances ; for it is well known that a similar neutralization occurs in the latter case. If the repulsion depended upon the abstract strength of the poles, without reference
to their quality, the repulsion, when the poles are of opposite names, ought to be
greater than when they are alike; for in the former case the poles are greatly
strengthened by their mutual inductive action, while, in the Jatter case, they are
enfeebled by the same cause. But the fact of the repulsion being dependent on the
quality of the pole, demonstrates that the snbstance is capable of assuming a condi-
tion peculiar to each pole, or in other words, is capable of a dual excitation, The
experiments from which these conclusions are drawn are a manifest corroboration of
those made by M. Reicn with steel magnets. If we suppose the flat surfaces of the two semicylinders which constitute the ends
of the cores to be in contact, and the cores $0 excited that the poles P and P' are of
different qualities, the arrangement, it is evident, forms a trve electro-magnet of the
horseshoe form ; and here the pertinency of a remark made by M.
