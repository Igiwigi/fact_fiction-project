chyme (en.).

growth-lamelle in which the fibres are parallel with one another. Usually the
“echinulation” of Turbenaria is laminate in form, and one can often distinguish that
the lamina is composed of two or three striz, and repeating, in fact, the septal
structure. Fig. 574 is a transverse section through the eenenchyme between adjacent
caleyces ; the trabeculew are met in all possible directions. Fig. 578 is a longitudinal
section through the cenenchyme, showing the irregular slanting growth of the
trabeculse and the consequent irregular occurrence and shape of intertrabecular pores,

The echinulations of successive growth-periods are not necessarily above one
another in position, hence the system of canals is very irregular, analogous, speaking
generally, with the system obtaining in the mural area of Eupsammia. The
cmnosarcal parts descend to very unequal depths within the canalicular system. In
