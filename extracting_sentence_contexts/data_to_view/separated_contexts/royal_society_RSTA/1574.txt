We perform our numerical studies with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm
for stochastic processes developed by Kasdin [45]. Equation (2.1) is integrated over a time long
enough as N + 1 periods. The time step is h = 0.027 /w, and the initial velocity is x(0) = 0 because
the particle is at rest at the bottom of the deformable potential.

(a) Input energy and input energy distribution of the system

Input energy is in fact equivalent to work done by the field. In a noise-driven underdamped
nonlinear oscillator, it mainly depends on the different initial positions taken by the particle
on an entire space period of the RP potential substrate. In figure 2, we show the variation of
the input energy averaged over a trajectory for a feedback strength 6 = 0.08, time delay t = 1.5,
for the temperatures T = 0.001 and T = 0.04, and for the values of r indicated in figure.
