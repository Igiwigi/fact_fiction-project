72. It thus appears that when AF+BG+CH is not =0, the reciprocal of the
scroll

& B, 7,

(H, F, C, B, A—=F, —GYp, 4, r=0
has an equation of the very same form,

(H, F, C, B, A=F, —G'p, q, x=0; - - - - (Rec. 1)
80 that in fact the scroll, tenth $pecies, S(3?), defined as the scroll generated by a line
in involution which passes through two points of a skew cubic, may be reciprocally defined
as the scroll generated by a line iti involution which lies in two osculating planes of a
skew cubic.

73. 1f for (ﬆ, 3, y, 3) we substitute their yalues in terms of (X, Y, Z, W), the fore-
going equation of the reciprocal scroll is obtained as an equation of the fourth order in
the coordinates (X, Y, Z, W), and (in the first instance) of the fifth degree in the coeffi-
cients (A, B, C, F, G, H).” 1t is a remarkable circumstance that the whole equation
contains the constant factor AF+BG+CH, 80 that throwing this out, the reduced
equation will be only of the third degree in the coefficients.

74. The transformation is a very troublesome one, but I will indicate the steps by
