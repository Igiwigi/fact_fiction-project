over the lake deposits to Claverdon in the west and Moreton in the south.

There is ample evidence that the history of Lake Harrison was complex. The advance
of the ice over the Wolston clays was not uninterrupted, and there seem to have been at
least three such advances separated by retreats. Evidence for the first oscillation is pro-
vided by the Wolston sand, whose distribution is shown in figure 8. It was laid down on
an undulating surface of clay which had by no means grown up to lake level over the old
valley near Leicester, nor south of Coventry, but which south of Charnwood Forest was
nearly up to the waterâ€™s surface. By this stage the ice must have advanced at least as far
south as Croft, because of the boulders from there in the Lower Wolston clays, yet the
later Wolston sand (and gravels of the same age around Hinckley), obviously water
deposited, extend back to the Leicester area. This means a glacial retreat, and the very
fact that clay gives place to sand and gravel is further evidence of much increased summer
melting.

This first advance presumably halted some way north of the southern limit of the
Wolston sand (figure 8). Yet an auger traverse on Radford Semele hill (M.R. 351643 and
just south of the edge of figure 9) showed two layers of typical Chalky Boulder Clay
interbedded with stoneless plastic clays (see figure 10). Unless one of these is a very large
raft, which is unlikely, two more ice oscillations are called for, making three in all, though
the second seems to have left no outwash gravel on its retreat.

An anomalous feature which is not easy to explain is that over the area which I have
mapped in detail (figure 9) there is a strong development of Dunsmore gravels which are
interpreted as outwash of the north-eastern glacier on its final retreat, but except in the
