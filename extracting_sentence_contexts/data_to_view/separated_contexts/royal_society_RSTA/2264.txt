Owing, however, to the fact
that the spectral light is concentrated within the limits of a narrow slit at the observer’s
eye, the appearance of the field is marred by streaks and other defects, due partly to

duced by non-homogeneity in the media of the eye itself. Such a system is, in fact,
of the type which one would arrange for the purpose of showing up such defects. Further, while the spectral light is confined to this slit-aperture, the instrument primaries
are not, but completely fill the circular aperture of the observation pupil of the colori-
meter. The fact that the spectral light is, in effect, seen through a different observation
pupil from the other constituents of the colour match has the result that parallax
effects are introduced by the slightest movement of the eye.
