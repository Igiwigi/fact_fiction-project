by another, compared with the larger differences of expansion exhibited in the three
axial directions of any one salt, together with the fact that the change of metal is
accompanied by considerable modifications of these latter relative expansions for two
of the axial directions, a and ec, prevent the coefficients of expansion for any one
direction of the three salts from exhibiting any progression corresponding to that
of the atomic weights of the three metals. These directional perturbations are,
however, mutually compensative, the increase of expansion in one of the two directions
referred to being more or less balanced by the diminution in the other; consequently
the effect of interchange of the metals is clearly exhibited by the solid deformation,
the cubical expansion, the coefficients and increments of which have been shown to
exhibit a well-defined progression following the order of the atomic weights of the
three metals.

Before vroceeding to summarise the interesting analogy between the thermal and
