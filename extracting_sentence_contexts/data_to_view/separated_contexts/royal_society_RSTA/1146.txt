The stress acts in the direction at right angles to the principal stress axis which lies in
the plane concerned. If 6, 6a, ¢3 are the principal stresses then

™% = $ (a, — 53), tT: =} (53 — 9), Tt =3(4 = Ga). The importance of the principal shear stresses lies in the fact that it is found experi-
mentally that the addition of a total hydrostatic pressure to any stress system does not
produce any plastic strain. This depends only on the shear stresses. The addition of
a constant pressure to o,, o, and cy leaves 7, +, and 73 unaffected so that >,

Ta, Ts are
sufficient to define the stress system so far

as plastic distortion is concerned ; and since
