Lastly, the Brittle-stars have altogether discarded the use of their ambu-
lacral feet in favour of the much more efficient organs of locomotion 8upplied by their
muscular rays ; and not only the terminal suckers of these feet, but even the whole of
the feet themselves, have dwindled into useless rudiments.

$ IT. STIMULATION.

1. GENERAL FACTS OF STIMULATION.â€”All the Echinoderms we have observed
respond to all kinds of stimulation, The period of latency varies considerably in
different species, and in different parts of the same animal, In the Holothurians it is
remarkably long, and from the seat of stimulation there very frequently starts a wave
of strong contraction, which passes with extreme slowness throughout the length of
the animal in the form of a deep constrietion. Similar waves frequently ocenr
spontaneously. All the Echinoderms seek to escape from injury.
