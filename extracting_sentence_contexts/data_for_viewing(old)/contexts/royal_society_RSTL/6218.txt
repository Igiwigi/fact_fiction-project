AND COMPOSITION IN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 275

of their boiling-points; but the boiling-points of the primary monamines greatly differ
from those of the isomeric bases of the two previous classes.

Constant relations then between the boiling-points and the formulze of the volatile
organic compounds may be said to have been most positively established by the preÂ«
ceding statements. Their existence cannot be called in question on account of their
not always being manifested exactly in the same manner. Such uniformity would obtain
if in all homologous series the difference in boiling-points corresponding to the difference
of composition C, H, were equally great ; if, as a general rule, on comparing two corre-
8ponding pairs of compounds the same difference in composition were found to involve
the same difference in boiling-point. The fact of these relations obtaining in a less
general and simple manner renders their perception, as also their use in determining
the formulz of chemical compounds, more difficult, but does not set them aside, any
more than the existence of a relation between chemical composition and erystalline
form could be denied, on account of its not always manifesting itself in the simplest
form, or the assistance be doubted, which the study of crystalline form often renders in
establishing the formula of a substance, because compounds of altogether different
atomic constitution may possess the same form, or compounds of analogous constitution,
even containing s0-called isomorphous elements, are observed to crystallize in forms
altogether different.

Relations between boiling-point and composition haye been more especially proved
in organic compounds; very many of them, being volatile at comparatively low tempe-
