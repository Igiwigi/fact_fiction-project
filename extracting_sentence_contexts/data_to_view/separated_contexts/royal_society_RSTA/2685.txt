In particular, we
see that for dm <2 the profile takes the form of a hole while for dm> 2 it develops a peak. However, in contrast to the case dm <2 with real eigenvalues at the fold, the expression in the
case din > 2 misses the small amplitude oscillations in the tail of the profile: in this case the
solutions are no longer exponentially localized and instead asymptote as |x| — 00 to oscillations
with wavenumber / (dm — 2)/d consistent with the pure imaginary spatial eigenvalues that are
now present at the fold. In fact, when dm > 2 exponentially localized states are present only at
discrete values of the parameter a that accumulate on as, [47]. We discuss here in detail the behaviour of the LS branch when dm > 2. The branch near dy,
is shown in red in figure 4b with the complete branch shown in figure 5a, both computed on
a half-domain of length L= 1017.
