— But there is another point of view from which the results given above are important.
y show that no conclusions can be drawn from the length of the path of these
molecular streams as to the average free path of the molecules of the gas or the
- frequency of collisions between them. We know enough of gases to be certain that at
-a pressure of a quarter of an inch of mercury the ordinary laws of gases are in full
; that the average free path of the gaseous molecules is infinitesimal ; and the
number of collisions between them in any finite time inconceivably great, And yet
that pressure we can get phospharescence at a distance of at least two inches.
| Although, therefore, we can no longer regard phosphorescence as 80 exceptional a
omenon as has been generally supposed, we are far from intending to underrate
ts importance as a characteristic phenomenon of electric discharge. But this impor-
1 is due to the fact that it becomes more and more prominent as the degree of
Zxhaust increases, and nob to its specially appertaining to any type of exhaust. And
'Rhis increase of importance is greatly enhanced by the consideration that the other
\Zharacteristics of the discharge, such as positive luminosity and the like, become
ually less and less marked as the degree of exhaust increases, till at length
»Ylmost the sole visible phenomenon of the discharge is the phosphorescence* in the
Zube caused by the streams of molecules which its passage excites. And in one
-Jespect the indications given to us by phosphorescence are more definite than those of
»Sny other of the luminous phenomena, because it always speaks to the existence of a
-Jiegative discharge ; and if it is possible, by the method of shadows or otherwise, to
\Aletermine the direction of the streams of molecules, it tells us with considerable
-Hecuracy the position of the source of that discharge. And this renders it, as we
Shall presently see, of the greatest value in researches which have for their object the
