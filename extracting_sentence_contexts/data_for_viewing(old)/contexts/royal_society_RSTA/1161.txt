]. Introduction

The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is an efficient numerical solver used to simulate various
types of flows and physical phenomena [1]. It gives the space and time evolution of fictive particles
gathered in V different groups fj(x,&;,t) with respect to their propagating speed &;, where i¢€
{0,...,V — 1}, and which are located at point (x,t). By computing statistical moments of fj, one
then recovers macroscopic quantities of interest for computational fluid mechanics (CFD), namely,
density p, momentum pu and total energy pE.

Going into more detail, the evolution of these populations f; is most commonly described
through two steps (propagation and collision) that are combined in the widely used stream-and-
collide algorithm [2]. The complex collision process is usually simplified using the BGK collision
operator, which assumes the relaxation of populations f; towards their local equilibrium f Tina
time t, as originally proposed by Bhatnagar et al. [3]. Despite the great success of the BGK-LBM
in various fields of research, this model is well known to encounter stability issues in the zero-
viscosity limit and/or for non-vanishing Mach numbers [1,2]. To alleviate this problem, numerous
