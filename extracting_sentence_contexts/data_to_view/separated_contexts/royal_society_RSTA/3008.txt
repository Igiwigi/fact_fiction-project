Contexts

By definition, contexts are characterized by non-contextual states. The Postulate 0 allows a more precise characterization of the protocol used above to build an
ID card and define states. As a matter of fact, before being used as a context, this entity must
have primarily played the role of a system, and been systematically tested by other contexts. The
corresponding ID card must fulfil Condition 1. Eventually, the probed entity used as a context
is characterized by its own state, which does neither depend on some other context it would be
embedded in, nor on the system it may possibly contain.
