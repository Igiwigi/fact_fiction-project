It now
appears to me more likely that SO, is the agent concerned in the removal of the CaO.CO. from the
shells than CO, as supposed by THoMSON and BucHANAN. This would account for more CO; in the
bottom water and the presence of CaO.SO, in sea-water in such abundance. Also supported by the
fact that in the South Polar Sea there is excess of SO, as well as in the lower water of the Mediterranean
and Greenland currents. |

July 14, 1875.â€”Sounded in 3125 fathoms. I noticed one or two hyaline Foraminifera. These latter
were affected only in colour by the acid.
