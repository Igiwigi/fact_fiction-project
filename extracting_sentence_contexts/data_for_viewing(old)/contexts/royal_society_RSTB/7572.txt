Endamoebidae Calkins. (4) Family Paramoebidae Poche.

It is not intended to review the literature on the classification of amoebae into families
but to show that, so far, no system of classification has been put forward which is based on
probable phylogenetic relationships of amoebae.

It appears to the writer that the creation of families, based on such characters as the
temporary production of flagella by some amoebae under physiological conditions not
properly understood, their parasitic or free-living nature and the possession of an accessory
body ‘Nebenkérper’ is unsound. It does not bear any relation to the probable evolution
of the organisms included in the order Amoebida. It is very well known that Entamoeba
histolytica and other intestinal amoebae can be grown in culture indefinitely on suitable
bacterial food like most of the free-living non-parasitic forms. The mere fact that some
amoebae become parasitic does not justify the creation of the family Endamoebidae. The
production of temporary flagella under conditions imperfectly understood is equally
unsuitable as a character for the creation of a family. In some amoebae it is neither easy
to produce temporary flagella nor is this character as consistent as was assumed by those
who created the families Dimastigamoebidae or Bistadiidae. The question of the production
of flagella will be discussed in connexion with the amoebae described in this work.
Similarly, the possession of ‘Nebenkérper’ by amoebae has not much significance when
attempts are made to trace the evolutionary history of the order Amoebida.

The genera and species among small free-living, intestinal and parasitic amoebae have
been created by the earlier workers largely on the basis of their nuclear structure and their
mode of nuclear division. A number of memoirs dealing with the nuclear division in
