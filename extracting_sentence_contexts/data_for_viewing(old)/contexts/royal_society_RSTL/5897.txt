Plate XLIX.), stands on the top of a cliff, in which a platform, elevated at 8ome points
pear the town, more than 650 feet above the sea, ends abruptly. The slope of the
Jnclined plane forming the summit of this platform is usually at an angle of three or
-Four degrees, but is occasionally steeper, and is prolonged two or three miles inland.
:2Phe precipice between the town and the sea is in many parts perpendicular, although a
ine drawn from the top to the bottom would rarely exceed 459, and in some parts would
nly amount to 35%. In the face of the cliff are exposed the truncated edges of those
Seven lava-currents which were noticed by the Canon RecuytRo in his *© Storia Natu-
ale dell Etna,” and to which the traveller BrxyDoxz called attention in England, by
ating in one of his © Letters on the two Sicilies,' that REcuPERo had been able by the
Aid of these lavas, * to assign a higher antiquity to Mount Etna than had heretofore
Sbeen ascribed to our planet itself.” Dr. CarLo GEMMELLARO assures me that he has
Serified the accuracy of the Canon's descriptions, especially the fact, that at no less than
Seven different levels there intervene, between successive currents of laya, red layers
either of burnt tuff or of decomposed scoriaceous crusts of lava-currents, which have
en baked and reddened by heat, or as Professor BUNSEN would say, by © fumerolic

Amyself in one vertical section at the Scalazza, a spot of which I shall presently have
more to 8ay. They reminded me precisely of the red clays and tuffs which abound
in the Island of Madeira, where many subacrial lavas have overflowed the surface in
8uccession, and where there have been sufficient intervals of time between 8uccessive
eruptions for the decomposition into clay of the crust of each preexisting lava, or where
* volcanic s8and has been showered down from above or washed over the older lava by
torrents and floods.
We need not, however, seck illustrations of 8uch a phenomenon in distant regions,
