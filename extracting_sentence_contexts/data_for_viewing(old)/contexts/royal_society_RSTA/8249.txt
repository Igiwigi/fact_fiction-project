value of A could be obtained by retaining coefficients in (21). for the first loop as far as
nm = 12, and for the second loop as far as n= 16. The coefficients are required (in
some cases) correct to seven figures ; expressions for ’,. etc., can then be obtained
correctly to five figures, and the resulting estimate of A is correct to two or three
figures.* As Q increases for a given B (or as B increases for a given Q). the coefficients
increase in magnitude, and it becomes necessary to take more terms into account in
order to obtain the same degree of accuracy in evaluating V’, ete. Since A is
found to oscillate with diminishing amplitude as Q increases. a higher degree of
accuracy is required in determining ’, ete., in order to obtain satisfactory approxima-
tion in A.

For this reason the method becomes impracticable when Q and B are large, and the
range of our exploration is accordingly very limited. In fact, as fig. 1 makes clear, our
curves are confined in the main within a range of ReyNotps’ number which is less than
Orr’s figure (177) for the lowest value at which instability can possibly occur. Thus
we could have foretold that Q would be positive throughout the greater part of our
diagrams, and the actual determination of the loops has accordingly thrown little new
light on the question of stability or instability.

Tt is clear that, when R has values such that instability can be contemplated, we must
