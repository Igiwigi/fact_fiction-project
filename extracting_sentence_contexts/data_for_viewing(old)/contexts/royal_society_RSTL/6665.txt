306 DR. CLELAND ON THE RELATIONS

Owex, who considers that the central plate of the ethmoid represents in a coalesced
condition the prefrontals of the fish or reptileÂ®, and plays the part which we allot
to the lateral masses in the neural arch of the vomerine segment. Tt cannot do
80, for these reasons: 1st, that while the lateral masses of the ethmoid are Ccon-
tinuous with the vomer, the central plate is never truly continuous, but only con-
tiguous to the yomer ; 2ndly, that the central plate must, for reasons above stated,
play the part of a centrum ; and 3rdly, that, as Professor Goopsir has shown, Pro-
fessor OweN's view is inconsistent with the relation of the olfactory neryes to the central
plate F.

3. The frontal and the central plate of the ethmoid belong to one segment. The fact
of the central plate of the ethmoid having no early connexion with the yomer, as well as
its tendency to remain distinct eyen after the vomer and it have come in contact, shows
that it is not part of the same centrum as the yomer; therefore, inasmuch as we have
already concluded that it is a centrum, it can form no part of the vomerine segment.
On the other hand, the presphenoidal centrum is complete without it. In these cireum-
stances it becomes apparent that the central plate of the ethmoid is the centrum of a
segment intervening between the yomerine and presphenoidal. This opinion is strength-
ened by our remembering that in the Sheep the central plate of the ethmoid is anchy-
losed to the centrum of the presphenoid before uniting with the lateral masses, and that
in the Hedgehog it appears on the base of the skull for a considerable distance between
the presphenoid and vomer. The frontal forms the neural arch belonging to this cen-
trum, and is in constant connexion with it. But if, as above proved, that margin of the
