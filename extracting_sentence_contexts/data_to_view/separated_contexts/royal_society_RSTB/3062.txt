products of assimilation in the leaf at the time of experiment. It might be tested
by trying whether an aspen leaf which has been emptied of its carbohydrates would
form intumescences in darkness. Some light is thrown on the question by the fact
that intumescences will form on leaves floating on a solution of sugar under
conditions in which they are not produced in leaves floating on water or on Knop's
solution. Under the conditions favourable to the formation of intumescences
assimilation is gradually checked by the lack of salts due to the stoppage of
the transpiration current owing to the damp air. In darkness carbon dioxide
assimilation is stopped at once, so that only pre-existing carbohydrates are
available.
