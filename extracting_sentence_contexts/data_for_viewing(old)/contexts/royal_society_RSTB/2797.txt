distribution of the constituent pigments. They are too much the consequences of
the past which made them to be readily amenable to present influences. The
colouration has become a habit.

These facts are closely analogous to the results of Professor Pounron’s
observations (1903) on the susceptibility of lepidopterous larvee to the colours of
their surroundings. Not only do the caterpillars of such sensitive forms as
Gastropacha quercifolia, Odontoptera bidentata, and Amphidasis betularia reflect as
it were the colouration of their evironment, but, in addition, they exhibit a specially
high degree of susceptibility in their early larval stages, becoming less responsive
in the later period of larval life, and, indeed, in some cases ceasing altogether to
react to change of their environment by sympathetic colour-change.
