These states can be of
any nature: physical, mental, biological. This is the minimal interpretation of the QFT-inspired
approach. From this formal viewpoint, the application of the mathematical formalism of quantum
theory is just a matter of convenience, and in fact it proved to be useful in several applications in
different contexts [18-21]. In our concrete model, the states under consideration are possible strategies of players G1
and G2. The creation and annihilation operators are explored to model the process of how players reflect
upon their strategies.
