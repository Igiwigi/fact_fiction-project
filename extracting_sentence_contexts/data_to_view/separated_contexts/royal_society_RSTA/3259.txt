|| Loe, cit., p. 577. {| A similar explanation possibly applies to the fact that when light, transmitted through a stretched
membrane containing gold in suspension, is polarised in the direction of stretching, the emergent light is
red, but when the incident light is polarised in a perpendicular direction the colour is blue, the gold
clumps being comparable with a wave-length in the direction of stretching, but not in a perpendicular
direction. (Cf. AMBRONN, ‘ Ber. d. math.-phys. Kl. d. k. Siichs, Gesellsch. d. Wissensch.,’ December 7, 1896,
