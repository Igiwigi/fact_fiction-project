The funda-
mental particular solutions, there used, are the same as (17) of § 11 infra; and the
solution of the problem of the vibrations of a solid, with a given boundary, over which
the displacements, or the tractions, have assigned values, is developed on the basis
of an existence-theorem, of the same kind as that assumed in § 21; no application is
made of the results to problems of radiation. ]

7. Suppose that ¢ is a function with the following properties :

(1) Outside a given closed surface 8, ¢ and its first and second differential coetti-
cients, with respect to , y, z, are everywhere finite and continuous ;

(2) vanishes at infinite distances from § ;

* March, 1901.—Mr. Larmor has called my attention to the fact that the work in the paper does not
show that all methods of increasing the capacity, without altering the outer conductor or the aperture,
are accompanied by increased dissipation. For instance, the capacity of the condenser might be increased
by displacing the inner conductor relatively to the outer, without altering its size and shape, or by
replacing part of the dielectric plate by conducting material. In such cases there are some analogies with
other physical problems, which suggest a diminished rate of dissipation.
