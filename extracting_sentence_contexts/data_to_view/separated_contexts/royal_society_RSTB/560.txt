absence of dead vegetable matter. Indeed, if there were such loss during growth
when there was no decay, either in M. BoussinGauut’s experiments or in our own, it
must have been almost exactly balanced by corresponding gain ; an assumption which
is without any proof, but which has nevertheless had its advocates. In fact we conclude, that under the existing conditions of practical agriculture
in temperate climates, the annual loss of combined nitrogen over a given area, by
cropping and otherwise, is by no means so great as has been assumed; that the
restoration required to compensate the loss is therefore correspondingly less; and
further, that the known facts relating to the maintenance or the reduction of the
fertility of soils, do not point to the conclusion that such loss as actually does take
place, is compensated by such restoration. The well-known accumulation of nitrogen which takes place in the surface soil
within a few years, when arable land is laid down to grass, is, it may be admitted, not
conclusively explained. At the same time, there is, to say the least, quite as much
evidence in favour of the assumption of a subsoil, as of an atmospheric, source.
