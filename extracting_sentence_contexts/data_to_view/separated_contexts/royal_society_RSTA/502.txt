For short wavelengths, kink waves are converted into
Alfvén waves owing to the collisions between ions and neutrals. Ohmic dissipation dominates for
long wavelengths. In fact, all the diffusive mechanisms must be considered, and missing any of
the inertial, Hall and ambipolar terms will give incorrect results [114,115]. Zaqarashvili et al. [116]


deduced that there is no cut-off frequency for Alfvén waves, only a damping mechanism owing
to the ion-neutral interaction effects, when one is taking into account both the inertial and Hall
terms (where the inertial term is defined as the time variation of the relative velocity perturbations
perpendicular to the unperturbed magnetic field between ions and neutrals). However, according
to Vranjes & Kono [117], this result might be due to the assumption of neglecting the exchange
of momentum between ions and neutrals.
