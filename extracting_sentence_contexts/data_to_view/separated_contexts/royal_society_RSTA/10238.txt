This consists in inserting in the equations
of motion (23) frictional terms proportional to the velocities, and finally making the
coefficients of these terms vanish. This method has some advantages, especially as
regards the positions of the “singular points” t6 be referred to. The chief problem
of this paper was, in fact, first worked through in this manner; but as the method
seemed rather troublesome to expound as regards some points of detail, it was
abandoned in favour of that explained above.

7. The most important case, and the one here chiefly considered, is that ot a
concentrated vertical force applied to the surface, to which the formule (52) relate. The case of a horizontal force, expressed by the formulze (55), could be treated in an
exactly similar manner.
