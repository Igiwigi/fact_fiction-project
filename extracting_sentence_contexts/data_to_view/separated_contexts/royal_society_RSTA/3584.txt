absence of vibration in the tank, which was founded on rock, and also the freedom of
the water from sediment. Moreover, it is easy to lower the critical velocity by subjecting the water to a
disturbing cause; thus fine matter in suspension in the water will lower the critical
velocity. Tapping the pipe or interposing therein a piece of wire gauze will also act
