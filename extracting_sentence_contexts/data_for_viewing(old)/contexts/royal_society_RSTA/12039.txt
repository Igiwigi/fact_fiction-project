only appeared in two of them, then other catalogues were employed. A catalogue
was prepared for the computation which shows the value given by each authority, as
well as that which was finally adopted.

There are 111 latitude stations in vol. 11; at 94 of these the observations were
taken with one or other of the two astronomical circles by TroucHron and Sms,
or the two zenith sectors by SrRANGE; at five they were taken with one of these
instruments and also with RamspEn’s zenith sector, at five more with RAmsDEN’s
zenith sector only ; in five cases they were taken with the 18-inch vertical circle of one
of the 36-inch or the 24-inch theodolites ; and in two cases, in the Himalayan
Mountains, with the 10-inch vertical sectors of a 14-inch theodolite.

As it is a well known fact that some instruments have a tendency to exhibit more
or less constant differences between latitudes deduced from north stars and those
deduced from south stars, it has been generally a rule to observe as many north as
south stars at each station, In the final reductions, even when this rule has not been
followed, a value of the latitude is always deduced from the north stars and another
from the south stars, and the arithmetical mean of the two is adopted for the
final value.

Astronomical Circle No. 2, and Srrance’s Zenith Sector No. 2, have given results
throughout which do not show constant differences between north and south stars.
The two sister instruments have, however, shown marked constant differences, which
must be here noticed, though it is believed that the errors of each are cancelled in the
means.
