repeated. The results are given in Table XIV., Test 2; and, it must be admitted, are
in surprisingly close agreement both with each other and with Test 1. The adverse
influence is gone. The times of hatching are practically equal for P and Q in both
experiments—less than an hour apart—and so are the percentages hatched. But
the latter show a small difference of 3 or 4 per cent. in favour of the damp tray, whether
this is P or Q, and not only is 3 indistinguishable from 4 in such a measurement, but
it is also the same as the 4 per cent. obtained in Test 1.

On the other hand, the standard error of the differences between the P and Q per-
centages is large ; in Test 2 it works out at 5-6 per cent., and it would be of the same
order in Test 1. No stress can, therefore, be laid on the exact values of differences such
as 3 or 4 per cent., since they are just of the order of probable error. But there is
the further fact that the differences are of the same sign throughout and of the same
order of magnitude (when correction is made for the hypothetical adverse influence
in Test 1), and if this is taken into consideration it does suggest that they are very
probably real.

The mean values of the two humidities were 12-2 and 21-1 mm. respectively, and
in the writer’s opinion it may be safely concluded that when the humidity is raised
from the lower to the upper value the hatch percentage is also raised, and by an amount
which is not far from 4 per cent. 12-2 mm. is a higher humidity than the usual 7 to
10 mm. of these incubators run “ dry.” The reason is that their walls absorbed moisture
during each two days that water was supplied to them and gave it out again in the
two days that followed, with the result that the air did not return to its normal humidity
at once.
