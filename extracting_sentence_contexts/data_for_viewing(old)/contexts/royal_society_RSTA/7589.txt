for optically forbidden transitions (with a quadrupole moment). In these K,,;,, is of course
known (cf. (29)), and for large &, it clearly approximates to

(E,—E,)|kpy. (98)

There is, however, no simple expression for K,. Fundaminsky (1949) has performed a
number of detailed calculations. Amongst the representative cases he investigated are the
1°S-2°S' and the 1?S—2?P transitions of atomic hydrogen for which he found K, to be 0:67
and 0-48 respectively. In general the custom is simply to assume that Kis of order (, — E,)'.
The precise value is fortunately of little moment in (96) owing to the fact that K,,;,.
mately dominates the logarithmic term; but without it (97) yields only the asymptotic
variation, not the absolute magnitude. As can be seen the cross-sections for optically allowed
transitions fall off rather more slowly than those for optically forbidden transitions. Similar
conclusions are valid in the case of ions for which, of course, Coulomb waves may be used.
The range of k, for which Bethe’s formula is applicable extends down to some limit
k,(B) whose value is determined by certain detailed properties of the particular transition
concerned. For optically allowed transitions the second non-zero term of the expansion for
the cross-section has a dependence on &, which is essentially similar to that occurring in (97)
and thus differs from that of the first term. Clearly therefore k,(B) is at least partially con-
trolled by the magnitude of the ratio {M1}, /M]},}; formula (96) may not be grossly inaccurate
even at quite low impact energies if the ratio is large, but it will only be valid at very high
impact energies if the ratio is small. The 3°S—3 ?P and 328-4 ?P transitions of atomic sodium
