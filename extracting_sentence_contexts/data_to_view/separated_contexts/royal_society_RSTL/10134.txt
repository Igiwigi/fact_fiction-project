The metamorphosis of the Tadpole lifts ib far above the highest of the
Marsipobranchii proper, but I feel satisfied that the Anura have only gradually become
metamorphosed ; and I doubt whether all the larve of Pseudis undergo that change,
even now. Yet when once this change is set up, we see a very generalised and
archaic Fish become almost a true Reptile. More than this, one kind—Pipa—secarcely
shows a trace of gills, and all the Anura, during their metamorphosis, develop a
* bladder ” which is, apparently, the radiment of an © Allantois ;” if further research
makes this suppoxition a settled fact, the stride made by these forms, during individual
life, will be seen to be very great indeed,

It is better to call the Hag and Lamprey © Marsipobranchs ” than suctorial fishes;
the adult Lamprey, like the Tadpole, is truly suctorial, but the mouth of the Ammocate
or larval Laumprey, and the mouth of the Hag and Bdellostoma, are not modified into
a circular sucking ring, but it remains as a small hooded opening, fringed with short
barbels, or oral palpi. There is no cartilage whatever in the mouth of the Ammocate
(Plate 19, figs. 4, 5), and in the Myxinoids the only cartilage developed is as a pith to
the barbels (Plate 17, figs. 1-3). All this will be explained in the sequel, but we may
as well start fairly, looking upon the subjects of the present paper as greatly specialised,
but not metamorphised, © Marsipobranchs,” a curious variety of arrested © Sand
Pride,” or Ammocate.
