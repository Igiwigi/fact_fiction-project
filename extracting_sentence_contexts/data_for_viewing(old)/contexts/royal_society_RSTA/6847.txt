from the measurements of temperature on the outside of the mould, half way through it and at the centre
of the ingot only. It will appear that internal temperatures are only required at one time, in order to provide
initial conditions for the work, and that thereafter the time variation of temperature on the outside surface
of the mould alone provides sufficient data for the determination of the internal temperature distribution
and its variation with time.

Radiative heat transfer between two parallel plane surfaces has been considered by

Saunders (1929), Fishenden & Saunders (1932) and others, for general values of the emis-
sivities of the two surfaces. If 7,, 7,, are the emissivities of the surfaces of the ingot and mould
respectively, and a is Stefanâ€™s constant, the net radiative heat flux from ingot to mould is
