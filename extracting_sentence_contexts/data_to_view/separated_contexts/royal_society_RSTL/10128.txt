In order to eliminate any doubt
as to whether the salt solution influenced the result, analogous experiments were made
with fresh tissue. The great drawback to the thorough efficiency of picric acid is that
it wets the tissue with some difficulty and ouly penetrates after zome time. This fact
becomes very apparent when large pieces of tissue are used at any time of difficult
permeability attendant on peculiar histological structure. A saturated s0lution of
picric acid in absolute alcohol to some extenb obviates this difficulty, but it is not
80 8uccessful as a saturated watery solution, although it appears to be a valuable
reagent for ordinary work. With regard to other manipulative details, it is, as mentioned above, important to
cut up the material into 8mall pieces, and also to place it at once upon cutting in the
preservative medium.
