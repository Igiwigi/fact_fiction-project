OF TEMPERATURE UPON THE BEAT OF THE DOG'S HEART. 665

heart is at present doubtful. Consequently, bearing in mind that greater division of
= lysiological duties which characterises the higher animal, we may justifiably doubt,
whether the simple relation of higher temperature (within limits) and quicker pulse
found in the Frog and dependent only on the properties of the heart itself, may not
be entirely absent in the isolated heart of the higher animal, which we know to have
its rate of beat under normal cireumstances controlled by a highly specialised et of
extrinsic nerve centres.

The above considerations, taken in connexion with the fact that *© fever” can
hardly be said to exist in an animal with 80 variable a normal temperature as the
Frog exhibits, made ib very desirable to study directly the influence of temperature
variations upon the pulse-rate of the Mammalian heart.

The experiments hitherto made npon Mammalia do not really solve the question
whether the quicker pulse of the warmer animal is due to a direct or an indirect
action (1.0., one exerted by extrinsic nerve centres) upon the heart. BeERNARD, WALTHER,
Horwarn, and no doubt others have found a slow pulse in artificially cooled animals ;
the same phenomenon has been observed_in hybernating Mammals during their
winter sleep. As regards the effect of heightened temperature upon the pulse-rate,
BrouxTox (6) has showed that when Rabbits are heated the heart beats quicker.
But when a whole animal is warmed or cooled we are not justified in concluding that
