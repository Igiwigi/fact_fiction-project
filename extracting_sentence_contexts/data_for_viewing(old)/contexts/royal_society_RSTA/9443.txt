Q& Owing to the uncertainty of our knowledge as to the precise mechanism of the
combustion of carbon monoxide in explosions, that is to say, as to the extent and
character of the intermediary action of steam, itis perhaps difficult to assign, even
approximately, any numerical relation between the affinities of methane and carbon
monoxide for oxygen in flames. Nevertheless, it may be pointed out, without laying
undue stress on the fact, that when the mixtures, initially containing methane, hydrogen
or carbon monoxide, and oxygen in stochiochemical proportions (7.e., CH,+O,+2H, and
CH,+0,+2CO), were exploded under similar conditions in bomb B, the carbon
monoxide was apparently more effective than hydrogen in pulling away oxygen from
the predominating affinity of the hydrocarbon. From the theoretical standpoint it
