'T'nx timber of oak trees, felled in winter, was formerly very
generally believed to be much superior in quality to that
afforded by similar trees felled in spring; and the same
opinion appears to be till 'rather extensively entertained ;
though the practice of felling in winter has wholly ceased, on
account of the encreased value of the bark. But efforts have
been made, and supposed to have been successful, to obtain
the advantages of both seasons of felling, by taking off the
bark in spring, and suffering the tree to stand till the ensuing
winter. A good many facts, which had come within my own
observation, and information which I received from other
sources, had satisfied me that the durability of the alburnum,
at least, of oak trees is considerably increased by this mode
of management; and I was, consequently, led to make
a few experiments (with the result of which I now take the
liberty to trouble the Royal Society) with the hope of dis-
covering the cause of this supposed superiority in the quality
of the wood of winter-felled trees.

In the spring of 1817, two oak trees, of nearly the same
age, and growing contiguously in the same soil, were selected,
each being somewhat less than a century old. The one was
