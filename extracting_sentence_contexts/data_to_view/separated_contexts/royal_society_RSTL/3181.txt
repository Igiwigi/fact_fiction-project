It appears from the obseryations just made known (par. 127.), that in the
Rabbit all the ova of one impregnation are discharged at ahout the same time. This
is opposed to the opinion of Prgvosr and DuwmasF, that in the Rabbit at least two
days elapse before all the ova destined to be developed have left the ovary. That I
am correct in this particular, is rendered still more probable by the fact, that in the
Fallopian tube, and in the beginning of the uterus, minute ova are generally (though
not in every instance) met with lying very near together}. Having found more than
three hundred ova in the uterus and tube, I may perhaps venture to speak with some
confidence as to their particular localities, which it has uniformly been my practice
to record. A general idea of the situation in which many of the minuter ova have
been observed, may be obtained from the Tables (par. 319.),
