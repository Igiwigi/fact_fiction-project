the point 80 near that sonorous brushes passed, then the current of air age
ceased, and the surface of the water became level,

1441. The discharge by a brush is not to all the particles of air that are near the
electrified conductor from which the brush issues; only those parts where the rami-
fications pass are electrified: the air in the central dark parts between them re-
ceives no charge, and, in fact, at the time of discharge, has its electric and induc-
tive tension considerably lowered. For consider fig. 14. to represent a single positive
brush ;—the induction before the discharge is from the end of the rod outwards, in
diverging lines towards the distant conductors, as the walls of the room, &c., and a
particle at « has polarity of a certain degree of tension, and tends with a certain
force to become charged; but at the moment of discharge, the air in the ramifica-
tions þ and d, acquiring also a positive state, opposes its influence to that of the po-
sitive conductor on a, and the tension of the particle at a is therefore diminished
rather than increased. The charged particles at bþ and d are now inductive bodies,
but their lines of inductive action are still outwards towards the walls of the room ;
the direction of the polarity and the tendency of other particles to charge from these,
being governed by, or in conformity with, these lines of force.
