Modifying the longitudinal


known properties of Ca?+ waves [15]. The contractile
a ee ar wave propagation speeds we measure are in the range
) 10-40 pms ', i.e. similar to the speed of cytosolic cal-
cium fertilization waves [16] and 2-3 orders of
magnitude slower than embryonic heart (approx.
20mms ! [17,18]) or arterial smooth muscle (5-
15mms_!, [19]) calcium waves. The fact that the
circumferential (along the fibre axis) propagation
speed is higher than the longitudinal (perpendicular
to the fibre axis) speed (figure 1f) is consistent with
