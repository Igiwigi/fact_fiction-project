Returning to Plate VIL, it is observed that in extract 10 (the cat) the auricle was
inhibited and the ventricle became feeble and irregular. The latter appeared to have
taken on the independent rhythm characteristic of the ventricular beat, when removed
from the control of the auricles. In extract 2 the auricular inhibition is early and
complete, while the ventricle passes into an even more pronounced stage of irregularity
than that of the cat. It is particularly noticeable that we have here to do with
distinct inhibition, the auricle stopping in diastole, and the ventricles tending to do
the same.

If now we turn back for a moment to the work on the isolated frog and mammalian
hearts, several points of interest present themselves. An easy calculation shows that
the concentration of venom in the two experiments of Plate VII. was below 1/30,000 ;
in fact, it was about 1/10,000 in the dog, and 1/18,000 in the cat. These calculations
omit to make allowance for the fact that at first, at any rate, the venom could not have
been distributed throughout the entire volume of blood. The strength of solution
must therefore have been greater than the calculation shows. Such a concentration
of Cobra venom would, as we have seen, kill a frog-ventricle in a few minutes,
acting on its muscular tissue, and throwing it into systolic spasm. On the
mammalian heart we have observed that the same tendency to pass into systolic
tone is manifested, but that it is largely masked in the early stages of the experi-
ments by the violent excitation of the heart muscle, and possibly also by the action
of the venom on the terminals of the vago-inhibitory mechanism in the heart. Of
this, more later on. We noticed that the isolated mammalian heart took much longer
to be killed than the frog-heart, when the same strengths of venom were used, and
that the marked quickening of the beat, which was so obvious a feature in the latter,
