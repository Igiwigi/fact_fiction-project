We are not able to speak definitely as
to the intensity of the streams in the different directions. Those that proceed strictly
ally are probably the most intense either from the greater density of the streams
or the greater velocity of the particles, for we find that there is a very bright patch in
-Sthe centre. But this may be partly due, as we shall see, to the fact that the patch of
tinfoil has a finite though small area. A more difficult matter to account for is the
[apparently sharp limit which bounds the phosphorescent area on its outer side. Tt is
difficult to imagine that there can be an abrupt limit to the angular extent of these
Â© molecular discharges.
