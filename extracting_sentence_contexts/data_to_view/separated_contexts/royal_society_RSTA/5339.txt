However, our position so far has been to favour a Bayesian methodology,
because it allows one to encode physical constraints in the form of prior
distributions on model parameters. The Bayesian formalism is also naturally
designed for model calibration, selection and probabilistic predictions. The fact is that Bayesian methods for selection and calibration of dynamical
systems on noisy observations are only emerging. In a recent attempt, we
considered a particle filter for parameter and state estimation [104]. To be honest,
there is ample room for progress.
