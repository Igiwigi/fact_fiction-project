A point-pair considered as thus
inscribed in the Absolute is said to be a point-pair circle, or simply a circle; the centre
of inscription and the axis of inscription are termed the centre and the axis, Either of
the two sibiconjugate points may be considered as the centre, but the. selection when
made must be adhered to. It is proper to notice that, given the centre and one point of
the circle, the other point of the circle is determined in a unique manner. In fact the
axis is the harmonic of the centre in respect to the Absolute, and then the other point
is the harmonic of the given point in respect to the centre and axis.

210. As a definition, we say that the two Points of a circle are equidistant from the
centre. Now- imagine two points P, P'; and take the point P” 8uch that P, P” are a
circle having P' for its centre; take in like manner the point P” 8ﬆwch that P', P” are a
circle having P” for its centre; and 80 on: and again in the opposite direction, a point
P* 8uch that P', P\ are a circle having P for its centre; a point P" 8uch that P, P are
a circle having P* for its centre, and 80 on.
