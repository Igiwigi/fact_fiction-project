We think there is no
= doubt that the pair of bundles imbedded in the pericycle, figured in Memoir XIII.,
g Plate 22, fig. 5, are leaf-trace bundles, which are just separating from the stele, â€œad
each of which still retains its own external are of secondary tissue. Exactly parallel
cases are well known in Lyginedendron and have been fully described above. Beyond the fact that the stem bore adventitious roots, we have no information as
to these organs. We regard the body represented in Memoir XIII., Plate 23, fig. 12,
as the base of an adventitious root at its junction with the wood of the stem. It is
very probable that the structure represented in Plate 22, fig. 13, is also connected
with the base of a root.

* Some doubt was expressed in Memoir XIIL., p. 293, as to these elements being really thick-walled
cells.
