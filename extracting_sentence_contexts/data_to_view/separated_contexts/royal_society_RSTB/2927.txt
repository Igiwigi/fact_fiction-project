228 DRS. OLIVER AND SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE OF

hollow gland characteristic of the cupule, with the fully preserved condition which
is more usual on the vegetative organs. The fact that the cupular glands are almost always ee with the head empty is
no doubt to be explained by the effete condition of the cupule at the time it was
preserved, as indicated by the state of all its tissues. Its functional activity must
have been limited to a stage earlier than any which has as yet come under observation,
though in its old age it may still have served as a protective husk. So far as the
glands are concerned, the agreement between the cupule of Lagenostoma Lomaai
and the vegetative organs of Lyginodendron Oldhamium is thus found to be
complete.
