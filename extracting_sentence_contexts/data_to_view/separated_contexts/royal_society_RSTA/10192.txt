It is
viewed by means of a horizontal microscope not shown in the figure. The table D
has next to be adjusted in height and in horizontality until the fibre rolls quite freely
on sliding the table F along its guides. When once these adjustments have been
made they serve for the whole fibreâ€”in fact, until it becomes necessary to renew the
glass capillary tubes on account of their becoming dirty. The small table D is covered
with a glass shade which extends over the tubes A and B and protects them from
dust (see fig. 3). The Zeiss scale is 1 centim. in length.
