Microspores were observed by several authors (see p. 38) and regarded as gametes
or as asexual reproductive cells. It must be pointed out that none of the authors
has actually observed the fusion of microspores or the development of the zygote. According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation in observa-
tions recorded by WENT (1924; see also his letter to GEITLER (GEITLER 1932)). WENT
studied the plankton on a journey across the Atlantic. One day the only diatoms
to be found were two forms of Chaetoceros of which the larger was full of microspores
while the smaller cells were surrounded by flagellated swarmers of similar size to
those within the larger cells.
