6-31G* transition state of C; symmetry for interconversion of r-Ca(1Ag) and d-C4(1A’) but,
surprisingly, lying below the latter. In our preliminary CAS(8,12)/AVTZ geometry searches, a
similar transition state has been found but the IRC revealed discontinuities. Such an unphysical
behaviour is removed using the ORC method.

The ultimate path in the isomerization process consists of converting d-C4(1A’) into the more
stable I-Ca(1 Ag) form. As figure 14b shows, this is the rate-determining step, which occurs via an
L-type transition structure dl-C4(+A’) with a ve-CASDC/CBS barrier height of about 37.2 kJ mol!
relative to d-C4(1A’). This compares with the value 58.6 kJ mol7! predicted by Blanksby et al. A
final remark goes to work by Ngandjong et al. [183] who studied the above cyclization pathway for
singlet C4 at the M06-2X/AVDZ level of theory. The authors suggested a one-step isomerization
process where r-Ca(1Ag) is directly attained from L-Ca(t Ag) via a Cg transition structure similar to
dl-C4(1A’). Clearly, their result differs dramatically from our own MR result. In fact, as noted by
the authors themselves, the use of DFT on electronic structure calculations of carbon clusters can
be notoriously complicated due to their intrinsic multistate character [183].
