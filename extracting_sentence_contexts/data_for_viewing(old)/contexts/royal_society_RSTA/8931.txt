general scattering as the wave proceeds through the earth; (2) at each reflexion
a sudden change of amplitude takes place.* The first factor appears to be much
too difficult to deal with at present. A tentative law of diminution of amplitude
suggests itself, viz., Ste’, where 8 is tlie length of the path. The factor would

then be Se ‘9, The numerical labour of testing this is rather serious, and from
LS

some rough trials I do not think it contains much promise of explaining the
observations.

Accordingly, I pass to the second factor, which is within our powers and which
goes a considerable way to explaining the facts. In so far as it fails it may give a
clue to the proper form of the first factor.

Starting with epicentral distance A, Table III. give the corresponding angle e and
fig. 2 the values of H and V for the first impulse P. For PR, we divide A into
(n+1) parts and obtain the value of e corresponding to A/(n+1). Fig. 2 then gives
the corresponding values of ,A,, H, and V,. Thus the horizontal and vertical
components of motion where PR, meets the surface are (,,A,)" H, and (,A,)" V,.

Table IV. shows the results obtained in this way for different distance A, and
between each column of magnitudes the time interval between the disturbances has
