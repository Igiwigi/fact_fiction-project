“corpuscules ”—-7.e., haustoria—are here younger and less numerous and voluminous
in the cells, the contents of which they have not yet had time to injure, and partly
because the hyphe in the intercellular spaces are not yet so abundant as to obscure
the view. The dimensions of these hyphe vary considerably, not only in different
hosts and species of Uredo, but even in the same disease spot. That the hyphe
contain nuclei has already been stated, and is indeed well known. These nuclei are
small in the more elongated and older hyphee, but in the young terminal segments may
be relatively large, and two, three or four in number. (See figs. 5-8.)

In properly stained specimens they are frequently very conspicuous, as the figures
show, and are oval or spheroidal, and may exhibit a distinction into nucleus and
nucleolus (fig. 9). Ihave been unable to satisfy myself of the existence of definite
chromosomes, but the fact that nuclear division may be accompanied by the well-
known figures (see fig. 25) suggests their existence. Delicate staining with alum
hematoxylin, saffranin, or diamant-fuchsin and licht-griin always bring these nuclei out
sharply, and their regular co-existence in pairs in the terminal clavate segments of
the older hyphze, which are mobilising beneath the epidermis to form spore-layers, is
very striking (fig. 10).

It may be added that the variations in colour produced by the fuchsin-green
method, seen on comparing, e.g., figs. 5-10, are due partly to the developmental
state of the hyphze and nuclei, and partly to the control of the successive stains ;
and the same is true of the difference in the colour brought out in haustoria and
cell-nuclei, &e.—cef. figs. 10-16 for instance.
