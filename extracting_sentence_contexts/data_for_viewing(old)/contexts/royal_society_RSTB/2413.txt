Finally, it will be shown that the potential output of spores, per sporangium, is
commonly larger, and the whole sporangium more broadly seated, in the former than

* The only statements of a general nature on this point that I can recall are by PRANTL, in a footnote
(‘Die Hymenophyllaceen,’ p. 38): “ Diese basipetale Entwickelung ist nicht, wie Mrrrentus glaubt, den
Hymenophyllaceen eigen, sondern findet sich an allen erhabenen Receptaculis anderer Farne,” and again
in the text of ‘ Die Schizeaceen,’ p. 39.

in the latter types. In fact, these characters run substantially parallel to one
another, and form, collectively, a very convincing body of evidence upon which a
natural system of classification may be based. The results acquired from this com-
parison of the sorus and sporangium will be further checked by reference to anatomy
and the details of the gametophyte. It must not be anticipated that all the
characters named will run parallel with strict exactness; all that is contended is
that, allowing a reasonable margin for variation from type, there is a substantial
parallelism of characters drawn from these varied sources.

We shall therefore be prepared to consider the following main divisions of the
Ferns, based upon the characters of the sorus, but supported by collateral lines of
evidence : (1) Those with simultaneous origin of the sporangia in the sorus, which
may be designated Simplices ; (2) those with a regular basipetal succession, which
