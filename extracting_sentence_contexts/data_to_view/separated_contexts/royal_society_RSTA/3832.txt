The same device was used by LaLone & Gupta [20] to characterize the elastic limit of : a
x-cut quartz. However, these high-pulsed power technology techniques suffer from the important : 2
following limitations. In addition to being costly and complex, these experiments are limited to {2

small samples due to the fact that the applied magnetic pressure is inversely proportional to the
square of the electrodeâ€™s width (Laplace effect), and the rise time associated with each device is

fixed and cannot be easily changed. Additionally, due to high-intensity electromagnetic fields, it : &
is not possible to use pressure gauges with the samples being tested because of strong electric Dos
perturbations. Finally, these high-pulsed power experimental methods are rarely employed in : =

For this reason, several authors have explored the possibility of performing ICE with plate- 73
impact testing devices by using heterogeneous or layered material systems which smooth aes
the loading pulse.
