Dana shares the opinion of Prof. AGas81z; and
Acas81z believes that the Favositidz, as well as all other species of which the septa
are not continued vertically, ought to be considered strangers to the class of corals. But the facts on which he grounds his opinion are not as yet sufficiently ascertained
for us to be able to form a critical opinion of their value; and until more ample in-
formation is received, we shall continue to rank the polyps in question according to
the method adopted in our former works.”

Professor L. AGas81z, in his © Contributions to the Natural History of the United States,”
vol. iii. plate 15, figured the animals of Millepora. He places Millepora, Heliopora,
Seriatopora, Pocillopora, the whole of the Tabulate and Rugose Corals, with the Hydroid
Acalephe.
