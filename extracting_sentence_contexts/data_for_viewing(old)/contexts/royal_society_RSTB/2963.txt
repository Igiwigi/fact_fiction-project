lamellar septa. The filamentar cavity is closed by a vesicular chitinous mass in Lucina
borealis, Lucina bengalensis, and Lucina aquicostata, but in Loripes leweoma by
the approximation of the greatly thickened chitin-bands that line the sides of the
filaments. In Lucina borealis, Lucina bengalensis, and Lovipes leucoma the inter-
lamellar extensions of filaments of the same lamella very rarely fuse with one
another at their internal (7.e., interlamellar) edges (fig. 24A, a), but such union is fairly
common in Lucina equicostata, so that here deep interfilamentar junctions are
present as well as the true, chitin-supported interfilamentar junctions which lie just
internal to the filaments proper. In this species the interlamellar septa are fewer,
and the interfilamentar spaces wider than in the other three.

Diplodonta oblonga, although usually placed in the family Lucinide, has the outer
demibranch present. The degree of importance to be attached to this fact has been
discussed by Prtsenrer (68, p. 16), by MÃ©ntcaux (62, p. 237), and by Dau
(15, p. 545), the last recommending the separation of Diplodonta from the Lucinide
to constitute a new family, the Diplodontidee. The lamelle are homorhabdie, and
moderately plicate (fig. 24B) with about fifteen filaments to the plica. The filaments
have interlamellar extensions, rather less well-developed than in Lucina, which fuse
