It may be mentioned that the blue boundary

is always slightly convex in the direction of its migration, while the yellow boundary
is always slightly concave, so that each presents a meniscus with its convexity towards
the cathode. At intervals throughout the experiment observations are taken of the positions of
the blue and yellow boundaries, of the time, of the current, and of the voltage ; also of

* The passage of CrO, and Cr,0; ions into the jelly-tube, where they meet with K or other cations,
does not chemically affect the gelatine. In fact, a transparent orange half-normal bichromate-jelly,
containing 12 per cent. of gelatine, may be prepared, solidified, and remelted, without any precipitation of
the gelatine ; but precipitation occurs on the addition of free mineral acid. VOL. CXCII,â€” A. 2x
