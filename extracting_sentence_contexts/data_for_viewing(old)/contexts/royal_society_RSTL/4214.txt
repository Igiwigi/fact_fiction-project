characteristic of salicylic acid,

Action of Chromic Acid.

Datiscetine was likewise distilled with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid ;
the liquid which came over did not contain oily drops, but had the smell of salicylous
acid, and formed with persalts of iron a purple-coloured solution.

A trace of salicylous acid appeared therefore to have been produced.

It follows therefore, I think, from the experiment already detailed, that datiscine,
like salicine, phloridzine, &c., is a glucoside, and that it approaches nearer to salicine
than any other glucoside, with the exception of populine, yet known. In fact I am
not aware of any glucoside, with the exception of salicine and populine, which, when
treated with nitric acid, yields nitrosalicylic or even nitropicric acid. Phloridzine
and phloretine, for instance, when treated with nitric acid, are stated by different
experimenters to yield only oxalic acid. I repeated the experiment with phloretine,
and obtained much oxalic acid, while the residual liquor yielded not a trace of chlo-
ropicrine when treated with hypochlorite of lime, and consequently contained no
nitropicric acid. Quercitrine, when likewise treated with nitric acid, was also found

to yield, as Ricavp states, only oxalic acid. I had no opportunity of trying escule-
