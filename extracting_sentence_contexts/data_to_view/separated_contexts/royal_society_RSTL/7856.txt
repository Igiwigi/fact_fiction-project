Actual trial with the respective
substances produces these effects. It is to be remarked that there is no marked difference
in the proportions of the respective alkaloids which exist, in one or the other state, in
the cell-contents or in the liquid which moistens the whole. This is in harmony with
the impression, to which all the facts at present known seem to conduce, that all the
cinchona alkaloids are physiologically equivalent. From the nature of the weak compound that quinovin is able to form with the cin-
chona. alkaloids, it is evident that none could exist in the presence of quinic acid.
