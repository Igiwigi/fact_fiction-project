that no great stress can be laid on the difference, though the data suggest that there
is a real increase in the proportion of stomata in the plants grown in water. ‘The fact,
however, that the mean frequency of stomata in the dry-soil plants is more than double
that of the wet-soil plants, whilst the indices are generally higher for the wet-soil plants,
shows that here again the increased frequency is an outcome of the greater crowding
of the stomata in the dry-soil plants through the small size of the epidermal cells, and is
not indicative of any increase in the number of stomata formed.

(c) Stomatal indices in Scilla nutans in various parts of the leaf and in various
conditions —The stomatal indices were determined for the middle, basal and apical
regions of a number of leaves of Scilla nutans grown, respectively, in the dark in moist
air, in the light in moist air, and in the light in dry air, The results are given in the
subjoined table,
