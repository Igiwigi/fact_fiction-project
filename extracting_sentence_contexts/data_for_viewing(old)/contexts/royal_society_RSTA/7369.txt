in the observation of the first arrival and also from the error which arises in determining
the best tangent through this point to the curve on which the multiple refractions lie.
The point on the curve calculated for a constant velocity gradient of 2-5/s, where the
slope is 0:60, lies at a greater range than the cusp of the curve and on its upper limb.
Between this point and the cusp there are five observed points which should not be there
if our interpretation were exact. If, however, at a shallower depth than that equivalent
to this point it was assumed that the velocity gradient started to decrease in value, then
it is possible to produce a calculated curve which would not increase its slope so rapidly
with decreasing distance and which could therefore have the required slope at a shorter
range. The existence of these five points is consequently an indication of a continuous
rather than discontinuous change in velocity gradient. No attempts have been made to
calculate a suitable time-distance curve of this type on account of the arithmetical com-
plexity and also on account of the fact that two extra parameters would be introduced,
the first to provide a law for the rate of change of gradient and a second to provide a point
from which this rate of change should begin.


IN AN AREA OF THE EASTERN ATLANTIC 587

The arrivals for the three stations are shown in figures 6, 7 and 8. Table 8 gives the
observations, the slopes of the lines on which they lie, the residuals, and the intercepts of
the lines on the time axis. As before, these observations have been corrected for variations
in depth and so that they represent the values which would have been obtained if the
hydrophones and charges had been on the sea surface. The best straight lines have been
