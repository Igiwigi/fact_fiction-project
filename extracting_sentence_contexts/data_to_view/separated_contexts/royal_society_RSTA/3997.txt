Some argue that the fact that the Higgs boson was found to have a mass below 135 GeV should : Sg

SUSY also has other attractive features: it provides a route to grand unification of strong,
electromagnetic and weak forces at a scale of about 10'° GeV and an escape from too rapid a
proton decay. In some scenarios, it also generates a candidate particle for dark matter.
