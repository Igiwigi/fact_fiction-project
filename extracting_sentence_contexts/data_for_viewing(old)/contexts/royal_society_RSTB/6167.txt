In marsupials and other primitive mammals with a small lobus anterius the pons
is well developed but lies entirely anterior to the entering trigeminal nerve. There
is, in fact, a wide gap between the pons and corpus trapezoideum through which
the fifth nerve enters, and in which the commencement of the lateral lemniscus is
plainly visible (Sroxes, 1911). The trapezoid body is quite unencumbered by the
pons, and the sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves are attached to its superficial surface.
This condition is also found in the majority of other primitive mammals. One of
the characteristic features of the Primate brain is the caudal extension of the pons
to include the entering trigeminal nerve within its fibres. In the highest Primates
the pons even covers the corpus trapezoideum so that the six, seventh, and eighth
nerves are attached immediately against its caudal border, and their fibres pursue
a horizontal course dorsal to its posterior extension. This fact appears to have been
pointed out for the first time by Hep (1893), who regarded it as characteristic for the
chimpanzee and Man. The Edentates, whose life so closely resembles that of
Echidna, have also a marked retro-trigeminal pontine development.

In the Monotremes the only pons present lies wholly behind the fifth nerve, and
in Echidna it covers the anterior part of the corpus trapezoideum, so that the sixth,
seventh, and eighth nerves are attached immediately against its posterior border,
fig. 3. There can be no doubt, then, that the pons in the Monotremes is
the equivalent of that retro-trigeminal pontine development characteristic of the
highest Primates, and that it is causally related to the great size of the lobus anterius
of the cerebellum. The rostrum represents the aborted rudiment of the pre-
trigeminal pons of all other mammals, and its failure of development is reflected in
