classes, and there can be no question that life in towns is more favourable to the
production of F. than is country life, for both races.

Here, again, it is impossible to explain this result on any theory of heredity, and,
though I am not prepared to give adequate explanation of the cause, it is certain that
some extraneous forces here demonstrate their influence on the variation in the
proportion of the sexes produced by both white and coloured people when living
under different physical conditions.

IT am not by any means the first to draw attention to this remarkable fact, but
statements founded on similar results submitted by others have been severely
questioned or emphatically denied, and I venture to think the evidence I adduce here
is of some value in considering the rights of the dispute.

On the other hand, unlike whites, the coloured F. death-rate is higher for towns
than for provinces, and in the city of Habana this is very marked. It must be
recollected, however, that the proportion of adult F. is greater in towns than in the
country, and indeed the numbers concerned are in such proportion, that were it not for
town life I calculate there would be no excess of deaths of coloured F.

In this relation it is of interest to note that of the 16 cities in the Island containing
8000 or more people, 10 of them are on the sea coast and contain 431,063 inhabitants,
