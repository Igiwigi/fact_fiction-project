The frequency spectrum
of the wave motion shows clearly that a considerable band of frequencies is present. This
will readily be appreciated when it is remembered that the record shown in figure 3 is
taken at a depth of 200 ft., and that at shallower depths effects of the shorter period waves
will predominate. This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record which is
used to estimate the correction for tilting of the swinging plane of the main pendulums
shows marked oscillations, indicating that the natural period of the gimbal system (approxi-
mately 2-3 sec.) is being excited. When computing the second-order corrections, a factor is
introduced to allow for the effect of resonance of both the gimbal system and long-period
pendulums. This factor is almost independent of frequency for a considerable band in the
region of 8 to 9 sec., but if wave periods widely different from this value are present the
magnification factor estimated from the ‘mean wave period’ will certainly be too small.
