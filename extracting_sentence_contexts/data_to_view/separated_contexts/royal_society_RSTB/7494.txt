Evidently one or other of the assumptions (i) to (iii) must be wrong, i.e. in a correct
theory one of them would not apply. In the morphogen theory already described these
three assumptions do all apply, and it must therefore be regarded as defective to some
extent. The theory may be corrected by taking into account the fact that the morphogens
do not always have an equal number of left- and right-handed molecules. According to
oneâ€™s point of view one may regard this as invalidating either (i), (ii) or even (iii). Simplest
perhaps is to say that the totality of zygotes just is not F-symmetrical, and that this could be
seen if one looked at the molecules.
