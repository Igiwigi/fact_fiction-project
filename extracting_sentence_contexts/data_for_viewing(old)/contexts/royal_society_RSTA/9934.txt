For Cs, using L.’s for P (1), K.R.’s for P (2.3), and S.’s for S (3.4.5), gives 5N, = 369,
5N, = 1286, p, = 1°458065, a, = —092888, p, = 992400, «, = —112079. These
bring all the lines within limits, P better than the ordinary.

It is to be noticed that although N, may be kept-constant by giving permissible
variations to the lines from which the constants are determined, yet there is a tendency
shown to an increase with inereasing atomic weight. In all cases N, increases with
increasing atomic weight, but the calculated values vary so much with the actual
errors of observation, that it is useless to attempt to find any relation between them.
5N, for Na is probably not far from 220; for the others it is larger. The values of
8N, for K, Rb, Cs might be the same, but in view of the smaller value required for
Na, this is not likely. One important fact brought out, however, is the raising the
value of « for 8, so that its ratio to ~—*5 becomes much closer to that for the P series.

If the condition that «/~ should be the same as for P be applied, say about -2, the
values of 6N, come to about 382 for Na and 650 for the others.

In the present state of the observations, it is useless to attempt to arrive at
anything more definite than that a very small proportionate increase of N for the
5 series will satisfy relations (F and G), make better agreement in general for the
lines $(2), and bring the ratio «/(u—‘5) into close agreement with that for P.
