air 80*. That of a bare rock of granite, the same locality, at 2 p.m., was 1205 ; of black
basaltic rock 122%. The temperature of the granite at midnight was 86*5. Both
Bellary and Hydrabad are sitnated under the shade almost of bare granitic masses,
in the midst of plains covered with sheets of the granitic and black r6gur 80ils just
alluded to, whose almost treeless extent during the hot months is shrunk up and in-
tersected by deep and conntless fissures. The climate of the former station is nearly
as dry as that of Egypt. In 1838 only 11-25 inches of rain fell during the year. The
atmosphere is remarkable for transparency and freedom from clouds. The foregoing
views appear to be strengthened by the fact, that the observed mean temperature of
the elevated stations of Ootacamund (7221 feet above the sea's level), Merctra
(4500 feet), and Candy in Ceylon (1680 feet), are lower than their calculated mean
temperatures. The calculated mean of Ootacamund is 61*64, observed mean 55%8;
of Merctra 6899, observed mean 65*58; and of Candy 7858, observed mean 73%3.
Now all these places are surrounded by an irregular snrface of hill and valley,
generally clothed with eternal forest, presenting an extensive radiating and evapo-
rating surface, and shading the drainage of heavy monsoons that lingers in their
swampy hollows. The humidity of the atmosphere at these stations is very great ;
at Mercara, during nearly half the year, its hygrometric condition closely approaches
saturation. Hence, favoured by the alternations of land and sea breezes, even close
to the sea's level, the low temperatures of some places near the equator, viz. Singa-
pore, lat. 1? 15' N., mean temperature 80*7 ; Malacca, lat. 2* 14' N., mean tempe-
