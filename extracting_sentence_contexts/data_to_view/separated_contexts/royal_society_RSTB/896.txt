HARDY ON THE CHARACTER

logical characters of the three cells of Astacus. This fact has already been dise
by one of us in earlier papers,* but we are able to add a further archaic character
the cell to those given there. In the earlier papers, the specific granulation
justly described as rose-reacting, further investigation has revealed the fact that
rose-reacting substance of Daphnia is also amphophile. In other words, even in
specific granulation the wandering cell of Daphnia is archaic, it is a rose-reacti
amphophile granulation. "We may even pursue the search for the cell element of
undifferentiated sporadic mesoblast a stage further back to the wandering cell of
larval Daphnia, while still within the broad pouch of the mother. Then we find an
amceboid cell with no granules, but the whole cell substance reacts with aniline d
giving “a faint but distinct rose-reaction with methylene-blue.”
Since Tadpoles are not available in summer or autumn, we have not as yet

able to pursue the ontogenetical study of the corpuscles of the Frog.
