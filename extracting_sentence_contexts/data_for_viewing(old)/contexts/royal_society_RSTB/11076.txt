are simply never separated [26,35]. An example is abortive,
non-reductive meiosis in Daphnia, where bivalents are started
to be pulled apart in meiosis I, but the division never follows
through. Rather, the half-bivalents move back to the equatorial
plate, and sister chromatids are subsequently pulled apart as in
normal meiosis II [36]. Ploidy is maintained during this process
because one of the two meiotic division is aborted. We will
group these cases under the name ‘central fusion’ for simplicity,
even if, biologically, they do not include a fusion of cells.

Central fusion automixis is a particularly interesting form
of asexual reproduction because it maintains maternal hetero-
zygosity as long as there is no recombination. In fact, if
recombination is fully suppressed, central fusion automixis
is genetically indistinguishable from mitotic asexuality. Cyto-
logical studies have shown that this situation occurs in some
species that have formerly been thought to reproduce by

mitotic asexuality (e.g. [36]). Finally, some species that regu-
larly reproduce by central fusion automixis do so with low to
very low levels of recombination, thus maintaining maternal
heterozygosity to a large degree [29,34,37-39], although
strong selection against recombinants, such as found during
automictic reproduction in the Cape honeybee [40-42],
may also contribute to low observed recombination rates in
