The nine blue curves are measured by the set of
equidistantly separated gauges. The soliton position in time shifts relative to the position at the previous gauge. (b) Comparison

wave. The measured waves are, in fact, bound waves [41]. They include, additionally, higher
order Stokes harmonics. Depending on the steepness of the waves, these harmonics can be of the
order of three and even higher.
