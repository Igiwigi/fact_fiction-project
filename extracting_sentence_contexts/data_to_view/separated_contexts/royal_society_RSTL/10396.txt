In the third year, or the thirteenth of the experiment, there were only 39 in the
sample from plot 18, but 52 in that from plot 3. There was thus a deficiency in the
number of species on the manured plot, compared with the unmanured, in the first
geparation-year of three, in the s8econd of five, and in the third of 13. This, as the
actual number of species in each separation-year shows, does not represent anything

ike a corresponding decline in the actual number of species on the manured plot ; the
Aifference between the number on it and that on the unmanured plot being, in fact,
Yue to a considerable increase in the later years in the number on the res,
oubtless owing to the decreasing intensity of the struggle without any manure. The increase thus regulting was especially among the Miscellanez ; of which there
Frere in the samples from the unmanured produce 24 in the first, 28 in the second,
EX 31 in the third, of the three Separation-years ; whilst in those from plob 18, the
humbers ranged 21, 22, and 21; that is practically showing no change.
