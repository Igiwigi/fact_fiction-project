At the present writing it appears impossible to homologise the nuclei of the
oculomotor nerve of Platypus with those in the classical descriptions (KAPPERS, 1920,
vol. 2, p. 549; Brouwer, 1918; Hunrer, 1923). There is in Ornithorhynchus no
need for a nucleus of convergence, and yet there is a slender medial group of cells
placed rostrally, whose axones may or may not contribute to the nerve trunk. The
fact that the majority of the axones of both the posterior lateral and antero-lateral
components decussate is slightly confusing. The medial dorsal division which lies quite
cephalward may be the autonomic or Edinger-Westphal nucleus, if position and relative
size of cells be a criterion. But what part the longish nucleus, medio-ventral to the
medio-dorsal cell-group, plays in the physiology of the third nerve, the writer cannot
suggest.
