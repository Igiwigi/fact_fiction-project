Thus the average excess of the bleaching from
expired air over that of the laboratory was found to be about 7°9 in the series of obser-
vations detailed at p. 87, and the average excess in the air of naturally ventilated
schools was almost exactly the same. Although, as previously remarked, there are
probably other factors to be taken into account here, the figures given are sufficiently
striking. They make it appear probable that increased frequency of respiration may
be of no avail whatever in making up for the impurity of the air,

The facts just alluded to appear all the more striking when we consider that expired
air contains about 438 volumes per 10,000 of carbonic acid, whereas the highest
carbonic acid found in schools was only 37°8 volumes. It is probable that poisoning
by organic substances given off by the breath and skin has a very great effect in
lowering the general health and predisposing to other diseases. The deaths from
“ debility ” and “convulsions” in infants are perhaps in considerable proportions due
to sub-acute poisoning by these substances.
