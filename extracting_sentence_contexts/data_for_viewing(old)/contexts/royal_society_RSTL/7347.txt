Compared with the group of Foraminifera obtained at the Hunde Islands at similar
depths, those from the Norway coast present considerable differences; and this is mainly
owing to the fact that the specimens given us from the seven Norwegian dredgings were
only the larger and more conspicuous of a probably rich fauna ; but also, partly, because
the coast of Norway (excepting the neighbourhood of North Cape) lies in the © Boreal
Province,” and is far less under the chilling influence of floating ice than the American
coasts to the westward. The dredging from Rolfs Oe was taken within the © Arctic
Province.” 'The mixed sands obtained from the shells and sponges of Messrs. MACANDREW
and Barrerr's dredgings, and examined by ourselves, yielded many representatives of
