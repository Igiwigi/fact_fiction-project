where E’ is the instantaneous modulus, t is the thickness of each layer and Z is the distance of
each layer to the beam mid-plane. The calculated free strains for the two cycles as a function
of the temperature are shown in figure 6a. In both cycles, the calculated effective free strains
are zero before gelation. This is due to the fact the resin is liquid, and consequently, there is
no permanent deformation nor residual stresses in the resin. In the one-hold cycle, during the
180°C hold, linear cure shrinkage of 0.7% is measured for the prepreg. As mentioned before, this
value only represents the cure shrinkage after gelation where the mismatch of free strains coupled
with modulus development results in permanent deformation of the beam. The strain value then
increases to 1.23% during cool-down as a result of additional thermal shrinkage. In the two-hold
cycle, free strain of 0.6% is measured during the first hold of 140°C owing to cure shrinkage. This
value is then reduced to about 0.5% owing to the combined effects of cure shrinkage and thermal
expansion. During the second hold of 180°C, the free strain level does not change much, because
cure is almost stopped. After cool-down, the free strain level increases to 1.03% owing to thermal
shrinkage. This comparison shows that the free strain level in the second cycle is 0.2% lower than
the first cycle.
