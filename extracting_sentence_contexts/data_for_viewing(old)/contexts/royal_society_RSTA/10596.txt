reciprocal they touch asymptotic lines.

The tangents to the asymptotic lines of the original surface are also represented by

90. The generalized normal to a surface at any point is the line joining that point
to the pole of the tangent plane with respect to the quadric of reciprocation. But
as there is practically no additional labour involved in the following discussion when
the auxiliary quadric is arbitrarily selected, we assume it to be
