each component (SE, EmbrCa, YST, CH and TE) as a unit, and

therefore, analysis is not directly comparable to that achieved
in serum studies. In fact, evaluation of differential expression
of miR-371a-3p among individual TGCT subtypes disclosed
other significant differences, most notably a progressive

expression discriminated prepubertal TGCTs from normal testi-
cular tissue with 69% sensitivity and 80% specificity (table 4).
