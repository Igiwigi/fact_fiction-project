Proceeding with their deductive investigations, they would arrive at the law of even
numbers, and applying this critical test to the compounds of acetylene, would arrive at
the following equations :—

20%%=3% + ar",
20%%*=9+ Zur",
20%*=3u + 3ux?,
&*=# + 20x",
2x, =20 + ax* + wy,
20*xx=3ax* + ax?, p
2axxE=u+20z* +an +2,
20yzE=u + af + 2ax* +227,
2 y08*=20 +auy* + as* + 20%,

The Laputian philosophers may be asumed to have had great reliance on their
deductive processes, and would doubtless have said at once that these facts afforded
a solid ground of preference in fayour of their hypothesis »—indeed that the other
hypothesis was relatively untenable. Neyertheless we may believe them to have felt
some satisfaction when, on descending from their floating island to our earth, we showed
them the process by which acetylene was manufactured by BerTneLoT from hydrogen
and carbon, and thus turned their hypothesis into e demonstrated truth. There is, however, a difficulty in the way of the unqualified acceptance of hypothesis
&, of a very real character, namely that it does not, primd facie, appear to be in perfect
concordance with facts. Now the facts to which this remark applies are of two classes :—
(1) The assumed densities of gases which are not in accordance with either of the two
hypotheses « and @, and (2) assumed densities which are not primd facie in accordance
