154 8. N. DAS GUPTA ON STUDIES IN THE GENERA

The manner of distribution of the two strains within one culture remains, however,
obscure. Observations on the nature of the growth from micro-dissected fragments
of single hyphee (see fig. 3) showed that DH, and DH, may develop respectively from
two branches of the same hypha or even from successive portions of one branch.
Hence it appears that in a DH, culture the characters of both strains may simultaneously
exist within an individual hypha.

The tips of hyphx in the advancing region of a DH, culture were found to be of two
types, one thick and one thin as described in earlier pages, and the growths from
them (with the exception of one mixture) were of two kinds, DH, or DHy. An attempt
to correlate these facts was unsuccessful, since DH, developed from few of the hyphal
tips, DH, grew from both kinds of tip and many of both types of hyphal tip dis-
integrated without developing. As explained before, disintegration can be ascribed
neither to the smallness of the tips nor to the absence of a nucleus. The potentialities
of the hyphe which disintegrated are entirely a matter of conjecture, but it is interesting
to note that even if all of them were potential DH, (which is most unlikely, judging
from the morphological resemblance of these tips to those that grew as DH,), the
maximum possible number of tips (2 ++ 16) producing DH, would still have been less
than the number (26) which gave DH.

Although in these micro-dissection experiments the nature of growth of a tip
could be no more correlated with its length than with its morphological character
(see fig. 4), there is evidence that the probability of a particular mycelial fragment
