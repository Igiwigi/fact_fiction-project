pigment has also been found appearing first in the Malpighian layer of the papilla
(Spencer and Sweet, 1899).

Pigment appears concentrated towards the outermost intermediate cells nearest
the sheath, in the earliest stages at which it is present in embryonic feathers, and
in successive days of incubation, wanders towards the apex of each ridge, from there
sending out amoeboid processes along which pigment granules flow, fig. 5, Plate 16.
The word “ flow ” is used since different concentrations of pigment are visible in
different parts of the processes. This tendency of pigment cells to move inwards
from their place of origin, accounts for isolated pigment cells which have been found
on extremely rare occasions in the pulp of duckling and gosling feathers.

The fact that in definitive feathers pigment cells may be incorporated into the
barb as normal cells, also supports the view that in feathers pigment is formed
within the epithelial cells.

(iii) Rhachis

The study of the development of both nestling and definitive feathers confirms
the theory advanced by Davies (1889) and Srrone (1902) that the rhachis is
formed by fusion of barbs. This method of formation of a feather is illustrated in
fig. 56. The first ridges formed give rise to barbs of approximately equal size, and
at this point (i.¢., the future tip of the feather) it is impossible to distinguish the
primordium of the rhachis, fig. 56A. This condition extends for a very short distance,
