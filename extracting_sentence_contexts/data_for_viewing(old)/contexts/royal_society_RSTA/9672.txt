wasted effort to direct attention to the difficulty which seems to be raised by the
conspicuous nature of the 27-day period in quiet days. The rapidity of the decline
in disturbance and the rapidity of its resuscitation after the representative quiet day
are prominent facts. It will hardly, I think, be suggested that there are limited solar
areas—similar to sunspots in dimensions—whose direct presentation to the earth
exerts a soothing or damping influence on magnetic disturbance on the earth, removing
or diminishing disturbances which otherwise would have made their presence felt.

§ 22. A serious difficulty in the way of an exact determination of the period is that
magnetic storms, and magnetically quiet times, are events usually covering a large
number of hours. A magnetic storm is seldom confined to a single day. Successive
magnetic storms do not as a rule present closely similar features, nor are they usually
of closely similar length. There is thus as a rule no such thing as a definite interval
between them. In the majority of cases opinions would differ—often by hours—as to
when a magnetic storm begins, and still more so as to when it ends. The uncertainty
is least about the time of commencement, and that is presumably the reason why
