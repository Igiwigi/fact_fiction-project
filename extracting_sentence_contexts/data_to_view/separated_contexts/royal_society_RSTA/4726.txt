Here E stands for the determinant of the dreibein. An additional Jacobian arises when we change
variables from the gauge-dependent vielbein E/, to the gauge-invariant metric g,,y,

The metric carries the information about the orientation of the dreibein components relative to
one another and about their length, but not about their absolute orientation in space, which is Lo
encoded in the angular part d°2, for example, the Euler angles.

(i) Different gauge groups :F

Fora larger gauge group than SU(2), say SU(N), for the sake of concreteness, the definition (2.5) of PD
the connection coefficients is not unique, as the dreibein E/, does not span the entire colour space. :s
Therefore, we must extend the basis correspondingly, aS

belonging to different subgroups correspond to different spins.

(ii) Limit of vanishing coupling

The perturbative expansion for small coupling e of the theory described by the classically
equivalent Lagrangian (2.12) is around a topological field theory, i.e. three-dimensional Einstein—
Hilbert gravity.
