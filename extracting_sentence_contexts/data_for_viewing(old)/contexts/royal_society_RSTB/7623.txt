migrations have found expression in the decoration of the pipes in very numerous
artistic areas, but they had little effect upon the spread of tobacco smoking in New
Guinea. This in the main appears to have been a case of simple contact diffusion with
the occasional exceptions when the spread was rapid owing to internal movements. In
this connexion it is necessary to consider the distribution of the terms for tobacco and

NATIVE NAMES FOR TOBACCO

I have dealt as fully as is at present possible with the native names for tobacco and

the central main ranges. Most of these peoples are static communities. Among the
other peoples of the mountainous interior to a certain extent the same holds good, but
for these there frequently have been large or small movements which have extended
their local terms for tobacco.
