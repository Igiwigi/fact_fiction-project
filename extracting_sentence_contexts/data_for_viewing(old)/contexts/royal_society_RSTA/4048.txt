are observed in protoplanetary nebula [45], though the argument for this will need further
astronomical data.

The question can be posed as to the role played by other fullerene cations as carriers of
DIBs. C7p has also been detected in the various nebula and thus it is expected that cH is
present in the diffuse interstellar medium. The electronic absorption spectrum of CH was
obtained in a neon matrix in 1993 [46]. However, in contrast to CH spectrum, it is much
richer in vibrational structure and comprises many bands of similar intensity. The origin
band at 7988A is not the most intense and the band system extends over 1500cm7! with
many overlapping vibronic transitions. Assuming that the oscillator strength is comparable to
the transition of Cj), the individual vibrational bands will have oscillator strengths over an
order of magnitude smaller than that of the Cj) 9632.7 band. Such transitions will have
EWs in the mA range and be difficult to detect. In fact the gas-phase electronic spectrum of
Ci) has been determined in the laboratory using C4)-He in the same way as for Cfo, and
the initial astronomical search for these transitions confirms the conclusion the corresponding
DIBs will be weak, if at all detectable [47]. The candidate molecules must be present in
sufficient abundance and/or possess strong oscillator strengths in order to allow astronomical
detection. Satisfying the latter criteria could be the charge transfer transitions of C{)-M species
in which an electron is transferred between the adsorbed atom, M, and the ionized fullerene
cage [3]. Possibilities for the cosmically abundant atom M include Na, Mg, Fe and H. Owing
to the large charge displacement, such transitions will be associated with very large oscillator
strengths [3]. Measurements of such species should be possible in the laboratory using ion traps,
as for Cf.
