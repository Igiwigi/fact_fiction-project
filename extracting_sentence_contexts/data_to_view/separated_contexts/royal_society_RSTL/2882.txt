In some insects, as in the Hive Bee, this may perhaps amount to from fifteen to
twenty degrees, while in others it perhaps scarcely exceeds one or two degrees above
the temperature of the surrounding medium. Besides this, it has been found that
insects haye a power of generating heat when confined in a given space, and that this
power is in proportion to the activity of respiration. I have had numerous proofs of
this fact in my observations on the varying temperature of the hive. My experiments on the hive were conducted in the following manner : a common
straw hive was placed with its entrance hole in the direction of another wooden hive,
which was standing beside it in a bee-honse, which was s0 constructed that the whole
of the back part of the house could be removed or closed at pleasure. The proper
entrance for the bees at the front of the bee-house was directly into the wooden hive,
from the side of which there was a little covered communication with the entrance
hole of the straw hive, to serve as a passage for the hees and a connection between
the wooden and straw hive.
