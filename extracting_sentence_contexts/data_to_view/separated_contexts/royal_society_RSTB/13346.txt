A relatively well-known example of this is

past 10 000 years or so, is also within the scope of diachronic
linguistics, albeit nearing the limits of how far back its

methods can be applied. However, as formulated in (8), the tion Scale, proposed in Eberhard et al. [34]; another example is
Evolutionary Inference Principle suggests there was a time provided by the scale of Polity Complexity made use of in Gil &
in the distant past when no languages had obligatory TAM Shen [29].

°The choice of language-family size as the measure of cultural and
socio-political complexity was originally data-driven. When begin-
ning the cross-linguistic TAM survey, I had no prior expectations

marking, which is a fact about linguistic phylogeny, or the
evolution of language. Crucially, though, as argued in this

paper, the entire trajectory of the development of obligatory with regard to how different languages would pattern. However,
TAM marking, from none in the distant past to some while working my way, one by one, through our library’s grammati-
maybe 10000 years ago to widespread today, is all part of a cal descriptions of the languages of New Guinea, I was struck that

while languages belonging to the large Nuclear Trans New Guinea
family were predominantly obligatory TAM marking, languages
belonging to other smaller families were relatively evenly split

single story, whereby increases in cultural and socio-political
complexity drive increases in grammatical complexity and

the grammaticalization of TAM marking and predication, between obligatory and optional TAM marking—see table 7.
