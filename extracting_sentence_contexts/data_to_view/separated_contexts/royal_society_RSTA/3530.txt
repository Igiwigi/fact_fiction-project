Accepting this contention, we may however get much useful information from the
Fourter’s analysis. For instance, we know that the consequences of surface heating
on underground temperature can be most easily arrived at by an analysis which

Atreats the Fourier terms as independent entities. Also the examination of differences
Nbetween the relative values of ¢ coefficients at different seasons of the year, or in
aifferent years at the same season, is perhaps the most hopeful way of ascertaining
paanity of origin in different phenomena.
