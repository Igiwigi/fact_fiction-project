green and violet.

After about 3 minutes’ exposure to strong light from 805 scale (\ = 4630) I
fatigued the retina for about 80 seconds with violet from 1130 scale (\ = 4010). On
partly closing the slit and racking quickly back I came upon the green at 830 scale
(A = 4550). It was flickering rapidly, alternately surging into the violet and
retreating, but always retreating farther than it advanced until it got back again to
794 scale, During this time I kept back the blue by occasional exposures of a few
seconds to bright light from 805 scale.

* Neutral, that is to say neither green nor violet. The nentral region between red and blue during
green-blindness has quite a different hue. It should be noted that the word is not used to indicate the
colonr known to artista as “neutral tint,” but is rather intended to emphasise the fact that during blue-
blindness the green of the spectrum passes into violet through a colour in which there is uot the
slightest suggestion of blue.

This possibility of postponing the recovery of a colour sensation, when once it has
been thoroughly exhausted, by a comparatively short exposure, enables the observer
to carry out lengthy observations with a minimum of discomfort.

When the recovery of the violet was complete I exhausted the green sensation
with strong light from FE, and then, partly closing the slit, racked rapidly across into
