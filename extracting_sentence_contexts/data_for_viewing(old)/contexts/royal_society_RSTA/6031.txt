Figure 2. (a) Structure of the LMI (4.4) for a two-dimensional version of the RB convection problem in example 3.4 with
A3 = 0 and after symmetry reduction. The basis functions are products of sinusoidal functions with wavenumber k in the
horizontal direction, and either Legendre polynomials or piecewise (PW) cubic basis functions with compact support in the
vertical direction. (6) Chordal decomposition of a block with nonzero wavenumber k for the PW cubic case. (Online version in

4. Computational implementation

Calculating the best upper bound on &* that the background method has to offer requires solving
the minimization problem (3.82) or its improved version (3.21). Usually, these problems are
analytically intractable and must be tackled numerically.

The computational implementation of the background method is complicated by the fact that
the Euler-Lagrange equations for the optimal A and v in (3.82) and for the optimal u in (3.8b) are
nonlinear and, often, admit multiple solutions. Only solutions satisfying the spectral constraint
(3.9) correspond to the saddle point of problem (3.8b) and give the optimal bound on $"; the
others are ‘spurious’ stationary points for which the eigenvalue problem (3.10) has negative
eigenvalues (see figure 2 in [35] for a schematic illustration), and which therefore do not produce
valid bounds.


This issue has historically been addressed using delicate numerical schemes based on
continuation and bifurcation analysis [20,33,34,39,44,62-64]. Recently, two simpler alternatives
have emerged that do not require continuation and have been applied successfully to a
variety of flows. One approach [36,37,42,51,65,80,84,85] discretizes the minimization problem
