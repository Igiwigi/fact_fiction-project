output of the heart would presumably be increased in non-curarised animals,
owing to the high venous pressure, which would probably more thah counter-
balance the diminution of the output which vagus action alone would bring about.
It need hardly be added, that owing to the contraction of the vessels in certain
vascular areas the blood-pressure in the systemic arteries is raised. Considering these
facts, it may be noted, in the first place, that the rise of arterial pressure is not, as in
the ordinary physiological rise of pressure which is produced during muscular exertion,
or as a result of stimulation of sensory nerves, accompanied by augmentor effects on
the heart; that, on the contrary, the rise of pressure in asphyxia is associated with
vagus action, so that we have the apparent anomaly of increased work thrown upon
the heart, while, at the same time, its action is so limited by the vagus as to reduce
its work and tissue waste as far as is compatible with continuance of the circulation.
A sufficiently probable explanation of this is obvious. In asphyxia the system
as a whole is in danger through arrest of the supply of oxygen. This danger
may be diminished by a change in the distribution of the blood, so that these
tissues which are of vital importance to the economy are supplied richly with blood,
while those organs whose function can be temporarily interrupted without harm to
the system, as, for example, the kidney, spleen, and digestive system are rendered
