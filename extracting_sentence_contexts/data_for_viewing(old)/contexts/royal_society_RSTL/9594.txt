* It is of importance to point ont the fact that some of my previously published experiments appear
conelusively to prove that the natural stimulation which is supplied by the marginal ganglia of the
Meduse resembles all the modes of artificial stimulation which are competent to produce artificial rhythm
in one important particular; the intensity of the stimulation which the marginal ganglia supply is 8ghown
by these experiments to be about the same as that which is required to produce artificial rhythm in the
cae of artificial stimulation. In proof of this point I may allude particularly to the observations which are
detailed in V., $ 1 (a), (b), and (c) of my sccond paper.

f As the effects of temperature in modifying the rate of artificial rhythm no doubt avise from the effects
of temperature on modifying the excitability of the contractile tissues, I think it is desirable here again to
mention a fact which was briefly stated in my second paper (p. 691), viz. : that in the excitable tiszues
of the Mednsw, temperature exerts an immense influence, both on the latent period and on the activity

During the whole progress of snch experiments the faradaic stimulation was, of
course, kept of uniform intensity ; 80 that the progressive acceleration is undoubtedly
due to the increase of temperature alone. With each increment of temperature the
