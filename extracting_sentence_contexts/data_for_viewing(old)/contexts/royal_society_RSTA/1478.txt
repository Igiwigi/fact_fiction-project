plane (and the illumination wave) is resolved, the orientation and pitch of the grating can be
calculated. Interestingly, more complex samples or more complicated coherent illumination or
detection schemes such as ptychography, structured illumination or using holographic/phase-
sensitive detection/wavefront sensors [4], provide multiple mutually interfering waves to the
detector plane, which can enable us to ultimately obtain the wanted phase information with
other waves serving as reference waves and therefore equation (1.2) can also be regarded as
the resolution limit for NAjjy > NAget. Yet for imaging modalities that just directly observe the
obtained image one may want to replace NAjj, with min(NA get, NAjny) in equation (1.2) as a
practical limit for the imaging of elastically scattered light. It has been suggested [5] to define
the ‘n-line resolution’ as ‘the minimum spacing between successive elements of an infinite array
of line objects such that the lowest spatial frequency component other than the constant term
appears in the image’. However, I prefer equation (1.2) over this n-line limit for ‘direct inspection’,
as the n-line resolution may obscure the fact that a grating outside this limit may still be resolved
if the object possesses multiple features, some of which provide the wanted reference wave at
least for computational reconstruction, or if a separate reference path from the light-source is
present. One just has to remember that equation (1.2) refers to which information can in principle
be obtained, meaning with the appropriate method, that may require a separate (holographic)
reference beam path from the illumination source.

Abbe’s equations are, in contrast to many other definitions of resolution limits such as the
Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the PSF, the Rayleigh or the Sparrow limit, see also [2],
concerned with a simple question requiring the answer to be ‘yes’ or ‘no’: Can a structure with


periodicity d be observed in its image? Abbe realized that for imaging of elastically scattered light,
