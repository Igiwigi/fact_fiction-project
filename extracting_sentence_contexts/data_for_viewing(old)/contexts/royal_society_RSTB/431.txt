BrissAupt made the most numerous clinical observations on this point. According
to him there exist in the crus cerebri four bundles, whose relations from behind for-
wards may be stated as follows :â€”-

1. A posterior bundle for the transmission of sensory impressions (CHaRcor,
MEYNERT).

2. A middle bundle for the innervation of the muscles of the limbs and trunk.

3. A bundle of small size, which he called the geniculate bundle on account of its
connection with the genu of the internal capsule. This bundle includes motor fibres,
and is distributed to the bulbar nuclei for the movements of the muscles of the face,
the tongue (perhaps the soft palate) ; in fact to all parts of the head and face which
can be acted on voluntarily.

4, An internal bundle which ends in like manner in the bulb, and whose degenera-
tion only seems to be coincident with intellectual derangements.

To these four bundles the four following divisions of the internal capsule
correspond,

1. To the posterior bundle, the posterior third of the hinder limb corresponds (i.e.,
the region of hemianzsthesia, CoaRcot, RAYMOND).

2. To the middle bundle, the anterior two-thirds of the hinder limb.
