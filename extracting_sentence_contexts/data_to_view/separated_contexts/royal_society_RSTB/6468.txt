286 E. J. W. BARRINGTON ON THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF

5—Tue DicestivE ENZYMES

(i) Methods

The interpretation of the ciliary mechanisms to be advanced below implies the
secretion in the diverticulum and other parts of the alimentary canal of digestive
enzymes, and the following results are designed to provide evidence for this. At the
beginning of the investigation it was hoped that it would be possible to compare the
secretory activity of the different regions of the gut, but so far as the present results
are concerned this has not been possible, for the analysis of the method by which the
food and secretions are transported through the gut has shown that material in some
stage of digestion might be expected to occur in all parts of the mid-gut and hind-gut,
so that the mere fact of a given region exhibiting digestive activity need not imply
that the enzyme concerned was actually produced there. Theoretically, this last
difficulty could be overcome by thoroughly cleaning the tissues before grinding them,
but in practice the gut wall is too delicate to admit of this. The considerable activity
of the diverticulum extracts provides, however, good evidence for the production of
all types of digestive enzymes in this region, for it has been shown above that relatively
little material passes into it from the remainder of the alimentary canal.
