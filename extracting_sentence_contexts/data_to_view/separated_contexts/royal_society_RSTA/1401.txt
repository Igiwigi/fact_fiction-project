The fact that C, and therefore Y, has different values on the two barriers indicates that
across any line drawn perpendicular to the barriers and terminated by them, there is a
mean flow of 4 (X, }t) — ¥(X, —). Hf, however, we use the function F(Z) where

I (Z) = exp (=) .f (Z), it is easy to see that |F (X + 47)| = |F (X —}r)| = 1.

3.2. In spite of the fact that f(Z) has been obtained rather arbitrarily, it can be shown
that it is the unique function for the problem under consideration—or rather, any other
function that satisfies the conditions of the problem is of the form exp (IZ + m) f(Z)
where 1 and m are constants. As explained previously, the introduction of the
exponential does not alter the shape of the relative stream lines. 3.21.
