while a third less continuous line is seen to run for a short distance in a y

these processes are of variable form, being peg-like upgrowths, or trabec

The question whether these processes are to be looked upon as sub-archespg
origin, or as the result of a partial sterilization of the archesporium itself, mus
also remain uncertain, in default of developmental data, which are necess;
deciding such a question. I think, however, that comparisons, on the one han

sporangia of Lepidodendron, also, the brown lines represent sterile tissue, whi
the course of development of the spores has become disorganized, and the
