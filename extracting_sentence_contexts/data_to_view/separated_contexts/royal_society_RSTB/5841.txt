Actually the bracts never appeared
when the operations were made early in the plastochron but only when P, was large
or medium at the time of the operation. On the other hand a bract did not always arise
when the operation was made late in the plastochron ; for in two of the experiments of
sub-group 1, P, was large at the time of operation, and yet Ia was a leaf. This fact
is at present difficult to explain, but it must be remembered that the estimations of the
sizes of P, are liable to considerable error. In spite of this difficulty, therefore, it seems probable that an I,a bract arises when the
operation is made late in the plastochron and when the wound is fairly close to the
centre of the presumptive area of I,, as it actually was in two at least of the three experi-
ments in which bracts arose. As an explanation it is suggested that the presumptive
area of I, is then so divided that even the larger part of it is too small to give rise to a
leaf.
