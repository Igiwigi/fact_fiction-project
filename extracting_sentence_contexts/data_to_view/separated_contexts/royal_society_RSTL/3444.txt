most extraordinary manner, following all the contortions of the string of facts (1874.
1956. 1992. 2006. 2063.), and yet never showing a case of the production of a current
by contact alone, i, e, unaccompanied by chemical action.

2015, On the other hand, how simply does the chemical theory of excitement of
the current represent the facts: as far as we can yet follow them they go hand in
hand. Without chemical action, no current ; with the changes of chemical action,
changes of current ; whilst the influence of the strongest cases of contact, as of silyer
and tin (1997.) with each other, pass for nothing in the resnlt. In further con-
firmation, the exciting power does not rise, but fall, by the contact of the bodies pro-
duced, as the chemical actions producing these decay or are exhausted ; the conse-
quent result being well seen in the effect of the investing fluids produced (1918.
1953. 1966.).
