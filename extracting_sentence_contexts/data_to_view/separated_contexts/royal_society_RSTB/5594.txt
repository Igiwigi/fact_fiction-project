The neutral
folds first appear at the posterior end and fuse dorsally to form the neural canal, and
for a very short while this is connected by the neurenteric canal with the archenteron. The connection, however, is rapidly obliterated by the posterior growth of the
notochord. The whole of the growth in length posterior from the blastopore, in fact, seems
wholly to be dependent on the notochord, and it becomes desirable therefore to
see how it is effected. As already described, at the moment of closure of the blastopore
there exist 16 chordal cells, arranged in four rows of four and one cell deep (see
fig. 18, H, J).
