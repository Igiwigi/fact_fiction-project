and in old cultures in liquid media, such as peptone Mayer solution, where not only
the cells are not sufficiently vigorous for the most part but also the aération is
deficient—the chances that two neighbouring cells will unite in spore-formation are
relatively small, and when a union takes place, the neck, composed of the two fused
tubes, will generally be relatively long, for the cells capable of taking part in such a
union are not so likely to be found so near together as in those cases where all
conditions are favourable. At the same time cells which have to provide long tubes
before conjugation can take place, must suffer a considerable loss of energy in the
production of the tubes, and the surrounding conditions must make it very difficult
to replace that loss. In consequence of this one would expect to find many eases in
which the further development of the tubes had ceased after a certain amount of
growth, and also cases in which fusion of the tubes had occurred, but no spore-
formation had taken place on account of exhaustion. The observed facts suggest
this view.

These considerations, then, explain both the increased length of the tubes and also
the decreased spore-formation of cells under the less favourable conditions, that have
been noted. They help to explain, moreover, the irregularities of the cells under
such conditions. It seems in the highest degree probable that there is some kind
of stimulus, chemical or otherwise, which acts on the cells which take part in spore-
formation, both preparatory to and during the course of the growth of the tubes,
Without supposing the existence of a stimulus, it is difficult to account for the
answering development and the direction of the course of any pair of tubes. Under
favourable conditions this stimulus acts between a pair of cells, situated very near to
one another and capable of showing ready response to its action. Such a pair of
