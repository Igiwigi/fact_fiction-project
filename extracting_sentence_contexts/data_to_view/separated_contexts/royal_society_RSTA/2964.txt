On the other hand, numerical simulations
of the mapping procedure (3.5) are very fast, and it is more efficient to perform two-parameter
scans by finding a stable LB solution for each value of the linewidth enhancement factor and
then continuing it in go. It is seen from figure 9 that the latter approach fails to find a stable LB
around ag * 2 (figure 9a) and aq ~ 0.2 (figure 9b), whereas a slower continuation approach based
on direct numerical integration of equations (2.5)-(2.7) indicates that stable LBs exist in these
parameter domains (cf. figure 6). This discrepancy is related to the fact that at large differences
ag — aq it is hardly possible to excite stable LBs from an arbitrary initial condition not only by
using the functional mapping method, but also by solving numerically the NDDE system on the
full round trip time interval.
