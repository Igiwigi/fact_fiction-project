observations which seemed instructive.

In the first place, it only required a few days in these cases to make the yeast and
the bacterium effect their symbiotic union, whereas I had found that in cultures in
ordinary test-tubes it often needed several weeks—three to six—to establish the
union. This was not due to difference of temperature, though temperature, of course,
affects the question, as also do the media.

I found, in fact, that if I prepared pure tube-cultures of the yeast (S. pyriformis),
and then added a few drops of a pure culture of Bacterium vermiforme, the union
of the two was often delayed. Putting aside all cases obviously depending on
differences in the mode of culture of the two samples, it at last became clear that
some of these partial or temporary failures were due to the fact that at the time
I added the bacterium, the yeast had already finished its fermentation of its own
culture-medium-—the primary fermentation was over, and the medium exhausted.
lf the reader chooses so to express it, the medium was yeast-sick !

Now we are justified in inferring from all that is known of such fermentations—

it has been shown that 8. pyriformis induces an alcoholic fermentation—that they
come to an end owing to the inhibitory action, on the yeast-cells, of the products
of fermentation; and that these products, as they accumulate in the fermented
