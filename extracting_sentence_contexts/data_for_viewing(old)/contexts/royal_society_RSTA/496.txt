where a is a parameter dependent upon crack geometry and is approximately equal to /z for
a half-cracked platelet [30]. By taking the parameters yyap = 1Jm-? [42], Enap =125GPa [43]
and oy, = E/30 [30], a* is estimated to be approximately 36nm. This is in agreement with the
dimensions of the HAP crystallites in enamel and favours the concept of the optimization of
the fracture strength of the mineral crystallites and their insensitivity to minor defects. This
has not been validated owing to the lack of experimental techniques enabling the assessment
of the fracture strength of a single HAP crystallite isolated from a biological tissue. However,
Bechtle et al. [16] calculated the fracture strength of a single enamel crystallite to be approximately
2GPa indirectly, by combining the experimental results and analytical solutions for hierarchical
materials. This value is approximately one order of magnitude higher than the strength obtained
from bulk HAP (approx. 100 MPa [44]; see the electronic supplementary material, table S1) and
is of the order of theoretical strength estimation of approximately 4GPa (oy, = E/30). The slightly
lower experimental value compared with the theoretical value may be explained by the fact that
the elastic modulus of a single enamel crystallite is not reported in the literature owing to the lack
of sample preparation and testing technique. Thus, the elastic modulus of an artificial micro-sized
HAP single crystal (125 GPa) assessed by nanoindentation [43] is used in the calculation of the
theoretical strength. Note that indentation approaches quantify material properties under multi-
axial stress state (largely compressive stresses) that can differ from the properties assessed under
uniaxial tension. Considering the existence of the aforementioned imperfections in the enamel
crystallites, the tensile elastic modulus is expected to be lower in reality than the elastic modulus
value given here. This could be the reason for the discrepancy between the estimated theoretical
strength here and the reported fracture strength by Bechtle et al. [16].
