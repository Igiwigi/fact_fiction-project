of the same size (as the upregulated gene group) is shadowed in grey (b and d). p-values from the sampling for genes under
heat (b) and osmotic (d) stress are 0.0014 and 0.26072, respectively.

upregulated genes contain genes from subgroups with various folding energies, including the
group with the most structured initiation region.

InE. coli, a large fraction (53%) of protein-coding genes is organized in operons as polycistronic
mRNAs and is suggested to coordinate the expression of functionally related proteins [48].
Among the genes translationally upregulated under heat stress those residing in operons were
significantly less than the genome-wide operon configuration of E. coli (45% versus 53%,
p=9.36 x 10~Â°). Furthermore, even for the few of them encoded within the same polycistronic
mRNA we did not detect a coordinated expression. This might be not surprising in light of the
fact that translation levels of ORFs within the same polycystronic mRNA largely differ as they
underlie independent initiation [49] and the strength of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence differs
between the ORFs within one operon [50].

Together, this implies that the response to acute heat stress is at least in part shaped by selection
of a subset of genes whose structure up- and downstream of the translation start most likely
undergoes significant melting at higher temperatures. Thus, the initiation regions of these genes
become more accessible upon heat stress, facilitating ribosome binding and, in turn, translation.

Exposure of E. coli to high osmolarity causes rapid loss of water (plasmolysis), turgor pressure and
