of arches arising, each forming the posterior border
of a future ventral nerve-root foramen. The arches
soon become connected dorsally with the members
of their own side, and the foramina are thus com-
pleted. The posterior arch (0.a. 9) continues to

The remaining arches are even lower, and, in fact, lose almost all individuality; that
it is justifiable to regard them as definite primary arches follows from their seg-
mentation as revealed by the nerve-roots to which they are related.

(ii) Discussion—The development and somitic constitution of the metotic region
of the head of the bird has been a centre of much confusion in the literature. Certain
of the earlier workers asserted that as many as three or four somites arose in front
of the one earliest formed in ontogeny. This extreme view is, however, undoubtedly
incorrect, and has been sufficiently criticized by Prarr (1889), whose interpretation
alone need be considered here. She believed “that the first break in the mesoderm
occurs anterior to the first protovertebra,and that two protovertebra (6r, more correctly,
one and a half) are slowly formed anterior to the first mesodermic cleft, in the time
