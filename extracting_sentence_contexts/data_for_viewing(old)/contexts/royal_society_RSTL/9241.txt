the deprivation of adequate nourishment suffered by the ganglia, in consequence of the
escape of nutrient matter from the cut ends of the nutrient tubes. Accordingly, instead
of cutting off the polypite, I tried the effect of momentarily immersing it in hot

water, and found, as I had expected, that the subsequent disturbances of the rhythm
were precisely similar to those which result from removal of the polypite.

Now, to draw any inferences from 8uch meagre facts as the above would be hazardous,
unless we recognize that in 80 doing our inferences are not trustworthy. But, with this
recognition, I think there will be no harm in briefly stating the deductions tg which the
facts, snch as they are, would scem to point.

Physiologists are undecided as to the extent in which many apparently automatic actions
may not really be actions of a reflex nature. Given, for instance, any ganglio-muscular
tisxue which is rhythmically contracting, and how are we to know whether the action

X of the ganglia is truly automatic, or sustained from time to time by stimuli proceeding
a from other parts of the organism ? In most cases experiments cannot be conducted with
S reference to this question, but in the case of the Meduse they may be 80; and it was
with the view of throwing light on this question that the experiments just described
