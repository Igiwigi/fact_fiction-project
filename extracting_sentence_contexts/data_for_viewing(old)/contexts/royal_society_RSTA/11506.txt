formation of a film, the rapidity of the agitation of the water by the stirrer had a
marked effect on the amount of heat transmitted. This fact has been often observed
in experiments on steam boilers, in which the rate of evaporation has been shown
to depend upon the rapidity of the convection of the water in the boiler.

Hence, in order to determine the rate of transmission for the case of the ordinary
heating surfaces of boilers, it would be necessary to first determine the rate of convec-
tion of the water to and from the surface. The difficulty of measuring the convection
in such a case is very great, and seemed an effectual bar to all experiment.

A means, however, of measuring the rate of convection appeared in the case of
water flowing through metal pipes, at fairly high velocities, which could be
determined, and it is to this case that the experiments described are contined.
