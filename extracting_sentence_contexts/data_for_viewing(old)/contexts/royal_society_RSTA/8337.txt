of FS; so that the configuration of F and V is exactly self-dual. It follows then that
every plane of = meets five lines of ¥ 5 which are associated.

Any line / of 8 meets five chords of ¢, ; for on projecting ¢, from | on to a plane, we
get an elliptic quintic curve which has five nodes. The ‘Y-curve corresponding to 1,
which as we have remarked above is a conic, must therefore have five points of inter-
section with F,°. Hence to lines of S correspond conics of 2%, quinque-secant of FS. Any
cubic primal through I,* meets any one of these ‘Y-curves in six points of which five
lie of F,°, only the last one being free. Hence to any cubic primal through F,° corre-
sponds a prime of 8. Thus: The linear system of primals giving the reverse trans-
formation is the complete system of «* cubic primals through a certain quintic surface
F,5, defined as the locus of lines which meet five general planes in [4]. The primals are all
Segre cubics, and ¥.5 is the locus of their nodes. (Any one of the Segre cubics has in fact
10 nodes ; and these lie at the intersections of pairs of any set of five associated planes
on it. One such set of five planes lies on V,°, and the corresponding intersections
therefore lie on F,5.)

It only remains now to show the chief relations between the figures in 8 and , and
in doing this several interesting properties of the second figure come to light. We
begin by a brief discussion of c; and the system of quadrics ®.

Properties of cs and of &.—We have already seen by projection that five chords of
c; meet a general line of 8, and by the same method it appears that only two meet a
secant of c, at points not on c;. Hence the chords of ¢, form a locus of order five M;°
having ¢, as triple line. Since ¢; is elliptic we can identify every point of it by an elliptic
