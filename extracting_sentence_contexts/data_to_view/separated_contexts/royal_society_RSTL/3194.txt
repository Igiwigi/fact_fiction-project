The villi of the chorion are vesicles in which I observed objects having the appear-
ance of yesicles (Plate VIII. fig. 141.). The whole embryo indeed is composed of
vesicles (Plate VIII. figs. 121A. 121B. 122. bb!, and bb?,); and even the primordial germ
itself (Plate VI. fig. 113. bb.) seems to have been the nucleus of the vesicle in the
centre of which it lies.

297. I have now to mention a fact or two regarding the nature and properties of
nuclei, SCHLEIDEN SupPoses the nucleolus to exist before the nucleus, and ScuwanN
believes that he has obseryed the formation of the nucleus to take place around the
nucleolus. Hence the last-mentioned observyer considers that it may be said, © the
formation of the cell [yesicle] is only a repetition around the nucleus, of the same
process through which the nucleus was formed around the nucleolus;” the difference
being only in degree. In connexion with this yiew Scuwanv refers to the fact, that
nuclei often become hollow vesicles.
