grains were very large, in fact, many of them stretched through the whole thickness of -
the walls from the inner to the outer surface of the tube. The existence of crystals
comparable in linear dimensions with the thickness of the wall of the tube might be
expected to make the tube behave as though the material were not isotropic, for in that
case the resistance to a type of distortion which involves principally contraction of the
material in the radial direction might be very different from a distortion which involves
principally contraction in the tangential direction, All results obtained from tubes
which showed increases or decreases in volume during the initial direct extension compar-
able with those obtained during the combined torsion and extension were rejected on the
ground that the material of which they are composed is not isotropic or that it behaves
as an anisotropic material.
