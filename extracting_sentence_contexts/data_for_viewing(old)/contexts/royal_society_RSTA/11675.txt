being shorter. In Hooxe’s joint it is well known that the angular velocity ratio of
the connected shafts is not constant, whereas in OLDHAM’s Coupling it is.

It is interesting to notice that these two facts immediately follow from Law I., the
sum of the four angles of the spherical quadrilateral not being constant.

In spherical mechanisms the relative lengths of the links may be represented by
the magnitude of the angles at the centre of the sphere which they subtend. This
suggests that a spherical movement may be represented and distinguished from -a
plane movement by inserting the value of the angles between the letters O and U,
which represent the motions.* Thus for examples :——

The spherical counterpart of OoOo is BOaoBOaof, expressing the fact that
opposite links are equal to one another.

Of 0070U, the spherical counterpart is BO«O?a0BUB where B > a.

Of oO%ol it is $vOaO*aohwUha. a < 47; and so on for all the other plane
mechanisms previously enumerated, with one exception.

The movement ITT has no spherical counterpart capable of movement, as it will be
a spherical triangle, though there is a spherical counterpart to the movement IITI.

It is interesting to notice that the reason which precluded ‘the existence of the
combination UIII in plane mechanisms, does not hold in the case of its spherical
