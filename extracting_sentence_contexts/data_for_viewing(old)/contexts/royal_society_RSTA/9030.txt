less regularly from the potassium to the cesium salt, through the rubidium salt.
The ammonium salt, shown in figs. 8 and 9, forms crystals of all types of development,
but a great majority are of the intermediate type exhibited in fig. 8. Fig. 9
illustrates a crystal showing faces of ¢ {001} and g {011} very like those of a
potassium salt of the series. In all four salts of the iron group there is a marked
tendency for a larger development of the faces of 7’{201} than in the other groups of
double selenates studied. A similar fact was observed with respect to the ferrous
iron group of double sulphates.
