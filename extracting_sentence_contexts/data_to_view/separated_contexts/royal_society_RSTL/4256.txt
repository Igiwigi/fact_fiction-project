'= The wettest quarter of the year was the last, in which 52:10 inches were measured ;
s the wettest month in 1848 was February, which yielded 30-55 inches, by far the largest
S quantity ever measured in any month in this country ; and the two wettest days
& were the 3rd and 26th of December, when 4:60 and 422 inches respectively, were
read off. At Seathwaite, there have been forty-eight days in last year wherein the quantity
of rain fallen was between half an inch and 1 inch; thirty-two days between 1 and
2 inches ; thirteen days between 2 and 3 inches ; five days between 3 and 4 inches ; and
two days between 4 and 5 inches. In a former paper which I had the honour to lay before the Royal Society, I

as the facts then ascertained would permit. I now proceed to discuss one or two
points which were intentionally passed over in that report. The mountains flanking the Lake District yalleys, generally increase in altitude
