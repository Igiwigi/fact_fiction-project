KN = 28 fitting the measurements to within the scatter in the data. The fact that all the data lie :8
in regime I implies that the data are insufficient to uniquely determine both K (or AH) and N .
except to say that we expect N > 10-> with KN =28 (N < 10-5 would imply that the response
transitions to regime II at the higher values of 6? investigated in [15], but this is not supported
by the measurements). To emphasize this point we include in figure 8a numerical predictions of
the temporal variation of flux J ata temperature T = 1 with N= 1.7 x 10-4 and AH = —12 as well
as N= 1.26 x 10-5 and AH = —10 in figure 8b, such that KN = 28 in both cases but N varies by
nearly an order of magnitude between the two cases. Excellent agreement is observed between
the measurements and numerical predictions in both cases demonstrating the inadequacy of the
data to uniquely determine both the trap density and binding energy from EP measurements that
all lie in regime I.
