Further, the blue colour would be equally visible if the light illuminating
the discrete spheres (or molecules) entered the silver glass from the air side or the
clear glass side ; and this is not the case. It is of interest to notice that while each individual sphere in glass radiates out
light of an intensity proportional to (a’+48”)/M, a surface separating a glass, containing
many of the spheres to a wave-length of light, from a region of the same glass in
which no spheres are present, reflects light with an intensity proportional to «°+ 46’. This is due to the fact that the number of spheres (on the reflecting surface), the
phase of the forced vibrations of which lies at any instant between given limits, is
proportional to \*; so that the intensity of the reflected light is proportional to \*
times the intensity of the light emitted by a single sphere.
