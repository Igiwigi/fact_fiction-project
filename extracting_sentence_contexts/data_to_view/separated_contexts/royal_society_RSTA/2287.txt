The 1S
choice of a reduced vector of probabilities adds another dimension of arbitrariness: although all
reduced representations are linear transformations of the complete one, min L1-distance values
for them may not be related to each other in a simple way. It seems therefore that one could
profitably use several measures to characterize a given system. At the same time, the fact that
only some measures of contextuality naturally extend into measures of non-contextuality may
provide principled guidance in constraining the multitude of possibilities. CNT3 =
