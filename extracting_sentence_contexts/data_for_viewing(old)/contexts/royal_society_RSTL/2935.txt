of 1835. They were continued almost uninterruptedly until the spring of the present
year. TI had long doubted the statements of naturalists that the Hive Bee does not
hybernate, but maintains a very high temperature in its dwelling throughout the
whole winter. This statement is 80 at variance with everything that is known with
regard to the habits of insects in this country, especially those of the same class, the
Humble Bees, that were it really the case it could not fail to be looked upon as quite
anomalous in the economy of British insects. SwammerDan, Reaunur, and Huses
were all of opinion that the Hive Bee does not at all enter into a tate of hybernation,
but continues active during the winter, Hue states expressly*, that 80 far from
bees becoming torpid in winter, the temperature of a populous hive ranges from 86?
to 88? Fan. when the thermometer in the open air is several degrees below freezing.
But these authors have been deceived with regard to the real fact. The Hive Bee
certainly does not become torpid, but if entirely undistarbed it passes into that con-
dition in which its temperature of body and quantity of respiration are very greatly
diminished ;â€”a $tate of deep sleep in the combs, but a sleep which, s0 far from being
continued at a very low atmospheric temperature, then becomes broken, and is only
continued at a moderate temperature. It is true that when the hive is disturbed in
the winter, and it becomes 80 very readily, its temperature is 800n raised to a great
height. There can be no doubt but that this was the case in the observations made
by the authors just noticed. They must necessarily have disturbed the bees when
they introduced the thermometer to take the temperature of the hive, since, as I am
about to prove, there are periods during the winter when the temperature of the hive
is 80 greatly reduced, and the bees are 80 inactive, that the temperature is scarcely
above that of the open atmosphere; and when the temperature of the air is increased
