ry and transiently increased range of contraction. The period of this increased
contractile power corresponds with the increased irritability previously described.
“This increased range has not invariably been evident in tracings of single muscle
eontractions. The stimulus remaining constant, there follows a gradual diminution
in range of contraction, varying in rapidity of development with the strength of
solution employed, but always more rapid than that produced by aldoxime in
solutions of equivalent strength.
Muscle Curve.—The contraction curves of frogs’ gastrocnemii are greatly altered by
aldehyde. There is seen a much nearer approach to the veratrine curve than was
geen in the case of aldoxime. In fact, in the prolonged descent and alteration, or
Sven obliteration of the secondary curves, the action closely resembles that of
‘veratrine. In the ascent and height of the curve the likeness to veratrine is not
found. On the contrary, the height in solutions of medium strength may be increased,
fand the ascent is always at first rendered more abrupt.
a As the action of aldehyde proceeds, and the muscle becomes paralysed, the height
“of the curve decreases and the ascent again becomes more sloping.
< Action in Presence of Blood.—The phenomenon of contracture evoked by aldehyde
3s largely dispelled by the presence of blood. It may be said that blood modifies the

3 The presence of blood entirely banishes the ascent of the base line from the
Gontraction tracings of muscles immersed in weak solutions of aldehyde, such as a
