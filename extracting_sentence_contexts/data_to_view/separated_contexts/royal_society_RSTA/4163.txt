Neither of them
accepts that we can have knowledge of a reality-in-itself by virtue of those cognitive mechanisms
and dispositions Nature has given us as perceptual agents. Both positions build heavily on the
evolutionary and pragmatic virtues. Bohr understood the important distinction between subject
and object, between experience and the content of experience, whereas QBism rightly points to
the fact that in the light of our Darwinian heritage the assignment of probability values is always a
matter of personal information and expectation. A compromise been Copenhagenism and QBism
could be that most of our personal beliefs are about external matters and that evolution has made
it such that our genes do not allow us to see many things too differently. Thus, our experience
in quantum mechanics is a result of information about experimental data.
