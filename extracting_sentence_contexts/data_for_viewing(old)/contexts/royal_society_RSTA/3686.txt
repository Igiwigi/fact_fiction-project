and Paleoproterozoic Sr isotope record has been generated with little or no complementary
trace element data to track detrital contamination or carbonate alteration. Given the scarcity
of Sr isotope data (relative to younger time intervals) and the variability in data quality, the
conservative view would be that additional Sr isotope data is needed to provide compelling
evidence for the onset of extensive continental exposure between 3.0 and 2.5Ga. However, the
traditional interpretation of the Sr isotope record is generally consistent with our modelling
results, which also show an increase in extent of continental exposure at the end of the Archean
(figures 4 and 5).

There is also a Neoproterozoic increase the observed minimum carbonate 87Sr /86Sr ratios [99]
that, in the traditional framework, could be linked to an increase in the extent of continental
exposure. A Neoproterozoic increase in continental exposure is difficult to reconcile with our
freeboard model results. In fact, no model scenarios show a pronounced and sustained shift in
continental exposure in the Neoproterozoic. Accumulation of radiogenic sedimentary Sr isotope
values in the upper crust after extensive continental exposure should provide a ‘buffer’ that
prevents swings to low seawater ®”Sr/*°Sr ratios during times of more limited continental input.
This buffering mechanism should have become established 250 to 500 Myr (several half lives of
the upper continental crust [100]) after extensive continental exposure (in the Late Archean in our


results)—so at first glance this process is an unlikely explanation for the disagreement between the
freeboard model results and the current carbonate Sr isotope curve. However, despite variability
in the carbonate Sr curve through time, one could view the carbonate record as capturing a
progressive increase in ®’Sr/®Sr ratios—an increase driven by increasing radiogenicity of the
upper continental crust. In addition to this protracted increase, ‘radiogenic sedimentary buffering’
