between ceasation of the faradaic 8timulus and the renewal of spontaneity to be short ; because this interval,
according to the new theory, is the expression of the time required for the contractile tissue to recover exhans-
tion sufficiently to enable the ganglionic stimulation—which had become less than minimal in relation to the
Aliminished excitability of the contractile tisxue—to become minimal, I may also ztate that, according to the
new theory, the reason why a contractile wave is reinforeed while passing a lithoeyst is probably the same as
that to which all reflex action is by that theory 8upposed to be due, yiz. the molecular disturbance in an afferent
nerve being of the nature of a vibration, and the continnous somewhat Tess than minimal stimulation supplied
by the ganglion being als of the nature of a vibration, if the wave-rates in these two vibrations are supposed
8ynchronows, when the afferent disturbance reaches the ganglion the amplitude of the ganglionic vibrations
would be somewhat increased, Hence the stimulation, which was proviously being continuously supplied by
the ganglionic vibrations, and which before being augmented by the arrival of the afferent vibrations was
50mewhat less than minimal, wonld now become minimal or 80mewhat more than minimal. And, conversely,
the facts of inhibition are explained by this theory of ganglionie action as due to an interference of vibrations
tho rates of which are not synchronous,


MR. G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZE. 731

Medusz, the slightest want of ganglionic coordination exhibited by any of the specimens.
Moreover, that the ganglionic coordination is in this case wonderfully far adyanced, is
proved by the fact of members of this genus being able to steer themselyes while
following a light, as described in my last paper *.

In the discophorous species of naked-eyed Medusz, however, perfectly coordinated
action is by no means of such inyariable occurrence as it is in Sersia ; for although in
