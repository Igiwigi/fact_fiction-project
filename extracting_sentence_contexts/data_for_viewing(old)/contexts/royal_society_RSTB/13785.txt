they are distributed on all continents and ecosystems except
Antarctica. Rodents are among the most important hosts of
infectious diseases worldwide [27,28], being associated with
more than 80 zoonotic diseases [27]. Major rodent-borne dis-
eases include HPS, haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome,
plague and leptospirosis [29]. Recent studies have shown that
land-use change has a differential effect on rodent commu-
nities, where rodent reservoirs are favoured, generally
increasing their richness or abundance as a result of

anthropogenic disturbance in natural ecosystems and habitat
conversion into agricultural lands [10,30]. This is explained
by the fact that most rodent reservoirs are r-selected species,
ie. earlier sexual maturity and higher reproductive rate
[31,32], which make them highly resilient to disturbances
and able to colonize different anthropogenic settings [10,30].

(b) Data

(i) Geographical distribution of rodents

We based our study on rodent maps produced by the Inter-
national Union for Conservation of Nature [33] that provide
geographical distribution for all vertebrates, describing the
extent of occurrence for each species. Extent of occurrence quan-
