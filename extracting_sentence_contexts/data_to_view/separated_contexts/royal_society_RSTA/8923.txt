If it is fundamentally a tidal effect, resonance with
a free atmospheric period of 12 hours must be assumed, since the lunar diurnal
barometric variation (which can hardly be of other than tidal origin) is of’ much
smaller magnitude. Probably resonance is necessarily involved -also if the cause
is thermal, as the Ke:viy-Marcutes theory supposes. In any case, however, the
12-hour variation is clearly much more fundamental than the 24-hour component,
a fact which has an interesting bearing on the magnetic variations.

If @ is the velocity potential of the atmospheric motion, so that is the velocity

where v is the velocity of sound. At the earth’s surface, taking dp as
(32) 0°3Q,) sin (A +2’) +(0°31Q,?—0°082Q,’) sin {2 (A+¢’) + 154°}
in millimetres of mercury (so that p in the same units is 760), we find that

(33) @ = (Nv/2xp) [0°3 cos (A +#’) + {0'16Q?—0°041Q,?} cos {2 (A+t’)+ 154°} |. DIURNAL VARIATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 45

The numerical value of Nv*/2xp is 1°99 . 10” (N = 86400, v? = 11°0. 10°) or 31°3R,
where R is the radius of the earth.
