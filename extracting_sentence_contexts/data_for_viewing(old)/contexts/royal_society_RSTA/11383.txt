30. The integration of the equation F = 0 is thus made to depend upon the
integration of a simultaneous system involving fewer independent variables, and

upon the subsequent determination of the arbitrary functions in the integral equiva-
lent of the system. A question therefore arises as to how an integral equivalent
can be obtained. At first sight it seems that, as the number of equations (being
five) is equal to the number of unknowns (/, m, 7, ”, 2) to be determined, Hampurcer’s
method* might be applied to our special instance, though not when the number of
independent variables in the original equation is more than three. But, as a matter
of fact, one of the equations of the system is a functional consequence of two others ;

viz., the equation

dm dm dl dn
a P dy dy DT ae
is a functional consequence of
dw dv
= L+ np, ag m+ nq.

It thus follows that there are only four equations independent of. one another
involving the five variables ; consequently HAMBuRGER’s method does not apply. On
the other hand, the inference is that, as the equations are fewer in number by unity
