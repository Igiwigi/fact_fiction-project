Further,
in some instances when a second dose of venom was injected, after complete vaso-motor
paralysis had taken place, the already much reduced respirations speedily failed
altogether and death took place, as, for example, in the fourth Puff Adder experiment. In one experiment (not mentioned hitherto) two small subcutaneous doses of Daboia
venom, which had been mixed for } hour with CaLmerrteâ€™s antivenin, were uot followed
by the usual slowing of the respiration, which would seem to point to a small amount
of Colubrine poison present having been neutralised by the serum. On the other hand
is the fact that in no case of Viperine poisoning was there any evidence of paralysis
of the end-plates of the phrenic nerves. The evidence does not seem to be sufficient
to decide the point either way, and it must be left to further experiments, on the
lines of C. J.
