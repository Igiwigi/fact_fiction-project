subject to initial conditions, boundary conditions and integral constraints. Here x is the state
vector and p denotes one or more parameters. 1 and m are the numbers of states and parameters, :
respectively. Equation (3.1) is written in the generic (nonlinear) state-space form, where the :=

state-derivatives are functions of the states and some parameters. Sy

The main type of steady solution which describes the rotor blade behaviour in the conventional a
forward flight operating envelope is a periodic orbit (limit cycle solutions). Conventionally, aed
helicopter rotor models have a constant rotor speed and are written in the non-autonomous 22
form, in that the independent variable t appears explicitly in the equations. In fact, the blade : Ss
azimuth angle w is a non-dimensional form of the time variable t. Unlike in helicopters, the rotor : s
in forward autorotation has a variable rotational speed. Hence the rotor is not forced to rotate at : s
a fixed frequency and the blade azimuthal angle y would then need to be modelled as a state 23

variable. The rotor in forward autorotation is therefore a self-excited dynamical system.

4. Description of experiment

he experiments were performed in the University of Bristol low-speed open jet wind tunnel
(figure 2a). The wind tunnel is a closed return system with a 1.68m long open working section.
he diameter of the jet is 3 ft 6in (1.1m) and the maximum attainable velocity is about 33 ms.
[he experimental rig (figure 2b) comprises a two bladed teeter rotor of 1m in diameter. The blades
