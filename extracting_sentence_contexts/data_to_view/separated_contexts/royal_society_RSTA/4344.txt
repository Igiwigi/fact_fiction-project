A suflicient length was left between the point of contact of the lower potential
lead and the terminal of the radiating wire, for the wire to acquire a constant
temperature. As pointed out by Dr. J. T. Borromiry, the low thermal conductivity of glass is
a very serious objection to its use as an enclosure in experiments on emissivity, it
being possible for the inner surface to rise to a temperature very appreciably above
that of the water circulation. Owing to this fact, it was not thought advisable to
take any observations with the radiator at much less than 100Â° above the enclosure. At temperatures higher than this a slight error in the estimation of the temperature
of the enclosure would not alter the results,


A PLATINUM SURFACE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. 505

A large number of experiments were made, but only the most typical results have
been recorded here.
