Finally their colour in certain cases differs more or less
Brom that of gold, and enables them to be distinguished from the mass.
§ We have insisted upon the indications furnished by polishing, as they are often
very useful in metallography, by enabling a constituent to be defined. The sunk
lines, which may be the result of a general attack by etching (or attacking the
section with a reagent) are in themselves by no means characteristic of the presence
f a free constituent in the mass. In default of the additional evidence afforded by
polishing, they probably represent lines of minimum compactness, along which the
etching is deeper, or even, according to Commander Hartmann, lines of tension.*

In fact, polishing revealed some cavities which were relatively important in gold
alloyed with bismuth, thallium, or potassium. In this last case, and especially in
the alloy with indium, we observed grey filaments, which were possibly due to the
incorporation of traces of rouge in a network of fissures, although they might also be
attributed to the presence of a cement, and in all cases they deserved attention,

Partial Attack.—It is known that certain alloys of gold, especially those with iron,
