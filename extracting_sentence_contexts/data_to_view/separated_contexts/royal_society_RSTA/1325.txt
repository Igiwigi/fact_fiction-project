It is
clear that the other derivatives required to express the stress-components, for the
assumed law of pressure, could be evaluated by processes similar to those used above. The results would not be of much interest. The fact that the stress at every point would
be determinate is in accordance with the result of § 1.4. It is important to observe that the breadth ¢ of the border must be finite. It would
not be possible to pass to a limit by diminishing ¢ indefinitely.
