* Potash or pearlash is easily decomposed by the combined attractions of charcoal
and iron; but it is not decomposable by charcoal, or, when perfectly dry, by iron
alone. Two combustible bodies seem to be required by their combined affinities for
the effect; thus in the experiment with the gun barrel, iron and hydrogene are con-
cerned, I consider HomBz&G's pyrophorus: as a triple compound of potassjum,
sulphur, and charcoal; and in this ancient process, the potash is probably decomposed
by two affinities. The substance is perfectly imitated by heating together ten parts
of charcoal, two of potassium, and one of sulphur,

When I first shewed the production of potassium to Dr. Wor. LasToN in October
1807, he stated, that this new fact induced him to conceive that the action of pot-
ash upon platina, was owing to the formation of potassjum, and proposed it, as a
matter of research, whether the alkali might not be decomposed by the joint action
of platina and charcoal,

same reasoning will not apply to the dry compounds which
