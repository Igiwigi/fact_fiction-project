Zygopteris primaria (Corra) Corp was one of the first known Zygopteridee, originally
described over a century ago, but our knowledge of it was hitherto confined to the
petiole, and that too was defective. In the present paper the structure of the stem,
leaf-trace and root is described for the first time, from an old specimen in the Cotta
Collection at Berlin, which had been overlooked for many years. At the same time,
the type-specimen has been re-examined and the structure and mode of branching of
the petiolar strand, hitherto obscure, has been elucidated.

In habit, Z. primaria was a large tree-fern; the slender leaf-bearing axis was held
erect by a thick supporting armour of petiole-bases and adventitious roots. The young -
leaves and aphlebiee were clothed in a dense ramentum of scales.

The investigation of the anatomy has revealed facts of a very unexpected nature.
It has been ascertained beyond doubt that Z. primaria had typical Etapteris petioles,
borne upon a stem having the Botrychioxylon type of stele; the leaf-trace sequence and
root-structure were also essentially as in B. paradovum. Had the Berlin specimen been

* [am here leaving out of consideration the epiphytic axis, with a Botrychioxylon-like stele, found among
the roots of ‘‘ Clepsydropsis” australis ; the affinities of this plant being still uncertain (Sannz, 1928,
pp. 25-26, pl. 6, figs. 50, 51).

} Hoxpen suggests that the sporadic occurrence of secondary wood in the stem of this plant may likewise
be a traumatic character, loc. cit., p. 108 ; see also HotpEn (1931).
