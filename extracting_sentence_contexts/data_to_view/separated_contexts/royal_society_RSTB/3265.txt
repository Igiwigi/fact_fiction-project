The plant tissue petrified in these slabs is much less well preserved than are the
plants in the true coal balls, and it may well be the case that in this bed the plants
forming the coal itself may have partially drifted and decomposed before they
accumulated in their present position; but there is no possibility that the slabs of
stone were formed in any other place than in the coal in which they are now lying,
because of the difficulty of conceiving a physical force which could transport, as such,
flat blocks of stone, sometimes 10 feet by 3 feet in size and 6 inches thick, and place
them horizontally in the coal. Hence in these slabs of petrified débris we see evidence that calcareous matter can
be formed in the seam, replacing the coal itself, which evidence acts as a further
support of the in situ view of the origin of the true “ coal balls.”

Dolomite in the Wirral Colliery.—Another interesting and important case, which
appears to be a parallel to the Lower Coal Measure “coal balls,” has been described
from the Middle Coal Measures by SrraHan ( : 01). ORIGIN OF THE CALCAREOUS CONCRETIONS KNOWN AS “COAL BALLS.” 177

At the time his paper was written Srrawan had not recognised the connection
existing between this phenomenon and the “ coal balls” of the Upper Foot Mine; in
fact, he states that the case is “unique in the fact that the place of the coal is taken
by dolomite, and that the change takes place within the distance of a few yards.”*
Unfortunately the seam is now quite worked through, and is lost for ever in the
back workings of the mine, but owing to the kindness of Mr. Puarr, the Manager,
’ who had supplied Mr. Strawan with information, and who volunteered all the
additional help he could give, specimens were obtained.
