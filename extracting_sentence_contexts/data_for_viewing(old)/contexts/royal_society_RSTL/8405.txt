Now it scarcely needs to be shown at any length that reliable results by this complex
and indirect method are perfectly impossible, eyen were not one condition which really
vitiates the whole found to be entirely disregarded.

He was obliged to use mercury because his crucibles absorbed water; but the strong
capillarity of mercury and its high specific gravity could not fail to introduce great
errors in the deduction from its weight in such very limited volumes.

The supposed expansion of the crucible and enlargement of its capacity when heated
was taken by endeayouring to measure the internal diameter of its brim when cold and
when containing the liquid rock, and it is aswmed the expansion affected all parts of
the crucible alike, so that its capacity, in fact, was proportionate to the cube of this one
imperfectly measured dimension. But this cannot be true, from what we know of the
changes of form of pottery in baking, even were all parts of the crucible heated alike.
But what of the contraction of the crucible, in common with all other earthenware, by
heating, which depends not only on the temperature to which it is raised, but on the
time of its exposure to the heat ?

Of this which is certain to have largely affected Biscnopy's
results, we do not find a word of remark.

Biscnory admits the difficulty of this class of experiment, and
he seems in the end to have but little faith in his results, for he
adopts another method snggested to him by Armnars, an Ober-
