Theoretically,


under the assumption that Fj,G are uniformly Lipschitz, one can guarantee accurate solutions
(in a strong sense) up to a finite time with an error bound that depends linearly on the total error
of learning G (see theorem 3 in [20]). Numerically, we will consider a specific type of RNN known
as the LSTM model for the estimation of G, motivated by the robust numerical results on other
closure problems reported in [20]. In fact, using the approximation theory of a two-layer neural
network, the work in [34] shows that there exists an RNN closure model that gives the desired
consistency up to a finite time. To illustrate the approach, we focus on the Lorenz’96 (L-96) model [26] that fits into the
general structure of (2.1). The L-96 model is a 40-dimensional ODE system with state variables
u=(uo,U1,.. ./ Wa)!

st = (Ujp1 — Uj—2)uj-1 —A(Huj + F(t), j=0,...,J-1=39, (2.7)
with a periodic boundary condition, uj = v9, mimicking geophysical waves in the mid-latitude
atmosphere.
