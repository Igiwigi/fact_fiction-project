Considering the general character of the
graph, however, the significance of their presence can hardly be considered as of the
same interest as for the epoch described in the more accurate data of registration. From the data for the epoch 1703-1754 considered purely by themselves it is difficult
to draw any definite conclusions, but, as will be seen later, they afford some confirmatory
evidence which is not without importance to epidemiological theory. It now remains to consider how far the results of this investigation conform to or
are explained by the facts observed in other places. The most important independent
evidence refers to Scotland. Since the year 1855 the Registrar-General for that
country has published the monthly number of deaths from measles for each of the
eight chief towns.
