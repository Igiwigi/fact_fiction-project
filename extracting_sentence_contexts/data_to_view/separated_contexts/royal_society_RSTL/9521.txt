obtained by flotation. Our observations also agree, inasmuch as Zpss observed these
tubes in the glands of young animals : at leas6 he makes no statement to the effect
that they have been found in the glands of adult animals. From the fact of their
complete, or almost entire, absence in the glands of adult Dogs, T regard these mnch-
branched vesicles merely as forming a stage in the growth of the organ, and consider
that in its fully developed state the gland-vesicles form cavities more or less spherical
in shape, which are very rarely, if at all, branched, or, in other words, in com-
munication with one another. The presence of branched vesicles in a gland probably
indicates that the number of vesicles is being increased by the growth into the vesicles
