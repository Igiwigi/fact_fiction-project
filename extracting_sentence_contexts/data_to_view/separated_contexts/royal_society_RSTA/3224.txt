Different analytical solutions for the steady-state crystallization conditions
with a mush have also been obtained in a series of papers [14-18]. Some approximate analytical
solutions [19-22] describing the time-dependent mushy layer evolution processes for various
crystallization conditions should be mentioned as well. An important point in all of these studies
lies in the fact that the heat and mass fluxes at the phase transition boundaries were given in
a standard (conductive) form. However, there exist processes where the heat and mass fluxes
should be chosen in convective form. Such situations take place, for instance, when we are dealing
with the evolution of sea ice in the presence of substantial oceanic flows [23-25].
