Of the three gymnocarpic
species, R. graminifolius can be excluded because of the large size of its nuts. This leaves
R. tenuifolius and R. acetosella L. as possibilities for the Hawks Tor specimens, and although
the latter fall within the size range for R. tenuifolius and are smaller than well-developed
R. acetosella they may belong to either species. Since Mr Lousley is at present working out the British distribution of this group of
species it would be pointless to attempt a statement now beyond the fact that both R. tenui-
Jolius and R. acetosella tend to be absent from the south of this country. In Europe both are absent from the west and are common in the north, but R. fenuifolius
alone reaches the extreme northern latitudes, and R. acetosella is found farther south, in
Italy and the Balkans where the other is not known, as well as extending into the Orient. Fossil records of ‘R. acetosella’ cannot be regarded with certainty as belonging to
R. acetosella L. in the strict sense; these include those from the Clacton-on-Sea inter-Glacial
bed (Warren et al. 19236), the Lea Valley (Ponders End) (Reid 1915) and the Irish late-
Glacial (zone III) at Ballybetagh and Ralaghan, Co.
