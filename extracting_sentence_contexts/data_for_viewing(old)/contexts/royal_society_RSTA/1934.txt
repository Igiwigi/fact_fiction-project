sampling of vortices more easily. There is, however, no interaction between the chains. The length of the chain L is equal to the
large vortex scale 27r /ky = 1.25. (d) PDF of the Okubo—Weiss parameter for the inextensible chain of panels a and c, along with
the PDF for a tracer, as well as that for an extensible chain (Wig = 20) with equilibrium size of 0.04 and maximum length L,
equal to the length / of the inextensible chain. (Online version in colour.)

Returning to the effect of the bending stiffness, we have shown above that in two dimensions
it strongly affects the preferential sampling of vortical regions because chains must coil in
order to enter vortices. We now examine the effect of the bending stiffness in three dimensions.
Figure 7a shows the PDF of Q, for a long inextensible chain (L = 207) with different values of Wig,
corresponding to a highly flexible (Wig = 10!),a moderately flexible (Wig = 107!) and a rod-like
inflexible (Wig = 10-5) chain. The PDF clearly does not vary with Wig, which is an unequivocal
indication that, in three dimensions, the bending stiffness has no effect on preferential sampling.
This fact provides further confirmation of our explanation of preferential sampling of vortical
regions in 3D turbulence. If the main mechanism is the alignment of the chain with the axis of
the tubular structures on which vorticity concentrates, the chain does not need to coil in order
