being immediately produced on completing the circuit, with-
out allowing either wire to touch the mercury,

24. The presence of this highly electro-positive metal there-
fore counteracts the effect of the negative pole, and exalts
that of the positive in a degree proportioned to its quantity,
till at length it completely overcomes, and even reverses the
former effect. As the quantity (in the foregoing experiment)
diminished in the alloy by the oxidating action of the positive
pole, the mercury, as we have seen, by degrees resumed its
original properties. The only effect that may appear obscure,
is the revulsion noticed in the direction of the currents when
the last portion of oxide disappears. It is, in fact, a pretty com-

plicated effect, but capable of easy explanation. The oxida-
tion takes place over the surface of the metal before the last
portions of sodium are removed. This is easily proved.
We have only to break the circuit altogether, and the crust
of oxide will gradually disappear (unless suffered to go too
far), being reduced by the sodium beneath it. Were it then
not for the crust of oxide, the currents, as has been seen,
would be in a positive direction. But the oxide, acting on
