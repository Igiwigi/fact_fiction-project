the origin of the worker castes among Termites. Eleven examples of these forms
were dissected, and they were found to closely resemble the nymphs in most of their
anatomical characters. The chief difference was to be observed in the gonads, which
are larger in size, probably owing to the fact that the worker-like forms are nearer
sexual maturity. Many of the ova are also in a more advanced stage in develop-
ment (vide p. 124). In three females the ovaries were considerably larger than in
any of the winged females which were dissected. The fat-body also exhibited an
extensive development, being only paralleled by the condition of that tissue found
in the winged adults. On one occasion a worker-like female laid seven ova in
captivity, but, unfortunately, they failed to develop, and I am unable to state
whether they were fertilised or not. On account of the condition of the gonads, I
was at first inclined to regard the forms as being neoteinie individuals of a some-
what unusual type. The fact that the soldiers also exhibit a total absence of any
indications of inhibition or degeneration of the gonads, has contributed largely to
my abandoning this belief. Furthermore, the slightly enlarged head, the general
chitinisation of the body, the condition of the eyes, and the very variable occurrence
of curiously shrivelled wing vestiges, all argue in favour of their being worker-like
forms. I consider that they exhibit the first step in the evolution of the worker
caste, a conclusion which, if correct, is in full accordance with the presence of other
primitive features associated with Archotermopsis. At the same time they afford a
