The reaction would therefore be repre-

2Cr O,+4Ba O,=Cr, O,+0;+4BaO. This method has the advantage of giving a considerable loss of oxygen with a small
quantity only of the substance ; and the perfect agreement with one another of nume-
rous experiments made in this way, led me to place in it the greatest confidence. Facts, however, afterwards came to my knowledge, which proved that this action was
not 80 absolutely uniform as had at first appeared ; and although under the circum-
stances, and with the precautions (especially as to. the relative quantities of the sub-

stances) which I have mentioned, the entire agreement of the experiments proves
that the action is that which I have here given, yet this threw a certain doubt upon
it, and it is only in some of my first experiments that I have used this plan of deter-
mining the oxygen uncontrolled by the following. The determinations with platinum were made in a little apparatus of a very 8imple
construction, which, as I shall elsewhere have occasion to mention it, I will call a
bulb apparatus. A is a small flask in which the weighed substance, to-
gether with a small portion of finely-divided platinum
(prepared from platinum black by ignition) or of animal
charcoal, which is equally effective, is placed.
