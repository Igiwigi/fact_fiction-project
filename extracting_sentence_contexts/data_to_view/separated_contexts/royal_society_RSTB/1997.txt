In the six fertilisations made with dissimilar colour varieties, the numbers
were respectively 61 per cent. and 42 per cent. The differences in fertility are there-
fore not nearly so striking as in the case of the Spherechinus colour varieties. In
fact, they almost; fall within the limits of experimental error. As regards actual size,
however, the differences are more marked. Thus, on an average, the dissimilar larvee
were 4Â°9 per cent. smaller in body-length than the similar, an amount much too large
to be due only to experimental error.
