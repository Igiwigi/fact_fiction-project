Hf costulate, occurs in the same Norway dredgings, and in the Red Sea (PULLEN's sound-
Ings), on the beach near Melbourne, at Swan River, on the Australian Coral-reefs, and
Sn the Durham Coast (Brapy), and of a large size (relatively) in the Crag of Suffolk.
E As fig. 20 represents a distomatous, striated, subcylindrical variety of L. sulcata, 80
Aig. 21 is a smaller and smooth distomatous, but amphora-shaped, variety ; the former
may be aid to be, in one sense, a subvariety of L. $riata, and the latter a subvariety
of L. Iavis. In the Norway dredgings it is smaller and rarer than Z. distoms (fig. 20).
Its two extremities are not nearly 80 equal as those of fig. 20, and the shell is not s0
cylindrical; but in the hotter eas it is long and slender (Plate XVIII. fig. 8). We
term it L. distoma-polita. Tn 80me respects it has less departed, than L. distoma has,
from the ordinary smooth flask-like forms, especially those which are somewhat pointed
at the bulbous end, as Lagena apiculata, Reuss (Sitzungs. Akad. Wien, vol. xIvi. p. 1,
figs. 4-8, 10, 11). In fact the subdivision of these yarieties is artificial, and made only
for the sake of convenience.

The distomatous condition of Zagena also obtains in the globular forms (included in
the Olin of D'Ornmaxy), which frequently have the neck-tube lengthened inwards and
