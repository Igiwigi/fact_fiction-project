Their neat dodging manoeuvres are most striking when
the obstacle is moving, such as a man trying to catch them, but it is no less apparent when
the obstacles are stationary, like trees, when a swarm (as observed on 15 June 1948 in the
tamarisk grove already mentioned) breaks up into streams moving along open lanes between
the trees, the streams diverted here and there by trees in the way, but keeping their general
direction. It seems certain that the reaction is a visual one, for it occurs quickly and pre-
cisely and regardless of whether the obstacle is up-wind, across-wind or down-wind. Some
crude trials of this reaction were conducted in Iran utilizing an artificial obstacle which did
not in fact obstruct the path of the flying insects, but merely obtruded itself suddenly into
their visual field. This was a 7 m. square of black cloth spread on the ground when low-
flying migrants were passing. The original intention had been to see whether migrants
could be induced to settle by a strikingly dark and conspicuous object in their path.
