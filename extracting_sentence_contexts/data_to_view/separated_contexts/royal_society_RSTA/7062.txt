Either the viscous
dissipation of the large eddies will become significant relative to the dissipation in the quasi-
equilibrium range, or the distribution of energy in the small wave-numbers will become so
unsuitable that the energy drawn from them by the self-preserving range can no longer be
maintained at the correct amount for a linear decay. Information regarding the end of the
initial period as a function of R,, is not very reliable, and unfortunately the working section
of the Cavendish wind-tunnel is too short to be suitable for this purpose. What facts are
available have been collected by Batchelor & Townsend (19482), and indicate that the
decay time, in terms of x/M, at which the linear decay law breaks down does not vary greatly
with R,,. This supports the view that the end of the period is caused by a crisis in the transfer
of energy from small to large wave-numbers rather than by a relative increase in the direct
viscous dissipation from the large eddies. TABLE OF CONCLUSIONS

For convenience, the various theories of isotropic turbulence, together with notes on their
experimental backing, are tabulated (table 1).
