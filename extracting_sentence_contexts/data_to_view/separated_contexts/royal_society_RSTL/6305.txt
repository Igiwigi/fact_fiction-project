The last
three columns of the Table give the percentage of nitrogen in the Entire Animals due to
all parts together, both Carcass and Offal ; but determined or calculated by three different
methods. Before considering the actual composition of the animals, in regard to nitrogets
as shown in these three concluding columns, it will be interesting to consider the
