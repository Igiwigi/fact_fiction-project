Another point of interest is the tendeney of the veins to enlarge into great irregular
sinuses. The cardinals dilate anteriorly into capacious cardinal sinuses, and the hepatic
veins into an immense hepatic sinus ; the blood from the head is poured partly into
the orbital, partly into the hyoidean sinuses. In fact the majority of the venous
channels, as will be seen by an inspection of figs. 1 and 2, are of a calibre quite dispro-
portionate to that of the corresponding arteries. Thus the veins of a Selachian have more or less of a lacunar character, reminding
one of what is found in any of the higher Invertebrata, Ib is a question how far
this state of things is primary or ancestral, and how far secondary..
