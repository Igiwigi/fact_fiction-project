There is therefore no doubt that, in the case of the mouse also, the smaller
individuals, having a relatively larger surface, contain relatively more blood than
heavier individuals having a smaller relative surface, and that owr formula B = Wilk
holds good here as well as in the case of rabbits and guinea-pigs, and represents the
experimental facts in an extremely satisfactory way, while the same facts, as we have.
insisted before, are absolutely distorted if the blood volume be expressed in the usual
manner as percentage of body weight. Before summarising the conclusions which we have drawn concerning the blood
volumes of mammals, we wish to draw attention to a fact which is of interest from a
theoretical point of view, namely, that although our formula B= W?/k has been
proved to hold good for the calculation of the blood volume of different species of

animals (rabbit, guinea-pig, and mouse) over a very wide range of weight within
each species, a point appears to be reached when the individuals are very young and
light, where a slight periodical deviation commences, in exactly the same way as is
the case if the surface of the same individuals be calculated from the body weight
according to Mrnn’s formula (S = /W'). This deviation is in both cases due to the fact that the power is slightly too small. If it be taken a little larger, the small periodic deviation disappears both from
Meren’s formula and from our own,
