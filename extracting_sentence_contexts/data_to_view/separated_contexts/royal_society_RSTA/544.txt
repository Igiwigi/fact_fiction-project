We can now repeat the analysis of § 11 using the effective velocity vg cosi instead of vp,

Equation (49) indicates that the ‘fading time’, discussed in § 11, is proportional to (Asect)/v9. When the distance TR is more than 3 or 4 times the height of the reflecting region, sec? is
approximately proportional to the distance T'R of transmission. These considerations appear
to provide an explanation for the observed fact that the ‘fading time’ of radio signals on the
same wave-length are known to be roughly proportional to the distance of transmission. 15. ConcLusIons
