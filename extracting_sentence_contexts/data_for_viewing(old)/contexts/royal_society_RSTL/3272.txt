searches that I was undeceived (par. 221.). B:scuoyy states that during the passage
of the ovum of the Dog through the tube, the yelk undergoes changes in its form,
becoming angular; and he mentions certain granulous rings of what he supposes the
second or inner membrane; also that in some ova from the uterus he found the yelk

found Spermatozon in the Dog between the fimbriz, close to the ovary.
