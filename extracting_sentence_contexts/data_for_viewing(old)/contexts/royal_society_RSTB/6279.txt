when they exist, but which is inadequate to detect, or to disprove the existence
of many smaller differences, which may exist, but which, if they do, would not
greatly affect any judgment as to the completeness of dominance.

The gene for crest, like several others used in these experiments, was obtained
from Japanese Silky pullets, bought from English breeders in 1929, and mated
with a wild jungle cock kindly lent to me for the season by the Zoological Society.
From that time the experiment proceeded as planned, giving, in 1933, crested
birds of the fifth filial generation, which were mated in 1934 with a view to pro-
ducing homozygotes for the mutant gene. The numbers bred in the different
years varied greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock

was crested, while in later years, when the different “dominants” had been
separated, only a single pen was given to this factor. In this, as in some other
lines, breeding and survival were capricious, and the line came very near to
extinction.

The four pullets used for the original cross in 1929 exhibited the five “‘ dominant ”
characters—crest, black pigment, rose comb, polydactyly, and feathered feet—in
addition to the recessive silky feathers characteristic of the breed. They appear
