A
computation of the area of the 2-torus T? gives an identity to be satisfied by the Jacobian:
Jao dx dy = 4n2 = Jae I(t; Xo, Yo) dXo dYo, or in terms of averages:

U(t))o=1, (4.9)

where (f)9 denotes an average over the ‘label’ variables Xo, Yo. Noticing that J is positive as long
as there is no blowup, we can interpret J(t; Xo, Yo) as a probability density on the 2-torus. From the fact that V;, - u, = —y we readily obtain an evolution equation for J:

J; X0,Yo) _

t
Te Xo, Yo) XOXO.) => It Xo, Yo) = exp (- I, v(X(8), ¥(s),8) as) ,

0
and using equation (4.7) we get J(t; Xo, Yo) = [A(#) (1 + (A + 1)y0(Xo, Yo) Jo(1/A(s)*) ds)" V/A),
Finally, replacing this solution into condition (4.9) and defining the increasing function

_ ra —peypyy-1/2
s= | ae => A(t)=[SH], (4.10)

we get a remarkable first-order ODE for S(t):

. = Q+1)\ 2CFD
50 -([ +a+Dn(950)] , $(0)=0. (a1)
0
Once the solution of this ODE is found, then A(t) can be obtained and so the basic fields y, w can be
found explicitly along the pathlines. This ODE contains all the needed information to determine
whether a blowup occurs in a finite time. The initial data for w plays no role.


(c) Singularity time and blowup asymptotics

Combining equations (4.7) and (4.8) with equation (4.10) we obtain y and along the pathlines
in terms of S(t):

S(t)yo(Xo, Yo) 1 Si)
y (X(t), Y(t), #) T+0+ DX, Yos 2040 (4.12)
and
1/Q+1)
o(X(P), Y(B, #) = @o(Xo, Yo) [- +O+ a wn] . (4.13)

A singularity occurs at the first time T, when 1 + (A + 1)yo(Xo, Yo)S(T) = 0 for some (Xo, Yo) € T2,
because $ > 0.
