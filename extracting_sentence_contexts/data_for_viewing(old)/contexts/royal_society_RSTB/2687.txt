Knots in a wood are generally surrounded by resin, and it would therefore be
naturally supposed that a very dense picture of a knot and its surroundings would

be formed, but this is not always the case. Fig. 18 shows a knot in yellow pine,
and although the knot itself is dark its immediate surrounding, which is resin, is
almost without action. In fact, resins evidently vary very considerably in their
power of acting on a photographic plate, and their different degrees of volatility
or general activity may be shown by placing the sensitive plate at a distance above
the specimen of the wood and noting the result; for instance, a plate $ inch above
a piece of deal will give a dark . picture, whereas larch, pitch pine, or oak under
similar conditions act only very slightly on the plate. Of course, the absolute amount
of resin in each case is not known and varies considerably, but this variation in
quantity does not seem to be the sole cause of the different effects produced. There
is another way in which the resins from different sources may be tested. It is by
placing the specimen of wood on a piece of Swedish filter paper, which is a perfectly
inactive body, and heating it to a temperature of 90—-100° C. for 2 hours, then when
cold the paper is removed from the wood and is put up with a photographic plate.
If larch, spruce, or red saunders wood has been used, then the paper on whieh it
