Precisionâ€”recall curves for basenets (tested on entire settlement) and models augmented with 50% of settlement
data (tested on remaining 50%).

only greyscale (panchromatic) imagery, suggesting that the characteristics of the settlement are a
much more important factor for accuracy of structure detection than the availability of multi-band
colour images. The extent to which adaptation data helped detection accuracy is shown for sample settlements
in figure 3, where we zoom in on the high-precision, high-recall area of each curve and show the
different between the basenet and each of the adapted nets. For some settlements, adaptation data
give a strong improvement; other less so, and sometimes with accuracy in fact decreasing. Note
that for each quantity of adaptation data, the test set changes each time (as we only evaluate on
parts of the settlement which were not used for adaptation training). Hence the performance is
not guaranteed to increase with increasing adaptation data.
