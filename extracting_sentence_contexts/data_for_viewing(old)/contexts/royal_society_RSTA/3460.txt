probability [55] it can be proved that

p(n =) => plé =a)p(n = BIE =). (6.5)

It is important to remark that the conditional probability is defined by the Bayes formula: p(y =
B\& =a) =p(n = 8, =a)/p(E =a), where p(n = B,€ =a) is the joint probability distribution of
the pair of random variables. As is well known, in general, for quantum observables, the joint
probability is not well defined. Therefore, the classical Bayes formula for conditional probabilities
is inapplicable and one can expect that, for quantum conditional probabilities which are defined
in the Hilbert space formalism, the formula (5.5) can be violated [35].

The classical LTP in our setting can be formulated as follows. We remind that the probabilities
pi(s; t),s =0,1, depend on the initial state %, i.e. in fact, we could even use the notation p;(s; t|W).
Among the possible initial mental states of the pairs of players (G1, G2), the states ym,k,m =0,1,
play a very special role. Here, initially the players were completely sure in their strategies, G, with
the strategy k and G2 with the strategy m. In (5.5), the probabilities p;(s; t\k, m) = p;(s; tl¢x,m),s = 0, 1,
can be identified with the conditional probabilities p(n = 6|§ = w) with w = (k,m) and 6 =0,1. The
probabilities

pilk,m) =|(Y Pen), k,m=0,1, 6.6)

encode uncertainty in the determination of the pairs of strategies (k, m) for the initial mental state
W. In (5.5), they are identified with the probabilities p(é = a).

The interference-like representation of the DFs (3.8) can be rewritten as a quantum
