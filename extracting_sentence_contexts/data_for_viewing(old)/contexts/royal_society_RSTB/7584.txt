change of habitat caused by the growth of the trees, few of the same areas were studied
afterwards. We can only suppose, on the basis of a wider knowledge, that decrease in
1938 and 1939 was of the periodic type; there is certainly no evidence to the contrary.
We also observe that certain changes in body weight were associated with the change from
high to low abundance (§3), which suggests that the same population process was
common to several areas. Before framing a general hypothesis, however, it is important to
consider various mortality factors which may complicate the picture.

For example, if sheep had broken into a plantation and eaten enough grass the voles
would have starved, migrated or become exposed to other risks. Or there might have been
human interference or catastrophes such as flooding. Such accidents would no doubt
have produced different effects from those resulting from the causes of periodic mortality;
but if only the fact of decrease were known and its specific features had not been studied
then accidents could not be eliminated as possible causes. Since the decrease has been
defined as typically periodic these events would obviously destroy the ‘standing causal
conditions’ implicit in the statement of every hypothesis relating cause and effect. There-
fore, whatever the practical complications, no logical obstacles are raised when accidents
occur. Other types of mortality, however, cannot be so readily discounted, for any increase
in population density is likely to be accompanied by an increase in the rates of several
mortality processes. The problem is to distinguish those which are merely contributory
from those which are necessary and sufficient to account for periodic decrease. Let us
suppose that a declining population is found to be heavily parasitized. It may be known
