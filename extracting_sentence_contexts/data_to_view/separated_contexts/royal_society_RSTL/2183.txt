In the beginning
Sf the poliſh, and indeed for ſome time during the pro-
] Sreſs of it (always remembering now and then to move
Khe metal round its axis) I worked round and round, not
far from and always equally diftant from the center, ex-
Scept that every time, previous to the ſhifting the metal
-0n its axis, 1 uſed a croſs ftroke or two; and: when the
;Poliſh was nearly compleated, I moſtly uſed croſs ſtrokes,
giving a round ftroke or two likewiſe every time I turned
»the metal on its axis. I obſerved in this method of work-
wg, that the metal always poliſhed faſteſt in the middle;

inſomuch, that half or two-thirds of it would: be com»
pletely poliſhed when the circuraterence of it was ſcarcely
touched by the tool. Obſerving this in ſome of the firſt
metals, and not conſidering that this way of poliſhing
was in fact a ſpecies of grinding, and as perfe&t as that
upon the hones, I went on relu&tantly with the work,
almoſt deſpairing of being able to produce a go |
Goure. However, I always found myſelf. agreeab
deceived; for when the poliſh was extended to t
edge, or within the. tenth of an inch of it, I almoſt

conſtantly found the figure good, and the performance
of the metal very diſtinct. But this ſame circumſtance of
apparent defett in the metals, was in fact that to which
their perfection was owing; for they all, contrary to m ,
expectation, turned out parabolic.
