Three rounds were fired from a 12-centimetre B, L. gun with 7 Ib. R. L. G. powder
and the ordinary service lead-coated shot. The energy realised per 1b. of powder was
80'65 foot-tons,

Three more rounds were fired with the lead considerably reduced, and 80 as barely
to fill the grooves. The mean energy realised per Ib. was 78-68 foot-tons, thus
showing that no superior effect was thereby obtained.

Two rounds were then fired with hell fitted with copper rings. The energy
obtained was 82 foot-tons per Ib. and the gain was real, but the chamber pressure ran
up from a mean of 16'8 tons on the square inch to a mean of 186 tons, thus showing
that, at all events in great measnre, the increased effect is caused nob by the copper
bands giving rise to less loss by friction, but to the fact that the increased difficulty of
forcing the copper bands into the grooves permits the powder to become fully burned
at an earlier point in the bore, and thus an increased effect from the powder is realised.

But to show the effect of a greater or less degree of retention of the shot in its

chamber in as clear a light as possible, the following experiments were made. Four
projectiles for a 12-centimetre B. L. gun were manufactured of precisely the same weight,
and which differed from one another in the following respect only : that two of these
were fitted with a rotating gas-check of such a form that a high pressure would be
