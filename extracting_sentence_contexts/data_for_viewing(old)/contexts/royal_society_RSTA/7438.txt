This series terminates ifn*’ and n*” are integers, but in general is of the form of an asymptotic
expansion. It can, however, be evaluated with sufficient accuracy by ignoring terms for

The first omitted term is in fact unimportant, except when the sum of the others is passing
through a zero. The significance of condition (19) can perhaps most clearly be visualized by
noting that it corresponds to neglecting in the integrals of (17) powers of r less than 2. The
main contribution from these comes from the region close to the origin. Thus the maximum of

The limitation imposed on s (that it should be below 2) is a compromise aimed at keeping
7, as small as possible (it can be seen from (21) that it is always much less than the total extent
