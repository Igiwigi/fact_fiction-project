Already, therefore, one can expect analogous glassy effects in an attempt to
solve the random K-SAT problem using a computer algorithm based on local
operations. In fact, however, the p-spin version of the SK model exhibits further
interesting behaviour beyond the p=2 SK original. In particular, there are
several transitions as the temperature of this p-spin model is reduced. Two
of these are thermodynamic; the higher, at Te , is to a state known as ‘one-
step replica symmetry broken’ (1RSB), corresponding to the onset of many
non-equivalent macrostates {5} that are mutually orthogonal (Parisi 1980),
followed by a lower temperature transition, at Ta , to ‘full replica symmetry
oreaking’ (FRSB) (Gardner 1985), at which the non-equivalent macrostates star
o acquire a continuous range of overlaps (as characterizes the SK spin-glass
phase). These transitions are, however, pre-empted by a dynamical transition a
a higher temperature, Tp, again to 1RSB. The fact that Tp > Te means tha
he system becomes glassy before the thermodynamic limit for paramagnetism
is reached.

The analogue in random K-SAT is that, although, in principle, there is a
imit a. separating SAT from UNSAT, in practice, computer programs basec
on local dynamical algorithms are unable to reach this limit but stick at a lower
Q@p, the analogue of Tp. The recognition of the existence and quantification o
he resultant intermediate HARD-SAT region came through the application anc
extension to K-SAT of statistical-physics techniques developed for spin glassses
(Mézard et al. 2002; Mézard & Montanari 2009). In fact, the technique, known as
‘survey propagation’ (and a development of the original cavity method; Mézarc
et al. 1987), can often be applied to specific as well as averaged problems and has
