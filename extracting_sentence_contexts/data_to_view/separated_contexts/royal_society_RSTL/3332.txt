In the present instance, the motion alone of
the limbs was lost, by the destruction of the anterior roots of the nerves ; whilst the
sensibility remained, owing to the posterior roots being unaffected. I am unwilling to enter on $0 great a snhject as the influence of the cerebellum,
and of that posterior column of the spinal marrow which descends from it. Im-
portant as these parts must be in the ceconomy, there are no facts to countenance
the belief, that they are directly connected with the functions of motion and sen-
Sibility. Indeed the posterior column of the spinal marrow has been found softened
to a degree, which we must suppose inconsistent with the continuance of its func-
tions; and yet sensibility has been entire. But let not this fact militate against our
conelusions.
