— of the fittest” depends not on any one quality, but on a capacity for adaptation to a
combination of conditions some favourable, others detrimental.
The idea of a natural alternation, or rotation, as broached by M. Durtav De LAMALLE
(previously referred to a p. 1212), is not strictly applicable to the case before us. That
— there is 8ome such alternation is evident. Tt is not, however, the regular rhythmic
rocess assumed by M. DUREAU, but a phenomenon influenced by the many varying
Airemmstances to which reference has been made, and it is, therefore, in itself very
gariable.* Tt is to be borne in mind that in the Rothamsted experiments, even in the
Fase of the unmanured plots, there are some artificial conditions introduced. Thus,
OM cutting of the crops interferes with the normal course of the vegetation, whilst the
Femoval of them from the land induces a gradual exhaustion. Further, the variations
of season from year to year will have their varied effect, accordingly as the condition
Bf the herbage is affected by such artificial treatment. It fact, it will be seen that
'Fariations of 8eason have a most potent influence on the result, not only under the less
Srtificial conditions of the unmanured, but, also under the more artificial ones of the
Hanured plots.
3 In mos cages we are without data for ascertaining the duration of life of a perennial
Plant, especially when it is 8ubjected to cutting; but we know that there is a limit,
and that, when this is reached, one plant will die, and another will take its place; and
So we may have a fluctuating relative predominance of Graminez, of Leguminose, or
Sepresentatives of other families,
