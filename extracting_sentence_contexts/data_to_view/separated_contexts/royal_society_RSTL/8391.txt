If this is a correct inter-
pretation, there arises for further inquiry the interesting question whether or not the
yerticillate lateral branches are grouped with angles of divergence of 120*; or, in other
words, are they arranged in ternate yerticils, as appears to be most probable? I haye
found no example like the one just described amongst my Oldham specimens. But this
is doubtless accounted for by the fact that nearly every one of the latter, in connexion
with which I have found the nodes, have been young terminal twigs, as indicated by the
regularity with which the leaf-bases remain in 8tu: consequently all their lateral buds
were as yet undeveloped. The bark of Plate V. fig. 27 obviously exhibits the innermost layer (4) in a contracted
or compressed condition, whilst the outer one (#) is of fully double the thickness of that
seen in the large stem, Plate IV. fig.
