From what has been described, it will be remarked that the rock here chosen- for
experiment presents in the highest degree the properties capable of producing disper-
on, delay, and rapid extinction of the wave of impulse, so far as its structure is con-
cerned, although the modulus of elasticity of a very large proportion of its mineral
constituents (silex) is extremely high, and its specific gravity as great as that of Dalkey
granite. Added to its minutely foliated and mineralogically heterogeneous character,
with its multiplied convolutions, we have five great planes of transyerse separation in
the range, one of these forming the plane of junction of the quartz and schist, with

innumerable minor planes of separation at all conceivable angles to each other in both
rocks; and yet we have highly elastic and dense materials forming the substance of both
rocks, and their general mass remarkably free from open veins, fissures, or cavities. We have also two different rocks, the one transmitting the impulse into the other,

ters as to make any great or abrupt effect upon the wave at the junction probable,
In fact, widely to the first glance as the quartz rock and the schist rock appear to
differ, there is less real distinction of physical character between them than would be
supposed: both are composed of the same siliceous, sand, in about the same size of
original grains, yariously enveloped, in the one in chlorite and mica, and in the other
in white or grey clay and mica; both have, in ancient geological epochs, doubtless
derived their materials by degradation and transport from a common $0urce as respects
their main constituent, the silex; both have been snbmitted to approximately similar
pressures, and probably like temperatures ; and the agglutinating flux has probably
been mainly the same for both, viz. the minute proportions of alkalies derived from the

waters of an ancient ocean. The main difference in physical structure, viewed upon, the broad scale, between the
quartz rock and the Slate is this (as regards our experiments) :â€”that the great joints
and planes of separation on the whole approximate to verticality in the former, while in
the latter, with the exception of some larger faults and dykes, the planes of separation
are twisted and involved in all directions, but tend more to approach horizontality.
