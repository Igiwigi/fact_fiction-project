comes nearest to success. This form has from the beginning an additional balancing
organ in the shape of a long, stout ray anteriorly above the head. The height of the
fish relative to its thickness becomes very much greater than in any other Flat-fish.
The air-bladder and long balancing ray disappear together at 12â€”13 mm. ; the dorsal
fin is then firmly attached to the skull, thus forming a fixed dorsal keel. The skull
becomes strongly ossified, so that in flexions of the fish the skull and dorsal part of
the trunk move as one piece. In this condition the later stages of Bothus remain for
a very long period; they are taken at all periods of the year. But the air-bladder
has apparently been too late in its disappearance ; when the dorsal fin becomes
attached to the skull this has already been flexed to the right anteriorly. The base
of the dorsal fin is also to the right of the mean longitudinal plane, which again may
be referred to the influence of the air-bladder, as in the ease of the Rhomboids. How
near this form comes to the normal fish is shown by the fact that the left half of the
skull remains normal.

In contrast to the above and in confirmation of this view regarding the part played
by the air-bladder, we have the Solea forms, in which the air-badder is more or less
on the right side. A possible explanation for the transference of the air-bladder to
the right side in these forms will be given later, meantime it has to be noted that
this position accentuates the left flexure caused by the coil of the gut. The fish
turns over more rapidly than any other type, except in one instance (S. variegata),
which has no air-bladder.

Having thus briefly indicated the parts played by the coiling of the gut, the eir-
bladder and abdominal organs in the balancing and asymmetry of the Flat-fish, it
