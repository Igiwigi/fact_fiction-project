ticular nerves and their endowments ; and, finally, to the examination of these parts
in the centre of the system, the brain and spinal marrow, which enables him to assign
the reason of that perfect symmetry which reigns through the whole.

The subjects of his last paper have been examined again and again by dissection,
and reviewed in eyery aspect. They have been found correct in every particular.
But they necessarily lead to further investigation : they point more especially to a
minute inquiry into the structure of the spinal marrow, and its relations to the en-
cephalon on the one hand, and to the origin of the nerves on the other.

It might be imagined that the author of this paper had, in these inquiries, fol-
lowed his preconceived notions ; but it has not been 80. On the contrary, when
in search of the explanation of certain phenomena, he discovered a fact in the
structure which diverted him from his design, and carried him in a new course of
inquiry *,

In an anatomical investigation of s0 much delicacy, it is necessary, in order to un-
derstand the descriptions, that he who follows it by dissection should have the parts
presented exactly in the same aspect, and trace them in a prescribed manner. When

* The paper on the Voice was undertaken as a preface to the investigation of the accessory respiratory nerves.
In following that subject, the author found it indispensable to deviate into this inquiry, which proves to be the
more important of the two.
