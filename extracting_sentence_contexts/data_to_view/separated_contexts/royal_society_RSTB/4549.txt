Symphurus comes nearest to this condition (fig. 92), but the skull returns later to a
more horizontal position (figs. 93, 95) and a snout is formed where Trachypterus has
none. The skull in the Bothoids is also strongly depressed and likewise recovers to
some extent. The recovery is connected with the fact that the anterior part of the
skull (ethmoid and parasphenoid axis) is flexed upwards again on the posterior part
(figs. 75, 77, 93), and this is the case in all Flat-fishes. In another Teleost the pectoral arch is drawn forward (fig. 98) when the jaws ossify
and the skull is only slightly depressed. The same thing occurs in the Flat-fishes as
a general rule, but here again it is sometimes retracted later, and this retraction is
correlated with the forward growth of the abdominal muscles (fig. 45).
