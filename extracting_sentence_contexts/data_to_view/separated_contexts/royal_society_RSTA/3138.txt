As stated in the introduction, we
want to formulate this principle as a general information-theoretic statement, whose application
should not be restricted to the domain of micro-physics. More specifically, we individuate the
qualitative essence of the Heisenberg principle in the mere statement of existence of incompatible
observables. In the language of measurement algebras this means that a non-trivial quantum
situation is characterized by the fact that it admits at least two different maximal partitions of the
identity.

(A8) Heisenberg indeterminacy principle (weak form). There exist two different maximal
partitions of the identity (Aq) and (Bg). Definition 3.3.
