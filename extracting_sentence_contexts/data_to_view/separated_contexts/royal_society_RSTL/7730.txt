that it affords the means of analysing the separate minerals elected by it ; but even
thus the difficulties are considerable. The quantity of material at one's disposal amounts
generally to a very few grains, and of these but a small proportion consists of the desired
mineral; in fact half a gramme is as much as one is generally able to obtain in a state
of purity. The analysis of 80 small an amount of a silicate is a difficult problem. To break up
the silicate by fusion with alkalies implies the introduction of foreign and non-volatile
ingredients; to estimate the silica by its loss on treating the mineral by ammonium
or hydrogen fluoride were to lose what, in the analysis of such small quantities, is the
necessary check afforded by the summing of the percentages of its constituents.
