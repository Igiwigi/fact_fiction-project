thus the uncompensated traction is passed on from element to element until finally
the boundary of the material system is reached where it remains uncompensated and
must be balanced extraneously. The outstanding irregular part of the aggregate
mutual potential energy of the individual molecules, which cannot be included in a
function of strain of the element of volume, cannot on that account take part in the
transmission of mechanical forces, and is evidenced only in local changes of the
physical properties and temperature of the material. Cf. ยง 48 infra.

The other main division of the energy is the kinetic part, which is specified in
terms of the rate of change of configuration of the material system with respect to
an extraneous spacial framework to which its position is referred. Whatever notions
may commend themselves @ priori as to the impossibility of absolute space and
absolute time, the fact remains that it has not been found possible to construct a
system of dynamics which has respect only to the relative positions of moving
bodies; and the reason suggests itself, that there is an underlying part of the
phenomena, which does not usually explicitly appear in abstract material dynamics,
namely, the ethereal medium, and that the spacial framework in absolute rest,
which was introduced by Newron and was probably a main source of the great
advance in abstract dynamics originated by the Principia, is in fact the quiescent
underlying ether. In this way the purely @ priori standpoint is pushed away a
stage, and we may find justification against the reproach that a philosophical
formulation of dynamics should be concerned only with relative motions.
