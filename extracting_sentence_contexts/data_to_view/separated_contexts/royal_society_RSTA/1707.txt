The approach to the primitive equations by evolution equations is based on the hydrostatic
Stokes semigroup which was introduced first in [23]. Its extension to the setting of bounded
functions was investigated only recently in [24]. The iteration scheme for the nonlinear problem
rests on the fact that the combination of the terms V, P and e!4* nevertheless gives rise to bounded
operators on the associated spaces which satisfy in addition typical second-order parabolic
estimates. The classical Stokes semigroup also plays an important role in the investigation of viscoelastic
fluids of Oldroyd-B type and nematic liquid crystals. The associated semigroups, i.e. the Oldroyd
and the Ericksenâ€”Leslie semigroup, are defined by a certain coupling of the Stokes semigroup to a
transport equation or by the equation for the so-called director, respectively.
