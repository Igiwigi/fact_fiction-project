at 4 p.m. and placed them in the incubator at 23°5° C. On examining them at 9.30
the next morning most of them were found to have grown out to normal rods or
very short chains, all of which showed the same progressive, undulating, and
rotary movements which I had observed before in rods freshly developed from spores.
Another series of cells prepared with involution forms, at 11.30 p.m, December 27th,
and placed at 22°5° C., showed motile rods 10 hours later. In both of these
series active motility became gradually less, until it ceased entirely, about 24 hours
after the cultures were made. Finally a tube of broth inoculated with fresh spores
on December 30th, at 5 p.m., and kept at 23° C., showed at 9 a.m. the next day a
slight turbidity, which was found to consist of actively motile rods and chains. The
latter retained their motility longer than I had ever observed before, chains of seven
or even eight rods still exhibiting slight undulating and rotary motions at the end
of 12 hours. These observations are important, since the fact of motility might very
easily be overlooked, confined, as it is, to the youngest stages of the rods and to
a comparatively brief period of time, and to special media.

Tn old cultures or in cultures made under unfavourable conditions, involution forms
are produced in great numbers and astonishing varieties. Plate 16, fig. 6 shows a
number of these forms from a culture six weeks old on saccharose-agar at 33°. The
culture contains a few swollen but almost normal rods of the form usually preceding
spore-formation, ()), but most of the rods and filaments have become irregularly
swollen, often into long fusiform, inflated, or drum-stick bodies. In these altered
filaments no septation can be seen; the contents are coarsely granular, and include,
especially in the swollen portions, roundish bodies which stain very deeply with
carbol-fuchsin. They show no blue colour with iodine, and are probably oil-drops.
