eight forms A,, ..., H, obtained by interchanging f and J, and sixteen further forms Aj, ..., Hj
derived from these by interchanging ¢ and y. It will be noticed that the interchange of 7
and j interchanges these forms in pairs (A, B,), (A; Bh), (Cys Dn)s (Cis Drs (Ens Fu), (Ens Fn),
(G,, G,,), (H,, H7,), where n,m = 1,2 and n-+m.

In the forms of § 10 replace x by é, j by /, g by j, and u by yj,. Then the forms containing
the factor u, clearly reduce, and we have in fact

Now these forms satisfy the conditions for the invariant reduction (10-5). These relations,
together with the fact that L,, L,, P, are all = 0, imply

Hence we have the relations
