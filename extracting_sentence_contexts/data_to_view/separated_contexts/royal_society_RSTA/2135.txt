As Ramanujan graphs appear when studying PU(2), one expects Ramanujan complexes to
appear when moving to general PU(n). This is indeed so, but the direction taken in §4, of replacing
Qby F,(#), cannot be used anymore, since the latter does not embed in R. The task also becomes
more complicated due to the fact that the naive generalization of RP conjecture to PGL, fails, due
to the appearance of functorial lifts (cf. [39]). For general 1, this is still work in progress, but for
PU(3) (which corresponds to quantum computation on a single qutrit), a complete solution exists:

Theorem 6.3 ([16]). For p=1 (mod 4), there is an explicit Golden Gate set Sy C PU3(Q), such that
(Sp) acts simply transitively on the Bruhat—Tits building of PGL3(Qp).
