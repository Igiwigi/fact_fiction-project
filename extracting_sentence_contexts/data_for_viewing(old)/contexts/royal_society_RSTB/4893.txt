average, within a homogeneous group, genera of 2 species are older than monotypes,
genera of 3 species older than genera of 2 species, and so on. It is therefore of importance
to determine the frequency distribution of ages for genera of a given size, i.e., to determine
what proportion of genera of species, with assigned values of Â¢ and z, are likely to possess
any assigned age. ;

We will first take the limiting case when time is infinite, since the
time is simply to truncate the frequency
at age v.

distribution of the ages of the derived genera
The required expressions for genera of 1 and 2 species have, in fact, already
been given under the integrals of equations (9) and (11) at the beginning of Section IT,
p- 37. Thus for monotypic genera the distribution of ages is given by
