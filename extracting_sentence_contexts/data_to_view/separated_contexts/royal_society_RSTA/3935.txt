I made some
attempts to count all abortive as well as fully developed seeds in certain species, but I
found the task not only very laborious, but my estimates doubtful. Examining for
another purpose Darwin’s ‘ Cross- and Self-Fertilisation of Plants.’ I was struck by
the fact that he did not hesitate for the purpose of comparing their vigour to count
the seeds of plants living in the open and all alike subject to free visitation from
insects and bees. He distinctly states (3rd Edn., p. 115) that “ the difference in the
number of the contained seeds* must depend upon the constitution of the plants.” This view of the matter impressed me without entirely removing my earlier doubts.
