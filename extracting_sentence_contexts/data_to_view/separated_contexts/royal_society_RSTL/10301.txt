and those made by BuxsEN with his chain of sparks given in Table VII. Although
the path traversed by each flame from the point of ignition is very small in Buxsex's
experiments compared with HorsTMANN's, yet since the pressures employed by both
experimenters were near to or above the critical pressures of the mixtures exploded,
this great difference in the length of column had no effect on the division of the
oxygen. The same facts also account for the disagreement between my experiments and
those of BUNSEN and HorsTMANN, For since the firs ten experiments in my series
were made at pressures below the critical pressure of the respective mixtures, both the
lower pressure and the longer column increase the proportion of carbonic oxide burnt. In the four last experiments of this series the increase in the quantity of oxygen
taken brings the critical pressure below the pressure employed. The results are in
close accordance with those of BUNsEX and HorRsTMANN.
