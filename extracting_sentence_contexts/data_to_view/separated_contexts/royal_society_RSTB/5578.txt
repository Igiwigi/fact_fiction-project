C,H,.0.Br, requires Br, 51-6 per cent.). It is therefore 2: 6 (or 2: 4)-dibromo-orcinol
dimethyl ether. On testing the acids III and IV in the same way, it was
found that no precipitation occurred when bromine water was added to a solution
of IIT in aqueous sodium carbonate; this fact, alone, suggests that III
must have the formula XI and excludes VII for the substance II. Clearly,
this requires that IV should be represented by the formula XII and should yield a

neutral bromo-derivative when bromine is added to its alkaline solution. Actually,
this was found to be the case, and the bromo-derivative (probably, 2 : 4-dibromo-6-
ethylresorcinol dimethyl ether, but it may also be a mono-bromo-derivative) crystallised
from methyl alcohol in colourless needles, but was obtained in such small amount that
a fuller description must be reserved.
