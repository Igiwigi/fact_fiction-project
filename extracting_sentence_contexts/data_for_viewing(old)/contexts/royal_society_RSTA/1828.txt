in energies would diverge. This simple renormalization procedure is consistent with Lifshitz
theory [44] and hence has been well tested by precision experiments.

In cosmology, the expansion factor n plays the role of the refractive index. Here n is uniform
in space but varies in time, whereas in the arrangement of dielectric bodies n varies between
the bodies and the background—it varies in space and not in time. The energies and stresses
of vacuum fluctuations should be just the same though, as they are both given by the energy—
momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field (in the presence of the gravitational field or in
media). What differs is only the way energies and stresses act. In AMO physics, the divergence
of the stress produces directly the force density. In cosmology, the energy density and pressure
contribute to the cosmic expansion due to their gravity, as described in the Friedmann equations
(2.3) and (2.5). Yet in general relativity the entire energy and stress is supposed to gravitate, and
not just the renormalized part, which produces a figure that disagrees with fact by 120 orders of
magnitude, as shown in §1. In the view of this obvious conflict with reality, why should we not
take the empirical fact of the astronomically small mass density, equation (1.1), as evidence that
the bare vacuum energy, for whatever reason, does not gravitate?

3. The theory

The bare vacuum energy and stress has not appeared in any experimental test of Casimir forces,
nor does it appear in cosmology. Should we still take it as real? Or should we rather regard it as
an artefact of the theory? Assume that the bare vacuum and stress always need to be removed,
even in gravity. The universe would still create a Casimir energy évac and pressure pyac, because it
is evolving. Instead of changing in space (on cosmological scales) the expansion factor n changes
in time, as if the spatial refractive index profile (figure 2) would be turned into a space-time
