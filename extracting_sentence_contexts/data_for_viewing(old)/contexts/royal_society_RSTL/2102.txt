over tin.* Hence, in conjunction with the preceding reason-
ing, I am led” to. conclude, that they were then produced
independant of any vapour of the metals, and that under the
circumstances' described ; no vapour''of mercury existed at
temperatures beneath 20% F.

Concentrated sulphuric acid boils at about 600® F: but as
the temperature is lowered the tension of its vapour is rapidly
diminished.  Signor BELLAani-F placed a thin plate of zinc at
the upper part of a closed bottle, at the bottom of which was
some concentrated sulphuric acid. No action had taken place
at the end of two years, the zinc then remaining as bright as
at first ; and-this fact is very properly adduced in illustration
of the fixedness of sulphuric acid at common temperatures.
Here I should again presume, that the elastic force which
tended to form vapour, was surpassed by the force of gravity.

Whether it be admitted or not, that in these experiments
the limit of volatilization, according to the principle of the ba-
lance of forces before stated had been obtained, I think, we
can hardly doubt that such is the case at common tempera-
tures, with respect to the silver, and with all bodies which
