Now in the present paper I have considered not only the principles of the
chemical calculus, as regards the formal construction of symbols, but also the primary
application of these principles to the construction of a special symbolic system. In

the symbol of each chemical snbstance a distinct assertion is made as to the chemical
properties of the substance, which any one is at liberty to test by an appeal to facts. Now as no symbolic system similar to the present has yet been devised, and as this
system cannot be deduced from any existing system, every symbol not only makes an
assertion but expresses a discovery as to the chemical properties of the substance 8YIN-
bolized. Tt is obvious, from the way in which the symbol is constructed, that the
properties symbolized are the properties of that system of chemical equations into
which the symbols enter, and from which the laws of the science are to be deduced.
