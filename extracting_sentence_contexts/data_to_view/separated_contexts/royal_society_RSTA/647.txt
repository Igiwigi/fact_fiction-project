Tversky and D. Kahnemanâ€™s work in the 1970-1980s (e.g. [50]), certain
experiments in cognitive psychology encountered situations predicting which appeared to
require (non-additive) probabilistic rules akin to those encountered in quantum mechanics. This,
naturally, suggested using quantum-like models in mathematical cognitive psychology and, then,
economics, in part in view of the fact that certain economic behaviour, too, involves psychological
factors of the type analysed by Tversky and Kahneman. Previously, these factors had not been
considered in mathematical economic modelling or elsewhere in economics. Kahneman was
eventually awarded a Nobel Prize in economics (Tversky died a few years earlier and thus
was not eligible).
