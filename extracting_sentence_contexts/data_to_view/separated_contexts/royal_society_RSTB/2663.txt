BasHrorp-Dray’s conclusions, and we can only suppose that
some concealed imperfections in his specimens have led him to over-estimate their
completeness. On the other hand, the results suggest that the average ratio between
the length of the head and “ tail” is as one to five or six. We are far from denying, however, that some change in the proportional size of
the organs of Palzeospondylus has taken place with growth; indeed, there seems to
be some evidence to show that it has, Thus in our smallest specimen the length of
the head anterior to a line joining the posterior border of the gammation (which
corresponds to a line joining the anterior margins of the postero-lateral masses)
measures 1°35 millims., the part behind this line, 1*1 millims., giving a ratio of
1:18 : 1; in another specimen, chosen for its apparent freedom from distortion, the
length of the anterior part is 2°465 millims., of the posterior 1785 millims., giving
a ratio of 1:38 : 1, thus indicating a more rapid growth on the part of the anterior
region, a result precisely corresponding to that found by Sewerrzorr in his study of
the early development of the Skate (27), but further, the same observer has shown
that this more rapid growth is confined to the rostral region, and does not affect the
rest of the skull behind this region; precisely the same fact is indicated by our two
specimens: thus the low anterior walls of the skull measure 0°25 millim. in the
small specimen and 0°765 millim. in the large one; deducting these quantities from
the length of the anterior division first mentioned, we have in the small specimen
1°35—0:25 = 1°1, and the ratio of this to 1°15, the length of the posterior region, is
1: 1°05; in the case of the large specimen 2°465—0°765 = 1°7; the ratio of this to
1:785 is 1: 1°05, or identical with that found for the smaller specimen. This suggests
that the low anterior skull walls are closely associated with the rostral apparatus. The ratio of 1: 1:05 is so nearly unity as to show that the rate of growth of the
parts to which it relates has been practically uniform.
