bond of union between the numerous fatty elements of the vitelline mass (see fig. 10).

The fluid matters contained in the uterus and Fallopian tubes, were identical in
their physical characters with those noticed in the last case; and the materials com-
posing the recently ruptured Graafian follicle were likewise found to consist of blood-
discs, fibrin and large nucleated cells (se fig. 11). The yellow tissne of the corpus
luteum was made up of a fibro-celluiar stroma, in which there was enclosed a number
of large granular corpuscles, some of which contained oil-globules ; besides these,
there was a liquid fat diffused through the tissue, which appeared either as minute
particles, or as large elongated highly refractive globules that had been produced by
the union of the smaller elements (see fig. 10).

Remarksâ€”An examination of the preceding facts will, I think, justify me in
coming to the following conclusions ; namely, that ovules escape from the ovaries of
women during the catamenial flux; and that the escape of these bodies is spontaneous,
id est, that their extrusion takes place independently of sexual intercourse. In these
respects, the phenomena witnessed are perfectly analogous with those observed by
Biscnory, RaciBorsx1, Poucuer and others, while they were instituting inquiries into
the changes which occur in the ovaries of other mammals during the periods of heat
and rut; and they are also in accordance with a fact long since ascertained by phy-
Siologists, namely, that there is a periodical maturation and spontaneous extrusion of
oyules from the ovaries of animals still lower in the scale of creation. Hitherto,
however, these several circumstances have been regarded only in the light of pro-
bable analogies; but I am of opinion that the facts detailed in this paper are quite
sufficient to identify the phenomena in question, and also to establish the truth of a
