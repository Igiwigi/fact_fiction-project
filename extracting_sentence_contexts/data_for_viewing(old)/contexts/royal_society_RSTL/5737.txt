402 MR. FAIRBAIRN ON THE RESISTANCE OF TUBES TO COLLAPSE.

This constant failure at the joints renders the experiments on internal pressure
unsatisfactory, as they do not exhibit the ultimate strength of the plate, but onl
strength of the joint; and as boilers invariably present joints, these facts are pro√æ
of some significance when applied to them. On a careful examination of the fract;
that of the tube Ef appeared the most perfect. Ke was not 80 well soldered, and
by tearing off the rivet-heads, and Dd was torn partly through the plates and pa
through the rivets; the plate of which this tube was composed was, however, exc
ingly brittle, and broke like cast-iron. Tube Gy was ruptured in the same way and;
the same direction as the others; the rivets were torn through the plates, and the 01d
ing (not very sound) was ripped up for 10 inches along the joint: this tube, as also
others, would have borne a greater pressure had the joints been more perfect and
sounder workmanship.

Comparing the tube Ce, 1 foot long, with the tube FF, 4 feet long, and assuming
joints to be equally perfect in each, it would appear that there is a slight loss of streng
