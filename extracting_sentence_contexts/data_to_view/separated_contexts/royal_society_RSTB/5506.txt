This fine adjustment of an organism to the external conditions of its existence
is the result of a series of gradual changes induced by the environment. Since the publication of Darwin’s epoch-making work more attention seems to
have been paid to the study of animal morphology in its various aspects than to the
habitats of animals. In fact, it is only in recent years that the importance of animal
ecology as a subject for investigation has come into prominence. Several workers in
recent years have denied the existence of “ adaptations,” and the idea of utility in
evolution, which is a necessary complement of the process of adaptation, is being
considered of no importance. For example, one reads ** that characters have arisen at
variance with the innate tendencies of ‘ Heredity,’ and persisted without the aid of
* Natural Selection’? (KYLE, 1926, p. vii), or that evolution is predetermined and in
the unfolding of characters “ selection” plays no part (BrerG, 1926).
