A consideration of the unique morphology of the parts about the Sylvian depression
leads to the conclusion that in Sinanthropus, owing to the unequal and peculiar develop-
ment of the four cerebral opercule, the anterior insular region was most probably
exposed.

The extraordinarily marked development of the opercular portion of the inferior
frontal region on the left side in Sinanthropus is particularly to be noted in view of the
known location in that region of the modern brain of the motor speech centre. Thus
the peculiar development of Brocaâ€™s convolution in the brain of Sinanthropus provides
weighty evidence in favour of the probability that this form was indeed provided with
a cerebral mechanism for the elaboration of articulate speech.

Some confusion has arisen owing to the fact that a full discussion of the cerebral
sulcal pattern as interpreted from some endocranial cast markings has been omitted
in the first descriptions of the latter (BLACK, 1933 a, b), the inference being that their
significance was entirely obscure. Detailed discussion of these markings from the
point of view of anthropological neurology has not yet been published. It is
expected, however, that such a study will follow in due course as soon as an
accurate endocranial cast has been prepared from the adult Locus D_ skull,
the latter specimen at present being in process of complete reassembly of its
constituent fragments. Meanwhile, it may be said of the Sinanthropus Locus E
endocranial cast that the evidences of sulcal pattern there preserved are such as to
leave no doubt whatever as to the entirely hominid status of the brain in Sinanthropus.
The latter presents indeed a number of interesting primitive generalized features, but
these are essentially hominid, not anthropoid in character.
