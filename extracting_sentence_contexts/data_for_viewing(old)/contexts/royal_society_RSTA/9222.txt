The values of 8;, 8, range from points on the B-line down to infinity, the distri-
butions contain concentrated blocks, U-shaped curves, J-shaped curves, rectangles,
trapezoid-like forms and every variety of skewness in doubly limited range curves.
Only in cases where x is very considerable and p is neither a positive nor a negative
high correlation is there an approximation to the Gaussian. For a series of curves
in which §, can be 5 and £, = 9,—or both, if we will—ten times these amounts,
it is idle to talk about the value of the Gaussian curve (6; = 0, 8, = 8) in describing
variation, These frequency curves can be actually obtained by experimental sampling,
although the process is laborious, and indeed were so obtained in the first place.*
They arise from observation and experiment. The remarkable point about them is
that they illustrate all the types we have been discussing and justify sharp transitions
in algebraic forms by showing that such transitions correspond to actual physical
facts arising from experimental statistical data. The whole illustration, details of
which will shortly be published, indicates the evil of implicit reliance on a classical
theory,

The Gaussian theory of error has, with great weight of authority, been applied to
determine significant differences in statistical constants. The theory of the
“probable error” must be justified in the case of each statistical constant to which it
is applied. Psychologists have been busy discussing the differences found in mental
correlations deduced from small samples on the basis of significance judged by the
Gaussian theory of probable error. That theory has practically no application, as the

‘probable error” has really no meaning in the case of the bulk of the samples dealt
with. Applications of the theory of probable error in other sciences than psychology
