In both
tig. 11 and fig. 12 (Plate X'VIL.), for example, we have six balanced sections (RV R', R*R2,
&c.), but only three sections of maximum and minimum bending-moment in the latter
instead of five as before; while we have seen that another slight transposition of weight
would leave only one section of water-borne division and maximum bending-moment. A comparison of the curves of bending and shearing in these two cases possesses further
interest, on account of the fact that when the curve V V in fig. 12 has a minimum Posi-
tive ordinate at R* R* instead of a maximum negative ordinate as in fig. 11, the maximum
and minimum ordinates of the curve M M at e& and d d' respectively in fig.
