(4) The flow of saliva.

The coefficient of oxidation of the resting submaxillary gland, 7.e., the gland with
both the chorda tympani and the sympathetic severed, appears to be much more
constant than the coefficient of oxidation of uncontracting muscles.

The following figures have been obtained :—

Experiments by one of us showed that the submaxillary gland used up more
oxygen when secreting than when at rest. This fact was confirmed for the parotid
gland by Moussu and Tissor(6), This is not only true of the gland when under
the influence of the chorda tympani but also when under the influence of adrenalin,
which presumably is equivalent to stimulation of the sympathetic. The further
researches of BARcRoFr and Piper (18) showed that the duration of the period of
oxidation is greater than that of the secretion both when the chorda tympani is
stimulated and when adrenalin is given.

In most of the experiments carried out in the present series of observations,
pilocarpine was used to cause the flow of saliva, our wish being to maintain as steady
a flow as possible over a considerable period of time.

The flow of saliva therefore is not one of a few seconds’ or minutes’ duration, as in
