Unfortunately the summer of 1902 was not a favourable one for kite work in that
particular locality, as there were a large number of very calm days. On these days,
with the assistance of the tug, there was always a chance of raising a kite to at least
1000 feet, but it was not always possible to get sutlicient lifting power to raise the
instruments. On the other hand, there were a few days on which the wind equalled
or exceeded force 7, a moderate gale; on these days a kite could be, and in fact was,
sent up, but as the Committee were unable, for want of funds, to provide a spare set
of recording instruments, it did not seem advisable to risk the loss of the single set
by sending them up in very strong winds. Between June 19 and August 26, 71 ascents were made with an average height ot
4200 feet (1280 metres). In 40 of these, with an average height of 5900 feet
(1798 metres), records from self-recording instruments were obtained.
