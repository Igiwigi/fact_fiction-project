§ 2. The Rigorous Expression for the Harmones of the Second Kind.

The integral Q; denotes 33,'(%) Q'(%), and %B, denotes Qi(n) 23/(%). Thus
0

G; is, in fact, the harmonic function of the second kind. 4%; is clearly determinable
from @;*.

In the original paper @,* was found by quadrature, and this defect in my procedure
is referred to by M. Lrapounorr as a cause possibly contributory to the discrepancy
between our results. Quadrature was not, perhaps, a very satisfactory method, and
the defect will now be made good by finding these integrals in terms of the / and #
elliptic integrals. It will appear that my former results were sufficiently near to the
truth for practical purposes.

The functions 93/(v) or P(v) are of eight types, determined by the oddness or
evenness of 7% and s, and the association with a cosine or sine function of ¢. In
“ Harmonies” the types are indicated by combinations in groups of three of the four
