16. The last equation shows that (a, ..}n;'—1'S, £8'—Ys, &—tn)*, considered as a
function of (Z x, £'), breaks up into factors. Or since the expression is not altered by
interchanging (Ez', x, £') and (E, 7, £), the same expression, considered as a function of
(5, n, £), breaks up into factors. Tt is in fact easy to see that any quantic whatever,
(#I1nf—1'%, £1 —Y%, &—27n)", considered as a function of (E, 7, £), breaks up into linear
factors; for in virtue of the equation 2(1%'—1C)+1(£E'—YLE)+£(5n'—Zn)=0, any one
of the quantities 1£'—1/C, ZZ —Y'E, &—E'n can be expressed as a linear function of the
other two; 80 that the quantic can be expressed as a linear function of any two of the
three quantities; and gua homogeneous function of two quantities, it of course breaks
up into factors, linear functions of these two quantities.

We may in all the formulez interchange (a, y', z') and (, y, z), writing (a', b', c', f', g', h')
in the place of (a, b, c, f, g, h).
