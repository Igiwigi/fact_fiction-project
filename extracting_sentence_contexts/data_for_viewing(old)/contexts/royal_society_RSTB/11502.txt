key to identifying genetic effects. also be possible to identify the effects of modifiable risk factors
Other studies have focused on extraversion, although the by dissecting the results of newly published genome-wide

samples for these have been smaller and to date have yielded analyses. It is likely that any effects, acting either through


biological mechanisms or via modifiable exposures, are small,
and large sample sizes will be required to detect these effects.
With the recent release of the full UK Biobank sample, in
addition to the increasingly collaborative direction in which gen-
etic research appears to be heading, it seems likely that future
analyses of these individual difference traits will be undertaken
on greater samples, thus increasing power. Despite the fact that
samples may not currently be powered to detect variants
associated with modifiable risk factors at a genome-wide
level, it is possible to interrogate the summary statistics relating
to these analyses and investigate for enrichment of variants and
networks that are known to relate to exposures of interest.
GWASs of other individual difference traits such as repro-
ductive outcomes (measured by age at first birth and number
of children ever born) [77] and educational attainment [78]
have been successful in providing insights into the genetic
architecture of these other behavioural phenotypes. Meta-
analyses of GWASs of both age at first birth and number
ever born have been conducted, and several independent
