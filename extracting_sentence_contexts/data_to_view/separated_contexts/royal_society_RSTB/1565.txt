A

in those Loricaroid forms that have yet been examined, the absence of ove, or even
both, of these elements is Hob unknown in the luss abnormal members of this section
of the fianily. The Hypostomatous genus Acqnuthicus, while in some respects resembling Lorearia
and itsallies, in others exhibits certuin charicteristic features of its own, In common
with the preceding forms, the air-bladder is longitudinally constricted inta two laterally
situated oval sacs with structurally continuous walls, and connected by an intermediate
tubular portion which, as in several of the Loricaroid genera, is supported by a
“processus hijugus.” The presence of a ductus pneuinaticus is uncertain, Wacli

 pperture leading into the corresponding osseous capsule, Ib is difficult to judge trom
‘Ttweswer's description how far conlescence has affected the anterior vertebre, and
whether ony forward dislocation has taken plaice. THis “first” vertebra, as we have
pointed out (p. 178), is probably a “complex,” which may inelude the first to the
fith vevteliee, inclusive, but there is also the alternative that the vertebra has the
sume yaloa as an ordinury “coniplex” in most other Siluride, although the possibility
that the centrum of the Grst vertebra may also be included in it cannot altogether
be left ont of sight. We are of opinion that Rersswar’s ‘first vertebra will ulti-

nately be found to possess the same significance ax in Lorivaria and its allies, but a
cuvefidl re-exumination of this curious Siluroid is necessary before perfectly trustworthy
conclusions can be arrived af.
