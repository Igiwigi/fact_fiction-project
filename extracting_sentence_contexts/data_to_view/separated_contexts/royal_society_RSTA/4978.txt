However, this view is not now generally
held and it is widely accepted that cone cracking is due to the surface radial tensile stress at the
circle of contact between the sphere and the target, generated by the impact. There are, however, relatively few in situ observations from impact loading of glass specimens
with spherical or pointed projectiles. The main reason for the paucity of such studies appears to be
due to the fact that the total contact time between a test glass surface and the impinging projectile, : =
12mm in diameter, is only about a couple of microseconds. Thus, in order to make in situ 3
observations of a small-particle impact on a glass surface and the ensuing damage in the latter, :
specialized high-speed photographic techniques and particle propulsion methods are required. nee)

Such high-speed photography techniques have been available in the Cavendish Laboratory, :
Cambridge, UK, since the 1950s when the laboratory obtained a Beckman and Whitley Model [4

constructed [14] in the laboratory, with which it became possible to make investigations of the .
impact response of a wide range of inorganic glasses [15-20] and ionic crystals [21].
