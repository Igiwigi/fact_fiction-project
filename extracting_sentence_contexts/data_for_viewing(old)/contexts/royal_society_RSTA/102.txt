which does not require a choice of reference frame. But, in this case, some gauge freedom remains; : g
here, if B“ =0, all we can say about ¢p is that it satisfies the wave equation, 0,0" ¢2 =0, which, : 3S
being a hyperbolic equation, does have non-trivial solutions. In this manifestly Lorentz-invariant : Z

formalism, the Goldstone theorem does apply. There are Nambu-Goldstone bosons, and because
the field gz satisfies the wave equation they are massless. But they are not physical, they are pure
gauge modes.

There is one further subtlety. We have spontaneous symmetry breaking in a gauge theory, but : 8
it is not, in fact, the local gauge transformations that are spontaneously broken. Indeed, in 1975, Dos
Elitzur [27] showed that spontaneous breaking of a local symmetry is logically impossible. In _
the Coulomb-gauge formalism, our gauge condition has eliminated the local gauge invariance; : Sy
it is broken explicitly, not spontaneously. But there remains a global symmetry. We chose ¢ to a
be real, or equivalently gz =0, but we could have chosen any other fixed phase instead. (This : &
corresponds to the fact that gz may not vanish but be a non-zero constant.) It is this remaining : a
global symmetry that is actually spontaneously broken. Moreover, it should be emphasized that, : Ss
unlike for example the distinct degenerate ground states of a freezing liquid, our distinct vacuum DNS
states are all physically equivalent. This is because for the phase of ¢, unlike the orientation of : =
the crystals, there is no fixed external reference standard. In our case, there is no true physical : 8

degeneracy of the vacuum.
