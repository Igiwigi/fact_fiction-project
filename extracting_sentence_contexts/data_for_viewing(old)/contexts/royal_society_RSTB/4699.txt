development of toxicity by contact of serum with suspensions, such as kaolin and
barium sulphate, which can subsequently be removed completely by the centrifuge.
Possibly the earlier conception, attributing the toxicity to the removal from some
serum constituent, e.g., from the globulin, of a “ protective” substance, without which
it may act like a “ foreign” body, is the true one. Whatever the precise mechanism,
however, we regard it as certain that the so-called anaphylatoxins produce their
effects not as direct poisons to the tissues, but indirectly by their action on the blood,
on which their action is similar to that which would be expected from its sudden
exposure toa large extent of mildly injurious foreign surface. To the theory con-
necting them with the anaphylactic reaction of the guinea-pig to a soluble antigen,
this seems to be definitely fatal. On that theory the specific antigen should exhibit
its action on the tissue cells of the anaphylactic animal only in the presence of blood,
while the anaphylatoxins should act directly and in its absence. The facts are the
direct converse of this expectation.

While these considerations appear to us to make it impossible to give any general
significance to the anaphylatoxins in the explanation of anaphylaxis, we are not
concerned to deny that their effects may furnish analogies for some of the hetero-
geneous assemblage of phenomena to which this name has been applied. If the term
is to be allowed to cover any of the shock-like phenomena which may result from the
sudden formation of precipitates or agglutination of corpuscles in the circulating blood,
there will obviously be many points of possible analogy between some of the
phenomena called “anaphylactic” and the action of the “ anaphylatoxins.” In our
own view this extension and vagueness of nomenclature is regrettable, as being
