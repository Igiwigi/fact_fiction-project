logically achievable values, given that larger individuals may
have better access to food and other resources, including
(for males) access to females. In species with a polygynous
mating system where body size is a significant predictor of
outcompeting conspecifics, rewards of being somewhat
larger than conspecifics could be much larger than a few per
cent. It follows that individuals, especially males in sexually
dimorphic species, may evolve in a direction that increases
the incidence of cancer.

On the other hand, the result also means that body size evo-
lution can be associated with a substantial cost of reduced
lifespan due to cancer (despite the fact that most causes of
death may remain non-cancer related). If there are other costs
of being large [7], then cancer risk may well tip the balance
from further increases being favoured to being counter-selected.

In reality, ‘all else is not equal’ with respect to at least two
parameters: wand k. The effect of extrinsic mortality y is visible
along the L-axis (L = 1/ gives the expected lifespan were the
individual able to avoid all cancers). Given that lifespans gener-
ally increase with body size [32,34], large-bodied organisms are
generally at the high end of both the N- and L-axes. This is pre-
cisely the region where the cancer-risk costs of increasing body
size are significant. In other words, if an individual is already
