false upper end to B ; or otherwise, if this slice be placed at the lower extremity of B,
as in fig. 17, it is supported by the slider V, whilst T carries the body B. Now it is
easy by this arrangement to remove, by the slider S, the bodies A and B, fig. 16, simul-
taneously, and without interfering with distance a b, 8 as to leave the thin slice Fin
operation on the electrometer disc m. Hence, if we suppose in this case, that A is
charged with a given quantity, and B neutral, we may measure by the electrometer
disc m2 the result of the direct inductive force upon F, apart from the bodies A and B,
and this may be done without the result being influenced by the presence of the elec-
trometer disc m, which may be temporarily turned aside during the previous process.
We may also in fig. 17, supposing B charged and A neutral, examine the reflected in-
duction by withdrawing A and the false end Ã¾ simultaneously, and finally estimating by
the electrometer disc m, the proportion of the whole charge abstracted by the influence
of A at different distances. We may, in fact, obtain any required complicated me-
chanical arrangement peculiar to this kind of research, and arrive at a very complete
experimental analysis of the reciprocal inductive action between the two opposed
bodies, under a variety of new conditions *.

Exp. 27. The body A, fig. 16, being charged with a given quantity and placed
within *2 distance of B, the force upon the electrometer dise amounted to 20*; the
distance m2 F, of the latter being *5 of an inch. The cylinders A and B were now
withdrawn simultaneously, leaving the false end F in place. The force amounted now
to 8? only. This process was repeated with the distance a b = 4, in which case the
remaining force was 4?, or one half the former. The induction, therefore, as expressed
in degrees of the electrometer, was as the distance a b inversely, and, consequently, the
respective quantities of electricity left on the false end f as M1:4/2 (4. The
