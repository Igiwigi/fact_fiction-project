The formula of three terms, deduced from the observations, was
A=99:137 —0-37675t+0-0008728e2,
and that of four terms
A—99-307—0:39301t+0-00123182?—0-0000021938.

From the above it will be seen how much better the obseryed yalues agree with the
formula of four terms. We have, however, contented ourselves with a formula of three
terms, as the conducting powers calculated from it agree with those observed to values
corresponding to 01 or 0*:2, and as the calculations for a formula of four terms would
have increased the labour of the research to a yery great extent. But it may be asked
how it happens that the formule obtained for wires of one and the same metal yary 80
much, in fact, show differences almost equal to the mean of those deduced for the
different metals ?

That this is not due to errors of obseryation we have repeatedly satisfied ourselvyes;

for compare only the formulz of the hard-drayn (or rather partially annealed) and the
annealed wires, and see how well they agree with each other. Tt appears, however, to
be probably due to the molecular arrangement of the wires being different in each case.
Take, for instance, the copper wires experimented with : wire 1 increased in conducting
power by heating to 100? for seyeral days, almost to the same extent as if it had been
annealed, wire 2 partially 80, and wire 3 hardly at all; and here it may be mentioned
that silyer and copper wires become softer and lose their elasticity, whereas gold does not
seem to be annealed at all after having been kept at 100? for several days. Again, take
