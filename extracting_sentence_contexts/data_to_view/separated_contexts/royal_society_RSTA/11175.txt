The point may be graphically demonstrated by plotting out the values on curve
paper, taking temperatures as abscissee and coefficients of cubical expansion as
ordinates. The three straight lines thus obtained, shown in the reproduction given,
will be observed to converge from 0° towards the three temperatures of coincidence,
where crossing of the lines in pairs occurs, beyond which they diverge. The relative
nearness of the lines to each other in the middle of the part where crossing occurs,

together with the fact that the increment 20 is not determinable with the accuracy of
the constant @, the coefficient at 0°, suggests the probability that the three lines
should all cross at one point, somewhere near 136°. At this temperature the value
for rubidium sulphate only exhibits a difference of one in five hundred from the two
identical values for the two other salts, so that the three values are identical within
the limits of experimental error.
