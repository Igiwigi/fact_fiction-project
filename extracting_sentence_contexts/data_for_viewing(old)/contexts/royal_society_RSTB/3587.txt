remember that of the English Carboniferous flora, so universally known and so vitally
important to phylogeny, and always described as so rich, only about 70 structural
species are known at the present day, after more than 50 years’ work by
WittAmson, Binney, Scorr, Orrver and a host of other investigators. When,
therefore, after about two years’ work we are able to present 18 plants from the
newly discovered Cretaceous flora, we feel that there is every promise for the future
of a rich harvest when other investigators have entered the new field and the
necessary mass of material has been examined.

All the species here described are new, and all are described from the anatomical
structure of some or other of their parts. The question of their relationship to some
of the numerous fragments of leaf and stem impressions which have been described
from the Cretaceous of many countries is a difficult one, a question, in fact, which
at this stage it is impossible to answer. That the commonest among our petrified
plants should be, in matter of fact, actually the same natural species as the commonest
among the impressions is very likely, although no weight can be placed on such
an assumption, The same difficulty exists in dealing with the Palwozoie floras,
where the number of impressions correlated with structural material is extraordinarily
small. Our nodules, however, are rather more hopeful in this respect than the

* It will be understood that these Paleozoic nodules contain numerous fragments of many parts of
plants, the débris of a mixed flora.
