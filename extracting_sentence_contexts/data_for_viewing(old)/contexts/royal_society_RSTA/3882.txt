(c) Graphite yield stress

The experimental and computed PPD are compared in figure 7 over a broad range of impact
velocities. Two models have been used in the simulations for the steel yield strength (EPP and JC),
and two models for the graphite yield strength (Yg1 and Yg2).

We first focus on the simulations with the graphite model Yg1. The JC and EPP models of steel
give very similar results, and quantitative agreement with experiments is observed in regime R1.
This is simply due to the fact that, as discussed in ยง3b, the projectile remains roughly spherical in
this regime even with the JC model. The PPD is thus directly related to the graphite yield stress.
Regime R2 is more complex, because plastic deformation of the projectile becomes important and
also plays a role in the PPD computation. This regime is thus where the sensitivity to the steel
model is expected to be the strongest. However, the JC model does not improve the simulation
results in this regime, and underestimates the experimental PPD. This may be partly due to the
fact that, as noted in ยง3b, our JC model predicts too much deformation in regime R2, causing an


excessive drag on the projectile. Another reason may come from the graphite yield strength. For
this reason, a second graphite model Yg2 has also been studied.

The simulations with Yg2 show the sensitivity of the PPD to a slight reduction of the graphite
