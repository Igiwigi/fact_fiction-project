may now compute the relation between epitope size L and
number of idiotypes in the BA model by using (3.35) and
B<1. This results in a scaling relation N ~ VLe%, with
y<1, as opposed to the bit-by-bit repertoire size, which
would grow as 2" [76, pp. 5-13].

Hitherto, we have been able to characterize idiotypic net-
works using only basic assumptions for chemical affinity,
which has led to a dense ER. But what kind of computations
is this system able to perform? And how does the IS use its
autopoietic features to distinguish the self/non-self? To pro-
