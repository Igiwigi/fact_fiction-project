Our first interesting finding was that full randomization
resulted in networks that were less efficient in routing communi-
cation. Notably, this result diverged from the sharp increase
in routing efficiency observed when non-cost-conserving
randomization models are applied. When conserving cost, ran-
domizing brain connectivity is necessarily accompanied by a
thinning out of the fibre densities (shown in the distribution of
the fibre density of randomized networks, figure 2), because
most randomized connections span greater distances; such
low-density connections do not contribute towards efficient
routing communication. Full latticization of brain networks
does not produce perfect lattices because of the constraints
imposed by the rewiring rule; in fact, a comparison of the
fibre length and density distributions between the latticized net-
works and the respective empirical networks reveals great
similarity between these networks. Latticized networks differ

have a strong tendency to become weakly connected.
These new projections appear as a result of rewiring of
edges away from denser pathways, thus sculpting their over-
all pattern into a new topology and steering the population
towards one of the four Pareto fronts. Second, most of these
newly formed projections extend over long spatial distances,
while most of the projections that become weakened
involve nodes that are spatially close, including node pairs
