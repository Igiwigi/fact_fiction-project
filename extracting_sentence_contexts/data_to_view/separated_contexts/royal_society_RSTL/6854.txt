The superior power of the acid is most decided in the smaller
= tensions; ata tension of an inch it is twice that of the olefiant gas. The s8ubstances
Â© approach each other more closely as the quantity of gas augments. Here, in fact, both
S of them approach perfect opacity ; and as they draw near to this common limit, their
= absorptions, as a matter of course, approximate. Z The temperature of a hydrogen-flame, as calculated by BUNSEN, is 3259? C., while that
S of a carbonic-oxide flame is 3042* C.
