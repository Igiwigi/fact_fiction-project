If M=T? is the 2-torus and b<¢ L*(M), then the energy decays with the rate O(t-2), and
the decay improves to O(t-4-*)) for certain b « WE°(M), no matter how small the support of
b; see Anantharaman & Léautaud [97, Theorems 2.3 and 2.6]. On the other hand, for simple
characteristic functions b, the optimal rate of decay is O(t-?/) [97,103], no matter how large the
support of b. The fact that the regularity of b may play a more important role than its support is
also nicely illustrated in [104-107]. If the manifold M has strictly negative curvature and no boundary, and if y is a hyperbolic
closed geodesic in M and the damping b vanishes in an e-neighbourhood of y but is positive
everywhere else, then the energy decays semi-uniformly with the rate O (ee!) by [26,
Theorem 1]; see [27, Theorem 1.1], [89, Section 5], [90, Corollary A2], [108, Theorem 1] and [109]
for related results. The results in [25], [26, Theorem 1] and [27] are particularly interesting since
they show that the energy of classical solutions may decay exponentially without the semigroup
(Zo(t))1>0 being exponentially stable; this provides another counterexample to the equality of the
exponential growth bound and the spectral bound.
