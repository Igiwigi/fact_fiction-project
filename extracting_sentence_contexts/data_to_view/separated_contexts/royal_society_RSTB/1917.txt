A less usual variant occurs in F, vesiculosus and F. serratus, and in Ascophyllum
when the partition walls, instead of swelling up and disappearing, split so as to form,
together with portions of the endochite, coverings for the individual eggs. And it
may happen that the membrane thus remaining round each egg does not disappear at
all, however long they may be kept in the sea-water. This fact has its bearing on
TuuRET's eXperiments on unfertilised eggs to be referred to later. As regards Ascophyllum, Tourer has figured (“Rt. Phye.,” XXII, 12) a case which
frequently occurs in this species, although, as far as our material is concerned, not
the most common one, We find that in the majority of instances there is no sharply-
