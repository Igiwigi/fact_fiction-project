T was also partly filled with the same salt solution.

The dotted lines are electrodes and the two troughs were connected in series with a
battery as shown.

The electrical resistances of the two troughs were now made equal by altering the
amount of solution in T, the depth of this solution being then taken as the value of hy.

When the current passed from A to B h, was 1 -34 cm., while for C to D it was 1-14 em.
The mean of these two numbers, 1-24 cm., was taken as probably corresponding most
nearly to the irregular arrangement of eggs under the hen.

hy was calculated from the fact that when the difference between the vapour pressures
inside and outside an egg is 1 mm. of mercury 2:4 = 10-* grms. of water passes on the
average through each square centimetre of shell surface per 24 hours; but the value
obtained for h, proved to be so small (0-08 cm.) that it does not seem worth while to
give the somewhat elaborate argument by which it was obtained.

It thus appears that

h=h, +h, = 1-24 + 0-08 = 1Â°82 cm.

in a nest for which, when filled with eggs, the distance between the two surfaces is
4} cm.
