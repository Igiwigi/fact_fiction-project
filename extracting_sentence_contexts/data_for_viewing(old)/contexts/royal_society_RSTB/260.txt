undergoes at a later stage, I am led to believe that the diagram (fig. 56, Plate
represents their mode of origin; two appear to come off on the right side and ti
on the left, one of the latter forming in fig. 19 the median ventral chamber. Fig.
is orientated for comparison with fig. 57 (which will be explained later), and is
from the posterior end. 5

Barrots (3) denies altogether the existence of any forward prolongation of
ccelom into this region of the body; but, since it seldom exists till a few hours be!
fixation, and is much obscured afterwards, this is not very surprising. Far
suprising is the fact that the anterior body-cavity and its pore seem also to ha:
escaped his notice.

Gorr®, on the other hand, figures an enormously wide prolongation, into which
tapering cord of splanchnic mesoderm runs from the mesenteron. He gives
explanation of how this state of affairs arose, and I have no doubt that he has
confused together the anterior body-cavity and the forward prolongation of the righ
body-cavity.

Perrier, however, aceiophe Gérrr’s figure (11, Plate 25, fig. 10) as correct,
attempts to prove from his own sections of the cystid that the chambered organ
arises from the fusion along certain lines of a central cord of splanchnic peritoneum
with a surrounding sheath of somatic peritoneum (19, pp. 123, 139, and 163). But,
