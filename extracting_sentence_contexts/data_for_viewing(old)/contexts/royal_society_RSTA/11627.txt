than those employed by Lapiace.

§ 5 deals with the integration of these equations. The forms of solution discussed
in the present paper are those which are symmetrical with respect to the axis of
rotation. The types of oscillation represented by these solutions have been named
by Lapuace, “ Oscillations of the:First Species,” but he omitted to discuss them in
detail on the grounds that the oscillations of such character, which might be
expected to exist in Nature, would be modified to such an extent by friction that
they would be far better represented by the old “equilibrium theory,” than by a
dynamical theory which failed to take due account of the action of friction. The
tides in question will be of long period, the shortest of the periods being half a lunar
month in duration, but Professor Darwin was, I believe, the first to call attention
to the fact that this length of period will hardly be sufficiently great to render the
effects of friction of such paramount importance, and hence he added to the work of
LapLace a discussion of the long-period tides when not subject to frictional
influences. I have recently attempted to estimate the effects of friction on the tidal
oscillations of the ocean,* and the results at which I have arrived fully confirm
the view of Professor Darwin as to the small influence of friction on the lunar-
fortnightly tides, and vender it highly probable that the effects will be almost
equally slight on the solar long-period tides.

The method of integration I have employed differs from that used by DARwix, my
aim having been to express the results by means of series of zonal harmonies instead
of by the power-series obtained by him, ‘The advantages of this are two-fold; firstly,
