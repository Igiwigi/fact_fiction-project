These two lines are, indeed, the great feature

Sf the photograph. Being of great intensity they do not confine themselves to the
rominence regions, but appear as bright lines through the corona and over the body
Sf the moon. The light which is due to them must, in fact, have been s0 strong that
he scattered light was sufficiently intense in our atmosphere to give the appearance
and to be conspicuous everywhere in the neighbourhood of the moon, or else that the
ns forming the image on the slit was 80 illuminated as to give this result. It can,
Indeed, be traced to a distance of quite three solar radii. In addition to these lines
She hydrogen lines must, of course, be expected to be present ; and, indeed, their identifi-
ation presents no difficulties.
