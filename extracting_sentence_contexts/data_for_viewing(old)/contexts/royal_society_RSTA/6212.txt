(i) Cosmological stability 78

We mentioned in Part A of this survey that the most important property of the Einstein static :8
universe was its transient character. This is based on its instability, as in the Eddington—Lemaitre —
cosmology. In fact, the issue of the instability of the Einstein static universe is much wider, and :
has been investigated by different authors who proved instability in various current contexts.

Starting with a radiation-filled Einstein universe, instability was shown in terms of
inhomogeneous oscillatory modes [79], or in a fluid-filled model with respect to conformal metric
perturbations (where the interesting result is that there are regions of stability depending on the
sound speed) [80,81]. Studies of instability were then exploited by Ellis & Maartens to introduce
the emergent universe [82], where in the context of inflationary cosmology, the Einstein static model
serves as a prequel to the inflationary stage: an transient initial state with matter being a scalar
field whose vacuum energy determines the cosmological constant of the model. This model has
no singularity, no horizon problem and, most importantly, does not need a quantum era in its
early evolution, it is past eternal. Its instability of the initial Einstein static state is proved [83], but
the effects of other, inhomogeneous, nonlinear perturbations are not yet concluded (see, however,
