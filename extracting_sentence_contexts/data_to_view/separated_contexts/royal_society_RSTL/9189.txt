I have used as reference lines the bright lines of such metals as are present in the
sun, the wave-lengths of which can therefore be directly found on AngsTROM's map. The lines of iron are very useful in this respect. The interpolation formula which is usnally employed is based on the fact that the
difference in refractive indices of two lines varies nearly as the difference between the
inverse squares of the wave-lengths. Tf reference lines can be found sufficiently close,
the formula does pretty well ; but I find that for the dispersion which I have ugsed,
the formula is no longer applicable when the distance between the reference lines is
about ten times the distance between the two sodium lines. As it is nob always
possible to find good reference lines within that distance, I have generally used three
reference lines, and taken the inverse fourth powers of the wave-lengths into account.
