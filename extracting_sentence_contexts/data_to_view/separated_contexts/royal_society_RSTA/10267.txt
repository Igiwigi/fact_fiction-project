Trans.,’ A, vol. 201, pp. 497-549) Mr. Rictarpson suggests
that the effect of hydrogen on the negative leak which I have observed can be
explained on his theory by supposing that the hydrogen diminishes Q while A
remains constant. But, as we have just seen, the fact that the leak is proportional to
p shows that Q is constant and A proportional to p. When p is greater than about
02 millim. it is found that Q does diminish as p increases, but A does not remain
“tonstant.
2 Mr. RicHarpson also suggests that my process of cleaning the platinum with nitric
acid may deposit a layer of negatively charged oxygen on it which would increase Q
vand so diminish the leak.
