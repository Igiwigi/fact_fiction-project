sphere when its axis of rotation is in the plane of that great cirele. The only axis
fulfilling both these conditions is that coinciding with the intersection of the two diametral
planes.

It was at the extremity of this axis C C' (fig. 17) that the movable centres were
always in contact ; but their snccessful action was not due to this fact, but simply
because they, together with the supporting roller, fulfilled the other conditions.
These conditions, which can really be approximately, but never perfectly, fulfilled,
may be briefly stated as three in number :â€”

(1.) No slipping mus take place.

(2.) Each set of rollers must always be in contact round the great circles
