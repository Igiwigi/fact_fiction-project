measurements being given. .

In addition to the Table (A) of actual measurements, another (B) is given in which
comparison is facilitated by taking the length of the vertebral column as = 100 and
expressing the remaining measurements as percentages. It is only by using some
such method as this that the changes of proportion of various parts of the body
during the course of development can be clearly shown. In comparing Notornis with
other Rails (26) I took as my standard the length of the trunk as measured from the
anterior end of the coracoid to the posterior end of the pelvis; Fireriverr (11)
employs for the same purpose the length of a thoracic vertebra. But both these
methods would preclude the comparison of the earlier stages, and on the whole I am
disposed to think that the standard here adopted answers the purpose satisfactorily.
Graphic representations of the same facts are given in Plates 6 and 7. In fig. 45 the
various parts of the body ar represented in a conventional manner, the vertebral
column being made in each cass 100 mm. long, and the head, limbs, ete., in proportion.
In figs. 46-49 the curves of growth of certain important regions are shown separately,

The following are the most important results obtained by this method of enquiry.

The brain-case remains of about the same relative size up to Stage F, when it
begins to grow less rapidly than the vertebral column. The age at which its ultimate
or minimum proportional size is attained is not known, but in a young bird several
weeks old (Stage L) it was not yet reached.

The beak, which is undeveloped in the first three stages, is of about the same size
