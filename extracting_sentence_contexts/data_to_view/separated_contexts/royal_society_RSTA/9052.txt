We have also an equation expressing the fact that ), and ,y (the first approximations

to VY, and Y,y) are orthogonal. This and the four equations like (3.7) give the determinant equation—a cubic in 8H'

The three roots of this are SE!, SE", SE™,

Having found dE! from (3.9), we have a,,' in terms of X; 9/X,y 9 from (3.7), since
a,'., etc., are known from Heisenberg’s theory.
