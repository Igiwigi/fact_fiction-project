values of the constants of heredity hitherto observed.

It will be time enough to consider other more or less general Mendelian formule
when there is far better evidence than exists at present that they cover a real range
of observation, and have not been solely invented to describe isolated experiences, the
numerical results of which are not in complete accordance with simple Mendelianism.
Given such neo-Mendelian formule, there is a perfectly straightforward mathematical
method of applying them to randomly mating populations, but that method is
excessively laborious, and the biometrician may well hesitate to undertake the task
of their investigation. A few minutes suflice to invent a Mendelian formula, but
weeks of labour may be involved in testing whether it leads to legitimate results
when applied to sexually crossing races. Let us therefore have a few simple general
principles stated which embrace a// the facts deducible from the hybridisation
experiments of the Mendelians; these can form the basis of a new mathematical
investigation, but it is idle to undertake such an investigation so long as Mendelian
Principles remain in a state of flux.

Any combination of the theory of pure gametes here discussed with homogamy, or
with fertility correlated with homogamy, or again with prepotency of individual or of
type, would emphasise the correlations which we have found above to be too low;
but such hypotheses would involve a fundamental alteration in the formula

(a+ @) (A+ A’) = aA + aA’ + d/A’ + AA"

Such a formula would then give the possibilities of the cross, but the proportions of
