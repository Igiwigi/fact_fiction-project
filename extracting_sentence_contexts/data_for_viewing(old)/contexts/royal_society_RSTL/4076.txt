In effect, without stopping to insist too much on what may be but vague in the
physiological data, I cannot bur admit that the nervous force increases independently
of the will, with every increase in the activity of the functions of circulation and of
respiration, and of every act of nutrition, as aJso under the influence of certain agents
introduced into the organism. A great many experiments have fully convinced me
that the electric shock of the torpedo increases with these same vital actions. Thus
the torpedo in water, a little above the ordinary temperature, produces stronger dis-
charges ; the effect is precisely opposite if the respiration or the circulation of the
blood of these fishes be hindered. The torpedo and the gymnotus give discharges
deereasing in strength in proportion to the number given, and they reacquire their
faculty of giving more powerful shocks after an interval of repose. The torpedo, over-
excited by nux yomica, gives shocks more powerful than usual. This Jast and the
preceding facts establish the connection between the intensity of the neryous force
and that of the electric discharge of fishes,

I trust that I have demonstrated in this memoir, which contains the summary of
my numerous researches upon the phenomena of electric fishes, that there exists in
the electric organs of these fish a very simple case of relation between neryous force
and electricity, established by well-determined laws.
