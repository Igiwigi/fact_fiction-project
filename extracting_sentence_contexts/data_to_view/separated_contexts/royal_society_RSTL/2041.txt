It is perfectly
true that Cavgnpisy *, WoLLasToN F, CoLLapon + and others, have in turn re-
moved some of the greatest objections to the acknowledgement of the identity
of common, animal and voltaic electricity, and I believe that philosophers
generally consider these electricities as really the same. But on the other
hand it is also true, that the accuracy of WoLLasTox's experiments has been
denied \, and that one of them, which really is no proof of chemical decom-
position by common electricity (309. 327.), has been that selected by several
experimenters as the test of chemical action (336. 346.). It is a fact, too, that
many philosophers are till drawing distinctions between the electricities from
different sources ; or at least doubting whether their identity is proved. Sir
Humensy Davy, for instance, in his paper on the Torpedo ||, thought it probable
