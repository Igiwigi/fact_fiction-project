Of these conditions, the first three have already been given by Masson for the
measurement in gelatine. In aqueous solutions a refraction boundary may occa-

* This refraction margin may be shown to a large audience, or as a lecture experiment, by means of
projection lantern, when it is seen on the screen very clearly and distinctly. Tt The best test of a pair of boundaries lies in the fact that if their velocities U and V bear a constan
ratio to one another they are probably both good, if the ratio is not constant one or both are bad, and
is easy by plotting the velocity curve to see whether the boundary fulfils the required conditions. VOL. CXCVIII.â€” A.
