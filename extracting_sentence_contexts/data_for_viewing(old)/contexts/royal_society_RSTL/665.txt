tusks.

Female skulls, with full grown tusks, must be rarely met
with, since the only well authenticated account upon record
MDCCCX1II, S


1g0 Sir E, HoME on the Tusks of the Nartehale.

of a skull with two tusks of equal Hs is that given by
Dick PETERSON.

These facts make it necessary to take from this species of
whale the name. given to it by Linxzvus, of Monodon Mono-
ceros, since they prove that-it is a very improper one.

The greatest length which has' been given to the left-tusk,
before the right has cut the gum, is fifteen feet: this account
is mentioned by EcEpe in his Natural History of Greenland,
1741,

The lower jaw, both in the male and female, has a rounded
edge, in which there is no part from which teeth can grow.
