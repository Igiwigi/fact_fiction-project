(Plate 19, fig. 7, and Plate 20, fig. 21). On reaching the poles the two masses of chromatin
become completely disorganised (Plate 20, fig. 22), and the spindle disappears. Asters
have never been observed attached to the spindle during this or the subsequent division.

It is due to the work of PRowazrx (53) that a second nuclear division was first
demonstrated. NAwascuIn considered that there was a single nuclear division before
spore formation. Since, however, it is quite impossible to count the number of the
chromosomes with any accuracy, we have no direct evidence that the first division is
a reduction division in which the chromosome number is halved. We have, therefore,
to rely upon indirect information. A number of metaphase plates from the first
division were measured and their diameters compared with a similar measurement of
those of the second. The average diameter of the metaphase plate in the first division
was 1-6 Â», while that of the second division was 0-8 wu. This fact was also clearly
brought out by a comparison of Plate 19, fig. 6, with Plate 19, fig. 8. We feel, therefore,
justified in maintaining that a meiosis does occur in the nuclear divisions prior to the
formation of spores, which have, therefore, the haploid chromosome number.

The stages in the second division are essentially similar to those of the first division,

except that, owing to the smaller size, the details cannot be made out so well. The
prophase cannot be satisfactorily demonstrated in the majority of our preparations,
though in some instances we have observed a loosening up of the chromatin which has
