In this computation the mean of the results of all the expe-
riments in the foregoing set is taken as a standard to ascertain
the value, expressed in atmospheres, of y, and it is y x 1.844
= 0gj178,4- w

But if, instead of taking the mean of the whole set of expe-
riments as a standard, we select that experiment in which the
force exerted by the powder appears to have been the greatest,

yet-in this case even the initial force of fired gunpowder, com- F
puted by the above rule, would be much too small. ;

In the experiment No. 84, when the charge consisted of 18
grains of powder, and the density or value of z was os, a
weight equal to the pressure of 10,977 atmospheres was raised,
Here the value of y (= 2*****) is found to be (702'"*Â®),
= 4421.7; and to express this value of y in atmospheres, and
at the same time to accommodate it to the actual result of the
experiment, it must be multiplied by 2.4826; for it is 4421.7
(the value of y expressed in equal parts) to 10,977 (its value
in atmospheres, as shown by the experiment), as 1 to 2.4826,
and consequently 4421.7 x 2.4826 = 10,977. *

If now the value of y be computed on the same principles,
when z is put = 1000, it will turn out to be y = 1000'+*+
= 15,849; and this number expressed in atmospheres, by mul-
tiplying it by 2.4826, gives the value of y = 99,346 atmo-
spheres. This however falls still far short of 54,752 atmospheres, the
force the powder was actually found to exert when the charge
filled the space in which it was confined. But in the 84th expe-
riment, when 18 grains of powder were used, as the weight
(80811bs. avoirdupois) was raised with a very loud report, it
is. more than probable that the force of the generated elastic
fluid was in fact considerably greater than that at which it
was estimated, namely, greater than the pressure of 10,977
atmospheres. c

But, without wasting time in fruitless endeavours to recon-
cile anomalous experiments, which, probably, never can be
made to agree, I shall hasten to give an account of another

set of experiments; the results of which, it must be confessed,
were still more various, extraordinary, and inexplicable. The machinery having been repaired and put in order, the
experiments were recommenced in July, 1798, the weather at
that time being very hot. The principal part of the apparatus, the barrel, had under-
gone a trifling alteration : upon refitting and cleaning it, the
diameter of its bore at the muzzle was found to be a little in-
creased, 80 that a weight equal to 8081 Ibs. avoirdupois, instead
of being equal to 10977 atmospheres (as was the case in the
former experiments), was now just equal to the pressure of
9431 atmospheres.
