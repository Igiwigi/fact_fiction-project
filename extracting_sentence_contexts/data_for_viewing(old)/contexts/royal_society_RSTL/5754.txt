POWER OF METALS AND ALLOYS TO CONDUCT HEAT. 367

is probable that Cu 2Zn and Cu 37n are definite compounds, for not only have they
conducting power of their own far below that of the metals composing them,
also they are perfectly crystallized. The most splendid of all the brass alloys is the
y CuZn, which is of a beautiful gold colour and crystallizes in prisms, often 3 centims.
'These crystals are also interesting on account of their extraordinary elasticity.
hs surprising that 80 cheap an alloy has not been employed in commerce, for no com-
mercial brass contains more than 30 to 35 per cent. -of zinc, whilst the above one con-
tains 50-68 of this metal. The only explanation that we can give of this fact is, that
if copper be alloyed with more than 50 per cent. of zinc, the alloys formed do not
8 the colour of brass, but become white as zinc, and therefore the manufacturers
have never tried to unite these metals in the exact proportions given above. We say
Sat, for it is remarkable that a variation of a few per cent. in the relative proportions
the two metals no longer yields the beantiful alloy which we have noticed. but only
= white and comparatively useless one.
