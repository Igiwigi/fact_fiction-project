uninsolated gas can easily be introduced into the insolation vessel while the action is
progressing. If this be done, a large decrease in the rate of action is at once noticed,
and the combination may cease altogether if sufficient quantity of gas be introduced.
Then an induction period sets in as in the case of a fresh gas mixture. But the
attainment of the original maximum is only performed gradually compared with the
case of the fresh gases. This will be made clear by the experiments represented in
fig. 14. At first the gas was illuminated and, after a period of inertness of about
20 minutes, the acceleration period represented in curve I, fig. 14, took place. After
the maximum action had been reached, a quantity of uninsolated gas, occupying
about 400 millims. of the index tube, was introduced while the light was still on the
mixture. The index came to rest and an inert period of about 1 minute occurred.
The acceleration period then set in, but was very much longer than in the case of the
original gas ; in fact, the rate of action was increasing slowly for as long as the index
could be followed, and the maximum action was not attained. This is shown by the
eurve IT, fig. 14, being very much flatter than curve I.

If the mixture be left in the dark for some time before illuminating, after fresh gas
has been added, this retarding effect passes off to some extent, and the attainment of
the maximum action is not so gradual. Curve III, fig. 14, represents the occurrences
when the same gas as for curves IT and I had again about 400 millims. of fresh
uninsolated gas added, and was then darkened for 5 minutes. The action is seen to
