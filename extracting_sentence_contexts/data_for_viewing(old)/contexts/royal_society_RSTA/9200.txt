‘Making use of these facts we see that the variable part of W, ¢.e., the part depending
on the direction (J mn) of magnetization is

105 p2a? [P (l4 + m4 + nt) -+ 6Q (Pm? +- min? 4- n2l?)]/ 85°.
Replacing Z/' by 1 — 2 = m?n* we simply get, omitting the constant part,
105 (8Q — P) (Pm? +- m?n® +- Pn®)/4s°.
This, it will be remembered, is the contribution from one magnetic element. The

density of these elements in the crystal is 2o~* per unit volume.
Therefore the internal energy per unit volume is

HE; = 105 ya? (8Q — P) E mn? /2 0s.
As regards the part arising from the presence of the external field H, it is seen to be
