Taking the mean of ten of his experiments
on the blood of the Horse and Calf (five on arterial and five on yenous), the total
quantity of the mixed gases he obtained was, in the instance of arterial blood, 10-4 per
cent. per volume, and in that of venous 7'6 per cent. ; the former consisting of about

6:5 carbonic acid,
24 oxygen,
1'5 azote ;
the latter of
5:5 carbonie acid,

1'1 oxygen,
1'0 azote. On a suhject of 80 much importance, it is very desirable that the experiments of
M. Macxus should be repeated and verified ; for until this is done, considering the
physiological history of the blood, it will be difficult to ayoid doubt, and to depend on
them with that degree of confidence which is justly due only to well-authenticated facts. The ingenious apparatus employed by M. Macnus being difficult of construction,
and not easily used excepting in a well-appointed laboratory, I must leave the repeti-
tion of his highly interesting experiments to those inquirers who are more happily
Situated than myself for engaging in them. On the present occasion I shall limit
myself to the detail of some experiments instituted with a view of testing M. Macnus'
general results.
