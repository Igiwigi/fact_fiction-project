The apparent mis-match between peripheral nerve effects
and behaviour is somewhat unexpected. It is possible that
this is due to ELI-induced re-wiring in the central brain or
in descending, inhibitory circuits [2,28], neither of which
was functional in the nerve recording preparation we used
here. These central mechanisms may function to modulate

evolutionarily ancient processes of primary nociceptor hyper-
excitability after injury [29], resulting in an animal that
gains the fitness benefit of persistent hypersensitivity while
ameliorating the costs of inadvertent signalling to predators
via hyper-responsive injury-induced behaviours. The fact that
such complex effects appear to occur only in response to
injury in early life, and are opposite to those observed in
adults with acute injuries, suggests that there are unique selec-
tion pressures shaping early-life plasticity in response to injury.
We suggest that injury that occurs in the early post-hatching
period is likely an indication of a high-danger environment,
and in such circumstances, injury-induced, lifelong changes
to nervous system function may bean effective way of establish-
ing an escalated baseline response to perceived threats, such
that costs associated with hyperexcitability are outweighed
by benefits of lifelong, protective behavioural effects.
