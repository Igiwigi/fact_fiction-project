When sporangia are situated on the cylindrical process, tracheides were always
found in the underlying tissue. The subsporangial tissue was usually distinguished by
its smaller cells which did not contain chlorophyll. In this, its cells resembled those
of the middle lobe. Fig. 55 represents a longitudinal section through the tip of the
process in fig. 38. In the tissue beneath the ramenta and sporangia there is a group
of tracheides.

The question arises whether any relation can be traced between the sporangia and
gxual organs. While a comparison of the abnormal archegonia described above and
fe imperfect sporangia suggests the possibility of the development of a sporangium

m an archegonium neck, the facts as yet observed do not permit of any satisfactory

@nclusion. The usual position of the imperfect sporangia would be diflicult to
s√©plain on any such view.
S The two preceding species have been described in considerable detail, since some of
te departures from the normal which they present are of special interest. The
Bhaviour of other cultures will be described more briefly, only those results which
pissess a theoretical interest being dwelt upon. This method of treating the subject
@ facilitated by the general similarity of the phenomena in the different species.
