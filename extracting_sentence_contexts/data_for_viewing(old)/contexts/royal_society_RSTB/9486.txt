value that can be drawn from forensic case data, both from
court and intelligence viewpoints. With a holistic process
and active management of a case only those trace examin-
ations that have the potential to answer relevant questions
would be conducted, minimizing the potential wasted cost
of performing trace examinations that are poorly targeted.

Successfully managing the return to the generalist
approach will help remove the silos that have been identified
in all reviews. Additionally, such generalists may be more
effective to lobby for trace evidence in terms of global
benefits to policing and justice. In 2008, DeHaan [30] had in
fact already identified that the generalists of the 1940s,
1950s and 1960s had been progressively replaced by the
1990s generation of forensic scientists focusing on a specialty,
and not appreciating ‘the true role they play’. In other words,
it is crucial for trace evidence experts not only to acquire and
maintain competencies, skills and experience at the appropri-
ate level of generality, but also to develop and keep a keen
interest in the crime situation and investigation, in general.
Reflecting on Kind’s work, Ribaux et al. [24] is critical of
the pure analytical scientists who bring little value to the
investigation if they know nothing about the problem they
are supposed to help solve.
