and the equation F'= o'— m' D' becomes
f'=8+ 2. (9

This js in fact an equation of differences between the con-
secutive values of f, and the general value may therefore be
obtained by integration, or its particular ones deduced in suc-
cession from each other, when the integration is impractica-
ble from the values assigned to m, @, and ?. The greatest
simplification it appears to admit, is its reduction to an equa-
tion of the 2d order and first degree, which may be performed
by assuming p

It will not be necessary to examine particularly all the inte-
grable cases, or to discuss at present the form of the general
value of or fin terms of 6, m, and f. This latter subject
is elegantly treated by Lacrance, in a Memoir © Sur Ia
Theorie des Lunettes,” in the collection of the Academy of
Berlin, (Acad.
