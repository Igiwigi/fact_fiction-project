as in the figure, with a semi-cireular portion to avoid the point h = 0; we thus see
that in the above definite integral there must be a sudden diminution of phase mz in
the integrand as cos yf passes through the value we ; if this be taken into account

the definite integral will represent the function P, (4) for purely imaginary values
of 1; there is however nothing in the definite integral itself which decides apart from
convention what the change of phase in the integrand shall be as it passes through its
zero value. Next suppose p to cross the imaginary axis, the / integral can then be taken from

function P,, (1) is no longer represented by the definite integral, but that the value

Q function so defined would not in general possess any kind of symmetry about the
