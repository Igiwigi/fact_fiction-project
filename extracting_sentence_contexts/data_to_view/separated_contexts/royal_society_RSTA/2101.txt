When we proceed to systems of weakly coupled : s
oscillators, the coupling force from the other oscillators will simply be regarded as a sort of 13
perturbation acting on the oscillator in question. {=

In the phase reduction, the unperturbed system is given by a single limit-cycle oscillator : a
running along or near the closed orbit. There the phase of the oscillatory motion represents a : =
neutrally stable degree of freedom. Similarly to the oscillator near the Hopf bifurcation, weak : =
coupling force from the other oscillators and weak external drive, if necessary, are treated as [3
perturbation. : =

The fact that the unperturbed system contains a neutral mode implies that its solution as 8
t— oo includes at least one arbitrary parameter. For instance, the solution of the linearized if
system at the Hopf bifurcation as t > oo is given by a harmonic oscillation z = iwz, where the : s
complex amplitude z may be multiplied by an arbitrary complex number. For a limit-cycle motion : §
along the closed orbit, the phase ¢ changes as ¢ = or ¢ = wt + , where the initial phase yp is : S

arbitrary.
