OF THE PEDUNCULATE BARNACLE LITHOTRYA 105

brought about, according to my views, by hydrostatic pressure controlled largely, but not
entirely, by the dorsal longitudinal muscles, and only in this sense can they be referred to
as the extensor system. The dorsal longitudinal muscles are not simple, any more than are the ventral muscles,
but a detailed description would not be significant to my argument. The relevant fact is
that the dorsal series is divided into two distinct parts (figure 6), the anterior group—
Nussbaum’s retractor corporis (1890, p. 26) and Batham’s ‘mantle-body-wall muscles’ (1945,
p- 368, figure 17)—and the posterior group—Nussbaum’s longissimi and Batham’s ‘lateral
body-wall muscles’. The latter run from the terga of the hind end of the body downwards
and forwards to end below the stomach on the dorso-lateral walls of the prosoma.
