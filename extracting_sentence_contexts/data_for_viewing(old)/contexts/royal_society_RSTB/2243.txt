complete segmental (spinal) nerves, and the skin-fields of peripheral nerve-trunks, as
far as I have myself investigated them, resemble in this feature the divisions of the
trigeminus (see below, p. 101).

Analysis of the sensory portion of the cranial Vth nerve, therefore, by this method
fails to resolve it from a single segmental nerve into a series.

The fact that the fibres of the sensory root of the trigeminus, namely, the fibres
running proximally from the Gasserian ganglion, have a long region of origin (from
the mid-brain in front to the level of the IInd cervical nerve behind) also fails as an
argument in proof that the nerve belongs to a number of metameres. The fibres
from the root ganglion of a spinal nerve grow into the central nervous axis, and there
penetrate to various distances, becoming connected with not one segment, but with
many ; thus, those of the sacral ganglia reach even to brachial and to bulbar seg-
ments. As regards the so-called surface origin of the sensory spinal root, it is not
very uncommon to find filaments of the hinder of two nerve-roots crossing filaments
from the root next in front, demonstrating to the naked eye the insufficiency of the
surface origin of the root to serve as criterion of segmental position, ef: infra, p. 145.

It is the position of the ganglion, and not that of the so-called spinal “origin,” that
