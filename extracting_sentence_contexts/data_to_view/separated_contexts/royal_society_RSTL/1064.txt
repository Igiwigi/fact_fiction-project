The two nerves were readily found, both of great
8ize; the one a continuation of the superior maxillary branch
of the fifth, the other a continuation of the respiratory, or
seventh. Having brought this investigation to a conclusion, some
perhaps, fatigued by its details, may ask to what does: this
discussion lead ?

Were we to enquire no farther, and to rest content with

the inference, that the two sets of nerves distributed to the
face have distinct functions ; even this must prove useful both
to the surgeon and physician. To the surgeon it must be
useful, in performing operations on the face, as well as in ob-
serving the symptoms of disease ; but especially to the phy-
sician must these facts be important ; he will be better able to
distinguish between that paralysis which proceeds from the
brain, and that partial affection of the muscles of the face,
when, from a less alarming cause, they have lost the controul-
ing influence of the respiratory nerve. Cases of this partial paralysis must be familiar to every
medical observer. It is very frequent for young people to
have what is vulgarly called a blight ; by which is meant, a
slight palsy of the muscles on one side of the face, and which
the physician knows is not formidable.
