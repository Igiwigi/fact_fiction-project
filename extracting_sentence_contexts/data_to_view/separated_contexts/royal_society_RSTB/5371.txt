In other mammals, the lamina supracochlearis seems
to have disappeared, and it is replaced by the cochlear capsule. ‘The alicochlear com-

missure growing backwards therefore becomes attached to the cochlear part of the
auditory capsule. ‘The loss of the lamina supracochlearis in these mammals must be ;
associated with the fact that the cochlear capsules have grown in beneath the lateral 4
edges of the basal plate, and the latter have become superfluous. The attachment of ;

the alicochlear commissure on to the cochlear capsule may therefore be explained as
due to the loss of the lamina supracochlearis and its replacement by the cochlear
capsule. ‘
‘Turning now to the relations of the suprafacial commissure, if, as just described, the
auditory capsule has grown inwards and substituted itself for the lateral edges of the
basal plate, and at the same time the brain-cavity has not decreased (on the contrary,
it has certainly increased)
