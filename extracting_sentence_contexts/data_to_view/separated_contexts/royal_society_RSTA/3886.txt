In
addition, it is likely that the off axis anomalies observed at TAG result from a significant amount
of ‘integration’ from multiple other vent sites that are known to exist, north of the section [6]. The approach followed to date is useful because appropriate TEI: *He ratios for hydrothermal
plumes above sites of venting can be coupled with global-scale hydrothermal ?He fluxes to drive
global biogeochemical models [48] or extrapolate and derive global TEI budgets [24,49]. That
approach takes advantage of the fact that primordial 5He trapped in the Earth’s interior leads to
enrichment of He/*He ratios in the mantle by a factor of approximately 8 relative to atmospheric
values [50,51]. These same enrichments are transferred through submarine venting to the oceans
where, because He is geochemically inert in the marine environment, enrichments in 3He can be
used as a conservative tracer of hydrothermal plume dilution and dispersion over long distances
[26]. By contrast, even those TEIs that may superficially mimic dissolved He distributions in
hydrothermal plumes (e.g. dFe, figure 2) do not act as such purely conservative tracers of physical
circulation.
