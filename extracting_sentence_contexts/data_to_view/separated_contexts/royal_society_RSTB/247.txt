S When I first discovered that in some Skates the electric organ consisted of cup-
shaped bodies, I was inclined to look upon the cups as primitive structures, which,
Shaving been arrested in their growth, had failed to develop into dises, such as exist
Bin R. batis and R. clavata. 1 was all the more in favour of this view when I made
Sout that the discs of R. batis passed through an indistinct cup stage, and that in
SR. radiata not only were the cups small and simple compared with the discs of
gh. batis, but the entire organ was only a few inches in length, and only about 8 mm.
3 in circumference at its thickest central portion. When, however, I found that the
cups in R. cireularis were large well moulded bodies, with an electric plate nearly as
© extensive as the electric plate of the disc of FR. batis; that the electric organ of 2.
fullonica, which also consists of cups, was relatively large and well developed ; and
that the development of the cups in 2. radiata was extremely slow ; and also that,
instead of showing signs of degenerating, they continued to increase in size in the
adult forms, it was no longer possible to feel so confident that all the electric organs
consisting of cups had been arrested in their development. Further investigation convinced me that the electric cups were quite distinct struc-
tures; that, in fact, while in some Skates the electric elements had assumed the form
of dises (e.g., R. batis and R. clavata), in others they had taken the form of cups (¢..,
R. cireularis and R. fullonica); and that it was as unlikely that a fully developed

cup should be converted into a dise as that a disc should be moulded into the form
a cup.*

In endeavouring to determine the present réle of the electric organ of R. radia
it may be better first to state the arguments in favour of its being a degeneratin
structure.
