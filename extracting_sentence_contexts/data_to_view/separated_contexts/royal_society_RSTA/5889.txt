Note that the length scales /2at cancel out because of (4.2). In the
case of the Burgers equation, this last form provides the general solution. Before closing this subsection it may be in order to emphasize the following fact. In terms
of the scaled velocity potential @(&), the exact solution is given by = —2v log(1 — (1/2v)¥),
whose leading-order approximation agrees with the scaled heat flow @() ~ Ge). This confirms
the near-identity nature of ®(é).

(b) 2D Navier-Stokes equations

In 2D incompressible flows, the source-type solution is given by the Burgers vortex, which is not
only near-Gaussian, but also exactly Gaussian.
