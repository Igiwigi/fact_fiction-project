matic errors maintained over a long set of readings were found. These increased random and
systematic errors when the cylinder was very close to the magnetometer are not fully
- understood, but may perhaps be associated with the high electrical conductivity of the
_ cylinder, leading to an electro-magnetic coupling between the pendulous mechanical
oscillations of the magnetometer and its torsional oscillation. If the magnetometer has a
slight pendulous swing, its field will induce currents in the cylinder, and the field of this
current will react on the magnetometer. If the cylinder is not perfectly centred or levelled,
it seems possible that a net couple might be produced leading to a systematic error depending
sensitively on the centring and levelling.

Asa result of these larger errors for small values of z it will be noticed from table 11 that
the standard error of the final determination of Wis lower for z = 9-4cm than for z = 7:-6cm,
in spite of the fact that at the smaller distance twice as many readings were taken and the
S expected field is 50 % larger. For large values of z, the error of W will be larger again owing
& to the reduction of the expected values.

Thus one can conclude that better results would have been obtained by making more
measurements at values of z of about 9 to 10cm.

If the greater random error for small values of z is, as suggested, due to the high con-
ductivity of the gold and copper cylinders used, one would expect smaller errors using a
material of lower conductivity, for instance, lead. Unfortunately, the two lead cylinders
tried out had too much ferromagnetic impurity to be used satisfactorily.

Probably the largest source of systematic error lay in the field due to the magnetization
