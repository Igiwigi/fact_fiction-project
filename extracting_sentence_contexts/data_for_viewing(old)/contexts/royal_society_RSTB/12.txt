disposition.”

The plants in the ditch were certainly more apt to be diseased than others in the
open, because the disease, once established, could spread like an epidemic under the
conditions existing. I have other facts in other connections which bear out this, and
I hope some time to be able to devote special and continuous attention to this
question. i

I do not propose to enlarge upon the subject of the resting-spores. After some
months in the dormant condition they put forth promycelial tubes, from which
sporidia are developed which seem to behave like the conidia described ; the type of
germination is like that of Tilletia.
