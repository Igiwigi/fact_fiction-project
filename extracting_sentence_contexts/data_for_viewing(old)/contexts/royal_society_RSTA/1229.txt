convergence for all A > w.

The second remark is that in fact each semigroup {T,(t),t > 0} may be defined in a different
Banach space, say X;; the theorem remains in force provided that X, in a sense converge,
as r— 1, to the space X where {T(t),t > 0} is defined, with technical changes related to the
way (2.2) and (2.3) are then understood. This modification is important from the viewpoint
of stochastic processes, and has been devised so that approximation theorems may cover the
case of diffusion approximations (H.F. Trotter’s paper [5] was based on his PhD dissertation,
and his PhD advisor was William Feller). For reasons that will become clearer in the following
sections, we will, however, restrict ourselves to the case where all semigroups act in a
single space.

The third and final remark is that convergence in (2.2) is in fact, by nature, uniform for
t in bounded subintervals of Rt: you may prove it for all t>0 separately or, as is usually
easier, prove (2.3) for just one A >, and the convergence in (2.2) will turn out to be uniform
anyway. This result initially seems to be a bonus, and to some extent it is, but later this will
be shown to be the biggest shortcoming of the discussed theory: the Trottter-Neveu—Kato
Theorem cannot describe a convergence that is not uniform for f in bounded subintervals
of Rt!


(b) The convergence theorem

The proposition discussed in the preceding section has a version applicable to the case where
the limit semigroup is not known, and even its existence cannot be a priori granted. The Trotter—
