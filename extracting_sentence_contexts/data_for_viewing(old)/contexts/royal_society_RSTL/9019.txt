value of scientific work never lost faith in the substantial accuracy of PasreEUR. One
striking example of his penetration has an immediate bearing on the conclusion regarding
Bacterial clouds, independently drawn by me from the deportment of the tray of one
hundred tubes. On the 28th of May, 1860, PasTeEUR opened, on an uncovered terrace a
few metres above the ground, four flasks containing the water of yeast. Nothing
appeared in any of them until the 5th of June, when a small tuft of mycelium was
obseryed in one of them. On the 6th a second tuft appeared in another flask ; the two
remaining flasks remained intact and without organisms. On the 20th of July he
opened, in his own laboratory, six flasks containing water of yeast. Four of them
remained perfectly intact, while two of them became promptly charged with organisms.
Â© PasTEUR infers from these observations the non-continuity of the cause to which s0-called
spontaneous generation is due. This inference is quite in accord with the notion of
Bacterial clouds snggested by my observations. PASTEUR, in fact, sometimes opened
his flask in the midst of a Bacterial cloud and obtained life, sometimes in the interspace
between two clouds, and obtained no life.

Not with a view of repeating this observation, which had been forgotten, but for another
reason, I opened on the 6th of January last a number of hermetically sealed tubes in
one and the same room of the Royal Institution. The names of the infusions contained
in the tubes, the date of sealing them up, their condition before opening on the 6th,
and their appearance six days subsequently on the 12th are given in the accompanying
statement. I chose for these observations tubes which contained a little liquid in their
drayn-out portions. In every case the motion of this liquid, when the tube was broken,
indicated a violent inrush of air.
