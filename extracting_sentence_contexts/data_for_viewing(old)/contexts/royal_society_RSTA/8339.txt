* The order of the surface in question is just the number of lines which meet six planes in [4]; and this

is known to be five. See Seare ‘ Rend. Palermo,’ II, pp. 45-52 (1888), in which he gives an account of
the quintic surface in question and the duality between F and Y.

Any one of the cubic surfaces [ projects from any point of itself by means of a
quadric point-cone of © ; and it projects from its directrix line* by means of a line-cone
of ®; and all point cones and line cones of ©, o% and o!' respectively, arise in this
way. Hence M;5 is the locus of vertices of cones of &. Some of these cones have their
vertices on ¢;. In fact the surfaces [ project from any point P of c, by means of o!
such cones which have all the same vertex P, and which have in common the elliptic
quartic cone Ky by which c, is projected. The section of these is an ordinary pencil of
quadric surfaces. ‘This contains four cones which, joined to P, give the four line cones
of © whose vertices pass through a given point of cs. Any one of the point cones in
question contains two of the surfaces [, say T, and T,, im such a way that planes of
one system of the cone project generators of [', from P, and planes of the other system
project generators of [,; while [,, [, and K, make up the complete intersection of
the point cone with M,*®. A line cone of ® however meets M,° in Ky and in a surface T°
repeated, i.¢., a line cone of © touches M,° along one of the surfaces T.

can also be attached to the corresponding plane of V,°, and we shall speak in future of
