various series of the true Ferns,

two foliar types had a common origin, from a primitive leaf-type which was potentially
fertile ; certain of these leaves became by abortion of the sporangia sterile, and per-
formed exclusively the assimilating function, while others—or parts of them—
remained fertile. Zhe progressive sterilisation thus contemplated for Ferns is similar
in its main features to that which may be traced in the Lycopods. The fact that in
certain Ferns all the leaves, even the primordial leaves, are actually fertile has a very
definite bearing on this question.*

Turning now to the sporophylls, there is a prevalent type which underlies the
various modes of arrangement of the sori on the leaves of Ferns ; a comparative study
ot the species, even in those genera which, like Polypodium, include forms with sori
apparently scattered irregularly over the leaf-surface, shows that the arrangement is
referable back to that in which the sori form a single superficial or marginal series on
either side of the midrib. Where there has been enlargement of the leaf-area this
type may be greatly obscured, but even in such genera, when the species are
numerous, the reference to this simple type is usually clear. Now, this was the
prevalent type of the sori in the early Eusporangiate Ferns, and, with the exception of
