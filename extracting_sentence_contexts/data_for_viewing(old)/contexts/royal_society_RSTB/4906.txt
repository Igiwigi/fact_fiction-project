The fitted distribution is, it will be seen, a poor fit to the actual distribution, the fitted
frequencies being badly in defect over the range from /, to f inclusive. Over this range


BASED ON THE CONCLUSIONS OF DR. J. C. WILLIS, F.R.S. 61

observation would give a total frequency 4,470, while the fitted distribution would give
only 3,841—a deficiency of 14 per cent.

But the question also arises, what is the effect of a distribution being compound as
regards 9 ? In all the preceding work we have assumed ¢ to be the same for all genera
in the group, an assumption which is on the face of it very unlikely to be in accordance
with the facts. To carry out a test on this point I took the two distributions

p = 1-8) p =2-0)
A ee Tre | 7=8 J
and assumed them to be compounded in equal proportions, giving :—
4 M
e=—13 T= 0-43481 12-247
o=2-0 7=8 0-33350 31-000
Compound 0-384155 21-6235

Fitting the compound as before, I find approximately
6 = 1-603 = = 8-293
