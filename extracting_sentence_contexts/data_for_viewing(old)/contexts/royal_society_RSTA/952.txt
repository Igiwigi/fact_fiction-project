of tests with various levels of automation on highways, e.g. Audi’s tests with an autonomously : 2
driving car on highway A9 between Ingolstadt and Nuremberg. Whereas this kind of legal 14
experimentalism has also been implemented in other domains, such as finance, such an approach : _
should be expanded to further fields of AI and robotics. After all, in the early 1980s, Western car 4
producers had to learn a hard lesson when Japanese industry first began to implement robots 7s
on a large scale in their factories, acquiring strategic competitiveness by decreasing costs and : S
increasing the quality of their products. Nowadays, it seems wise to admit that we should follow :S

once again Japanese thinking and their policy of setting up special zones for AI robotics empirical

testing and development. As stressed time and again throughout this paper, most of the issues we

are dealing with in this field of technological innovation should in fact be tackled pragmatically.
But, how about the USA?

(d) Competitive federalism

Another example of secondary rules of change is given by Justice Brandeis’s doctrine of
experimental federalism, as espoused in New State Ice Co. v Leibmann (285 US 262 (1932)). The
idea is to flesh out the content of the rules that shall govern social and individual behaviour
through a beneficial competition among legal systems and in accordance with the principle
of implementation neutrality. This is what occurs nowadays in the field of self-driving cars
in the USA. On the one hand, regulations are by definition specific to that technology and
yet do not favour one or more of its possible implementations. The Federal Automated Vehicles
Policy adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation in September 2016, illustrates this legal
