in unserem Urwalde Gestein nirgends zu Tage tritt, ist bei diesen grossentheils an
Urwaldsbiiumen lebenden Arten wohl kaum an Aehnlichkeit mit mineralischen
Substanzen zu denken. Alle Puppen, die ich im Freien an Pflanzen zwischen Laub
gefunden habe (z. B., Morpho, Caligo, Prepona, Siderone, Catanephele), sind griin,
mit Ausnahme von Acrea (ungeniessbar), deren Puppen weiss sind, mit schwarzen
Domen.

“Mit dem Bedauern, dass ich iiber Ihre Ansichten in Betreff der goldigen Puppen,
die mir sehr annehmbar scheinen, so gut wie nichts aus eigener Erfahrung sagen
kann, &c.’’

The use of the gilded appearance as a warning in Mechanitis seems to be very
clear, and the fact that the pups hang in companies must of course greatly add to
the effect, and this is probably the meaning of the habit (so common, for this reason,
among many distasteful and conspicuous larvee). It seems probable that the gilded
spots of Adelpha are instances of persistence with protective value among changed
surroundings and withdrawal from the substance originally imitated. From Dr.
Miixr’s letter it is quite clear that the resemblance to mineral substances cannot be
of any protective importance in the Brazilian forests, but it does not therefore follow
that such surroundings would not intensify the appearance even now. Thus
V. urtice in England has been shown to be rendered very brilliant by gilt surround-
ings, although in nature it can rarely receive such a stimulus, and the amount of
gilding on it is very small or entirely absent. It is satisfactory that Dr. MULLER
should consider my suggestion a probable one as to the biological significance of the
gilded appearance.
