That of the coal afforded it in great abundance. Hence it appears, that these different modifications of tux=
pentine. yielded the tanning snbstance only in proportion to
the quantity of their original earbon, which, by oxidizement,
had been progressively converted into coal.*

Other substances, when reduced into coal in the humid way,
were in like manner formed into the tanning substance by nitric
acid. In fact I found this to be the constant result, and amongst
the many substances which were examined, I shall mention
various kinds of wood, copal, amber, and wax, all of which,
when reduced to coal by sulphuric acid, yielded similar pro-
ducts, by subsequent treatment with nitric acid. But this substance may likewise be artificially produced
without the help of nitric acid, although in a less proportion,
as well as with some slight variations in its characteristic pro=
perties; for, as I have already observed, when any of the resins
or gum resins ( such as common resin, elemi, asa fcetida, &c. )
have been long digested with sulphuric acid 80. as to assume
the appearance and general characters of coal, if afterwards
they are digested with alcohol, a portion is dissolved, and a dark
brown solution is formed which by evaporation yields a mass
Soluble in water as well as in alcohol, and which precipitates
gelatine, acetite of lead, and muriate of tin, but produces only
a very slight effect on oxysulphate of iron. This $ubstance,
therefore, which may thus be separated by alcohol from the
coal formed from resinous bodies by sulphuric acid, evidently
contains some of the tanning matter, which has been produced
during the carbonization of those substances.

* Some late experiments have however convinced me that carbon need not be abso-
lutely converted into coal in order to produce the artificial tanning substance; but this
will be more fully explained in a subsequent Paper.
