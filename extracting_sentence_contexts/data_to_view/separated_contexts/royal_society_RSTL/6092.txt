264 DR. HERMANN KOPP ON THE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT

to those hitherto noticed, the following also deserve to be mentioned, since they are like-
wise observed in other compounds. The foregoing Tables afford many illustrations of the facts, that the boiling-point of an
acid lies 63? higher than that of the methyl-ether, 44* higher than that of the ethyl-ether,
and 132 lower than that of the amyl-ether of the same acid. These regularities appear
to obtain in the case of acids other than those quoted. The boiling-point of monochlor-
acetic acid (185*%â€”188*, R.
