Its tracheal bundle, b, consists
of the ordinary type of barred vessels, but in its centre, a, we find three or four distinct
columns of parenchymatous cells, of the same type as those common in the interior
of Ferns, DE Baryâ€™s medullary cells. The periphery d consists of cortical cells. This development of medullary cells in the interior of a large Halonial or Ulodendroid
bundle is a notable fact, which we shall shortly find to have some special significance. That the bundle is a true tubercular one is beyond question. There still remain for consideration some additional observations respecting true
Lepidodendroid strobili.
