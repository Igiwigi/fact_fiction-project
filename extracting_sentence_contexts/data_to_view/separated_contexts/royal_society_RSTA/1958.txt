This is very close to the mean of the 43000 shown in the table and a line
(4) 43019-17, ie., 43009-87. In other words, these two lines are (¢) (28;)Ss and (¢) (— 26,) Ss, indicating
that the normal Ss line has been split into two by displacements +26, on the limit (or + equal displace-
ments in sequent). Both linked lines are seen, but only one of the lines themselves, which is possibly
due to the fact that they are close on the limits of the observed region. We shall find indisputable
evidence of such displaced parallel series as a general phenomenon. $ (5).
