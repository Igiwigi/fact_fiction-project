A 376: 20170384. A global framework for treating nonlinear differential

dynamical systems is presented. It rests on the
fact that most systems can be transformed into
the quasi-polynomial format. Any system in this
Accepted: 30 April 2018 format belongs to an infinite equivalence class
characterized by two canonical forms, the Lotka—
Volterra (LV) and the monomial systems. Both
forms allow for finding total or partial integrability
conditions, invariants and dimension reductions of
