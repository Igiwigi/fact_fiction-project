However, parallel imaging is usually affected by the coil geometry factor (g-factor) [4,5]
under higher acceleration factors resulting in a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio. By contrast,
CS algorithms can restore original data from undersampled k-space by exploiting the sparsity
of an unknown image in the total variation (TV) [6,7] or wavelet [8] transform domains, and
incoherent sampling schemes such as Gaussian random or Poisson disc sampling are usually
required. These CS studies focused on designing new objective functions and optimization
algorithms, but they ignored the fact that the reconstruction process was computationally
inefficient and required a significant amount of iterations to converge. Recently, deep learning has been widely used in medical image processing, such as
disease classification [9-13], anatomic segmentation [14-19], organ registration [20-22] and
lesion detection [23-25]. Besides, emerging studies based on deep learning have reported
promising results to reconstruct high-quality MRI images from the undersampled acquisition.
