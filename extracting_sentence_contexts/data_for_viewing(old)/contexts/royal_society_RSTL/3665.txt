DR. MARTIN BARRY ON THE CORPUSCLES OF THE BLOOD, 241

exhibited in figs. 139, 140, observed in similar situations in others of these larvae (for
a particular account of which I refer to the explanation of the Plates), induce me
farther to believe that the crystalline may have its origin in a 8imgle corpuscle, having
the same appearance as a corpuscle of the blood.

The Elements of the Spermatozoon and those of the Ovum compared with Corpuscles
of the Blood.

182. Thad made the principal part of the foregoing observations,—when two others
followed, which had not been at all anticipated. For, although the facts observed
had led me pretty nearly to the conclusion, that every tissne in the body has its origin

A in corpuscles having the same appearance as corpuscles of the blood, —yet the thought,
@ I confess, had not occurred, that the spermatozoon and the oyvum might be imme-

S noticed, by which I recognized corpuscles having the same appearance as altered
E blood-corpuscles, in some seminal fluid under examination, from the testis of a Bird,
= that the idea suggested itself, and led to a farther examination.

& 183. The experience gained during the long investigations, the principal results of
E which bave been mentioned in the preceding pages, now make it easy for me to see
