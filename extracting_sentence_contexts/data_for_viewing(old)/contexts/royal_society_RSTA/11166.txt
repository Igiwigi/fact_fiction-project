ON THE CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE OF METALS. 371

The experiments on iron were extended to certain steels. In very mild steel slip-
bands can be readily observed in what are generally called the “ferrite” areas, which
remain white after light etching. This is shown in fig. 45, The first effect of strain
is to develop the inter-granular junctions in these white areas, then more severe
straining makes the slip-bands appear. In steels containing larger proportions of
carbon, the scale of the granular structure of the “ferrite” diminishes and the
slip-bands become correspondingly minute, requiring the highest powers of the
microscope for their observation. We have not been able to observe anything
of the nature of slip-bands in the dark or “ pearlite” areas of steel, but the
correspondence which has been recognised by OsMoND to exist between the. struc-
ture of “pearlite” and that of typical eutectic alloys, taken with facts to be
described below, points to the possibility that “pearlite” may also yield plastically
by slipping.

Slip-bands have also been observed in various specimens of brass and bronze.

The behaviour of eutectic alloys under plastic strain is of special interest, because
these bodies apparently differ so widely in structure from pure metals. Our observa-
tions have been made on the eutectics of lead-tin, copper-silver, and lead-bismuth.
The micro-structure of such eutectics has been described by Osmonp.

Heycock and NevitE; the surface was obtained by casting against glass, and was
