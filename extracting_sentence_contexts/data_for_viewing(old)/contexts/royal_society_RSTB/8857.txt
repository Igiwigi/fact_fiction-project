such as oil [3], the deep sea [4] and permafrost [5-9], all of which have revealed

that microbial DNA can persist in ancient deposits. With respect to humans, the

e-mail: christina warinner@ou.edu study of ancient microorganisms has the potential to reconstruct human
migration and interaction networks [10], and to identify the origins, causes
and evolution of specific infectious diseases [11-14]. Historically, however,
the promise of palaeomicrobiology has been tempered by the uneven quality
of research; the field has been plagued, so to speak, by high profile controver-
sies [15-19], and bold claims made on the basis of modest, incomplete, or
problematic evidence have been met with scepticism, doubt or outright rejec-
tion by the broader ancient DNA community [20,21]. At issue is the fact that
we live in a world dominated by microorganisms, both in absolute numbers
and in species diversity [22-24], and palaeomicrobiology studies have often
failed to account adequately for issues of contamination, authenticity and
sequence specificity in their experimental design. In a review paper as recently
as 2005, the study of ancient bacterial DNA could be accurately summarized as
‘the microbial problem’, with few prospects for resolution [25].

However, recent improvements in contamination control [26], laboratory
workflow design [27,28] and the emergence of powerful new sequencing tech-
nologies [29,30] and bioinformatics tools [31-34] are dramatically altering both
the practice and potential of ancient microbial research. High-throughput next
generation sequencing (NGS) presents a solution to many of the challenges
