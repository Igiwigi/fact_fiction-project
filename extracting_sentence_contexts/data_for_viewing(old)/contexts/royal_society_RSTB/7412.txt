The production of spermatophores in the male Cetorhinus is, as far as our present know-
ledge goes, unique among the elasmobranchs. But in view of the structure of the ampulla
of the ductus deferens where they are formed, it would appear to be desirable to examine
with care the contents of the ampullae in other species. The ampulla is certainly compara-
tively large in Cetorhinus, and its internal structure may be rather more complicated than
in some other species, but its general morphology does not appear to differ fundamentally
from that in other species where, as van den Broek (1932) says, transverse folds of the mucous
membrane of the interior are generally found. It is probable that similar structures serve
similar functions, and scme sort of aggregation of the spermatozoa may well be found to
occur in the ampullae of the ductus deferens in some other elasmobranchs. It may be
suggested that as a consequence of the sperm being enclosed in spermatophores, there will
be less likelihood of loss of sperm by leakage into the water when it passes from the cloaca
to the groove of the clasper during copulation, if, in fact, the clasper groove is the route by
which it is transferred. Conservation may well be an important matter because so large
a quantity, amounting to several gallons, of spermatophores is transferred.

Kidney

The upper part of the kidney is modified as Leydig’s gland in the male, but in the female,
though urinary in function, it is much less developed than the lower part and a number of
its segments are atrophied in the adult. Leydig’s gland has completely lost its urinary
function, any Malpighian corpuscles that may have been present in early life having
atrophied in the adult, and is purely an accessory genital gland. It appears to secrete the
greater part of the fluid in which the spermatozoa are suspended when they reach the
ampulla of the ductus deferens. As pointed out in the section discussing the ampulla of the
