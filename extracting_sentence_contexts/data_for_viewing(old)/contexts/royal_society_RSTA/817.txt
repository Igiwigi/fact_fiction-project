MD simulations of Buta et al. confirmed that the steps are indeed rough and diffuse and that
the step kinetics is isotropic with linear kinetics [34]. It was shown that the steps have a two-
atomic-layer structure. The velocity normal to the {111} direction is much lower than the range of
step velocity found by the same computer experiments. Physically, this can be explained by some
significant ordering of the liquid setting on the terrace in front of the step, due to short-range
order interactions at the interface as illustrated in figure 2. In comparison, the same figure shows
that ordering in the direction normal to the {111} plane occurs over only very few correlation
lengths.

It is assumed that classical nucleation theory can be applied and that neither adjacent clusters
nor steps interact. There is a critical undercooling at which the critical 2D nucleus radius size
is of the same order of magnitude as the terrace length. In fact, evaluating Lstep = Vstep/Vi1i
with equation (4.3) and the critical nucleus radius as R35, = ((Vstep/h)/(AH¢ AT))Tm shows that
R3p/Lstep © 0.15-0.25 at AT ~ 25-40 K. Upon increasing the undercooling, several nuclei may
initiate on the same terrace and their steps interact more and more during lateral growth. If
not rough at equilibrium, the steps themselves become increasingly jagged with higher kink
concentration and larger growth site density. Upon further increasing the undercooling, the step
free energy eventually becomes zero; thus steps can be formed at zero energy cost and the
interface becomes rough. Within Cahn’s theory this occurs at a critical driving force AG** =
a AG* [4]. This critical driving force corresponds to a critical kinetic roughening of dynamical
nature.
