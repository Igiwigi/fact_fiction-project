In a third instance the intermediate leg on the left side had been
cut off quite close to the body, and yet the larva had undergone its change without

legs on the left side had been cut close off, but the basilar joints in these were elongated,
and the insect cast its skin without difficulty. In the fifth specimen, which cast its
skin during the very moment I was examining it, the facts were still more satisfac-

the other instances, had become elongated. Besides this, a portion of the posterior
leg on the same side had been removed at the tibial joint, and this had now been re-
produced with the tarsus and claw.
