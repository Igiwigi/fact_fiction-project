*lWikipedia is a very good example. A pure product of stigmergic
interactions, it is in the top 10 most visited websites in the world
with more than 130000 active contributors per month. Collectively,
Wikipedia’s contributors bring to life a medium that synthesizes in
real time a set of facts and knowledge that would have been imposs-
ible to conceive without a stigmergic medium like the web. See

collective. It has been turned into a theorem by Koppel et al. [72].
