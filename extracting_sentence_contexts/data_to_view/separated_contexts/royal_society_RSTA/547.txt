The value of R, can be estimated indirectly from the values of D,, s = 1,... ,d—1. This
follows from the fact that the sum of the squares of the deviations of the d values y;, y», ..-
from their mean is equal to ae wy

This expression contains d—1 differences 1 unit apart, d—2 differences 2 units apart, etc. Consequently an estimate of R, is given by

WaT {(d—1) D,+ (d—2) D,+...4Dy_4}- If all possible block divisions and all possible differences are used for estimating R, and D,,
the two methods of estimation of R, will give identical results except for end-disturbances.
