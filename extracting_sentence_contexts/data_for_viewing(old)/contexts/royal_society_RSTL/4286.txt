speak) by the extension of the newly-forming zones of the latter around its margin.

* This is by no means a solitary case of the prevalence of monstrosities in particular localities. The collec-
tion of Mr. Bzaw of Scarhorough contains a number of curiously-distorted specimens of the common Planorbis
marginatus, which have all been collected in one brook. Their peculiarities are by no means repetitions of each
other; and I am dispoxed, therefore, to regard them rather as resulting from the influence of external condi-

tions, than as accidental varieties hereditarily propagated.


GENUS ORBITOLITES :—MONSTROSITIES ; ESSENTIAL CHARACTERS. 223

In fact, the manner in which the onter zones of the larger disk envelope the smaller,
precisely corresponds with that in which we have seen the new zones originating from
the uninjured margin of a mutilated specimen, to extend themselves along its frac-
tured edges (© 37.).

V. Of the Essential Characters of Orbitolites, and of its relations to other Types of
Structure.

64. If, now, we seek to determine the essential characters of that type of organi-
zation which is known under the designation Orbitolites, we find them to lie in the
presence of @ series of annuli of sarcode (and of corresponding passages in the sbelly
Yisk) arranged concentrically round a nucleus; each zone in the simpler type con-
Aining but a single annulus, 80 constricted at intervals as to form a series of some-
