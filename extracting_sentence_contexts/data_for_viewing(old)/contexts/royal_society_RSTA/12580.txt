We have examined the values of the coefficients, as calculated by Meyer, from
Porseuriie’s observations, in order to ascertain if they lend any support to the
correction fir fiction-effects outside the tube, as given by Courrre. The coefficients

greater than those determined by the other pair if the correction were operative.
No such difference is «apparent; hence the value of the correction probably falls
within the limite wf the experimental error.
