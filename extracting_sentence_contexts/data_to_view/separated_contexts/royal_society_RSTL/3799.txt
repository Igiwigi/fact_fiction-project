Instead of passing laterally backwards
they are now directed outwards and forwards, to distribute the blood to the anterior
part of the fourth pair of branchize. This altered direction of the vessels is necessary
in order to convey inwards to the hody the blood that is passing forwards along the
subspinal vessel in the tail to be acrated in the posterior branchiz of the abdomen
before it is again transmitted to the heart. That this is the case is proved by the
fact, that a single median trunk (7. 2.) is given off from the under surface of the sub-
Spinal vessel beneath the ganglion in the first caudal segment. This trunk is directed
forwards into the seventh or terminal segment of the abdomen, lying loosely like
those which are directed backwards in the anterior segments. When opposite to the
posterior part of the fourth pair of abdominal branchize it is dilated and divided into
two branches, which together form a dilatation like the anterior ones before they are
directed outwards and are joined by other venous trunks and distributed over the
branchize.
