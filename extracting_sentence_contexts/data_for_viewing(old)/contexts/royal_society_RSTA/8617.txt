been going on for about two or three seconds was that of a series of thin equi-distant
planes of coloured fluid spaced at a distance equal to the thickness of the space between
the cylinders. In fact, after the first few seconds the motion appeared to get to a steady
state in which it was impossible to distinguish the outward-flowing films from the
inward-flowing ones, though all of them were extremely sharply defined.

Photographs of the Stream Lines.

Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining satisfactory photographs of the
phenomenon because when eosin was used instead of fluorescene a more concentrated
solution was necessary ; and it was found difficult to make up this solution so that its .
density remained the same as that of water when it was surrounded by water. It
frequently happened in fact that the coloured liquid formed two columns, one going up
and the other down, when strong eosin solution mixed with alcohol was used. In
spite of this and other difficulties some fairly good photographs were obtained.

Fig. 9, Plate 4, shows the appearance of the films shortly after their formation.
This photograph shows a motion which is not so regular as most of those observed, but
it has the advantage that one can see some of the intermediate stream lines marked
out by some colouring matter which had got away from the surface of the inner cylinder
before the instabilityâ€™set in. A particularly noticeable one occurs in the third partition
from the bottom on the left-hand side. The photographs were taken with an ordinary
magnesium flashlight apparatus.
