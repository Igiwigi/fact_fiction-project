In surface-observation we have derived great advantage from the use of the Braus-
Driiner binocular stereoscopic microscope. It is hardly too much to say that the use

an object, im toto. In a few cases it has been possible to utilise the resources of the
same instrument for stereoscopic photography ; but when used in camera form, and
necessarily without eye-piece, its magnifying power is very limited.

We have made extensive use of the resources of photography, both for the purpose
of graphically recording the progressive results of our work, and also, as the plates
accompanying this memoir show, of final illustration. We are not unconscious of the
fact that in so doing we sacrifice the opportunity, which the ordinary drawing affords,
of rendering certain points diagrammatically clear. The drawings that we have
thought it advisable to reproduce as plates will show that our decision to trust
mainly to photographic reproduction was in no way forced upon us. But not a few

demand the utmost degree of objectivity in their presentation. For this we have
been content to rely upon the modern methods of photographic reproduction from our
