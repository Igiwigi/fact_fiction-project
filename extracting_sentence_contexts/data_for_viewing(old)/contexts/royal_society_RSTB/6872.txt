the stretched portion of the lower central chromatid measures about 12 mm., whilst
the corresponding distance on the V-shaped chromosome to the left is only about
7mm. A stretching of over 70% is thus demonstrated. The after-effects of such
stretching are well seen on the left of fig. 54, Plate 18, in which a neck-like thin place
is clearly visible in each affected chromatid. This appearance becomes exaggerated
in polyploids, presumably owing to the enhanced difficulty of disjunction in multi-
valent groups. A very clear single chromosome from a triploid treated for spiral
structure is given in fig. 76, Plate 19, and an extreme case of stretching appears in the
tetraploid cell of fig. 79, Plate 19. Assuming that in this, as in the others, the affected
regions represent about one coil, a stretching of the order of 200% is shown by this
specimen (see Appendix IT).

The fact that ‘‘necks”’ are still conspicuous objects at late anaphase, indicates that
recovery from stretching is a slower and more difficult process than recovery from
straightening. Recovery has certainly occurred in fig. 76 (see Appendix IT), but it
can never be completely followed owing to the onset of the diffuse stage of interkinesis.
Ina normal plant, however, no trace of the disturbance can be detected in the prophase
of the next division, and though a case as extreme as that of fig. 79 may perhaps express
permanent damage to the cell, such damage must be quite exceptional for reproduction

in the tetraploid is not impeded. Now recovery would not be expected to occur at all
if the basis of mechanical extension of this order were molecular slipping. The only
