T add the general result for equal rows which has now been established

GF (1; a")
(+n)... ([+a+n—1) \ (l+n~1)... ([+a4+n—2) (t+1).. -(I+a)
~  (n)... (a+-n—1) (n—1)...(a+n—2) 7°" (1) ... (a)

Art. 30, I recall that, in Part V., the formula was given
GF (1; a,b, c,d, ...) = L,GF (1; Sa)+L,GF (I-1; Sa)+...+L,GF (J—p; Sa),

wherein L, is the sub-lattice function of order s derived from the lattice whose
specification is (abed...). So far it has not been feasible to directly determine an
expression for L,, but as we now know the expression for GF (/; a, b,¢,d,...) it is
possible to find expressions for L,, L:, L,, ..., by giving / the values 1, 2, 3,..., in
succession in the resulting identity. One interesting result was, however, directly
determined, viz. :—

L,(~ ; a, b)

=a wv (8 —s+1) — (a—1) (b—s+1)... (b) af; —g)4-g°7*t! (9
(1)... (8) Gj abi eee ee

but I do not give the proof of it at present, as the subject of the sub-lattice functions
has not yet been worked out, and they are, in fact, no longer necessary for this part

of the general investigation. Art. 31. Valuable information, concerning line or one-dimensional partitions, is
furnished by putting J = 1 in the general formula.
