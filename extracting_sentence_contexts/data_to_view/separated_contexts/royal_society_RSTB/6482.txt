extent. An independent operculum was attached to the hinder border of each visceral
arch from the mandibular to the fourth branchial. The backward extension of the
palato-quadrate and Meckelâ€™s cartilages, necessary for the formation of the mouth and
the attachment of a powerful jaw musculature, brought the hinder end of these
elements over the lateral surface of the hyoidean arch and enabled the mandibular
operculum to extend backward for a great distance, until in fact its ventral part came
to rest on the front margin of the lower part of the shoulder girdle. This operculum,
however, left uncovered a large triangular area above its dorsal margin. It is necessary
for the functioning of the gill apparatus that the gill slits so left exposed should be
provided with an opercular apparatus.
