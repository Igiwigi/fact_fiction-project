THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 811

rotationally elastic, or it may combine these two properties ; there is no* other

As to the intrinsic nature of the rotational elasticity of the free ther, although it
san important corroboration of our faith in the possibility of such a medium to have
ord Krivin’s gyrostatic scheme by which it might be theoretically built up out of
ordinary matter, yet we ought not to infer that a rotational free ether is necessarily
discrete or structural in its ultimate parts, instead of being a continuum. As a
matter of history, the precisely similar argument has been applied to ordinary solids ;
the fact that deformation induces stress has been taken, apparently with equal force,
s evidence of molecular structure in any medium which exhibits ordinary elasticity.
Tt is necessary to put some limit to these successive refinements; there must be a
final type of medium which we accept as fundamental without further analysis of its
properties of elasticity or inertia: and there seems to be no adequate reason why we
hould prefer for this medium the coustitution of an elastic solid rather than a consti-
tution which distortion does not affect,—perhaps there is just the reverse.

velocities are appreciable compared with the velocity of radiation, this will be a
function of their relative positions alone. The kinetic energy is that of the fluid
circulation of the medium, which will under the same circumstances be a quadratic
