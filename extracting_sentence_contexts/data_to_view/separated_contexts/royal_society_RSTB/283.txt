Fig. 22 (Plate 8) is an oblique transverse section of a cylindric rootlet of another
description ; at a a few vessels or tracheids occupy the centre of a mass of delicate
elongated cells, either representing phlo√©m or procambium. The middle cortex, b,
consists of a loose form of parenchyma, enclosing numerous irregular large lacune of
the type so common in the roots of the Nymphex. Of course, this indicates no
systematic relation with the latter plants, beyond the fact that our fossil root most
probably belonged to some aquatic or semi-aquatic type. At c is a compact quasi-
epidermal investing layer of cells. The specimen, which is from one of the Oldham
nodules, may be designated Rhizonium reticulatum.
