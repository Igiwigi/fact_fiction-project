E. H. LOVE ON THE INTEGRATION OF THE

such factors as ,/(m? + nÂ°) and $(1-+ 7) are of no importance in the ordinary appli-
cations of expressions for the law of disturbance in secondary waves, and that, in
fact, the enquiry after such a law involves a certain ambiguity. In the above deduc-
tion of such a law, we have used the general formule involving sources of two types ;
if we could have used formule involving sources of one type only, the result would
probably have been different ; this is the origin of the ambiguity referred to by Lord
RAYLEIGH.

23. There is another difficulty attending the deduction of a law of disturbance in
secondary waves from formule applicable to the propagation of a system of plane
waves, viz.: that integrals such as (45) taken over an infinite plane are not con-
vergent.
