Comparison between the microscopic view of the PS-S spall recovered after a test performed at 7500s~' and
numerical results given by the DFH model in terms of damage and crack density field.

they were initiated after the spalling damage and they had no influence on the spalling process. a)
The damaged zone located in the bottom of the specimen has been initiated after the main 13
spalling process. These cracks are due to interaction between release waves coming from the S
spall zone and secondary loadings due to the sinusoidal form of the current discharge. This is 78
confirmed by the fact that fewer cracks are initiated in the damaged zone located in the bottom iw
of the specimen. The main damaged zone located between the two horizontal dashed lines is :
about 1.55mm in width. Good correlation between the size and the location of the damaged : a
zone obtained experimentally and the damage field obtained numerically can be observed. : a
Moreover, due to the low loading rate, this spall zone obtained by numerical simulation is .
not fully damaged.
