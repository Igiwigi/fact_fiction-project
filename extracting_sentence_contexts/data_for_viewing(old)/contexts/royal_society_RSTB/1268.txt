iS Theoretical Consideration of the Results.

a

Perhaps the most interesting point of detail in the results thus stated is that the
rchesporium of Equisetum is not, strictly speaking, of hypodermal origin, but that
n addition is made to the first hypodermal archesporial cell by further segmentation
f the superficial one. In this, it will be subsequently shown that Equisetum does
ot stand alone. In Jsoetes, also, and in Selaginella, and, in rare cases, in Lycopodium,
imilar additions appear to be made to the sporogenous cells first laid down ; the cells
‘hus added are shown in Equisetum to develop into spores, and are thus archesporial
in their character. It will be seen that these facts will affect the generalization of
GOEBEL, as given in the paper in which he introduced the idea of the archesporium
(‘ Bot. Zeit. 1880, p. 569). He there states “that in all the Vascular Cryptogams
