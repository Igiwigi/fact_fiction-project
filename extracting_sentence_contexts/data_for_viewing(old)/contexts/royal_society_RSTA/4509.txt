underlying symbolic nature) constitutes a significant advance in the study of nonlinear dynamical
systems [31]. The method provides univocal prescription for ordinary, global entropic quantifiers
of the Shannon kind. However, as was shown by Rosso and co-workers [22,23], ambiguities arise
in applying the Bandt and Pompe technique with reference to the permutation of ordinal patterns.
This happens if one wishes to employ the Bandt and Pompe probability density to construct local
entropic quantifiers, like the FIM, which would characterize TS generated by nonlinear dynamical
systems.

The local sensitivity of the FIM for discrete PDFs is reflected in the fact that the specific ‘i-
ordering’ of the discrete values p; must be seriously taken into account in evaluating the sum
in equation (2.4). The pertinent numerator can be regarded as a kind of ‘distance’ between two
contiguous probabilities. Thus, a different ordering of the pertinent summands would lead to a
different Fisher information value. In fact, if we have a discrete PDF given by P = {pj,i=1,...,N},
we will have N! possibilities for the i-ordering.


The question is, which is the arrangement that one could regard as the ‘proper’ ordering? The
answer is straightforward in some cases, the histogram-based PDF constituting a conspicuous
example. For such a procedure, one first divides the interval [a,b] (with a and b the
minimum and maximum amplitude values in the TS) into a finite number of non-overlapping
subintervals (bins). Thus, the division procedure of the interval [a,b] provides the natural
order sequence for the evaluation of the PDF gradient involved in the FIM. In this paper,
we chose for the Bandt-Pompe PDF the lexicographic ordering given by the algorithm of
