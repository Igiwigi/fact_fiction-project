transfer of the control force to the hub without the generation of a reaction force in the flapwise
direction of the blade. In fact, the active elements produce forces that are external to the support
structure and hence nullify the forces in the flapwise direction (e.g. the net flapwise load at
joints A or B is identically zero). Hence, mechanistically, this eliminates any flapwise reaction
forces for the support structure if the algebraic condition ATo(t) sin(go) = AT) (t) sin(g1) shown
in figure 3 is met. The forces T,T},... are static prestressing forces in the cable.
