However, once more, crucially this evidence is only in fact
able to support the model when combined with terrestrial experiments, and so is naturally
underpinned by uniformity principles. We have made a point so far of the fact that obtaining
direct photonic observational evidence of the nuclear reactions in stellar cores is not possible. However, on account of the fact that the neutrinos produced in the nuclear reactions in the
stellar core interact so weakly with matter, it is highly probable for them to escape the star
without interacting, allowing us to detect on Earth stellar neutrinos directly from the stellar
core. The neutrino flux from the reactions in the interior of the Sun can be observed at Earth and
compared to the theoretical value of neutrino flux deduced from the theorized energy production
process in the solar core. Fascinatingly, the quantitative correspondence desired did not obtain
when the first solar neutrino detection experiments where conducted [58].
