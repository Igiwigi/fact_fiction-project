It appeared, therefore, that it would be desirable to settle the question, whether or
not that vast storehouse of Nitrogen, the atmosphere, in which the vegetation which
covers the Tarth's surface is scen to live and flourish, be of any measurable avail to the
growing plant, 80 far as its free or uncombined Nitrogen is concerned. The settlement of this question (whether affirmatively or negatively) would at any
rate indicate the degree of importance to be attached to the remaining open points of
inquiry. Indeed, were it found that plants generally, or some of those we cultivate
more than others, were able to fix Nitrogen from that presented to them 1a the free or
uncombined form, we should, in this fact, have a clue to the explanation of much that

is yet clouded in obscurity in connexion with the chemical phenomena of Agricultural
production. We should establish for vegetation, the attribute of effecting chemical
combinations with an element at once the most reluctant to associate itself with other
bodies in obedience to laboratory processes and at the same time apt to rid itself of
connexions once formed in the most violent manner—as the explosive character of many
Nitrogen compounds forcibly illustrates. We should further be able, much more satis-
factorily than we are at present, to account—by processes established to be going 0
under our own observation—for the actually large total amount of combined Nitrogen
which we know to exist and to circulate, in land and water, in animal and vegetable
life, and in the atmosphere.
