Though the facts
noted do not in any way demonstrate that such a shifting has taken place along any
sequence of descent, they at least countenance the suggestion that there probably has
been a change from the median to the lateral dehiscence. Taking now the position of the annulus as a whole, we see that it is oblique in the
Schizeeacer, Gleicheniacere, Hymenophyllacex, &c., while it is usually described as

& vertical in most of the Polypodiacese. The facts I have described above show that

“the one type graduates by almost imperceptible steps into the other, while even

Sin those which are described as having a vertical annulus, details may often be traced

2 which compare with those where it is oblique ; we shall not, therefore, look upon the

“A two types as essentially distinct. S If the development be compared, it will be seen that the annulus is not specially

Slocalised in any one of those segments which appear with such constancy in the early

Bstages of the Leptosporangiate sporangium, PRranrL* showed that in Schizeu the

sowhole annulus is derived from the cap-segment, and this is probably the case for

‘& the rest of the Schizzecess. He also showed how the oblique annulus of Z'richomancs

B is derived only in part from the cap-segment, while the segments I. and IIT. contri-
bute the basal portion of it, but that segment IT., which lies constantly on the side

-B next to the apex of the receptacle, contributes only to the stalk, and to the thin-

% walled region of the wall which we have styled the “central” facet Kny{ and

=MUtter§ have given a detailed description of the development of the sporangium in

= Nephrodium Filix-mas, from which it appears that here again segment IT. takes

Eno part in the formation of the annulus, but contributes only to the stalk, and to the

“= “central” face of the sporangium ; the annulus is entirely derived from the products

g of the cap-cell, and of the segments I. and III.
