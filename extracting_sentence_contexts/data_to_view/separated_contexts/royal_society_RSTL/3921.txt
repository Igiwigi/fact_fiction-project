It is however a very
curious, and I believe even important fact in its consequences, to obtain the induced

contraction through the skin of the muscles of the inducing frog. The experiment
never fails of s8nccess, whether the inducing contraction be excited by the electric
current, or by any stimulus applied to the lumbar plexuses of the inducing frog. Having thus described a long series of facts relative to the cireumstances that in-
tervene in producing, in modifying, and in destroying the phenomenon of induced
contraction, it might be believed that with the aid of these I might ascend to the
physical theory of the phenomenon.


314 PROFESSOR MATTEUCCI'S ELECTRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCHES. Unfortunately I am rather doubtful of it, and in this uncertainty I again beg the
reader to follow me in the discussions that I shall be compelled to make upon the
different hypotheses that may be imagined by which to interpret the phenomenon of
induced contraction. I.
