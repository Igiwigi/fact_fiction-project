We will now proceed to calculate such of the minors of A as will give us results
beyond those obtained for two correlated organs.*

We require the correlation of o, and 7, and of 7» and 7,;. Taking o, and 7., we must strike out in (xxxii.), as we have taken only three
organs, the 4th, 7th, 9th, and LOth rows and columns straight off, and for the required
minor the Ist row and the 8th column. We have then for the minor M (0, 7;),

To reduce this expression take the third row multiplied by 7, from the first, and
the fifth row multiplied by 7; from the first. ‘Then take the fourth row multiplied
by 75 from the second, and the fifth row multiplied by 7, from the second, then
remembering that

* As a matter of fact all the minors were worked out and the results of (xv.) to (xviii.) thus veritied,
