In this case, when n = 2, the two
quantities e”’, e” are inverses and c, = —c,. In this case the equation

|Q5"(u)—p| = 0

gives at once the value of coscw, This appears, however, a less advantageous way
of determining ¢,, c, than that explained above, as requiring greater approximation
in the calculation of Q,'(w), as will be seen in examples. The fact that ¢,, ¢, are equal and of opposite signs is a particular case of a
well-known theorem for the variational equations arising in the general dynamical
case, which is proved by Porncart (‘ Méth. Nouy.,’ L, 193). The following proof,
though longer, appears more fundamental in character, The general dynamical
