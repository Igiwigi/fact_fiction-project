From the calculations given in the first of these papers, it is clear that the first step in
planning a decisive laboratory experiment with a rotating body must be the development
_of a method of detecting a static magnetic field of the order of 10-9 to 107!°G, so allowing
a field of 10~° to 10~° G to be measured with significant accuracy. In this paper I shall describe in detail the theoretical and experimental design of a very
‘<sensitive astatic magnetometer, and I shall show that the desired sensitivity can be attained.
© As the rotating body experiment was clearly likely to be one of great difficulty, another
‘and much simpler experiment was planned first. This was to test whether a small magnetic
‘field exists near a massive body at rest relative to the measuring instrument, due to the fact
‘Bhat both test body and measuring instrument are rotating with the earth. Such an effect
Qvould be a probable consequence of a particular form of the Schuster-Wilson hypothesis.
‘This is that a massive body in rotation be considered the seat of a virtual current. Recent
theoretical discussions of this hypothesis, have been given by Blackett (1949 b), Papapatrou
1950) and Luschak (1951).
