ing power of sticks to collect insects [82], the water retention
power of moss to collect water [83], the hooking power of
curved twigs to extract worms [84], and so on.

What these behaviours seem to have in common, how-
ever, is that (i) they rely on natural phenomena whose
effects can be observed from manipulating readily available
materials, and (ii) they have an immediate effect on the pro-
vision of resources. In that regard, they rely on natural
phenomena similar to those exploited by early hominins:
rocks were used to pound bones open for marrow, flakes
(that might initially have been by-products of other activities
[27]) were used for flesh removal, and so on. The fact that the
natural phenomena exploited by non-human animals
can result from the manipulation of readily available material
and provide immediate benefits suggests that simple
associative learning mechanisms may account for their incor-
poration into individualsâ€™ behavioural repertoires. For
instance, an individual might accidentally crack a nut open
by playing around with rocks. This lucky accident will deli-
ver a reward to the individual and act as a reinforcer that
will make the behaviour more likely to be repeated in the
future [85]. This indicates that harnessing some natural
phenomena may result from widespread cognitive abilities.
