limits of error show that this is not the case, but that the difference is real. The
limit of S, is 1771 higher, or 24489°214+3°84, Another 17°1 higher would give
24506°31+3°8. In view of the actual limit 24500+7°5, we might provisionally fix it
at 24506. The second line of the doublet would then be 24523°1. An additional
17°1 lands us on 24540°1, which is close to the 24550+ ? of the two series considered
above. These results can hardly be fortuitous. The limit of 8, is generated by the
P, series, being VP, (1); the limit of S, is found from this by deducting the atomic
weight term, 2W, from the » of P,(1). The limits will therefore be generated by
writing p» = ‘148678—2pW in P,, where p has integral values from 0 to 5, and
possibly to 7 (LENaRD’s series), both inclusive. Rirz has given the doublet series
just considered as VP, (1)—VP, (m),,.VP.(1)—VP, (m). We have seen, however, that
this cannot be the case.* Moreover, VP, (1)—VP, (m) for m= 1 would give an
infinite time of vibration, and would suggest instability. In fact, the configuration
giving this series, containing one very long period, is apparently very slightly stable.
It is possible that the VP, (m) ought also to be slightly different, but the observations
are far too inexact to settle this.

Again, Rypperre’s tables show that 7418 8., 5100 Lx., 4472 8. have denominators
about 2°845, 3°845, and 4°845, with a limit 27026. Working from this they satisfy
the formula

n = 2703845 —N/(m+ ‘8358 +m x 0148).

27034 is not far from the value of VD (1), which is 27282+52. But the interest
of this allocation lies chiefly in this, that its » is of the form we should expect for the
