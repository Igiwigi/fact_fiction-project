306 E. J. W. BARRINGTON ON THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF

8—Tue INTERPRETATION OF THE Mip-cut DiveRTICULUM

The commonly implied interpretation of the mid-gut diverticulum of Amphioxus
as homologous with the liver of the Craniates appears to be based upon the existence
of an ‘hepatic portal system”’, as originally described by Mttier (1844), and the
resemblance in the mode of development of the two organs, as described by HAMMAR
(1898). The latter’s argument depends upon nothing more than the fact that the
diverticulum develops as a ventral groove of the mid-gut, the opening of the groove
being then narrowed and the groove itself transformed into the tubular diverticulum
by the backward movement of its anterior edge. It is difficult to see that this fact
carries any weight at all without a great deal of confirmatory evidence. Characteristic
functions of the Craniate liver are the storage of glycogen and to a less extent of fat,
the regulation of urea content, and the excretion of bile pigments. With regard to the
existence of the latter in Amphioxus it is impossible to state anything definite in the
absence of experimental evidence, but their occurrence is unlikely in view of the fact
that the blood is colourless. Similarly, there appears to be no evidence with regard
to the nitrogen metabolism, and this aspect of the problem clearly demands investiga-
tion. However, even if the diverticulum were shown to be concerned in the regulation
of urea, this would not be conclusive, for there is reason to believe that in Scyllium
