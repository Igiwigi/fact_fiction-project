Following the
progress of these two crests down the page, we find them gradually approaching
each other and wearing out the depression in advance of them, until between VIII.
and IX. o'clock the hollow has vanished ; at X. o'clock there is a decided convexity
of surface, which gradually increases until at XI. o'clock, Plan 3, the crest has
attained its zenith : the combined wave is perfected, and it is high water at Dover. If now we follow the wave down the same page, Plan 3, as the tide falls, we find
the crest to become more ohlate, and finally, to be obliterated without there being
any material progress of the wave in either direction. In fact, the wave on this
section appears to descend nearly perpendicularly, and the progress of the derivative
waves to be 80 far destroyed that we can scarcely trace any indication of their ad-
vance. On the contrary, we see a new wave on each side preparing to roll up the
Channel to renew the wave thus clearly common to both, So far then we perceive,
from these data, that the wave in the Strait of Dover is due to the combined action
of two waves derived from the parent or Atlantic wave, and which advance from
opposite quarters. These waves, it may be seen, are materially different in their
dimensions and rate of travelling from those of the oceanic wave from which they
are derived.
