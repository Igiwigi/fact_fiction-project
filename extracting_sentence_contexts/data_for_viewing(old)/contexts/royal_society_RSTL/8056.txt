Z openings, and the numerous ova of small size, remind us unmistakably of similar

The only remaining absolute characters by which we can distinguish the Dipnoi
.2 from the Ganoids and Chondropterygians are the position of the nostrils within the
Z mouth, the dentition consisting of two pairs of molars and one of vomerine teeth, and
Sthe lobate fins or paddles, snpported by an arial cartilaginous skeleton.
SZ These three points cannot be considered to constitute the characters of a subclass
[5 cqupralent to Teleostei, Ganoidei, &c.; and therefore the Dipnoi are better united with
E the Ganoids.
E But it appears to me that also the Ganoids and Chondropterygians are much more
= closely allied to each other than either of them to the Teleosteans. It would be beyond
S the limits of this paper to enter into all the various points of organization which have to
S be considered with regard to this question. But I may urge, as the most important fact
Zin favour of this view, the treble partition of the heart of all these fighesâ€”the bulbus aorte

Separated from the pulsating heart by the (almost always) double valve. A heart with
a true cons arteriosus is always accompanied by a spiral valve of the intestine (which
only exceptionally, as in Lepidosteus, remains in a rudimentary condition), and by non-

surprising.
