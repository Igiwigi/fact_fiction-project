In figure 4, the added complexity of pressure changes is involved, this time
for a blend of PS with polybutadiene (PB), which exhibits a UCST for which
he pressure dependence has been measured (Tripathi 1979). Once again, the
pure component characteristic parameters are obtained by fitting PVT data,
while g derives from a fit to a single datum point (circled in figure 4). One point
o note is that the transportability of characteristic parameters for a polymeric
melt depends on the molecular weight range of interest (i.e. oligomeric versus
polymeric regimes). Parameters determined from data on low molecular weights,
say of order 10? gmol~!, will not as successfully describe behaviour of melts
1aving molecular weights two or three orders of magnitude greater. Thus, the
characteristic parameters for the PS samples associated with figure 4 are different
irom those used in predicting the results of figure 3. The fact that a single set of
parameters (within the oligomeric regime) is able to capture the UCST shift for
