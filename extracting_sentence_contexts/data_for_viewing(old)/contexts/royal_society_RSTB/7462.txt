As far as the control of Lucilia and C. chloropyga populations is concerned, phase 2 above
is the important one. During this period a drastic reduction takes place as a direct result
of attack by C. albiceps and not of competition in the true sense.

VII. SoME FACTS CONCERNING CHRYSOMYIA MARGINALIS

It was not possible to conduct experiments with C. marginalis on the extended scale used
with the other species. Because of this, the data available for C. marginalis were not con-
sidered when these flies were discussed. Before examining the practical aspects of the
results obtained, it seems worth while to give the facts that are known. These throw some
light on the role that is played by C. marginalis on the carcass. To do this is the more desirable,
since this species has been chosen, on very flimsy evidence, as the main factor controlling
populations of primary flies on carrion in the field (see Hepburn 19436, Ménnig 1942,
Ménnig & Cilliers 1944). Furthermore, recommendations for control measures which
involve special treatment of carcasses have been based upon this opinion (Ménnig 1942).
