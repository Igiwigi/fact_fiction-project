Figure 5. NT and NG genes up-regulated upon HU-induced loss of neurogenesis. (a) Scheme depicting the FACS-assisted production of cell-type-specific RNA-seq
quantitative transcriptomics, ectodermal epithelial from Ecto-GFP [29], endodermal epithelial from Endo-GFP [30] and interstitial from Cnnos1-GFP [31]. (b,c) Ternary
plots showing the results of the quantitative cross analysis of the cell-type RNA-seq datasets in homeostatic Hv_AEFP (position within the plot) and the HU-treated
RNA-seq datasets performed on Hv_Sf1 to detect neurogenic (b) and neurotransmission (c) genes up-regulated at least twofold 7 days post HU exposure. Circle
surfaces are proportional to the number of reads (see electronic supplementary material, table $1, for absolute read numbers). The fold change (FC) HU over control
is given by the colour code and indicated next to gene names. (d,e) Kinetics of HU-induced up-regulation of 34 genes presumably involved in neurogenesis (d),
through transcriptional regulation (Dix, Dix1, DMBX1, Ets1, KLF11, LMX1A, ZNF436, Gli3, SHOX) and/or Wnt signalling inhibition (Dkk1/2/4A, Dkk1/2/4Q), or neuro-
transmission (e), possibly neuropeptidic (NaC7, FMRFRL), epitheliopeptidic (Arminin 1b-1, Arminin 01798, PW peptide pre-prohormone), dopaminergic (DOPA
decarboxylase 12—DDCL2), cholinergic (CHRNa1), or uncharacterized (GPRAQ.6, GPRBO.1, GPRB3.1, GPRB4.1, GPRB7.2) (e). All values at time 0 (before treatment
initiation) were extrapolated to be equal to 0. (f,g) RNA-seq profiles of 9 NG and 15 NT genes up-regulated upon loss of neurogenesis. Three types of information
are presented: spatial (see figure 1b), cell-type distribution (see a) and responses to Col/HS/HU treatment (see figure 2a). y-axis: thousands of mapped reads.
