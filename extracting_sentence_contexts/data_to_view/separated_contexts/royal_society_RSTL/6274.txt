To the results of his experi-
ments I shall presently have to refer in detail. Finally, J. Le CoNTE®, in his interesting memoir on the influence of solar light on
combustion, expresses the following opinion, with reference to the obseryations of Davy,
TrxIGer, and MITCHELL: © Thus a variety of well-established facts concur in fortifying
the conclusions to which we are led by &@ priori reasoning, namely, that the proces
of combustion is retarded by diminution of the density of the air, whilst it is accelerated
by its condensation.” M. Lz Conte did not himself make any experiments on the
influence of atmospheric pressure on the rate of combustion. Such was the state of knowledge and opinion regarding the influence of atmospherie
pressure upon the heat and light of combustion, when in the autumn of 1859, whilst
accompanying Dr.
