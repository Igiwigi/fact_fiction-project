Nevertheless, we have to bear in mind that the microstructure
of these gels is a network in which the knots are occupied by magnetic particles linked to the
polymer chains. In consequence, at very low strain a part of the net will be relaxed (lower G’) and
then, as the network is progressively stretched more and more branches withstand the mechanical
stress. This fact, at the macroscopic scale, implies a progressive increase in G’. Obviously, when
the maximum stretching is exceeded the break point is reached. On the other hand, when an external field was applied, the magnetic particles located in
the knots of the net were brought closer and the elastic modulus should increase, leading to
a significant MR effect in the ferrogels.
