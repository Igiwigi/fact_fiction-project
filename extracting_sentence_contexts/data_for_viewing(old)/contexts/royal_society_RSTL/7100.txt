Z IU=26, VU=>2; H, OU=3H,

E we find the before-mentioned expression of d7U.

A 60. Operating with the two sides of the same equation on a function H of the order
m', we find
m(m—1)UFH—(m—1)%H= mw(m'—1)ÞH
—2(m—1)IVH
+ LTH
and in particular if H is the Hessian, then writing m'=39—6, and putting U=0, we
find the before-mentioned expression for DH.
61. But we may also from the general identical equation deduce the expression for
(0H). In fact taking H a function of the degree m' and writing

we have
m(m—1)U(e, . .X0.H—»d,H, 1-,H—d.H, 2d,H—pd HY — (m—1)(dH)*

and if IT be the Hessian, then writing 77=3m—6 and putting alsv U=0, we find the
before-mentioned expression for (0H)?
