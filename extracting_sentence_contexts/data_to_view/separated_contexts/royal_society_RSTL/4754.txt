The plastic nature of the viscous lavas of Vesuvius and Etna is such as well might
obliterate any internal traces of rents due to differential velocity, which, in the mass,
are speedily closed and reunited as in a stream of treacle, or in the plaster models
before explained, where the interior is homogeneous and the Superficial coating above
is permanently dislocated. In lavas the indescribable ruggedness of the surface very generally prevents any
record of the gentler play of forces. The following facts appear to me quite conclu-
sive as to the manner in which a mass partially solidified, yet moving as a fluid, is
torn up by the interior forces which act upon it.

1. At Vesuvius, the Fossa della Fetrana between the Hermitage and Monte Somma,
is a valley lined with the lava of 1751. I here observed that the lava was in some
places detached from the wall of the valley, leaving a cavity on the sheltered side of

a projecting elbow of rock, just as a glacier does in similar circumstances, showing
the considerable consistence which the lava Pos8esscd.

| | In the upper part of this Fossa the lava has a distinct linear structure where broken,
in shells parallel to the sides, whose thickness varies from one-third of an inch upwards.
| The position of these surfaces of dislocation is indicated (for illustration) in figure 5
