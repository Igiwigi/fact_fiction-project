the lower lamellz, constituting the exterior of the viscus.

On examining a borizontal preparation of a fragment of the same viscus, we see
that the undulations of the lamella, fig. 30 c, produce the appearance exhibited by
fig. 29. Numerous parallel lines enclose corresponding spaces, about the 555th of
an inch in width, which circumscribe the viscus at right angles to its longer diameter.
The lacunze, fig. 29 a, which are arranged in corresponding rows, are alternately
above and below the lamella, their irregularly projecting canaliculi, 29 b, giving
them the aspect of Hebrew or Arabic characters. On making a horizontal section
amongst the lower lamellze, 30 Â«a, we find that the numerous lacunz are of the com-
mon ichthyal type, only they are more than usually crowded together, as well as
anastomose more freely through their spider-like lacunze. No canals of any kind
pass through the tissue. These facts of course do away with all probability of this ano-
malous viscus having been a stomach ; according to Dr. ManTELL, to whom we are
indebted for the discovery of this singular creature, the broad anterior extremity of
the cylinder is always open, and situated opposite the posterior margin of the oper-
cular bone, whilst its caudal termination is as invariably closed.

I am disposed to believe that it has been an organ fulfilling the functions of an
air-bladder. Its osseous structure would render it capable of resisting a considerable
amount of pressure, and if its patulous extremity has been closed up by an elastic
membranous appendage, capable of acting as a valve, this would enable the creature
to regulate its buoyancy by increasing or diminishing the compression of the con-
tained air, and thus facilitate its movements in either shallow water or at great
depths. Except in cases of diseased ossification, the existence of an internal thoracic
