When the diameter of the test has increased to 7 mm., the up-growths on either side of
the ambulacrum fuse to form a complete arch.

(c) The Plates in the Buccal Membrane.

At metamorphosis only the ten large buccal plates are present. These are practically
equal in size, but when the five primary buccal tube-feet appear soon afterwards in the
series Ib, IIb, 11a, IVb, Va they become markedly “ heterotropic.” This is due to
the fact that the plates through which the primary buccal tube-feet pass increase

rapidly in size and assume a different shape from the others. Small buccal plates next
make their appearance both external to and internal to the ring of large buccal plates.
At first these plates appear (externally) only opposite the inter-ambulacra.

The secondary buccal tube-feet come from the corona and enter the smaller series of
large buccal pates (the Ia, Ila, I1Ib, 1Va, Vb series), part of the calcite being
resorbed to accommodate them. Then these plates soon assume the size and shape of
those in the other series. The two series of buccal tube-feet differ from each other
