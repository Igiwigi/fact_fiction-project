extremely thin and flexible on the short sides. This allows the dilation of the
posterior pharynx at the time of feeding.

The epithelium (fig. 21, ¢./.) is very much flattened and there are no cellular
limits. Its internal and external surfaces are smooth and straight. The nuclei
are larger than those of the epithelia of the preceding two sections. They are
sparsely scattered and are flattened so that they appear elongate-oval in longitudinal
sections. The basement membrane is absent. The intrinsic musculature consists
of powerful circular muscles (fig. 18, c.m.). The fibres of these circular muscles
give branches anteriorly and posteriorly in the middle of the dorsal side so as to
constitute a dorsal longitudinal muscle (figs. 17, 18, d.l.p.). The absence of well-
developed longitudinal musculature in both the sections of the pharynx is associated
with the fact that the function of the longitudinal muscles is taken up by their
dilators. Harms (1912, p. 187) failed to find any longitudinal muscle in this section
of the stomodaeum. The circular muscles at its junction with the crop are more
closely placed and powerful.

Contrary to the usual practice of previous workers on the flea larva, I have
designated this section of the stomodaeum the posterior pharynx, a name usually
adopted for a similar section of the stomodaeum in Coleoptera and Orthoptera
(Snoperass, 1935, p. 285). Owing to an abundant supply of the cranial dilators
to this section of the stomodaeum, it is a mistake to call it the oesophagus, which
name, as pointed out by SNopeGrRass (1935, p. 352), is confined to “ the narrow part
of the stomodaeum following the pharynx that is not differentiated for purposes other
than that of food conduction”’. There is no section of the stomodaeum of the flea
