14 and 2F,
whilst in others it is developed into irregular tubercles, fig. 2g. From the latter
representation, we See the way in which these tubercles of ganoin are formed. They
are, in fact, prolongations of the upturned edges of the bony lamelle, running
towards the centre of the scale, but only covering small portions of the surface,
instead of uniformly extending over the whole, as we shall afterwards find to be the
case in Lepidotus and other fossil forms. We see from this, that each lamella of the
ganoin was formed contemporaneously with that of the bone from which it springs;
each lamina, shown in the drawing, consists of a number of more minute lamellee,
as has been already observed in reference to the osseous portions. With the excep-
tion of the tubes, of which the orifices have been already alluded to as perforating its
laminz, I bave not been able to detect any other microscopic structure than these
lamellz in the ganoin.
