Recyarp* trephined the skull of two rabbits and suspended the animals in the
vertical posture, with the head up. The brain became anemic and collapsed, and in
less than two minutes convulsions supervened and the animals died. SavaTHet proved that this rapid death only takes place when the rabbits have
lost a great deal of blood, a fact which had previously been determined by MarsHALL
Haut on dogs. Satarut, nevertheless, found that suspension, with the head up,
proved fatal to rabbits in 24 hours at the latest. Six hoursâ€™ suspension with the
head down had no effect, for the animals when liberated ran about and ate at once.
