The nonlinear graviton construction provides a twistor representation of a curved complex- [os
Riemannian 4-space M, where we find a very simple way of ensuring that M is an Einstein :3
manifold, i.e. Ray = Aap (for given cosmological constant A). This works only in the case where [8
M has anti-self-dual Weyl curvature but is otherwise completely general. In standard flat-space :sS
twistor theory (see §1), a complex space-time point r in CM is represented by a complex line R 2S
(a Riemann sphere) in PT. A very similar situation holds for M, applying to any small-enough
open neighbourhood Vc M of a point ro € M, and we examine how an arbitrary point r of V
arises as a corresponding line R (Riemann sphere in an appropriate topological family) in a certain
complex 3-manifold PT, a deformed version of a tubular neighbourhood PP of a line P in PT.

A striking feature of this construction is that there is no local curvature information in the
‘curved’ twistor space T (where PT is its projective version), despite the fact that there is actual
local curvature in the space V that is constructed from PT. This curvature arises entirely from
global features of T. Locally, T would be identical, when A = 0, to the twistor space T of §1. When
A #0, it would be locally identical, instead, to the twistor space arising from de Sitter 4-space D
with (positive) cosmological constant A (or anti-de Sitter space if A <0). In order to clarify this
distinction, I need first to be more explicit about the structure that T actually acquires in order
that the space-time metric can be encoded into T’s structure, in these two cases.

Both in the case of Minkowski space M and de Sitter space D (and also in anti-de Sitter space)
there are particular antisymmetric 2-valent twistors, fixing the metric structure of the space-time,
which are referred to as infinity twistors [2]. These are I¢’ and Iag, taken to be both complex
conjugates and duals of one another:
