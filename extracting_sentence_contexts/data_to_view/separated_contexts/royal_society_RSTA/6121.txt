The second issue is what would be a believable prequel to the inflationary stage that would make
the inflationary idea more natural. We shall come back to this issue in subsequent sections of this

paper.

(b) Multiverse

Even though according to inflation the bubble leading to our visible domain adequately expanded
and inflated solving in this way many of the cosmological conundrums of standard cosmology,
the complex process of creation and evolution of the whole network of such distinct inflating
bubbles may lead to a very awkward situation, now elaborated to what is called the multiverse. The fact that inflation can be eternal was realized soon after Guth’s original idea, by Paul
Steinhardt [4] and by Alexander Vilenkin [10] for new inflation, and later by Andrei Linde [11]


in the context of the chaotic inflation scenario, where the potential of the scalar field driving
inflation has no flat plateaux. Linde used heuristic arguments to imply that the process of large-
scale fluctuations of the scalar field leads to an eternal, self-reproducing, inflationary multiverse. In
this, each inflating bubble consists of further inflating subregions with each one of these in turn
having further similar ones, at infinitum, a process seemingly progressing endlessly to the future
as well to the past.
