Thus, in this respect also, the hypothesis accords with the interesting fact
lately announced ;—of Professor Hansreen baving ascertained the existence of
a second magnetic pole within the arctic circle. The revolution of the earth
on its axis from west to east seems moreover to harmonize with the idea of
oblique electrical currents ; since rotation in the same direction may be pro-
duced by corresponding electro-magnetic arrangements. Before I conclude, I will briefly mention a few facts relative to the tempera-
ture of some of the mines in Cornwall. At Tingtang copper mine, in the parish of Gwennap, at the bottom of the
engine shaft, which is in killas, and 178 fathoms deep, the water about two
months ago was at the temperature of 82%. In 1820, when the same shaft was
105 fathoms deep, the temperature of the water was 68? :
