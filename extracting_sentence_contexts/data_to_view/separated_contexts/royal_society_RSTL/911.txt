From this effect on a blue ve-
getable colour, we may infer that/ the precipitate was an alka-
line substance, and probably the carbonate of ammoniac ; but
the quantity was much too minute to be the subject of more
decisive experiment. I shall conclude this memoir, with a brief summary of the
facts that are establiched by the preceding experiments. *
Those included under the first head are deducible from the
experiments of Dr. AusTIN.' * Since this paper was written I have extended the inquiry to phosphorated hydro-
genous gas, which expands equally with the carbonated hydrogen ; loses its property of
inflaming when brought into contact with oxygenous gas; and affords evident trace«
of a production of phosphorous or phosphoric acid.
