The development of the Renilla colony shows, however, that ib is unnecessary to go
back further than the Bathyptilec, 80 far at least as the mode of budding is concerned.
The peculiar form of the colony is a result primarily of the circumstance that the longi-
tudinal growth of the axial polyp ceases at an early stage, while the two series of
lateral buds continue to extend forwards until they enclose the axial polyp; and
Secondarily of the fact that new lateral buds are constantly interpolated between
those already formed, and that the lateral buds fuse with each other to some extent.
If we imagine the axial polyp in fig. 189 to become greatly elongated, s0 as to separate
the older buds from one another, and thus to leave room for the younger buds between
them, we should have a colony similar to the Bathyptilum, 1.e., a long central axis
with a single series of lateral buds on each side.

K61akzr's view of the derivation of Renilla involves one serious difficulty on any
monophyletic theory of descent. The original simple progenitor of the Alcyonaria
cannot have Pos8es8ed the 8eptum transversale or the four peduncular septa of the
higher Pennatulids, since these are structures peculiar to the Pennatulacea, and do
