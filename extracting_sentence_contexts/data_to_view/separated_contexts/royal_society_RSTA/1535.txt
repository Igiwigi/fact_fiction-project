This phenomenon, known as ghost stochastic resonance, has
allowed to model pitch perception by the auditory system. Lastly, it has been established that vibrational resonance (VR) occurs when a nonlinear system
is driven by a low-frequency excitation perturbed by a high-frequency (HF) signal [14,15]. In
fact, for an optimal value of the perturbation, the system enhances its response to the low-
frequency excitation. Therefore, the detection of the low frequency by the nonlinear system is
enhanced by the HF perturbation [16-18]. Similar to the SR effect, it is then not surprising that
VR has been proved to occur in neurons models [19] and in neural networks [20,21], leading to
applications in one-dimensional signal processing.
