Conversely, we now consider a strain energy of the form

WF )=f(4© — 3) + gi — tr), (6.3)

where J; = tr(SQ), and the functions f and g must be such that the energy density (6.3) satisfies the
ISCC (4.7) and g is non-constant. If the material is initially unstressed (i.e. $ = 0), the strain energy
density (6.3) defines a general isotropic nonlinear elastic response and the material symmetry
group is given by

Go = 07 (R%).

However, if we consider an initial stress 5 = aM @ M, where M is a unit vector, we observe a
change in the nature of the material symmetry group. In fact, considering that

tr(50'CQ) = tr(SQ), VFeD —> OM=M,
the material symmetry group Qs is given by
Gs= {ac o*(R*)|aM =m},

so that the material is no longer isotropic but transversely isotropic.

Thus, if the material does not satisfy the ISRI, the material symmetry group Gs is not conjugated
with Go and it is not possible to obtain the material symmetry group Go by an elastic distortion of
the material. In other words, if the ISRI condition is not fulfilled, the body may change its material
symmetry group depending on the imposed initial stress field, leading to a modification of the
material response.
