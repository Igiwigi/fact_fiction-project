This inference process may
take the form of a calibration procedure (update our knowledge on parameters
on the basis of observations) or a model selection procedure (which model, among
different alternatives, explains the observations best). The position taken here is that there is not such a thing as an ‘attractor’
of the climate system that is to be ‘discovered’. The hope is that some of its
modes of behaviour are sufficiently decoupled from the rest of the variability
to justify the fact that simple dynamical systems may capture the fundamental
dynamical properties of these modes, and we want to learn about these modes
from palaeoclimate observations. The programme is challenging. Indeed, it was emphasized that different
physical assumptions may lead to dynamical systems with dynamical properties
that are similar enough to produce a convincing visual fit on palaeoclimate data
[61].
