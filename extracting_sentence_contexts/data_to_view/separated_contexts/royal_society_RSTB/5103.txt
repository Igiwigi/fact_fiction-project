They all
have a brick-red fundus, and circular, or nearly circular, disc, which is provided with a
large conical pecten, resembling the thalamus of a raspberry, which fills the entire
surface of the disc. No trace of blood vessels can be perceived in any of the
Geckos’ eyes, and there is certainly no trace of a macula, which is readily seen in
close proximity to the disc in the Apteryx’s eye. In fact, this is the one striking
point of difference between the two. (See Plate 22.) The other exception is that of the Sphenodon.
