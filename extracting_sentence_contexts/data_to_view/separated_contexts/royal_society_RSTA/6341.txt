Clearly, the relatively
slower methanol diffusivity in the above noted zeolites could not be detected by OSIRIS and IRIS
instruments at ISIS as discussed for ZSM-5-140. In particular, the presence of dominant immobile
methanol results in an intense elastic peak that dominates the quasi-elastic broadening, which
might be lost in the background. This assumption gathers strength by the fact that the zeolite
with Si/Al of 140 shows a significant quasi-elastic component (on the same instrument) when the
majority of methanol is mobile (86% in ZSM-5-140), which minimizes the elastic peak contribution
to a great extent, as discussed in ยง5a (figure 6). In line with this, the higher resolution instrument
IN10 at ILL measures D, of methanol of 10~!! m2 s~! in ZSM-5 with Si/Al of 30, while the lower
resolution instrument IN6 (~1-41 ps) at ILL detects only localized methanol in the zeolite [12]. By

contrast, the intermediate resolution of OSIRIS and IRIS instruments is capable of picking up both : =
the localized and non-localized methanol motions under certain conditions, as demonstrated in : =
ยง2a,b [15,16,24,25,35].
