third inwards to the alimentary canal. It is of interest to notice that Toyama (1902)
found 10 pairs of abdominal spiracles in the embryo of Bombyx (see Iuas, 1925, fig. 170).
Of these the two posterior pairs close before hatching. Iam unable to confirm this in
Pieris.

10. Blood and other Cells released into the Yolk.

From the embryo there is for a time a constant release of isolated cells into the yolk.
These are liberated from the whole length of the mesoderm and most markedly from the
anterior mesenteron rudiment. ‘This fact has already been referred to on p. 17. When
the mesoderm is first congregated into paired segmental masses, but not yet forming
definite somites, certain cells, those nearest the yolk, are set free, and for a time they
form an indiscreet sheet of cells partially separating the embryo from the yolk (figs. 16
and 18). Sagittal sections therefore show a loose line of irregularly shaped cells lying
on the inner side of the mesoderm. Those which originate from the mesoderm appear
to retain this position, but those derived from the mesenteron rudiment pass deeply
into the yolk.

Such liberated cells, at first resembling normal insect blood cells, quickly take on a
characteristic appearance. As they pass into the yolk they become spherical and highly
vacuolated, each possessing three or four spherical vacuoles. The yolk in which they
lie, being that adjacent to the embryo, also quickly changes from a compact to a
