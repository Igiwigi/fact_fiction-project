In these two cases the larvae were respectively 8°0 and 12°8 per cent. a |
than the normal, but in each case the water went putrid about the second or thi
day of development, and remained so for two or three days. This fact is quit
sufficient to account for the diminished size of the larve. On the other hand, ii
Experiment 90, where four times as much sperma was added, and in Experiments 15}
and 177, where five times as much was added, and where there was no trace 0
putridity at any time during the course of the development, the larvae vary respe¢
tively by + 6:0, + 51, and — 3°5 per cent., or on an average by + 2°5 per cent,
from those developed under normal conditions, Within certain limits, therefore, th
presence of additional sperma in the water containing the developing larvee has pro
bably a slightly beneficial effect upon their growth. The addition of only a ver,
small quantity of sperma to the ova at the time of impregnation seems to have littl
or no harmful effect.
