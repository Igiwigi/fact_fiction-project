[49].

By way of comparison, in Drosophila, expression diver-
gence of male-biased genes on the X-chromosome evolves
faster than their counterparts in the autosome [50], and signa-
tures of adaptive evolution are prominent in some male-
biased genes on the X-chromosome [51]. It is also possible
that faster-X (or faster-Z) effects benefit the homogametic
sex by favouring the fixation of recessive alleles that are
expressed in the heterogametic sex that benefit the homoga-
metic sex. In fruit flies with male heterogamy, for example,
there is evidence of faster-X effects in female-biased_ tran-
scripts [52-54]. In fact, in species with male heterogamy,
there is often a higher proportion of female- than male-
biased expression in sex-linked transcripts [55-59], and in
some species with female heterogamy, there can be an enrich-
ment in sex-linked genes of transcripts with male-biased
expression [60,61].

Could faster-Z effects account for male-biased expression
in X. borealis? Relevant to this possibility is that adaptation
which involves allele frequency changes at many sites
throughout the genome (polygenic adaptation) or beneficial
