# Morphology. BD

In the Frog, the sporadic mesoblast consists of three kinds of cells, the eosinophile

ell, the hyaline cell, and the rose-reacting cell, together with the red corpuscles and

tttelets. Of the two latter, we, personally, can say nothing from our own know-
; nor have we any reason beyond the general facts of their distribution in the

, ly, for placing them in the same morphological group with the three first-named
ents.* Leaving then the red corpuscles and platelets out of account, we find
hgt the sporadic mesoblast of the Frog contains elements precisely similar to those
hich compose the similar tissue of such a widely divergent animal as Astacus. The
age phagocyte, derived from the hyaline cell and of temporary existence only, is not
mgby found in both animals, but produced by essentially similar conditions in both,

Tiiis exact resemblance between animal forms so diverse is helpful to us, since it gives

i good reason for supposing that the three cell elements of the Frog have arisen by

ta differentiation of a primitive homogeneous sporadic mesoblast, that is, one the

elements of which are all alike.
