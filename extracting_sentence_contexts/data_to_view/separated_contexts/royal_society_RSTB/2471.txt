The young stem is (Gametophyte of
B. virginianum,” ‘ Canadian Inst. Trans.,’ 1898) essentially like the adult. Porauur
has called attention to the fact that in the young stem of certain species of
Botrychium and Ophioglossum an internal endodermis is present, which is continuous
with the external one through the foliar gaps of the central cylinder. Farmer has more recently described a similar phenomenon in the adult plant of
Helminthostachys zeylanica. The central cylinder of the Ophioglossaceze closely
resembles that of the Osmundacew.
