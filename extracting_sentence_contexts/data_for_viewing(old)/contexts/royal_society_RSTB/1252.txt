septa into spore-producing cells ?

Professor Gorse has shown that the trabeculs of Isoetes are derived

potential archesporium ; this I can endorse, and it would, therefore,

appear
trabecul

* are parts of a potential sporogenous tissue converted into sterile
the same appears to be not improbable for Lepidostrobus.* Gorpen remarks (*
of Botany,’ 1892, p. 358) that he “would only attach a biological, that
adaptive, significance to the fact.” My point is that the requirements so w
by Isoetes in the formation of its sterile trabecule, probably made themselve
other plants with large spore-bearing members, and the adaptations to mee
if successful, would become stereotyped as permanent morphological fact
Tmesipteris also, the normal septum is similar in origin to the sporogenous 1
and is undistinguishable from them while young; thus, from the development:
of view it may also be looked upon as a result of sterilization. But, conver
has been shown that in certain abnormal synangia of Z'mesipteris the sept
be completely absent, while in others it has been demonstrated that those
which normally form the septum may become sporogenous ; there is accordin
absolute and essential difference between tissue of the septum and the spore
tissue in the septate synangium of Tmesipteris.
