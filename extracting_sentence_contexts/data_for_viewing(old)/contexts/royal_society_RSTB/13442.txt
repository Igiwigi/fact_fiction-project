half of these epimutations are transmitted across generations
[71]. Furthermore, they occur at rates per methylated region
(mCHG and mCHH regions; figure 3) that are orders of mag-

nitude higher than the rate of mutations per nucleotide [69]. (d) Environmentally induced TE-associated

However, because TE sequences occupy only 20% of the epimutations

genomic space in A. thaliana, the spontaneous epimutation In addition to being generated spontaneously, epimutations

rate per genome is in fact very similar to that of point mutations could be induced by exposure to environmental stresses

We have already mentioned that the moderate loss of to environmental stresses, whether biotic or abiotic, in

A. thaliana indicate that most changes in DNA methylation relies on differences in DNA methylation dynamics between
