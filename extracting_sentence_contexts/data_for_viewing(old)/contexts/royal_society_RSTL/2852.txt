IN an essay of mine on the constitution of the atmosphere, which was printed in
the Transactions for 1826, I signified my intention of following it with a sequel of
experiments to ascertain if possible which of the two views therein deyeloped was
most countenanced by facts. I now proceed to give an account of such investiga-
tions relating to this subject as have engaged my attention during a long period of
years.

It may be needful to premise certain facts which are, I believe, universally ad-
mitted as indisputable ; namely, that the atmosphere consists principally of two elastic
fluids, azote and oxygen, either mixed by some mechanical law, or otherwise com-
bined by a chemical principle in proportion nearly as four parts of the former to one
of the latter in volume; that the two elastic fluids may be obtained separately in
a state of purity ; that when thus obtained they may be mixed in all possible propor-
tions; and that the aggregate yolumes in such cases are just equal to the sum of the
two volumes of the ingredients : also, that any body which has a chemical affinity
for either of them $0 as to combine with it in a separate state, will also combine with
it in the mixed state.

It is also pretty generally admitted that oxygen and azote are capable of chemical
combinations in five or more definite proportions, namely,
