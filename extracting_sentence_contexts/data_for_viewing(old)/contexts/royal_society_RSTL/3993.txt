elastic bodies. The phenomenon of induced contraction would seem to be a first fact
of induction of that force which circulates in the nerves and which arouses muscular
contraction.

Admitting that we cannot give a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon of
induced contraction by recurring to electricity or any other known causes, as I think
I have abundantly proved, it appears to me that we cannot, confining ourselvyes to
a first fact, as is that of induced contraction, interpret it differently from what we
have done. The induced contraction is only a new phenomenon of nervous force, a
phenomenon of which we have given the principal laws in this memoir. It seems
to me therefore more just to call that henceforth muscular induction, which I have
hitherto called induced contraction. I shall conclude this memoir with some appli-
cations of muscular induction to physiology.

By the experiment described above (fig. 14.), it is proved that the muscular induc-
tion is propagated in a nerye at the same time towards the two extremitiesâ€”towards
the muscle as well as towards the nervous centre. If the muscular induction not
only acts upon the nerve in contact with the muscle but also through some inter-
posed bodies, it is natural to admit that when a muscular mass enters into contrac-
tion by the irritation acting on one of its nerves, the phenomenon of induction should
