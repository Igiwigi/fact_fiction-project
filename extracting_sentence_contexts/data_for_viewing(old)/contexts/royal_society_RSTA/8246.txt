question whether the method can be modified to meet our requirements: what we
have first to discuss is the question whether, because the conjugate relations fail, there
is any necessity to discard the assumption that an arbitrary disturbance may be
expanded in a series of normal solutions, satisfying equations of the type (25) and
the boundary conditions (9).

Is the Expansion in Normal Co-ordinates Valid in the General Case ?

16. A remark by Raytetcu* suggests that he had some doubt as to the validity of
the expansion : “ From his (KELvin’s) results it appears that it is not possible to find a
solution applicable to an unlimited fluid which shall be periodic with respect to x, and
remain finite when y= --%,... The cause of the failure would appear to lie in
the fact, indicated by Lord Kutviy’s solution, that the stability is ultimately of a higher
order than can be expressed by any simple exponential function of the time.”

Orr} also considered this question in relation to our problem. He set himself to
establish, (1) that the “ frequency ” equation (from which the 4’s are to be found)

has an infinite number of roots, and (2) that the expansion, if valid, can be effected.
