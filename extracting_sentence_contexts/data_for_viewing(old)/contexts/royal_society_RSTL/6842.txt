S in considerable number on the arteries of the frog generally, though these nerves, and
S more especially those ramifying in the coats of the vessels of mammalia and birds, are
S8till considered by many authorities in Germany to be fibres of connective tissue.
'Z The nerves which supply the small arterial branches in the voluntary muscles of the

S vessel, while the other was distributed to the elementary fibres of the muscle.

£ In figs. 5, 15, & 16, which represent ganglion-cells at an early period of development,

Z 8everal are scen connected together; in fact, the matter of which the several cells are

2 composed is continuous. This must be the case, at least for a certain time, because a

5 number of cells may be formed by the division of one (figs. 5, 11, 12, & 15).

Q After a time, as the new cells separate further and further from each other, the inter-
vening matter which connects them becomes thinner and thinner, and forms what would
be properly termed. a fibre, figs. 15 & 16; and as the cells move away from the line
where their formation commenced, these connecting fibres become finer and finer, and
at last could not be distinguished from fibres of connective tissxue. It is probable, in
many instances, that all continuity of structure between some of the cells ceases ; but it
is to be remarked in all cases, that the nerve-fibres in the substance of a ganglion cross
