edges of supergranular cells, where they coalesce to form the chromospheric network. Along the
way, a combination of diffusive shuffling, tangling and magnetic reconnection with neighbouring
regions helps to maintain the system in a dynamical steady state (e.g. [24]). We discuss the
energetic consequences of this emergence and cancellation for coronal heating in §4.

There is some debate concerning the turbulent nature of the photospheric magnetic elements.
High-resolution movies of individual granules often convey the appearance of quite ‘laminar’
overturning motions. The kinetic energy spectrum of horizontal bright-point motions is
continuous in frequency space (e.g. [12,25]), but it does not necessarily show the power-
law behaviour expected from an active cascade. Time-dependent MHD simulations of the
chromosphere and corona (see §3) typically do not need there to be fully turbulent motions
injected at the lower boundary, since a rapid cascade develops naturally above the photosphere.
However, it is difficult to avoid the fact that the deep convection zone—host to the highly
nonlinear solar dynamo—must be strongly turbulent [26]. Observations of the spatial diffusion
of magnetic elements in the photosphere also show statistical properties similar to those seen
in simulations of turbulent diffusion [14,27]. Further elucidation will likely come from the next
generation of high-resolution solar observations, such as the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope
(DKIST) [28] and the Coronal Solar Magnetism Observatory (COSMO) [29].

3. Waves and turbulence in the open-field corona

The idea that the solar atmosphere is heated by the dissipation of upward-propagating waves has
been studied for more than half a century (e.g. [30]). This remains a compelling explanation—
especially for the open-field regions that connect to the solar wind—because the energy
responsible for coronal heating must somehow propagate up to the heights where the heat is
