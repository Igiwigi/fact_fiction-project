Turning then to Myrmecobius, with its eight or nine cheek-teeth, of which only three
are commonly reckoned as premolars, I examined several young specimens in order to
see if this animal, like the abnormal Phascologale, had not really four premolars, as no
exact observations on it had been published, and the usual determination rested
merely on the shape of the teeth. In fact, even if no tooth-change could be found, it
seemed possibile enough that the small tooth commonly reckoned as the first molar
should be really a persistent milk pm‘, the permanent tooth corresponding to it having
become aborted.* This theory, however, I have been able to disprove by the exami-
nation of such ajaw as is shown in Plate 27, fig. 9. Here we find that, of the whole set
of cheek-teeth (premolars and molars), the first, second, fourth, and fifth are fully up, and
all much on a level with one another, while, on the other hand, the third has scarcely
penetrated the gum, and stands therefore far below the level of the rest. Hence we
see that this third tooth, by its very lowness of position, or rather lateness of develop-
ment, is certainly the true pm‘, even without there being any milk-tooth aboye it ; for,
had it been pm’, it would have been at all stages, as with other animals, fully on a level
with the teeth next in front of and behind it. Of a milk-tooth preceding this pm* I
can find no trace whatever, although it is possible that, considering the very rudi-
