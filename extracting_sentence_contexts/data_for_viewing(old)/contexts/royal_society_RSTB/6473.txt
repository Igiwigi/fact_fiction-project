in their entirety in any one preparation, and it must be pointed out here that the
interpretation of their structure, as indicated in fig. 19 (right-hand side cup), has
been arrived at by the study of many series of sections of F.W.A. fixed material, after
treatment with a variety of stains. The visual sensory cell is divided into two well-
defined regions—a peripheral portion (oft. ves.), projecting into the cavity of the cup,
and a sensory portion (oft. s.c.), intruding between the pigment cells. The former
is seen to best advantage in iron-alum haematoxylin preparations, after F.W.A.
fixation, when it appears as a very lightly staining vesicle, slightly swollen at its free
end and projecting for a distance of about 4-5 yu into the cavity ofthe cup. Although
the vesicle is almost transparent, its outlines are well defined, and its shape is not in
any way variable. This is important because of the possibility of mistaking the
vesicles for droplets of secretion in the process of being exuded into the cavity. The
secretion is, in fact, very different in appearance, distribution, and staining properties
from the optic vesicles, which latter are only to be found as the peripheral extensions
of the visual sensory cells into the optic cup. The central portion of the sensory
element (opt. s.c.) forms the body of the cell. Its disposition follows that of the
pigmented cell in that, although in its middle region the cell is set almost at right
angles to the wall of the cavity, its tapering inner end bends round so as to be
orientated along the longitudinal axis of the cup. Each cell body is of a narrow
cylindrical form, some 12 » long, and is broadest at the point where the nucleus is
situated. The cytoplasm of the cell reacts hardly at all to the usual stains, but the
small nucleus (nuc. s.c.), not more than 1 yu in diameter, is easily demonstrated. At
its base the sensory cell is continued as a fine fibrilla which merges with the fibrillae
of the subepithelial plexus.
