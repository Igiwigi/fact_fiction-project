posterior pattern resembles that of the prior NEE models,
with notable positive anomalies in Scandinavia, Germany,
France, UK and Czechia but with the inversions showing
stronger anomalies both for the summer and annual mean.
Negative NEE anomalies in the summer are seen a posteriori
for the Iberian Peninsula, Switzerland and _ southeast
Europe. Note that the positive anomaly centred on northern
Portugal is due solely to the inversion LU-all, which included
the site Sierra de Gredos (GIC) in northwest Spain (electronic
supplementary material, figure S9)â€”a site that appears to be
influenced by very local fluxes that are not well captured by
the atmospheric transport model and may result in this arte-
fact. Notable is that the inversions show considerable
convergence for the summer and annual NEE anomalies for

the Temperate region, of 0.23 + 0.25 and 0.09 + 0.06 Pg C yr was offset by a decrease in the mid to late summer uptake
(positive NEE anomaly), which was very likely due to a

soil water deficit. The dry conditions also contributed to a
particularly bad fire season in Northern Europe, particularly
in Sweden, where estimates from the Global Fire Emissions

The pattern of positive summer and annual NEE anomalies
(figure 4) corresponds closely with positive temperature and
negative precipitation and SWC anomalies (electronic sup-
