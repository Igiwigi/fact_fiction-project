The approximate maximum bending-moments previously determined for this ship are,
for till water 5080 foot-tons, on a wave-crest 16,400 foot-tons, in a wave-hollow 31,000
foot-tons; the approximate maximum shearing-forces under the same circumstances are
respectively 140 tons, 220 tons, and 395 tons. When ashore the maximum shearing-
force is, of course, 1230 tons. By comparing this ship with the * Bellerophon ' and
* Minotaur,” it will be seen that the maximum sagging-moment bears a larger ratio to
the product of the displacement by the length than it does in the two ironclads. 'This
is due to the fact, already illustrated, of the greater concentration of weights at the
centre of the paddle-wheel steamship. These three examples afford us the means of approximating to the limiting values of
the shearing-forces and bending-moments of ships supported at the extremities only,

and from them we obtain the following limits. For shearing-forces the maximum lies
between one half and three fifths of the displacement, and for bending-moments between
one seyenth and one sixth of the product of the displacement by the length.
