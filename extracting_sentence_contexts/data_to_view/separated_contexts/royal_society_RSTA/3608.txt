The complexity of this result is reduced by the transformation — 2?=¢ or z= cV/t,
: o

uno 2**"D(w + 1) Pu +0 + 1)

which gives 2~"J, (z) = , an integral function of t.

And now we have for the asymptotic value of 2~"J, (z) the unique expression
2n+1 (..)

which is valid for all values of arg ¢ between — 7 and z. This shows at once that 2~"J, (z), qua function of t, has no imaginary roots which
are not at a finite distance from the negative part of the real axis. In point of
fact, these roots are known to be real and negative when n > — 1||. Hence the
asymptotic expansion for

is valid for all points in the neighbourhood of ¢ = © except those which are at
a finite distance from the zeros of the function. § 6.
