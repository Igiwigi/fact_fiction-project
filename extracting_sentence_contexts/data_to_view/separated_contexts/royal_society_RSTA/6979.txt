Nevertheless, one notices that the experimental rates of growth for the lowest super-
saturations are below the theoretical curve (47); in particular, the rate of growth at

og = 3-8 x 10-3(AT = 0°-037)
is < 10-5 times the rate of growth given by the linear law. The reduction given by formula (47)
is only a factor /a, ~ 5 x 10-* with respect to the linear law. This fact could be explained
in a number of ways:

(i) Itis an obvious corollary to our view of crystal growth that it is susceptible to poisoning
by traces of impurity, particularly at low supersaturations at which the number of

dislocations producing growth is smallest. From this point of view new measurements of
the rate of growth would be very welcome.

(ii) There may bea critical supersaturation of the type (51) of the order of 7, ~ 10-2, and
therefore the dislocations are about 10~*cm. apart; nevertheless, we are loath to draw this
conclusion from such slight evidence.

(iii) Of course, it would be possible to choose a larger value for ¢,, in order to explain the
small rates of growth at the lowest supersaturations, but the corresponding value for x, ~ 6a
