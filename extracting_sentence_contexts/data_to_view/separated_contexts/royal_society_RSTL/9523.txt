These secondary vesicles (Plate 68,
fig. 4, 3, 3) are provided with an epithelial wall, and with contents similar to the
primary vesicles. From the fact that by their growth they have evidently flattened
out to a greater or less degree the epithelium separating them from the cavity of the
primary vesicle, it is probable that the two layers of epithelium separating the cavity
of the s8mall, from that of the large vesicle sometimes give way, allowing the contents
of the two vesicles to mix. At the same time others of these small vesicles probably
grow outwards becoming independent struetures (Plate 68, fig. 4, 5, 5).
