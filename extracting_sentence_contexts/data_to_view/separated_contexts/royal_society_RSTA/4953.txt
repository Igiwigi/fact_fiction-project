In fact, turbulence in dark cores giving birth to
stars may be reduced and this may make the traditional ambipolar diffusion, ie. the drift
of neutrals in relation to ions, important. However, reconnection diffusion must be a part of
the star formation paradigm. In fact, it can successfully explain many pieces of observational
data that are completely puzzling within the ambipolar diffusion paradigm. This includes,
for instance, the famous ‘magnetic breaking catastrophe’ for accretion discs which is the
inability of removing magnetic flux from accretion discs fast enough to enable formation
of such discs. Similarly, the poor correlation of density and magnetic field in ISM is also
impossible to explain on the basis of ambipolar diffusion.
