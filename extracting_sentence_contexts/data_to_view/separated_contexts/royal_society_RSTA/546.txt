'= 0. Therefore
Pa(7) and z(r) are equal when 7 = 0 or 0. From these facts and equation (52) we deduce
that the equation p,(7) = z?(r) is approximately true for all values of 7. As a matter of fact
the approximation is very close indeed, and the error involved in assuming that it is exactly

true can be neglected for all practical purposes. We have done this throughout the foregoing

paper.
