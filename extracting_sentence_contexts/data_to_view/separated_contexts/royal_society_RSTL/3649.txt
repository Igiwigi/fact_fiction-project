201. The ruddy tint which comes out when the green is destroyed by light, is in
all probability that which gives the whole colour to sere and withered leaves, whe-
ther simply disclosed by the destruction of the green which masked it in the live
state of the leaf, or matured by exposure to light during the whole season, either out
of the elements of the green colouring matter destroyed, or from the other juices of
the vegetable. It deserves to be noticed in connexion with this, that all the lively
vegetable greens have a large portion of red in their composition, and are in fact di-
chromatic. A good example of such a colour is a solution of sap-green, which, used
as a prism, is seen to transmit both red and green rays, separating them by a broad
interval which increases as the thickness or density of the solution is increased ; the
red ultimately preponderating, and the green being extinguished. If we view a
garden or shrubbery through a glass of a pure and deep red colour, every shrub, such
as the laurel, of a lively and brilliant foliage, and especially green grass, will appear
scarlet.
