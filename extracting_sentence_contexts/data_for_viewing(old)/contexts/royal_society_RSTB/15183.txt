the brain responds: how you see things that you're not sure
you're seeing, and that kind of uncanny and hallucinatory qual-
ity of everyday life’ [6]. Interestingly, the emotional reactions of
the public, and even of other artists, to indeterminate artworks
has not always been positive—initially at least [7]. Such was
the hostility to Impressionism at its first exhibition in Paris in
1874 that people reportedly spat at the paintings in disgust [8].

A personal encounter with visual indeterminacy when
I was a student—described in Pepperell [5]—inspired the
creation of a large body of artworks that aimed to evoke
the same sense of perceptual uncertainty in other people that
Ihad briefly experienced myself. In fact, the longer one studies
these works in person the more possible meanings seem to
suggest themselves, yet the more certain one becomes that
they have no specific meaning at all. The development of this
work and related scientific studies are described elsewhere
[9,10], and examples can be seen in figure 1. Here I consider
these works from a PP perspective.

One of the challenges in developing the technique used to
make these works was the need to satisfy a version of what is
known as the Goldilocks effect, the finding from psychology
that human infants prefer stimuli having the optimal balance
of complexity and simplicity [11]. To evoke the visually indeter-
