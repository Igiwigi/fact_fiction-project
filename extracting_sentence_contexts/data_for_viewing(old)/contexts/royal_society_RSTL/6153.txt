oceurs in this structure, but, many” nerves, which to ordinary powers appear to
consist of a single fibre, are found really to be composed of several individual
fibres enclosed in one transparent sheath. At @ is a fibre which is widest at
that part of the nerve nearest to the nervous centre, while at þ one 1s repre-
sented which is wider towards the peripheral extremity of the nerve. At the
lower part of the drawing, two of the fine fibres have been pressed out of the
transparent tissue, and one of them is broken off.

Fig. 2. Represents a portion of a compound fibre from the tongue of the frog. The
branch from this (not more than z7;7th of an inch in diameter) is seen to
contain three or four separate fibres; and it will be obseryed that, as this
nerve passes to the larger trunk. fibres proceed from it which pass in both
directions,—a fact which 1 have repeatedly observed in all the animals I have
examined.

Separate branches. The subdivisions of the oval bodies are well seen.
