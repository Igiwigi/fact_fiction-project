To the question what is the positive criterion of a Diffuse series no clear answer up
to the present has been given. We find in general three sets of series associated
together. Two of these have the same limits, the other a limit peculiar to itself.

The latter is the Principal series, and the difference between the wave numbers of its
first line and of its limit gives the limit of the other two. Of the other two series,
one shows a Zeeman effect of the same nature as that in the Principal. This is called
the Sharp series—or (by Kayser and Runeer) the 2nd associated series. The third
series is called the Diffuse—or the 1st associated series. It has in fact a negative
kind of criterion. The preceding definitions apply to the three series in all elements,
including such elements as Li, He, and others which show singlet series. When
doublets and triplets appear, we have a simple physical criterion for the Principal
+ Series in that it is that series in which the doublets or triplets converge with increasing
S order. This criterion can be applied even when the 1st line has not been observed.

‘.but further knowledge may show that in certain cases such satellites may appear in

S visible arrangement in the spectrum, we attempt to represent their wave numbers by
~, formule of the recognised types, we have further criteria for the Principal and Sharp,
