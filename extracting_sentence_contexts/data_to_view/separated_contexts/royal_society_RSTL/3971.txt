Heat applied to any of these magnetic solutions did not diminish or affect
their power.

2360. These results with the salts of the magnetic metals conjoin with those be-
fore quoted, as tending to show that the non-magnetic metals could not by any
change of temperature be rendered magnetic (2398.), but as a class are distinct from
iron, nickel, and cobalt; for none of the compounds of the non-magnetic metals
show, as yet, any indication of ordinary magnetic force, whereas in respeet of these
three substances all their compounds possess it.

2361. In illustration of the power which the iron and other similar solutions give
in the investigation of magnetic phenomena (2357.), as well as in reference. to the
general conclusions to be drawn from all the facts described in this paper, I will
proceed to describe certain anticipated results which were obtained by the employ-
ment of these solutions in the magnetic field.

2362. A clear solution of the proto-sulphate of iron was prepared, in which one
ounce of the liquid contained seventy-four grains of the hydrated crystals; a second
solution was prepared containing one volume of the former and three yolumes of
water; a third solution was made of one volume of the stronger svlntion and fifteen
volumes of water. These solutions I will distinguisb as Nos, 1, 2, and 3; the pro-
portions of crystals of sulphate of iron in them were respectively as 16, 4, and 1 per
cent, nearly.
