In s8ome of these
ganglion-cells the spiral is reduced to two or three coils (fig. 42), as is observed elge-
where, but I cannot but conclude that every cell has at least two fibres. Nor can I agree with Professor KOLLIKER in the statement that the ganglion-cells
have no connexion with the © transcurrent ” fibres of the vagus. Although I have not
been able to demonstrate how many fibres of the vagus are connected with the ganglion-
cells, nevertheless, looking generally at the course of the fibres, and at the number of
the cells, and considering the facts observed in other ganglia, I regard it as very probable
that many of them are connected with the cells.

frog are numerous ganglion-cells.
