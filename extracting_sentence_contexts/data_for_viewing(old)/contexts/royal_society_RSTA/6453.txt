their behaviour (see [1] and references therein). However, there is still much to be explored
and understood about how, if, and under which conditions these notions can be defined
in certain central chapters of contemporary physics, notably in quantum mechanics and the
gauge theories of fundamental interactions. In the case of quantum mechanics, the statistics of
identical particles challenge the understanding of the relations between identity, individuality
and indistinguishability inherited from classical physics (see §3 below). In particular, are quantum
systems self-identical and distinguishable individuals? If not, what are the ontological categories
that are needed to describe quantum systems? In the case of gauge theories such as general
relativity and Yang-Mills theories, the fundamental role played by (local) symmetries seems to
challenge the idea according to which indiscernible configurations should be simply—as Leibniz
famously argued in the correspondence with Clarke [20]—identified (see §4 below). In particular,
are gauge symmetries a mechanism to control the representational redundancy associated with
the existence of different coordinate systems or do they encode some deep fact about the ‘logic
of nature’ [21]? Are gauge symmetries just the consequence of a mathematical ‘surplus structure’

Since any definition is an identity, identity itself cannot be defined’ [5, p. 80].


(Redhead) [22], a mere ‘descriptive fluff’ (Earman) [23]? Can we simply get rid of these ‘ghosts’
(Wigner) [24] or do they play a fundamental role that has yet to be properly understood?

In mathematics, equality propositions of the form a=b are fundamental and omnipresent
components of mathematical discourse. Even if we might expect that the significance of such a
basic building block of mathematics should be clear by now, the understanding of equalities is still
under discussion. This problem acquired more relevance since the development of category theory
