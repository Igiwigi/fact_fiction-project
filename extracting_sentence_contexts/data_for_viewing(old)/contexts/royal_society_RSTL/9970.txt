3. The specific graviby of the alloys varies slightly, and is a little above the mean
specific gravity of their constituents. This was also observed in the case of the five
chlorobromiodides of silver previously described (p. 1140), and in thab of the lead-silver
iodide alloy (p. 1146), and while the specific gravity of Cuz], is 56936, and of AgT
56750, that of the alloys is as follows :—

Ongly, AgT . . - + $7802
Cnglz. 2AgT . . » + 57225
OngT,. 8Agt . . . - 57160
Ougl,. 4AgT . . - . 57064
Cugl,.12Agl . . . . 56950

4. The melting points do not differ much from each other, in fact those of Cugl,.2Agl,
CugTz.3Agl, Cugl,.4Agl, and Cuylz.12AgT, are practically the same; but they are
considerably lower than those of their constituents : 7.e., more than 100? C. lower
than that of iodide of copper, and more than 30? C. lower than that of iodide of
gilver. This was also noticed in the case of the chlorobromiodides of silyer, and in
that of the lead-silver iodide alloy.

5. While both the iodide of copper and the iodide of silver are highly crystalline in
structure, even in thin layers, the copper-silver iodides are resinous in fracture and
transparent in thin layers, even when they contain as much as 65 per cent. of iodide
of silver. With greater percentages the structure becomes slightly crystalline.

6. It is obvious that some of the alloys possess three points of similar density ;
