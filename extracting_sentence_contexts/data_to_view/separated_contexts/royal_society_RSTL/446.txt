With respect to the cause which, notwithstanding the above- /
mentioned mode of crystallization, would still occasion the frac-

ture to have the same direction as if the increase of the crystal
had been produced by a deposition on the faces of the primitive
rhomboid, it may, I think, be explained by supposing that, in
this case, the elements of the crystallization might already be
real, though small, secondary crystals, for instance, small hex-
aedral prisms; and that the fracture would then be nothing more
than the result of the sum of all the partial fractures of each of
them, *

PHENOMENA WITH RESPECT TO LIGHT. The prismatic crystals of corundum, as well as the pyramidal
ones, when their extremities are terminated by faces which are
perpendicular to their axes, very frequently have those termi-
nal faces chatoyant. This property is the natural effect of the

* I had finished writing this Paper, when Mr. Gaeviile had the curiosity to
cause one of the hexaedral prisms of imperfect corundum, from the coast of Malabar,
the terminal faces of which exhibited the concentric hexagons above spoken of, to
he cut transversely, This section sbewed a: very interesting fact, and one that adds
some probability to what I have $aid respecting the cause which produces this pheno-
mencn. One of the parts of this crystal (which crystal is sawed into three, and po-
lizhed,) exhibits the appearance represented in Fig. 38, A.
