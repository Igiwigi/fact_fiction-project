The same style prevails on the east side of our basaltic area,
after its boundary ceases to be the confine of sea and land ;
for the limestone fagades at Garron Point, (considerably above
the level of the sea) exactly resemble those of Dunluce and
Kenbaan at the water edge; and Cave Hill (several miles
from the sea, and nearly one from the shallow estuary of
Belfast,) exhibits basaltic fagades at the height of one thou-
sand feet, precisely similar, and little inferior to those of
Magilligan. The exact resemblance'between our inland fagades (on the
east and west sides of ourarea/)'to those on the shore, proves
them tobe all effects from the same cause, and that our accu-
mulated strata have in all these similar instances been cut
down vertically by the same agent, and that this agent was
not the sea.

Nor has this powerful agent confined its operations to our
coast, or tothe periphery of our basaltic area ; we-can trace
it over its whole surface.; we find throughout its interior, simi-
lar, though very diminutive abruptions, executed precisely in
the same manner, that is, strata cut across by a long vertical
facade, their planes on the upper side perfectly undisturbed,
while on the lower side all the materials of which that part of
the stratum was. once composed are completely carried off, —
(See 6th fact.) We are now unavoidably led into a discussion of a question
which has at all times occupied the attention of naturalists. v8 Dr. Ridfikiips08”s Letter on the basatti: Surface
