Milankovitch cycles are the sole pacemaker for the Quaternary ice ages. At the same
ime, it is undoubtedly the case that Milankovitch was the true pioneer in providing
a basis for the modelling of the climatic response to orbital forcing, both during and
efore the ice ages.
A belief that a concerted effort should now be made to use astronomical cyclicity
o calibrate a substantial portion of geological time, in terms of absolute age on an
astronomical calendar, was the driving force behind the organization of this meeting.
The contributors to this volume cover all the main scientific components that will
e needed in order to achieve this objective; the Meeting on 9-10 December 1998
attracted many other workers active in this area, generating very valuable discussion.
The papers in this issue speak for themselves; one significant additional point to
which we would draw attention arose during the day following the Discussion Meet-
ing. As Laskar (this issue) points out, despite the fact that a purely mathematical
solution to the orbital calculations is intrinsically limited to a maximum extension
into the past of ca.30 Ma, some of the long-period frequencies that may be found
in geological records are stable or calculable over much longer intervals. The 406 ka
eccentricity cycle is particularly interesting in this respect, and indeed it seems real-
istic to propose the establishment of a stratigraphic scheme based on this cycle.
An extended, astronomically calibrated geological time-scale will open the door to
a spectacular range of scientific rewards. A better understanding of a wide range of
climatic, geophysical and evolutionary processes and mechanisms will be possible.
