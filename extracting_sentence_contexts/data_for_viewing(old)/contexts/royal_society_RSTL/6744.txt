he phosphatic manure; and the actual amount of Nitrogen was still further increased

y the addition of ammonia to the atmosphere of the plants; and the percentage of
itrogen in the dry substance was also greater where the ammonia was supplied, than
the corresponding cases without it. The experiments without ammonia were made
free air. The Nitrogen in the produce was about seven times that of the seeds where
Ãž phosphates were employed; about twelve times that of the seed witn the smaller
antity of phosphate ; and about twenty times that of the seed with the larger amount
f phosphate.

M. PzrznoLDr considered it difficult to account for the fact of M. BoUsSINGAULT get-
ting little or no increase of Nitrogen when he grew plants in free air, which must have
Supplied 8ome ammonia, even though rain and dew were excluded. He thinks the error
amst be on the side of M. Bovss1NGAULT.

It is 8een that the explanations or conclusions of these several arbitrators are nearly
as conflicting as those of M. BoUss1NGAULT and M. G. Viiue themselves.
For ourselves we are free to confess that we are unable to discover, either in the
