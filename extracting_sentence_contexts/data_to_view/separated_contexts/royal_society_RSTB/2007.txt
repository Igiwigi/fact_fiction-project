These bundles, with many others like them, lie well within the internal sclerenchyma

. (see Plate 6, photograph 5, v.b. The phloem is excellently preserved, and is evidently
limited to the outer side of the xylem. The smallest xylem-elements are adjacent to
the phloem, and in fact the structure is in all respects that of the well-known
“exarch” vascular bundles of Myeloxylon. Photograph 15, showing a similar pair, is taken from a more external part of the
cortex, lying within the triangular space indicated in Plate 10, fig. 2, between the
hypoderma, o.c. and the internal sclerenchyma sc. This space, as proved by the
comparison of successive transverse sections, represents the base of a leaf, which at a
higher level begins to become free from the stem (photograph 2, Pet.).
