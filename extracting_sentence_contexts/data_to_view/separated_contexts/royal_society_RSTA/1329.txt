The : 2
microstructures were motivated by a three-phase example [31] having cubic symmetry, where it : 3
was rigorously shown that the Hall coefficients Ril , RH and Re of all three isotropic phases can be : =I

non-negative, while at the same time R# is negative. One can explain this [29,31] in terms of the
‘matrix valued’ electric field E(x) whose three column vectors e1 (x), e2(x), and e3(x) each solve the
conductivity equations, with zero magnetic field (i.e. the same x(x) and p = pI). Assuming (E) = I,
a perturbation argument [31,32] shows that the sign change of the Hall coefficient is related to the
fact that the trace of the cofactor matrix of E(x) changes sign, at least in certain regions in the
unit cell of periodicity. On the other hand, in any multiple rank laminates (with (E) =I) Briane
and Nesi show that the determinant of E(x) remains positive [33], whereas it does take negative
values in certain regions in the interlinked tori geometries [34]. While they show that the trace of
the cofactor matrix of E(x) can change sign in three-phase multiple rank laminates, it is an open
question as to whether it can change sign in two-phase multiple rank laminates.
