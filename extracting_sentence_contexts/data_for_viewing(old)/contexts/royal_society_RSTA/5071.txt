In the case of continuously growing extrusions, there is some disagreement with work by Polak
[49] who attempted to extend the EGM model with somewhat different assumptions concerning
the migration of point defects from the PSB to the surrounding matrix. The Polak model predicts,
in addition to continuously growing extrusions in the centre of the PSB, intrusions at both PSB-
matrix interfaces. The EGM model essentially predicts only extrusions and no intrusions and
regards intrusion-like deepenings as microcracks which arise as a consequence of the extrusions
that develop first. In detailed studies, mainly on fatigued polycrystalline stainless steel (which
may not be comparable to copper!) by AFM, Man ef al. [33] have found some indications of
intrusions which are very narrow and small compared with the extrusions. The observations
deviate in some details from the predictions of Polak’s model, as summarized recently [50]. The
experimental evidence confirms essentially that the formation of extrusions is the dominant effect
and suggests that ‘intrusions’ are in fact embryonic stage I shear cracks that form as a consequence
of the previously formed extrusions. As an example of more recent modelling of cyclic strain
localization and fatigue crack initiation in PSBs, reference is made to the work of Sangid [51].

In addition to stage I shear cracks, also intercrystalline cracks are induced at grain boundary
(GB) sites, where PSBs impinge. Initially, this was surprising, since intercrystalline cracking
was known to occur at higher amplitudes [52] but had not been noted at lower amplitudes.
The PSB-GB cracks occur at low to intermediate loading amplitudes in the regime of PSB
