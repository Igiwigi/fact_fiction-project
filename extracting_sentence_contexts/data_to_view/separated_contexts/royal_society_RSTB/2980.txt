Section 28.—The more Rapid Flow through Vessels Completely Filled with Sup
when Subjected to Pressure. This is the direct result of the removal of the Jammy’s chain from the vessels with
its high resistance to flow. The fact that even then the flow is always slower than
it should be from a viscosity calculation, may be ascribed to the effect of the
irregularities in the interior of the walls of the wood-vessels, and of the presence of
more or less transverse partitions. These factors, together with the change of
conductivity always shown in cut stems, would effectually disguise the existence of a
pumping action aiding in the onward flow, for this would be relatively feeble in a
short length of stem. The same applies to the fact that flow is possible down a stem
as well as up it, while the experiments which showed that the resistance to acropetal
flow was practically the same as to basipetal flow in horizontal stems under similar
conditions, have only been performed on short isolated lengths of terminal branches.
