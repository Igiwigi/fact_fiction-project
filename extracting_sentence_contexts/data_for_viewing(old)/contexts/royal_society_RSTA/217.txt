Supporting the eep via text mining 3837

In figure 2, the numbers shown on branches other than Teachers and staff
correspond to documents that are assigned multiple labels, i.e. a label from the
Teachers and staff branch as well as a label from one or more other branches of
the taxonomy. This facilitates rapid location of very specific sets of documents.
For example, documents that concern behavioural problems in the classroom can
easily be located by selecting those documents that are classified under both Care,
welfare and behaviour and Teachers and staff.

(b) Machine-learning methods for document classification

Owing to the large number of documents in the eep database, and the fact that
more documents are being added all the time, it is not a practical solution for
all documents to be classified manually. Rather, we have used machine-learning
methods to perform automatic classification of the documents in the database.

As a starting point, domain experts assigned appropriate (and mostly multiple)
categories to 2157 documents, thus providing a gold-standard corpus by which
to evaluate the performance of machine-learned classifiers. The features used
for the automatic classification include unigrams (i.e. all unique single words
that occur in a document), bigrams and trigrams (all unique groups of two or
three consecutive words), as these have been demonstrated to be efficient for
text categorization (Sasaki et al. 2009). These features were extracted from the
documents following the application of the Porter stemmer (Porter 1997), which
