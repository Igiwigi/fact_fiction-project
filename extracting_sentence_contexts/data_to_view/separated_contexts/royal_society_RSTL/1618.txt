There cannot be a doubt that the instruments mentioned
by Du HALDE, as having been found by the missionaries on
their first entrance into the country, were constructed by the
Arabians: His observation, that © the uses of these instru-

the constellations, which are 28 in number,” proves nothing
to the contrary. The guns which were cast for the Chinese
by Europeans, were always inscribed with Chinese characters ;
and the ungrateful vanity of that people has invariably led
them, when they have borrowed any thing from foreigners,
to conceal the debt as much as possible. In proof of this,
the writer is able to state the following fact : when Mr.
PearsoN made them his invaluable present 'of the vaccine
inoculation, it was accompanied by a small pamphlet in Chi-
nese, containing a few necessary directions as to the use of
the virus, and stating the discovery to have been English. An expurgata edition of this little book was very s0on after
published, in which not one word was retained as to its
origin, nor any trace by which it could be known that the
