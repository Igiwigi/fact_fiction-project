© * Hitherto we have only determined, by various methods, the value of the angle w, and thus obtained a
S linear relation between the three axes of the ellipsoid of induction. If, by considerations exceeding the
© limits of this paper, we should be enabled to get the ratio itself of these axes, we could hence deduce the form
of the magnetic particles of the examined erystal, supposing that, in fact, these particles are similar ellip-
s0ids, 8imilarly directed, all induced by the magnetic pole, but not sensibly inducing each other. Mr. W.
\ Trnonsox, however, has published a curious theorem, according to which a body of any exterior shape is
Li influenced by an infinitely distant pole like a certain ellipsoid whose axes are to be determined in each
