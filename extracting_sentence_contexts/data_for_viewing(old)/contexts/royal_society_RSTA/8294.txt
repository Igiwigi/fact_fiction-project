The article on Farapay in the “ Dictionary of National Biography ” by Professor
Joun Tynpaut, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., who was for so many years close to Farapay
in his thoughts, showed appreciation of the metallurgical researches in the following
wordas §5 1525 5.45 3 jointly with Mr. Sroparr, Farapay worked with success on the
alloys of steel. A razor made of one of these alloys, and presented to the present writer
by Farapay himself, is still in his possession.” Unfortunately, all attempts to find
this razor have failed, but TyNpa.t’s appreciation of Farapay’s “ success on the alloys
of steel ” remains.

As will be seen, although Tynpaut highly valued Farapay’s metallurgical researches,
his commendation rests perhaps not so much on the facts mentioned by him, but that
these researches opened up an entirely new field of investigation.

Similarly, the late Professor Sir James Dewar, F.R.S., in an Address delivered at the
Farapay Centenary at the Royal Institution on June 26th, 1891, dealt with the chemical
works of Farapay in relation to modern science and spoke of Farapay’s important
work in connection with the investigation into properties or combinations of steel with
other metals in the course of which he discovered certain important facts.

A careful perusal of Sroparr and Farapay’s second paper, the one read before this
Society, reveals much internal evidence that the work accomplished, as judged by the
standards of previous knowledge and materials, constituted a considerable success and
a marked advance at that time. It is an honour and privilege to have been given the
