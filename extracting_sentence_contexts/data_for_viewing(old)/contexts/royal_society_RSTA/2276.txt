to each measurement outcome. When used in this manner I refer to |W) as a pre-probability, i.e.
something used to generate a probability distribution, as in (3.3), to be carefully distinguished
from the projector [W] = |W)(| that represents a hard-to-interpret quantum property, the weird
‘cat state’.

The CH interpretation treats quantum mechanics, following Born, as a stochastic theory in
which time development must be understood using probabilities. But, as in classical physics,
probabilities require a sample space of mutually exclusive possibilities, one and only one of which
is thought to take place in a particular run of the experiment. In quantum theory, a sample space
is always a PDL. The orthogonality of the projectors ensures that only one, and the fact that they
sum to the identity means at least one, of these possibilities will occur in any particular situation.
In classical physics, the choice of a sample space is usually quite straightforward, and if two or
more spaces are of interest in some situation it causes no difficulty, as one can always combine
them. But in quantum mechanics one needs to make different choices depending on what aspect
of a situation one is interested in. Thus let {P;} and {Q;} be two PDIs for the same system. If and
only if they are compatible,

P)Qk =QkP; for all j and k, (3.4)

can there be a common refinement, a PDI consisting of all the non-zero P;Q;; otherwise they are
incompatible and cannot be combined. The CH approach resolves (or evades or tames) the standard
quantum paradoxes by means of the single framework rule, which prohibits as meaningless those
