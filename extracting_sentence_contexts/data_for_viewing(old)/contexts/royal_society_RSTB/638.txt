sensitive impressions in such a manner, that one lateral half of this substance is suffi-
cient for the two sides of the body, or that the conductors of sensitive impressions
decussate in the spinal cord, so that those which come from the left side of the body

pass into the right side of the spinal cord, and vice versd. The hypothesis of the
Germans may explain the fact: that sensibility persists on the side of the section, but
it is proved to be absolutely inadmissible, by the fact that there is anesthesia on the
opposite side. We will see that the other experiments we have to mention are also
in opposition to the views of the Germans (Stiiuina, Scurrr, and others). On the
contrary, all the facts concur to prove the existence of a decussation.

_ (2) Tf, after having made a first section of a lateral half of the spinal cord in the
dorsal region, on the right side, for instance (see fig. 9, s), and after having ascertained
that the right posterior limb is hyperesthetic, or at least extremely sensitive, we
divide the left lateral half of the spinal cord in the cervical region, we find then that
the right posterior limb loses entirely, or almost entirely, its sensibility. This experi-
ment shows clearly that the sensitive impressions coming from the right posterior
limb, after the first section, passed across the spinal cord from the right into the left
side, along which they were transmitted to the encephalon.

â€œ (3) To obtain a very striking result from the experiment which consists in only one
section of a lateral half of the spinal cord, it is better to make it after the posterior
