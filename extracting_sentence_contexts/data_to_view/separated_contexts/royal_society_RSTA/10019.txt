He attributed the activity of the metal to its power of
condensing the hydrogen and oxygen on its surface; the “
combine at the ordinary temperature. This theory was strongly opposed by

condensed” gases then

Der ta Rive,{ who revived the idea that the metal acts simply as a carrier of oxygen
to the combustible gas, the catalytic process being essentially a series of alternate
oxidations and reductions. In support of the “oxygen” theory, he urged the fact
that when an alternating current is sent through acidulated water between platinum
electrodes, the latter become covered with a fine black powder, produced by the
repeated oxidation and reduction of the metal. He further showed that platinum
foil rendered active by any of Farapay’s methods will absorb oxygen but not
hydrogen. i
