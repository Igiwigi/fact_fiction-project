colour, and form a rounded gelatinous mass at the opening of the oviduct. As
development proceeds the mass expands in all directions, and becomes a more or less
extensive sheet of ova firmly cemented together ; at the same time the colour changes
successively from blue into purple, red, and pink. From the colour a very good idea
can be obtained of the stage of development of the ova, and though a particular tint

suggests that the perforations serve as passages for the spermatozoa.

by no means always indicates precisely the same stage of development, this fact is
exceedingly useful.

In Scalpellum obliquum (12), and apparently in Pollicipes polymerus (49), the
lamellw are yellow. In Dichelaspis Darwinii the ova are vermilion-red (17). In
Chthamalus stellatus, the ova, at first flesh coloured, become bright orange-red, and
the lamelle pass gradually from this colour into paler orange and chrome-yellow. In
Balanus perforatus, the lamells, at first pale yellow, become successively yellowish-
grey and grey. Bovatiius (26) has noted a similar gradation of colour in the Balani
he studied.

In the table, on page 130, the sizes of the ova examined are given, together with a
few measurements previously published. My own measurements refer to the peri-
