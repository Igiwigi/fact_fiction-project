182 LINES OF MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN THE ATLANTIC,

duced magnetism, giving the corrections which, on that hypothesis, and on the further
supposition that the changes in the induced magnetism of the ship were simultaneous
with those of terrestrial magnetism, should have corresponded with the disturbance
on each of the thirty-two points of the compass under every degree of the terrestrial
dip. On examining, by means of this table, the number of degrees of dip by which
it was necessary to go back from the dip at the place of observation, in order to
obtain from the table corrections corresponding to the disturbances at the stations
where the ship was subsequently swung, I find that at Port Praya, where the dip was
+45? 32/, and after a passage of thirty-six days from the British Channel, where the
dip was about +69, that the ship's magnetism, instead of corresponding to a dip of
+452 32, did in fact correspond to a dip of about +51* ; the arrear being about 6?.

At St. Helena, where the dip was about —209, and where the ship had arrived after
a passage of about seventy-nine days from Port Praya, during which she had passed
from north into sonth dip, the arrear was between thirty and forty degrees—the
tabular corrections for 20® north dip corresponding more nearly with the differences
of the azimuths observed at St. Helena with the ship's head on different points, than
did the tabular corrections for 20? south dip ; 80 that the effect of the employment of
the latter would manifestly have been to have increased the evil which they were in-
tended to correct.

At the Cape of Good Hope, where the dip was —53?, and after an interval of thirty-
eight days from her departure from St. Helena, the arrear appears to have been about
