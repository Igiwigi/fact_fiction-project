Grrerira ||, and more recently SuminsK1 and Henerey ** have done the same,
But although neither of these able inquirers succeeded by direct experiment in
proving that the motion of the particles of plants is essential to the act of impregna-
tion, M. HormersTeRFF, and very recently also Mr. Hexrrey$%, have noticed facts
in regard to that of the spermatozoid filaments discovered by Nice and SuUminss1,
in the Cryptogamia, which seem to show that, in plants, it is of great importance to
the function of these bodies. The motion of the spermatozoon in animals has equally
attracted the attention of zoologists. PrEvosT and Dumas {\, as already stated,
SteBoLD, MULLER, WAGNER, Koriiker, BiscHorr, QUATREFAGES, and especially
WaexeR and LEUckaRDrT, have studied it attentively ; but s0 intricate is the inquiry
concerning its nature and import, that the last two authors dismiss the consideration
of the question without arriving at any conelusion, and state that they do not venture
to decide||||.
