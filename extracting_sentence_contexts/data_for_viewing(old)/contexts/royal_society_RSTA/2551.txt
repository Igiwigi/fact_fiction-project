— this composition of proofs is associative,

— for each formula A there is an identity proof id4: A — A such that for f: A > B we have

foida =f =idg of.

Under these assumptions, the proofs are the arrows in a category whose objects are the formulae
of the logic. What remains is to provide the right axioms for the ‘category of proofs’.

It seems that finding these axioms is particularly difficult for the case of classical logic.
Linear logic can be axiomatized by various variants of star-autonomous categories [23-26]. For
intuitionistic logic, a reasonable notion of proof identity is given by the axioms of a Cartesian
closed category [22]. In fact, one can say that the proofs of intuitionistic logic are the arrows in the
free Cartesian closed category generated by the set of propositional variables.

A naive approach for extending this result to classical logic would be to add an involutive
negation to a Cartesian closed category, ie. a natural isomorphism between A and the double-
negation of A. But this immediately gives us a collapse into a Boolean algebra, i.e. any two proofs
f,g: A— Bare identified [22,34]. To overcome this problem, we clearly have to drop some of the
equations that one would like to hold between proofs in classical logic. But which ones should
go? There are now several different approaches, and all have their advantages and disadvantages.

(i) The first says that the axioms of Cartesian closed categories are essential and cannot be
dispensed with. Instead, one sacrifices the duality between A and v. The motivation
for this approach is that a proof system for classical logic can now be seen as an
