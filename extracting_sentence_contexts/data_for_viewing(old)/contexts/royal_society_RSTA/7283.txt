The dimensions and stability of these previous crystallites can therefore be expected to
affect the nucleating conditions in the melt at the lower fusion temperatures. It is demon-
strated later that the stability of the crystallites can be expected to be greater the higher
the temperature of crystallization. We can therefore expect that the previous crystalliza-
tion history of the polymer can effect the subsequent crystallization if the intermediate
fusion temperature is low. In all the measurements made up to this stage, the previous
crystallization history of the polymer was the same in that the crystallization occurred
during the 4 h drying period at 160° C. The effect of the previous crystalline history on the
subsequent crystallization half-times is illustrated by two crystallizations carried out at
241° C from a previous melt temperature of 271° CG, but using polymers previously crystal-
lized at 160 and 240° C. The half-times of crystallization were 68 and 44 min respectively.

The fact that the melting-point of the crystallites in polyethylene terephthalate depends
on the temperature at which they are formed was demonstrated on the hot-stage polarizing
microscope. It was observed that crystalline regions formed at 110° C melted at 256° C,
whereas regions crystallized at 240° C melted at 264° C.

(e) The crystallized polymer structure

Amorphous polyethylene terephthalate is transparent and becomes opaque when crystal-
lized. The degree of opacity depends on the amount of crystallinity and the temperature
of crystallization. If partially crystallized samples crystallized at 110 and 240° G are com-
pared at the same degree of crystallinity, as judged by density, the higher temperature
crystallized samples are more opaque. This indicates a difference in the structure developed
at different temperatures. This is also reflected by the physical properties, the higher
