ZIMMERMANN{ found that a Jamty’s chain, freshly formed in a glass tube, is freely
motile, but after standing develops a high resistance. This was correctly explained
by Srraspurcer} as being due to the spaces between the water-columns becoming
wetted, so that the menisci no longer adhere to the walls and resist movement.
Before this happens the tube passes through an intermediate condition in which
the menisci adhere along portions of their rims only and threads of water pass from
column to column, so that a moderate pressure will cause water to pass the air-
bubbles slowly while these remain stationary, and stronger pressure will drive
the whole chain out. The presence of internal thickenings causes this condition
to appear much earlier in the vessels, as soon, in fact, as the air-bubbles attain a
diameter at all approaching that of the vessel. Indeed, quite small bubbles may
be seen to adhere to the walls when a rapid transpiration current is passing through
vertically-placed vessels, and this is of great importance in preventing the immediate
accumulation of air-bubbles at the upper ends of the vessels.
