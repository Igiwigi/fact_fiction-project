TOMES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

enamels of Marsupials and of Plagiostomes which I no longer consider to hold good
in their entirety. The theory of enamel formation here advanced, whilst reconcilable with the figures
given by Rosx (8), is not quite in accord with the views recently advocated by
Leon Witttams (14), who is of opinion that the enamel prism (or rod as he generally
styles it) is the thing first formed, and that the prisms are at a later stage of the
process fused together by an at first semi-fluid material, which runs in between
them ; whereas the illustrations which accompany this paper would indicate that the
interstitial substance and the peripheries of the prisms are the first things to be formed. And whilst I admire the beauty of his specimens and of the photographs which
illustrate his paper, I cannot help thinking that if he had had Marsupial enamel under
observation, he would have drawn somewhat different conclusions as to the develop-
ment of enamel generally.*

The view that enamel formation essentially consists in the centripetal calcification
of preformed fibres, is applicable to all enamels, and serves to render intelligible many
facts that were otherwise difficult to understand. Tomes’ processes and the existence
of a thin sheet of young enamel, which was perforated, have long been recognised

* Mr. Leon Wituiams (14, i.) writes: “If we look closely at the last layer of developing enamel
shown at d, we shall see that it contains a row of globular bodies of very regular and uniform size.
