Sea ice volume is no longer increased. In
contrast to the Arctic, the influence of the stochastic sea ice parametrization on the mean climate
of the Antarctic is relatively small in the uncoupled model. This can be explained by the fact
that Antarctic sea ice almost completely vanishes during austral summer which inhibits the small
temporal accumulation of stochastic effects. The impact of the stochastic sea ice parametrization on the mean climate of the coupled model
ECHAM6-FESOM turns out to be very different. The mean sea ice volume in the Arctic and
Antarctic remains largely unchanged with the stochastic scheme switched on.
