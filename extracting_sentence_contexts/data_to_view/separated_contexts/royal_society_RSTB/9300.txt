the provision of what are commonly known as ‘primers’ to
enable the basic science to be properly set out in fields
where evidence is common, in terms that can be readily
understood by both judge and jury. Faced with a common approach to the underlying science,
it is far, far easier for the tribunal that decides the issue of fact to
approach the real issue that divides the experts. I have had discussions over the years with the former
Regulator, and others, about the feasibility of producing stan-
dardized documents relating to the most popular areas of
forensic science, presenting the basic science in an accessible,
plain English format. This is what is done to great effect in the
Patent Court and suitably adapted would make a great deal
of difference in the criminal courts.
