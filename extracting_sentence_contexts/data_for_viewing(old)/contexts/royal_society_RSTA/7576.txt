Now van der Merwe (1949) has brought together a good deal of evidence with unifying
calculations which indicates that oriented overgrowth of one substance on another can
only occur if the structures of the massive crystals are well enough matched. There is
a limiting degree of misfit which cannot be exceeded in a given set of conditions. If the
same considerations apply to the growth of a crystalline material on a nucleus of the same
substance, it may be that an important barrier to visible nucleation lies in a misfit between
interatomic spacings in nuclei and grown crystals. The effect of absorption may be to raise
or to lower this barrier. If an inhibiting effect on nuclei of the stable solid phase in a system
is greater than the effect on less stable phases the formation of the latter is made more likely.

In the present set of experiments we have observed that conditions slightly removed from
those which give rise to metastable phases do, in fact, give rise to visible distortion of the

crystal habit of the stable calcite, as Buehrer & Reitemeier (1940) also noted in the case of
precipitation in presence of Calgon; in addition Raistrick (1949) has demonstrated that
structural requirements for an adsorption of Calgon on calcite are met. With respect to
lattice distortion, as revealed by X-rays, we have noticed that calcite may be distorted in
presence of magnesium salts or Calgon, that vaterite is likewise affected, and that calcium
carbonate monohydrate may be distorted. In short, distortion was common under the
conditions of our experiments. With respect to the nature of the distortion our reported
results show that the calcite lattice was contracted due to absorption of magnesium
