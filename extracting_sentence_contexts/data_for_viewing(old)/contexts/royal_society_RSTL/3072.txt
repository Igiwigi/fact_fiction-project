On a suhject of 80 much importance, it is very desirable that the experiments of
M. Macxus should be repeated and verified ; for until this is done, considering the
physiological history of the blood, it will be difficult to ayoid doubt, and to depend on
them with that degree of confidence which is justly due only to well-authenticated facts.

The ingenious apparatus employed by M. Macnus being difficult of construction,
and not easily used excepting in a well-appointed laboratory, I must leave the repeti-
tion of his highly interesting experiments to those inquirers who are more happily
Situated than myself for engaging in them. On the present occasion I shall limit
myself to the detail of some experiments instituted with a view of testing M. Macnus'
general results.

As a solution of potassa has the property of absorbing carbonic acid gas, it follows
that if mixed with the blood previous to being subjected to the air-pump, it will prove
in ome measure a test of the kind of air which the blood is capable of affording.
