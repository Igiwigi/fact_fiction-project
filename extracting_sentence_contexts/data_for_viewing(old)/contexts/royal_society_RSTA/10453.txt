temperature between plates and atmosphere be very considerable or very slight, the

same effect is produced. A thick piece of glass held in the hand for 30 seconds and

then placed in the dust atmosphere will have a figure deposited upon it, but the
anount of deposit will be small and the figure faint. The figures form best between

certain limits of temperature, and when there is a marked difference between the

plate and the surrounding atmosphere. They are very sensitive to change of
temperature ; in fact, to get a perfect cross or other figure, both plate and atmosphere
must each be uniformly heated. If, in addition to uniformly heating a plate, a
warmed body be placed below it and kept there during the time that the dust is
depositing, there is a considerable increase in the amount of deposit and a modification
of the figure formed ; for instance, if a copper cylinder, 12 millims. in diameter and
14 millims. high, heated to 55Â°, be placed 30 millims. below the centre of a square
plate, then the figure shown in fig. 9 is produced. If a piece of glass be only warmed
by holding it in the hand, and is then placed immediately below the plate, but not
touching it, a marked and peculiar effect on the cross is produced, as seen in fig. 10.
If this heating below the plate be increased, either by raising the temperature of the
small copper cylinder, or by using taller cylinders, so as to bring the source of heat
nearer to the plate, the amount of deposit is increased, and ultimately the figure of
