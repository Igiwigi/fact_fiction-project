Pulmonary oedema and loss of
cardiac elasticity would then occur much later. Of course in other cases, as when,
for example, the greatest amount of blood which could be forced out from the left
ventricle in a systole was to be sought, or the work done by the left ventricle under
varying conditions, it would be necessary to use the wide tubes and stopcocks which
I have above described, and these would almost necessarily lead to the use of other
than Dogs' blood for the nourishment of the isolated heart. Fourth, as a final remark before proceeding to give experiment protocols, I call
attention to the fact that in the following tables it will be seen that now and then a
slight rise of temperature occurs in the course of a cooling experiment, or a slight fall
in the course of a heating. Such breaks were nearly always due to the necessity of
changing the feeding MartorrE's flasks from time to time. While C is emptying and
D filling, ib is nob possible to ensure that when D is in burn connected with the
heart, the blood in it shall always be exactly of snch temperature as to fit into the
series of cooling or heating observations which had been carried on with C. An
endeavour was always made to make the observations with the alternate flasks
regularly consecutive as regards changes of temperature, and ib will be seen that, in
mos cases, this was attained.
