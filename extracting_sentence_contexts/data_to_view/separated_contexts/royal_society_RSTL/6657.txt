Yet the beans of
gave more than three times as much organic matter in the produce as was con-
in the seed, and they appropriated even a much larger proportion of the Nitrogen
of the seed than did those of 1857. The result with the' peas was not s0 satisfactory,
owing to the less healthy character and the more limited amount of their growth. From the fact that these Leguminous plants did not go through a complete course of
h to the flowering process, it may be objected that hence they did not pass certain
5 ub of growth in which they might possibly assimilate free Nitrogen. We shall refer
Ato this objection again further on. At present we confine attention to the important,
Zfuct, that active growth has taken placeâ€”that the process of cell-formation, with the
S accompanying one of the decomposition of carbonic acid and the fixation of carbon, has
=gone forward with a deficient supply of combined Nitrogen, and in the immediate pre-
ence of free Nitrogen, and yet none of it has been assimilated.
