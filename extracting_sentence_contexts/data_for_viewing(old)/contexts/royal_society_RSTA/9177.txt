& = connected. The table contains a comparison of the spectra of Neon in the ordinary
& discharge and from the bulb, the gas containing a little Hydrogen. The enlarged
= length of the wedge was 42 mm. Only the stronger lines in the red and yellow have
e been subjected to examination, and if series exist in the spectrum, their leading
“3 members in the red and yellow should decrease considerably in intensity in the bulb,

3 but on the whole, less considerably towards the yellow—provided that Neon behaves
: like Hydrogen and Helium.

6 There is a preponderance of small ratios in the case of the very strong lines, and the
larger ratios are in general for the smaller wave-lengths, while the two smallest wave-
lengths examined show enhancement, which is not found elsewhere in the list. These
facts give some support to the view that a complicated system of series may be
present. If, on the other hand, the spectrum is more in the nature of a band, as in
