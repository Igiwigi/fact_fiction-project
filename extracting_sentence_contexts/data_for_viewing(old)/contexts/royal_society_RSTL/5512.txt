We might construct curves of the values thus found, which must express the relation
Sxisting between the catalytic action and the substance and mass of the contact-body.
ur experiments are, however, as yet not extended enough to enable us here to enter
Dore fully into this new field of research.

Our experiments have led us to another very singular relation, which is of great in-
terest as playing an important, part in the whole of the phenomena of photo-chemical
induction. 'The normal gas from which all light has been excluded, needs, as we have
shown, a certain length of exposure before the maximum action is attained. The
length of exposure is not altered when the pure gas is allowed to stand for some time in
the dark before insolation. If, however, the gas contains such minute traces of impuri-
ties that the maximum action is not thereby lessened, we still find evidences of the pre-
sence of these admixtures in the fact, that on standing in the dark the time required for
the attainment of the maximum induction is considerably shortened. This phenomenon

admixture (only to be estimated as millionths of the whole mass) have become 80 small
