STATISTICAL ESTIMATION 335

dice, etc. Theoretically, however, the situation is clear: when we speak of a
random sample we mean that it is drawn so that (1) the probability of each
individual of the population being included in the sample is the same, and (2) separate
drawings are mutually independent, except in the case of dependence resulting from
the population being finite, when the individual drawn is not returned to the
population before the next drawing. Leaving apart on one side the practical difficulty of achieving randomness and the
meaning of this word when applied to actual experiments, I want to call attention
to the fact that the conditions of the problem in (ia) may be mathematically described

as follows. S Denote X, Y, ..., Z, the characters of the individuals of the population =, in
iy which we are interested and by x, y,.. . . z, respectively the values of these characters

"gcorresponding to some particular individual.
