perception, consciousness, probability One motivation for treating neural representations as probabilistic is that neurons

are stochastic devices: identical inputs to identical neurons will inevitably yield
Author for correspondence: variation in firing patterns. That applies to all neural representation, but there is
Ned Block a reason to expect perceptual representation, in particular, to be probabilistic
because, given any activation of a perceptual system, there are many different
environmental situations with different perceptible properties that could have
produced it, some more probable than others. The visual system is said to cope
with these facts by representing many of the possible environmental situations,
each with a certain probability [1,2]. Perceptual representation of a range of
environmental situations, each with a certain probability, is what is meant in
this article by ‘probabilistic representation’.

For example, Vul et al. say that’. . . that internal representations are made up of
multiple simultaneously held hypotheses, each with its own probability of being
correct...’ [3]. Gross & Flombaum [4] describe ‘...a growing body of work that
emphasizes the probabilistic nature of the computations and representations
involved in a perceiver’s attempts to “infer” the distal scene from noisy signals
and then store the representations it constructs’. They advocate probabilistic rep-
resentations in which perceptual properties are attributed to places or things with
a certain probability.
