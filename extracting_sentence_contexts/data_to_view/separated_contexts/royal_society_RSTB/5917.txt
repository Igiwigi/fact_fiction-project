As may be seen from fig. 36, the “ units’? do not completely fill the compartments in
which they lie ; they may project more or less freely from one of the enclosing walls or they
may extend across the middle part of a compartment. Spaces are thus left around
them, and it is these which give to the tissue its characteristic vacuolated appearance. Nowhere else in the Primates has an ectoplacental trophoblast of this peculiar type
been found to occur, and equally remarkable is the fact that the part of the trophoblast
of the blastocyst concerned in its formation and corresponding to the cytotrophoblast
of the ectoplacental area in the higher Primates is completely used up in its formation
by the time the blastocyst has reached a diameter of + 0-5 mm., so that the tropho-
blastic mass must depend for its further growth on its own inherent capacity. Moreover,
once it is established, it never exhibits the invasive properties we associate with this
layer in the higher Primates. Apart from sending out basally a stalk-like process, and
apart from a noteworthy increase in size, its growth-activity is.of the non-invasive order.
