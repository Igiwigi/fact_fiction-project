In group (a) we notice a tendency to increased reflex action. Tn this particular it,
agrees with ammonium, but differs from members of the alkaline group. We have
already noted that, in s0ome members of the alkaline group, a slightly increased reflex
action might be observed at the commencement of the poisoning, but this is consider-
ably less than in the case of most of the members of group (a), with the exception of
barinm. Excitement of the spinal cord is most marked in poisoning by beryllimn ;
next come strontium and calcium ; and lastly barium, in which excitement, if present,
at all, is very slight.

In group (b) reflex action in the cord is not increased, nor does it appear to be very
much diminished till the last. In this group, however, the higher centres appear to be
paralyzed. We infer this from the fact that yttrium greatly diminishes co-ordinating
power in the Frog, rendering the movements ataxic, and causing the animal to lie with
the legs fully stretched out, although neither musele or nerve is paralyzed. Didy-
mium, erbium, and lanthanum all have a similar action.

In regard to their action on motor nerves, we notice the same well marked division
into two groups as in their general action : beryllium, calcium, strontium, and barium
all paralyzing the motor nerves to some extent. Lanthanum has also a paralyzing
action, but yttrium, didyminm, and erbium have none. In this respect these three
bodies agree with 8odium and rubidium, and differ from all the others belonging to
these two groups which we have examined.

In regard to their action upon musele, we do not find that these bodies can be
