The ORR activity of the catalyst carbonized at 800째C was higher than that of the catalyst
carbonized at 700째C, although the former showed the highest active pyridinic N content as
well as the highest specific surface area. Therefore, it is likely that the increase in the electrical
conductivity owing to the formation of graphitic carbon and the increase in the relative amount of
Fe3C present also raised the ORR activity. This is supported by the fact that the amount of charge
during ORR at 0 rpm in the range between 0.6 and 1.0 V (versus RHE) shown in the electronic
supplementary material, table S4 was the largest in the catalyst calcined at 800째C. Figure 8a shows TEM images of the carbon material with an Fe/N/SD ratio of 2:10:10 after
HTC and the catalysts formed by its carbonization at 700, 800 and 900째C. The dark areas contain
Fe and graphitic structures, such as graphite shell chains, in keeping with a previous report [9].
