By means of (11.2), (11.19) we may express I’ as a power series
in the 2, %. Since the ¢,, «, vanish with (« — v) and the z,, u,, and the series involved
in the transformations (11.2), (11.19) are uniformly convergent, we may make the
||, |@,| arbitrarily small by taking |o —v|, |%|, || sufficiently small. Using this
fact, together with the absolute convergence of the transformations, we see that F
becomes a power series in the z,, «, with coefficients which are series in (¢ — v), ye”,
absolutely convergent when I’, = |ye"| =P, and jo — v|, |%|, || are sufficiently
small. Thus F is regular} in the neighbourhood of any periodic solution of Family 1
sufficiently near the generating solution. By using similar methods we may construct the normalising contact transformation
appropriate to a generating solution of Family II or III, and that appropriate to a
periodic solution of Family I or II when a =0 or A=0 or 4=}4y, and we may
similarly establish the convergence of the series here involved and the regularity of F
in the neighbourhood of such a periodic solution.
