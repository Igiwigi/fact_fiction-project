yards and a half, destroying the fine woods and dwellings.

It also avails little to mention the great mortality which prevailed among the cattle.
Thousands perished, and those which after the eruption reached the abodes of men,
presented sad spectacles ; their bodies in many instances being one mass of scorched
flesh.

Within the bay of Fonseca, and two miles from the volcano, it is stated that two
islands have been thrown up, of from 200 to 300 yards in length, their surface, but a
few yards above the sea, presenting, it is said, a mass of scoria and ashes : their
elevation has probably been caused by the heavy fall of scoriaceous matter on shoals
previously existing in those places. However probable, the evidence is not conclusive,
although the fact of the beach on the eastern or inner side of the promontory being
extended by the ashes about 800 feet further out, gives additional reason to credit
the statement.

On the 3rd of March, nearly two months after this great eruption, the volcano re-
mained in a state of activity, but not ejecting ashes. By some geologists it has been
considered that heayy eruptions of fine scoriaceous matter tend, by their falling again
into the crater, to restore the volcano to a quiescent state, and that therefore this
phenomenon more usually attends the conclusion of an explosion. In this particular
instance it appears that the first effect of the explosion was to blow out of the crater,
and finely triturate, the scoria and ashes left there twenty-six years before.
