** Mercury alloyed with any number of metals takes the place in the scale of E.
of the most electro-positive metal it may contain, if the amount of the electro-positi
metal present is not less than about 75549009 in weight of the mercury,‚Äù

necessary that the mercury should either be alloyed with a sensible, though
relatively very small, portion of zinc, or else protected with mercurous sulp|
With pure mercury without paste nob only is the E.M.F. variable from hour to
but it can scarcely be said to be definite even at a particular time--that is, it

have no effect whatever upon a properly constibuted cell. Sometimes when the
galvanometer contact was made, a throw of the needle was observed, not followed
by any corresponding permanent deflection, the cell in fact behaving like a charged
condenser. '

In the absence of paste a very 8mall addition of zine to mercury gives it a
definite and tolerably permanent character. If, however, there be any mereurons
sulphate, even though originally in another leg of an H-cell, the mercury is gradually
repurified. To this cause is to be attributed the gradual fall to zero of the E.M.F.
of the cells (F) and (G) above considered.

Indeed, the whole tendency of these observations is to snggest that the action of
the mercurous sulphate may be secondary, rather than primary ; 80 that if zine could
be opposed to really pure mereury, no mercurous sulphate would be needed in a CLARK
cell, It may be, however, that in that case a minute quantity of mercurous sulphate
