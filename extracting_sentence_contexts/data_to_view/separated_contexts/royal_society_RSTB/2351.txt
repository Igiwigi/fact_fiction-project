13, which represents
part of another “seed,” in similar section. The presence of this laminar margin
exactly agrees with what we found in the corresponding region of the non-integu-
mented specimens, (Fig 2, 1.) The fact is important, because it proves that the
integument is not merely the incurved lamina of the sporophyll, folding round the
sporangium, and forming a kind of false indusium, but is really a new formation
growing up from the upper surface of the sporophyll. In the more proximal part of
the pedicel, where the base of the integument corresponds with the margin of the
sporophyll, either interpretation might hold good, but the structure in the distal
region proves that integument and lamina are quite distinct organs. The section
