Tt is conceivable
that, from either of these canses, sufficient heat may be accumulated with almost
instantaneous rapidity, in some portion of the mass struck, to develope sudden chemical
change*. The circumstance, that the detonation of those portions of an explosive
compound (such as gun-cotton or. nitroglycerine) which are immediately between the
surfaces of the hammer and the support is not communicated to the surrounding por-
tions, may be ascribed to a combination of two causes, the instantaneous nature of the
explosion, and the close confinement of the portions struck at the instant of their
explosion. 'The mechanical effect of the detonation is absorbed by the masses of metal
between which it occurred, and the gases deyeloped disperse the surrounding portions
of the explosive agent, as they rush away from between the two surfaces. Tt is possible
also to detonate gunpowder and other explosive mixtures by a blow in such a manner
that only the portions immediately struck are ignited; but those substances may also
be exploded, though much less violently, by a less sudden or powerful application of
force, in which case they detonate much more feebly; their explosion is accompanied
by a larger volume of flame, and by the ignition of those portions which surround the
part struck by the hammer,

The exceedingly violent motion of particles resulting from the sudden or extremely
rapid transformation of a solid or liquid explosive body into highly expanded gas or
vapour, must obyiously exert a force which operates upon a resisting body, in the
vicinity, in a manner precisely similar to the force applied by opposing a body in the

* In illustration of the effect of friction of particles of a mass against each other in determining the develop-
ment of an explosion, the following experiment may be quoted, A. yery porous pellet of a mixture of potassic
chlorate and amorphous phosphorus (carefully purified from ordinary phosphorus) was placed between two
polished metal plates, and a someyhat rapidly accumulating pressure was then applied ; the mass exploded

almost, directly, before, in fact, snflicient force had been expended to conyert the loose aggregate of particles
into a compact mass. A second similar pellet, also placed between two polished surfaces, was submitted to

prexaure very gradually and carefully applied, and was thus converted into a compact mass without being

exploded; on afterwards submitting this to rapidly increasing pressure precisely as in the first experiment, a

much more considerable accumulation of force was required to accomplish the explosion of the mass. THE HISTORY OF EXPLOSIVE AGENTS. 503
