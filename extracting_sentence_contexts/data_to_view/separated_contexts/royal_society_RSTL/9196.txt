These latter vibrations we might expect not to take place in fixed periods, but
to produce what we call a continuous spectram. We may suppose that at the lowest temperature at
which, for instance, oxygen is luminous, the vibrations in the ether are chiefly produced by this rapid
relative motion of different molecules, while at higher temperatures the relative motions of different
portions of one molecule might have the upper hand; the continuous spectrum in one case, and the line
spectrum in the other, might thus be explained. I admit that there is much to be aid in favour of this view, and must leave to further experimentation
to decide whether it is the one most accordant with facts or not. That the discontinuous spectra of
different orders (line and band spectra) are due to different molecular combination, T consider to be
pretty well established, and analogy has led me (and Mr. Lockygr before me) to explain the continuous
spectra by the same canse ; for the change of the continuous spectrum to the line or band spectrum takes
Place in exactly the smne way as the change of spectra of different orders into each other. Analogy is
nob a strong guide, yet s0me weight may be given to it in a case like the one under discussion, where
experiment hitherto has failed to give a decided answer.
