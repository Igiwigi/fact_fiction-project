CYSTICERCUS OELLULOSA, AS FOUND IN THE MUSCLES OF THE PIG. 125

portee. At first they were very small white bodies having none of the marks of Cysticerci ;
they afterwards enlarged, assumed an oblong shape, and, piercing through the substance
of the liver, escaped into the peritoneal cavity ; then, in a thickening which appeared at
the fore-part of the very simple vermiform body, was developed the characteristic head
of the Cysticercus with its suctorial disks and circlet of hooks. No trace of the six
embryo-hooks could be detected in connexion with the Cysticerci. These observations
of LEVCKART were published in 1855, and were not known to the author when he first
communicated his researches to the Royal Society in the 8xummer of that year. Allow-
ing for differences not unlikely to modify the process in different cases, the facts observed
by LEUCKART are in no way irreconcileable with the conclusions arrived at in this paper ;
and after due consideration of the present state of knowledge concerning the relations
subisting between the Tape-worm and Cysticercus, the author sees no reason to distrust
the evidence on which he has represented the Cysticereus cellulose as immediately deve-
loped from a peculiar vermiform animal, whatever be the mode in which the latter may
be derived from a Tenia-embryo.

Finally, the facts made known in this communication may perhaps serve to throw
light on the nature of certain bodies of an ambiguous description observed by Vox Hrss-
LING* to be occasionally present in the muscular tissue of the heart of the Ox, Sheep,
and Roe Deer. These objects appear under the form of oval aggregations of granules of
a peculiar kind, enclosed in an outer capsule and parted into several smaller masses some-
