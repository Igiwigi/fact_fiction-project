daughter it is much easier, although still laborious, to trace back her ancestry, and
find the number of her brothers and sisters. Even in this case the search may be
lengthy. But as daughters when married change their name, it requires great care
in extracting large quantities to be sure that a mother is not repeated, 7.¢., some
approach made to weighting her with her fertility. Every care was made in
extracting the records, but we cannot hope to have always avoided weighting to
some extent a mother, and if this be done we shall have a transition from formule
(xi.), (v.), and (i.) towards formule (xv.), (vii.), and (viii.), which would well account
for the difference found between theory and observation.

If we sum up for inheritance of fertility in the female line on the basis of these
four cases, we draw from each one of them the unquestionable result that fertility in
woman is an inherited character. Further, the more we remove causes of fictitious
values for the fertility in either generation, the closer does the value approach that
required by the law of ancestral heredity. The two chief disturbing factors which
we have not been able to eliminate are (a.) the age at which marriage is entered
upon, (b.) restraint giving a fictitious value to the fertility. Both these causes must
give a lessened value to the correlation of fertility between mother and daughter,
and the first, judging from the great influence of age at marriage on fertility, cannot
fail to give a serious diminution. Hence if we find the regression coefficient as high
as ‘2238, when we neglect these factors, it is no stretching of facts to conclude that
it would in all probability rise to ‘3 could we take them into account.

Our conclusion, therefore, is that fertility in woman is certainly inherited through
the female line, and most probably according to the law of ancestral heredity.
