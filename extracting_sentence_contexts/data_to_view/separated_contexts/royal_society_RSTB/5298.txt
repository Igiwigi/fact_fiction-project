These times were reckoned from when the seed was sown; the plants were then about
an inch above the soil. These bodies were more or less spherical and they possessed no
flagellum, but in the centre of each was a nucleus with a well-marked central karyosome
(see Plate 21, fig. 5). The nucleus was, in fact, identical with that found in plasmodia. These bodies had the power of slow amceboid movement, and were able in this way to
travel up the root hair. Root hairs were not, as a rule, attacked until they had
attained about a third of their mature length.
