the development of an unsteady wake) and the forcing is calculated using Morisonâ€™s equation in
which the water particle kinematics are based upon the incident wavefield, ignoring the presence
of the body. Similarly, estimates of the maximum crest elevation, to assess over-topping rates or
the provision of an effective air-gap, are also based upon the incident wavefield. By contrast, if
the body is large (D/A => 0.2) the flow lies within the linear diffraction regime and a significant
disturbance of the incident wavefield is expected. This disturbance takes the form of a radially
propagating wavefield, the frequency of which is directly related to that of the incident waves.
In this case, both the applied forces and the maximum crest elevation must include the effects of
the scattered waves. At the boundary between these regimes (drag-inertia and linear diffraction),
defined by low KC numbers, the inertia loading and (weak) wave scattering correspond to the
long wavelength limit of linear diffraction.

Unfortunately, this simplistic view does not take into account the fact that the incident waves
may be nonlinear, perhaps highly nonlinear, and that diffraction will be more complicated than
that implied by a simple linear solution. Indeed, the purpose of this study was to examine whether
there exists some intermediate flow regime in which little linear diffraction occurs but, with steep
incident waves, alternative mechanisms lead to the unexpected scattering of nonlinear or high-
frequency waves. Within such a regime, it is possible that the formal perturbation expansions,
on which diffraction solutions typically rely, are unable to resolve the underlying physics. This


will be particularly apparent if the incident waves are steep and the mechanisms responsible for
the scattered waves introduce new time-scales that no longer relate to integer multiples of the
incident wave frequency.
