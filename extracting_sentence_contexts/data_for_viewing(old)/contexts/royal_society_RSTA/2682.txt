The next design approach which can be used to limit solid fouling is tuning the physical
properties of the surface, specifically its elastic modulus. In the case of a rigid material adhered to
an elastic surface, the strength of that adhesive bond is proportional to both the work of adhesion
and the elastic modulus, E, of the surface material by the relationa Â« ./W,E/t, where t is the film
thickness [19-21]. The rationale for this is that the total energy of a surface consists of both its
elastic strain energy (a proportional function of modulus) and its interfacial free energy [19,21].
When the de-bonding of a contaminant from a surface involves the macro-scale deformation
of the surface, as in a rigid material de-bonding from an elastic surface, this elastic strain can
significantly increase the overall surface energy. Minimizing the elastic strain energy of the surface
by reducing its modulus lowers the equilibrium barrier for fracture of the adhesive interface
[21]. Therefore, by lowering the modulus of the surface material, the adhesion of solid fouling
materials can be reduced dramatically. In fact, while the interfacial free energy difference between
smooth surfaces of a high energy metal such as iron (2.4J m~*) [22] and the lowest energy material
Coo Faz (0.0067 J m=?) [23] is only a factor of 100, the modulus between a hard and soft surface
can vary over as many as 5 orders of magnitude [24,25]. Thus, when bulk deformation occurs,
