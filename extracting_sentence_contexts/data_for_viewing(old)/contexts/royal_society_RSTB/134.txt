to indicate a predisposition to tubercular disease in a certain proportion of the
individuals, quite apart from general constitutional weakness. Under good hygienic
conditions the great majority of these will escape altogether. Under medium con-
ditions a large proportion will survive the tubercular diseases of childhood, but only
to fall victims to phthisis later on in life. Under the worst conditions most will die
of tubercular disease during childhood. So few will survive that, although a larger
proportion of them will die than of the survivors under medium conditions, yet the
death-rate from phthisis on the whole population in the worst houses will be less.

The fact that the mortality from croupous pneumonia increases so markedly from
four- to two-roomed houses, and out of all proportion to the death-rate above childhood,
is an important confirmation of the theory of its being caused by micro-organisms.
The fact that it is rather less fatal in one- than in two-roomed houses is due probably
to the fact that it is to a very large extent treated in the Infirmary, where very many
recover who would certainly die at home,

It is not within the scope of this paper to discuss at length the methods which

dwellings; but the following suggestions, as the result of experience, may not be
