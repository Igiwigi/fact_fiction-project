There is, in fact, no evidence that the silver particles are complete spherulites ; an
optical figure such as that observed would be produced by a conical section of a
spherulite, having its apex on the glass surface, for instance, in a way recalling a
single “ set’ in a smectic liquid-crystal layer ; or by a half of a complete sphere.
It appears, however, that an arrangement of rod-like units radiating from a centre
would account for our observations, these rods were birefringent. Suggestions as
to how this may be possible with a substance normally arranged in a cubic lattice
will be made when the results are discussed.

Particles showing this characteristic optical figure are of general occurrence as the
first stage of crystallization, both in silver and in gold films. The possible suggestion
that the birefringence is due to strain in the film, which has been freely invoked to
account for the electrical properties, is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear
in large numbers along any free edge of the film such as that bordering a scratch
made by a needle-point through the film, see figs. 7, af, Plate 14 . Further, as will
be shown later, they can be produced in densely packed masses by the heat-treatment
of a mercury amalgam, where the film can have no mechanical strength. They are
quite independent of the supporting surface, appearing in exactly the same way on
optical glass, quartz glass, and the natural crystal faces of diamond and mica. Still
more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large (111) face of a silver
crystal has been formed by heating, as discussed later, and a second film of silver
deposited on it by sputtering, then, on reheating, this second film gives rise to
particles on the crystal face, which have the same appearance and properties as
those on the surfaces just mentioned. Such particles on a silver crystal face are shown
in figs. 14, 15, 29, 30, Plates 15 and 17.
