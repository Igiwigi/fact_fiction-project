In this case there was no possibility of condensation of vapour on the lower part of
the tube, while previously, when readings were begun at the largest volume, con-
densation might have taken place on the lower part of the tube. If, therefore, the
high vapour-densities are due to adhesion and condensation, the value of this reading
at 40° should be lower than it was found in the first series. This is in fact the case,
as is shown by the following determinations :—

first series, 149°1, is a little more than twice as great as the largest volume in the
second; therefore, as the tube was cylindrical, the surface on which condensation
could take place was about twice as great. If the condensation is not much affected
by the rise of pressure from 19°15 millims. at the largest volume of the first series to
42-05 millims. at the largest volume of the second, and if the high vapour-density is
entirely due to condensation, we should expect the error to be about half as great
in the second as in the first series, and this is approximately the case.
