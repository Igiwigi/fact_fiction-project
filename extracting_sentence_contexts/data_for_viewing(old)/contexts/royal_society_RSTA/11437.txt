neighbourhood of a stove. The first column may be considered to represent the
average humidity of bones preserved in a museum ; the last column complete dryness.
It seems to me that the difference between the first and third column is what we in
general have to deal with. In this case we have a difference of

between dry and humid bones,

The difference between this result for the femur and Broca’s is very considerable.
I think it is due to the fact that he allowed his bones to dry for 24 hours in a room
before measuring them. I was much impressed by the rapidity with which the bones
dried, and their conditions, of course, are very unlike what they would be if containing
or surrounded by animal matter. It is clear that the extensions due to humidity are
not by any means proportional to the length of the bone, and it would be quite futile
to attempt any percentage allowance for the extension due to this cause, the effect of
which clearly differs with the different structure of different parts of the same bone.
T have accordingly thought it best to subtract the above quantities from RoxuEr’s
means, My, My, Mu, and Mx, and to consider the results so derived as giving the
means of Roiet’s material on the supposition that the bones were dry and free from
animal matter. Even so [ do not think we shall err in over-estimating the difference
between the lengths of living and dead bone. Making allowances (a) and (b) we
have finally to subtract from Rotuer’s results for
