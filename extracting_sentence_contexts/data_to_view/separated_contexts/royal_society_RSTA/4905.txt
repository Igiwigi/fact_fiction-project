Here again the conics are obvious, although in this case only some of the lines show
the corresponding absorption conics. Note also that the conics occur in pairs with one component
much weaker than the other. This arises from the fact that the X-rays used consisted of two close
wavelengths, referred to as Ka, and Ka, rather than a single wavelength. The real importance of such photographs is in the fact that very high sensitivity in the study of
lattice parameters can be obtained especially from the places where the conics cross, giving well-
defined points of intersection. The distances between intersections can be measured very precisely
and are very sensitive to small changes in the lattice dimensions.
