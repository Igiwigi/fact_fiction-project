occurs in growths which begin as gametophytic buds, and many of which retain their
prothalloid characters.

The conditions under which these cultures were made, was described in an early
part of this paper. No endeavour was made to isolate the effect of the individual
factors, but some general conclusions may be drawn, as to the relation existing
between the results obtained and the nature of the conditions, which may suggest
more accurate experimental work.

The series of cultures of Nephrodium Filia-mas shows that no necessary con-
nection between cresting of the plant and apogamy exists. But though this
statement is justified in view of the number of instances of apogamy now known in
normal ferns, we are not iv a position to decide that the fact, that nearly all the
prothalli investigated were derived from crested plants, has been without influence
on the results. It may be that prothalli of normal forms of these species will be
found to behave similarly under like conditions. But it appears not improbable that

the variability of the fern plant, as indicated by the crested condition of its fronds,
predisposed to the more or less ready occurrence of apogamy. Of the more direct
causes two can be indicated. The prevention of fertilisation stands in somewhat the
same relation to the occurrence of apogamy as “ sporal arrest” has been shown to
hold in certain cases of apospory.* Further, the influence of direct illumination on
