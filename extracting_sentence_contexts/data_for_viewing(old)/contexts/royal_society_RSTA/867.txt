The grand goal of experimental physics is clear: demonstrate superpositions of macroscopic D8
objects. But, in some sense, that has already been done. For example, one routinely superposes : re
and entangles entire spools of optical fibres. True, each spool of fibre contains only about one : 2
excitation, i.e. one photon. Gas cells [42], optical crystals [43], superconducting qubits [44], :3
among others, have been shown to satisfy the superposition principle in ways similar to the 8
optical fibre spools; see, also, large molecules [45], atoms and photons in a cavity [46] and nano- a

mechanical oscillators [47]. Hence, before we can work on the grand goal, we need to understand
what ‘macroscopic’ means (see, e.g., our review [48] and the many references therein). More
precisely, we need to understand what it means for an object to be macroscopic and quantum
in meaningful ways. This is the grand goal for theoretical physics. We do not expect a single good
measure; macroscopic quantumness has many facets, indeed. But there is a need for structuring
these facts and combining the macro side with the quantum side in relevant figures of merit.
There is already some literature on this, but quite disconnected from experiments. There are
also some experiments, like those mentioned above and even more, but usually disconnected
from abstract theoretical concepts. Technology is ready; we can now work in good synergy
between experiments and theory towards the grand goals. This is the main message of this
paper.

Mathematical physics has also a role to play, probably in providing useful tools to quantify the
relation between the various measures of macroscopic quantumness and decoherence. Another
goal is to improve our understanding of non-Markovian evolutions of open quantum systems.
Indeed, the better we isolate large quantum systems, the more likely it is that the remaining
interactions with the environment lead to non-Markovian effects.
