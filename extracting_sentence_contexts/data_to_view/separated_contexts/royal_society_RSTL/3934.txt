This consideration helps to explain the great comparative
intensity which the dispersed beam possesses under such cireumstances. EPIPOLIC DISPERSION OF LIGHT. 153

As it has been clearly shown that a beam of white light from which certain
rays have been separated by epipolic dispersion is no longer susceptible of producing
the epipolic phenomena, it would seem a natural and almost a necessary conclu-
sion, that the rays 80 separated ought to be wholly, or in a very high degree, 80
dispersed when incident on an epipolizing surface. But the whole history of physical
optics is one continued warning against such seeming logical conclusions ; and in
this case also the conclusion is not horne out by fact. Thus in Exp. 2 and 4, abun-
dance of rays internally dispersed must of necessity have been incident on the new
surface presented to them, yet no fresh dispersion whatever took place. I may add
too that in experiments made with considerable care to exclude all other light from
incidence on a quiniferous surface, but such as had originated in epipolic dispersion,
I have not succeeded in obtaining any indication of their susceptibility of being a
second time 80 dispersed.
