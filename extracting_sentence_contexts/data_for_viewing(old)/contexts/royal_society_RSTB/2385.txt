of the present paper) were sent me by Mr. Lomax as long ago as September, 1897.
The specimen (derived from the Lower Coal-Measures, at Hough Hill, Lancashire) is a
strobilus, of ordinary Lepidostroboid organisation, each sporophyll bearing a single
large sporangium on its upper surface. The structure will be described fully below ;
-here it will be sufficient to say that the only essential difference from known Lepi-
dostrobi consists in the presence of a single large megaspore in each sporangium,
nearly filling the cavity, but accompanied by the remains of its abortive sister-cells.
A series of sections, cut from the same block, showed a number of seed-like specimens
clearly referable to the Cardiocarpon anomalum of WILLIAMSON, associated with
detached sporophylls and sporangia, identical with those of the new cone. The
latter was itself regarded by Mr. Lomax as belonging to Cardiocarpon. The
sporangia borne on the strobilus, however, differed conspicuously from the “seeds ”
of Wixir1aMson’s Cardiocarpon, in the fact that they were without any integument,
a character of essential importance, on which the identification of W1LLIAMson’s

specimens as seeds to a great extent depends. Thus, in spite of the close agreement
in detail between the nucellus of the one and the sporangium of the other, and
though realising the possibility that an integument might grow up, at a later stage,
around the sporangium, I was for a long time unwilling to draw the startling con-
clusion that a Lepidostrobus (for such the new cone essentially was) bore seeds,
identical with a “ Cardiocarpon.” Other specimens, received during 1898-1899,
did not remove this initial difficulty, and it was not till January 22nd, 1900, that I
received what could be accepted as finally convincing evidence. This was afforded

* Quite different, however, as will be shown below, from the true Cardiocarpon anomalum of
