But as 2 F(z) from (1.), it follows that
dy=-de +Y-as
=codr+F(z).t,

which being integrated in the usual manner, substituting at the same time for F(s) its

value, gives

g=ar+C+yploga)tFpls))

Between these equations, if we eliminate «, we have then the integral of equation (3.).

2, From equation (4.) we see that a=; ; and if we represent by « the velocity of the

particle whose place is y, we find
u=Y=0+p logs,
=C+/Þ log(®) -

and * eg We.

3. To determine the arbitrary constant C, we observe that e=g, and u=C are always
simultaneous equations. But the former belongs to the confines of the wave, where in
fact u=0; and therefore C=0. Hence for a wave transmitted through a medium which
is itself at rest beyond the limits of the wave, we have these equations*:—

g=arty/plog.t+e(s) =
0=ar+y/ pt+ap(s) |

* If - and « be eliminated between the equations (7.) and u=+ 4 log a, we shall obtain the equation

u=f{y—wXv pt,

which was first obtained, though in a very different manner from that employed in this paper, by M. Pors80x,
and printed in the Journal of the Polytechnique School, tome yii.
