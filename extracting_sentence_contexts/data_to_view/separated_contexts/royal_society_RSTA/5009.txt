'= This, of course, is plotted, virtually, by the inclination of the curve upon the plate,
& the ordinates all being supposed as lengthened in the ratio 1 to 48°56. 3 The line above this, p = 071800, shows a rapid upward curvature below 35°; liquid
3 in fact was present up to 18°5. Nothing being accurately known as to the specific
F heat of the saturated vapour, we cannot safely assume anything as to the course of
2 events between the 13° and 35° points. A theoretical point obtained from the curve
A of Part IL, at the initial temperature 15°, lies on the prolongation of the experiments
at the upper temperature.
