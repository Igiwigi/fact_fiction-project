turgor or water-charge of the protoplasgm of the excitable cells. The displacement of
water occasioned by this discharge must unquestionably be attended by electrical
change. In Dionza the mechanical effect of an excitation can be 8een from one to
two minutes after the moment, at which the excitation takes place. It is at the same
moment that the 8econd phase, or after effect, begins. In their origin, culmination,
Progress, and duration the two changes are closely associated. Tt therefore appears
extremely probable that the two are causally related—that the positivity of the external
Surface is an expression of the electrical differences which exist between contiguous
strata in different degrees of turgor—the less charged being negative to the more.

The 8ame theory affords us a complete and satisfactory explanation of the gradual
change of potential which always results from repeated excitation, as well as for the
fact s0 constautly observed, that the © after effect” which follows each of the first few
excitations to which a leaf is subjected, is much greater in extent than those which

occur after later ones, and that eventually the after effect, fails entirely, reappearing
after a period of repose.

T need scarcely say that the firss phase of the variation—the eftect which
immediately follows excitation and has an opposite sign to the after effect and a
much higher electromotive force—does not admit of a similar explanation ; for it
cannot be imagined that a change which spreads over the whole lamina in less than
