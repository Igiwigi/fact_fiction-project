temperature ; and he suggested that such actions probably take place in the air
during storms, and when the atmosphere is charged with electricity, organic matters
absorbing nitrogen and oxygen. He also experimented with currents of much weaker
tension, more comparable with those incessantly occurring in the air, and in all cases
he found that nitrogen was fixed by the organic substance. The gains were in amount
such as would explain the source of the nitrogen which be considers crops must derive
from the atmosphere.

Subsequently, he found that free nitrogen was brought into combination by
argillaceous soils, when exposed in their natural condition, but not when they were
sterilised. He also found gain when the natural soils were enclosed. He considered
the results showed that there was gain of nitrogen quite independently of any absorp-
tion of combined nitrogen; in fact that there was fixation of free nitrogen due to
living organisms. He further considered that such gains, not only serve as compensa-
tion for exhaustion by cropping, &c., but explain how originally sterile argillaceous
soils eventually become vegetable moulds.

He also made experiments on the fixation of free nitrogen by vegetable earth
supporting vegetation ; and he found that there was a gain about equally divided
between the soil and the plant, the latter having taken it up from the soil, which he
considers is the true source of gain.

The results obtained under the influence of the silent discharge in bringing free
nitrogen into combination with certain vegetable principles, of course owed their
special interest to the inference that thus free nitrogen might be brought into
