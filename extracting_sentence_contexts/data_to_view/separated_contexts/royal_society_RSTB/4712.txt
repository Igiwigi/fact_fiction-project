In most the fate of the dorsal ccelom is
stated to be very similar to that shown in Peripatus, e.g., Euscorpius (3), Scolopendra (13),
Agalena (15), Donacia (14). But in some it is stated that the ccelom spaces, after the
heart has been formed, enlarge and persist as the pericardial space, Â¢.g., Theridium (17). In fact, one of the most recent workers on Arthropodan embryology adopts the view that
a true pericardium must originate from the coelom, otherwise the space surrounding
the heart is only topographically a pericardium (2). Estheria must be added to that group of forms the development of which agrees
with that of Peripatus. In Estheria there can be no doubt whatever that the coelom
pouches diminish in size and finally disappear, and that they do not in any way open
owt into the body cavity.
