The cardiac portion of these stomachs is very dis-
tinct from the pyloric. In snakes, turtles, and fishes, the 'stomachs have. the same
characters as in birds of -prey, but the cardiac and pyloric
portions are still more distinct from each other, and the solvent
glands are in general distributed over a larger surface of the
cardiac portion. From the series of facts and observations which have been
adduced, the-following conclusions may be drawn. That the solvent liquor is secreted from glands of a some-
what similar structure in all animals, but much larger and
more conspicuous in some than others. That these glands. are always situated near the orifice of
the cavity whose contents are exposed to their secretion.
