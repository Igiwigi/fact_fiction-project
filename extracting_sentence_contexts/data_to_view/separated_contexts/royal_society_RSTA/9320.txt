It will be noticed that, according to the views already outlined, rapid solution
should not be possible until the temperature of the specimen has risen sufficiently
far above the eutectoid point to make the differences between the equilibrium
concentrations at the boundary films considerable. Fig. 11, together with figs. 12 and 13, shows that what happens is in agreement
with this deduction. The fact that during heating from the air temperature the solution proceeds
rapidly immediately after it begins is additional evidence of the existence of the lag
already considered in § 3.

18. Application to the Case of Interrupted Solution of the Hutectoid. Fig. 2 (see this page) serves to show the behaviour of the material after interrupted
heating.
