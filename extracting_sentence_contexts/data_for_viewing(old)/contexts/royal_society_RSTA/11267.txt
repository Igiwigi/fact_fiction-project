The discrepancy indicates that in the waters of low salinity the chlorine forms a
smaller percentage of the total salts in my samples than in those used as standards ;
the difference may possibly be accounted for by the fact that while in the low-salinity
standards the salinity has been reduced by admixture of land water from the Baltic,
my samples have been freshened by water from melting ice (30). It seems not
impossible that the relative deficiency in chlorides known to exist in surface waters
near melting ice may make itself apparent in this way in the North Atlantic, but the
differences are so small as to require confirmation by other observers, and it would be
quite impossible to deal with differences in variations quantitatively by any known
methods. This point will be referred to again in discussing the salinities.

Partly with the object of checking the purity of the water-samples, and partly with
a lingering hope that some variation might be found sufficiently large to be useful in
studying the circulation, I made determinations of the total sulphates present in a
number of the samples received during the first year. The method deseribed by
