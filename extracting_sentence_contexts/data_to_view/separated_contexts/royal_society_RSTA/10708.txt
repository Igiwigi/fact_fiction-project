On
December 14th, 1797, the town of Cumana (Venezuela) was razed by a terrible
shock. On September 27th, 1796, an eruption took place in Guadeloupe. In 1800,
1801, and 1802 many earthquakes were felt in Maracaibo, Porto Cabello, and Caracas,
and in February, 1802, voleanie activity broke out in Guadeloupe. ||

The connection between earthquakes and volcanic activity is further emphasised
by the fact that in Guatemala a violent earthquake took place on April 18th, 1902,
just before Montagne Pelée began to emit steam, This earthquake was recorded on
the seismographs in the Isle of Wight.1 It was most severe in western Guatemala,
but affected also Salvador and Honduras. Quezaltenango was destroyed, and about
500 lives were lost, and extensive damage was done to the coffee and sugar
plantations in all the surrounding district.**

Further earthquakes, attended by eruptions, followed in October, and the excep-
tionally long duration of the disturbances in Martinique and St. Vincent during this
year—to which there is no parallel in the history of the Antilles—is to be ascribed
to the continuance of crustal adjustments affecting the whole borders of the
Caribbean Sea.
