Equation (3.17) predicts that the electrostatic component of the surface pressure, IT,, = IT — Io,
should increase proportional to n!/?, i.e. the surface pressure of a monolayer of charged particles
should increase with particle aggregation. This result can explain the increase in the slope of the
experimental plots in figure 2c,d with the increase in n with aggregation.
The values of N obtained from the slope of the plot of w (determined from photographs) versus
A are known, in our case, they are [24]

N=217 x 10° (experiment 1) and N=28.7 x 10° (experiment 2). (3.18)

In our experiments, the greatest compression of the monolayer was at a minimal surface area of
A=144cm”, which in view of equation (3.18) corresponds to a mean area per particle a = A/N =
66.4 jm? (experiment 1) and a = 50.3 uum? (experiment 2). For comparison, the smallest area per
particle at close contact is a, = 2V3R5 = 12.8 um’. The fact that aggregation is observed at not too
high a degree of compression (the minimal experimental a is considerably greater than aj) is an
indication of the action of long-range interparticle attraction, as discussed in §4c.

From the slopes of the /7 versus AS plots in figure 2b, using equations (3.17) and (3.18) we
can calculate the product Z;1'/4 (table 1). The observations made using the microscope of the
particle monolayers indicate that in cycle 1 on the surface of the water the particle aggregation is
negligible, ie. 1 = 1. Then, in view of table 1 we obtain

Z, =1.58 x 10° (experiment 1) and Z),=1.09 x 10° (experiment 2). (3.19)

From the values of Z; in equation (3.19), we can estimate the surface electric charge density (o)
under the assumption that the charges that create the electric field are located on the particle/air
