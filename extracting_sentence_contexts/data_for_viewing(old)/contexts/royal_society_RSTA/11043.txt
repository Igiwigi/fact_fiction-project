If we take it that there is an atomic or molecular specific heat /, of an elementary
substance which is constant in all states of the substance, and which is represented

* Note added March 3.—Experiments made since this paper was written, upon the metals silver, copper,
iron, and aluminium show that further investigation is necessary. The mean specific heat of silver,
for example, was found to be 0558 between 100° and 15°, and ‘0519 between 15° and —182°5, The
decrease of specific heat at the lower temperature is, therefore, much less than in the case of cobalt
and nickel.

A paper by U. Brun in the ‘Annalen der Physik’ (No. 2 for 1900, p. 257), issued on Feb. 16, did
not come into my hands till some time after the date of my communication to the Royal Society. My
attention was drawn by this paper to the fact that in 1898 the Author had commenced a series of
determinations of the specific heats of metals at low temperatures, and that about the same time some
experiments on the specific heats of three metals,—copper, iron, and aluminium,—at the temperature of
liquid air, had been published by C. C. TRowsripGE in the American periodical ‘Science’ (N.S. 8, p. 6,
1898). E

The results of the latter cannot claim to be very important, as no information is given concerning the
composition of the metals, and there is great uncertainty about the temperature of the liquid in which
they were cooled. The numerical values given by TROWBRIDGE are considerably higher than those of
BEHN, as also in the one case, aluminium, in which a comparison can be made with my results; the
mean specific heat between the temperature of air and that of boiling oxygen being 1833 according to
TROWBRIDGE, and ‘1676 according to my experiments.
