On the other hand, if7> (47—), then the corresponding two-dimensional problem, in fact,
becomes a subsonic one. For our three-dimensional problem, however, there is still a wave
drag, as is physically evident from the hydrodynamic analogue of the long gravity waves
produced by a plank of constantly increasing length, the two surfaces of which are pushed
apart with constant velocity. It will be our object to investigate how the wave drag varies
as the angle 7 is increased.
