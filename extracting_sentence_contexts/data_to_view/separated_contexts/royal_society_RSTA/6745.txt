from it the measure of time on the é-scale in terms of which the variation of surface tempera-
ture is given. ;

The distortion of the T-scale relative to the tscale (or vice versa) can be represented
mechanically by connecting the shafts of the machine representing ¢ and T by a continuously
variable gear giving a gear ratio proportional to the instantaneous value of D (or 1/D). An
integrator is just such a continuously variable gear; in fact from the definition (9-7) of T
it follows that

i [e2/m2D(@) aT. (11-1)

Hence if an integrator is displaced by an amount proportional to the instantaneous value of
1/D(@), and rotated from the shaft whose rotation measures 7, its output will be a measure
of ¢, and can be used to drive an input table carrying a graph of the surface temperature 6,
as a function of the true time ¢. The displacement proportional to 1/D(@) is furnished to the
machine from a second input table on which a curve of 1/D(@) as a function of @ is placed,
and which is driven by a shaft whose rotation measures the mean temperature 0. It is most convenient to take 9 as the temperature at one of the points x; =gl/n (for the
slab) or 7; = ja/n (for the cylinder) which bound the intervals into which the thickness of
the slab, or radius of the cylinder, is divided.
