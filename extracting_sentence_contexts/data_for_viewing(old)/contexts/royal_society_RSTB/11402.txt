on human minds, but it would be wrong to think of them as We can see the social processes of concept construction at

existing only in the mind. Monks tend to share various work in the history of science. Thomas Kuhn described


periods of scientific revolution where an accumulation of
problems and anomalies leads to one conceptual scheme
being overthrown and replaced by a new set of concepts
[32]. A paradigm example is the replacement of Newtonian
physics with relativity and quantum mechanics. The concept
SPACE-TIME was added and ETHER jettisoned. The fact that the
process of concept construction is social does not, in fact,
imply that the category referred to by the concept must be
socially constructed (although that separation can be dis-
puted). Neither space-time nor the molecular gene
depends for their existence on minds or our classificatory
practice. But the social processes of science explain how it
is that we now have the concepts spACEâ€”TIME and MOLECULAR
GENE.

For the social concepts HUMAN RIGHTS and DEMOCRACY, for
example, social concept construction goes hand-in-hand
with social construction of the category. Not only do we col-
lectively decide that the concept HUMAN RIGHTS is a good one to
