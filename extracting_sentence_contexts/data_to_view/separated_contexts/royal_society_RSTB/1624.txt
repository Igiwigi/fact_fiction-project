The presence of a right and left vertebral artery
(produced by lateral communicating branches of the interprotovertebral arteries)
makes it possible to distinguish in each arm of the hypochordal clasp a neural arch
and a rib, or, at least, the levels or points to which the capitula and tubercula of the
future ribs will be attached. A new thickening cluster has appeared in the skeleto-
genous layer, slightly behind the hypochordal clasp. This new cluster is unpaired, it
is thickest laterally and ventrally ; during its growth it grasps round the chorda from
below upwards, behaving, in fact, like a second posterior horseshoe. Middle of the 6th day.â€”-The unpaired ventral cluster has transformed itself into a
cartilaginous ring, which surrounds the chorda almost completely, being the foundation
or beginning of the centre or body of the vertebra. Headwards this centre touches the hypochordal cartilage, the arms of which are
now in connection with the likewise cartilaginous dorsal arches.
