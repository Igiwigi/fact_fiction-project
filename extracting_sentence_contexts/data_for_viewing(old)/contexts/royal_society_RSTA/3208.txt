constrained from astrophysical phenomena (e.g. super-radiance [31]). I do not expand
more on this here, but these bounds should be considered in any complete model.

— More important, scalar and vector fields mediate different forces away from the static
limit [5,30,32]. There are two issues here: one is that the currents to which scalars and
vectors couple are different. I discuss below on how breaking Lorentz invariance may :
help in this direction. The second one is that there is a velocity dependence in the [=
interaction mediated by vectors, as compared to scalars. According to Alves et al. [5], one 23
expects Aq < 10-7 from these ideas. If one allows for derivative couplings, and generic
scalar fields (I am thinking about scalars with expectation values, more complicated mea)
kinetic terms, etc.) it is not clear to me that this bound is unsurmountable. :

— Another important caveat comes from the composite nature of nucleons. In fact, the [4
virtual content (or self-energy or binding energy) is very important in nucleons at rest. DN
This has been used to claim that, since most of the mass of antihydrogen comes from 2S
gluons, only a 1% deviation for A, is possible when one considers the gravitation of 28
antihydrogen, given the current constraints on the gravitation of hydrogen [4]. This .
argument says nothing about new charges which do not affect the gluons, and thus I
do not think is very strong in this framework.> Also, an important contribution to the
nucleon itself comes from virtual antiquarks. Since the exact amount depends on the
nuclear binding energy, this effect will be different for different nuclei, and thus the
bounds from the equivalence principle can be recycled to constrain it [5].

This line of reasoning is correct, but the argument based on the energy in the nucleon
in the form of gluons (or partons) is not conclusive. The reason is that it is not very
