mode thus emits no sound wave. However, under the combined effects of nonlinearity and D8
mean-flow spreading, instability waves actually undergo amplification followed by saturation tw
and decay over a long length scale. Such a spatially modulated wave contains a supersonic 3
Fourier component, and hence emits a sound wave with the same frequency as that of the :g
instability mode. This mechanism, which may be termed ‘direct radiation’, was demonstrated :s
by Tam & Morris [15] in the case of a subsonic jet, and by Crighton & Huerre [47] for a simple :
specified wavepacket. This linear radiation mechanism is rather weak, and the emitted acoustic
field exhibits super-directivity, i.e. is confined in the small angles to the axial direction.

Wu & Huerre [44] considered sound generated by a nonlinear mechanism, specifically by the
interaction of a pair of helical modes in a circular jet. The disturbance is of the same form as (2.1).
As the modes evolve nonlinearly, their amplitude is governed by the amplitude equation (2.2)
with the nonlinear term NV being given by (2.3). An important fact is that the nonlinear interaction
drives a spanwise dependent mean-flow distortion, the streamwise velocity of which exhibits a
jump J, across the critical layer, through the jump 7%, (whose expression is given in (2.16)), a
mean-flow distortion, modulated slowly in both space and time, is generated in the main layer
with the streamwise velocity being of O(e) [42], and the pressure is €R-2/ 3m cos(2mé), where pm

With the second-order derivative with respect to x being absent, this is the long-wavelength limit
of the compressible Rayleigh equation. Across the critical layer, the pressure p,, is continuous, but
