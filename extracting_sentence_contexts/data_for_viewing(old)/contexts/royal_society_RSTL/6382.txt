In the first series of experiments made with this apparatus, I omitted to remove the
air from the space abore the liquid; each measure therefore sent in to the tube was a
mixture of yapour and air. This diminished the effect of the former; but the pro-

portionality, for small quantities, of density to absorption exhibits itself 80 decidedly as
to induce me to give the observations. "The first column, as usual, contains the measures
of vapour, the second the observed absorption, and the third the calculated absorption.
The galvanometric deflections are omitted, their equivalents being contained in the
second column. In fact as far as the eighth observation, the absorptions are merely
the record of the deflections.
