the Abbs ps La CAILLE's refraQtions are not juſt, but

174 Dr. MASKELYNE's Obſervations on the Latitude
anſwer, that the very ingenious method which he uſed of get
ting his refra&ions from the compariſon of the ſum of the
apparent altitudes of the poles at Paris and the Cape with the ſum
of the apparent zenith diſtances of ſtars paſſing the meridian bes
tween the two places, has fortunately, without his being aware
of it, given him the refraftions affe&ed with the error of t 6
arc of the inſtrument, and conſequently proper for correcting hi
obſervations; for, if the inſtrument be ſuppoſed ill divided
any errorin the diviſions will naturally be thrown upon the refrac
tions; and, if the total arc is too Jarge for the radius, the ſta
will appear to approach the zenith by the error of the diviſions
a5 well as the refraQtions, and the refraQtions in the table wi
come out too large, but ſtill ſuitable to the inſtrument, becau
a corre&tion is neceflary to be added to the obſerved Zenit]
diſtance, on account of the error of the inſtrument, as well
of the true refraQions, and the table deduced from the inſtrumen
gives the ſum of the two correQons together, without. dete
mining them ſeparately.
