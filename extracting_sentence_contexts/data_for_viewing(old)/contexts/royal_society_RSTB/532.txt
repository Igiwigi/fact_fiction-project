fixation of free nitrogen within the soil under the influence of porous and alkaline
bodies, as supposed by Coiiz and Franx, rather than to the fixation of free nitrogen
either under the influence of micro-organisms, or directly by the plants themselves.
In fact, neither were the conditions of his experiment with the clover in burnt soil,
nor those of his later experiments in washed sand, such as to favour the supposition
of the intervention of micro-organisms. On the other hand, he considers they were
favourable for the absorption of combined nitrogen from the air, and for the supposed
fixation of free nitrogen within the soil under the influence of porous and alkaline
bodies. At the same time, he admits that it is not easy to explain why Graminez do
not, equally with the Leguminose, benefit by such absorption, and by such fixation.

For our part we believe that a careful consideration of all that is involved in this
undoubted fact, points to the exclusion of the supposition that the gain is either by
the absorption of ammonia from the air, or by the fixation of free nitrogen within the

soil under the influence of porous and alkaline bodies. We shall refer to the point
again in our concluding remarks, but we may here say in passing, that the results of
our experiments on the growth of wheat for many years in succession on the same
land without nitrogenous manure, show that with much less nitrogen annually
removed in the crops, and estimated to be lost by drainage, than would be required
for the growth of the Leguminosz in Worrr’s experiments, the soil has nevertheless
lost much nitrogen. Again, taking the average of ten yéars, the amount of nitrogen
