carried along the conductor by the current. Probably Maxwerrs use of the term
* displacement” to describe one of the factors of the electric energy of the medium has
tended to support this notion. Tt is very difficult to keep clearly in mind that this
* displacement” is, as far as we are yet warranted in describing it, merely a something
with direction which has some of the properties of an actual displacement in incom-
pressible fluids or solids. When we learn that the © displacement” in a conduetor
having a current in it increases continually with the time, it is almost impossible to
avoid picturing something moving along the conductor, and it then seems only natural
to endow this gomething with energy-carrying power. Of eourse it may turn out that
there is an actual displacement along the lines of electromotive intensity. But ib is
quite as likely that the electric © displacement” is only a function of the true displace-
ment, and it is conceivable that many theories may be formed in which this is the
cage, while they may all account for the observed facts. Mr. GLAZEBROOK has already
worked out one such theory in which the component of the electric displacement ab

T have therefore given several cases in considerable detail of the application of the
