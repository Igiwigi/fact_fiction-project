solution not for a single cylinder of the given cross-section placed in a magnetic
field, but of a whole row or grating of such cylinders, the distance apart of any
two neighbouring cylinders being equal to the breadth of the liquid film.

Fig. 11 gives the solution for an elliptic cylinder similar to that in fig. 10, but
having a permeability of 20. In fig. 12 we again have a cylinder of the same
cross-section, but of permeability equal to 1000. On account of the great depth of
the elliptic wall, the lines crossing the ellipse appear to be almost entirely obliterated ;
notwithstanding this fact, they emerge on the other side, preserving their identity
and not mixing with the body of the liquid. The distortion of the lines close to and
on the inner side of the elliptic boundary is in this case very strongly marked, and
well illustrates one of the difficulties encountered in attempting to imitate the
effects of highly permeable bodies.

An interesting feature, well-known as a result of theoretical deductions, is clearly
brought out by a comparison of the three diagrams, viz., the gradual decrease in the
angle made by the external lines with the normal to the ellipse as the permeability is
increased. Thus in fig. 11 this angle of incidence of the lines is quite large at certain
points of the elliptic boundary; it is greatly reduced in fig, 10, and in fig, 12, for
which the permeability is 1000, it is practically zero.
