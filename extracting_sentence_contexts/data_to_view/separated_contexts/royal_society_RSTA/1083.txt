The curve of differences was quasi-hyperbolic, and the validity of
the analysis was tested by the extent to which the loop, which is such a conspicuous
feature of the curves of rotatory dispersion in the region covered by the absorption band,
was eliminated. Subsequent investigations by Kuun and Braun§ showed that this elimination was
far from complete, since the curves of differences included two “ shoulders,” which
could not be got rid of by any re-adjustment of the constants of the equation. This
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘ damped ’’ vibrators is
not applicable to the broad absorption bands of a liquid. The absorption curves based
on this hypothesis show two non-existent shoulders, one on either side of the head of the
band, and these are reproduced in the curves of rotatory dispersion deduced by means of
this absorption-law. Absorption curves which show a much closer resemblance to those observed experi-
mentally can be deduced, as Breteckt and Henri|| have shown, by using an exponential
formula to express the distribution of frequencies amongst the various vibrators.
