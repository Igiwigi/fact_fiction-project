before either hooklets or suckers can be distinguished. See Plate XI. fig. 8. The neck
afterwards continues to grow, $0 that its relative length in respect to the ventral portion
is some indication of the age of a Cysticercus.

It is probable that this part does not arrive at its full size until after it has been pro-
truded, which I have never seen to be the case in any animalcules occuring in or
between the muscular fibres, and which perhaps is not effected until the entozoa quit
their confined locality between the muscular fibres, and gain access to the free surface of
a mucous membrane, there, as physiologists generally believe, to be further developed
into a higher form of entozoon.

In the preceding observations on the development of the Cysticercns cellulos@, T have
confined myself entirely to such facts as are 80 obvious and easy of verification, as to


CFSTICERCUS CELLULOSA, AS FOUND IN THE MUSCLES OF THE PIG. 121

leave no doubt of their general accuracy, also to such explanations of their meaning as
appear to be almost self-evident ; and here I might have concluded this paper had there
not remained some considerations entirely of a theoretical nature too important to be
omitted. .

It will be asked, how the Cysticercus, in its earliest condition, such as I have described
it, finds access to the interior of a primary fasciculus. Before attempting to answer this
question, I must observe that my description commences from a condition of this ento-
