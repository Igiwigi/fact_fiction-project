for the purpose of brief and clear description to indicate each of such Processes by a
single definite name, capable of being formed into an adjective to express the pro-
perties or appendages of such processes*,

The convenience of such terms will be admitted by the Human Anatomist who
considers that the processes in question have, as yet, received no distinct substantive
names in Anthropotomy ; and who knows, from Osteogeny, how vaguely some of the
descriptive terms, as * transverse process,” for example, are applied to parts obviously
very different in their nature and constitution. The * transverse proces” of a dorsal
vertebra is a simple exogenous growth from the neurapophysis, commonly affording
an articular surface for a rib ; the © transverse process* of a sacral yertebra-þ is an
autogenous part, which continues distinct long after birth ; the © transverse process?
of a cervical vertebra is partly exogenous, partly antogenous, consisting in fact of
two distinct, processes and a rudimental rib, but distinguished in Anthropotomy from
other transyerse processes only by © being perforated.”

But if such common phrase of © transverse process, with a note of distinction, as
that *it is perforated in the cervical vertebrze,” be suflicient for the exigencies and
applications of Human Anatomy, it becomes quite inadequate and often totally inap-
plicable to the answerable parts in the lower animals: in the Crocodile, for example,
the cervical rib is much more developed and maintains constantly a free articulation
by a © head” with a well-developed inferior transverse process (f radix antica,” Soz.),
and by a * tubercle” with an equally distinct superior transverse process (* radix pos-
tica,' SognM.). In the Wombat (Plate XLIV. fig. 12), the Hare, the Pig, and most other
quadrupeds, the transverse process of the lumbar vertebra? consists of an exogenous
