fluid, began to be admitted. Dr. Hi, in the notes to his Englisb translation of
Â«SwamMERDAM's Biblia Nature, two years later, mentioned them as abundant in the
Frog at the season of pairing, but that it was then the fashion to doubt even their
existence. Yet NEEpnan, ten years after this, while acknowledging that these bodies
are found in the fluid of all animals, adopting the views of Burrox and DauBexTox,
stated that they do not exist until after the fluid is removed from the vessels, and
decomposition has commenced||. And later still, eyen in our own time, their existence
has been denied in the most positive manner by Sir Everarp Home. Spailaxzani,
however, was $0 well acquainted with them, as found in the Frog and Toad, that he
has recorded his great surprise at not observing them in the latter on two occasions*#,
BoxxeT| and GLecusx}4, also, well knew them to abound in the males of animals
of distinet species at the season of impregnation, but discovered that they are usually
absent in hybrids, a fact that has since been confirmed by Prevosr and Dumas 4.
These two observers, regarding the spermatic bodies, with LEgwENHork, as essential
elements of the semen, believed that they actually penetrate bodily into the ovum, and
become by metamorphosis part of the future embryo. Still more recently it has been
stated by Dr. Barry |||| to this Society that he has actually seen the spermatozoon within
the ovum, a statement which my own observations do not enable me to confirm.
Before any satisfactory conclusion could be arrived at respecting the importance
of the spermatic bodies in impregnation, it was necessary to ascertain their nature,
to trace their mode of development and production, to establish the periods of their
occurrence in different classes of animals, and to learn something of their chemical
