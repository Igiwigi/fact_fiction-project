These remarks might suggest asking a different question: ‘Under what prior is the lasso
estimate the posterior mean’? I believe the answer to this is that no such prior exists. Because
of this I tend to think of the lasso as not really corresponding to a Bayesian procedure, at least
not one that I would defend. This does not imply that lasso is not useful in practice, but it does
make it harder to use Bayesian arguments to deduce under what situations it might be expected to
perform well. Of course, there is extensive frequentist theory to help guide us here; [31] provides
a brief review and some numerical studies.

3. Bayesian blinkers

Historically, debates over the relative merits of Bayesian versus non-Bayesian methods have often
been heated. While I like to think that we have gotten over the worst of this, there remain,
undoubtedly, some statisticians with entrenched positions. Furthermore, the fact of the matter
is that we all come to a problem with our own set of tools that we feel comfortable with. Thus,
in some cases Bayesian methods may be used either because of philosophical intransigence, or
simply lack of knowledge or due consideration of possible alternatives. (And, of course, the same
applies to non-Bayesian methods.)

I myself have made extensive use of Bayesian methods, and most of my work has a Bayesian
component. However, I have learned from experience that not all problems need to be tackled in
a Bayesian way. In particular, it is sometimes worth compromising between statistical principle
and computational practice. In this section, I discuss two examples where, perhaps, my ‘Bayesian
blinkers’ lead me to ignore other possible approaches. Certainly, they are examples where I
tackled a problem in a Bayesian way, but now typically use non-Bayesian approaches for these
problems.>
