of this magnificent amphitheatre were fringed with various evergreens and aromatic shrubs, flowers, and
many alpine plants. On the north and south sides of the base of the cone were two pieces of water, one
perfectly pure and tasteless, the other strongly impregnated with sulphur and alum. This lonely and
beautiful spot was rendered more enchanting by the singularly melodious notes of a bird, an inhabitant of
these upper solitudes, and altogether unknown to the other parts of the island; hence principally called

or supposed to be invisible ; though it certainly has been seen, and is a species of the merle.

“A century has now elapsed since the last convulsion of the mountain, or since any other element had
disturbed the serenity of this wilderness than those which are common to the tropical tempest ; it
apparently slumbered in primeval solitude and tranquillity, and from the luxuriant vegetation and growth
of the forest, which covered its sides from the base nearly to the summit, seemed to discountenance the
fact and falsify the records of the ancient voleano. Such was the majestic, peaceful Soufriére on April 27th,
but we trod on ‘ignem repositum cineri doloso, * and our imaginary safety was soon to be confounded by
the sudden danger of devastation. Just as the plantation bells rang 12 at noon on Monday, the 27th, an
abrupt and dreadful crash from the mountain, with a severe concussion of the earth and tremulous noise in
the air, alarmed all around it. The resurrection of this fiery furnace was proclaimed in a moment by a

vast column of thick, black, ropey smoke, like that of an immense glass-house, bursting forth at once, and

* & Tynes supposits cinert doloso.’—Horaog, Il, Od. I, 7.
