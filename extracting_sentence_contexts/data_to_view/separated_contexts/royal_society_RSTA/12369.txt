Sb In a paper printed in the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal Society,’ No. 190, 1878 (vol. 28,
s pp. 2-35), I gave an account of some experiments undertaken in order to test the

R=} possibility of using the Common Balance in place of the Torsion Balance in the
a Cavendish Experiment. The success obtained seemed to justify the intention
EB expressed in that paper to continue the work, using a large bullion balance, instead
2 of the chemical balance with which the preliminary experiments were made.

2 As I have had the honour to obtain grants from the Royal Society for the
> construction of the necessary apparatus, I have been able to carry out the experiment
= on the larger scale which appeared likely to render the method more satisfactory,
& and this paper contains an account of the results obtained.

iE At the time I was making the preliminary experiments the late Professor v. JoLLy
& was already employing the balance for gravitation investigations (‘ Wiedemann’s

i Annalen,’ vol. 5, p. 112), though I was not aware of the fact. Later he published an
3 account (‘ Wied. Ann.,’ vol. 14, p. 331) of a determination of the Mean Density of
€ the Earth by the use of the Balance.
