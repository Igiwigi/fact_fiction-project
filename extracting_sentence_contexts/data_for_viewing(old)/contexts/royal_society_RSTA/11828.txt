The experiments described in the first part of this paper naturally suggested ¢
enquiry whether gold would still permeate lead if the temperature were maintaine
at a point far below the melting point of lead. Would diffusion take place throug
solid lead at the ordinary temperature, or must a certain amount of viscosity ’
given to it by the application of a moderate heat? These were questions whid
demanded attention.

Historical.

The history of the diffusion of solids is full of interest, and it may be convenien
as far as possible, to group the facts which are known, rather than to deal with ther
in strict chronological order.

“ Kernel Roasting.” —There has long been a prevalent belief that diffusion can tak
place in solids, and the practice in conducting certain important industrial processe
supports this view. One of these processes, which is of comparatively ancient dat 5
has certainly been employed since 1692 at Agordo, and its results are as follows
When lumps of cupriferous iron pyrites are subjected to very gradual roasting with
access of air, the copper becomes concentrated as a “ kernel” of nearly pure sulphide
of copper in the centre of a mass of ferric oxide, while, at the same time, the silve
originally present in the ore travels outwards and forms a glistening shell on
exterior. These complicated changes must be effected in the solid by a movement
allied to diffusion.
