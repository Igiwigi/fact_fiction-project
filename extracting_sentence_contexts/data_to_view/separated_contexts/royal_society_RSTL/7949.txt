Trans. 1856, T derived the conclusion, which, as it now appears, was erroneous, that
for a binary quintic the number of irreducible covariants was infinite. 'The theory
requires, m fact, a modification, by reason that, certain linear relations, which I had
asxumed to be independent, are really not independent, but, on the contrary, linearly
connected together: the interconnexion in question does not occur in regard to the
quadric, cubic, or quartic; and for these cases respectively the theory is true as it stands ;
for the quintic the interconnexion first preents itself in regard to the degree 8 in the
coefficients and order 14 in the yariables, viz. the theory gives correctly the number of
coyariants of any degree not exceeding 7, and also those of the degree 8 and order less
than 14; but for the order 14 the theory as it stands gives a non-existent irreducible
covariant (@, . .Y(@, y)'%, viz.
