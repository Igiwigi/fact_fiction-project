of suspension, or some other influential property : and comprise almost every
variety of pendulum that is ever likely to be made the subject of experiment.
In order to prevent confusion in occasionally referring to them, I shall here
arrange them in numerical order, and class them according to their form.

No. 1, 2, 3, 4, are spheres of platina, lead, brass and ivory ; all of the 8ame
diameter ; which is s0omewhat less than 14 inch. The platina sphere (No. 1.),
which has been kindly lent to me, for the occasion, by the Astronomer Royal,
is of French manufacture, and about 1-44 inch in diameter ; which is the
same size as that used by M. Bror in his pendulum experiments, and in fact
appears to have been formed from the same model *, It is furnished with a
copper calotte, and also with a knife edge, attached to a frame, capable of
being brought to a state of synchronism with the pendulum with which it is
used, by means of a screw, in the manner described by M. Borpa in the Base
du Syst&me Mc6trique, vol. iii. page 338. Its specific gravity I found to be
21-042 ; and it weighed 8963 grains. The copper calotte weighed 87 grains,
and was firmly attached to the platina sphere by means of shell-lac ; as the
ordinary mode, by greasing the parts, failed in the present experiments. I un-
fortunately attempted the usual method, in the first instance, not recollecting
that the adhesion is caused principally by the pressure of the atmosphere ;
and that when that pressure is removed the sphere would no longer be sup-
ported. This proved to be the case; and the platina sphere, in its fall, re-
