extending farther behind the knee than in front (diagr. 1), but quite distinct for a short
distance in front of the knee, The degeneration does not involve the whole breadth
of the internal capsule, but leaves the inner border almost entirely free.

OF THE GYRUS MARGINALIS AND GYRUS FORNICATUS IN MONKEYS. 351

The part of the capsule along the inner border is occupied by the fibres from the
gyrus marginalis (diagr. 2), as is proved by the fact that when the entire motor
area (including the gyrus marginalis) is removed, the whole width of the internal
capsule is degenerated (diagr. 3), although the inner border never appears so
completely degenerated as the outer.
