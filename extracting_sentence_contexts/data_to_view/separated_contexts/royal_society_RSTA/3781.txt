So far as the resistance of the are is concerned, there seem to be no difficulties, the
known relations between the size and shape of the vapour column, the size of the
craters, the current, and the are length. explain the observed changes in resistance
when the two latter variables are altered. The magnitude of the resistance of the
vapour column and of the contacts between it and the electrodes are not such as to
offer serious difficulties, nor does the fact that they are altered by the presence of
foreign bodies. Any explanation of the back E.M.F. of the are as a whole must, in the light ot
the results given in the last section, account for the existence of two unequal E.M.F.â€™s
of opposite signs, of which the larger opposes the flow of the current. The observed
back E.M.F. of the are is the resultant of these two, their values being of the order
of 17 volts and 6 volts respectively in the solid arc.
