At its conical apex, this tubercle exhibits exactly the same
contour as those to which I have already called attention in figs. 22, 28, and 24, but,
in addition, the vessels constituting the large bundle corresponding to Plate 4, fig. 39,
are conspicuous at its apical extremity, each trachea being filled with white earthy
matter. This fact demonstrates the absolute certainty that the tubercle was once
prolonged into some large deciduous appendage that has now disappeared, and which
can only have been a strobilus, a large deciduous organ of any other kind being a
wholly unknown thing amongst these Lepidodendroid plants. In Plate 7, fig. 40, we have a portion of a transverse section of a tubercle belonging
to a larger Ulododendroid stem than those already described.
