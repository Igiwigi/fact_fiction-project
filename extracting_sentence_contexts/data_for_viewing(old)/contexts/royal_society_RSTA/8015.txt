and the suggested definition of the metre is based on the same value reduced to vacuum
by the aid of a correction derived from a precise determination of the refractive index
of air, the value of the Angstrom would be automatically preserved by re-defining it
for the future simply as 107"? M.

With regard to the yard, it is suggested that advantage might be taken of the oppor-
tunity afforded by its re-definition in terms of wave-lengths of light to choose the
definition in such a manner that the simple approximate ratio of 1 yard = 0-9144 metre
(or 1 inch = 25-4 mm.) should for the future be accurately true. This simple factor
differs by less than 2 parts in 10° from the true value at the present time (vide section 7).
It is closely the mean between the yards at present current in Great Britain and the

United States, and is, in fact, already generally employed in both countries for industrial
purposes. Its adoption, moreover, would appear to be not without some historical
justification, which it is hoped to discuss in a later paper. There is reason to hope
that a similar definition might also be adopted by the United States and thus end the
present slight divergence between the yards of the two countries.

On this basis then we should have :—

1 Yard = 1,552,734:81 X 0:9144 = 1,419,820°71 ax in vacuum.

Referring to Table XVII, it will be seen that the directly determined value of the
Imperial Standard Yard is 1,419,818-31 Ay in vacuum, which differs from the suggested
value by 1-7 parts in 10°.
