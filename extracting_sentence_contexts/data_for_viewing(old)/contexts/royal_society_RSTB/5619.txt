Table XIII shows that all members of the A. flavus-oryz@ group give rise to large
amounts of volatile neutral compounds, and in addition almost all give kojic acid. A.
novus Wrumer is entirely lacking in either of these characteristics and its balance

sheet is entirely of the type of Group 2. The fact that none of the species included in
this group produces volatile neutral compounds is further supported by the fact that
all of them have respiration coefficients approximating to unity.

(4) The main positive biochemical characteristics of this group are :—

(a) The production of relatively large amounts of “ carbon unaccounted for.”
(b) The production of a medium amount of non-volatile acids.
(c) The production of some optically active compound, as is indicated by the fact
