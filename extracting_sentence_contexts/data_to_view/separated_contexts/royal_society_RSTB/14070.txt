The maternal X chromosome upregulation found in
S. latifolia males and females [59] brings a new light to inter-
pret early cytological results. The hypermethylated X in
females could be the paternal X (expressed at ancestral
levels), while the hypomethylated X could be the upregulated
maternal X in males and females. Hypermethylation could be
the ancestral epigenetic state of the X chromosome, as
suggested by the fact that the paternal X is expressed at
ancestral levels. Epigenetic studies in other Silene species
without sex chromosomes could help clarifying this point. A recent study corroborated this hypothesis using various
antibodies against active and repressive histone marks and
DNA methylation.
