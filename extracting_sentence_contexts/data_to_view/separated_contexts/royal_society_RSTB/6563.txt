The question of the extent of the folding of the cortex in
this region as a possible basis for racial comparison justifies a somewhat full quotation
of CunnincHAM’s (1892) attempt to explain the asymmetry. He says :—

p. 127. “I have seen that the insula on the left side is relatively longer than
the corresponding area on the right side, and the question, therefore, naturally
arises: Is this difference in the size of the two insulae not the cause of the
difference in the length of the two posterior limbs of the Sylvian fissure ?

“My own belief is that it is not, because, as we shall see later on, a similar
difference in the size of the insula in the two sexes is not followed by a corre-
sponding difference in the length of the fissure in the male and female ; and,
further, the fissure in the ape is relatively much longer than in man and yet the
insula is shorter. The cause is to be looked for in the condition of the transverse
temporal convolutions of Heschl, and also of the arching convolutions which
connect the supramarginal and angular gyri with the upper two convolution-
tiers of the temporal lobe. . . .

‘* The greater relative-length of the fissure in the ape is partly due to the fact
that in man we have not included in the measurements the ramus posterior
ascendens. But this is not the sole cause. The decrease in the length of the
Sylvian fissure in man is largely brought about by an increase in the size of the
arching convolutions which connect the supramarginal and angular gyri of the
parietal lobe with the upper convolutions of the temporal lobe.
