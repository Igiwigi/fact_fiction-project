Quite on the contrary, the shapes
were selected to illustrate the high degree of arbitrariness allowed for the geometry of the
ENZ host while still preserving the occurrence of the resonant effect. This includes shapes with
relatively rough boundaries, which are likely to minimize the field excited within the body. Despite this fact, it is worth noting that the predicted magnetic field peak enhancements are in
all studied cases larger than the global maxima for the bare dielectric rod. This result supports
the concept of magnetic field enhancement being an intrinsic property of dielectric resonators
immersed in ENZ media.
