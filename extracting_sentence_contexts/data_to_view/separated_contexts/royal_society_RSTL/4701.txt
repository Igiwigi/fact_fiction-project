Rubian cannot be considered as a colouring matter in the ordinary sense of the
word. It imparts hardly any colour to mordanted cloth, when an attempt is made
to dye with it in the usual way, the alumina mordant only acquiring a slight orange,
the iron mordant a light brown colour. Composition of Rubian.â€”In determining the composition of rubian, I found it
necessary to take into consideration the fact of its leaving when burnt a considerable
quantity of ash. This ash consists almost entirely of carbonate of lime. The amount
of ash is not uniform in different specimens; it is greatest when the rubian has been
purified by means of sulphuric acid, but I have never been able to obtain it in a state
in which it burns without any residue.
