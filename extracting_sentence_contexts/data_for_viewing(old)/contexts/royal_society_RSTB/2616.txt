that the invagination of the mesenterial portion of the body-wall takes place at some
distance below, and is at first of posterior date to that of the septal and costal
portions. Heuce the parts of the mesenteries enclosed in the synapticular channels
are continuous in the open interseptal loculus above the synapticular invagination.
In other words, the mesenteries in the synapticular channels are merely the prolon-
gations of the mesenteries in the upper non-synapticular part of the cclenteron.
Further, the mesenteries pass continuously over the synapticular wall into the
“ Randplatte,” or edge-zone, of the polyp.

Turbinaria, on the other hand, at once distinguishes itself in the fact that, at
the peripheral portion of each polyp where mural invaginations are formed, they
form contemporaneously with or even prior to the invaginations in which septa are
produced. This fact I have deduced from a series of sections. In all types men-
tioned above, the synapticule form subsequently to the septa, and microscopic
sections show that the calcareous deposit around the septal centres of calcification
serves as the starting-point of a synapticula, the prop on which the mesenterial
body-wall temporarily supports itself in the course of its further invagination. In
the converse case represented by Turbinaria, the sections show a mural ring of
calcification centres around the polyp, from which at certain points processes grow
out and serve in their turn as the starting-points of septa. I describe here merely
the appearances of the section. A comparison between transverse sections of
Siderastrea (fig. 43) or Eupsummia (fig. 52), on the one hand, and Turbinaria
(fig. 58) and Madrepora (fig. 57), on the other, will explain the difference.

The same difference may be observed between the transverse sections of the wall
