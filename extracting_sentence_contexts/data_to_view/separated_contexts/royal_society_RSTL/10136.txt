A large tract of palatal tissue intervenes between this weak floor and the roof of the
mouth (m.), the cavity of which is formed of three fissures, the outer and upper pair
being semicircular, and the median, or lower, 8ub-oblong, but widest above, and
having its sides running between deep folds. Above, the median line of the mouth is
grooved ; below, it is gently ridged ; the lateral folds are the fore part of the supra-
lingual framework. The proper lingual cartilages (b.hy*.) are now 8een to be four,
instead of two, for the median pair have come into view (see also Plate 9, fig. 3); the
apparent distance between the bars, here, is due to the fact that only the projecting
tore end of each was cut through. Section 10 (fig. 10). —This section is very similar to the last, but is important as
showing the fusion of the two median bars (b.hy.*) ; in this old specimen the fusion is
perfect, but in the one dissected there was some appearance of distinctness along the
midline, below (Plate 9, fig. 3); here the edges are thicker than the middle, which
18 gently scooped. Section 11 (fig. 11).—Several new things come into this section ; and here in the
middle of the nasal capsule the lower cartilaginous bars are seen to have their own
fold, but it is not free, 80 that there are only seven distinet folds in the sac.
