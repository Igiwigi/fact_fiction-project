The best
starting point can be reached if we have these particles move with the speed of light in a multitude
of possible directions. That will not be exactly Poincaré invariant, but we suspect that, without
gravity, this may be the best we can do. Our second step is then to cast the evolution law of these particles in terms of a Schrodinger
equation, by writing U)(5t) = e~!1*!, where the index 1 refers to the fact that here we are dealing
with only one particle. This Hamiltonian will have a spectrum ranging from —z/ét to 75t. Next,
we subject this to second quantization, as follows.
