Finally, on 24 May 1894, Reynolds read the outcome of his protracted considerations to a meeting
at the Royal Society. Shortly before that date he had had copies of his paper printed and had
forwarded a number of them to the editor of Philosophical Transactions to be considered for
publication. In fact, Lord Rayleigh had in the meantime become the editor of the journal and,
naturally, he sent the paper for review to Sir George Stokes, who, having completed his term of
office as President of the Royal Society, had returned to normal academic life. This time, however,
unlike his enthusiastic review of the 1883 paper, Stokes, at the age of 75, was both equivocal and
perplexed. Figure 1 shows a photograph of his typed letter of 31 October, a classic example of
sitting on the fence.
