The tessellations
{p,q} and 4 were described by Abiâ€™l Wafa, a tenth-century Arab (see Woepcke 1855,
pp. 352-357). One advantage of shifting our attention from solids to spherical tessellations is that the
symbol {/, q} is just as significant when / or g takes the value 2 as when both are greater
than 2. In fact, {2} isa spherical digon or lune, and {2, g} is an arrangement of g lunes formed
by q great semicircles (meridians). Moreover, the faces of {/,2} are the northern and
southern hemispheres, regarded as spherical /-gons whose vertices coincide with / points
evenly distributed along the equator. The symbol t{2, g} for the g-gonal prism is now fully
justified; this figure has two vertices on each edge of {2, q}, just as the truncated cube has
two vertices on each edge of the cube.
