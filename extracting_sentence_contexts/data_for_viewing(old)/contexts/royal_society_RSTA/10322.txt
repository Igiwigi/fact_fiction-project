474 DR. CHARLES G. BARKLA ON POLARISED RONTGEN RADIATION.

that a change of position of the bulb by any such angle did not appreciably affect the
result, so that by using an entirely different portion of the primary radiation no
sensible difference in the results was detected. But, perhaps, the most conclusive
proof of all was given when lead, copper, iron and such heavy metals were used as
radiators. The shape and size of these were exactly those of the paper and aluminium
radiators, yet when they were used no variation in intensity was detected.

This result must be connected with the fact that from these metals the radiation
differs considerably from the primary which produces it, while from paper and
aluminium the radiation bears a much closer resemblance to the primary.

In addition to these experiments many changes were made in the apparatus
without affecting the results described. Three or four different X-ray tubes were
used to produce the radiation, though all were of the same type,* the sizes of
apertures were varied considerably, the whole apparatus was taken down and
reconstructed, and the distances between screens were varied.

Having given the experimental evidence that the variation in intensity was due
simply to the fact that from certain light radiators placed in such a primary beam the
intensity of secondary radiation depended on the position of a plane passing through
