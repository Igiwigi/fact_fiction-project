this subject fully would belong rather to a formal treatise upon the Mollusea. For
the present my object is merely to point out the fundamental unity which obtains

* For clearness' zake I have referred to the © hzmal” and © neural” flexures as if they always took place in
a yertical plane, whereas, as every one knows, the anal aperture is almost always either to the right or the left
in the Gasteropoda. The only modification of the theory required to meet this fact, is to suppose that the
hwmal outgrowth takes place more rapidly on one side than on the other.

among certain of the most important systems of organs, and to bring into prominence
some facts in the anatomy of the Mollusca which have hitherto been unknown or
neglected.

With these views I propose to treat—-1, of the nervous system ; 2, of the vascular
system ; 3, of certain portions of the alimentary system ; and 4, of the renal system.

I. Nervous System.—The nervous system of every Mollusk consists of two great
systems ;—A. an excito-motor, or sensory and yolitional system ; B. a visceral or
sympathetic system. The former consists of three pairs of primary ganglia, which
always exist, and of a variable number of accessory local ganglia, which may or may
not exist*,

* The first record I can find of the distinct enunciation of this very important anatomical fact, is in M, Sov-
