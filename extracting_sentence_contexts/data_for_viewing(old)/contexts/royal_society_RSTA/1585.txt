The instability of the second moments (also called ‘energetic instability’) of linear stochastic :8
systems with multiplicative noise has been discussed in several papers, cf. e.g. [16]. The physical [8
explanation of it is based on considering realizations of the stochastic process 22 + &(#). This .
process represents ‘switching’ of the natural frequency of the linear oscillator. In some realizations
(at least for certain time periods), this switching will occur with an average frequency ~ 2A,
leading to the conventional parametric resonance arising in the system. Thus, even though some
realizations of the stochastic process will be stable, the second moments of the system will diverge.
The instability is not exhibited by the first moments due to the fact that when taking the mean
average of all realizations, those that resulted in stochastic variables growing boundlessly in the
positive direction were cancelled out by those growing in the negative direction.

This explanation implies that the cause of the instability of the linear stochastic system (3.1) is
similar to the one featured by the conventional deterministic oscillator excited parametrically with
frequency ~ 24. We note, however, that there is an essential difference between the behaviours of
the stochastic and deterministic systems, namely, that even for D > Dmin certain realizations of
the stochastic process may be stable, whereas the corresponding deterministic system is always
unstable if the threshold excitation strength is exceeded (therefore, in figure 2, we have a smooth
curve, because we considered only a finite number of realizations).

Now we employ the ‘deterministic’ approach, i.e. replace noise with high-frequency excitation,
