On the other hand, the values of y and a
we may assume to be less influenced by the level of expertise of individuals.

(c) Properties of the kinetic SEIR model with competence

In this section, we analyse some of the properties of the Boltzmann system (2.7). First, let us
consider the reproducing ratio in the presence of knowledge. By integrating system (2.7) against x, and considering only the compartments of individuals
that may disseminate the fake news, we have

wo =| K(x, b)fs(x, t) dx — | 5(x)fe(x, t) dx,
ac x x (2.8)
and “ =| 5(x)(1 — n(x))fe(x, t) dx -| y (x)fi(x, t) dx.
x x

In the above derivation, we used the fact that the Boltzmann interaction terms describing
knowledge evolution among agents preserve the total number of individuals and therefore
vanish. Following the analysis in [36], and omitting the details for brevity, we obtain a
reproduction number generalizing the classical one

Sx K(x, bfs(x, #) dx

RolO = Tye Dd”

(2.9)


Finally, following the analysis in [30], it can be proved the uniqueness of the solution of (2.7)
in the simplified case of constant parameters: A(x, x.) = 6 > 0, y(x)=y > 0, (x) =5 > 0, n(x) = €
[0,1], a(x) =a € [0,1]. The interested reader can find the details in the electronic supplementary
material.
