It appears from the theory below that this information, together with the vernier

reading“at a third station and the corresponding temperature readings at each station,
give us all the data necessary for calculating the value of gravity at the third station.

The necessity of observing the temperature arises from the fact that the rigidity
of fused quartz threads increases with increase of temperature. The effect is, of
course, complicated by the changes which take place in the dimensions of the threads.
The nett result is that as the temperature rises the “stiffness” of the threads
increases.*

The dimensions of the lever also change, and in such a manner as to partially
compensate the changes of “stiffness” taking place in the thread. In the actual
instrument the resilience as well as the figure of the coach spring vary with
temperature, the line of collimation of the microscope may also vary relatively to the
level, and the metal framework may also twist and vary in shape in any manner.
All these effects are found to be capable of collection into a single temperature
coefficient—which, so far, we have found to be sufficiently well expressed by a single
