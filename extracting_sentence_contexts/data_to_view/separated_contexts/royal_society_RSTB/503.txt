QUESTION OF THE SOURCES OF THE NITROGEN OF VEGETATION. 19

salts and in the later as sodium nitrate, there is some, but comparatively little increase
in the amount of nitrogen in the crop. Tn connection with the fact of the gradual decline in yield, it should be explained
that owing to failure of the beans there wasâ€”in the second period one year of fallow,
and one year of wheat; in the third period, one year of fallow; whilst in the fourth
period, the first crop failed, and the land was left fallow during the second, third, and
sixth seasons. The yields of nitrogen are, however, in each case, averaged for the
period of 8 years. After the 32nd year, 1878, the land was left fallow for between four and five years.
