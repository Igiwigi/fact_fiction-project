On breaking
open some of the stems, larve of the fly were found surrounded by the débris of the
destroyed tissues, and in this material a few nematodes were discovered which attracted
the writer’s attention because they appeared Tylenchus-like and yet could not be
identified with any of the plant-parasitic or free-living Tylenchus species known to the
writer. ;

Most of them were in an ensheathed condition, but one or two fully developed males
were found having caudal ale but lacking any recognisable buccal stylet. The appear-
ance of the ensheathed forms called to mind certain figures by WULKER (10), p. 410,
illustrating the development of Allantonema mirabile, a nematode parasite of the pine
weevil, Hylobius abietis, and the view was tentatively formed that the newly-found
worms were in some way connected with the frit-fly, possibly as parasites of it. This
view received support from the fact that none of them were observed in dissections of
healthy stems, although specimens of certain free-living nematodes were found in these. Several more affected stems were opened up and from many, but not all, of them the
new worms were obtained. By June 5 it was clear that the male worms always lacked
a mouth stylet, whilst the females were provided with a comparatively massive one.
