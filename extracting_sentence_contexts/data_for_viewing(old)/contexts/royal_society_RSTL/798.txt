by Mr. CLirrT and Mr. GaTcomse, This experiment de-
cides the question respecting the structure of the net-work ;
since now the channels are filled with injection, their shape,
size, and mode of ramification admit of every one examining
them for himself; and one of the slices of the coagulum,
in which this structure is seen, I have been able to pre-
serve in spirit, and two others in oil of turpentine, so that
the originals, as well as the drawings, are brought before
the Society.* As the injection could only fill the spaces from
which the carbonic acid gas was extracted, it cannot be
doubted that the channels were formed by the gas.

Having brought these facts in proof of channels being
formed in coagulated blood out of the body, and of their
depending upon the evolvement of the carbonic acid gas
contained in the blood, it next became necessary to ascertain
whether coagula of blood deposited in the abdomen under-
went the same change. To determine this point, I wounded
one of the smaller branches of the mesenteric artery of a

blood, are deposited in the Collection of the Royal College of Surgeons in Lin»
