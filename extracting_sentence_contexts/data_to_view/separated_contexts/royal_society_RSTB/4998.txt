Examination showed that the mother cell
wall is usually considerably thickened at these stages. Possibly this hampers the
penetration of the fixative with the result that the fixation is poor. A further difficulty
which has limited the number of species for which results have been obtained is due
to the fact that the sporogenous tissue is sometimes abortive, and in the young flower-
buds this is only brought to light after sectioning. On the whole, standard and medium strengths of chromacetic gave the most uniformly
good results ; ALLEN’s modification of Bourn’s fixative gave excellent results for some
species but was worthless for others. Since the idea of the research was to cover a wide range of plants in this Natural
Order, it was obviously not possible to compare in all species the effects of the use of
different fixatives.
