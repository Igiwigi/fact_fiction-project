In the following subsections, we explore the parameter values for which a small periodic
forcing can restore the high-amplitude oscillations. To achieve our goal, we start analysing, in
the parameter space ({2,t), the interaction between the damping parameter pz and the forcing
amplitude F. Then, for fixed 4 and t values, we study the (2,F) parameter space to evaluate
their effect on the oscillations amplitude. Here, we are mainly interested in Region IV for
p € [0.025, 0.04], for which the oscillations disappear and the fractalization is pronounced. Results
are presented in different subsections depending on which parameters are swept.

(a) Effect of the frequency of the forcing

As introduced before, we start analysing the (2,r) parameter space to study the impact of a
small periodic forcing amplitude, F = 0.02, for fixed damping parameter values. In fact, in figure 5
the forcing frequency @ is varied for four values of 1. Remember that for = 0.02, when F =0,
the yellow amplitude basin is still present and the fractalization of the basins only begins at its
boundary. On the other hand, for 4 = 0.05 most of the yellow basin has disappeared. Therefore,
we can see that by adding the forcing for the first case, the dynamics does not barely change
(figure 5a), except for a widening at around 2 = 1. On the other hand, by taking a look to figure 4
