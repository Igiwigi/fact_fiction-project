With the right hand I divided the electrical nerve wi
a single stroke of a pair of sharp scissors. To my great surprise, I experienced
shock in my left hand which was of a distinctly multiple character, I performed thi
experiment on three separate occasions, and am now led to think it meant primary,
secondary, tertiary, &¢., responses. The fact of my not obtaining any evidence
such responses in my previous work would be probably due, first, to the less active
condition of the winter fish; secondly, to my not suspecting the existence of, and
not carefully looking for, second and third apices in the electrical curve (a factor
great importance in rheotome work); and, thirdly, to my using a less delica
instrument and too long a period of galvanometer closure. This must explain why
did not then find what I obtained now with great ease, the evidence that th
electrical curve of the response of the nerve organ preparation to single excitation o
its nerve is, in vigorous fish, always multiple in character, the apex of the primary
response being followed after an interval of 1/100” by a second rise, and its apex by
a third rise, and so on. In the following experiments the circuit was arranged as in fig. 1, but the secondary.
coil was not included in the galvanometer circuit, it being connected with a pair of .
platinum electrodes upon which the nerve of the nerve organ preparation was placed. |
