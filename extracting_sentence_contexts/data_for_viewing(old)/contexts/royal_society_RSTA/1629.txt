Remark 4.2. Even if h ¢ C*(R) in part (ii), : D(S;) > L? is not Fréchet differentiable at 0. See
example 3.1 in [5]. Condition (G) alone ensures that g: D(S;) > L? is Hadamard differentiable at
0 with 9/(0) =0.

Remark 4.3. For t €(0,2/(2+5z)) the operator S; has more than one eigenvalue in the
interval (0, t) the exact number as a function of t being given in proposition 4.10 of [6]. The
proof of theorem 4.1 shows that all eigenvalues in (0,4 — tg) are points of global bifurcation
in (—0o, t — tg) x D(St) for the equation S;u + N(u) + (uv) =Au and that these are the only
bifurcation points in that interval. More precisely, from theorem 3.8 it follows that, if the
component associated with an eigenvalue yw in (0,4 — tg) does not have one of the properties
(a) and (b), then it contains a point (4,0) where A # w is another eigenvalue of S; in (0, 4 — tg). In
fact, this third possibility does not occur but excluding it requires a study of the nodal properties
of solutions. These issues are treated in [18] where (4.1) is replaced by the more general form
studied in [5]. The discussion of problem (4.4) in the next section provides an example of what is
involved.

Proof. (i) Suppose that neither (a) nor (b) is satisfied. Choose c<d< } — tg such that c<
inf p(C) < wr <sup p(C) <d. Next choose ¢ € (0, eG — ¢, —d)) and consider X = D(S;) with the

norm defined by ||u|| = (lulz, +6 Srul|?,}, noting that it is equivalent to the norm || - ||. Since


|| - || is the graph norm of ¢5;, it follows from corollary 5.6 of [3] (with ~ =0, a = —oo and B = F)
that 1 4+ 1
