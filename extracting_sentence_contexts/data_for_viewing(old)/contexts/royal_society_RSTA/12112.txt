A In this respect the variations of surface tension and of electrical conductivity
behave similarly. Both are affected when the film is disturbed by the passage of an
electrical current.

On referring to Table XIV. we observe that two of the values of the ratio of the
electrical to the true thickness (r), viz., those which correspond to the thicknesses
388 and 314 p.p. respectively, are inconsistent with the others.

If the table is rearranged in the order in which the experiments were performed,
these facts gain significance. The exact sequence of events was as follows :—

Current from 20 cells sent down the film before the measurement was made :

(1) T (true thickness) = 641 p.p., 7 = 1°66.
