In order that the first term should be positive and dominate the others, we must have

d—b>0, 14éd<a, 14+6<20.

These three conditions are in fact consequences of (3-5
The argument then proceeds as in (i) and leads to (3°52

). Since we now have d> 1, the

product remains bounded as s-> 00, so that we can write
,-1(6) <A,
where H’ isa constant. It follows that the general term in (3-38) or in (3-39) is majorized by

MM. =comst.s? <7,
whence =M;< 00,
because a—b>1. This concludes the proof of the theorem.
In theorem 7 the complete and modified sections have been treated together. If we
