This model is also of interest, because it is used for non-perturbative studies of the Higgs
mass bounds in lattice simulations [34-37]. The chiral gauge structure of the standard model is so


far not accessible on the lattice, but this chiral model suffices to address quantitative questions,
while extrapolating to the full standard model with the aid of perturbation theory. In fact, the
same mechanism for relaxing the conventional lower bound by means of higher-order operators
that we discovered for the Z) model is also active in this chiral model [13,14]; the corresponding
plot upon an inclusion of a ~d3,a(b* 6) operator looks identical to figure 1b; see fig. 4 in [14]. The existence of this mechanism is also confirmed by lattice studies [38-41], corroborating the
functional RG studies. The chiral model nevertheless has a technical disadvantage, as the chirally broken (Fermi)
phase necessarily goes along with the appearance of massless Goldstone modes.
