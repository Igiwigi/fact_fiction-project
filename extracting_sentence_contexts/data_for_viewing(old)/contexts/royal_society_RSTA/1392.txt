for both patient experience and cost considerations. Accordingly, undersampling of MRI data
in the Fourier domain is used to improve scanning efficiency but leads to blurring and aliasing
artefacts for the reconstructed images.

Consequently, various reconstruction methods have been developed to reduce aliasing
artefacts and recover high fidelity images such as parallel imaging [1,2] and compressed sensing
(CS) [3]. However, parallel imaging is usually affected by the coil geometry factor (g-factor) [4,5]
under higher acceleration factors resulting in a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio. By contrast,
CS algorithms can restore original data from undersampled k-space by exploiting the sparsity
of an unknown image in the total variation (TV) [6,7] or wavelet [8] transform domains, and
incoherent sampling schemes such as Gaussian random or Poisson disc sampling are usually
required. These CS studies focused on designing new objective functions and optimization
algorithms, but they ignored the fact that the reconstruction process was computationally
inefficient and required a significant amount of iterations to converge.

Recently, deep learning has been widely used in medical image processing, such as
disease classification [9-13], anatomic segmentation [14-19], organ registration [20-22] and
lesion detection [23-25]. Besides, emerging studies based on deep learning have reported
promising results to reconstruct high-quality MRI images from the undersampled acquisition.
Wang et al. [26] first used the convolutional neural networks (CNN) for MRI reconstruction, which
mapped between the undersampled MR images to fully sampled reconstruction. Jin et al. [27
proposed a U-net based FBPConvNet to solve the inverse problems in biomedical imaging
with residual learning. Schlemper et al. [28] introduced a deep network architecture, which
formed a cascade of CNNs for reconstructing MR images from undersampled data. Lv et al. [29
used the stacked convolutional auto-encoders based strategy to remove streaking artefacts from
