Complementarity is better exemplified by complementarities of space-time coordination
and the application of momentum or energy conservation laws. These complementarities
are correlative to the uncertainty relations and establish Bohr’s interpretation of then. The
uncertainty relations, AqAp=h (where q is the coordinate, p is the momentum in the
corresponding direction), only prohibit the simultaneous exact measurement of both variables,
always possible, at least ideally, in classical physics, and allowing one to maintain causality
there. The uncertainty relations make these measurements complementary: mutually exclusive
yet allowing us to performing either of them at any moment in time. Indeed, in Bohr’s
view, one not only cannot measure both variables simultaneously but also cannot define them
simultaneously.

Complementarity is, thus, as a reflection of the fact that, in a radical departure from classical
physics or relativity, the behaviour of quantum objects of the same type, say, electrons, is not


governed by the same physical law in all contexts. On the other hand, the mathematical formalism 8 |
of QM offers correct probabilistic or statistical predictions (no other predictions are, again,

possible) in all contexts. This situation also responsible for and defines contextuality, which is a 3
statistical concept, as is, | argue, complementarity when used in QM, correlatively to an RWR-type 1S
view. Speaking of ‘physical law’ here requires caution, because, in Bohr’s interpretation, there is : gS
no physical law representing this behaviour, even no probabilistic law concerning the outcomes 12

of individual experiments, if one adopts a statistical, rather than a Bayesian, view. One might,
