This choice introduces non-zero elements in the residuals [8
covariance matrix, (2‚Äù);j =(2");i #0, and limits us from using (2.9) to solve the disconnected [3
model. As done before, we neglect the newly introduced off-diagonal elements and solve the
model using (2.9) anyway, using (2.7) to evaluate the covariance matrix and then discarding
the off-diagonal elements. This procedure is justified by the fact that, in this way, we can
quantify instantaneous causality as the error in prediction we commit when neglecting one of
the instantaneous couplings. Note that our procedure can be carried out in multivariate systems
and the corresponding instantaneous causality measure can be conditioned on the other variables
in the system. We denote the time domain instantaneous causality measure we get from (2.4)
as Fx;-xjlxi,1 and the frequency domain one as f;;.x; xis) (w).
