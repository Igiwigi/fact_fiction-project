A single RSN that corresponds to those areas is not
likely to be identified. Instead, RSNs that represent motor net-
works, visual networks and others (probably involving
parietal areas) together will represent the task induced acti-
vation pattern. It was in fact recently shown that it is indeed
possible to predict the activation patterns invoked during
task performance from the resting-state data, and it is possible
to do this on an individual basis [114]. Based on the publically released 3 T rfMRI data from the
HCP, significant biological conclusions have already been pub-
lished. Investigating the relationship between individual
subjects’ functional connectomes and 280 behavioural and
demographic measures ina single holistic multivariate analysis,
Smith et al. [115] identified one strong mode of population cov-
ariation along a single ‘positive—negative’ axis-linking lifestyle,
demographic and psychometric measures to each other and toa
specific pattern of brain connectivity.
