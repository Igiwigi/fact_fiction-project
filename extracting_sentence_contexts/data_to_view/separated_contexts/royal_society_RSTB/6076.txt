Despite its
size, fig. 18, the peduncle sis soon lost in the tegmentum. It was not possible
to trace any fibres to the central grey matter which Tsar regards as their probable
destination. The relation to the medial lemniscus is of interest in view of the fact
that some authors have suggested the passage of gustatory fibres from the lemniscus
to the mamillary body by way of the peduncle. The Tractus Mamillo-Tegmentalisâ€”This tract arises from the medial nucleus of the
mamillary body and runs caudally with the peduncle of the corpus mamillare. Some of its fibres end in the ventral tegmental nucleus, the remainder pass on
to the tegmentum.
