Analysis of the Curves of Circular Dichroism. In accordance with the theoretical deductions of Kun, we find that the “ dissymmetry
factor” g, instead of remaining constant in the range of wave-lengths covered by the
first absorption band, increases in an approximately linear manner as the wave-length

decreases, and is, in fact, roughly proportional to the frequency, thus indicating that
the whole band is governed by a single characteristic frequency. It has, however,
already been shown, in §8 above, that the molecular extinction coefficients of all

the xanthates of this series can be represented to a very close approximation by the
expression
