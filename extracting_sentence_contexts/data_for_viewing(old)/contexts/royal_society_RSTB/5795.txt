The diagram represents an isolation of I,, but if the numbering of all the primordia

is changed by one step, it will represent equally well an isolation of P,. The vertical

cylinder is supposed to have been cut, in order to spread it out flat. On account of the
shift of the growing-point, the distances of points in the diagram from the old and the
new growing-points are represented by their distances from the lines B A B and BtA1B!
respectively. The amount of shift of the growing-point is represented by the distance
A A? or B B!, which is the distance between the above two lines at 0° and 180°. Since

ascertained, it is introduced only to illustrate the argument, and, in view of the many
difficulties, it is naturally not claimed that it is a completely exact representation of the
phyllotaxis system. he positions which would normally have been occupied by I,
and by the stipule of I, are shown by dotted lines, and their actual positions by
