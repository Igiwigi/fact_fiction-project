requisite for the psychological change only in highly
susceptible individuals. This was also supported by the fact
that individuals responding by equal PRL responses to both
drugs also did not differ in smoking urge in the lisuride
and fluphenazine condition. This indicates that manipula-
tions of the TM systems by stimulation and blockade
cannot only help to trace specific temperament-related sus-
ceptibilities, but also provides some information on the
question under which conditions a possibly causal relation-
ship between the biochemical and psychological indicator
of TM activity may become manifest.
