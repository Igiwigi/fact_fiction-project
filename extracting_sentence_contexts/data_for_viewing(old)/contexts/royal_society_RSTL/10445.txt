5 If this be the actual arrangement, then it is seen that the current which travels round

Sthe circuit from zine through acid to copper, is in opposition to the E.M.1. between the

Sine and acid, while the M.1. is related to the current in the ordinary way. The energy

Swill therefore pass outwards from there along the level surfaces. In fact, the medium

Sbetween the zinc and acid behaves like the medium between the plates of the condenser

Ain case No. (2), and it seems possible that the chemical action produces continually

fresh © electric displacement ” from acid towards zinc which yields as rapidly as it is

formed, the energy of the displacement moving out sideways.
