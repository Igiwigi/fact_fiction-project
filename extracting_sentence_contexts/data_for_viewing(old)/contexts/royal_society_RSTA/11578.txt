THE principal objects of this investigation have been to examine the part played by
the surrounding gas in the production of ions by hot metals and to discover, if
possible, the mechanism by which the positive ions originate. In what follows,
previous work on ionisation by hot metals will not be described, except in so far as it
bears directly on the questions investigated, since the historical part of the subject
has been fully treated in previous papers by the writer,* and others.

The present communication deals chiefly with the emission of positive ions from hot
platinum, as earlier work has yielded much more information concerning the negative
ionisation, In 1901 the writer+ showed that a great number of facts in connection
with the negative ionisation from hot metals could be explained by supposing that
the electrons, of which the ions consist, were produced in the metal itself, from which
they escaped by virtue of their kinetic energy. This theory makes the negative
ionisation a function only of the metal surface and its temperature, and therefore
independent of the nature and pressure of the surrounding gas, except in so
far as this may have the effect of modifying the nature of the metallic surface.
H. A. Wusont has confirmed this part of the theory by showing that the negative
leak, except when ionisation by collision occurs, has the same value in air, nitrogen,
and water vapour over a wide range of pressures. Wu1tson also showed, however,
that hydrogen greatly modifies the negative leak. ‘The experiments in the present
paper seem to show that the effect of hydrogen is due to some change it produces in
the platinum surface ; its abnormal behaviour is probably bound up with its electro-
