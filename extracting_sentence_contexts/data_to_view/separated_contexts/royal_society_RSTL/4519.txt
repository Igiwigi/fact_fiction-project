Its amount was less than I expected, though
guano caunot be regarded as a favourable example of the usual effects of putrefaction
on a complex nitrogenous substance, as the chief portion of the nitrogen contained
in it existed from the first in the state of ammoniacal salts. Guano, however, in
addition to ammonia, also contains a quantity of volatile organic bases. From the facts which have been now stated, I think it may be pretty safely

assumed, that * whenever ammonia is generated in large quantity from complex, either
animal or vegetable substances, it is always accompanied by the Formation of a larger
or smaller amount of volatile organie bases.” If therefore researches similar to the
present are actively prosecuted, and if the seeds and leaves of the various genera of
plants especially are snbjected to these or 8imilar processes, it seems not unreason-
able to expect that the number of the volatile organic alkaloids will ere long be
considerably increased.
