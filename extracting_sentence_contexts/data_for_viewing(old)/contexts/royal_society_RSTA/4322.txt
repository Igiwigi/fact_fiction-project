Appendix A. Degree of nonlinearity

Consider an IMF with a constant amplitude a(t) = 1. Let oF (t) be the phase function in the EMD
method and 05(t) be the corresponding phase function in the model with the shape function.
We assume that the shape function has been normalized so that its amplitude is bounded by 1,
ie. max; s(t) = 1 and min; s(t) = —1. Denote $(t) = arccos(s(t)).

Using the fact that both cos 6®(#) and s(05(t)) are the representations of the same signal, we
have

cos 6=(t) = s(05(t)),
which implies that
oF) = 9(°(8).-
Thus, the instantaneous frequency in the original EMD method can be computed as follows:

F= 59H = 8 PMO, (Al)

and the mean frequency over one wave cycle, IF,, becomes
