(i) Flat surfaces with various wettability and beetle-inspired surfaces at 45째and 0째 inclination angles

To study the effect of various wettability and heterogeneity on flat surfaces, water collection
rate per unit area was measured at a 45째 inclination. The date are shown in figure 19a.
Superhydrophobic and beetle-inspired surfaces were prepared using 10 um and 7nm particles.
The size of the particles affects the surface morphology and droplet interaction. Figure 19b shows
differences in size and shape of droplets on various surfaces after 1h [9].

The data show that the higher the repellency (higher CA) on the flat surface, the higher
the water collection. The decreasing order of the water collection rate per unit area on flat
surfaces with homogeneous wettability is superhydrophobic surface using 10 ym, hydrophobic,
hydrophilic and superhydrophilic. This is attributed to the fact that the higher the repellency,
the more spherical the droplet shape will be, which results in a lower contact area between the
