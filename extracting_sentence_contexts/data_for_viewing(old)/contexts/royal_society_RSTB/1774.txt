The cone which has been described is an isolated specimen; apart from the
peduncle, and the doubtful fragment of stem referred to on p. 19, we have not the
slightest clue, as yet, to the nature of the vegetative organs of the plant which bore
it. The one part which we possess, however—the fructification—is happily the most
important from a taxonomic point of view; so, considering the perfection of its
preservation, we may profitably enter on a discussion of the probable affinities of the
fossil.

The first question which presents itself is this: was Cheirostrobus a Cryptogam or
a Phanerogam? The latter alternative is not one to be rejected off-hand; the
fructification might quite conceivably have been the male cone of a Gymnosperm.
The remarkable morphology of the sporophylls, in fact, at once suggests a comparison
with certain Coniferous strobili. The superior and inferior lobes of the sporophyll,
especially if, as is almost certainly the case, the upper segments be the sporangio-
phores, may well be compared to the ovuliferous and carpellary scales of the
Abietineze. It is true that this would be to compare a male with a female strobilus ;
but it might be theoretically possible to suppose that an organization now limited to
flowers of one sex might in early geological times have extended to those of the
other also.

It is not, however, probable that this comparison amounts to anything more than a
remote analogy. We can hardly compare an early Palzeozoic fossil directly with a
group, which, so far as we know, only makes its appearance well on in the Secondary
period. The Gymnosperms known to us from the older rocks offer no definite points
