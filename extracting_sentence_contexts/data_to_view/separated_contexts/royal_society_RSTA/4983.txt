It was found that the main characteristics of the damage were quite similar to those
produced by normal impacts. However, there was one significant difference; for oblique impacts
the resulting Hertzian cone cracks were not oriented symmetrically to the target’s surface normal. In fact, it was found that as the angle of impact decreased from 90° (i.e. being along the surface
normal) that between the axis of the resulting Hertzian cone fracture and the normal to the impact
surface increased in the projectile’s forward direction. An example of an oblique impact is shown in figure 8. A 2mm diameter tungsten carbide
sphere impacts a polished block of soda-lime glass with the angle between the surface normal and
the projectile impact direction being approximately 60°.
