lacrals, and this may possibly prove to be a feature that really unites them in
spite of the great differences in other respects. But the Echinon√©ide seem to show
a stage in what may be regarded as a secondary method of the production of this
character. :

There is one morphological feature in the ambulacra of the later Pygasteridee
which may possibly serve to link the simplified Spatangid plating with the
inevitably more complex structures that preceded it. Pygaster itself shows an
almost perfect abandonment of plate-complexity towards the peristome (Plate 65,
figs. 3 and 4), and there is reason to believe that the Cretaceous genera Macropygus
and Anorthopygus were even more completely simple in this respect. This may
seem a very small point of resemblance, and insufficient to serve as a basis for
morphogenetic or phylogenetic argument; but the fact remains that the later


AMBULACRUM IN THE ECHINOIDEA HOLECTYPOIDA. 461

Pygasteridee are the only Echinoids of the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous
periods in which a tendency to ambulacral simplification is seen. The Collyritidee
apparently achieved a similar result in Bajocian times. The correspondence in the
structure of the apical system of Anorthopygus and that of the Spatangoida
(see. Hawxins, 1912, a), adds considerably to the bulk of the evidence that makes
reasonable the tentative suggestion that there may be a tendency towards the
Spatangoid type in the simplification of the Pygasterid ambulacrum.
