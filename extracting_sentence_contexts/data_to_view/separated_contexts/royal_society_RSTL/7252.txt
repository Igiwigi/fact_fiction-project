The atomic heat of
water, I, 0, is (4 85) =8'6, and smaller by 7 than that of suboxide of copper, Cuy O,
which was found in the mean to be 15:6; the atomic heat of hydrogen would thus be
4=3:5 less than that of the elements to which copper belongs, as regards its atomic
heat ; hence the former would be 6:4—3:5=2:9, The atomic heat of chloride of ammo-
nium, N H, Cl, has been found to be 20-0 (4 84); the subtraction of the atomic heats for
N+Cl=6:4+6:4=12:8, leaves 7:2 as the atomic heat of 4 H, and therefore 1:7 for that
of H. The atomic heat of nitrate of ammonia, N, H, O,, is 36:4 (4 88); subtracting
therefrom as the atomic heat of N,+0,, the number 27:1, which has previously been fre-
quently mentioned as the atomic heat of oxides BR: O,, we have 9:3 as the atomic heat
of 4H, that is 2:3 for that of H. TI put in the sequel the atomic heat of hydrogen at 23. That oxygen has a smaller atomic heat than 6-4, follows from the fact that the oxygen
compounds of the metals have a considerably smaller atomic heat than the correspond-
ing chlorides, iodides, or bromides. For instance, the atomic heat of the oxides KR Q is
as the mean of the determinations in ( 85 =11-1, while that of the chlorides R Cl and
Þ C1 ({ $4), is 12:8, that of the corresponding bromides 13:9, and of the corresponding
iodides 13:4. 'That of the oxides, R O,, as the mean of the determinations in ( 85, of
Mn O,, Sn O,, and Ti O, is 13:7, while that of the chlorides RCl, ({ $5) is 18:5, and
of the iodides R1,=19:4 Taking the atomic heat of the other elements, which are
contained in the following compounds, at 6:4, the atomic heat of oxygen, as deduced
from the atomic heat of the oxides R © (11:1 in the mean), is =4-7; as deduced from
the oxides R, O, (27:1 as the mean of the oxides of this formula previously frequently
mentioned), it, is =4-8; from the aboye oxides, R O, (13:7 in the mean), it is = 37; it is
found (compare 4 88) from K As O, (25:3) to be 4:1; from Pb, As, O, (65:4) to be 4:2;
from K C10, (24-8) to be 4-0; from K C10, (26:3) to be 3:4; from K Mn ©, (283) to

be 3'9.
