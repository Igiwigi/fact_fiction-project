SprorrRA OF THE BESSEMER FLAME. Description of the Spectrum of the Bessemer Flame, as photographed at Crewe,
January, 1898, at the Steel Works of the London and North-Western Railway
Company. The lines of the alkali metals .appear, and are, in fact, the only prominent lines
during the first period of the ‘ blow,” when the silicon is being oxidised and slags are
in course of formation. During the second period, or the “ boil,” the flame exhibits a
continuous spectrum of bright rays, overlying which is a number of bright bands ;
some of these appear to be degraded towards the least refrangible rays, others do not
appear to be degraded, but are bounded by lines, or by very narrow bands, possibly
by the sharp edges of bands. There does not appear to be any distinct fading away
of bands in the direction of the least refrangible rays more than towards the blue.
