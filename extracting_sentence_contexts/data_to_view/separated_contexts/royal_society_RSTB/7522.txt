The main vessels are the internal carotid artery,
the external carotid artery, the ascending pharyngeal artery, the ramus anastomoticus,
the arteria anastomotica and the external ophthalmic artery. The situation of the carotid
rete in relation to this basic pattern is different in the cat and in the artiodactyls, but the
difference may be cursorily explained as a shift along the line of the arteria anastomotica. The fact that there is a basic pattern of the major vessels suggests that a more primitive
vessel plays an important part in the formation of this vascular system. If the pattern in
the rat, as described in this paper, and that seen in the hedgehog and in the mole (Tandler
1899) are studied, it is evident that the stapedial artery is still important in the adult of
these species (figure 9/4). It seems probable, therefore, that the variations which are seen
in the basic arrangements of different species are due to modifications of the stapedial
artery at an earlier stage.
