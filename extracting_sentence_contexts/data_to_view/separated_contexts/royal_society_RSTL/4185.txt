When this is laid open by a
horizontal section (Plate V. fig. 6), it is seen to consist of a series of concentric zones,
the cells of which alternate with each other, like those of the simpler type (q 17.). The cells are nsaally circular (or nearly 80) in form ; but seem to differ consider-
ably in size, even in different parts of the same zone. Their borders, however, very
commonly present a funnel-like aspect; and thus we perceive that the diameter of
the cavity is liable to yary, according to the part of it which the section happens to
traverse,—a fact which becomes more obvious when vertical sections are examined ;
for it is then seen (Plate VI. figs. 7, 8, 9) that each columnar cell is narrowed by
constrictions at intervals, s0 as to divide it imperfectly into a series of segments
vertically superposed one upon another. The number of these segments varies
according to the thickness of the disk; 80 that it is anything but constant, either
in different individuals, or in different parts of the same. Moreover, it may be often
observed that the columns neither always pass from end to end in a straight line, nor
maintain a complete isolation from each other (Plate VIII. figs. 1, 2); an inoscula-
tion of two columns not being unfrequent, and more rarely a fusion of two columns
into one.
