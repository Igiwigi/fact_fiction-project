although at that height the attenuation of the air probably surpasses that of most
artificial vacua.

On the other hand, it is most difficult to believe that the residual air in a Sprengel
vacuum, where the gauge and barometer are appreciably level, can exert, when gently
warmed by the finger, an upward force capable of instantly overcoming the inertia
of a mass of matter weighing several grains, and setting it in motion. It must be
remembered that the upward current supposed to do this is simply due to the dimi-
nished weight of a portion of the gas, caused by its increase in yolume by the heat
applied.

75. Another argument in favour of the air-current explanation can be drawn from
the fact that when a light beam, having equal weights of pith and platinum s8uspended
at the ends, is sealed up in a Sprengel vacuum, the application of warmth below causes
the pith to rise more readily than the platinum (62); the pith obviously offers a much
more extended surface than the platinum does to the impact of air-particles.

"This, moreover, is not ar isolated instance. Throughout the whole of these experi-
ments the law appears to be that the force exerted is in proportion to the extent of
surface exposed (48, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67) rather than in proportion to the mass. Much
