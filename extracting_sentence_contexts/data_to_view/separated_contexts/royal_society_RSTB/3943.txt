VI. Periodic Breathing. The fact that at high altitudes the breathing tends to become periodic or of the
“ Cheyne-Stokes” type was discovered by Mosso, who made many valuable observa-
tions on the subject, and published a number of tracings.* Unfortunately, he was led
to very mistaken conclusions as to the cause of nearly all of the peculiar respiratory
phenomena met with at high altitudes. Periodic breathing appeared at one time or another in all of us. In HENDERSON it
was constantly present during sleep to the end of our stay, and often during the
waking hours, particularly in the first days.
