The direct assignment of integral balances demands fewer assumptions, in fact, and
allows to try to prove Cauchy-type theorems. However, since we consider M as a
nonlinear manifold, which is the general unifying choice, prescribing an independent
integral balance of micro-actions would be highly questionable formally. We would write,
in fact, integrals involving integrands taking values on the cotangent bundle of M, which
is anonlinear space (unless M coincides with a linear space) and is the target space of the
integrand, so the definition of the integral itself would be questionable. Moreover, if we
consider M to be coincident with a linear space, we can see that such a balance would be
essentially superfluous, as shown in a theorem below. When we adopt the principle of virtual power (as in [38]), we are directly prescribing
the weak form of the point-wise balance equations, the form used in computational
procedures.
