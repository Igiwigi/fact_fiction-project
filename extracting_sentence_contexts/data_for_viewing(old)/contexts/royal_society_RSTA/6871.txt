is typical. Substituting from the latter on the right-hand side of (iii), and using the
approximation

4254 V4w), — (V40)9 = F (Vow)o+ + (v)
we find that

: [ at(W40)9+5 ° (5w) |= = LX, (w,) +22, (wy) — 102, (w,) +42. (33)

15. This derivation of (32) is not entirely convincing, because terms of order at
(and so comparable with its left-hand side) were disregarded in formulating the five
relations of type (ii). But we can, working backwards, verify that the terms neglected
n (32) are in fact of order a’ at least.

In Part III, § 6, the summation &, y(w) related to N points symmetrically grouped
round a central point at a distance a, one point lying on the reference line / = 0. If,
maintaining the symmetrical grouping, we rotate the points so that one lies on the line
0 = f, then a similar argument yields the relation

ay Zan (t) = 4p (2) +Ay (a) cos NB-+Ayy (2) cos 2NB-+

+B, (a) sin Nf+Byy (a) sin2QNB-+...

—a generalization of (4) of the earlier paper. In particular, when Nf = 7 we have
zen (w) = Ay (a) — Ay (a) + Any (a) —..., ete. (34)
