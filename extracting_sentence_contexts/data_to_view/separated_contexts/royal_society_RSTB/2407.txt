Trichomanes, sp.). The sporangium, and its annulus and dehiscence, point clearly
towards the Gleicheniacese and Schizzeaceze ; and though the habit is different from
these Ferns, the structure of the creeping rhizome shows some degree of resemblance. The similarity of position of the annulus, and constancy of orientation are important,
especially when taken with the very peculiar facts of induration. For as we have
seen, the distal side of the annulus is indurated, while the proximal can still be
followed, though it is commonly thin-walled ; but occasionally single cells, or groups
of cells, of the proximal side are also indurated : these cannot be functionally active,
since they do not form a connected series. In them I think we can only see a
decadent vestige of a completely indurated annulus, and conclude that Loasoma was
derived from ancestors with a complete oblique annulus, probably with a median
dehiscence.
