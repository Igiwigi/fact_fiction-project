The case of so-called ‘ ionised ” crystal-structures, e.g. the alkali halides, is rather
different, since in them it is impossible to localise the molecules and treat them as
separate entities built together with suitable relative orientations. The crystal is an
equilibrium distribution of positive and negative parts and as such is best considered
from the point of view of the theory of coincidence operations, that is, by aid of the
symmetry elements alone. For instance, in rock-salt (supposing the structure possesses
full, 48-fold, cubic symmetry), we cannot argue from the fact that there are four mole-
cules in the face-centred unit cell that each molecule has 48-fold symmetry because,
in the first place, the molecules cannot be localised and, in the second, if they could
be localised they would clearly possess a much lower symmetry. But examination of
fig. 225 will bring out how, in spite of this apparent anomaly, the whole structure is
subject to the particular combination of symmetry elements (O,°) there depicted. Similarly we can readily see how ammonium chloride, with only one molecule of low
symmetry per unit cube, gives rise to the highly symmetrical arrangement shown in
fig. 207.
