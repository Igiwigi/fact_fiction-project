Thus Bagnold (1947) has found a strong forward velocity near the bottom and a
weaker backward velocity at higher levels—the exact opposite of the Stokes velocity dis-
tribution. Other observers (Caligny 1878; King 1948) have found a forward drift both

& near the bottom and near the free surface, with a backward drift between.
a It appears, therefore, that some assumption on which Stokes’s theory is based is not valid.
8 Now, in the theory of perfect fluids it is supposed that at a solid boundary the fluid may
2 ‘slip’, i.e. that it may have a tangential velocity relative to the boundary. In fact, however,
& the particles of fluid in contact with the boundary must have the same velocity as the
< boundary itself; on the bottom, for example, they must be at rest. But quite near the bottom
6 the fluid is observed to be in motion with velocities comparable to that in the interior of
50 the fluid, so that in general there must be a strong velocity gradient near the bottom. This
sb implies that there is in fact strong vorticity in the neighbourhood of the bottom; and it
‘ will be seen that, even if the vorticity is confined to a layer of infinitesimal thickness, the
‘6 total amount of vorticity must still be finite.
