CRYSTALLIZATION PHENOMENA IN POLYMERS. I 9

processes are rapid. The flat portion of the curve between 220 and 230° CG may be con-
nected with the fact that the heat of crystallization raises the temperature of the crystal-
lizing sample by as much as 4° C above that of the surrounding Silicone oil. This was
ascertained by inserting a thin thermocouple in the polymer in the annular space in the
gauze container. A similar phenomenon has been described by Tamman (1926) in non-
polymeric crystallizing systems. Above 230° G there is no difference in the temperature
of the bath medium and the crystallizing sample. A similar plateau is not observed at
temperatures around 130° C, where the rates of crystallization are of the same order;
this is of course due to the fact that elevation of temperatures in this range will result in an
enhanced rate of crystallization.
