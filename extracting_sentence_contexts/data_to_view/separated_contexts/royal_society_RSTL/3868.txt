We have established this fact moreover experimentally. Sulphacetic acid,
prepared by the action of anhydrous sulphuric acid upon glacial acetic acid, furnished
without difficulty disulphometholic acid, when again treated with sulphuric acid. A
Similar observation had in fact been made already by M. MeLssNs, This chemist, in
his researches upon the sulphacetates, appears in s0me sort to have anticipated the
existence of the disulphometholates. He remarks that he once found in the mother-
liquor obtained from the preparation of sulphacetate of silver, a crystalline salt the
composition of which he represents by the formula
