G= {gigh : p,q â‚¬ Z} is not discrete. However, as shown in figure 5a, by simply cutting off the
powers p,q, large regions of the cylinder become locally objective structures with various size
molecules. In fact, by carefully choosing the powers p,q one can arrange that there is a seam
on the cylinder parallel to the axis e, and each atom away from this seam sees the same local
environment, figure 5b. And, curiously, the atoms right next to the seam (on one side) also all see
the same environment. One can arrange also that the seam is helical, figure 6b.
