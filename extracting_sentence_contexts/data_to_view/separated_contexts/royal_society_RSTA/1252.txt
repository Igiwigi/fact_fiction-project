Thus a fixed point of No is a solution of the local BVP (3.1). Using some ideas from Webb & Infante [1], the BVP (1.1) and (1.2) has a solution if and only if
there exists a solution in C![0, 1] for the following integral equation:

u(t) = yo(t)Bolu] + 71 ()Bi[u] + Nou(t). (3.7)
Thus solutions of the BVP (1.1) and (1.2) can be obtained from fixed points of the operator N
defined by
Nu(t) = yo(t)Bolu] + 1 (t)Ailu] + Nou(t). (3.8)
As shown in [1], solutions of the BVP (1.1) and (1.2) are also given by fixed points of the operator
N:C! + C! defined by

Nut) = fa — prtabotNoul + Bolles Nou]

and we impose the requirements that
Polvo] < 1, Pilvi] < 1 and D> 0. (3.10)

These requirements ensure that the matrix

has spectral radius r(B) < 1 so that I — B is invertible. The condition r(B) < 1 is in fact necessary in
order that positive solutions can exist, see [14] for details. This gives an explicit form of N. This form is not always the one first found by a direct approach
which often has a sum of terms of opposite signs, e.g. [15,16], but it is particularly convenient for
investigating positive solutions.
