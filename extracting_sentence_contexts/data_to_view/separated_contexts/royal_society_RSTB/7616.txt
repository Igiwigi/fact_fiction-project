There is thus no possibility of mistaking the branchlets bearing
Bensonites as belonging to any other plant present in the sections. I have also traced several
0-1 mm branches upwards through successive transverse sections and have found that they
terminated in Bensonites. Moreover, indirect evidence is provided by the fact that the
stalk of Bensonites and an ultimate branchlet of Stauropteris burntislandica frond are identical
in size and structure. Figure 26, plate 4, shows a megasporangium attached by a short
stalk to a branchlet 0-16 mm in diameter which shows a stoma (s) identical with that
shown in figure 19, plate 2. Figure 27, plate 4, provides another example where a branch
of the Vth order has given out a branch of the VIth order which in its turn bears a mega-
sporangium (sp).
