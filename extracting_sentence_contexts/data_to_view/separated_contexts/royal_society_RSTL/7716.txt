a 114. I revert to the equation which exhibits the {nodal lines (x—w=0, y+z=0),
(x+w=0, y—z2=0) for the purpose of showing that age have respectively no pinch-
points; that is, that in regard to each of them we have j/=0. In fact for the first of

these lines, neglecting the terms which contain z—w, y4+2 conjointly in an order above
the second, the equation may be written
