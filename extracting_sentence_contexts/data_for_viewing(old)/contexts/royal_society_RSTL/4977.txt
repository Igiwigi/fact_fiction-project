8ea80ns of the year in my own neighbourhood (Blackheath), always on small dead
branches of Lime. It belongs to the division Circinate, but the perithecia are more
deeply immersed in the inner bark than is usnal in that division. The ostiola some-
times penetrate through the epidermis, but sometimes remain concealed by it; in the
latter case raising the epidermis into a number of small pustules. When the epidermis
is stripped off, the inner bark is seen to be covered with small, green, circular umbonate
disks, the umbonate appearance being caused by the ostiola, which, as in other Circinate,
are in contact at their apices, and protrude through the exact centre of each of the

green disks. 'The fact that each one, without exception, of the circular masses of
thecia is always crowned by one of these green disks, would seem to point to somethi
more than an accidental connexion between them ; and although it is possible that the
disks might be only a fungoid growth parasitic upon the ostiola of the perithecia, it
s5eems far more probable that they really belong to the latter, forming an integral pox.
tion of their structure. If a very thin vertical section be made passing through the
centre of the mass of ostiola, and consequently through the centre of the disks, it is
seen that the latter are composed of densely packed filamentous tissue, hardly differing,
if at all, from the tissue of which the ostiola are composed. The tissnes moreover are
in actual contact, 80 close that it is hardly possible to distinguish any line of demarca-
tion between the two. Such a section is shown in fig. 11, magnified 45 diameters; and
it must be taken whilst the plants are quite young, for in a later stage, when the ostiola
have become black, hardened and brittle, it could not be made.
