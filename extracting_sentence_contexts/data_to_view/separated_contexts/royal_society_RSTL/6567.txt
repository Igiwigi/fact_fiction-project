The breathing state of inhalation appears to be very persistent, and I have rarely failed
in detecting it when I haye let a drop of water charged with molecules of indigo quietly

repose and action are not dependent on mere mechanical causes, and sponges in a state
of quiescence may be readily stimulated to vigorous action by placing them in fresh cool
sea-water, and especially if it be poured somewhat roughly into the pan and agitated
briskly for a short period; and this will take place even in specimens that have very
recently been in powerful action. No general lay seems to guide the animal in the choice of its periods of action and
repose, and no two sponges appear to coincide entirely in the time or mode of their
actions. In fact, each appears to follow the promptings of its own instinct in the choice
of its periods of feeding and repose. In the littoral sponges there is a third condition of the animal, and that is during
