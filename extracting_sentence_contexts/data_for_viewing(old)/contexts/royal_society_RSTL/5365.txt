temperature segmentation commenced about ten minutes earlier than in those which
had been fecundated, and remained during the first hour in the lower temperature.

These results seem to show, that while the eggs are more rapidly affected, they are
also more certainly impregnated, and the embryos produced in greater numbers at
a higher than at a lower temperature. But it must be borne in mind that the number
of eggs fecundated in these experiments can only be regarded as comparative, and
as mere approximations to what takes place in a state of nature, the experiments
having been made with fluid which had been removed from the body, and con-
siderably diluted with water, more than half an hour before it was employed, and
consequently when its efficacy had been considerably diminished.

'These facts, then, go to confirm the previous conclusions, that the organic force or
vitality of the spermatozoon is of shorter duration than that of the egg ; since, if the
results of these experiments be compared with those obtained from former ones, it
will be seen that the insusceptibility of the egg depends very much more on the
endosmic action of its envelopes after immersion in water, than on any loss of vitality :

further, that the non-fecundation of the egg may depend much more on diminished
vitality and inefficiency of the spermatozoon, than on the insnsceptibility of the egg
itself.
