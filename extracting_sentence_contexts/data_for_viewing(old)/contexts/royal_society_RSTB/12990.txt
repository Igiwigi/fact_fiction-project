reproductive isolation between two allopatric populations [2].
In the presence of gene flow, however, each new incompatible
mutation faces a fitness deficit. Theoretically, a contribution to
local adaptation by each of these mutations can make up for
this deficit. Indeed, it has been shown that the accumulation
of locally adaptive mutations between two parapatric popu-
lations can result in genetic barriers to gene flow of arbitrary
