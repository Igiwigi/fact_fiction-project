After
the maximum action had been reached, a quantity of uninsolated gas, occupying
about 400 millims. of the index tube, was introduced while the light was still on the
mixture. The index came to rest and an inert period of about 1 minute occurred. The acceleration period then set in, but was very much longer than in the case of the
original gas ; in fact, the rate of action was increasing slowly for as long as the index
could be followed, and the maximum action was not attained. This is shown by the
eurve IT, fig. 14, being very much flatter than curve I. If the mixture be left in the dark for some time before illuminating, after fresh gas
has been added, this retarding effect passes off to some extent, and the attainment of
the maximum action is not so gradual.
