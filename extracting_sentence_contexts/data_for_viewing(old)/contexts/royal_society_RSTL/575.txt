employ such a term) appears to have been completed, whilst in
the Bovey coal, and especially in the substance which accom-
- panies it, nature seems to have performed only the half of her
work, and, from some unknown cause, to have stopped in the
middle of her operations. But, by this circumstance, much light
is thrown on the history of bituminous substances ; and the
opinion, that they owe their origin to the organized kingdoms
of nature, especially to that of vegetables, which hitherto has
been supported only by presumptive proofs, seems now, in a
great measure, to be confirmed, although the causes which operate
these changes on vegetable bodies are as yet undiscovered.

Many facts indicate, that time alone does not reduce animal
or vegetable bodies to the state of fossils. In this country, there
are numerous examples of . large quantities of timber, (even
whole forests,) which have been submerged prior to any tradi-
tion, and which nevertheless completely retain their ligneous
characters.* Other local causes and agents must therefore have
been required, to form the varieties of coal and other bituminous
substances. In some instances, (as in the formation of Boyey
coal,) these causes seem to have acted partially and imperfectly,
whilst, in, the formation- of the greater part of the, pit coals,
their operation has been extensive and complete.

In the pit coals, the mineral characters predominate, and the
