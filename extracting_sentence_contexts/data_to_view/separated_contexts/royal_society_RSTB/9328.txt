This new organ is not alien
to the NRC report that was recommending the establishment
of a National Institute of Forensic Science to regulate and
harmonize forensic science in the US. One of its objectives
is to provide recommendations and advice for strengthening
the validity and reliability of the forensic sciences. The
response from the NCFS on the annotated bibliographies
(IWG RDT&E initiative) prepared by the working groups is
rather harsh,’” in particular the lack of relevance to support

and the NIST report:

Recommendation 1: Fingerprint evidence should be recog-
nized as opinion evidence, not fact, and those involved
in the criminal justice system need to assess it as such on
its merits. Recommendation 3: Examiners should discontinue reporting
conclusions on identification or exclusion with a claim
to 100% certainty or on any other basis suggesting that
fingerprint evidence is infallible. Recommendation 9: Features on which examiners rely should
be demonstrable to a lay person with normal eye sight as
observable in the mark.
