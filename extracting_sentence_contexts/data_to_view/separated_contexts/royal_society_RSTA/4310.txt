Then, I went on to tell you that the expression
log N was ‘just a special case’ of equation (2.1). But I think I need to clear up what happened here. In §2, I talked about the fact that you really are given some information when a mathematician
defines a random variable. Like, for example, in equation (3.1) above. If you know nothing about
the random variable, you do not know the p;.
