Hereafter we shall find
the influence of this effect in the formation of brushes (1435.) ; and it is not impossible
that we may trace it producing the jagged spark and the forked lightning.

1421. The characters of the electric spark in different gases vary, and the varia-
tion may be due simply to the effect of the heat evolved at the moment. But it may
also be due to that specific relation of the particles and the electric forces which I
have assumed as the basis of a theory of induction ; the facts do not oppose such a
view; and in that view, the variation strengthens the argument for molecular action,
as it would seem to show the influence of the latter in every part of the electrical
effect (1423, 1454.).

1422. The appearances of the sparks in different gases have often been observed
and recorded*, but I think it not out of place to notice briefly the following results;
they were obtained with balls of brass, (platina snrfaces would have been better,) and
at common pressures. In air, the sparks have that intense light and bluish colour
which are 80 well known, and often have faint or dark parts in their course, when the
quantity of electricity passing is not great.
