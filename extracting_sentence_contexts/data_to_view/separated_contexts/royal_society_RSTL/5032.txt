The sphere whose radius is unity will be changed
Zinto an ellipsoid whose axes are Az, BB, Cy; and the axes of the other ellipsoids will
S be parallel and proportional to these. By

&is an important determining element. If we assume »' to denote what @ becomes in
Z consequence of the distortion, it may be easily seen that o' is a distributive function of
8» and Az+BB+Cy; and from this fact a number of curious symbolical relations

= than my immediate purpose requires. (106.)
