Additionally, these studies typically include
many crosses to get large sample sizes, which use multiple
replicate females. However, most studies do not account for
this source of variation. In fact, most studies report sample
size in reference to the number of progeny rather than the
number of F; parents. Based on the guidelines of experimental
design we suggest above, the experimental analysis needs to
be equally adjusted to account for the sources of variation
appropriately. We do not recommend using simple summary
statistics, or independent tests (e.g. xâ€™).
