The basic idea is to modify the
minimizer (vj, @),) of Fy, by wrinkling where necessary, and estimate the increase in the energy
due to wrinkling. Using (3.14), the amount of arclength we need to waste at each circle (together
with the optimal length scale of wrinkling) can be read off from (vj, wp). Nevertheless, learning
from the proof of the lower bound we anticipate that we should not really use wrinkling with the
optimal period, as it will be costly to change this period too often—B(r) would then be too large
(in fact of order O(1)). Anyway, as we explained in §2, it is not necessary for the wavenumber k
to take the ‘optimal’ value att yyh at radius r. Rather, what matters is that |hk/r — a! ¢/kh| be at
most of order h/?.
