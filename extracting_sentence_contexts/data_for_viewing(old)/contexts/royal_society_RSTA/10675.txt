The y? terms are therefore identical in this and in the true solution, but the first
term which represents the additional deflection of the central axis of the beam, and
which is sometimes spoken of as the shearing deflection, is less than in the true
solution, being (13\’ + 16)/20 (\’ +p), that is (424 + 32)/(60 + 40) of that
given by the double cantilever solution. This fraction comes to be “74 for uni-con-
stant isotropy.

If we assume what I have called Love's fixing condition, the shearing deflection
disappears entirely.

The true solution shows us, therefore, that it is permissible in this case to use the
double cantilever as an artifice to obtain the solution, provided we adopt, at the
section of fictitious severance, a fixing condition intermediate between those of Love
and pE SAINT-VENANT, but nearer to the latter. In other words, a central isolated
load does actually introduce a sharp bend,

§ 13. Value of the Deflection when b is not small and the Beam is Doubly
Supported.

Suppose the beam rests on two knife-edge supports A, B (fig. i.) at a distance 27
apart, and a weight W is borne by another knife-edge which presses on the upper
part of the beam at C.
