cancer metabolism, oxidative stress, Activation of oncogenes and loss of tumour suppressors are mediated by DNA

Peto’s paradox, body mass, metabolic rate mutations, chromosomal instability or epigenetic alterations, thereby driving
tumorigenesis [1]. The replicating genome is constantly exposed to mutagens,
such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from mitochondria or ultraviolet
and gamma radiation from the cosmos, that damage DNA, cause imbalance in
nucleotide pools that results in DNA replication stress, and alter levels of metab-
olites involved in modifying the epigenome (e.g. acetyl-CoA, S-adenosyl
methionine, «-ketoglutarate) that result in misregulation of gene expression. As
such, unrepaired mutagenic errors could be propagated to daughter cells and con-
tribute to the development of cancer. It stands to reason, then, that the more cell
divisions an animal has during its lifetime, the more likely it is for mutagenic
events to occur in somatic cells. In fact, microsatellite alterations and genomic
deep-sequencing analysis of somatic cells have been used to trace cell fates in
mice, providing direct experimental evidence for the accumulation of mutations
with cell division [2-5]. Hence, from this viewpoint, the larger an animal is, the
more likely it should be to develop cancer during its lifetime. This supposition is,
however, not support by empirical observations, which suggest that smaller ani-
mals have a relatively higher rate of cancer compared with larger animals,
or conversely larger animals have a lower than relative expected rate of cancer
development. In fact, quantitative analysis supports this contention [6]. This
non-concordance is known as Peto’s paradox [6-9].
