The: endoderm consists of rather large celis with very deli-
Scate walls; it, constitutes a, thick lining of the, tube, and nearly fills up the entire

Zeapable of occasional obliteration.., 'The cells of the tentacular endoderm are glan-

Zistic of the, general endodermic secretion. The appearance; of transyerse septa is
Zprobably due to the occurrence at regular interyals, of interruptions in the continuity
Sof the endodermic layer. E Though the tentacula of Zydra present no appearance of the transyerse septa, their
Sstructure is nevertheless essentially the same as; that of the tentacula of Cordylophora,
the only difference being in the fact that the endoderm forms a thinner stratum in
Sllydra, and thus encroaches less. on the cavity of the tube, and does not present the
