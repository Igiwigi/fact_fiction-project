movement, and the anode the pole by which rest, inhibition, and “assimilation” are
evoked, in contrast with the kathode evoking action, excitation, and “ dissimilation” ;
or whether, e.g., the conversion of a positive into a negative variation under the
influence of carbon dioxide or of prolonged tetanisation be due to altered time-
relations of anelectrotonic and katelectrotonic effects—the facts will remain, and
doubtless contribute to the future elucidation of this obscure corner in electro-
physiology. I think it quite possible that facts which can be most obviously exposed
in terms of Hertne’s theory of antagonism, may be more accurately described in terms
of Hermany’s theory of electrotonus, yet that in the end the two sets of terms may
be found to denote the same opposed chemico-physical changes in living matter. Meanwhile it is desirable that I should, as briefly as possible, describe the experi-
ments I have so far been able to make in this direction, and the theoretical interpre-
tation of which they appear to be susceptible. To this end it will be convenient to give (1) a more connected account of experiments
already touched upon in Chapter III., concerning the effects of tetanisation ; (2) a
preliminary account of experiments concerning the action of carbon dioxide on polari-
sation phenomena; and (3) what seem to be the principal hypothetical inferences
based upon these various data.
