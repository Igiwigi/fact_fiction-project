Dendrerpeton may be characterised as having a lizard-like form of body, with
the anterior and posterior extremities nearly equal ; the skull somewhat elongate with
8mall orbits, and the nostrils placed at the front. The cranial bones sculptured. The
teeth plicated at the base, more especially on their inner sides. A. series of large
teeth on the palate. The body was covered above with imbricated horny scales and
had lappets or pendants ab the 8ides. The abdomen was protected by thin bony
scales semi-elliptical or oat-shaped in form, and arranged in a chevron pattern. There
2 was probably also a thoracic plate. Two species, D. Acadianum and D. Oweni.

I Of the above species six were more or less perfectly known previous to the recent
explorations, but additional material has been obtained illustrating some of their
characters. In the following notes these new facts will be stated, with more full

= dexcriptions of the new species.

This species is by much the most abundant in the erect trees examined. Tt is the
E type of the genus ylonomus and of the family Microsauria. Its characters may
S now be given somewhat completely, as follows —
