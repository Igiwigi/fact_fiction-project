the grids, enumerating the crops, and making necessary field entries; this was called
‘enumeration time’. Besides this a certain amount of time was required for miscellaneous
work.

338 P. C. MAHALANOBIS ON LARGE-SCALE SAMPLE SURVEYS

32. It was found that in a large-scale survey the journey time was much greater than
enumeration time; in the jute survey of 1941 it was in fact three times larger. It was also
found that the journey time depended upon the number of grids per square mile (i.e. on
their distance apart) but was independent of the size (or area) of the individual grids,
Enumeration time, on the other hand, naturally increased with the size of grids, but was
independent of their density. Time required for miscellaneous work was more or less con-
stant and independent of both size and density of grids. A similar analysis was also made
of the time required for the statistical portion of the work. Further details are given in
Part III. Numerical values of the parameters naturally fluctuated to some extent from
year to year, but the results were reasonably steady, and in general agreement with
what one would expect from broad considerations. The experimental work thus fully
confirmed the need as well as the possibility of studying the cost function on empirical
lines.
