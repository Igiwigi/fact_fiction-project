The denominator for m = 6 shows the sudden large rise after a slow change which
Zn also exhibits, but it cannot be explained, as in that case, by treating it as a
collateral due to a modification of D() alone. The closest collateral of this type
would be due to 6, and this changes D() by 5°66 producing in the denominator
a change too far in the opposite direction. In fact it becomes 6°912000, 3471 below
