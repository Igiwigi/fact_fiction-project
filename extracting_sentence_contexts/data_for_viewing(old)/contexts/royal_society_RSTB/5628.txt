distally directed spines.

The gill lamelle recline obliquely at the sides so that their ventral surfaces touch
the substratum. Each gill lamella is somewhat thickened along the inferior margin.
By the application of this additional callous surface to the substratum the area of
adhesion is increased. These callosities are better marked on the median lamelle,
which are longer and broader than the others.

The nymphs of Heptagenia are similar to those of Hedyonurus, and in certain cases
the resemblance is so close that they can be hardly distinguished. Inthe former the
lamelle are narrowly lanceolate and do not help to support the animal on the sub-
stratum. So far as the form of the body and the legs is concerned, Heptagenia shows an
advance on the Eedyonurus type, as also in the fact that the spines on the posterior
border of the segments on the dorsal surface are still further reduced. -The nymphs of
Heptagenia have failed to utilise their gill lamella for the purpose of adhesion, and thus
the advantage gained in the flattening of the body and the legs is counterbalanced.
The Eedyonurus and the Heptagenia nymphs have been modelled along slightly different
lines to withstand an equally swift current. Heptagenia appears to have reached the
climax of modification along its line, while the gill lamellae of Hedyonurus, by further
modifications, have been instrumental in the production of the highly modified genera
of Heptageniide. It will be shown presently that the function of attachment is being
gradually shifted from the legs to the gill lamelle. Such a change of function is a
common phenomenon among living organisms.

I have collected large numbers of the nymphs of the genus Epeorus in different parts
