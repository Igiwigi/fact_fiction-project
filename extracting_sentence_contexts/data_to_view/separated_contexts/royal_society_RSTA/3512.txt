(iv) Planning under perfect (deterministic) information

Note that we can also minimize each scenario’s total cost as shown in equation (3.21). Here, the
planner assumes perfect information of the future and thus the associated (deterministic) solution
may represent an investment option that cannot be efficiently adapted if a different scenario
(which was, in fact, ignored) is realized. This case can also be considered as a base, reference

(i) Input data

We study the electricity network depicted in figure 2 with three nodes (N1, N2 and N3),
three existing conventional generators (G1, G2 and G3), three existing lines (L12, L13 and L23)
and one load (D). In order to face the forecasted demand growth along a planning horizon
comprising three epochs spanning five years each, the system can be expanded through wind
power generation (W), solar power generation (S), a line (L’23), a FACTS device, namely a quad-
booster phase-shifting transformer (QB) [73], and a battery storage system (B).
