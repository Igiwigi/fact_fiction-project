We run PDHG for 2000 iterations = epochs and SPDHG for 1000 iterations = 50 epochs. We observe that even after five epochs, a meaningful reconstruction is obtained using the
SPDHG algorithm, whereas in PDHG no structures of the rock are observed. In fact, the SPDHG
reconstruction after five epochs is visually closer to the PDHG reconstruction after 50 epochs. This
