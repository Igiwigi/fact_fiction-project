panying vigorous growth in the presence of carbohydrates, especially cane-sugar.
This sheath is very evident in fresh cultures from soil, the prominent drop-like
colonies being composed of capsuled rods and filaments imbedded in a mass of jelly
and forming a beautiful zoogloea (Plate 15, fig. 13). On potato the gelatinous sheath
is also very evident, and gives to the growth its peculiarly viscous character, whereas
on peptone-gelatine, and on other solid media devoid of carbohydrates, the sheath is
much reduced or entirely wanting, and the growth is neither gelatinous nor viscous.
Moreover the gelatinous sheath is a very evanescent character. It gradually dis-
appears with repeated cultures even on saccharose-gelatine, so that, after two or three
transfers, the colonies assume the form and size seen on peptone-gelatine ; the same
thing occurs in a primary culture (that is, one directly from the soil) if allowed to
remain undisturbed for two or three weeks or until the gelatine beneath the colony is
liquefied thoroughly ; and finally, as might be inferred from the latter fact, dilution
of the gelatine quickly brings about the solution and disappearance of the sheath.

This process may be observed very readily in hanging-drop cultures in 10 per cent.

the gelatine by the growth of the organism is accentuated by the condensation of
water on the cover-glass, and in such cases I have often seen a small zooglcea in the
denser portion of the drop burst, as it were, and its component rods and chains
stream out into the dilute portion of the drop, where they continue their growth
