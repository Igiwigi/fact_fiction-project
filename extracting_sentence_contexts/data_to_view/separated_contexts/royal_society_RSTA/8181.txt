From the above account it will be clear that the microseisms of the monsoon type
begin to make their first appearance long before the actual burst of the monsoon in
Malabar, and that their development follows closely its progress and its subsequent

history. If there is a strong monsoon over the sea areas the microseisms are strongly
marked, and when the monsoon weakens, the microseisms, too, become weak. Tt is, in fact, the roughness of the sea caused by the monsoon current that determines
the intensity of the monsoon microseisms. ‘To make this point clear, the amplitudes of
the microseisms during the monsoon months of 1924 and 1925, and also the estimated
state of the neighbouring seas, have been plotted in fig. 3. For the purpose of making
