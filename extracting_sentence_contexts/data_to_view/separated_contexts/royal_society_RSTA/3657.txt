It is interesting to note that the scaling of the wavenumber with 1, ie. m~1Â°/*, has already
been suggested in two previous works [17,18]. Vella et al. [17] used a scaling argument along

12


the lines of [15] to explain the wrinkle number observed at onset (the NT behaviour). Such an
argument should only be used to determine the FT behaviour, however; the apparently good
agreement between the two is, we believe, an accident of the fact that the wrinkle number
at onset only reaches the expected 17/9 scaling when t S> 1 while, for the values investigated
previously [17], the NT behaviour was still transitioning between the t <1 and 1 > 1 regimes. A later consideration of the global energy consistent with the FT approach was given by Vella
et al. [18]. This result predicted some variation in wrinkle wavenumber with indentation depth
(though did not observe such variation), but did not take into account the spatial variation of
the wrinkle pattern.
