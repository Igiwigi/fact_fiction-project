parenchyma within (see figs. 1, 2 and 9). Elements with black contents,
recalling the “secretory sacs” of Lyyinodendron, can sometimes be detected in the
cupular tissue, but their characters are not definite enough to help materially in
identification. The most interesting point about the ground-tissue of the cupule is
the fact that it was infested with fungi. Fungus-spores are almost always to be
detected ; in some specimens (e.g., U. C. L., R. 15) the tissues are completely filled
with them, and they occur in such masses that they might be taken for a part of the
normal structure, if it were not for comparison with other specimens in which the
sume bodies occur isolated. Fungal hyphe are also found, sometimes forming dense
strands following the course of the vascular bundles. All indications point to the
cupule having already been an effete organ at the stage when its preservation took
place, its condition contrasts markedly with that of the well-preserved adjacent
fragments of the vegetative organs of Lyginodendron and other plants. This fact has
an important bearing on the condition of the cupular glands, now to be described.

The glands form the most conspicuous feature of the cupule, by means of which
even small fragments can usually be recognised at once ; they occur on all parts of
the cupule and pedicel (phots. 1, 4 and 15, figs. 1-3, 7 and 11) and are very numerous.
Thus in the transverse section represented in fig. 7 no less than twenty-three are
shown 77 situ.

The glands are massive structures, seated with a broad base on the cupule ;
sometimes they are practically sessile, but usually there is a distinct stalk, varying
much in length (see phots. 1, 4, 16, 21 and 22, figs. 7, 14 and 17). In all cases the
free end of the gland is formed by a large, more or less spherical head. In dimensions
