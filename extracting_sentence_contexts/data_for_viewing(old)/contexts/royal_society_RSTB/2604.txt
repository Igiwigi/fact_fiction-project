of the fascicles bend almost directly towards the surface. On the other hand, in the
inner planes of the septum, the axes of the fascicles are met lengthways for some
distance. They produce here the appearance (already familiar in figures of Galaxea,

&c.) of a more or less continuous line, representing the obliquely-cut axes of successive
fascicles. We have in this fact a proof that the fascicles develop at first in an
obliquely upward and outward direction with reference to the middle line or “ ideal
axis” of an individual trabecula (cf. antea, fig, 25, p. 143).

A tangential section (18 times enlarged) is drawn in fig. 41, including three septa
and two interseptal loculi, occupied in part by synapticule. Passing into the synap-
ticulz are fascicles which have their origin in the septum, at a plane near the septal
surface. Those fascicles may either not grow sufficiently beyond the surface, or may
