T have not 8ucceeded yet
in finding out whether these pigments are dissolved in the plasma bathing the tissues,
or in the s0lid parts of the tissues. In the case of muscle, certainly a small amount of
myohzematin was obtained from the plasma, but after squeezing out all juice, the
muscular fibre showed abundance of myohzmatin, which at the same time may have
been prevented exuding by coagulation of the myosin, I am inclined to believe that a
certain amount of myohematin belongs to the s0/1d (or semi-solid) part of the muscular
fibre, and probably the same remark applies to muscle hazmoglobin ; for after all the
opposite conelusion is mainly based on Kine and EBrrrn's observation of the
presence of a living nematode within the sarcolemma, and this does not altogether
exclude the possibility of the presence of a colouring matter in the sarcous substance. T have not insisted 8trongly on the fact that myohamatin is a histohamatin, as
anyone cannot fail to come to that conelusion who studies the accompanying charts. Myohzmatin then may be considered as the true intrinsic colouring matter of muscle,
and the histohzmatins the intrinsic colouring matters of the tissues and organs ; both
may be reinforced or replaced at times by hemoglobin when extra activity of internal
respiration is required ; probably the same radical may be made use of for building up
all these pigments, at all events they seem to be related, since the same decomposition
product—hematoporphyrin—is probably yielded by all of them. The fact that in the
lower animals pigments of less complex molecular structure than haemoglobin and
identical with its decomposition products can function like it, forces itself on anyone's
attention who studies the pigments of the Invertebrata.
