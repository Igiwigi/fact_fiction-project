called the critic surface, intersecting the nodal curve in the points P=0, Q=0,
AC—B*=0, which are the pinch-points thereof; or if there be a cuspidal curve, then
such of these points as are not, situate on the cuspidal curve are the pinch-points: see my
paper © On a Singularity of Surfaces,” Quart. Math. Journ. vol. ix. (1868) pp. 332-338.
The single tangent plane at the pinch-point meets the surface (se p. 338) in a curve
having at the pinch-point a triple point, =cusp+2 nodes, viz. there is a cuspidal branch
the tangent to which coincides with that of the nodal curye; and there is a simple
branch the tangent to which may be called the cotangent at the pinch-point. In the
particular case where the nodal curye is a right line the section is the line twice (repre-
senting the cuspidal branch), and a residual curve of the order 2—2, the tangent to
which is the cotangent.

24, The pinch-plane, or reciprocal singularity //=1, is in fact a torsal plane touching
the surface along a line, or meeting it in the line twice and in a residual curve. Let
the line and curve meet in a point P; for the reason that the section by the plane is
the line twice and the residual curve, the section has at P two coincident nodes; that is,
the plane is a node-couple plane with two coincident nodes. The plane meets the con-
secutive node-couple plane in a line p passing through P and touching at this point the
residual curye. Considering now the reciprocal figure, the reciprocal of the pinch-plane
is thus a point of the nodal curye, and is a pinch-point; the tangent plane at the pinch-

point is the reciprocal of the point P; the tangent to the nodal curve is the reciprocal
of the line p, that is, of the tangent at P to the residual curve; and the cotangent at the
pinch-point is the reciprocal of the torsal line.
