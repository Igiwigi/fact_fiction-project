and so for the columns associated with each group of equal roots. These and other
conditions which arise in the course of the investigation will be called “ equations of
condition.” Supposing those already found to be satisfied, we may return to the
solution of the equations X, and of these the following statements are to be
proved :—

I. The first ¢—1 equations of the (r+1)™ set determine 2,’...7,° in terms of
x,'...a',-, and 6',4;...0',-,41; the equations from the (¢,+1)' onwards give w,°*1...7,"
in terms of the same quantities.

II. When the values thus found are substituted in the equation X,,,, the resulting
left-hand member is independent of the undetermined quantities x,'...«,', 0,'...0',-» for
all values of 7 up to (€.—2), but for 7 = ¢—1 it is independent of all save @,'; in fact,
the equation X, is an algebraic equation of degree e, for 0,’ and contains no other
undetermined quantity.

ILI. Supposing one root of this to be chosen for the value of 0,', and the equations Y
to be treated in the same way, Y,_, will be an equation of degree (q—1) in @,’,
whose roots wre exactly the remaining roots of X..

IV. Similarly Z,,_, furnishes an equation of degree ¢,—2 for 0,*, whose roots are the
remaining roots of Y,_,, and therefore of X,, and so on.

Thus 0,'...0," are the roots of the equation X,..
