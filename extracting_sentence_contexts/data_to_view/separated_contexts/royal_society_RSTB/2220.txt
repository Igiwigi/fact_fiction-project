In harmon y with the difference of overlap of territories of the palmar nerves dad of
their spinal roots, is the much greater overlapping of the contiguous borders of the
Vth cranial and IInd cervical than of the territories of the individual divisions of the
Vth cranial itself (see above, p. 62), a difference which was made use of in determining

whether those divisions were of segmental quality, or, like other peripheral nerves,
functional rather than morphological entities. It is then clear that in the hand, as in the foot of Macacus, the extent of
overlap of the skin-fields of the peripheral nerve-trunks, even on the exquisitely
sensitive plantar and palmar surfaces, is much less than that of the cutaneous areas
of the nerve-roots ; it is, in fact, not so great as may be the overlap of the fields of
nerye-roots three segments distant one from another. If fig. 7, p. 102, be compared as
