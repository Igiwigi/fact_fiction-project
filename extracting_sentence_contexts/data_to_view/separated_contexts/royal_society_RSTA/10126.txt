Again,
it is unnecessary to suppose that Botxey’s lead,t prepared by electrolysis, and similar
in composition to sheet-lead, is allotropic because it oxidises rapidly in air while sheet-
lead does not: for the electrolysis gives the essential fine division, and the consequent
large amount of surface exposed to the air greatly accelerates oxidation. Lastly, ScuiirzeNBERGER{ supposed that the copper deposited on the platinum
electrode of a copper-platinum cell was allotropic because it was very fragile, its
density was only about ‘9 of that of normal copper, it oxidised rapidly in air, and it
could be converted into normal copper by prolonged contact with dilute sulphuric acid. Here, too, the supposition of allotropy is not required to account for the facts. For
the low density, the fragility and the rapid oxidation are all accounted for by the
loose structure which we should expect in such a deposit of copper, while Carry Lra
found that his silvers, which, if our conclusion at p. 285 is correct, were only finely
divided silver, could be transformed to normal silver by contact with sulphuric acid. Similar remarks apply to Scut1zeNBeRGER’s silver.{

Consider now MarrHressEn’s important generalisation,§ that metals may sustain
change in their molecular condition by union with each other in a fused state.
