Nor does the formation of leaf primordia depend directly on the presence of older primordia
or leaves; but the possibility that the latter may exercise an indirect effect, or an effect on
the subsequent development of primordia, is not excluded.

(c) Stelar morphology

It has been shown (Wardlaw 1947a) that when an apical meristem, isolated by vertical
incisions, grows on, it forms a short vasculated shoot. The vascular system is at first soleno-
stelic, but as new leaves are formed it becomes dictyostelic. Thus, by the experimental
procedure adopted, the large dictyostelic shoot of Dryopteris can be reduced at will to
a small solenostele. A protostelic shoot has now been obtained by making incisions very
close to the apical cell. The small shoot later became attenuated, the apical meristem
became parenchymatous, and the vascular system faded out. Facts of this kind, as also
abundant data relating to the vascular tissue in isolated apical meristems and induced
buds, support the writerâ€™s. hypothesis that the initial differentiation of the vascular system
is due to the downward movement of a substance or substances from an actively growing
apical meristem (Wardlaw 1944a). To what extent the apical cell in particular is responsible
for this process is a matter for further investigation.

The only vascular tissue present in an isolated terminal region lies immediately below
the active apical meristem, or in the new shoot which results from its growth. In the large
number of specimens which have now been examined, there has been no evidence what-
soever of new accessory vascular strands making connexion with the vascular system in
