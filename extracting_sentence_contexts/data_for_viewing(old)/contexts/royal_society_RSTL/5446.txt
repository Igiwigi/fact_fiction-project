If we equate the right-hand members of (e+2;) of the above equations: to-zero;
and then eliminate dialytically the several -powers of -@ from 2"***** to a'* (both
inclusive), the result of this process will evidently be: of (e+:) dimensions in respect
of the coefficients in V, and of : dimensions in respect of the coefficients in U; and of
the degree a” in it will also be of the form
