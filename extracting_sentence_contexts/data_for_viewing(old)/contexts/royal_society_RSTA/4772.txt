Keywords: as- yet unpublished paper [2]. We give here an account
quantum mechanics, Zariski geometries, of the current status of this work and trace some ideas
Weyl algebras, algebraic Hilbert spaces, for future developments. In particular, in this paper,

we focus on the formalism of quantum mechanics and
describe how to construct a geometric semantics for it
by means of using model-theoretic tools. In fact, this

commutative geometry). Here ‘geometric’ should also be
understood in some broad but well-defined sense.

We can think of model theory as the mainstream
