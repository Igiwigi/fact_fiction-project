Although the specific band assignments are necessarily rather tentative in what must be : 8
viewed as a complex specimen, it is nevertheless reasonable to propose that the Raman 8
spectroscopic data support the assertion that the specimen is in fact human brain, although this : Ss
has been degraded somewhat in the burial environment. The surprising outcome of this study is : S

that the brain has survived at all over some 160 years; there is now a growing body of support
in the literature from archaeological excavations for the survival of brain tissue with associated
skeletal remains, particularly in wet, anoxic environments such as that noted here. In the case of
the Iron Age brain from Heslington, the presence of cyanobacterial biosignatures were evident
in the Raman spectrum both of the brain itself and in the black sludge occupying the cavity
between the brain and the cranium [30]. It was concluded that possibly the cyanobacteria had
been a contributing factor in the preservation of the brain tissue over many centuries. Here, in
contrast, there is no evidence at all for the presence of cyanobacteria in the Raman spectra of the
brain specimen. It could be construed that a different survival mechanism may be responsible,
despite the common features between the two studies, such as their physical appearance and the
