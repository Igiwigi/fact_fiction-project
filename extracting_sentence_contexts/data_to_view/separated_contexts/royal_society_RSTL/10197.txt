Before describing bhese sections, I may remark that the nasal passage carries the
upper lip far in front of the lower ; but the lower lip, even in the Ammocate, is far
back ; whereas, in the adult Lamprey, the lower lip, when the sucking disc ts in action,
projects beyond the © anterior dorsal cartilage,” and its enclosing skin, the upper lip. The end of the external nasal passage is protected by nasal barbels, and the mouth
opens further back ; there are two pairs of oral barbels, the outer unciform and
the inner mammillate. There are three nasal barbels on one side and four on the
other ; 8iaz thin sections of this part, one of which was drawn, show this ; and,
corroborative of this fact, Dr. GUNTHER, in his © Study of Fishes ” (p. 695, fig. 320, A)
