The particles of matter expelled from the vessel are of two
kinds: one consists of larger particles of slag produced by the violent agitation of
the fluid charge inside the converter; these quickly fall to the ground. The other
kind is the fume proper, composed of the products of combustion of the metallic
vapours. The particles forming this fume are undoubtedly very small; this is
proved by the fact that they scatter the light falling on them, and cast* a brown
shadow, and also by the great height to which the cloud ascends. These very small
particles will be kept at the temperature of the escaping gases. The spectrum during the “over-blow” is very feeble in the violet and does not
extend beyond 4000, The spectrum of the lime-light extends into the ultra-violet, so
also does the light emitted mainly from the furnace walls, through the working doors
of a Siemens-Martin steel-melting furnace.
