But as the number of seeds fully developed would depend on
the extent to which the flower had been fertilised, it seemed to me, after further
thinking about the problem, that unless I counted all the abortive as well as the fully
developed seeds, I should find the factor of homotyposis weakened by the external
chances upon which | thought cross-fertilisation must depend, and which I feared would
have nothing in the main to do with the individuality of the plant. I made some
attempts to count all abortive as well as fully developed seeds in certain species, but I
found the task not only very laborious, but my estimates doubtful. Examining for
another purpose Darwin’s ‘ Cross- and Self-Fertilisation of Plants.’ I was struck by
the fact that he did not hesitate for the purpose of comparing their vigour to count
the seeds of plants living in the open and all alike subject to free visitation from
insects and bees. He distinctly states (3rd Edn., p. 115) that “ the difference in the
number of the contained seeds* must depend upon the constitution of the plants.”
This view of the matter impressed me without entirely removing my earlier doubts. Given a number of plants living under the like conditions, and with a superabundant
visitation from insects, there would be ample and equal chance of fertilisation for all

* Darwin in all cases appears to have calculated the good or fully developed seed.
