incredible speeds is needed for Relativistic mechanics.

The relationship between BOLD and the firing rate of cells
within a region does not appear to be a matter of simple
aggregation as it is with particle speeds and temperature. If it
were, then BOLD could be used as a thermometer for neural
activity without further consideration. Although there is a
relationship between BOLD and neural activity [58-60] that
has enabled advances in cognitive neuroscience, the interpret-
ation of BOLD response is not always straightforward [61].
For example, BOLD response is affected by the local vascular
anatomy [62,63], differs according to age [64], and certain
regions are susceptible to imaging artefacts. The fact that
BOLD does not simply reflect aggregate neural activity
(either synaptic or spiking) complicates its usage.

On the positive side, BOLDâ€™s divergence from simple aggre-
gation presents some opportunities. Perhaps rather than just
reflecting grey matter activity, BOLD may also reflect white
matter [65-67] and astrocyte [68-71] activity as well. If so,
BOLD response may track some general notion of energy con-
sumption that could be useful for evaluating theories. Because
BOLD is such an important measure for evaluating higher level
neuro-computational accounts, research that can explain what
BOLD is measuring should help clarify exactly what higher
