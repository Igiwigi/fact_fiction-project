Before passing to the consideration of these
+ indications of parallelism between the thermal and optical behaviour of the crystals of
& the three salts, attention must be drawn to the two following salient facts which are
= apparent from an inspection of the linear coefficients. It is that :
ic The amount of expansion along the direction of the crystallographical axis b is
P practically ly identical for all three sulphates, indicating that the interchange of the
Shthree metals is without influence on the thermal behaviour along the macrodiagonal
2 axis of the crystals. Moreover, the crystals of all three salts expand least along this
5 direction, which is therefore that of the minimum avis of the thermal ellipsoid.
5 These two facts are doubtless of significance with respect to the structure of the
‘8 molecule, apparently indicating absence of the metallic atoms or their spheres of
2 motion from the immediate proximity of the axis 6. The significance becomes
