Consider the (SA), 84/2 whose vertices have eight co-ordinates, all congruent to 0
or to 4, modulo 8, and adding up to zero. The centre of a typical bounding «,; 84/2 is
11.91 (1, bd, Teh ds = 7)

Tn virtue of the symmetries
(1234567) and Tyo, STiss, ‘and Tys5, R* Ti557,
this point gives rise to the totality of points whose eight co-ordinates, adding up to zero,
have, as residues modulo 8, either eight 1’s, 3’s, 5’s, 7’s, four 1’s and four 5’s, or four
3’s and four 7’s. Since these points possess the additional symmetry 'I’* which reflects
in the point 11.91, they must be the vertices of 1g, < (in fact, of 13, 44/2).
Hence the group of symmetries of
