apa errs former kind of stress than for the latter, the ratio being

is much greater for the

about 2'85 : 1. R : The 8mall alterations of resistance which can be produced by fluid pressure as shown

in this table prove also how impossible it would have been to detect with 8uch changes
of pressure as can be effected by an air-pump any alteration of resistance due directly
to compress10n, and therefore the value of the mode of experimenting already alluded
to in determining the amount of lowering of the temperature of the freezing-point of
water by pregsure : in fact, the change of resistance due to the lowering of the tem-
perature of the melting-point of ice by the pressure would be more than 22 times the
change of resistance due to the pressure only. A brief consideration also suffices to show that the alteration of resistance due to
any change of temperature is in all cases very much greater than that which would
follow from the same change of volume produced by mechanical stress ; this will be
seen at once from a glance ab the next table. Taprme VII.
