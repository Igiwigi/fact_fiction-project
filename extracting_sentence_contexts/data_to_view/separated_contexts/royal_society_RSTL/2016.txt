The powers which ought to respond to our remedies have failed. Our
efforts therefore are for the most part equally unavailing in restoring either the
sensibility or the powers of circulation, and both are necessary to recovery. From a review of the whole of the facts which have been laid before the
Society, it appears,â€”

That in the brain and spinal marrow alone reside the active parts of the
neryous system. That the law of excitement in the parts of these organs, which are associated
with the nerves of sensation and voluntary motion, is uniform excitement fol-
lowed by proportional exhaustion, which, when it takes place to such a degree
as to suspend their usual functions, constitutes sleep ; all degrees of exhaustion
which do not extend beyond them and the parts associated with them, being
consistent with health. That the law of excitement in those parts of the brain and spinal marrow
which are associated with the vital neryes is also uniform excitement, but
which is only, when excessive, followed by any degree of exhaustion, no degree
of which is consistent with health.
