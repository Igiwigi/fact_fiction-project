access to numbers: the philosophical How can we acquire a grasp of cardinal numbers, even the first very small
positive cardinal numbers, given that they are abstract mathematical entities?
That problem of cognitive access is the main focus of this paper. All the major
rival views about the nature and existence of cardinal numbers face difficulties;
