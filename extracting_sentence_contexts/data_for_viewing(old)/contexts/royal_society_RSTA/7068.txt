tatively, the effect of the boundary layer on the aerodynamic force coefficients of a projectile,
a study which emphasized the great dearth of information and led to the development of
certain approximate methods; and secondly from an attempt to calculate the position of
separation of the boundary layer. The photographs of figure 1, plate 1, are included as
a matter of interest to show the kind of conditions under which separation occurs in external
ballistics. The values of # involved range from about } million in a small supersonic wind
tunnel up to 100 million or more for a large shell, and it seems likely that in covering this
range laminar and turbulent boundary layers are involved, but there are reasons for thinking
that in applications to supersonic wind tunnels the boundary layer of the model is more
likely to be laminar over most of the range. Therefore while both cases are likely to be,
ultimately, of practical importance, the obvious course is to concentrate first on the laminar
layer which seems to be of immediate value in model work. An additional reason is provided
by the fact that the laminar layer is much more tractable analytically.

2. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS

It is well known that, although, strictly speaking, the influence of viscosity extends over
the whole field influenced by the body, solutions of the boundary-layer equations possess
the property of approximating closely to their asymptotic values a short distance from it,
and that thereafter, for all practical purposes, the influence of viscosity can be neglected.
It is therefore convenient to regard the boundary layer as increasing the thickness of the
