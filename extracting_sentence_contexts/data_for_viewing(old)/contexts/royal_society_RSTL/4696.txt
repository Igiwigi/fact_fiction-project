If, therefore, taking the maximum value of- in any revolution, we find that f ex-
1

ceeds it, it is certain that the wheel cannot have slipped in that revolution ; whilst if,
on the other hand, F falls short of it, it must have slipped*. The positions between
which the slipping will take place continually, are determined by solving, in respect
to cos 0,, the equation

ee dens 2 OY. Cn

The application of these principles to the slip of the carriage-wheel is rendered less
difficult by the fact, that the value of Ã¾ is always in that case 80 small, as compared
with the values of k and a, that 2 may be neglected in formulz (34.) and (35.), as com-

pared with unity. Those equations then become

* Of course, the elipping, in the case of the driving-wheels of a locomotive, is diminished by the fact that
whilst one wheel is not biting upon the rail the other is.
