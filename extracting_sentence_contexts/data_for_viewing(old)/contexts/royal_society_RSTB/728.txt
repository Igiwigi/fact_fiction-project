AND THE ORGANISMS COMPOSING IT. 151

Mingled with the objects referred to are large numbers of minute spheroidal specks,
and rods of various lengths, and perhaps (but not always) some longer filaments—in
fact, cocci, bacteria, bacilli, and leptothrix-forms, &c., to use the current phraseology.
These are unquestionably naked * Schizomycetes (Plate 13, figs. 3 and 8) from their
form, reactions, the stages of division which they present, and from their behaviour in
cultivations.

Tt is now easy to see how natural were the questions—Have these naked forms
anything in common with the sheathed cocci, rodlets, filaments, &c., above referred
to? Are they, in fact, merely the Schizomycetes escaped from their investing
sheaths; and are the homogeneous structures, first described, merely the empty
sheaths ?

As a matter of fact this is the case ; but it will readily be understood that such a
conclusion could not be taken for granted, and several other questions had to be
propounded and answered before these facts were demonstrated, and the first and
most obvious of such questions was, are all these variously-shaped naked bacteria
different species, or not? It should also be said that it was a long time before the
question of their identity assumed a definite form.

At the commencement of the investigation I assumed that they probably were
distinct, partly on more general grounds, and partly because at an early stage I
