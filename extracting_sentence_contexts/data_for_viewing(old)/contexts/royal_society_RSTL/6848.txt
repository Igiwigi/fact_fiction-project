way between the respective nuclei (5). The fibre grows at the points marked a, and at
these points only. The oldest parts of the fibre are the narrowest portions, marked 6.
These are narrow because at the time of their formation the masses of germinal matter
were 80 much smaller than they are now (fig. 30). The nuclei in connexion with these
fibres may divide, and other new fibres may be produced; and a similar process occurs
in the nuclei of the ganglion-cell which are connected with the formation of the spiral
fibres.

Fig. 29 gives the appearance which this fibre would have presented if examined at
an earlier period. Now, although this figure literally represents but my own view of
the matter, it is only just that I should state that fibres presenting every degree of
change have been actually observed in the same specimen, s0 that there can be little
doubt as to the general truth of the facts brought forward, although differences of

opinion may be entertained with reference to some of the explanations I have ventured
to offer.

My observations upon various tissues in different stages of development have convinced
me that the growth of the cells or elementary parts is a ninch more simple process than
is generally supposed, and consists merely in a certain proportion of germinal matter
undergoing conyersion into formed material, while at the same time pabulum pPasses into
the germinal matter, and the wonderful properties or powers possessed by this substance
