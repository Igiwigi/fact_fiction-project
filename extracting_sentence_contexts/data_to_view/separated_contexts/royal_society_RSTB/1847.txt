When the tooth becomes a little older,
and the basis thickens, the processes appear glued together by an intercellular matrix as it were, so
that the whole basis appears as one mass, the constituent parts of which are separated with difficulty,
and only by prolonged maceration in ammonium bichromate. But by this time, the deposition of
calcareous salts begins, and soon after, the differentiation of the mineralised portion into dentine and
enamel. The fact that the processes of the odontoblasts extend right up to the basement membrane,
occupying the place of the future enamel, admits of only one view with regard to the origin of the
enamel, and explains the existence of tubules which have often been described as extending into it, and
continuous with the dentinal tubules.”

From these and other data she concludes that ‘“ The enamel, like the dentine, owes its origin to the
odontoblasts, the presence of which, at an early stage, may be traced quite up to the outer edge,” this
generalisation being applied by her to the development of all enamel and not only to the tissue so
named in Plagiostomes and Ganoids. She also writes : ‘‘ The whole tooth is formed under the basement membrane, and the entire growth is
from the side of the pulp. The calcification begins at the surface of the tooth, and there is no addition
made outside the part already calcified, no newly-formed layer of enamel appearing as a membrane on
the surface, the tooth receiving additions from the side of the pulp only.”

From the foregoing extracts it will be seen that Miss Nuny discovered the existence of the specialised
layer upon the surface of the dentine papilla of Plagiostomes, and quite correctly ascribed to it the
réle of being the matrix in which their enamel was formed.
