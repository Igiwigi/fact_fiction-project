Wricut, 1871, p. 150; pl. 30, figs. 1-2 (Peltastes). Material.â€”A fully-grown specimen, of this common species from Faringdon (EK. 55)
reveals the surprising fact that the girdle of Hyposalenia is quite continuous. The
girdle of recent members of the Saleniide is definitely discontinuous ; perhaps this is
another example of degeneracy comparable with that just indicated for the Arbaciide. The evidence of EH. 55 has been confirmed in very many specimens of varying size, and
even in the smallest the continuity of the girdle was found to be complete.
