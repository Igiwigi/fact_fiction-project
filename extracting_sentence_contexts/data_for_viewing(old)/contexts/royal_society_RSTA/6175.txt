inflation

Figure 1. Space-time sketch of inflationary cosmology. The vertical axis is time, the horizontal axis corresponds to physical Dw
distance. The inflationary phase of accelerated expansion lasts from time ¢; until time tz. During this time interval and in the 28
case of exponential expansion, the Hubble radius (the solid blue curve) is constant while the physical wavelength of a fixed [eS
comoving fluctuation mode (solid red curve marked by k) grows exponentially. Hence, modes can exit the Hubble radius. After

inflation the Universe evolves according to Big Bang cosmology, the Hubble radius grows linearly in time, and scales re-enter

the Hubble radius. (Online version in colour.)

gravitational waves [12,13] is then almost scale-invariant. The small red tilt of the spectrum stems
from the fact that H(t) decreases slowly in time.

The inflationary scenario is based on the assumption that there was a period in the early
Universe during which space expands (almost) exponentially. In general, cosmological inflation is
studied at the level of an EFT based on general relativity and scalar field matter. In this framework,
inflation is know to be past-incomplete [17], suffering from an initial singularity problem. This is
the first indication of the breakdown of the EFT description of early Universe cosmology. As we
will see below, the EFT description of inflation suffers from other conceptual challenges, and this
motivates the search for alternative early Universe scenarios.

There are alternative early Universe scenarios which satisfy the above-mentioned criteria (see
e.g. [7] for a more detailed discussion). Bouncing Universe models can provide one such scenario.
Here, time runs from —oo to +00. The Universe is initially in a contracting state. New physics
