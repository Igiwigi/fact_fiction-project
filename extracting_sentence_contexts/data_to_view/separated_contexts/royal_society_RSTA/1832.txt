The general features of the agreement were the same for all types. We may
therefore fairly assert that the probable error of any determination of 3 is some-
thing less than 0-2 degrees. The use of the measurement OA’ is of special
importance for small values of 3, and in fact alone makes their accurate determination
possible. The probable error in the determination of ¢ is not quite so easy to estimate, as there
is no alternative method of determining ¢. The method is clearly theoretically sound,
and the errors can only arise from faulty’ estimations of the symmetry of the hole. By making a number of independent determinations for the same hole, with proper
precautions against a biassed judgment, and comparing their consistency, it appeared
that the probable error of any determination of ¢ was less than 24 degrees, unless
the yaw was small (less than 0-8 degrees, say).
