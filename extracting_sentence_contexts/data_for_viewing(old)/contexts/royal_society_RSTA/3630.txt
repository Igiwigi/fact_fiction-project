Furthermore, whole-brain computational models have already provided novel insights into
structure-to-function relationships in human brain networks. Structural network hubs identified
from DTI data have been suggested to be vital for integration and segregation of information, and
especially those regions belonging to the so-called ‘rich-club’ which show dense interconnectivity
amongst each other [106]. Until recently, this had, however, not been examined in terms of the
brain’s functional temporal dynamics. For example, while the hippocampus is well known to


receive multimodal input and play a critical role in memory formation and global integration,
graph theoretical studies of the structural connectome had surprisingly failed to demonstrate
the topological centrality of this region. Thus, by using a whole-brain computational model
constrained by the empirical SC of the macaque brain and in which information flow was
modelled as a discrete-event queueing network, it was shown that the hippocampus in fact
receives a disproportionately high level of information flow and acts a convergence zone for the
network [107]. Similarly, another whole-brain modelling study recently examined the effects of in
silico lesions to the highest-ranking ‘binding nodes’ identified using the methodology introduced
above on measures of systemic integration and encoding of information capability. It was found
that removal of the binding-nodes had a more profound effect on the aforementioned measures
than removal of the ‘rich-club’ regions whose topological importance is solely defined by the
anatomical connectome [108].
