with any continuation of the luminous matter of the arch, concealed by the cloud.
The first appearance of the aurora at nine o'clock, was that of a dark convex cloud,
cutting off the luminous arch, and concealing a body of light behind, the eye naturally
referring the light to a more distant region, while the sharp line of division threw
the cloud forward. Subsequent appearances, howeyer, did not seem to confirm this

notion, but, on the contrary, induced me to consider, whether the dark cloud might
not be a sbstratum of matter differing in nature and density from the superineum-
bent arch of light. The following are the facts which appear to fayour this supposition.
First ; every great outbreak of coruscations from the luminous arch produced a cor-
responding disturbance in the part of the cloud immediately below. Thus, during
the display at 9® 15”, the arch was gradually losing its regular form on the right,
and at 9 20” I noted it © very irregular, with a large indentation on the eastern
side,” while on the west, where the body of light was undisturbed, the arch remained
perfect. Thus also, immediately after the western half had been in vivid corusca-
tion, the whole of the arch was © dilapidated,” and finally, © entirely broken up.”
Secondly ; neither the straight nor waving pencils appeared to proceed from behind
the cloud, but always from the upper surface of the light. Thirdly ; when the arch
was * dilapidated” (see Sketch IV.), it was not merely its upper surface which
was of irregular form, but masses of it were lying in confusion, separated from each
other by a boundary of light, not appearing in the least as if light behind were shin-
