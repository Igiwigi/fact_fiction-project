Figure 4. Plot shows relationship between limiting fictive temperature of the carbonate—water solution as a function of the : _
carbonate weight fraction. Increasing water content in the carbonate glass results in decreasing glass transition temperatures. iy
Data are fitted by Gordon—Taylor equation [40]. Glass transition temperature of pure water is taken from Hallbrucker et al. [35] im
and Capaccioli & Ngai [36]. Inlet displays residuals using the one-parametric fitting parameter. aS)
