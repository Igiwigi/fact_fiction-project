284 N. J. BERRILL: STUDIES IN TUNICATE DEVELOPMENT.

ment, viz., Molgula occulta (roscovita), M. oculata, M. bleizi, M. solenota, M. simplex ;
while Molgula complanata, M. ampulloides, and M. echinosiphonica (citrina) he described
as possessing tailed larvae.

The only later paper, apart from some that were purely speculative and which brought
forward no additional facts, was that of Damas, 1902. In this he described the develop-
ment of Molgula bleizi from sectioned material and his results may briefly be sum-
marised here.

No observations were made on the type of cleavage, though the statements of Lacazn-
Duruters in this connection were questioned on theoretical grounds. Gastrulation is
apparently typical and the blastopore closes through the posterior growth of its dorsal
lip. The upper layer of the roof thus formed becomes neural plate and the lower
chordal cells (see fig. 18); the neural tube is formed through the invagination of the
plate ; thatis, all the observations so far made by Damas are in harmony with ConKLINâ€™s
later account of the development in Styela partita. Damas states further that there
is precocious differentiation of mesoderm on either side of the notochord cells and that
the number of elements is very restricted, but it is doubtful whether the differentiation
