592 MR. C. SPENCE BATE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DECAPOD CRUSTACEA.

But in the larva of the Brachyura that we are now describing, the carapax 18 86en
pass distinctly round the base of the eye and the peduncle to be continued beneath
. carapax, as in fig. B', Plate XI. and fig. 1, B, Plate XLVI., and thus demonstrates
podophthalmic character of the larva even in this early stage. 'Y

'The pair of appendages (Plate XL. figs. A and B, 2) first Succeeding the eyes repre. |
sent the anterior or upper antennze. They respectively consist of a single articulation,
narrowing towards the extremity, where are planted two short simple hairs, and two |
long almost invisible ones of the character that T have elsewhere* termed auditory
cilia, since they are only found to exist upon the antenne which support the acoustic
organs. This fact enables us immediately to identify this immature appendage with
the perfected structure, even at the earliest commencement of the young creature's life;
and also demonstrates that the germ or rudiment of the filament, on which part only
the auditory cilia are ever found, is present. 0

The second pair of appendages (Plate XL. fig. A and B, 3) represent the second or
inferior antennz, each of which in this stage consists of a basal articulation supportinga |
finely serrated spine, which is in fact a process of the same; and a flat, long, and squa- |
miform articulation, ornamented at the extremity with two simple hairs, one longer
than the other. At the base of these two appendages may be distinguished a small
papillaâ€”the germ of the future antenna (3 ).

The next succeeding pair of members are the mandibles (Plate XL. fig. B. 4). These
