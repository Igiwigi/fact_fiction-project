be incomplete. In particular, it was recognized that there are classes of materials
which, if described according to Wilson’s (1931a,b) scheme, should be metallic
conductors but are in fact non-metals.

Review. Transition to metallic conduction 947

Thus, de Boer & Verwey (1937), in one of the earliest studies of the electrical
properties of transition metal oxides, pointed out that nickel oxide, for example, is
a green semiconductor, which according to the Wilson model should be a metallic
conductor owing to the fact that the eight d electrons of the Ni?*+ ion would
only partly fill any 3d electronic band. In the discussions following de Boer &
Verwey’s (1937) paper, Mott & Peierls (1937)? built upon some of those authors’
insightful remarks to suggest that strong Coulomb repulsions between d electrons
on adjacent Ni?+ ions could lead to localization of electrons at individual sites,
rather than delocalization throughout the entire solid, as would be expected with
the Wilson scheme.

Mott (1937) recognized this example as symptomatic of the critical role
that electron-electron interactions or correlations must play in any description
of electrons in solids (and liquids). We now understand that the effects of
electron correlations in certain systems can cause them to be insulating when
they should be metallic according to band theory. In a determined campaign
