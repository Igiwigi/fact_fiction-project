Conclusion image?’), not unlike the perceptual detection and discrimin-
ation decisions that have been studied for decades using
conventional psychophysical procedures with sequences of
discrete trials. There is a large, growing literature on the
neural circuits and computations underlying such perceptual
decisions [97]. We are intrigued by the possibility that judge-
ments about perceptual awareness (‘Do I see something, and
if so, was it this image or that image?’) may, in fact, be embod-
ied in the same neural machinery responsive for other forms of
perceptual decisions. The idea to use binocular rivalry to search for NCsC was never
naive. As Crick and Koch developed the idea, spurred on by
experimental results in monkeys undergoing rivalry [33,34],
they noted that ‘just because a particular neuron follows a per-
cept, it does not automatically imply that its firing is part of the
NCC’ [1].
