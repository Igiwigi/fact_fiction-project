2. If the coefficients are s8uch that the equation remains true when we therein change

the formula is

simultaneously x into NY and y into S then the variables &, y will satisfy the differential

(M a constant, the value of which, as will appear, is given by 4=1+®); and the

problem of transformation is thus to find the coefficients 80 that the equation may
remain true on the aboye simultaneous change of the yalues of a, y. In fact, observing that the original equation and therefore the new equation are each
satisfied on changing therein simultaneously &, y into —&, —y, it follows that the equation
- may be written in the four forms

1-y =(1=2) A(+), 1+y =(1+2) B+),
I-1y=(1-k)0(+), l+y=(1+k)((=+),

the common denominator being, say E, where A, B, C, D, E are all of them rational
and integral functions of & ; and this being so, the differential equation will be satisfied.
