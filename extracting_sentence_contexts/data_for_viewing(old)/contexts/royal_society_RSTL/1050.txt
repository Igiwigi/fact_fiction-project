It is not easy to explain this result, Does the intensity
mark the rapidity of the motion of the electricity ? or, merely
its diminished attraction for the matter on which it acts?
and does this attraction become less in proportion as the cir-
cuit, through which it passes, or in which it is generated, con-
tains a greater number of alternations of bad conductors ?

Mr. Cni.DREN, in his account of the experiments made
with his battery of large plates, has ingeniously referred the
heat produced by the passage of electricity through conduc-
tors, to the resistance it meets. with, and has supposed, what
proves to be the fact, that the heat is in some inverse ratio
to the conducting power, The greatest heat however is pro-

duced in air, where there is reason to suppose the least resis-
tance; and as the presence of heat renders bodies worse con-
ductors, another view may be taken, namely, that the exci-
tation of heat occasions. the imperfection of the conducting
power. But till the causes of heat and of electricity are known,
and of that peculiar constitution of matter which excites the
one, and transmits or propagates the other, our reasoning: on
