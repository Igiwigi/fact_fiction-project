It is not proposed to carry out an exhaustive examination of all the elastic properties
of hair in this paper. That will be reserved for a later communication, when the elastic
properties will be considered in the light of X-ray photographs of hair which has been
subject, while under tension, to the action of steam. It will be shown how the action
of steam on the $-phase brings about a change which prevents its return to the «-phase
and gives rise to the phenomenon known in the textile trade as ‘“‘ permanent set.”
Furthermore—and this is a striking example of the power of X-ray methods even in
such difficult fields as are offered by protein structures—it will be shown how the
maximum true permanent set which may be deduced from the X-ray data, namely,
29 per cent., is in fact very approximately the same as the highest true permanent set
which may be obtained in practice. For the rest, we may say that it is hoped that later
X-ray results will explain the nature of the additional mechanism through the agency
of which it is possible to extend wet hair at least twice as far as dry hair, and hair in
steam at least three times as far as dry hair. At the moment, the only evidence of the
action of cold water on the crystallites is afforded by a photograph of Cotswold wool
stretched in 5 per cent. stages up to 70 per cent., and left to stand between each stage
in a closed vessel over water.
