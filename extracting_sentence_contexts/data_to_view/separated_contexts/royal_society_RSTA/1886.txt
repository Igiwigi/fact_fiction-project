Besides the discovery of the periodic law of the chemical elements, Mendeleev also made other
critical contributions to chemical problems of broad scope. For example, it is perhaps not well
recognized that Mendeleev studied the origins of petroleum and launched the idea of the so-
called ‘abiotic origin’ hypothesis that hydrocarbons originated from iron carbides by the action of
water vapour in the deep interior of the earth. He wrote: ‘The capital fact to note is that petroleum
was born in the depths of the earth, and it is only there that we must seek its origin’ [7]. Remarkably,
Mendeleev’s insights relating to abundant, highly-active iron based catalysts now come to the
fore not only in modern studies of the utilization of CO2 but also in their effective ‘hydrogen
stripping’ from fossil fuels, with the energy carrier hydrogen now advanced as a solution to the
world’s looming climate emergency, as highlighted in the article by Yao et al. [8].

2. The simple or natural elementary bodies (the situation pre-1869)

Dalton, still widely regarded as ‘the immortal author’, recognized chemical combinations as
being formed by the union or addition of elementary atoms, the relative weights of which
he endeavoured to determine, referring those weights to one of the elements—hydrogen—as
unity.
