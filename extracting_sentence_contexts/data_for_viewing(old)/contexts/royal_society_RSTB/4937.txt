in the turning as well as in the cooling experiments, and there is no reason to suppose
that it was markedly different in the two cases.

The only remaining possibility seems to be that the 57 per cent. increase in the
R.M.S. is a real effect of the coolings—a view which receives some support from the
fact that the two independent values of which 57 is the mean (60 per cent. in
KirkPATRICK’s work and 54 per cent. in that of the writer) are in such close
agreement.

It is here that the cooling effect becomes interesting. For, though the data so far
obtained are too fragmentary to warrant detailed conclusions, if further work confirms
what has been done and the mechanism can be traced which connects hatching with
cooling, it may well prove possible to bring the causes of the large fluctuations under
control, and so to improve very considerably the hatching percentages now obtainable.
There are even indications in Table XI of a possible connection between sign of
percentage change and time of hatching in a given incubator which may be significant
in this respect.
