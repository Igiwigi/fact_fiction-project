studied, fuel consumption under the effects of the
plasma is shown to have been enhanced significantly,
particularly for the low-temperature regime (T <

plasma-assisted combustion,
nanosecond-pulsed discharges, flow reactor

studies, low-temperature kinetics 800 K). In fact, multiple transitions in the rates of fuel

consumption are observed depending on fuel with

Richard A. Yetter regime. For all fuels, the temperature for the transition

into the high-temperature chemistry is lowered as a
consequence of the plasma being able to increase the
rate of fuel consumption. Using a phenomenological
interpretation of the intermediate species formed,
it can be shown that the active particles produced
from the plasma enhance alkyl radical formation at
all temperatures and enable low-temperature chain
