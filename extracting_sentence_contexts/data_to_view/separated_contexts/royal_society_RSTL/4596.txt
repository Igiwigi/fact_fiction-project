of the Lake District. The increase in the per-centage in the winter months of 1850 is
doubtless attributable to the fact of the deposition being almost entirely in the form

1 of rain, the fall of snow on the mountains having been unusually small both in the
early and latter months of the past year. The most interesting and important circumstance connected with the experiments
in 1850, is the discovery of a mountain station which promises to yield nearly one-
third more rain than the celebrated hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale, hitherto,
and with good reason, considered to be the wettest spot in Great Britain. The new
station is about a mile and a half distant from Seathwaite in a south-westerly direc-
tion, and 580 feet above it, or 948 feet above the sea-level, at the extreme southern

X termination of the valley ; it is on the shoulder of Sprinkling Fell or the Stye, about
= 100 yards south of the road leading over the Stye Pass to Wastdale.
