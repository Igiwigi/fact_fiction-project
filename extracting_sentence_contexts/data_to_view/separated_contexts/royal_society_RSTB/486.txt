SPENCER AND V. HORSLEY ON THE CHANGES PRODUCED

One special feature of our experiments has been the application of pressure in
different regions of the brain. This we have done for a special purpose which we
do not allude to in the present paper, since we do not feel ourselves to be in possession
of facts, even yet, whence to draw accurate inferences. However, by moving the
point of pressure we have found that additional light has been thrown upon the subject
of the present paper, for the effects obtained by the application of the pressure directly
to the fourth ventricle have proved so clear, that we have separated them into a
distinct class of observations, and used them to explain the results of the application
applied to any part of the brain. Therefore, the first great; division of our results is
as follows :—

Division A.—Effects of pressure applied to any part of the cerebral and cerebellar
hemispheres.
