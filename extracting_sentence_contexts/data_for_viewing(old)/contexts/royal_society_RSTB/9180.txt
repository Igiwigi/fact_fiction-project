genesis imperfecta using MSCs) [15]. Moreover, depending
on the stem cells to be produced—either for autologous
(use of expanded patient-derived cells) or for allogeneic
(use of cells from universal donors) cell therapy—the scale
of the cell culture devices will vary considerably. In the
case of an autologous treatment mode, usually many small-
scale productions have to be done, whereas for allogeneic
cell therapy, large cell stocks for many patients have to be
generated, meaning that in this case, very large culture sys-
tems are required.

Another very important difference between expanded
MSCs and PSCs is the fact that MSCs do not require separ-
ation from undifferentiated cells because they can be
directly used after expansion. However, this is not the case
for PSCs because these cells have to be differentiated at
least to the intermediate progenitor cell state. Since non-dif-
ferentiated PSCs have the capacity to continue to grow
indefinitively residual non-differentiated PSCs in a prep-
aration of differentiated cells can form teratomas in the
recipient—they have a tumorigenic potential. The use of
PSCs for clinical purposes requires therefore a 100% efficient
method to remove non-differentiated cells in order to pre-
clude this potential safety problem (see §6b for further
details). Basically due to this safety concern, up to now
