The firs result of the more severe criticigm to which the arrange-
Z ments were then s8ubjected was to show that sufficient thought had not been given
to the question of insulation. The wire composing the induetion coils, or rather one
Â© extremity of it, is necessarily ab a high potential, and a very moderate leakage from
2 the coils to the frame, and thence to the disc, might cause great disturbance. Some
Such leakage was in fact detected on application of appropriate tests. Ebonite ingula-
2 tion was accordingly introduced into the snpports of the coils. The battery was care-
2 fully insulated from the ground, as was also the frame carrying the revolving dise, and
Sother precautions were taken which ib is unnecessary here to detail, For the sake
'S 3 of definiteness one point of the 'galvanometer commutator was connected to earth.
