The iteration equation (4.2) is solved subject to the orthogonality condition,
M(Fo + 5F) =M(Fo), (4.4)

which reflects the fact that the values of the macroscopic fields M are fixed by the input manifold
Fo and only their fluxes are corrected.
The left-hand side of the linear equation (4.2) is referred to as the invariance defect (ID) of the

approximation Fo,
DFo

DM
Analysis of the invariance defect is the first step towards revealing the physical mechanisms
leading to correction.
