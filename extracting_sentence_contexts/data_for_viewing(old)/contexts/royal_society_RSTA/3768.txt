where £50 is the ‘background’ dielectric constant of the bound electrons and ions, Op = : 4
(Ne?/eg€oom)'/? is the plasma frequency, N is the carrier density, m is the effective mass and y : S
is the momentum scattering rate, responsible for the loss. The plasma frequency is typically in the :s
ultraviolet region corresponding to wavelengths of the order of 150 nm, while the momentum : S

relaxation time is on the scale of y + 104 s~!. For frequencies w < @p the real part of the dielectric
constant is negative and this fact allows sub-wavelength confinement in the SPP modes of various
metal-dielectric structures.

The origin of sub-wavelength confinement in metal-containing structures can be understood
from very simple energy conservation considerations [9]. In the dielectric cavity, the energy
oscillates between the electric and magnetic fields, just as, in a resonant electric circuit, the energy
oscillates between capacitor and inductor. One can also make a comparison with a mechanical
oscillator by noting that electric field energy can be thought of as potential energy, while the
magnetic field energy plays the role of kinetic energy. Once the dimensions of the resonator
become much smaller than the wavelength, the magnetic field decreases and eventually becomes
negligibly small—the well-known quasi-static regime. The energy balance between ‘potential’
and ‘kinetic’ energies can no longer be maintained and the mode ceases to exist as whatever
energy gets coupled into the cavity is radiated right back. But when free electrons are present, they
