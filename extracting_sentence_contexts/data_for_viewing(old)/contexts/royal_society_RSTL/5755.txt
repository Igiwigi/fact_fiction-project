fo These results confirm the influence of a non-metallic body on the conductibility of a
etal. It is interesting to observe that the influence of arsenic on the conduction of
Seat on copper is in ratio with the increased quantity of arsenic.
5 We haye also examined a great number of alloys with the hope of throwing some light
DM their chemical composition, and we trust that the facts which we are about to
pscribe will not only tend to illustrate this point, but will also be of interest from the
= and various results observed.
s We have also made a great variety of experiments with the view of ascertaining if
boa be a general law in connexion with the conduction of heat by alloys, and
2though we could not trace any general rule, still we observed several useful facts.
Z The conduction of heat by alloys may be considered under three general heads :—
S1, Alloys which conduct heat in ratio with the relative equivalents of the metals
ZSmposing them.
52. Alloys in which there is an excess of equivalents of the worse conducting metal
er the number of equivalents of the better conductor, such as alloys composed of
and 2Sn; 1Cu and 3Sn; 1Cu and 4Sn, &c., and which present the curious and
Wexpected rule that they conduct heat as if they did not contain a particle of the
