neighbourhood of the posterior commissure, and which pass, accompanied by two or
three much slenderer veins, to the lower extremity of the pineal gland, just behind

* I have not been able to demonstrate the actual opening of this branch into the Vena terminalis, but
it comes so close to the latter vessel as to leave but little doubt on the subject.

the dorsal sac. They then pass upwards, one on each side of the pineal gland, near
its hinder margin, and open into the sinus longitudinalis just where the latter parts
company with the pineal gland. These veins are in intimate contact with the walls
of the pineal gland throughout the upper part of their course, in fact they lie
beneath the investing pia, and no doubt convey venous blood from the hinder part
of the pineal gland to the s¢nus longitudinalis.

4. Vene bigeminales superiores (fig. 1, v.b.s.).—A group of large veins (five in the
specimen investigated and figured) arising from between the optic lobes and passing
up to open into the sinus longitudinalis close to one another and close to the
parapineal veins. There appear to be two pairs of superior bigeminal veins just
behind the pineal gland and an unpaired fifth one a little further back.

4a. Vena interbigeminalis longitudinalis (fig. 1, v.7.1.).—I propose this name
for a rather large unpaired vein which lies deep down in the fissure
between the optic lobes and immediately upon the roof of the iter in the
