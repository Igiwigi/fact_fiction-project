By homotopy invariance, the Morse index is equal to the number of crossings
on I),; these are precisely the conjugate points in (—00, L). In lemma 2.11, we show that there are no crossings along ,, or 1, provided Ao is chosen
large enough. This follows from the structure of H; and the fact that its spectrum is bounded from
below uniformly in L. Crossings along 13,, (when s = L and 4 € [—A.9,0]) correspond to eigenvalues of the operator
Hy defined in (1.3), hence Mor(H_) equals the number of crossings on 13,,, counting multiplicities. On the other hand, a local computation shows that all crossings along I, have the same sign
(lemma 3.3).
