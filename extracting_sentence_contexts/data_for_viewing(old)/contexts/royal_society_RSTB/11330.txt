were small differences in the apparent potencies. These differ-
ences are likely (at least in part) to be due to the different assay
conditions for the KDM and RDM activities, namely, the
enzyme concentrations used due to KDM4E catalytic efficiency
being 20-fold higher for the H3(1-15)K9me2 peptide than for the

H3(1-15)R2me2a peptide (electronic supplementary material, Figure 3. View from overlaid X-ray crystal structures of KDM4A complexed

sites of the JmjC demethylases and the fact that all tested inhibi-
tors work either by chelation with the active site iron or by
chelating iron in solution [2]. Although the RDM activity of
the JmjC KDMs has not been verified in a cellular context, the
results clearly highlight the need to consider potential activities
beyond KDM catalysis when considering the effects of JmjC
demethylase inhibitors, whether in pharmaceutical form or
when produced endogenously, as is the case as a consequence
of TCA cycle enzyme-associated mutations [37,39,43].

Given the apparent promiscuity of at least some JmjC
demethylases [33], activities beyond KDM/RDM catalysis
should also not be ruled out. In this regard, it is notable that
