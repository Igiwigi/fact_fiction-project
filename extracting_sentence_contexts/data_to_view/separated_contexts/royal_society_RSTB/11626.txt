Species that have more of a
selective foraging behaviour that focuses on woody plants
can be very important to grassland conservation by altering
woody plant encroachment and diversity even if they are
not dominant [34]. In some cases in the North American
Great Plains, prairie dogs may be keystone species that influ-
ence large herbivore distribution, plant species composition
and biodiversity. In fact, the widespread changes in the distri-
bution and abundance of small herbivores have probably led
to more significant plant community change than have
changes in large herbivores. For example, the elimination of
the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys Iudovicianus) in some
parts of its distribution can contribute to increased woody
cover and shifts in the herbaceous plant community [35â€”
38]. Black-tailed prairie dog populations are now estimated
to be at only 2% of their historic levels and may have histori-
cally had an equivalent landscape-level impact to large
herbivores and fire [39,40].
