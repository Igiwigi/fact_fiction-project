animal was kept under its influence throughout the whole of the experiment, at the ter-
mination of which it was invariably killed while still under the influence of the narcotic.

The part played by the influence of the anesthetic in experiments such as those
which I am about to record is so important that I feel compelled to insist on this, in
spite of the fact that others (Hooper, Semon and Horstry) have recognised its
importance before me, for there are unfortunately still those who pay no regard to
the degree of narcosis, a fact which accounts for much of the contradictory results
which have been obtained. It is of the greatest importance that we should carefully
note the depth of anesthesia at the moment of excitation of any given area of the
cerebral cortex, for there can be no question that the differentiating effect of ether is
such that totally different effects may be obtained from the same focus at different
stages of narcosis, owing, no doubt, to the fact that some centres succumb under its
influence before others.

IV. Certain Preliminary Considerations.

As marked differences are known to exist in the peripheral laryngeal apparatus in
animals according to their age and the precise stage of narcosis at which Faradic
excitation of the recurrent laryngeal nerves is employed, it appears to me of primary
importance that in any investigation of the condition of the central apparatus of a
given animal, we should have some idea whether such differences in the peripheral
apparatus can in any way influence the effects obtained from the central apparatus.
For without such knowledge differences may be wrongly attributed to the central
apparatus which in reality depend on peripheral conditions. It will, I take it, not be
