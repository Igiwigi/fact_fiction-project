(8) Degeneration of fibres after excision of portions of the cortex cerebri.
gWe will now briefly state the more important facts determined by the above
iathods of experiment, postponing for the present any criticism.

2 1. Excitation Experiments on the Cortex.
Ey was first observed by Hirzie,* later by Ferrier,t ALBertoni,{ and Munk,§ and
equently by Franck and Prrres,|| that powerful excitation of one hemisphere in
ip Carnivora produced movement not only of the corresponding or opposite side of
Te body, but also of the same side as that stimulated.
Franck and Pirres|| showed further that when the muscles of the same side were
ilown into action they contracted ‘01 second later than those of the opposite side, a
mdst important observation.
UBNOFF and HempENHAIN,1 CARVILLE and Duret,1 confirmed these facts.
J Antoxe** observed that while in dogs bilateral representation of the facial muscles
igs very constant, in the limbs on the contrary, unilaterality was the rule, but that
this there were exceptions. His views were confirmed by UNVERRICHT.
SLEWASCHEWTtt noted that the movement on the opposite or corresponding side was
a coordinated one (like a voluntary action), whereas that of the same side, besides
being late, was only a simple tonus.
