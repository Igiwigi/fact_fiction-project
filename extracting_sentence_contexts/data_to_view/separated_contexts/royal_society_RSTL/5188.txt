of verantine, in the other case to a mixture of 3 equivs. of
alizarine and 1 equiy, of verantine. A till more manifest proof of the fact of purpurine
not being a substance of uniform composition, is derived from an examination of the
liquid from which these specimens were deposited. To the bright red liquid from
which the last was deposited, I added after filtration muriatic acid and boiled. A
yellow precipitate was produced, which was collected on a filter and washed.
