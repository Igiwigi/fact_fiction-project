one on each side of the middle line; thence they diverge as they proceed backwards
and forwards, exposing the vomers behind and forming a deep sulcus in front which
is closed above by the approximation of the limbs of the processes. The vomers are

The Lower Jaw (Text-fig. 2, Secs. 35-507).—The first attempt ata detailed
description of the lower jaw was made almost a century ago by pe LA BecHe and
ConyBeare (loc. cit.), who illustrated their account with numerous transverse sections.
They noticed the absence of a vacuity, but in their identification of the constituent
bones they mistook the surangulare for the coronoid, which they do not seem to have
observed. In a subsequent paper ConyBrare (Joc. cit.) gives better figures of
transverse sections, but does not correct his original mistake ; he introduces, however,
a new element which he styles the “ crescent-shaped bone.” This is, in fact, the true
coronoid or rather goniale, and is faithfully represented in its relation to the splenial
and other bones in his figures; indeed the lateral view which he gives of this region is
even more correct than that of his successor, the great Cuvier himself.

Cuvisr’s* description, illustrated by figures of the outer and inner side of the
jaw, is of course excellent, all the bones are represented and correctly named, but the

coronoid (goniale) is made to terminate behind just in front of the coronoid process
and thus assumes a misleading resemblance to a true coronoid. ‘This error may have
