a) Limitations of the study

The frameworks presented some limitations. First, rhythm-based cardiac abnormalities were
not properly handled by our methodology. Given the fact that an altered rhythm may or may
not affect the regularity of the occurrence of any waves, it was not possible to define the one-
to-one match between the cardiac abnormality and a specific ECG wave. For example, Brady

bradycardia), one of the class detected correctly by the network (recall of 0.53), refers to a


very low heart rate. Typically, heart-rate alterations are quantified looking at the time intervals
between consecutive R peaks because of their ease of detection. However, the frameworks found
the P-wave very important for this class (figure 2a). Given the fact that the P-wave does not
change during bradycardia, the assessment of the low heart rate might have been performed
by the network ‘looking’ at the rate of both P-wave and QRS complex. Similarly, the frameworks
found the T-wave relevant for the detection of AF (atrial fibrillation), which is characterized by the
absence of the P-wave, an oscillatory pattern on the ECG baseline and irregular heart rate. In this
case, the frameworks hint that the network may use samples between consecutive beats where the
T-wave, the isoelectric line, and part of the P-wave are located to detect AF. The same observation
is shared by the work of Mousavi et al. [19], where an attention mechanism was used to show that
the network relied on samples between consecutive beats to detect AF. Thirdly, PVC (premature
ventricular contraction) have a morphology which is largely different from a normal sinus beat.
Therefore, considering the portion of the ECG where the P, QRS and T-waves are usually located
was not relevant (the different ECG waves had a similar low RV value).
