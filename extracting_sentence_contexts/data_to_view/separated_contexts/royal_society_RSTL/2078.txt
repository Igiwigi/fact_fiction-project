Finding that acid and
Z alkaline substances, even when existing in the most solid
Z combinations, or in the smallest proportion in the hardest
4 bodies, were elicited by Voltaic electricity, I established that
Z they were the results of decomposition, and not of composi-
S tion or generation ; and referring to my experiments of 1800,
S and 1801 and 1802, and to a number of new facts, which
E showed that inflammable substances and oxygen, alkalies
EZ and acids, and oxidable and noble metals, were in electrical
= relations of positive and negative, I drew the conclusion,
S that the combinations and decompositions by electricity were re-
E ferrable to the law of electrical attractions and repulsions, and
= advanced the hypothesis, © that chemical and electrical attrac-

ton were produced by the same cause, acting in one case on parti-
cles, in the other on masses ;** and that the same property, under

Whoever will take the trouble to read the Bakerian Lecture for 1806, will be con-
vinced of the gradual deyelopement of the whole subject from the investigation
respecting the pretended formation of muriatic acid and fixed alkali.

390 Sir Humeury Davy on the relations of

different modifications, was the cause of all the phenomena exhi-
bited by different Voltaic combinations. Believing that our philosophical systems are exceedingly
imperfect, I never attached much importance to this hypo-
thesis ; but having formed it after a copious induction of
facts, and having gained immediately by the application of it
a number of practical results, and considering myself as
much the author of it as I was of the decomposition of the
alkalies, and having developed it in an elementary work, as
far as the present state of chemistry seemed to allow, I have
never criticised or examined the manner in which different
authors have adopted or explained it,—contented, if in the
hands of others' it assisted the arrangements of chemistry or
mineralogy, or became an instrument of discovery. And
having now given what I believe to be a faithful sketch of its
origin, I shall not enter into an examination of those works
which have induced me to make this sketch, and which con-
tain partial or loose statements on the subject, and which
refer the origin of electro-chemistry to Germany, Sweden
and France, rather than to Italy and England and which
attribute some of the views of the science, which I first deve-
loped, to philosophers who have never made any claim of the
kind, and who never could have made any, as their works
on the subject were published many years after 1806. III.
