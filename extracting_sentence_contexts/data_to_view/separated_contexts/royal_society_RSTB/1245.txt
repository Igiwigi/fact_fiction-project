De any Vascular Cryptogams show a distinct part which may be correlated

Sion, structure, development, and function with the sporogonial head of the

yta?

the sporangia ever borne in such relation to one another as to suggest a
pene by sub-division of simpler parts ?

81s there direct evidence in any Vascular Cryptogams of conversion of potential
ous tissue into masses of sterile tissue, or conversely of conversion of sterile
, to spore-producing cells ?
4B) quite aware that, even if all these questions were answered by abundant
ithe in the affirmative, this would not afford complete proof of the mode of
of Vascular Cryptogams from simpler Bryophytic forms. Few biological
fBeses are completely proved, or even susceptible of proof, under the present
rSf nature. But what I submit is, that the search for answers to such questions
x2 above may, in the light of the facts already derived from the study of the
Bhyta, go far to support the working hypothesis above sketched in its broad
188, and raise it to the position of a reasonably probable theory. SS
