Figure 1. Illustrating the proof of theorem 3.1. When A... is large enough, there are no crossings on 77, and 4, and the Morse
index equals the number of crossings on 3. By homotopy invariance, the Morse index is equal to the number of crossings
on I),; these are precisely the conjugate points in (—00, L).

In lemma 2.11, we show that there are no crossings along ,, or 1, provided Ao is chosen
large enough. This follows from the structure of H; and the fact that its spectrum is bounded from
below uniformly in L.

Crossings along 13,, (when s = L and 4 € [—A.9,0]) correspond to eigenvalues of the operator
Hy defined in (1.3), hence Mor(H_) equals the number of crossings on 13,,, counting multiplicities.
On the other hand, a local computation shows that all crossings along I, have the same sign
(lemma 3.3). This important monotonicity property implies that |Mas(13,,,D))| is equal to the
total number of crossings, and hence is equal to the Morse index of Hy.

Finally, Mas(I2,,D) is the Maslov index of the boundary value problem (1.3) with 4 =0.
Another local computation shows that all crossings along [1 have the same sign (lemma 3.4).
This means, in particular, that Mas(I>,,D) is equal to the number of crossings along I>, counted
with multiplicity.
