The artery of course did
not, collapse as the vein had done in the preceding experiment; but the blood
was propelled along the yessel, s0 that it no longer appeared distended with it. It was at once evident, from the change of appearance in the vessel, that the
greater part of the blood had passed on in a direction perpendicularly opposed
to its gravity.. It is worthy of remark, that the blood of the artery was pro-
pelled neither 80 rapidly nor 80 completely as that of the vein, the cause of
which will be evident in the observations I am about to make on the nature
of the function and powers of these yessels. 7

When the whole of the preceding facts are considered, it will, I think, be
admitted that the circulation is performed by the combined power of the heart

and blood-vessels themselves, and that no auxiliary power is necessary for its
perfect performance. Here, as in other cases, the more we study the opera-
tions of nature, the more direct and simple we find them. The resilient power
of the lungs and elasticity of the yentricles of the heart, as far as they exist,
favour the free entrance of the blood into these cavities, an office adapted to the
feebleness of such powers, which, in many animals we have seen, have no exist-
ence.
