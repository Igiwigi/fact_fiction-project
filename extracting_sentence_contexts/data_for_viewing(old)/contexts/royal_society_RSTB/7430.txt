The theory of head evolution in the Arthropoda presented by Snodgrass in criticized. The evidence
for the view that the unsegmented acron includes the anterior region and the antennular and antennal
segments in Crustacea, and the antennal segment in Myriapoda and Insecta, is considered to be
unsound. It is suggested that this theory raises profound difficulties when applied to the Arthropoda.
On the evidence now available, the Onychophora appear to show the lowest grade of arthropodan
head evolution, three cephalic segments being present, only one of which has become pre-oral
(pp. 555, 556).

The foundations of the theory of head segmentation in Annelida and Arthropoda put forward by
Henry, Ferris and Hanke are criticized (p. 561).

The theories concerning primary and secondary metamerism are reviewed and a somewhat
different interpretation of the facts is suggested. It is pointed out that primary and secondary
metamerism must tend to appear in association with the possession of early-swimming larvae in
which a premium is put on the early functioning of some parts of the body. The phenomenon is not
considered to be primitive, as has been claimed. It is here suggested that the absence of a differentia-

tion into primary and secondary segments in the Onychophora and certain Annelida is a primitive
feature (p. 546).

The origin of many-segmented animals (p. 546) and the origin of metamerism are considered
(p. 552). The suggestion by Snodgrass that metamerism arose in the ectoderm is not supported.

Other items arising out of Snodgrassâ€™s conception of arthropodan head structure are considered
(p. 560).
