The finite-difference expression
for a derivative at the end-point 0 of a range is given by

h(dw/dx), = AkR—4A3-+4A3—JA$+.... (A.7)

This formula, however, is rather slowly convergent, and an alternative method is preferable. In this second method the equation (A. 6) is applied at boundary points such as 0 in
figure 1, as well as at internal points. A ‘fictitious’ point —1 is now introduced, and the
boundary condition is used to obtain its value, in terms of those at points on and internal to
the boundary, from a much more rapidly convergent expression. 44 I 2 oil. 2

With reference to figure 2, it can be shown that at a boundary point such as 0 the derivative
is given by

h(dw/dx), = AL, os ius M,, (A. 8)
