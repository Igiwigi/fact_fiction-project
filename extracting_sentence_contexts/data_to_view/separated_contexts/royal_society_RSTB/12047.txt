In contrast to sequential
properties, there is strong evidence that birds use the acoustic
features of individual calls to extract important biological
information [42,43]. Until recently, the sensitivity to complex acoustic sequences
in birds has not been tested rigorously in the laboratory except
for the dramatic effects of deafening on vocal learning and the
subsequent production and maintenance of species-specific
vocal behaviour in adulthood [11,44,45]. This gap in knowl-
edge has occurred despite the fact that we know how
important specialized perceptual sensitivities are for human
speech learning and production [46]. In part, this is because
auditory perception is inherently more difficult to study in
birds compared with recording and analysing vocalizations. As the human and avian auditory systems are quite different
in many respects, one can worry whether complex sounds
are perceived differently by birds and humans [47-49].
