organizing centre centriolar material (PCM) structure with little avail. This is probably owing to

limitations in methodology, but also to the fact that the PCM does not behave

like most ordered proteinacious assemblies. In the earliest electron micrographs

depicting centrosomes in situ, the PCM appeared as a densely stained amorphous

mass that surrounded the highly structured centrioles [1]. Electron microscopy

e-mail: hyman@mpi-cbg.de (EM) micrographs of centrosomes isolated from mammalian cells did little to
resolve the amorphous mass any further, although these experiments definitively
showed that microtubules (MTs) originate from the PCM (figure 1) [2] and that
PCM integrity is sensitive to chelating divalent cations [9].
