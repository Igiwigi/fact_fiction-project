The mechanism of VR is elucidated in
different systems with constant mass[1], and also extended to encompass systems with position-
dependent mass (PDM) [11]. Compared to stochastic resonance, VR is easy to realize due to
the ease of the implementation of intentionally injected high-frequency vibrations into nonlinear
systems, especially in devices vibrations or jitter are already naturally present [31]. Motivated by
this fact, we argue that the VR effect deserves to be extensively investigated in nonlinear devices
within the framework of statistical signal processing. In the field of statistical signal processing, in general the optimal signal processor is often
too complex or intractable and we have to therefore employ suboptimal processors to deal
with demanding signal processing tasks [32-34]. Moreover, for engineering applications such as
remote sensing and environmental monitoring, a number of low-cost sensors with a few bits,
e.g. quantizers, are often deployed over a sensing field to compose sensing networks.
