surface, damage to screw threads, etc., the heat treatment was carried out in vacuo.
The specimens were put into a silica tube, which was exhausted by means of a Cenco
Hyvae pump capable of producing a vacuum of less than 0-001 mm. The tube was
placed in an electric furnace, and the temperature observed by a platinum platinum-
rhodium thermocouple placed as close as possible to the vacuum tube in the neigh-
bourhood of the specimen. Steels A and B were heated slowly to 900° C., and main-
tained at that temperature (as recorded by the thermocouple) for half an hour. This
is rather longer than might appear necessary for a normalising process, but owing to
the fact that the surface remained untarnished, and was consequently highly reflecting,
the specimen would take longer to reach the furnace temperature. The tube was then
withdrawn, and the specimen allowed to cool by radiation.

In the case of steel C the specimens were allowed to cool in the furnace. Some
preliminary tests seemed to indicate that the yield point of this steel was not entirely
unaflected by the rate of cooling, and as the rate of cooling in the normalising process
was greater in the small tension and torsion specimens than in the cylinders, it was
considered better to avoid lack of uniformity from this cause by allowing the cooling
to take place in the furnace, which, owing to the mass of material involved, took
place at a rate little affected by the size of the specimen.
