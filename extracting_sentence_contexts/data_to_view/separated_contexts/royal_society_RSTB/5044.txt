In many respects the imago resembles a regular urchin rather than a Spatangoid. In
shape it is almost spherical: the ambulacra are all similar (see fig. 2), apetaloid, and
already possess a number of plates in each column, The primary (terminal) tube-foot
is already a mere nodule, and can only be made out in sections. The inter-ambulacra,
too, are primitive and resemble those of a regular urchin in the arrangement of the
plates, and in the fact that each bears a well-developed spine (which has been termed a
primary spine, and probably corresponds to the primary spine in a regular urchin). The position of the mouth in the circular peristome, and of the anus in the dorsal surface,
add to the resemblance. But this resemblance is superficial, for already the bilateral symmetry of the adult is
apparent (compare figs. 2 and 5). â€˜The peristome, though circular, is situated somewhat
nearer the anterior than the posterior end of the body.
