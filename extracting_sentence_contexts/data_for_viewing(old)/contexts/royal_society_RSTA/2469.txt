be devoted to avoiding, suppressing and/or mitigating disruptions by using such techniques as
massive gas and shattered pellet injection. Much effort is devoted to predict well in time whether
a disruption has a likelihood to occur during the plasma discharge, such that measures can still
be taken to avoid the disruption.

4. Heat exhaust systems

In ITER, the steady-state heat loads on the target plates in the divertor will be in the order of
10 MW/m? under detached plasma conditions. Transiently, during Edge Localized Modes, the
heat loads can reach levels of a few GW m~? during pulses of typically 0.5-1 ms. Plasma-facing
components need to withstand these heat loads for a sufficiently long time to avoid too frequent
shutdowns to replace them. DEMO will feature much longer pulses, while it has much thinner
walls than ITER (which comes from the fact that the neutrons should not lose their energy in
the wall, but in the breeding blanket behind it) and therefore it is necessary to develop highly
radiative plasmas for DEMO in which most of the outgoing energy is uniformly radiated from
the plasma edge.
Mission 2 of the European Roadmap is based on three pillars:

(1) Develop routine and robust control systems for plasma detachment in a conventional
divertor geometry;

(2) Develop, improve and test new divertor materials and plasma facing components;

(3) Test alternative magnetic geometries to spread the plasma heat load over a larger surface
of the divertor.
