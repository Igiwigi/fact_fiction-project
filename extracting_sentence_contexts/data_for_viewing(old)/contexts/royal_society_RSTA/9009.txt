reinforced in the sun by a line of nickel.* This agreement is emphasised by the
presence of a background of dark continuous spectrum which is sharply bounded in
each of the two spectra by the outer two of the five lines involved. There is a similar
dark ground covering the adjacent group 3360°82 to 3360°63, which is also clearly
common to the two spectra.

* A nickel line in this position is given by RowLAND, but not by ExXNeR and HascHEK.


BAND OF AMMONIA, AND ITS OCCURRENCE IN THE SOLAR SPECTRUM. 363

The coincidences in the case of the central maximum as a whole are scarcely less
striking. The majority of the solar lines in this region in fact appear to be due to
ammonia, as will be seen from the table, where the solar lines from 3363'4 to 3358°0
are tabulated in full in order to bring out this feature. In this small region there
are 47 solar lines, at an average distance apart of 0°117A, and 37 ammonia band lints,
at an average distance of 0°149A. Thirty-four of the ammonia lines are either
represented directly by reasonably appropriate lines in RowLanp’s table, or fall upon
solar lines of recognised or probable metallic origins. The absence of one of the
remaining three lines is satisfactorily accounted for by its low intensity. In the case
of the outstanding lines 3361°61 and 3359°89, the solar line corresponding to the first
appears to be masked by dark ground extending between the adjacent solar lines,
while the second is probably included in the nebulous line 3359°936. The coincidences
are clearly too numerous and too systematic to be considered accidental.* Confirmative
evidence of their reality is afforded by the identity of narrow bright interspaces in the
