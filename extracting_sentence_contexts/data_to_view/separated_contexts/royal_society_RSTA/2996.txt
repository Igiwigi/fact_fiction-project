Although
Laplacian determinism challenges the notion that humans can act freely, insisting humans are
not shackled by Laplacian determinism does not actually clash with classical physics because the
physical actions of any human can be mimicked by an appropriately programmed and sufficiently
dexterous robot entirely in accord with classical physics. But now, following the discovery of
quantum mechanics, we find that insisting human actions are essentially independent of the rest
of the universe has an apparent physical consequence in the appearance of instantaneous spooky
action. The fact that this consequence can be placed in analogy with the apparent retrograde
motion associated with the Ptolemaic model undermines the argument for human independence. As such, it poses a new challenge to the notion that humans can act freely. The tendency for scientific advances to reinforce the case for a mechanistic model of ourselves
shows no sign of abatement.
