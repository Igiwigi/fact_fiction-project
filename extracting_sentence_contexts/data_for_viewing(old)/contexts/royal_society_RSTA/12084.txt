over the surface of the bath of metal ; it is, therefore, due to oxidation.

Ihave observed such fume to be produced in enormous volumes when the charge
has become too hot, and the converter is turned down during the “ boil,” so that the
blast instead of passing through the molten metal passes over its surface and sweeps
out the vapours of iron and manganese. Clouds of foxy-red smoke produced in this
manner I have seen rise to a height estimated to be at least 200, and even 300 feet.
The smoke is composed of little spherular particles containing oxides of iron and
manganese,

There can be no doubt that WEDDING was, in the main, correct in considering that
the non-appearance of the lines of manganese at the commencement and termina-
tion of the “ blow” is owing to the fact that the quantity of material volatilised at
these periods is insufficient for the production of a spectrum; but it may also be
due, at the close of the process, to the oxidising atmosphere within the converter.

The spectroscopic phenomena of the blow are undoubtedly determined by the
chemical composition of the gaseous contents of the converter and of the bath of
metal, the temperature of the metal, and of the issuing gases. The effect of rise of
temperature is to increase the volatilisation of manganese and iron.
