that “the elastic properties of the fibre as a whole are those of the single cell, which
is assumed to consist of an elastic cell wall, enclosing a fibrillar structure whose inter-
stices are filled with a viscous medium,” and that “ once this critical extension (HooKE’s
law) is exceeded, rapid extension commences and takes place chiefly by rotation of
fibrille. The rate of extension is determined by the viscosity of the medium within
the cell, and the elastic constants of the cell framework.” The main object of the
present paper is, of course, to offer an actual molecular interpretation of the elastic
mechanism, but apart from this, it will be seen that our conclusions regarding the
elastic contributions of the various parts of the fibre depart seriously from those of
Speakman. But it is too early at this stage to be dogmatic, especially with respect to
such a complicated structure as that of the hair fibre, and we wish merely to suggest
that the explanation here put forward accords most with the available experimental
facts: in particular it should be noted that there is no X-ray evidence at all that the
observed elongations of the stretched fibre correspond to a rotation of fibrille.
Neither from the X-ray photographs nor from optical examination under the micro-
scope do we find any indication of an angular dispersion sufficient to account quanti-
tatively for the features of the load-extension curve, and even if such an angular
dispersion existed, we must conclude from the properties of cellulose and silk fibres
that it cannot function as the molecular basis of true, long-range, elastic properties.{
Furthermore we now know directly from X-ray examination that extension of the
hair fibre is accompanied by a reversible, intramolecular transformation.

We know that when the hair cells are first formed at the bottom of the follicle§ they
are not elongated in the direction of the fibre-axis, but are grouped together in masses
