It is
clear that the Swan bands are an example of the Heurlinger Triplet bands. Kratzer
has explained the doublet bands by assuming that such molecules will have a resultant

electronic momentum, and that the molecule may rotate so that its own angular
momentum is either in the same or in the opposite direction to this. It would then follow
that while under are conditions both directions of rotation were possible for the BO
molecule, in active Nitrogen only one direction was possible. [A réswmé of these and other
facts is given by MULLIKEN in the papers already cited (4, 18).] ‘The physical mechanism
of this is, however, difficult to picture. Brre@x (12) has indicated several directions in
which Krarzmr’s theory disagrees with experimental data in the case of the CN doublets. The calculated doublet width and symmetry of the separation both conflict with the
experimental data.*

Curves have been drawn which exhibit the triplet separation as a function of the
rotational quantum number.
