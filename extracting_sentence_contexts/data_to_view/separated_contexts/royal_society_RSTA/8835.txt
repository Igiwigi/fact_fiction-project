With the lines as entered it is seen that
the means of the corresponding separations for the two series are both normal, although the individuals
are abnormal. This shows that both corresponding lines have the same limit, and the same sequent, but
that the latter shows a displacement from the normal value for the F, set. This is supported also by the
fact that there are a number of close lines to F,. For instance, (2) 33332-22 and (2) 33330-00 as (38,) F,
give respectively 33348°51 and 6°29 for F,. They are probably all F, lines showing sequence displace-
ments.
