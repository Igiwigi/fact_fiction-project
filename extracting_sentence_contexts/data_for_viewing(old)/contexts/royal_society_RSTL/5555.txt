PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE MEGATHERIUM. 365

With regard to the fossils from South America, unequivocally referable to the
Armadillo family, I had myself pointed out the generic distinction of that large
quadruped, some bones of which had been transmitted along with the gigantic der-
mal armour by Sir WooDBINE Parisn, and proposed for it the name of © Glyptodon ”
in Sir Wooppixe Parsn's work on Buenos Ayres *; and afterwards, stimulated by
the general tendency of anatomists and palzeontologists to regard the Megatherium
as being, likewise, a gigantic Armadillo, I entered upon a critical review of all the
facts of the case which at that time had been obtained, and communicated the result
in a memoir to the Geological Society, read March 23, 18394. The general con-
clusions from this memoir were :—

1. The opinions of Cuviszr and Werss, in favour of the Megatherinm being s0
armed, rest on no better ground than the mere fact of bony armour of some gigantic
quadruped and the skeleton of the Megatherium having been discovered in the same
continent. 1

2. The skeleton, or its parts, which have been actually associated with the bony
armour above mentioned, belongs to a quadruped distinct from and less than the
Megatherium.
