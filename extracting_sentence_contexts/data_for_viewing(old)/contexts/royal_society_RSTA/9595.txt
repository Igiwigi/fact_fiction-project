OF OSEEN’S APPROXIMATE EQUATION, 31

by (13), the solution will satisfy the requirements of our problem, to the extent that the
stream-lines for these irrotational velocities conform with the stream-lines of the actual
flow.

We may conclude that (16) will be a satisfactory approximation to the exact
form (11) of the governing equation throughout the whole of the “ speed-scale ” range,
provided that « is the velocity potential function appropriate to a cylinder of the form
which we are considering. For the experimental evidence (§ 5) indicates that the
actual flow pattern at high speeds does in fact approximate to the irrotational flow
pattern, except at points very close to the boundary of the cylinder and in the ‘ wake.”

7. Equation (16) can be interpreted, physically, in a number of different ways. For
example, ¢ may be taken to be the transverse displacement of a flexible membrane
having a tension (the same in all directions, but varying from point to point) which is
given by x. More important (because it might be made the basis of an experimental
method of solving our approximate equation*) is the electrical analogue, in which ¢
stands for the potential in a thin plate of material having variable conductivity y. In
our hydrodynamic application the form of x is of course limited by (15), in which «
is a certain plane-harmonic function; in the electrical analogue no restriction is
imposed on 7, other than by the requirement that it shall be single-valued.
