SATISFYING LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. ?

The remaining equations of this group give «; except for «,', in terms of «,! and «,,

Proceeding in this way as far as the (p+1)'" equation of X, a,...«, are all found
except for their first elements, while the first elements of these equations give
O 41-04), O54, being not a priori independent of 2,'...7,) hitherto unknown.

It has been shown above, however, that the determination of 6',_, does not require
a knowledge of a’.

In general, in fact, 6',-, is given independently of a;'...0,).

To prove this, the way in which «;,' enters into «*,,, will be first considered. This
may be stated as follows :—

The coefficient of a' in a*,,; is equal to that part of «,* which is independent of
in eer

For 7 = 1 this is at once seen by writing down the equations
