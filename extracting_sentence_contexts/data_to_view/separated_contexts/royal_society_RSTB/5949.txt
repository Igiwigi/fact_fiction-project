HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES.

attachment takes place, and in this connection it should also be mentioned that the
marginal trophoblast in the somewhat older blastocyst, when it happens to come into
contact with the uterine epithelium, is capable of giving origin to small accessory masses
on either side of the primary one (ef. text-fig. 10 and Husrucur, *99, Pl. 9, fig. 63). And not only is the ectoplacental trophoblast of Tarsius unique in its structure and
character, it is equally without parallel amongst the other Primates in its behaviour
during the formation of the definitive placenta as we shall presently see. The facts,
set forth above, however, are sufficient in themselves to justify the conclusion that,
so far as its placental development is concerned, Tarsius took a line of its own, right
off the main track leading up to the Pithecoids. And the remarkable thing is that, in
spite of these initial peculiarities, l'arsius manages to develop a hemochorial placenta
of the trabecular type which is not so very dissimilar in its general plan of structure to
that of the Platyrrhine Pithecoids (cf. Pl. 8, fig. 54, with Pl. 16, fig. 96).
