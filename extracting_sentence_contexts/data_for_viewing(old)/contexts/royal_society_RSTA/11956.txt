PerKryâ€™s molecular rotation constants, and the viscosity coefficients of the same
series of acids. In each of these cases a law is found to hold for all the members of
the series except the first one or two.

It appears, then, that as a law to which marsh gas is an exception, one hydrogen
atom of a paraffin can be replaced by a halogen atom, without affecting the y of the
gas, and consequently without altering the internal energy of the molecule. This
result is similar to that which SrreckER obtained for the hydracids of the halogens,
for he showed that hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydriodic acids have all approxi-
mately the same y as hydrogen. It should however be noticed that he found the
introduction of a second halogen atom caused a large fall in y, the elementary gases,
chlorine, bromine, and iodine, having ratios nearly equal, but much lower than those
of the acids, from which fact we may anticipate a similar feature in the case of the

paraffins,

on the substitution products that have more than one
halogen atom in the molecule, and intend also to determine whether other chemically
similar atoms, such as oxygen and sulphur, or carbon and silicon can he interchanged
without altering the value of y. Until these experiments are finished, it would be
