A proposed
move to a larger f value, by contrast, is accepted with a probability which depends on T; (and
which converges to zero as Tj | 0). The constants T; are chosen to decrease to 0 at an appropriate
speed. In fact, T, may be called the temperature at time k and the name ‘simulated annealing’ arises
from an analogy between the algorithm and the controlled cooling used in the annealing process
in metallurgy. There are two main questions of interest regarding SA:

(i) Does the Markov chain (%;)x<j converge to an optimal parameter 6*?
(ii) How quickly does this convergence take place? The first question of convergence can be answered theoretically in certain specific cases.
