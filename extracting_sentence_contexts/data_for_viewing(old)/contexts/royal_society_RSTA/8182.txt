of Bailyâ€™s metal, of 1 inch square section and 38 inches long, has defining lines engraved
by Messrs. Troughton and Simms, the makers, on gold studs let into wells near each
end so as to be placed at the centre of the bar-depth, and these defining lines allow as
many as 45 interference bands (224 wave-lengths) in red light of hydrogen or cad-
mium to pass while traversing their thickness, although their edges are much
sharper than those of the metre or platinum-iridium yard, which are very ragged.

Thus after all the refined interferometry has been completed, the final comparison
has to be made with the interval between two such defining lines as have been described,
and although special devices and immense arithmetical labour were expended in getting
as accurate a result as possible for this final lap of the work, the results, as Professor
MicuEtson himself remarks in his book,* are nevertheless subject to this unavoidable
defect. In fact, the results cannot obviously be valid to a single wave-length, let alone
to one or two decimal places.

In an appendix to the memoir on the Wave-length Comparator which the author
devised for the Standards Department and described to the Royal Society in 1909,+
attention was called to some remarkable diamond-engraved wave-length rulings, lines
1/40000-inch apart on speculum metal, which had been made both for the Standards
Department and for the author, by the late much regretted Professor H. J. Grayson,
of Melbourne University. Professor Grayson, as is well known, had ruled lines with
extraordinary clearness as close as 120,000 to the inch, but for the practical purposes
of fine measurement his lines of 40,000 to the inch are pre-eminently suitable. For the
1/40000th of an inch is the wave-length of red light (H, being 1/38703 inch and Cd,
1/39450 inch). They are as clear and sharp as spider-lines, apparently at least a milli-
