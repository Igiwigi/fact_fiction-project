the absence of backed artefact assemblages may be a consequence
of too few documented assemblages occurring in a particular time
period and in a particular region to reflect an accurate signature
(for example, owing to a lack of archaeological field effort, which
is an important consideration outside of southern Africa,
ie. sampling zeros). However, the absence of backed artefacts
may also be owing to the test predictor of interest, in other
words, low population densities occurring in particular regions
at particular times (structural zeros).

As mentioned in the main text, in order to assess the reliability
of patterns documented in assemblages containing backed arte-
facts, additional models were fitted on the distributions of other
widespread artefact types in the African archaeological record.
These included points, scrapers as well as denticulates and notches
(here considered a single class of stone tool; figure 6, main text).
Note that all three classes of artefact occur as well in the archaeo-
logical record prior to the Late Pleistocene and were also made
by earlier archaic hominins in the Middle Pleistocene. These
other tools have, therefore, no demonstrable relationship with
cultural complexity characteristic of modern humans.
