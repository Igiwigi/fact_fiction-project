Figure 7a
shows the variation of peak FWHM (top) alongside the elastic strain in the crack-opening
direction (bottom) for a fatigue crack held under load at Kmax. It is clear that the peak FWHM
variation is heavily influenced by the crack-tip strain field. The fact that the broadening is
observed to vary significantly with loading condition and to follow the crack tip suggests that this
broadening is not primarily owing to the dislocations associated with the crack-tip plastic zone
(so-called type III microstresses). This broadening arises from the steep gradients in residual stress
sampled across the 60 um beam dimension. This is evidenced by the fact that the peak broadening
is a maximum not at the position of maximum elastic (and plastic) strain (figure 7a (bottom)) but
occurs just behind this where the gradient in strain is at its steepest.
