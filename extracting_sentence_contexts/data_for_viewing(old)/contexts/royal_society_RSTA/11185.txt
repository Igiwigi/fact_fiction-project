The agreement which here is by no means complete cannot be recognised at all in
the oxysalts except at low concentrations. In this respect our results differ from those
of ARRHENIUS, who gives the relation ¢ = k ./q as one of general applicability. The
chief cause of the difference in our results lies doubtless in the fact already mentioned,
that, with a solution of given concentration, much more salt was carried into the flame
in our experiments than in those of ARRHENIUS.

It is of interest to determine the variation of conducting power from metal to metal
of the series of salts investigated. This is most satisfactorily done by making use of
concentrations at which the individualities of the several salts of one metal have
disappeared. On account of the relatively bad conducting power of the lithium and
