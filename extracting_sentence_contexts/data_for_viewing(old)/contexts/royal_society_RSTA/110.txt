short intermittent bursts of energy dissipations. Although the initial and the final times of an
avalanche occur when e(f) > ¢ and e€(t) < ¢, respectively, its size does not necessarily correspond
to large or small values of € — ¢. In other words, large values of € can occur for both small
and large values of the avalanche size S. More precisely, the size S(k) of the avalanche can
be computed from equation (2.3) to give S(k) = [{/4) €(#) dt — o(te(K) — f(h)) with €(f) > @ for te
[ti(k), t¢(k)]. Upon denoting the event duration by 1(k) = t¢(k) — ti(k), the probability distribution
of S(k) can be obtained from the probability distribution of €(r(k)) = Se ‘e e(t) dt constrained by
the previously mentioned conditions on e(f). Furthermore, €(t(k)) should be computed in the
dissipation range and its fluctuations are correlated (with some non-trivial lag time depending on
t(k)) to the probability distribution of the large-scale velocity fluctuations, i.e. to the kinetic energy.
In summary, besides the fact that the statistical properties of S(k) depend on the inertial range
fluctuations in a complicated way, the probability distribution of P[S] should be self-consistent
with the fluctuations of the kinetic energy. Thus, the knowledge on the statistical properties of
