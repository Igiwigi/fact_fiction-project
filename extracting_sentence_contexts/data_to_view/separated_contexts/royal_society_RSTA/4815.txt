Therefore, the yield of singlets is 100% and the yield of the emissive
excited state (nr) is 0%. Although this example neither explains high efficiencies nor suggests the
possibility of higher-than-expected yields of the emissive singlets, it clearly demonstrates that the
spin-statistical 3: 1 ratio can be drastically perturbed, for example, by the energetic factor. In fact, the deviations resulting in an increased yield of singlet excited states have also been
proposed to occur in polymer electroluminescence as early as 1999 [14]. Although these initial
findings were supported by soon-followed experimental and theoretical work [15,16], more recent
studies suggest that the excited singlet yield of recombination is unlikely to exceed 25%. For
an in-depth summary of the fascinating evolution in understanding the recombination yield in
polymeric materials the reader is directed to a recent review [17].
