. 2289- Earl of Shelburne, on a viſit to Sir

James Caldweli and his Lady, we met with a
young man, whoſe caſe is of 1o'extraordinary a na-
ture, that we thought it might be of public utility
to examine into it ſtritly, and tranſmit it to your
Lordthip.

A great part -of his body is, within the ſpace of
two years, offified ; and the offification is continually
ſeizing more of the muſcles.

I have in the caſe barely ſet down the facts, with-
out any. reaſoning thereon. But, fo far as I can con-
jecture, there ſeems firſt to 00ze out of the joints a
kind of jelly, which by degrees grows hard, fills up
gradually the ſmaller veſſels, and concretes into bone,
If it goes on, I believe within a very few years the
man, if he can live, will be completely offified,
Perhaps it may be of ſome benefit to, mankind. to
have his caſe made known to the Royal Society, or
to the College of Phyſicians. ' Your Lordſhip's judg-
ment will determine beſt how proper this may be.

Vo, LI. N My
