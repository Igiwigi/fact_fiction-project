The integration of cell sizes and calculated PIC and POC in our cellular community
reconstructions illustrates that the size distributions across Palaeogene communities are strongly
biased towards relatively small cell sizes, with modal cell diameters of 4-5 pm at all sites, although
there is a broader cell-size range at open-ocean Shatsky Rise (figure 5). Superficially, all three
sites appear to show little variation in cell size distribution through time with no significant
changes standing out. However, cell diameter hides the fact that larger cells, even if at low
abundance, volumetrically outweigh smaller cells and this is clearly the case when we transform
cell diameter data into cell biomass. This first set of biomass plots (figure 5b) illustrates the
disproportionate contribution of the rarer but larger cells in the distribution of biomass across
the cell-size range at a constant abundance. The impact of large cells is particularly prominent
at Maud Rise, where the presence of Chiasmolithus results in the majority of community biomass
packaged into a few, large cells.
