"08 of a sufficiently high exhaust to give virtual shadows,* 80 that it can hardly be
Laid to have been proved to exist in tubes of ordinary exhaust. This cannot be denied,
ind we are not prepared with any equally rigid proof that it does 80 exist in tubes of
ow exhaust, although there are many cireumstances which point to 8uch being the
ae. In the firs place, we have the fact that all the phenomena obtained with
-ositive intermittence are Sharper in character than the corresponding ones that are
-btained with negative intermittence, pointing towards a less instantaneous action in
"he case of the negative discharge. This is a very well marked phenomenon, which
| vill be found to have been noticed by us in our previous paper, and is manifested by
bes of every class of exhaust. Another cireumstance pointing in the same direction
a peculiarity that has long been observed in the negative discharge, viz.: its prefer-
-Snce for a surface as compared with a point of discharge.
