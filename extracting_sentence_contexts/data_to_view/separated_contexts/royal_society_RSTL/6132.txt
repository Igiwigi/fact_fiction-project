After an
interval of sixteen months, on the ship being reswung in the same locality, which she
had not quitted, the deviations exceeded the original amount observed in England,
approximating to the value due to the increased magnetic dip at Vancouver Island. Similar features are exhibited in the Highflyer employed in the China seas. We have now to consider the magnetic nature of the hull of the iron vessel combined
with the steam machinery ; and in stating here the fact, of the former being, in the ma-
jority of the vessels investigated, highly permanent and but slightly inductive, in contra-
distinction to the steam machinery, I am only anticipating what will be hereafter given
in proof from examples in Table I.

The poxition of the standard compass with reference to the steam machinery in an
iron vessel, has therefore an important bearing practically and theoretically ; for if it is
placed in proximity to the funnel, which may be considered as the zero or measuring
point for the machinery in general, the inductive magnetism of the machinery is super-
added on the subpermanent magnetism of the hull, and complicates the question appa-
rently beyond research. An instructive practical example of this condition is afforded in the case of the
* Vulcan ' iron $hip: in this vessel the steam machinery is further aft than is usnal in
ships either of the Navy or of the mercantile marine ; and it will be observed that the

standard compass is only 27 feet distant from the funnel, and is elevated on the poop-deck
nearly to the level of the top of the latter. Viewing the nature of the Vulcan's hull
under the conditions of permanent magnetism, the maximum deviation, or ship's force,
