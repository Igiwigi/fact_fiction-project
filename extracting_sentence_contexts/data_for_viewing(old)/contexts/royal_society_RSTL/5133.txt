Dare liable to decomposition, frequently decomposing before sunlight can be obtained
Sy which to examine them, the red solution was concentrated by evaporation and
gpurified by alcohol, in which the orange-dispersing principle is soluble, as had already
ppeared from the properties of the alcoholic solution. The alcoholic solution thus
btained remained unchanged, at least for a long time, and had the further advantage
=pver the aqueous solution of presenting the sensitive principle more nearly in a state
Sf isolation, though it was still contaminated by some principle which dispersed a
Syhitish light under the influence of rays of high refrangibility.
Z 64. The blue colouring matter may be readily extracted by cold water, but is de-
Fomposed by boiling. The blue solution dispersed an orange light like the other, but
She dispersed light could not be nearly so well seen, just as would he the case were
She red orange-dispersing fluid mixed with an insensible blue fluid of a much deeper
colour, 80 that the mixture of the two would be blue. And in fact when the blue
Muid was changed to red by boiling the colour became far less intense.

E 65. It is stated by Sir Davip BrewsTes that a very remarkable example of internal
=dispersion, which had been pointed out to him by Mr. Scauxs, is exhibited in an
Wlkaline or in an alcoholic solution of a resinous powder produced from orcine by
Econtact with the oxygen of the air. Not being able readily to procure a specimen of
Zorcine, I tried archil, and obtained from it and litmus some very remarkable solutions.

In the fluid state in which archil is sold, the colour is much too deep for convenient
