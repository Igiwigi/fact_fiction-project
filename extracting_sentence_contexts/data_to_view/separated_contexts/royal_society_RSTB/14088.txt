The interpretation of the dorsal field as endoder-
(comprising a squamous epithelium with large cells) is mal tissue is further supported by studies of the genes
formed by a small portion of blastodermal cells that are serpent (srp) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (hnf-4), which are
directly opposite to the centre of the germ disc [27]. However, strongly expressed in the dorsal field cells and later in the
there are huge differences in the number of the contra-orbital midgut (but also in other non-endodermal tissue) [34]. The
cells, depending on spider species and egg size (e.g. fact that srp and hnf-4 are expressed first in the dorsal field
[16,20,24,27,28]). Live imaging of embryos from remotely and later in the midgut could also indicate that (at least
related spider groups (Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae) some) cells of the dorsal field later contribute to the
has revealed that during gastrulation, cells do not invade the midgut, but this is only speculative without further data on
contra-orbital region. This observation strongly suggests that the fate of the dorsal field.
