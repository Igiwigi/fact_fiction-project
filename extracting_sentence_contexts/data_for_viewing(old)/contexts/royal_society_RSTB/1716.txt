confirms the evidence obtained from more advanced stems.

We may, therefore, draw this further conclusion, as to the course of the vascular
bundles in the stem: the medullary bundles form the downward continuation of the
xylem-strands of the same leaf-traces which pass out through the cortex into the
leaves. The question now arises, How do the bundles behave on entering the pith,
and how is the alternation of the medullary and cortical strands to be accounted for?
The evidence on this point is imperfect, but certain indications are afforded by the
comparison of transverse sections. In the series so often referred to (C.N. 1198
1191) a bundle is shown in the uppermost section just entering the pith. As we
trace it downwards, it appears to attach itself to one of the adjacent medullary

below upwards.

ands, namely that on the kathodic side. Unfortunately the preservation of this
is not good enough for the course of this bundle to be followed with absolute
ce ainty.

One point, however, throws considerable light on this question. If we determine
» outermost leaf-trace in any transverse section, we know that its place will be
