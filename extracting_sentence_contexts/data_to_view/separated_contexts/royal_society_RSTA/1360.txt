The first of these
involves using observed storms and soil moisture
conditions and projecting how these may change into
the future. The second involves using climate model
simulations of the future and using them as inputs
into hydrologic models to assess the changed design
estimates. We discuss here the limitations in both and
suggest that the two are, in fact, linked, as climate
model projections for the future are needed in the
first approach to form meaningful projections for the
future. Based on the author’s experience with both
lines of reasoning, this invited commentary presents a
theoretical narrative linking these two and identifying
factors and assumptions that need to be validated
before implementation in practice. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue
‘Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and
implications for flash flood risks’.
