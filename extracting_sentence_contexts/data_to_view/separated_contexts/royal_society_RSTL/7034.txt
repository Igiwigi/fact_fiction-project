864 DR. A. MATTHIESSEN ON THE EXPANSION

mining the coefficients of expansion ; for although it appears a very simple one, yet, it
requires, T may ay, very great care to ensure reliable results. 1. Very often a series was rendered valueless by small hairs or particles of dust falling
into the water and attaching themselves to the fine platinum wire, as 0:1 or 0:2 milli-
gramme difference in the weight makes a considerable difference in the expansion of
those metals or alloys which have a low coefficient of expansion ; this source of error
was carefully guarded against ; in fact, if on taking the cylinder out to reboil the water
any particle of dust floated near the wires, the observations were considered worthless,
and fresh ones taken after reboiling the water. TI. When, for instance, the observations were being made at the highest temperature,
if by chance the temperature swk three or four degrees and gradually rose again, the
air absorbed at the lower temperature would be expelled, and an air-bubble would
sometimes attach itself to the metal and cause a false weighing.
