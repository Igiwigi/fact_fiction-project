using an auxiliary function that is invariant under G.

This result is true for general auxiliary functions, not just the quadratic one in (3.3) used
in the background method. When applied to the latter, it imposes structure to the generalized
background field v that reduces the number of optimization variables in (3.82) and, more
importantly, reveals which dynamical information the background method extracts from the
governing equation (2.1). The next example, for instance, proves that the generalized background
velocity field g for the RB convection problem in example 3.4 may be set to zero without
worsening the bound on the heat transport.> This confirms rigorously the recent observation [38]
that the background method as described above cannot exploit the flow’s momentum equation
beyond the ‘energy’ balances encoded by the quadratic term in the auxiliary function (3.3).

SThis fact was known to Charlie Doering, who described it to one of the authors as due to a ‘convexity argument’.
Unfortunately, we could not find a published reference to this argument.


Example 3.7. The Boussinesq equations (2.8) and the associated spaces U, V and P defined in
example 2.1 are invariant under horizontal translations and under the ‘flow reversal’ operation

w(x, f) Gw(Gx, t) -1 0 0
V(x} |] (Gxt) |, G=}] 0 -1 Of. (3.17)
p(x, t) p(Gx, t) 0 01

Requiring the quadratic auxiliary function in (3.13) to be invariant under horizontal translation
forces the generalized background velocity and temperature fields g and t to depend only on
