edge of the plates would account for one in the same direction as the second.

In a paper on the bearing of the phenomena of electric stress on electrodynamic
theory,t I had previously been led to inferences militating against the possibility of
dielectric polarization being of molecular type, from a comparison of these experimental
results with an electric traction formula including both the molar and the molecular
forcives. According to the present argument (§ 44), the latter forcive being separately
compensated, the difficulty there encountered does not exist. The remaining con-
siderations in that paper retain their validity; they show for instance that the
formule for the experimental reductions can be derived from a knowledge of the
distribution of the organized energy alone. But in the light of the present views,
we are no longer restricted or even allowed to consider the induction in a dielectric
as all of one kind; the total circuital induction is in fact made up of a material
polarity combined with an ethereal elastic displacement, giving an apparent but
natural complexity which it had previously been an aim to evade.

79. Experiments on Electric Expansion in Solids and Fluids.—The results
obtained in §76 may be applied to the discussion of a very thorough series of
experiments on electric expansion, made by QuincKE,{ which appear hitherto
not to have been correctly interpreted. Following the early experiments of
Fontana, and more recent ones by Govi and Durer, a condenser of the form of a
glass thermometer-bulb was used, and the expansion of volume arising from electric
excitation was read directly on its tube. By employing a long cylindrical bulb, the
