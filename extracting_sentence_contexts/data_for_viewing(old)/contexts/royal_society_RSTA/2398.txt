Major semi-axis of an ellipsoid approximation of the protein. x is deduced from fitting the experimental data to the model from
table1.

whereas it was shown previously that for TmAFP, x < 0.1 [35,37]. Therefore, the kinetic pinning
model does not describe the activity of TmAFP.

(a) The effects of the size and shape of the protein on x

Recently, Naullage et al. [38] showed that the value of x and the TH for a specific AFP depend
on the size of this protein, both upon its projection on the ice surface and its height. We plotted
x as a function of the maximum size (max(b,c)) of the protein and showed that x increases with
the size of the AFP (figure 3). When the AFP is larger, ice has to grow around it more in order
to engulf it, and the engulfment resistivity is greater [38]. This stems from the fact that engulfing
larger particles into a crystal is less favourable energetically [39,40].

In figure 3, there are two obvious exceptions to our claim, wsswAFPIII and TRX-AFPIII. We
explain these using the Janus effect. The non-ice-binding face of AFPs (specifically, the back side
of the ice-binding domain) suppress ice nucleation, making it ‘ice-phobic’ [41], as opposed to
the ice-binding face that promotes ice nucleation and is ‘ice-philic’. This difference between the
two faces is called the Janus effect. Recently, it was shown that water near the non-binding
face of the AFPs has a short hydrogen bond lifetime, and this is important for achieving high
TH [36].

Thus, increasing the size of the AFP by another particle on its non-ice-binding face should,
on the one hand, increase x, as was mentioned before, and, on the other hand, the fused particle
