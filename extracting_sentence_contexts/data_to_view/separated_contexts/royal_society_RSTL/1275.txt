In
the mixture of permanent gases, determined in this way, the
hydrogen, it may be remarked, bears generally rather a less
ratio than that of 74 to 26. 1 do not, however, consider this

fact as contradicting the accuracy of the proportions which
you have assigned; and it appears to me that a sufficient
reason may be given for the want of a more perfect coinci-
dence between results, obtained by snch different methods of
investigation. In the products of the electrization of am-
monia, the hydrogen composes nearly three-fourths of the
mixture ; and hence its combustion by oxygen gas is likely to
be completely effected, and the whole of the hydrogen con-
densed into water. But after the partial combustion of am-
monia, by oxygen gas, a residuum is left of hydrogen and
nitrogen gases, of which the hydrogen usually composes less,
and sometimes considerably less, than one half the bulk, In
this case, it may be suspected that a small quantity of hydro-
gen occasionally escapes being burned; and whenever this
happens, its proportion to the nitrogen will appear to: be less
than the true one.
