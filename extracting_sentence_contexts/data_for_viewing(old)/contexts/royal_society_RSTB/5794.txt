circles on the surface of a cone, a plane and a cylinder, enabled him to state the exact
relationships between the following three factors: firstly (a) the divergence angle,
secondly (b) the ratio of the sizes of primordium and axis, or the “ relative radius,”
and thirdly, the numbers of the contact parastichies.

The great value of this investigation is that it revealed the extent to which the
phyllotaxis system depends on the value of the factor 6, the relative radius. For
certain values of 6, only one phyllotaxis system is possible, but for other values of b
several systems are possible, with different parastichy numbers, as is shown in his book
in graph II, fig. II. In the second part of the book, in which these results are applied
to plants, Van Irerson investigated the positions in which the primordia arise when
the phyllotaxis is constant and when it is changing. He concluded that constant
phyllotaxis is maintained as a consequence of the following “ facts of observation,”
as he calls them :—

(1) The relative radius of the insertions of the new primordia (the factor 6) is the
same as that of the young primordia that are already present.

(2) These primordia are in contact with at least two older members.

(3) They are laid down in the larger gaps between the previous leaves.

(4) Small irregularities in the size or position of new members are eliminated during
the continued growth of the system or in the course of development.”
