In QBism, quantum states are represented by density operators p in a Hilbert space assumed
to be finite dimensional. A measurement (an action taken by the agent) is described by a POVM
H= (Hj), where j labels the potential outcomes experienced by the agent. The agent’s personal
probability q(H;) of experiencing outcome j is given by the Born rule

(Hj) = Tr pH}. (3.1)

The main achievement of QBism is the demonstration that this operational rule (which was
postulated by Born and which origin remains one the main mysteries of QM) can be treated as
a generalization of classical PU.°

In fact, this is generalization of Jeffrey conditioning [59,60], see §2, the transformation (2.5). But it seems that QBists have
never paid attention to coupling of QBism with Jeffrey’s conditioning.


One of the basic points of QBism is that the agent’s reference measurement is an arbitrary
informationally complete POVM, E = (Ej), such that each E£; is of rank 1, i.e. is proportional to a
one-dimensional projector 7.” Because the reference measurement is informationally complete,
any state p corresponds to a unique vector of probabilities q(E;) = Tr pE;, and any POVM F = (F))
corresponds to a unique matrix of conditional probabilities p(H;|E;) = Tr Hj/7;. QBists formulated
the following statement of a high intrepretational value: the Born rule can be interpreted as one
special form of transformation of probabilities:

(Ay) =f (q(Ei), p(HlEi))- (3.2)
