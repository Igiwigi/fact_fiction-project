for we have counted all the summits of one k-gon, viz. of the base.

In order, then, that such a g-gon should be possible, it is necessary that among
the p faces of our p-edral g-acron, there should be «, triangles, «, quadrilaterals,
«, pentagons, &c., of which the above equation can be affirmed. Now if q should be
odd, and all the p faces even-angled, this equation becomes

2%, +4%g+6% + &c.=2r +1,
which is impossible. Hence it appears, that if the number of summits of a q-acron
be odd, while the faces are all even-angled, the closed g-gon cannot be drawn through
its s1mmits. I find exceedingly few polyedra on which the closed p-gon and q-gon
cannot be drawn. In fact, it is far from being necessary to their existence, that all
the conditions of the theorems A and B $hould be fulfilled.

If we cut in two the cell of the bee by a section of its 8ix parallel edges, we have a
13-acron, whose faces are one hexagon and nine quadrilaterals. The closed 13-gon
cannot be drawn. But if a line be drawn from the triedral vertex to the opposite
angle of one of the quadrilaterals about that vertex, and this quadrilateral supposed
broken into two triangles having that line for their common edge, we shall then have
a 13-acron whose faces are one hexagon, eight quadrilaterals, and two triangles;
and whose summits are nine 7riaces and two tessaraces. * Of this figure the paradigm
can be constructed. Here I would fain beg the reader's permission to call a 5-edral
summit. a pentace, a 6- or 7-edral summit a hexace or a heptace. The words are at
least convenient in speaking of the summits of polyacra.
