system, patients blinded by lesions in V1 but with an intact ==
V5 can become aware of fast visual motion, whereas a patient
rendered akinetopsic (motion-blind) [58] by a lesion in V5
(c) but with an intact V1 can become aware of slow but not fast
motion [59,60], again suggesting that activity at each of these
two nodes can acquire a perceptual correlate, though a much
impoverished one.

6. End nodes in the brain?

Based on anatomical evidence, I have argued in the past [61]
that there is no end station in the cerebral cortex. This argu-
ment derives from the fact that all areas of the cerebral
cortex have anatomical inputs and outputs, and receive and
send signals. Consequently, there is no terminal station in
the cerebral cortex. While this remains true in terms of anat-
omy, it requires reformulating in perceptual terms. If activity
at each node of a chain can become perceptually explicit with-
out the need for further processing, then it is reasonable to
argue that, perceptually, there are end nodes in the brain,
activity at which can be perceptually explicit without further
processing. But, because, these nodes are recipient of feedback
connections, which may modulate their activity, it follows that
even such a modicum of perceptual independence does not
constitute an endpoint. The critical issue here, which I return
