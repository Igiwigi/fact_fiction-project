about the 4th of an inch in length, and those from the gigantic femur of an Iguanodon,

454 MR, W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OP THE

facts is, that Mr. Quzekerr's objection to the arrangement of the Lepidosiren amongst
fishes, as proposed by Professor Owen, derived from the form of its lacunze, is not a
valid one.

On viewing the variety and complication in the arrangement of the elementary tissues
combining to form the scale of Megalichthys, it is difficult to resist the conclusion
that it must have been constructed on a very different plan to that followed in the
genera previously described. Iam satisfied however that snch has not been the case
to any material extent. We have seen that the results arising from the successive
organization of lamellz have gradually increased in complexity as we ascended from
Lepidotus and Seminotus to Gyrodus, Platysomus, Aspidorhynchus and Acipenser.
This complexity appears to have reached its climax in Megalichthys, at least 80 far
as refers to the fish that I have had an opportunity of examining. At the same time
