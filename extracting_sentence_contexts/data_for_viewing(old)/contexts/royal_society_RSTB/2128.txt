MR. FRANCIS DARWIN ON STOMATA. 581

Leirars has shown conclusively that the behaviour of the stomata is variable,
depending on the conditions in which the plant has been kept. Thus the occurrence
of nocturnal closure in Lilium, Impatiens, and Saponaria seemed in LerreEn’s results*
to depend on the hygroscopic condition of the air.

The facts that I have given on nyctitropic plants bear out this view, and it is one
which renders the whole problem so difficult of solution that only general conclusions
can be drawn.

My own view is as follows :—

=, (1) That the nocturnal closure of the stomata is not so complete as to prevent

a transpiration, but that it does greatly diminish it.

8 (2) That this degree of closure is extremely common in unspecialised terrestrial
