of ſulphur the ſame thing happens, but
an a greater degree ; for the vitriolic acid, having a much weaker
AttraCion for” phlogiſton than air has, abandons it almoſt en-
Airely to the latter, which is thereby converted into water, and Sn that form attra&ts the vitriolic acid, and reduces it to a liquid
te. '' The ſame reaſoning may be applied to the combuſtion
f phoſphorus, which is attended with ſimilar effefts,

S * T cannot take upon me to determine, from any facts which have come to my
Amnowledge, whether any part of the dephlogiſticated air employed in this experi- (/
Fvent is turned jnto fixed air ; but I am rather inclined to think that ſome part is,
becauſe the quantity of heat, which is ſeparated by the union of the two airs,
does not ſeem to be ſo great as that which is ſeparated when the dephlogiſticated
air is wholly changed into water: yet ſome water appears to be formed, becauſg
© when the' mixture is made over mercury, the ſolution of the mercury in the ni-
© trous acid aſſumes a-cryſtallized form, which, howeyer,” may be due to the watery

- part of the nitrous air,

from what 1 myſelf conſider till in the light of a conjecturat
hypothe F
T ſhall only beg your attention to
fubjeR ; which, however, may poſſibly ſerve more to thew the

uncertainty of other ſyſtems on the conſtituent parts of air, than
the certainty of this. Some of thoſe ſyſtems ſuppoſe dephlo+, |
, ompoſed of an acid and ſomething elle, |
If an acid enters into the compoſition of
it, why does not that acid appear again when the air is decom-
poſed, by means of inflammable air and heat?
