On the other
hand, there is a sequence (f),>1 such that fy > tmax,1â€”> oo and I ftw Ally [om] is unbounded;
that is, the distance between f (tn, f) and all f (tn, fd becomes arbitrarily large. This contradicts the
continuous dependence of solutions on the initial conditions following, on each [0, fy], from the
Gronwall-Henry inequality, [16, Lemma 3.2]), see also [1, Theorem 8.1.1]. a

Remark 3.7. The additional restrictions in theorem 3.6 are due to the fact that, in the general
case, we cannot control the production of particles; that is, the zeroth moment. In principle, there
is a positive feedback loop in which Mp contributes to M, which, in turn, amplifies, in a nonlinear
way, higher order moments that determine the rate of growth of Mo. The adopted assumptions, bes
which postulate that either Mo is controlled by My, or that the evolution of mass is not influenced [=
by other mechanisms (ro 4 0 implies that there is a production of mass independent of the existing :8
one), although technical, seem to be the simplest ones that break this cycle.
