v, over the range 6, = —20° to — 60° is given from figure 3 as 6 = 107 cm/s.
Then 5
dn’ = 8’n, 0-97d¢.
This is again a uniform phase distribution which includes the initial distribution if

mendh 6’ >1-03.

The analytical treatment thus confirms the result obtained graphically, namely, that a
value of 3’ about 1-05 is sufficient to maintain the number of electrons if they have any
reasonable velocity distribution.

In fact the calculated velocity of impact of the electrons against the end-walls (85 eV)
gives 0’ ~ 1-4. This larger value compensates for losses of electrons other than by the cut-off
process, in particular, losses to the side walls because the secondary electrons are not all
emitted normally from the end-walls.

(c) Effect of the wall-charge field

Since the secondary electrons are produced at different times within a certain phase
range, the wall acquires its increment of positive charge at the same rate, and not instan-
taneously. The wall-charge field therefore varies as the electrons move across the tube,
and only reaches its final steady value for a particular half-cycle when all the electrons have

left the end-wall. Those electrons which leave first (i.e. in the most negative phase) leave
