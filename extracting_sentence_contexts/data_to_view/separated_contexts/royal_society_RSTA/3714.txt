where £50 is the ‘background’ dielectric constant of the bound electrons and ions, Op = : 4
(Ne?/eg€oom)'/? is the plasma frequency, N is the carrier density, m is the effective mass and y : S
is the momentum scattering rate, responsible for the loss. The plasma frequency is typically in the :s
ultraviolet region corresponding to wavelengths of the order of 150 nm, while the momentum : S

relaxation time is on the scale of y + 104 s~!. For frequencies w < @p the real part of the dielectric
constant is negative and this fact allows sub-wavelength confinement in the SPP modes of various
metal-dielectric structures. The origin of sub-wavelength confinement in metal-containing structures can be understood
from very simple energy conservation considerations [9]. In the dielectric cavity, the energy
oscillates between the electric and magnetic fields, just as, in a resonant electric circuit, the energy
oscillates between capacitor and inductor.
