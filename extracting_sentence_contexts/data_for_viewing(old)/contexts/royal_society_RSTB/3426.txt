strain their production demands, or on the environment during early childhood ; but
if the M. death-rate is not, while the F. birth-rate is increased, then the result must
be ascribed to prosperity, whether that be a result of civilisation or not.

308 MR. W. HEAPE ON THE PROPORTION OF THE SEXES

The figures available for Cuba emphasise this point. Among whites the net
increase shows an excess of F., but it would be wrong to describe this result as
a consequence of increased prosperity, for it is due solely to an excessive M. death-
rate and the apparently favourable condition of this race in Cuba is fictitious.
Among coloured people, however, a much higher proportion of F. are produced ;
potentially in this respect they have advantage over the whites, but an excessive
F. death-rate at the present time annuls that advantage, and from the point of view
of increase they take the second place. How low this second place is a further
examination of the figures will show. Thus, whereas the death-rate of coloured
people is about equal to that of the whites, namely, one-third, their birth-rate is less
than one-fourth, and the excess of births over deaths little more than one-eighth.
The potential advantage, then, is limited to those who breed and has no relation to
the relative fertility of the races.

It has already been stated (p. 282) that coloured people in Cuba have been
decreasing in proportion to whites for the last half century.
