The panels, buttons and text boxes in the UL are therefore dently and had minimal overlap, there can be a significant
created from Python and mapped to Geppetto UI components degree of shared infrastructure. Geppetto proposes an

internal Geppetto API to visualize the cells and the networks, science applications to be built from reusable modules—as
run the simulations and plot the results. The idea behind this illustrated by the overlapping blocks in figures 2-4. This
approach was to retain backward compatibility with the strategy fits naturally into the open-source model—
numerous existing NEURON interfaces built with Interviews components and modules are more likely to be reusable
for various models.
