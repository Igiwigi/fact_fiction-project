mical difference between the particles of which they consist. On the chemical nature
of these particles I have offered no opinion. The apparent and obvious inference from
the experiments is doubtless that the elements form a peculiar group of chemical sub-
stances, consisting of similar particles or atoms in a state of combination, as other
bodies consist of dissimilar. Of this view, in the early part of this paper, I have already
spoken; it is the hypothesis of Amegrs. Many theoretical difficulties however meet
us, when we come logically and consistently to carry out this idea to the explanation
of chemical phenomena, especially to the phenomena of direct combination and to
the simplest cases of chemical decomposition; and it by no means follows that,
although the apparent, it is the rational and philosophical interpretation of the expe-
riments. Besides this view and that of Bgrze1avs, there is yet a third hypothesis
which we may form as to the constitution of these elements, namely, that they con-
sist of yet other and further elements. On this view, the real fact which lay hid under
these phenomena, might be the synthesis of the oxygen from the ultimate and further
elements of which the oxygen consisted. In the present state of our knowledge it is
useless to dilate on this idea; but on the assumption that the elemental bodies are in
this sense compound, we may, I believe, account for all these experiments without ever
as8uming a chemical difference between two similar particles; and it appears to me
perfectly possible, that in 8uch a constitution of the elemental bodies, these experi-
ments, together with the phenomena of allotropy, may find their ultimate solution.
