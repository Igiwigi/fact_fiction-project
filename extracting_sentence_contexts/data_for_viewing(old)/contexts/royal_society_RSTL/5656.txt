The extreme delicacy and softness of the chorium in the Prawn has prevented the
author from extracting it in such a state as to be fitted for examination from those parts
where the shell is thick, as the claws and ambulatory feet.

'The view which is here taken of the uses of the hairs, and which seems to be proved
by their anatomical relations, is one which has been considered by many as probable,
though, 80 far as is known to the author, no investigations haye been made which bear
directly upon it, except those of Dr. ArTahur FArRE on the organ of hearing in the
Crustacea®.

The anthor regrets that he had not Dr. Farre's interesting paper before him when
the present communication was first sent in to the Society, as it gives a beautiful illus-
tration of the fact of the hairs being made the instruments for the conveyance of deli-
cate impressions. He describes the hairs of the auditory apparatus as hollow, with
numerous granules—apparently nerve-granules—contained in them, while the auditory
nerve may be traced in the form of a plexus at their very base; and he considers that the
hairs or ciliated processes immediately overlying this plexus, exhibit an apparatus for
extending the extremities of the nerves in such a manner as to render them sensitive to
the most delicate vibration of the fluid with which the sac of the hearing organ is filled.
He is thus led to regard the hairs of the inner sac of the ear as representing a delicate
series of antennee.

The observations brought under the notice of the Society in the present communica-
tion, tend to prove the correctness of Dr. FARRE's views on the uses of the hairs found
in the organ of hearing, as well as of the general conclusion at which he hints, that the
