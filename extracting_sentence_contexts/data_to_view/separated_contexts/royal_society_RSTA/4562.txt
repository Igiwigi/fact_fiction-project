There are so many versions of the generalized Boussinesq equations that
there is no point trying to write them down in this short review. There are also the fully nonlinear


shallow-water generalized Serre equations [37]. They have been rediscovered several times and
are in fact used in FUNWAVE [38,39]. Implementations of these dispersive wave models are
in-house models or available as standard codes, open-source or commercial. The majority of codes
use finite-difference schemes.
