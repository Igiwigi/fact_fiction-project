First Method of Solution —Vhe general solution of (10.10) is

C0) = oye, a, = Bye“M, Eg = ap +g (a — vt,

wo") = By — Cg (a — v)t + dagt + fad, (« — v) #,

where «, 21, %2, ®, are arbitrary constants, but they cannot be left all arbitrary if the
solution is to have the desired form in which ¢ enters only through the argument ye” ;
we must, in fact, have

het ela dco — v) = 0, Ax», — C,(¢ — v) = 0,

and here we know that the third condition is in general satisfied of itself, while the others
give «,, @,;, % in terms of (sc — v). The right-hand sides of the equations for the
¢,, @,© are now known functions of t, and we may solve for the ¢,, w,, and so on.

Suppose that the ¢, 0, ...G", @,""-” have been obtained as Laurent series
in ye”; then the right-hand sides of (10.11) become known Laurent series in ye”, and a
solution for ¢,(°, «,\ is obtained by adding the “ particular integral ” solutions corre-
sponding to each term on the right.* To a term Ae" on the right of the equation for
¢,© corresponds the particular integral
