Now let D be any discrete subgroup of G. According to Malcev [21], one can choose a set of :s
generators of D, {c1, cz, ¢3}, such that [=

cz3= 0p forsomed ER, (cy,c2) = ck, for some k € Z. (6.9) DN

If follows that :8
(c1,¢3) = (€2,€3) = 0. (6.10) ~

One can use these relations to show that any group element has the form
ciel, a, B,y eZ. (6.11)

(G is not a commutative group, so (6.11) is a non-trivial fact. Recall, for purposes of comparison,
that an arbitrary point in a perfect lattice with basis e1,e2,e3 has the form ae; + Bez +
yes, a, B,y €Z.)

So, in physical terms, this group corresponds to a uniformly distributed system of screw
dislocations with Burgers vector kc3 (since successive flows along c2,¢1, cy 1 c! lead to ck =ke3).
Note that the integer k can be determined in terms of wz and p [22].

In crystallography, the set of changes of basis of a perfect lattice can be regarded as a symmetry
group (related to the cubic, tetragonal, etc., crystal classes)—in the case at hand, the different
choice of generators of D play a similar role [23,24]. For the nilpotent group G defined by (6.5) one
has also:
