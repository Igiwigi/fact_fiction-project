If, using these grouped figures, we plot brood size against the logarithm of the per-
centage of dextrals, we get a tolerably straight line (fig. 4), the quantitative meaning
of which is, approximately, that the percentage of dextrals is doubled for every drop of
25 snails in brood size,* giving the scale (interrupted line in fig. 4) :—

Percentage of dextrals. Brood size.
0-08 (1 in 1,250) aa eae 200
1 in 20,000 pari es us 300
lin 5 millions... ois or 500

Which fits pretty well with the facts that there is a limiting value of about 20 per cent.
dextrals and that no sinistral strain is quite free from a chance of producing a dextral.
These data unfortunately throw little further light on the question whether « and «
are qualitatively or only quantitatively different : they are obviously compatible with
the latter view, but they are not inconsistent with the other interpretation.

For the broods within an ¢ strain this relation does not hold (Table 13), nor does it
necessarily apply (though it may do so) to the substrains within an ¢ strain nor to the
fluctuations within a substrain from year to year. Nor are the E broods in stable «
strains smaller than the K broods. Like the proportion of dextrals, brood size is a
heritable character of strains, not of individuals or broods. This is what we should
expect on the chance distribution of dextrals among the broods of a group. If, on the
other hand, some real change in the constitution of a strain leads to a rise or fall in
