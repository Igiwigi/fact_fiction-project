groups of particles, exactly resembling a later stage in the aggregation of Euglena
(Plate 34, fig. 27; of. figs. 28, 29). The resemblance extends even to the darker,
denser central stream surrounded by a less dense peripheral layer (fig. 29). This less
dense peripheral layer consists of a more or less well formed vortex ring produced by
the friction of the water. In the case of Euglena, the lighter area around the denser
central mass is also of the nature of a vortex ring, but is not so clearly marked owing
to the upward movements of the organism,

Except for the fact that the cells of Euglena are capable of free movement, the
aggregation of the particles of a precipitate appears to be similar to the aggregation of
living Euglene.

Figs. 15 and 16 show the aggregations formed when dead cells of Euglena are
treated as precipitates; in fig. 15 the Euglenz are aggregating from a rather loose
surface film, in fig. 16 from a firmer and more coherent film. These figures, and
figs. 17 (manganese dioxide) and 30 (osmic dioxide), resemble very closely the
aggregation of living Euglene in fig. 10. In fig. 44 is shown the aggregation of
Chlamydomonas killed in a solution of osmic acid.

The aggregation of these various sediments appears to depend upon the fact that
a thin film of particles, together with the surface layer of water in which they are
