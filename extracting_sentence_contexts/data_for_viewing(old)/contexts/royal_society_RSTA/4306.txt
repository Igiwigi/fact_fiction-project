First of all it is still an open problem to prove the convergence of this technique even in one
dimension. In fact, in this case, the method reduces to the so-called EEMD technique, whose
convergence is not known. Whereas we recall that, even if the convergence of the MIF method
is still an open problem as well, its one-dimensional version, the iterative filtering technique, has
been proved to be convergent under mild conditions [4]. Furthermore, the MEEMD has been
found to be much slower than the proposed method. On an average personal computer, it takes
around 4s to produce the cleaned classification plotted in figure 2b, while the MEEMD runs for
more than 190s on the same computer to produce the result shown in figure 4b.

We observe that, with this dataset, the MF classifier gives results similar to ACE, so we avoid
presenting them and move directly to the COS classifier.

The pixel classification produced by COS applied to the raw hypercube is shown in figure 5a,
where we reversed the pixel classification values. We needed to do so in order to have meaningful
