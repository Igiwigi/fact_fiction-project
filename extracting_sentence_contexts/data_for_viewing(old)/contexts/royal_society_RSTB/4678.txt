That the distortion of the plates in the former zone is due to the presence of the
perradiad series of tubercles can hardly be doubted, but it is noteworthy that
distortion is the only feature there; there is no reduction. In the latter zone the
plate-grouping seems to have a more fundamental origin. Although the expanded
plates are again those that support large tubercles, it is clear that the reduction of
other plates is quite unnecessary for the accommodation of these tubercles. Indeed,
the reduction does not become appreciable until the transverse suture affected has
passed or even crossed the boss. Again, tubercles with scrobicules transgressing the
sutures even more widely occur on the adapical surface, with no accompanying
disturbance of the plating. In this orad region of plate-grouping we have an almost
perfect repetition of the alternate dyads and simple plates found in Acrosalenia
(Plate 62, fig. 4), with the sole difference that no true combination occurs. in
P. ornatus. The fact, noted above, that demi-plates are most marked in this region
in areas I and V (where the actual number of plates in these shorter areas is the
same as that in the others) suggests that the plate-reduction (and grouping) is due
to “ growth-pressure” rather than to any direct influence of the tubercles. On the
other hand, the relatively great height of the plates seems inconsistent with
compression in the ordinary sense. The grouping extends into the peristomial
invagination, and usually only one pair (rarely two) of normally alternating primaries
occurs on the margin.

There is reason to believe that the proximal peristomial ambulacrals are really the
first coronals of the areas. There are traces of slight marginal resorption, and
probably the extension of the branchial incisions has modified the plates adradially.
But since the primordial single interambulacral plate is constantly preserved, and the
