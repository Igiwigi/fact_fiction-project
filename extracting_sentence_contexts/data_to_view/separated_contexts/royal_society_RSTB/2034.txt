Polystely together with
secondary thickening is a somewhat unpractical combination, which could never have
reached any high development in the crude form in which it exists in Medullosa anglica. The steles, as they grew in thickness on all sides, must ultimately have got in one
anotherâ€™s way. The structure, as shown in all the specimens investigated, is, in
fact, not adapted to the attainment of arboreal habit. The difficulty is met in the
four species, M. stellata, Corra; M. porosa, Corra; M. Solmsii, Scuenk; and
M. Leuckarti, Gorr. et Srenz., by the differentiation of a distinct system of peripheral
steles forming a circle round the stem.
