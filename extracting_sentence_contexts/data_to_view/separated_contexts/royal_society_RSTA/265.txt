Two medials A and C, which have no point in common, form a basis, in the sense
that every point of space [2k—1] either belongs to A or C, or else is in line with a point
aofA and cof C. In fact the k-fold space containing A and any external point d intersects
the (k—1)-fold C in one point c: and the straight line cd, lying in the space Ac, must
meet A in a point a.

be the homogeneous co-ordinates of a point of [2k —1], referred to the medials A and C
as basis: that is to say, let any point of A be given by {x, 0}, and any point of C by {0, y}. Here x is to be regarded as a column vector of k components, as also y, while {x, y}
denotes a column vector of all 2k components in the above order.
