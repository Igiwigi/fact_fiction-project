On the other hand, modelling dependencies of the estimated components is an important
extension of the analysis provided by ICA. It can give useful information on the interactions
between the components or sources recovered by ICA. Thus, the fact that the components are
dependent can be a great opportunity for gaining further insights into the structure of the data.

(b) Correlation of squares of components

A typical form of dependence in real data is correlation of variances or squares (also called
correlation of energies owing to an abstract physics analogy). This typically means that there
is some underlying process that determines the level of activity of the components, and the levels
of activity are dependent of each other.
