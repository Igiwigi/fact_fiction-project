It has been shown in recent years that accompanying the more obvious distinctions
between the two generations a difference in their nuclei could be detected during
karyokinesis. In the examples of Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Gymnosperms, and
Angiosperms which have been investigated, the number of chromosomes was twice as
large in the nuclei of the sporophyte as on those of the corresponding gametophyte. The facts are collected in a paper by Srrassurcer,* and their bearing on alternation
