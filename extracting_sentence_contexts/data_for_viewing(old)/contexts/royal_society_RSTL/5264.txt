or in the ultimate hepatic ducts. The prevalent opinion among physiologists certainly
is that the bile is actually and necessarily formed in the hepatic cells; they are con-
sidered homologous to those of the renal tubuli, and on account of this homology
and a certain not very manifest yellowish tint, it is usually held that the bile is
primarily formed in them, and liberated by their dehiscence in the cavity of the duct.
From this opinion, which I long held unquestioningly, and to which I have often
referred, observation alone inclines me in some measure to dissent. I have scrutinized
numerous specimens of the livers of our ordinary domestic animals with a view to
determine this point, and still cannot convince myself that bile is present in the
parenchymal cells as @ normal and necessary condition. If present, it, ought not to be
very difficult of detection, seeing that it is a coloured fluid, and that the cell which
contains it is in this class generally provided with a distinct envelope: it ought, in
fact, to be as apparent, or nearly 80, as it is in the cells of the follicular livers of Mol-
lusea. But this is not the case; according to my observation the cells commonly
appear as pale granulous nucleated particles, with a more or less distinct limiting
envelope, and presenting a few or perhaps numerous and large oil-drops amid the soft
albuminous mass. Not unfrequently a distinct yellow fluid is seen infiltrating the
granulous contents, or several yellow highly refracting drops are observed in the
same situation ; this indicates of course that bile is present in such particles, but they
are seldom seen except when the liver is in a state of s0-called biliary congestion.
This condition is consequently most often observed in human livers. The cells, when
massed together and viewed by transmitted light, very commonly, perhaps always,
produce a kind of reddish yellow tint ; but this seems to me to differ decidedly from
the yellow tint of bile, and to be probably dependent on some diffused hematin
tinging the cells, or on some modification which the light has undergone by unequal
