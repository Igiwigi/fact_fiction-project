posite direction, by the influence of gravitation ; and I believe
the facts I have stated to be sufficient to support the inferences
I have drawn.* But the fibrous roots of plants, being much
less succulent, though not uninfluenced in the directions they

laws, and are generally found to extend themselves most
rapidly, and to the greatest length, in whatever direction the
Soil is most favourable : whence many naturalists have been
disposed to believe that these are guided by some degrees of
feeling and perception, analogous to those of animal life.

I shall proceed to state some of the facts upon which this
