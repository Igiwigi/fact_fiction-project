figure 1. Development starts with the design of the conceptual models to address a scientific
challenge of interest (Design Step). This includes selecting necessary single-scale models and
determining which of these need to be coupled directly. Next, the computational models are
adapted, and coupling mechanisms are implemented to facilitate the transport of data between
the submodels (Implementation Step). This can, for example, be done using coupling libraries or
workflow tools. Once the single-scale models and coupling mechanisms have been established,
the implementation can be applied to the specific scientific problem of interest (Instantiation).
This includes adding relevant data and parameters, e.g. force field definitions and initial particle
configurations for a multiscale molecular application.

After Instantiation, the application is made operational at the target platform (e.g. cluster,
cloud or supercomputer, Deployment Step), upon which it is (initially) run (Execution Step).
Deployment is complicated due to the fact that various single-scale models and their coupling
have to be orchestrated, potentially on a heterogeneous platform (CPU/GPU supercomputer)
or even multiple platforms (combining clusters or working in a cloud). After the initial run,
the application is usually subject to a cycle of further optimizations (Optimization Step) and
executions (or repetitions of earlier steps as needed). Optimization in the context of this paper
refers to bolstering the scientific and technical quality of the application such that it becomes
suitable for use in production runs. This may involve fixing verification or validation issues
that arose during execution, rerunning the application multiple times to test the sensitivity of
key parameters, or to check the propagation of uncertainties in the model. Once the application
has been sufficiently optimized, researchers proceed with performing the main runs (Production
