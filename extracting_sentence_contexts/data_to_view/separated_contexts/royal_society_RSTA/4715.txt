A state w on A(M,J) is said to be Hadamard if the corresponding two-
point function W2) :C%°(M) x C%(M) + C defined by WO(E,f) =o(arpy(fOarp(f')) is a
distribution in Z'(M x M) with wavefront set

where V+/~ is the bundle of future/past-directed null covectors on M. The set of all Hadamard
states on A(M, J) will be denoted S(M, J). It would take us too far from our main purpose to give the definition of the wavefront set here
(see [15] for details) but the main points are that:

— the wavefront set WF(u) of a distribution u € Y’(X) on manifold X is a subset of
the cotangent bundle T*X encoding the singular structure of u—in particular smooth [=
distributions have empty wavefront sets; :3

— under pull-backs by smooth functions the wavefront set obeys 13

— in the QFT context, the wavefront set condition (3.3) on the two-point function is sufficient : 4
to fix the wavefront sets of all 1-point functions exactly (combining [16, Prop. 6.1] and DN
[17]) and also ensures that the two-point function differs from the ‘Hadamard parametrix’ [sz
by a smooth function [18]; and :B

— the form of the wavefront set condition recalls the fact that Minkowski two-point .
functions are positive frequency in the first variable and negative frequency in the
second.*

It is easily seen that S(M, J) is a state space for A(M, J). Now consider a morphism yw : (M, J) >
(M’, J’) and a Hadamard state w € S(M’, J’). Then the n-point functions of and &/(y)*w are
related by
