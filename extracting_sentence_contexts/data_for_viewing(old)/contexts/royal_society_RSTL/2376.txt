readily converted when diluted into alcohol and sulphuric acid, s0 it affords a
method of converting ether into alcohol: thus ether may be formed from alco-
hol, and alcohol from ether at pleasure, by throwing the hydro-carbon of these
bodies into that peculiar state which it assumes when combined with sulphuric
acid in sulphovinic acid. We may even proceed beyond this, and form either
alcohol or ether, using olefiant gas as the hydro-carbon base: for I have shown
in my last paper, that olefiant gas by combining with sulphuric acid, forms
sulphovinic acid, and the acid 80 produced forms either ether or alcohol, ac-
cording to circumstances which are under perfect command.

It can hardly be necessary to refer to the extraordinary remark at the end
of MM. Dumas and Bovutar's second paper, except to state that it is singu-
larly at variance with the facts and opinions given throughout the former part
of that and the preceding paper by the same authors. Those persons who read
both papers, and also those of Mr. Farapay and myself, which were pub-
lished long before the appearance of the former, will be able to decide without
further comment from whom the particular views contained in those papers
first emanated.
