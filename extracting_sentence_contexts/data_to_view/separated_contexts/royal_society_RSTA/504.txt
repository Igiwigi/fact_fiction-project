The initial magnetic field is unipolar with a mean unsigned field strength of 5 G in the corona. The convective motions build enough magnetic field stress to self-consistently maintain the hot
corona [6,7,10,15,140]. Note that the magnetic field is vertical in the corona (figure 1a), and
despite the fact that our simulations do not include imposed flux emergence, the dynamics in the
simulation and the convective motions accumulate horizontal magnetic field in the sub-adiabatic
photosphere. As mentioned above, this horizontal field will in principle be constrained to the
sub-adiabatic photosphere [85,86]. In addition, magnetic field footpoints will move around.
