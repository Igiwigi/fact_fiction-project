Tracing the thickness of the ventricular wall in an opposite direc-
Stion, 5. 6. from the base towards the upper part of the middle third, the same changes
Qpresent themselves, although in a less marked degree. Thus the extreme base consists
of two layers, the continuations in fact of those forming the second part of the apex;
the second portion of four, the third of six, and 80 on—an arrangement which accounts
for the yentricular wall being thicker towards the base than towards the apexf. Recapitulation of facts connected with the left ventricle (Mammal). Before leaving
the left ventricle, it may be well to recapitulate briefly the points more particularly
dwelt upon. They are the following :—

* This portion of the ventricular wall is formed by the external fibres turning round in a circular direction,
to alter their direction and become continuous with the internal, the external and internal fibres, in virtue of
their spiral direction, not crossing each other until removed an appreciable distance from the apex.

+ The septum also tapers in two directions, more particularly when, as in the present demonstration, it is
regarded as forming part of the left ventricle.
