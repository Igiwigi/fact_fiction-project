Secondly, the
extreme asymmetry peculiar to Flat-fishes, viz., that of the skull, is invariably
preceded by certain changes in the head and body. Hence the possibility of direct
causation may be concluded. A brief survey of the facts, having the adult structure
in mind as well as the development, will show how far this conclusion is justified and
pave the way for a constructive theory. The nature of the oblique growths or departures from the normal varies in the
ditferent regions. In the skull the changes are obviously due to pressure or stresses ;
apart from their tendency to grow, the structures are quite passive. â€˜The eye is not
pulled into its new position by the frontals or its own muscles; it is demonstrably
pushed over by the growth of the subocular ligament or the prefrontal.
