Possibly, then, the shells now found on its shore are the descen-
dants of those then admitted from the Mediterranean. Another opening was lately
made from the sea, but has been nearly closed, the small stream of water from the
sea mentioned above being due to this opening. At high Nile the level of the lake rises, owing to the infiltration of fresh water, and
probably it is brackish at this season, From these considerations aud from the many
vicissitudes that the lake has undergone, it is clear that nothing can be stated with
