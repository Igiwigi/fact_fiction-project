The available estimated costs were for at least one cat-
egory [2], so some species might be downlisted by more than
one IUCN category with the same expenditure. As a result, it
is possible that the ADEPD-cost scores of those species were
underestimated in this analysis. However, we consider it unli-
kely that the minimum funds necessary to downlist a species
once are in fact also sufficient to downlist it twice. The cohort of 206 species used in this study was selected
from the analysis of global financial efforts for bird conserva-
tion in reference [2]. Data for the initial cohort of 210 species
selected in this study, from which the wider conservation
costs for all bird species were estimated, were obtained through
sending questionnaires to experts on all threatened birds.
