we thereby assume that any portion of the path relative to the air has a length equal
to that of its projection on the vertical, or in symbols

sje wees. 4 sw we ts (10)

There remains, however, this distinction between s and h, that whereas h increases to a
maximum at the vertex and then decreases, s increases all the time. With the approximation (10) and the fact (4), the vertical dynamical equation (8)
becomes

Tt is seen that (11) is of the same form as it would be in still air, so that we may regard h
as already given by the solution of (11) which has been obtained in naturalized form in
$4.3 above. When / is known, s follows immediately from (10). And when s is regarded as independent of the relative velocities rx, ry, then the
dynamical equations (6) and (7) are linear in rx, ry as (1) and (2) were not.
