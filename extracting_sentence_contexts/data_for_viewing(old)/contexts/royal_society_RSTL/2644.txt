sulci on both hemispheres are more symmetrical than in the brain of the European.
It remains, however, to be proved whether this sxymmetry is to be found in all Negro
brains, which I very much doubt. The size and quantity of the brain of the Negro
varies as much as the European from that of the Orang-Outang. I measured the
capacity of the cayum cranii of a full-grown Asiatic Pongo, and found that it only
held 11 oz. 7 dr. The brain of this Pongo was therefore much smaller than is usual,
even in congenital idiotism.

Conclusions drawn from these Anatomical Researches.

1. The brain of a Negro is upon the whole quite as large as that of the European
and other human races. The weight of the brain, its dimensions, and the capacity
of the cayum cranii prove this fact. Many anatomists have also incorrectly asserted
that Europeans have a larger brain than Negroes.

IH. The nerves of the Negro, relatively to the size of the brain, are not thicker than
those of Europeans, as SOEMMERRING and his followers have said.

IH. The outward form of the spinal cord, the medulla oblongata, the cerebellum,
and cerebrum of the Negro, show no important difference from that of the European.

IV. Nor does the inward structure, the order of the cortical and medullary snb-
stance, nor the inward organization of the interior of the Negro brain show any dif-
ference from that of the European.
