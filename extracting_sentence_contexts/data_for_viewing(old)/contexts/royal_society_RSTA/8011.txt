of the Bureau International which were used as the basis of reference. The original
result of the Benoit-Fapry-Peror determination was given in terms of dry air, but
again has been corrected for changes in the accepted equations of the reference standards
employed. The adjusted values for these two determinations are those given by
GurtaumE.* The amount of carbon dioxide present in these cases is unknown and
can only be assumed as approximately equal to the normal proportion of 0-03%.

The original result of WaTanase and Imaizumi was given for dry air containing no
carbon dioxide and has been adjusted by — 0-0003 x 107° M, corresponding to the
introduction of the normal proportion of 0-03% of carbon dioxide. The same adjust-
ment has been made to the present result. In addition, a further small adjustment is

on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in

earlier results refer to the normal hydrogen scale. According to Hatt the indication
of the hydrogen thermometer at 15° C., taking the average value determined by different
observers, is approximately 0-001° C, in excess of the temperature on the thermo-

This corresponds to a change of — 0-009 x 107° M in the basis of
