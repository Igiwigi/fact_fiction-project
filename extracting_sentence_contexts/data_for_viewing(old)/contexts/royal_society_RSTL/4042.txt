2321. When plates of copper or bismuth, an inch in thickness, intervene between
the poles and the copper bar, the same results occur.

2322. If one magnetic pole only be employed the effects occur near it as well as
before, provided that pole have a face large in proportion to the bar, as the end
of the iron core (2246.) : but if the pole be pointed by the use of the conical termi-
nation, or if the bar be opposite the edge of the end of the core, then they become
greatly enfeebled or disappear. altogether; and only the general fact of repulsion .
remains (2295.).

2323. The peculiar effects which have just been described are perhaps more strikingly
shown if the bar of copper be suspended perpendicularly, and then hung opposite and
near to the large face of a single magnetic pole, or the pole being placed vertically,
as described (2246. 2263.), anywhere near to its side. The bar, it will be remem-
bered, is two inches in length by 0:33 of an inch in width, and 0:2 of an inch in thick-
ness, and as it now will revolve on an axis parallel to its length, the two smaller di-
mensions are those which are free to moye into new positions. In this case the
establishment of the magnetic force causes the bar to turn a little in accordance with
the effects before described, and the remoyal of the magnetic force causes a revulsion,
which sends the bar spinning round on its axis several times. But at any moment
