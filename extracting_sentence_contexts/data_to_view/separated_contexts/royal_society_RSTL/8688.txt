Bzven (104), 1849, spoke of racemose or acinous glands of the pylorus, which pass
into the acinous glands of the duodenum (BruNNER's glands). EckgR (105), 1852, said that the racemose glands of the portio pylorica form an
obvious transition to BRUNNER's glands. This fact was either overlooked or denied until

CoBELLI (106), 1864, found, in the pyloric end of the stomach of man, branched
mucous glands and acinous glands. ' The acinous glands are arranged in rows or little
heaps radiating from the pylorus.
