The electrometer was connected with the
metal sphere at about 17 hrs. 32 mins. and disconnected at 18 hrs. 35 mins. It is
important to notice that although the open-scale record given in fig. 11 agrees with the
portion marked LM in fig. 6 in the broad features, all the changes seen therein have not
been proportionately magnified. This is apparently due to the fact that, although an
exposed metal sphere picks up a certain fraction of the true potential, that fraction is

never definite. The fraction apparently depends on the state of the surrounding air
and also on the leakage of the insulating system. With good insulation the fraction
varies from 5 to 10 per cent.
