The formula in fact extends to negative or fractional values of the index n, and when 1

is a fraction, we must, as usual, in order to exhibit the formula in its proper generality,
write q+2mz instead of 9. In the particular case n=, it would be easy to show the
identity of the value of the 8quare root of the matrix with that before obtained by a
different process.
