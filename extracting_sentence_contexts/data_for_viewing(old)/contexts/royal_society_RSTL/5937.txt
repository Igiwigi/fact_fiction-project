In the course of his researches the author has accidentally fallen upon other species
of Lumbrici. more or less favourable to the study of this question. In L. Kanii, mihi,
in the young tate, the segmental organ may frequently be discovered in a condition
highly favourable to the present investigation (e fig. 4 A). In that annulus in which the
contained ciliated tubes are destined to become the generative organs, the latter appear
at first under the character represented at c (fig. 4 B). From one side of the mid-portion
of the tube (as at c, 4 C) may be observed to bulge minute pear-shaped vesicles, filled with
a semigelatinous fluid. Regarded as a whole, it is impossible to doubt that this organ is
one of the segmental organs. If this be admitted, the conclusion cannot be resisted, that
the vesicular outgrowth (c) is really the ovary or the testes in process of development.
But in the same individual the other and ordinary segmental organs have altogether a dif-
ferent form and structure (fig. 4 A. @ a, a, and B)> Thus is adduced another well-attested
fact, in confirmation of the view maintained in this paper, viz. that the reproductive
organs in Nais and Lambricus are in reality nothing but a modification of the © segmental
organs” or © ciliated tubes” which exist, in pairs, in every annulus of the body.

Parth-worm.—The anatomy of the reproductive system in the Earth-worm has been
made a subject of express investigation by many competent comparative anatomists.

The points in difference between the author and other observers will be indicated as
we proceed.

The anatomy of this system in the Earth-worm has ever been held as almost' an
insoluble enigma. No intelligible clue whereby to unravel the intricate glandular mass
has ever been discovered. Without such a clue the problem never can be consistently
