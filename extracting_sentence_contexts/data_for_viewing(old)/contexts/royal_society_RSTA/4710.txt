analogous properties of the optimal sets of general spectral functionals. Let us fix the natural
numbers 1 <i; <--- < ix. The following result was proved in [8] in the framework of (1.3).

Theorem 2.4. Let F:R‘ > R be locally Lipschitz continuous and increasing in each variable. The
following spectral optimization problem:

min{F(Aj,(Q),...,2,(2)) + [2]: 2 CR} (2.7)

has at least one solution. Moreover, every solution is a shape subsolution for the energy, for a suitable
constant c > 0.

Proof. We assume in a first instance the existence of a solution Q* for problem (2.7). We shall
prove this fact in a second step. For now, we justify that 2* is a shape subsolution for the
energy, so it inherits the regularity properties from theorem 2.2. Let 2 C Q* be a quasi-open set.


Following the notation from (2.2), we get
