In summary, ectotherms may

data from captive populations showing neoplasia in amphi- most endotherms—they are likely to have variation in
bians [18] and reptiles [19,20], and captive reptiles have somatic telomerase expression, and associated telomere

mammals. Similarly, cancer is widespread in fish, although ectotherms?
