We take the height of Botley Hill (890 feet) a'mean'of
900,885.88z, which the observations at Leith Hill, Banstead,
and Crowborough Beacon respectively produce,” by making
use of -- of the contained arcs for-refraction”:' this height ex=
ceeds that in General Roy's table by gt feet; but we are not
certain of its being nearer the truth.;, only it may be remarked,
in the table, p. 246 (Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXX.), that be-
tween the several stations from High Nook to Botley Hill, the
mean refractions are very great.

From the reciprocal observations at Leith Hill, Banstead,
and Shooter's Hill, the height of the last station is 446 feet,
which is the same, in fact, as that obtained in the following
manner. General Roy found by levelling, that the floor of
the upper story of the Bull Inn at Shooter's Hill was 444 feet
above the Gun Wharf at Woolwich ; and he allowed 22 feet
for the fall to low water at the sea ; the sum is 466 feet. In
1794, we levelled from the Inn to the Station, and found the
latter 21 feet lower than the floor, which taken from 466,
there remains 44, feet for the station's height.

Notwithstanding this consistency, and also that in the height
of St. Ann's Hill, found by difterent methods, it is evident from
the observations at Dunnose, Rook's Hill, and Butser Hill,
that relative heights deduced from elevations, or depressions,
