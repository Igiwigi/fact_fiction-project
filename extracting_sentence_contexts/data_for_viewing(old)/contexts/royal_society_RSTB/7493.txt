contraction of plain muscle in the edges of the septa. Available evidence shows that the
facts of lung growth in the rabbit can be fitted more easily into this scheme than into

the alternative scheme of alveolar budding supported by Bremer (1935). Whether or not the
desquamation of epithelium from the distal portion of the respiratory tree be accepted as
a fact (and strong evidence has been produced to show that this occurs in the foetus and
persists in the adult), epithelial growth cannot account for the quantitative facts of growth
of the lung lumen and its subdivision. Nor can it account for the fact that the structure of
a 5-day-old lung can be reproduced by simple inflation of one that has never breathed.

One further step can be taken. The number of septa is clearly a function of internal
surface area of the lung which is therefore a linear function of the rates of growth of lung
volume and interstitial volume. This relation expresses ‘the phenomenon. ..which is
visible throughout the whole field of morphology. ..the tendency (referable doubtless in
each case to some definite physical cause) for mere bodily surface to keep pace with volume,
through some alteration ofits form’. Illustrating this principle with cases of organs furnished
with complicated luminal subdivision, D’Arcy Thompson (1942) proceeds: ‘the vast in-
crease in respiratory surface in the air sacs and alveoli of the lung,...all these and more
are cases in which a more or less constant ratio tends to be maintained between mass and
surface, which ratio would have been more and more departed from with increasing size,
