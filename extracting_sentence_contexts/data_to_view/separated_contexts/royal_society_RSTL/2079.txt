decomposed by electricity, andthe
acid matter separated at the positive, and the alkaline matter
at the negative poles; and they asserted that in this way
muriate of lime might be decomposed ; and drew the conclu-
sion that nascent hydrogen was not, as had been generally
believed, the cause of the appearance of metals from metallic
s0lutions. These valuable observations ought to have: ex-
plained distinctly the source- of the appearance of acid and
alkaline substances at the two-extremities of the pile, yet the
Paper was never translated into English; nor at all attended
to; and one of their facts was contradicted by the assertion
of, generally, a very accurate observer, Mr. CRvicKsHANK,
who in his early experiments mentioned that he had not been
able to decompose' muriate of lime in the circuit,

In 1805 various statements were made, both in Italy and
England, respecting the generation of muriatic acid and fixed
alkali from pure water. The fact was asserted by MM. Pac-
CH1ONI and PEELE, and denied by Dr. WoLLasTon, M. Biot,
and the Galvanic Society at Paris,* Mr. SyLvzsTER, who
