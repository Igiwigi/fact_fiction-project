S constitutes more than half its weight), and the highest specific gravity. In No. 5,

S than that of the AgT, which constitutes nearly three-fourths of its weight.
3 (2) We may note that the fusing points diminish from 1 to 3, and increase from 8
5 Bt 5; while the specific gravities diminish on both sides of No. 3.

Z change of state at 142? C., and finishes it at 156*5 C. (mainly, however, between 148*

18? C. lower, and finish at 133? C., or 23*:5 C. lower. The lead-silver iodide (p. 1149)

S (4) Ib is a curious fact that until the percentage of iodide of silver in the compounds
S becomes considerable, its chief influence is exerted between a narrow range of tempe-
