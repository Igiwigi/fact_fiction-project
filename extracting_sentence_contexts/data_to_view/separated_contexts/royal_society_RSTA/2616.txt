Water droplets placed on
pristine silicone-oil-infused surfaces are eventually coated with the silicone oil; in contrast, water
droplets spread on the plasma-treated oil remained uncoated, due to the increase of the specific
energy of the silicon oil induced by the plasma treatment, followed by a consequent change in the
spreading parameter (see equation (5.1) and [63]).

8. Applications of lubricant-impregnated micro-rough surfaces

Lubricant-impregnated surfaces demonstrate the potential for a diversity of industrial
applications. They are obviously attractive for manufacturing omniphobic surface due to the fact
that they do not suffer from Cassie-Wenzel wetting transitions [31,49,54,64]. It was suggested
that lubricant-infused surfaces are promising candidates for manufacturing anti-icing surfaces
[27,65,66]. However, it was shown that the process of freezing and frost formation on lubricant-
impregnated surfaces is accompanied by the migration of the lubricant from the wetting ridge
and from within the textured substrate to the surface of frozen droplets [67].
