In the
whitest parts, which in the FeCl, etch are the most copper-rich, the 8 crystallisation
has taken place. The bars, which are really sections of plates, have definite
crystalline shape, and present many good examples of twinning. As Mr. FraRnstpEs
has pointed out to us, it resembles the twinning seen in soda felspars, but the fact
that the bars darken at different rates when heat-oxidised, is some indication that
they are not merely twins in a homogeneous substance. Sn 21. Slow-cooled chill at 570Â° (not reproduced).
