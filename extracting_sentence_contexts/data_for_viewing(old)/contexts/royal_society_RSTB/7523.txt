F. J. RICHARDS. ON PHYLLOTAXIS 533

similar, the sole difference residing in the numbers of leaves occurring at the nodes, one in
the alternate, two in the opposite decussate, x in alternating whorls of x. Hence in the
opposite decussate arrangement we are dealing simply with a bijugate version of the alternate
system, and in alternating whorls of x with an x-jugate version of the same system. If the
relation between parastichy intersection angle and phyllotaxis index is known for alternate
phyllotaxis it may be immediately obtained for these other arrangements by adding the
appropriate constants. Such constants have already been determined in the consideration
of multijugate Fibonacci systems, and the same corrections are applicable here. That this
is so may readily be appreciated from the fact that a plane centric diagram of an opposite
decussate arrangement could be bisected along any diameter, and either half rolled into
a 60° cone displaying an alternate arrangement having the same parastichy intersection
angle; similarly with a plane diagram of any system of alternating whorls.

In the alternate system only two parastichies wind round the apex, and these in opposite
directions, each passing through every primordium; the system may thus be designated 1:1.
Starting from relations (1) and (2) on p. 517

it is seen that in this system a=b=1; ¥,=y~,=7 radians; and «,=«,=one-half the inter-
section angle of the two parastichies. Therefore
