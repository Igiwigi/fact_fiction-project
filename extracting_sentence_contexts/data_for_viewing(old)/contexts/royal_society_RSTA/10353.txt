The relative numbers of atoms of P, Q, R existing at any time are shown graphically
in fig. 9, curves A, B, and C respectively. The number of atoms R, is taken as 100 for
comparison, and values of \,, Ay, Ay are taken corresponding to the 3, 21, and 28-
minute changes in the active deposit of radium. A comparison with fig, 8 for a short
exposure brings out very clearly the variation in the relative amounts of P, Q, R in
the two cases. The amount of R initially decreases very slowly. This is due to the
fact that the‘supply of C due to breaking up of B at first, nearly compensates for
the breaking up of C. The values of Q and R after several hours decrease
exponentially, reaching half value every 28 minutes.
