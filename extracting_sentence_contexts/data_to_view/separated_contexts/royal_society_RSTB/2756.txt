Spore-producing cells form a part of the tissue of all sporophytes which complete
their part in the normal ontogenetic cycle; from this it is concluded that spore-
production was normally a constant event in their evolution.

(2). There is a general biological probability of increase of spore-production in
homosporous, land-living plants, since those with the largest spore-output are most
likely to maintain and spread their race, while the numerical question is not
complicated by the sexuality of the spores. As a matter of fact the number of cell-
divisions in the sporogenous tissue preceding the tetrad division is usually indefinite
in homosporous forms ; the capacity of increase is thus structurally evident in them.

(3). The Archegoniate sporophytes illustrate by numerous examples the sterilisation
of spore-producing cells, so as to form temporary nutritive cells, or permanent
