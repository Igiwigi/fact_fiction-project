AN INVISCID LIQUID BETWEEN PARALLEL PLANES 65

TuHeorEM VI—When the steady motion u = u, (9), v = 0, between the fixed planes y = + 6,
is slightly disturbed, and the vorticity of the disturbance is expressed in the form (6.13), the
functions F, (x, t), G, (x, t) satisfy the infinite system of integro-differential equations (6.19),
(6.20), which reduce to (6.22) if'u, is an odd function of and to (6.24) if u, is an even
function of ». If uy is an even function of y and tf the vorticity of the disturbance is initially
an even function of ), it remains an even function of y, whereas, if it is initially an odd function
of 7, tt remains an odd function of » ; provided always that the disturbance remains small.

The fact thatif u, (9) isevenin » and o’ (x,y, 0) is odd in_y, then w’ (x,y, ¢) is odd
in ), is of course obvious, since these initial conditions correspond to a motion
initially symmetrical with respect to the x-axis, and hence permanently symmetrical.
The other result, where uw (y) is even in y and o’ (x,y, 0) is even in_y, is unexpected.
The significance of even and odd vorticities is illustrated in fig. 1.
