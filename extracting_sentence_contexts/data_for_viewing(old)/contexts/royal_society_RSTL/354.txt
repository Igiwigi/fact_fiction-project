is in her full state with eggs: he is considerably thicker than
either, but not longer in the same proportfon : he does not
terminate at the anus in so sharp a point ; and the opening
between the two last scales of the back and belly is larger, and
more under the belly, than in the female. His proboscis is
much shorter than that of the labouring bee, which makes me
suspect he does not collect his own honey, but takes that which
is brought home by the others ; especially as we never find
the males abroad on flowers, &c. only flying about the hives
in hot weather, as if taking an airing; and when we find that
the male of the humble bee, which collects its own food, has as
long a proboscis, or tongue, as the female, I think it is from all
these facts reasonable to suppose, the male of the common bee
feeds at home. He has no sting.

The males, I believe, are later in being bred than the la-
bouring bee. As they are only produced to go off with a
hive, they are not $0 early brought forth ; for in the month
of April I killed a hive, in which I found maggots and
chrysalises, but did not find any males among the latter :
the maggots are too young for such investigation ; but about
the 2oth of May we observed males: they are all very
much of the same size. In the month of August, probably
about the latter end, we may suppose they impregnate the
queen for the next year, and about the latter end of the same
