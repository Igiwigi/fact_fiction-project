To continue the progress, the DEMO design needs to migrate from the present pre-
conceptual design to a conceptual design by 2020. This will happen after a thorough Gate Review
around 2020 in which a number of less promising design options will be deselected. On the critical
path for DEMO—and in fact for any fusion reactor—is the construction of a 14MeV neutron
source. Ideally, the start of the DONES construction should take place early in the 2020s. DEMO
operation is expected to start in the 2050s.
