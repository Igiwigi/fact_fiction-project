The difficulty of finding formule to
accurately represent any particular D-series would point to the latter supposition,
a supposition also which is strengthened when we study comparatively the series of
numerical values of the denominators found directly from observations as is done
below. In the case of the alkalies the formulz given in [I.] (as well as those in 1/m*)
do not reproduce well the high orders and are probably only within the limits of error
because the lines are so diffuse that the observation errors are very large. In fact
one of the few excessive deviations found in [I.] was that of NaD (6), in which it is
