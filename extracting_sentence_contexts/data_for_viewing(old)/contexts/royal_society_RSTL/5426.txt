MR. POWER ON THE ABSORPTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS, ETC. 33

we ee therefore in general why particular rays should be selected for absorption, with-
out any insensible gradation, and why some lines of absorption, those corresponding
to nnizon for example, should be more strongly marked than others ; and these pre-
liminaries being conceived, then comes the equation

Sin 0=(1+9)£ sin 0,

which explains how those rays which undergo absorption are turned out of their places
and deflected towards the less refracted end of the spectrum, and in some cases,
though with intensities 80 diminished as to be imperceptible, far beyond the limits of
the visible spectrum. In fact as s increases, the above equation shows that 0, increases.
'Phe refracted ray is therefore turned more from the normal, or deviates less from its
original course than it would do if there were no absorption, in which case $=1).
"The intensities of the reflected and refracted rays, both in the primary and secondary
planes, will of course be diminished by the loss of vis viva, as is further apparent from
the expressions which have been obtained for ?', 4, ;' and j, in Nos. 24 and 25, namely,
