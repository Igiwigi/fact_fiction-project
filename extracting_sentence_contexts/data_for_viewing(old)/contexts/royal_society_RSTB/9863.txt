believed to be involved in kin- or nest-mate recognition
in social insects is the cuticular hydrocarbon profile, the
complex mixture of lipids found on the insect cuticle. However,
differences between individuals within the same social
group can be blurred through transfer of odours during
allogrooming and other physical contact. The resulting
gestalt odour, common to all colony members, facilitates
recognition of non-nest-mates but reduces the potential for
within-nest kin recognition [29]. This constraint could mean
that foundresses are unable to detect when they are unrelated
to the dominant, and so cannot adjust their behaviour adap-
tively. However, less closely related pairs of P. dominula
cofoundresses do in fact have less similar hydrocarbon profiles,
suggesting that hydrocarbon cues contain useful information
even within colonies [25,30]. But relatedness itself is a better pre-
dictor of behaviour than hydrocarbon differences [25]. This
suggests either that wasps do not use hydrocarbon cues, or
that specific components, rather than the overall hydrocarbon
profile that has been measured to date, are the cues involved
in recognition [31].

Even if odour-mixing makes it difficult for nest-mates to
assess individual relatedness, one might expect wasps that are
not yet part of a group to retain informative cues that could
be used to avoid joining non-relatives. The indirect fitness
