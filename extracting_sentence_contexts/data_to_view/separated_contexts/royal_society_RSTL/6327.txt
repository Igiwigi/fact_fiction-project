ON THE FORMATION OF THE EGG IN THE ANNULOSA. 617

intermediate condition,
T1 am only too well aware that my obseryations have not yet gone far enough to justify
any definite conclusions, but they seem to indicate that the eggs of Chetlifer* are in
er carried about by the animal, that the young ones in this position grow to 80me
$ize, being nourished by a milky fluid secreted for that purpose by a special organ, but
that, when winter comes on, the eggs are laid by the mother in some secure place, and
erhaps do not hatch until the warm days of spring. Furthermore, the fact that each
female Chetifer produces thirty-five to forty eggs in a brood, while the egg-bearing
imens have only seventeen or eighteen eggs attached to them, and that while these

the last sixteen specimens which I examined, eight were males, and eight were females.
