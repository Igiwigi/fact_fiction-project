where the rise and fall of the surfaces nearly vanishes.

19. I shall now proceed to give such materials for a knowledge of the tides of the
Pacific as I have been able to collect, in addition to those which I had under my
notice in my former Es8ay. They are for the most part derived from tide observa-
tions made under the direction of naval officers employed on expeditions of survey
and discovery. The series of observations at each place was often necessarily brief
and inexact.; and therefore it is no reflection upon the kill and care of the officers
and men to whom we owe them, to say that they are often wanting in correctness.

20. There are, moreover, two other sources of inaccuracy in tide observations ;
namely, the want of a clear understanding as to the thing to be observed, and the
irregularity or complexity of the facts themselves. With regard to the former point,
I hope that several misapprehensions formerly prevalent among navigators are now

no longer common, 8uch as confounding the time of high water with the time of
turn of the tide-stream. But there is probably till s0me unnecessary difficulty pro-
duced by regarding, as a cardinal point in the observation, the © estahlishment,” as
vulgarly understood, namely the hour of high water on the day of new or full moon ;
for, in fact, the hour of high water on this day is of no more importance than the
