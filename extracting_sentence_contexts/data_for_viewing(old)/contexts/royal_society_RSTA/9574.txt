corresponding to the formula (80), i = ip?+k/V. It has already been mentioned that a dynamometer
form of instrument will, if at the same time sufficiently accurate, prove to be more suitable for the
measurement of current in that the scale-readings will be more open at high velocities; the same result
could also be achieved by suitably shaping the pole-pieces of the permanent magnet of a direct-current

instrument and in the event of being able to employ standardized anemometer-wires, the scale of the
ammeter could be graduated to read velocities directly.

The galvanometer employed was a Weston portable instrument with jewel bearings and capable of
detecting a current of about 10-Â° amperes. This degree of sensitivity is more than necessary ; in fact
a millivoltmeter was found to be sufficiently sensitive for most purposes. The constants of damping are
very important in determining the rapidity with which observations can be made, and it was found that
equally sensitive galvanometers varied within wide limits in this respect. By employing an alternating
current and a telephone receiver instead of a galvanometer it was found that the same calibration curve
was obtained as in the case of direct current measurements.

It was found possible to test for any suspected change in the constants of the anemometer-wire by
measuring the current required to bring the wire to the standard temperature in a stagnant atmosphere,
care being taken to protect the instrument from draughts.

In analysing a complicated distribution of air-flow, the direction of the current of air may be determined
from the effect discussed in Section 14; if the anemometer is rotated about an axis perpendicular to the
