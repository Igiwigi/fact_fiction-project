these two kinds of plants, so far as the leaves are concerned, are chiefly as follows :--

The more shaded plants have much larger leaves with much longer petioles : the
laminz are undoubtedly softer in texture, and brighter green in colour, the smaller
tougher leaves of the plants in the open being of a dark and glossy green, especially
above. These differences correspond to differences in minute structure: the shaded
leaves have shorter, looser, palissade cells, and more intercellular spaces between them
and in the large loose spongy parenchyma. Moreover, the stomata on the upper
surface appear to be more numerous: on the lower surface the stomata seem to be
larger, but I cannot say they are more numerous. The stomata have wider
openings in the damp shaded plants, and the cell walls of all the parts are thinner
and more watery; of course it may be assumed that there is more aqueous vapour in
the intercellular spaces, ‘Taking all these facts into consideration, I see no difficulty
in explaining the differences in the times occupied in infections; and they also throw

light on the vexed question which has arisen around the unfortunate word “ pre-
disposition.”

The plants in the ditch were certainly more apt to be diseased than others in the
open, because the disease, once established, could spread like an epidemic under the
conditions existing. I have other facts in other connections which bear out this, and
I hope some time to be able to devote special and continuous attention to this
