As will be described in detail, it was found that the male starlings do not breed until
their second year of life, whereas the female starlings breed in their first year. In Holland,
Kluijver (1935) has noted that the majority of males breed for the first time in their second
year and the majority of females in their first year, and in Latvia, Vilks & Transehe (1933)
have also recorded a female breeding in its first year. These facts are interesting in view of
the great preponderance of males over females in the starling population, a preponderance
which not infrequently leads to polyandry (Grabham 1895 ; Newstead 1908). Of the 786 birds
shot in the course of this enquiry, 559, or 71-1 %, were males. This proportion agrees closely
with that given for the starling in the United States of America by Hicks (1934), who found
that out of a total of 3161 birds, 2148, or 67-9Â°%, were males.
