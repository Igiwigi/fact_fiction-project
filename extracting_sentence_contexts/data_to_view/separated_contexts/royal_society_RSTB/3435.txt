It is
sometimes remarked that fossil plants are characterised by the large size of their cells ;
but when we examine leaf structure we find that most of the cells and vessels are
smaller than those in modern leaves. It seems rather curious that we have not yet been able to recognise Annularian
leaves in petrified material. I believe that this may be due to the fact they had an
entirely different structure from the leaves of the Calamocladus group. Tue Functions or THE MELASMATIC TISSUE.

_ From the foregoing description it will be seen that a very definite and easily
distinguishable group of cells, which, following Hick, I have called the melasmatic
tissue, is present in all the leaves studied.
