CAYLEY ON THE THEORY OF MATRICES.

34. Two matrices L, M are skew convertible when LM=—ML; this is a relation
much less important than ordinary convertibility, for it s to be noticed that we cannot
in general find a matrix L skew convertible with a given matrix M. In fact, _
sidering M as given, the equality affords a set of linear equations between the coeffi-
cients of L equal in number to these coefficients ; and in this case the bs are
independent, and we may eliminate all the coefficients of L, and wo thus arrive at a
relation which must be satisfied by the coefficients of the given matrix M. Thus, sup-

and the conditions of skew convertibility are

V(a+d)+0(4'+d')=0
e(a+d)+(4+d)=0
