Seminal fluids may enhance sperm movement and viabi-
lity, protect paternity or impede rival ejaculates [14]. However, using vasectomized (i.e. SSK secretions only, no
sperm) sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), Olsson et al. [26] showed
that seminal fluid itself does not reduce rival malesâ€™ pater-
nity; in fact, females first mated to a vasectomized male
had higher fertility. In the only study to test for effects of rep-
tilian seminal fluid on sperm motility or velocity, Cuellar et al.
[47] demonstrated that anole lizard seminal fluid sustains
and activates sperm. Accessory gland proteins like those in
Drosophila [48] have not been described in squamates.
