offset of transcriptions were time-aligned with speech. Time to
name an odour (in ms) was measured from when the Sniffin’
Stick was closest to the nose to when the participant began to
speak. Ideally exact sniff measurements would have been taken

Further confirming the qualitative differences between Jahai
and Dutch verbal responses, we found that Jahai speakers
gave a single abstract term the majority of the time, and as

but this was not practical in the field, and more critically would such the average length of their response was much shorter
have disrupted facial expression coding. Separately, a trained than Dutch responses. Prior research has established that
FACS coder (Facial Action Coding System [33]) annotated the orthographic length correlates highly with phonetic length,
non-verbal facial responses to each odour. For the current purposes, even for languages with irregular spelling [36]; as such we
we focus on facial muscle movements (action units, AU), previously took orthographic length as a proxy for speech length. Argu-

which were recurrent in the dataset (table 1). Our focus was on
the first appraisals, and so only those AUs that began within 2 s of
the Sniffin’ Stick being held to the nose were coded.

Once transcribed and coded, data were extracted from

comparable to the Jahai orthography [37], would result in
somewhat shorter estimates than those measured here, but
