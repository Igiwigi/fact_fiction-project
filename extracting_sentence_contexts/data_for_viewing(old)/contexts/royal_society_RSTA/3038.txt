5. Implications for humans

The new theory offers some support for our subjective notions about time. In particular, although
not evident from the coarse-grained approximation given in equation (3.7), the conditional
state |Yy(to,o,A))t represents the galaxy in coordinate time t as being spread over a small
interval around f = +tc. In fact, a more accurate expression for |Yy(to,,A))t is a superposition
of two Gaussian-distributed kets centred on the times t= +t, and each one with a variance in
time of

where 4 and @ are given by equations (3.5) and (3.10), respectively [10]. The fact that the galaxy
is represented by |Yn(to,0,A))t as localized in time is a sufficient objective basis to support the : 2
subjective perception of existing at a ‘present’ moment at time te. Moreover, in the previous : >
section we found that each conditional state | Yy(to, 0, 4)), contains, in general, physical evidence :3
of time evolution prior to f¢, and this provides an objective basis for contemplative human a
observers within the galaxy to perceive recalling the ‘past’. In other words, whenever the galaxy : <
exists as represented by |Yy(to, 0, A))t, contemplative human observers could perceive the present a
moment and recall the past. As the conditional state |Y\(to,0,))t represents the galaxy existing : S
only for a small duration around f;, the subjective perception of the present moment and recalling D8
the past is likewise confined to the same region of time. However, as all elements of Yj,,¢,,, have : S
equal physical status, if one element has this representation, then they all do equally! The only aos

option, then, is for the set Vj.,5,, to be an objective basis for humans to perceive the present
