crowded with young “ primitive discs,” similar to that whose empty chambers occupy

the centre of the parent shell (figs. 50 and 51).

The young are disposed in the brood chambers in the same way as in the micro-
spheric forms from Tonga and Fiji, above described, except that, owing to the
thinness of the margin of the disc, as compared with these specimens, the young in
each annulus are in a single row. I have failed to recognise a nucleus in the young
&m, probably owing to the imperfect preservation. The specimens containing young
fglong to a batch collected in the month of November.

“eWe are here then brought face to face with the fact that in this species megalo-
eric young are produced by megalospheric parents, while it is no less certain that
Fijian specimens, as described by Brady, and in Tongan specimens, as I have

town), megalospheric young are produced by microspheric parents. ‘The relation of

the two forms to one another will be discussed at the end of this paper.*
