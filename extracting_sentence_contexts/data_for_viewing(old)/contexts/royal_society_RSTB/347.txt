than normal, has nevertheless a considerably lower percentage of salts than IX.,
which is secreted at a rapid rate.

We may consider here one or two other results bearing on this question. In
Experiment 7 (X. to XII.), increasing the quantity of pilocarpin given, increases the
rate of secretion of organic substance very much more than it increases the rate
of secretion of water or of salts. When a fairly large dose of pilocarpin is given
at the beginning of an experiment, a rapid secretion of saliva takes place and the
percentage of organic substance in it is high. Subsequent doses produce a less
and less rapid secretion of saliva; so that, although the percentage of organic sub-
stance remains high, the rate of secretion of organic substance much diminishes. At
the same time, there is a great decrease in the irritability of the chorda tympani,
shown by the fact that electrical stimulation of the chorda tympani has very little

effect. It follows from this, since there is good ground for supposing that pilocarpin
causes a secretion by stimulating the endings of the chorda tympani, that pilocarpin
also is unable to stimulate strongly the gland. The high percentage of organic
substance, then, in the saliva secreted slowly after repeated doses of pilocarpin must
