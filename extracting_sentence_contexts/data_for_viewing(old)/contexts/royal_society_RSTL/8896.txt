between the incision and the lithocyst, there must have been a line of discharge of
sufficient size to conyey the influence of the lithocyst to the entire gonocalyx. Yet

upon staining this small portion of tissne with chloride of gold, I was unable to perceive
any structural peculiarity that might be supposed to correspond with the functional
peculiarity which it had previously exhibited.

(4) T have now to detail another fact of a very puzzling nature, but one which is
certainly of great importance in its bearing upon the subject of the present section.
When the spiral section is performed on Aurelia aurita, and when, as a consequence,
the contractile waves which traverse the elongating strip become at some point suddenly
blocked, if the section be stopped at this point it not unfrequently happens that after
a time the blocking suddenly ceases, the contractile waves again passing from the
strip into the gonocalyx as freely as they did before the section reached the point at
which the blocking occurred. The time required for this restoration of physiological
continuity is very variable, the limits being from a few seconds to an hour or more.
Usually, however, the time required is from two to four minutes. This process of
reestablishing the physiological connexions, although rapid, is not s0 instantaneous as is
that of their destruction by section. In general it requires the passage of several con-
tractile waves before the barrier to the passage of succeeding waves is completely thrown
