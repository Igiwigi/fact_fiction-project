described under the name Protothamnopteris baldaufi,t although the structure is not
sufficiently known to show how far the comparison holds good.

(ii) The Leaf.—The leaves must have been of great length and stood almost erect,
for the petiole bases are very nearly parallel to the stem, and the leaf-traces diverge
only very gradually from the stem stele. As figs. 3, 5, 6 show, the structure of the
petiole and of the fully formed leaf-trace is very similar to that in “ C.” australis. The
cortex is in three zones. The inner cortex is usually crushed and appears to have been
composed of a delicate tissue. The middle zone of large thin-walled cells grades into
the smaller-celled, almost sclerenchymatous tissue forming a sheath to the petiole.
There appears to be no well-marked epidermal layer. No emergences have been seen,
but this may be due to the preservation ; or they may have fallen off from the basal
parts of the rachis. Neither stomata nor lenticels have been observed ; in fact, the
cortex appears to have been devoid of intercellular spaces.

The cross-section of the fully formed petiolar strand has roughly the same shape as in
C. antiqua and “ C.” australis, but the “‘ waist’ is more constricted and the ends are
rather more swollen, so that the form is more dumb-bell-like, at least in a few of the

+ Beck (1920), Plate 2, fig. 5. Prof. Hirmmr (1927), p. 538, has transferred the species to the genus
Grammatopteris, a step which seems to be justified by the structure of the leaf-trace. I am deeply
indebted to Prof. Dr. Schumacher, of the Bergakademie in Freiberg i.S., for a loan of the type specimen,
which I hope to describe more fully at a later date. ,
