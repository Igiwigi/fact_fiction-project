The injury caused by the Dendryphiwm has now assumed the proportions of an
epidemic in the cucumber houses of this particular market gardener, but is not
recorded under such circumstances from elsewhere. Now Dendryphium comosum is
a well-known saprophyte, growing on decaying vegetable matter, but its occurrence
as a parasite has never before been recorded. A careful examination as to the origin of the outbreak of the epidemic caused by
Dendryphium revealed the fact that the young cucumber plants were growing in a
mixture of two thirds loam and one-third of stable manure. Further, the portions
of half-decomposed straw from the manure that projected above the surface of the
soil, were covered with a copious growth of Dendryphium. The fungus had been
introduced with the manure.
