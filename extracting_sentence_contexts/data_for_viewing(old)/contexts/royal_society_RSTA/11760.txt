experienced by a unit of positive electricity in motion at the same speed.as the vest of
the system. This mechanical force experienced by the unit charge consists not only
of the part due to the existence of electric force in the field, but also of a part due-to
the fact that the moving unit charge is acted on like a current element by the magnetic
induction,

Mathematical Abbreviations.

2. Certain mathematical forms occur so frequently in the theory of electro-
magnetism that it is convenient to have some compact method of indicating them.
The following are the abbreviations which will be employed in this essay.

(1.) The vector quantity whose components are A, Ag, As, will be written A/in
‘clarendon type, while its magnitude without regard to direction will be denoted by A.

(2.) The scalar quantity AB cos = A,B, + A,B, + A;B;, where @ is the angle
