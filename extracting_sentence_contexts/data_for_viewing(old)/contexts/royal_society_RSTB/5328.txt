|? distal end of the prong a triradiate is formed in a plane parallel to that of the plate.
| Many similar prongs are formed around the periphery of the plate and in course of
time the branches from these meet to form a much more open meshwork overlying
the compact plate.

THe DeVELOPMENT OF THE SKELETON IN Leplasterias AND IN Asterias CONTRASTED.

The development of the skeleton of Leptasterias is essentially similar to that of
Asterias, especially as regards the order in which the plates appear. The differences
are mostly in keeping with the fact that in the latter genus there is a long free-swimming
Ss larval period, whereas in the former the ova are yolky and the larval development
iB is greatly modified. The chief differences are as follows :â€”

| (a) In Asterias the plates are large and very openly meshed in the imago; in
iy Leptasterias the plates are of small size and very compact.

(b) In Asterias there is a marked tendency for the plates to crowd together and even
to overlap in the imago ; in Leplasterias the plates are quite separate from each
other as a rule.

(c) The spines of Leptasterias are much more solid than those of Asterias.
