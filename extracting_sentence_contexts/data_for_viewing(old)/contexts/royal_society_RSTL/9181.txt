because we have seen that at least one element essential to the mechanism whereby
reflex action is effected—the element, namely, of a definite localized ganglion—is here
absent. The next question, therefore, which arises is, as to whether the other elements
which are usually considered essential to the performance of reflex action are likewise
absent—the elements, namely, of afferent and efferent nerves. Now I felt 80 persnaded
of the difficulty of answering this question by means of histological research, that
hitherto I have postponed the latter, and, giving priority to the method of section,
I obtained the most definite results with regard to function which it is possible for this
or for any other method to yield.

(5) Bearing in mind that in an unmutilated Tiaropsis indicans the polypite invariably
localizes with the utmost precision any minute point of irritation situated in the bell,
the significance of the following fact is unmistakable, viz. that when a cut is intro-
duced between the base of the polypite and the point of irritation in the bell, the
localizing power of the former as regards that point in the latter is wholly destroyed,
For instance, if such a cut as that represented at « (see Plate 30. fig. 1) be made in
the nectocalyx of this Medusa, the polypite will no longer be able to localize the seat of a
stimulus applied below that cut, as, for instance, at 6. Now, having tried this experi-
ment a number of times and having always obtained the same result, I conclude that
the nervous connexions between the bell and the polypite which render possible the
localizing action of the latter, are connexions the functions of which are intensely
Specialized, and the distribution of which is radial.

(c) So far, then, we have highly satisfactory evidence of tissue tracts performing the
function of afferent nerves. But another point of great interest arises. Although in
