yiz. the numerator is «—2&*+1, =—3?, and the denominator is (—«)*, =e?.
So 1=5, the formula is

at—1 of—1\* __  (af—1)f__-.
(3-553) =5, that is ES hs -

In fact, n=3, this is

or
5-422 +66 —4a+1__.

viz. this is 5(L+&-+2%))—(1—412—4%+%+6%*)=0, which is right; and s0 in other
cages.
We thus have

which, on putting therein u=0, that is q=0, gives, as it should do, 5-=(—)\*-n,
