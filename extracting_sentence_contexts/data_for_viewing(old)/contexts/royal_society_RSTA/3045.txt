nevertheless appear that it selects a very special class of eligible states. It is solely because we
perceive classical phenomena continuously, and for free, that classical ontology has historically
won over other ontologies and lies at the root of our deepest intuitions on the nature of physical


reality. In what follows, we extend our ontology of states beyond such classical intuitions. For
now, we use the notion of non-contextuality to add precision to our definition of context:
Postulate 0. Contexts

By definition, contexts are characterized by non-contextual states.

The Postulate 0 allows a more precise characterization of the protocol used above to build an
ID card and define states. As a matter of fact, before being used as a context, this entity must
have primarily played the role of a system, and been systematically tested by other contexts. The
corresponding ID card must fulfil Condition 1. Eventually, the probed entity used as a context
is characterized by its own state, which does neither depend on some other context it would be
embedded in, nor on the system it may possibly contain. Postulating the non-contextuality of
the context allows breaking the recursive character of our construction, providing the necessary
fixed point to build a general ontology of states. It also eliminates per se the paradox of Wignerâ€™s
friend and related problems, because the state of a context defined that way is objective, and : =
consequently, identical for any observer. 38

Now that contexts have a well-defined state, it is possible to provide a more precise description [=
