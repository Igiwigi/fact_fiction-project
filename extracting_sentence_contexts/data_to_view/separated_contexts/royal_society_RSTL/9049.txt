The rate of transmission of tentacular waves is only one
half that of contractile waves, viz. 9 inches a second. This fact appeared to me very
remarkable, in view of the consideration that the tentacular wave is the optical expres-
Sion of a stimulus-wave, and that there can be no conceivable nse in a stimulus-
wave being able to pass through contractile tissue independently of a contractile
wave, unless the former is able to travel more rapidly than the latter ; for the only
conceivable use of the stimulus-wave is to establish physiological harmony between
different parts of the organism ; and if this wave cannot travel more rapidly than a
contractile wave which starts from the same point, it would clearly fail to perform this
function. In view of this anomaly I was led to think that if the rate of the stimulus-wave
is dependent in a large degree on the strength of the stimulus that starts it, the slow
rate of 9 inches a second might be more than doubled, if, instead of using a stimulus
80 gentle as not to start a contractile wave, I used a stimulus sufficiently strong to do
this. Accordingly I chose a specimen of Aurelia wherein the occurrence of tentacular
waves was yery conspicuous, and found, as I had hoped, that every time I stimulated
too gently to start a contractile wave, the tentacular wave travelled only at the rate of

9 inches a second, whereas if I stimulated with greater intensity I could always observe
the tentacular wave coursing an inch or two in front of the contractile wave.
