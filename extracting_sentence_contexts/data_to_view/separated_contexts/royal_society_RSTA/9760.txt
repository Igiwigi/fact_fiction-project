These
have been only ‘quite recently added to by Pascuen* and by the remarkable
extension of the Sodium Principal series up to 48 terms by Woop.t A most
valuable feature of Kayser’s work was the publication of possible errors of obser-
vation. This has rendered it possible to test with certainty whether any relation
suggesting itself is true within limits of observational error or not. In fact, without
this, the investigation, of which the present communication forms a first part, could
not have been carried out. So far as the author knows, SAUNDERS is the only other
observer who has accompanied his observations with estimates of this kind. Others
have given probable errors—practically estimates of the exactness with which they
can repeat readings of that feature of a line which they take to be the centre—an
estimate of little value for the present purpose.
