* Tf we reflect that the earth is encompassed by a mass of air,
equivalent in weight to a layer of mercury of 30 inches, we may inquire whether such a mass of magnetic gas,
continually agitated and submitted to the regular and irregular variations of pressure and temperature, does not
intervene in some of the phenomena dependent on terrestrial magnetizm. If we calculate in fact what is the
magnetic force of this fluid mass, we find that it is equivalent to an immense plate of iron, of a thickness a little
more than {;th of a millimetre of diameter (?), and which covers the whole surface of the globe.‚Äù This passage
