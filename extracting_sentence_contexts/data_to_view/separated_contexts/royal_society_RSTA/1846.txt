For reference, astronomers will not bet against
statements rated ‘certain’ even at million-to-one odds, whereas statements with low confidence
will find more than half of all astronomers believing that alternatives are more likely. We highlight
the best evidence for our current understanding of nucleosynthesis rather than providing a
comprehensive view of this vast subject.

2. Stars fuse nuclei to make new elements

Confidence: Certain

A century ago, Eddington suggested that the Sun’s power arises in the nuclear fusion of hydrogen
into helium, based on two facts. First, four protons have more mass than a 4He nucleus, so
helium production liberates the lost rest mass energy Amc”. Second, the temperature in the centre
of the Sun must be enormous to provide thermal pressure to keep the Sun from collapsing
under its own weight [3,4].
