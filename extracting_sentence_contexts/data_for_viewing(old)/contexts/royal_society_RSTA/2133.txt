Then, o (u,v) is obtained by integrating the right-hand side of (3.39):
~ ba
(du) =o" |" (By, ¥) ~ Bosd)) ay. (3.42)
It is clear that, starting with the lowest-order B obtained by dropping the O(e) terms in (3.40), we
can achieve successive approximations for o and I’.

This completes the second step of reduction, but only for the simple phase equation (3.36).
There are at least four conditions to be relaxed by which the formulation of the second step of
reduction can be generalized. First, higher-order terms may be included in (3.36) with which we
start. As a result, many-body coupling will necessarily be included. Second, larger assembly of
oscillators than an oscillator pair can be treated. Third, the coupling may be asymmetric. Fourth,
the oscillators may be slightly non-identical. The phase equation including all these facts will take
the form

ba = Wala) +€ > Gap. (bar bp) + (= CO, aba bp) + YG, alas bp, by ) +++ (3.43)

To integrate all such complex situations into the theory would not be a difficult matter if we do

not mind lengthy calculations. Omitting all calculational details, we arrive at the final form of

phase reduction
