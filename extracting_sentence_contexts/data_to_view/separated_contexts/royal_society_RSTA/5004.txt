Moreover, the bands were always accompanied by lines, and the lines
were stronger in the spectra of the alloys than in the compounds. The principal
lines were always distinctly visible when the conditions were such that the bands
could barely be seen. For instance, when the spectrum of spiegel-eisen was photo-
graphed with a very short exposure, in fact by a mere flash of light, or when steel
containing a very small amount of manganese was burnt in the oxyhydrogen flame
and its spectrum photographed. â€˜The various materials used have been ferro-
manganese, containing 80 per cent. of manganese, spiegel-eisen, contaiming 18 to 20
per cent., silico-spiegel, containing 10 per cent.
