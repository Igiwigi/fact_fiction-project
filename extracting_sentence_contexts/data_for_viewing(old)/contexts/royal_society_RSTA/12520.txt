The star was not again observed until September 2, 1877 (the estimated magnitude
being 10°5), when the startling fact was at once apparent that the spectrum was
restricted practically to a single line. The measurements show that this was the line
near 500. On September 6, it was observed that in addition to the chief line there
were traces of one or two lines on the violet side of the chief line, but very close to
it. On this date it was noted that the star did not give a sharp image, but that the
“extreme diameter could not be above 2 seconds or 14 seconds.” On October 1 the
star was examined with a view to detecting any very faint continuous spectrum, but
nothing of the kind was visible. On October 10, Lord Linpsay noted that “ since the
last measures a decided change is to be seen, as the light is more spread out. The
mean brightness is still as before, but is divisible into two lines very close together
with a dark gap, and then another very faint line.” Measurements of the three lines
were made with the following results :-—- ~
