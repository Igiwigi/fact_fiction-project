were quite pale. It thus appears that the reversal is due to low intensity rather than
to differences in the spectroscopic quality of the light, as might have been inferred
from the fact that the response was first observed in lamplight. The phenomenon can be most strikingly demonstrated in the following way: the
experiment is performed in a room whose windows are in one wall, along the whole
length of which there is a laboratory bench just under the windows. A chameleon
is put into a white enamel dish.
