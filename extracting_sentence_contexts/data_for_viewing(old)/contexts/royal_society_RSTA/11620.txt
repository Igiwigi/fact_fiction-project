Tn any group of normal isomeric esters, the formate has the largest value of mole-
cular viscosity work (compare ethyl formate with methyl acetate; propyl formate
with ethyl acetate). The other members of the group have values which are prac-
tically identical (ethyl acetate 333, methyl propionate 334 ; propyl acetate 408, ethyl
propionate 407, methyl butyrate 408. Methyl isobutyrate follows the general rule
in giving a smaller value than the methyl butyrate.

Values for ether oxygen at temperatures of equal slope have been calculated using
the values given in our previous paper for CH, and carbonyl oxygen, but it is evident
that the values afforded by the esters are not independent of molecular weight, as
they diminish, without exception, as any series of esters is ascended. Moreover, it
is not possible to allow for the fact already noted that the molecular viscosity of an
isomeric ester is the smaller the more nearly the number of carbon atoms in the
acid radicle approximates to the number in the alcohol radicle. The main result,
however, comes out as clearly as in the first condition of comparison that ether
oxygen has invariably an effect on molecular viscosity widely different from the
effects of hydroxyl oxygen and carbonyl oxygen. ‘Thus, in the case of molecular
viscosity, the values obtained were—

Hydroxyl oxygen . . . . . 166

Although these numbers can only be considered as first approximations, they
