tBe vertebrates, while the modification and enlargement which has taken place in the
aBaptation of dermal spines to serve as teeth is but slight in some, whilst in others
iBbis considerable.
â€˜But although they have been investigated and described with care, the literature
Fe the subject is not at all copious, perhaps because the classical paper of Herrwie (1)

on the structure and development of placoid scales has seemed to cover the ground
getty completely.
2 Much that forms the subject of the present communication has been touched upon
% Herrtwie in the excellent and accurate paper referred to, though not in sufficient
Hetail for its full elucidation. And, although it might not have been worth while
erely to amplify detail, it so happens that some slight errors of observation and of
igterpretation have led to the fact that some of the very points which appear to
Se to be of chief importance from a morphological standpoint, have been overlooked
a but briefly treated.
3 Hence it will be necessary, in addition to describing certain new points, to
Seiaiitalnte and to amplify what has already been published, in order to render
Attelligible that which I have to bring forward.

Of the dentine in these teeth I have not much to suy ; in many of them it is of the
ordinary fine-tubed variety, whilst in others it is typical osteodentine.

Thus all of the Rays examined have dentine of the fine-tubed variety, as have also the
transitional Rhina squatina, Carcharias, Seymnus, Galeus, Acanthias, and Seyllium.
