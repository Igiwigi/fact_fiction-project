Transformation from nerve nets to compact
brains in the Xenacoelomorpha: an
evolutionary scenario

Within Xenacoelomorpha, we consider the epidermal nerve

net of xenoturbellids as the ancestral condition (because of

the relative position of xenoturbellids within this group and

because Xenoturbella has the shortest branch in all molecular

phylogenies). This assumption would be consistent with

2 2 either of the two hypotheses regarding the placement of
this clade in the metazoan tree: as basal bilaterians or as
the sister taxa of Ambulacraria. Let us now revisit these
two alternatives.
