vesicles arise separately from the archenteron is that of Antedon, and in that case the epigastric coelom
arises from the posterior vesicle.—ovember 6, 1902.

300 PROFESSOR E. W. MACBRIDE ON THE DEVELOPMENT

certain abnormal larvee it developed lobes exactly corresponding to those of the left
hydroceele. In the case of Echinus esculentus such larvee were not found. Still we
can assert that the “dorsal sac,” or to use a purely non-committal name, the
madreporie vesicle, originates from the posterior end of the right anterior
caelom exactly as the left hydroccele originates from the hinder end of the left
anterior coelom ; and the fact that it is a solid outgrowth, and not, as in the case of
Asterina gibbosa, a hollow evagination, is correlated with the feeble development and
narrow lumen of the ecelomie sacs in the echinopluteus, as compared with the larva of
the asterid.

Reviewing the course of development so far, we see that the right coelomic sac
undergoes the same changes as the left, but that they are slower in making their
appearance, and this agrees with what was observed in the case of Asterina gibbosa,
and it is to the first indication of that preponderance of the organs of the left side
which is one of the main factors in the development of Echinodermata (see text-fig. 1).
