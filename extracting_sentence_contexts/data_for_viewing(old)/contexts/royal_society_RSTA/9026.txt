to p {110}, occasionally with especial elongation of one parallel pair of the p-prism
faces only (fig. 2).

The great majority of the crystals obtained were of the tabular type illustrated in
fig. 1, and this type proved very useful in the optical work, as the bisectrix of the
obtuse angle between the optic axes is nearly identical with the normal to the plate,
which latter is parallel to the faces of the basal plane ¢ {001}. The type shown in
fig. 2 was represented by one of the finest and largest crystals obtained. In all the
crystals the c-faces and p-faces predominated, usually the former to the greatest
extent. The g-faces were, as with all the potassium salts of the series, small. The
r’-faces were generally rather large, and sometimes were very prominent indeed, a fact
which has been observed to be characteristic of the iron groups of both the double
sulphates and double selenates. Three good measurements were obtained from little
a-faces, of a narrow type but excellently reflecting. The faces of b {010}, o’ {111},
and n/ {121} were only very minute (usually almost imperceptible lines), and afforded
no adequate reflections of the signal. Several little p’-faces were observed, however,
and in two cases good measurements were obtained.

The table of angles is given on the next page, and it is a somewhat surprisingly
satisfactory one, considering the circumstances under which these six crystals had to
be measured.
