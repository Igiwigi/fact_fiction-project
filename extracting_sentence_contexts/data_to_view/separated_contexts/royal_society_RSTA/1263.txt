It can be checked that at least in the BE formalism stationary solutions of the Q-tensor
equations, i.e. satisfying (3.1), automatically satisfy the constraint (5.1). This is no longer the
case for time-dependent solutions. In fact, J.L. Ericksen, considering the case when the inertia
is present (thus having also a second time-derivative in (2.1)) and working in the EL formalism,
called these solutions ‘twist-waves’ [113]. These are solutions which exhibit dynamic behaviour
of the directors, such that they do not create a velocity flow.
