combustion (PAC) in hydrocarbon-containing mixtures. Despite the fact that the PAI/PAC topic
has been developing for more than 15 years [1-3], a limited number of experiments is available
for high pressures, typical for combustion environment. Three main discharge configurations are
used for PAI at high pressures: nanosecond spark in a few millimetres gap between two point-
to-point electrodes; transient plasma ignition (TPI) where current is limited by interelectrode
distance and/or pulse duration; and nanosecond surface dielectric barrier discharge (nSDBD)
where current is limited by the presence of a thin dielectric layer between the electrodes. The
first configuration in repetitive mode is called nanosecond repetitive pulsed discharge (NRPD)
and widely studied for sustaining combustion [4].
