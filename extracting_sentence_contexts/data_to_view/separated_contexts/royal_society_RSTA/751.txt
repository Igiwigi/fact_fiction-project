In short, practising frugal : =
behaviours was something that participants appeared to both enjoy and value (supporting the [4
work of Kasser within this volume [36]). It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that negative 1S
feelings were associated with wasteful behaviours and unnecessary consumption (e.g. throwing :3
away and/or having to replace things that should be mendable). While it may perhaps be : g

somewhat discouraging that our participants did not appear to be motivated specifically by
environmental concerns, a number of recent publications have suggested that both frugality and
voluntary simplicity may in fact be more helpful drivers of pro-environmental behaviours, and
have similar end results [37-39]. Furthermore, research suggests that feelings of positive affect
resulting from acting pro-environmentally (and arguably also by extension frugally) can actually
motivate continued engagement with pro-environmental behaviours [40].

6. Policy implications

This research has demonstrated that regret and unhappiness with consumption are not simply
a result of misguided individual choices.
