hydrogene and potash.”

These gentlemen are said to have heated potassium in ammonia, and found that
the ammonia was absorbed, and that hydrogene gas equal to two-thirds of its
volume appeared, and that the potassium by this process had become of a grayish-
green colour. By heating this grayish-green substance considerably, two-fift!:s of the
ammonia were again emitted, with a quantity of hydrogene and nitrog2ne correspond=-
ing to one-fifth more, and by adding water to the mixture, and heating it very strongly
again, they obtained the remainder of the ammonia, and nothing but potash was left.

In these complex” processes, the phenomena may be as easily explained on the idea
of potassium being a-simple, as that of its being a compound substance z nor when
the facts that haye been stated in this paper and those about to be stated, are con-
sidered, can' the yiew of these distinguished chemists, as detailed in the notice referred
to; be at all admitted.

Potash, as I have found by numerous experiments, has no affinity for ammonia, for
it 'does not absorb it when heated'in it; it is nor therefore (allowing their theory)
possible' to conceive that a $ubstance having no attraction for potash, should repel
from it a substance which is intimately combined with it, and which can be separated
in no other way.

A part of the hydrogene evolyed in their experiment, may be furnished by water
contained in the ammonia z but 'it is scarcely possible "that the whole of it can be
derived from this 5ource, for on $uch an idea the ammonia must contain more than half
