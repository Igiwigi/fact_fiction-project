STATISTICAL ESTIMATION 353

If P is permanently equal to «, then P {EcA (6’;)|6’,, 0’s,... 6’} must be also
equal to «, whatever 0’, 0’,,... 6’, which proves the proposition. Corollary II—It follows from the Proposition III that whatever the value 0’, of
6,, the region of acceptance A (6’,) could not be empty. In fact, if for any value
6’, the region A (0,’) as defined above did not contain any points at all, then the
probability P {EeA (6’,)|9’,,... 6} would be zero, which would contradict the
Proposition ITI. Proposition III describes the fundamental property of any single region of
acceptance A (6,) taken separately. We shall now prove three propositions con-

eming the whole set of the regions A (6,) corresponding to all possible values of 6,.
