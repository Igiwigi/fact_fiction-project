both cases. In @alawxea, each “stria” is really linear, being almost knife-edged, and
having a single granulation now and then upon it. In Mussa, the ridge has no sharp
edge, but is a broad swelling, on which numerous granulations are scattered, appa-
reutly irregularly.

The “stria” in Galawea is the surface appearance presented by a single vertical
series of trabecular parts—is, in fact, uni-trabeculate ; while the “ridge” of Mussa is
an appearance produced by a diverging group of trabeculae—is, in contradistinction,
multi-trabeculate.

I shall in future give more than a descriptive value to the terms “stria” and
“ridge.” The term “ stria” may be limited to the superficial aspect on one side of a
bilaterally symmetrical trabecula; the term “ridge” to the superficial aspect on one
side of a group of trabecule, In Mussa, the component trabecule of a ridge are
all bilaterally symmetrical. The fibres aggregate either on both sides of one centre,
or of two centres not diverging far from the median plane of the septum.

It is necessary to define those terms clearly, as I wish to avoid the use of the word
“spine,” which has been applied by Frecu (cf: Introd., p. 100) to ridges on the surface
