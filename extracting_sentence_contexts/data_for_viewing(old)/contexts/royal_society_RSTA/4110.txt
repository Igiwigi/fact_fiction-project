Traditionally speaking, the flow response (before gelation) is usually simulated separately from
the solid response [39], and stress development is only considered in the solid state. In the solid
state, the responses of the fibre and matrix are combined through a suitable micromechanical
model such as Hashin’s CCA model [40,41]. To do so, either PVE or viscoelastic properties of


the resin, along with fibre properties, are used to calculate lamina-level properties; K and G (i.e.
bulk and shear moduli). Upon calculating the residual stresses at the lamina level, a reverse
micromechanics approach [19] can be employed to calculate average phase level stresses.

However, there are issues with the above-mentioned traditional approach. One main
drawback is that stress development, in fact, initiates pre-gelation [42-44]. Early in the cure cycle
when the resin is essentially a viscous fluid, interaction of tool and wavy fibre bed may result in
appreciable stress development [42]. This effect is intensified by the mismatch of thermal strains
(ie. CTE difference), debulking pressure, geometrical features and tool surface condition. Post-
gelation, when the resin becomes viscoelastic, this residual stress will be shared between resin
and fibre.

From a numerical standpoint, there are perhaps two approaches to capture residual stress
development in the material starting from the pre-gelation state.
