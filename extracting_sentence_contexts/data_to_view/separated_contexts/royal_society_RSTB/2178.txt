It is not possible to harmonise the observations
of Mrykowsk1 with those of Coury and OrcHANSKY, nor those of Apucco with that
of Horstey and Spencer. It is clear that such divergent results may depend not
only upon differences in technique, but on differences in individual animals, In such a
case as this a positive result is of greater worth than a negative. The degree of
anzemia produced by ligation of the four cerebral arteries is not the same in the dog
as in the rabbit or monkey, and this fact has not been taken into account by previous
writers. It is, moreover, no easy matter to satisfactorily investigate the cortical
excitability in any other animal than the monkey. It is often a matter of no little
difficulty to demonstrate cortical excitability in dogs, that is to say, when the dogs
are etherised and the cortex exposed and at once excited.
