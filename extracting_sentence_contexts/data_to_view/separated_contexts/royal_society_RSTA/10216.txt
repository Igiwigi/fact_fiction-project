This approximation does not, however, suftice for
determinations of cross-section. In such eases the complete formula has been
employed. The fact that in any determination of L and W the mercury column may not
completely occupy the interior of the tube is not a serious disturbing factor, since, if
L*/W is accurately known for any one portion of the tube, its value for any other
portion may be estimated from the calibration data. Let L,, L,, 8), 8, W), and W, represent the relative lengths, mean cross-sections,
and masses of mercury occupying two different portions of the same tube. Then

L/W, _ LS, _ Ly (m +a +0, +...) (2 Wo/dy + a,Wo/d., ++ - +) ;
L/W, LS, Ly (my + ay + bg +...) (ZWy/A, + 4,W)/d,, +...)

where the values of 7), mg, @, %, &e., are obtainable from the calibration data.
