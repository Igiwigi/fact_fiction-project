* These experiments have been extended to a great number of mixed oils and to soft solids, gums
and resins, combined with the prisms A and B, I have also substituted for these prisms others of
different kinds of glass, which give similar results ; and I have examined the phenomena at the con-
fines of different fluids and a great number of minerals of various refractive powers between chromate
of lead and fluor spar.


200 DR. BREWSTER ON REFLECTED LIGHT.

II. Those in which periodical colours are produced at the confines of parti-
cular kinds of glass, and various fluids and soft solids.

From the first of these classes of facts the following conclusions may be drawn.

1. The reflective and refractive forces in media of the same refractive power
do not follow the same law. This result is clearly established by the experi-
ments with the prism B, which produced no orders of colours. Not only was
there a strong reflected pencil when a perfect equilibrium was effected between
the opposite refracting forces, but there was not even an approximation to
evanescence as the forces adyanced to their point of compensation. 'The same
result was obtained with a prism newly ground and polished.

2. The force which produces reflection varies according to a different law in
different bodies. If the curve which represents the law of the reflective force
were exactly the same in the prism B and the fluids combined with it, then the
