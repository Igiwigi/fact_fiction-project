initiation of DHNA binding facilitates a series of structural
changes that help to achieve this. In the Sau-MenD structure,
the Arg98 side chain forms hydrogen bonds to residues 308-
309. Movement of the Arg98 side chain to interact with
DHNA would free the region around residues 305-312 and
enable the adoption of a more open conformation for these resi-
dues. There is precedence for the movement of this region in
Mtb-MenD; the equivalent region (residues 300-308) has con-
formational differences between the DHNA-bound and
DHNA-free forms. Rearrangement of this part of the allosteric
site upon ligand binding is not unprecedented across other
ThDP-dependent decarboxylase superfamily enzymes either.
In fact, it can be important for the allosteric mechanism; pyru-
vate decarboxylase binds the positive allosteric regulator
pyruvate in a similar structural location to the DHNA binding
site in MenD, causing significant rearrangement of the allo-
steric site region and propagation of allosteric signal to the
active site [59].

The exploitation of allosteric sites is an emerging strategy
for inhibitor development, but it was not known whether
compounds targeting the MenD allosteric site would inhibit
the growth of whole cells in vivo. One advantage of allosteric
sites is that they tend to bind relatively hydrophobic com-
pounds, which are associated with cell permeability [31].
