atom evaporation from the filament is large compared with the rate of emission of
positive ions since the auxiliary strip only intercepts a small fraction, about one-
thirtieth, of the neutral atoms leaving the filament. 10—Tue Postrtve lon Work Function The fact that the migration of the atoms is insufficient to maintain a uniform phase
throughout the whole of the oxide when emission is taking place from the surface
prevents the determination of the work function of the positive ions for a range of
values of the surface concentration. For suppose that, with a given number of atoms

on the surface the positive ion current is measured at a given temperature, on
lowering the temperature to a new value the positive ion current will change not only
as a consequence of the reduction in temperature of the oxide but because the
concentration of atoms at the actual emitting surfaces increases as a result of the
reduced rate of emission at the lower temperature. It was found that if measurements
were made with a given number of atoms deposited on the oxide then the values of
log v, plotted against 1/T, where T is the absolute temperature of the oxide, gave
points lying accurately on a straight line.
