female flew off again, closely pursued by the male, until she again alighted on the
cage wall; this time, instead of sitting with the wings expanded, they were elevated
and closed over the back, while the body, instead of being almost parallel to the
surface of the cage, was raised almost at right angles to it. This is the attitude
invariably assumed before pairing, which in this case immediately took place.”

The aérial dance is always a great feature in the courting of the butterflies and is
evidently appreciated by the females, for they were frequently observed to follow and
hover behind an apathetic male which had settled before they were satisfied. A
further feature in the female, which was quite unexpected, was that she seemed
most attractive during the intermediate days between the two periods of consent ; in
fact, she was most attractive during the time when it was practically hopeless to
attempt a pairing. These peculiarities in the female naturally made it more difficult
to obtain reliable evidence of selective mating, and for the same reason observations
had to be made rather on the male than the female. The following cases, abstracted
directly from notes taken at the time, are typical :—

On January 10, 1912, a ¢ 37* was offered first a. 2 cyrus 87, then a 2 polytes
wild,t and then a ? vomulus 39, but he showed no inclination to pair, though the
females mentioned were all willing. Then he was given a ? cyrus wild and pairing
immediately took place. On January 11 the same male 37 was offered a ? cyrus 37
but refused ; then he was given a ? cyrus 39 and he paired at once.

A second ¢ 37 emerged on January 14, but refused to pair that day ; on the 15th
