Bunds, The measured absorptions of a sufficient number of substances, in relation to
Heir sounding power, shall be tabulated immediately. E The fact is worth a passing reference that the chlorides of the elements appear one

d all to be feeble sound producers, because they are one and all feeble absorbers of
Adiant heat. Many years ago I had found them highly diathermanous, and accepted
Ehloride of sodium as representative of the class. Silicium chloride, for example, though
Sery volatile is weak as a sound producer, Tetrachloride of carbon, and terchloride of
Ehosphorus are also volatile, but not strong.
