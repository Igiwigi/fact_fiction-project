ments of the system on the other, and this, during the action and under the influence
of the chlorine, it may truly be.

If it be true that in the preceding experiments this polar division of the element
takes place, (a division, at any rate, in many points analogous to the decomposition
of the compound body when no elemental substance is isolated, but the particles are
transferred from one system to another,) it cannot but be, that in the formation of
the element the correlative fact is to be observed, and that the element itself is made
by the synthesis of polar particles. This is indicated by theory, and although the
more usual mode of forming these elemental bodies is not such as to bring to light
the true nature of this synthesis, there are other, although as yet rarer, instances of
the formation of these bodies, which not only are not opposed to this view, but
prove it.

1. When an acid is added to a perfectly pure solution of an alkaline iodide, such
as may readily be procured by precipitating any iodate it contains by baryta water
and filtering, the solution remains perfectly clear. Neither, when an acid is added
to a pure solution of iodate of potash, is there any alteration, but on mixing these
Solutions an abundant precipitate of iodine is formed. It is said that the iodate and
iodide of zinc, without acid, undergo a similar decomposition. It is very plain that
