unheated metal film, but even if they should be, our picture does not need any
essential modification. We have only to suppose that the aggregate is built up by
an ordering of these very small blocks, instead of by the ordering of single atoms.

If the birefringent form, consisting of radial fibres with incompletely ordered
atoms between them, really exists, it will clearly be metastable when it reaches a
certain size, so that, if the atoms have a certain amplitude of vibration, the whole
will gradually settle down to a cubic lattice form, The conversion will start at the
centre, where the arrangement already approaches the close-packed state ;_ the
atoms added subsequently to the original approximately spherical cluster will release
the surface tension effect.

The next stage in growth confronts us with the following facts: (a) that the
crystal develops preferentially on a (111) face, () that new metal sputtered on a

(111) face of a well-grown crystal does not add itself to the crystal, but forms an
amorphous layer, which on heating crystallizes into separate spherulets. A
tentative explanation may be given in terms of ideas first put forward by Kosse,+
who considered, however, only the simplest cubic structure. The atom of a face-
centred cubic crystal has, in the body of the crystal, 12 nearest neighbours, distant
2a, if the side of the unit cube be taken as 2 a; 6 neighbours distant 2 a ; 8 neigh-
bours distant \/6 a. For an atom which has just been added to an incomplete
