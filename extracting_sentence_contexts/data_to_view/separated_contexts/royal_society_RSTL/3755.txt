Not one among
them was found calculated to fulfil the two indications I required; a cireumstance
which tends to corroborate, in a great degree, Dr. ProuT's statement,—* that uncom-
bined agents of the alkaline or acid kind are ill-calculated to act as s0Jvents for cal-
culi; and that solvents are to be sought for among a class of harmless and unirrita-
ting compounds, the elements of which are s0 associated as to act at the same time
with respect to calculous ingredients, both as alkalies and acids*,”

«At present,” continues Dr. ProvuT, *no such class of compounds of a decided
character are known, or appear likely to be discovered; yet, as no chemical fact can
be stated & priori, we know not what remains in store among the arcana of nature.” The conviction I had acquired of the truth of these observations induced me to
abandon all attempts at positive or direct solution, but rather to try the effect of in-
direct means, namely those of decomposition and disintegration ; as preliminaries to
s0lution by some bland fluid, or to mechanical remoyal, by the injection of a con-
tinuous stream of liquid through a double current catheter. It appeared, hitherto, to have been the object, to act on calculi by single elective
affinity only ; that is, to dissolve the base before it was disengaged from its associated
acid.
