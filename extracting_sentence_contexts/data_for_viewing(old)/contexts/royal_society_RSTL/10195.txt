the 8iphonozooids, however, the 8iphonoglyphe is very well marked ; there is a decided
thickening of the epithelium ; it extends along nearly the whole of the ventral side
of the stomodzum, from the month to the body-cavity ; ib extends round the wall

of the stomodeum frequently as far as the insertion of the yentro-lateral mesenteries,
and the cilia are characteristically long and strong (Plate 50, fig. 5).

It is exceedingly probable, from these facts, that the great part of the circulation in
Sarcophyton is carried on by the siphonozooids, whilst the autozooids carry on the |
same function to a much smaller extent.

The genus Paragorgis is also dimorphic, a fact which seems to have hed previously
overlooked, and here we find a condition concerning the siphonoglyphe slightly
different from that found in Sarcophyton.

After a careful examination of numerous autozooids, both in the retracted and
expanded condition, I could find no trace of a true siphonoglyphe. There seems to be
no marked thickening of the epithelium on the ventral side of the stomodzum, nor
are the cilia markedly longer or stronger in that region (Plate 50, fig. 6).
