They laid little stress on the rdle played by
circulatory failure, and in support of their views they quoted a number of experiments
in which cardiac pulsations continued after the apparent death of the animal. In
volume 22 they go on to discuss the subject still further. With the facts at their
disposal they were unable to come to any definite conclusion as to the exact influence
of the venom on the heart, but they thought that the heart’s arrest in systole, which
they at times observed was due to “some action on the cardiac ganglia.” They drew
attention to the great difference observed in the effect of venom according as it was
applied to the surface or to the interior of the heart. In this connection they quote
an experiment in which they perfused the frog-heart with a solution of Cobra venom,
and obtained arrest of it in a position midway between systole and diastole.
