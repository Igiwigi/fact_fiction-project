Ficure 12. Stereographic projection. Diamond, Cu Ka, radiation, on plane parallel to cube face of
crystal, showing coincidences of several circles at A and Q. This projection may be compared with the
photograph shown in plate 17, figure 23a, which was taken on a semi-cylindrical film, remembering,
however, that the photograph shows lines corresponding to Cu Ka,, a and # radiations.

which may be compared with plate 16, figure 20d. Contrary to expectation, the lines obtained
from a single crystal of natural ice (grown on the surface of water in a basin, during cold
weather) were extremely fine and sharp when they could be seen at all, and it was often
found that no pattern, or only the faintest pattern, appeared even when the ice crystal used
was of suitable thickness and gave a good Laue photograph. This seems to indicate a high
degree of perfection in natural ice crystals even near to 0Â° CG, an indication which is confirmed .

some, presumably more mosaic, specimens, and by the further observation that, on the
whole, the single ice crystals were rather weak reflectors when the usual parallel-beam methods
were used.

It will be noticed that the lines in divergent-beam photographs of ice and also in those of
less symmetrical organic compounds, are much less curved than many of those in diamond
photographs (cf. plate 16, figures 20 c, d and plate 17, figure 23 b,c). This is because diamond
