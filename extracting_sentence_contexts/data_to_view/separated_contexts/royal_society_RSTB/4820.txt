In sections 3, 4, and 5 of the table similar comparisons are made for successively
increased severity of the destruction of species. In section 5, with 100 cataclysms each
killing-out one-third of the then existing species, the total number of species killed-out
would be over 700,000, the free doubling-period would be lowered to 1-3 million years,
and the present rate of production of specific mutations would be raised to 1 in some 12
years. -

But unfortunately, as already stated, there seems no basis at present for estimating
even roughly the total number of extinct species, so as to estimate whereabouts on the
table the truth in fact lies. That line of approach, at present at all events, is not possible. But another and more hopeful line is afforded by the second columnâ€”the chance of a
species surviving.
