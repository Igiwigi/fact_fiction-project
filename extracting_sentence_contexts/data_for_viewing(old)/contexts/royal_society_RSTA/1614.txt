NA is limited to the refractive index of the sample), despite other measurements with the same
objective showing that significant super-critical light can be present [40].

It is particularly instructive to compare this answer (yes) with the companion given by
Heintzmann: ‘a clear “no”’ [20]. For Heintzmann, taking equation (2.17), all forms of SIM
break the emission Abbe limit and hence break the diffraction limit. This equation can be used
to define a new limit, that of ‘restricted super resolution’, introduced by Sheppard [41]. For
TIRF-SIM, the structured illumination pattern has a finer frequency than that permitted by the
refractive index of the sample, and so Heintzmann says that TIRF-SIM breaks this ‘restricted super
resolution’ criterion. Hence, the suggestion is that TIRF-SIM is not diffraction-limited even under
the considerations of this more strict approach.

However, the fact remains that the fineness of the illumination pattern is limited by diffraction,
just in a medium of refractive index n rather than 2. Even in the situation where the sample was
mounted on a diamond coverslip (ignoring the deleterious effects of the strong dispersion in such
a material) and we had an objective lens with numerical aperture matching that of the refractive
index of the material, 2.4, TIRF-SIM of the same sample as Li et al. used could not produce a
resolution better than
