fundamental limit’ because of dependence upon extrinsic random factors [47]. Such limits must
be considered before determinations about an algorithm’s relevance, or otherwise, can be made
(see for example [11]). For instance, the national Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme in the
UK, known as Clare’s law (named after Clare Wood, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend,
who had a history of violence towards women), has at its very heart an assessment of risk by
the police, requiring them to make a judgement as to whether to disclose information about an
individual to the person with whom they are forming a relationship [48]. They can only do this
if there is a ‘pressing need’ for that disclosure, i.e. that the risk of harm reaches a certain level.
There is potential for algorithmic tools to help officers to make ‘better bets’ or even improve
the currently rather opaque decision-making process relating to this information-sharing scheme.
The debate around the use of actuarial algorithmic tools could present an opportunity to clarify
the sort of risks that would result in a ‘pressing need’ for disclosure, and what factors should
go into that assessment. Of course, Clare’s law, and domestic violence, in general, is a factually
and emotionally complex sphere requiring a focus upon the (potential) victim as well as the
perpetrator, and an appreciation that stark conviction and arrest data will not often present the
full picture.

(e) Irrelevant considerations—reframing for algorithm-assisted decision-making in the
public sector

Eighteenth-century Morgan would have appreciated this search for relevancy; his criticism of
the pre-existing rule was based on its absurd results in the real world, its lack of ‘truth’, such
as the probability of an 18-year-old surviving one 78-year-old being calculated as less than the
18-year-old surviving two 78-year-olds [2]. The pre-existing rule reflected neither observation nor
common sense. As Mulgan points out:
