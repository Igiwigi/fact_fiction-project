It is important to
remember that titanous sulphate, the reagent commonly used to detect hydrogen peroxide,
is unreliable in the presence of formaldehyde (Wheeler eÂ¢ al. 1948) which is always present
in engine solutions. This makes it of interest to determine the effect of hydrogen peroxide when added to
the engine charge. The experiment is not easy to accomplish, owing to the fact that hydrogen
peroxide is but sparingly soluble in petrol and also is very unstable and explosive in the
presence of organic matter. Some tests were, however, carried out in which a 30% aqueous
solution of hydrogen peroxide was sprayed into the induction manifold of the engine and
its effect on the h.u.c.r. determined (figure 8). Blank tests were carried out with the injection
of distilled water.
