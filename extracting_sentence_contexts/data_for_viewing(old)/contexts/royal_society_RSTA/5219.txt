whether participants had heard of the term geoengineering previously (‘yes’ or ‘no’). The second
asked participants to indicate on a five-point scale how much they knew about geoengineering,
from ‘I have not heard about geoengineering’ to ‘I know a great deal about geoengineering’.
Participants were then presented with a screen that was described as containing a ‘factsheet’
titled Geoengineering: a new approach for tackling climate change?, ostensibly downloaded from
‘This figure is somewhat higher than those obtained in some other national surveys. Typically, between 3% and

5% of the population state membership of an environmental organisation (e.g. British Household Panel Survey,

the website climateinfo.org (see electronic supplementary material, appendix S2, for the full
factsheets, which were in fact created solely for the purpose of the experiment). Each factsheet
contained text describing some of the expected risks of climate change and briefly outlining
possible societal responses to it, including mitigation, adaptation and a third (new) option of
geoengineering. Thus, geoengineering was situated as one of three options for responding to
climate change.

The penultimate paragraph of all versions of the factsheet described geoengineering as
follows:

Most geoengineering technologies have not yet been developed, and so there is a great deal
of uncertainty about their risks and benefits. There are likely to be some serious risks and
side effects associated with geoengineering (e.g. changes to global rainfall patterns) but they
