IT is now generally acknowledged that the process of nutrition in most animal
tissues consists in changes undergone by the nutrient liquor sanguinis, which has
exuded into them through the coats of the capillaries ramifying throughout them. The
vessels themselves vary in number in different structures : in muscle, the capillaries
are very numerous, and the spaces between them very small ; whilst in tendon and
ligament, on the other hand, the latter are comparatively large ; but in all structures,
whatever may be the degree of their vascularity, the tissue the furthest removed
from the vessel is nourished equally well with that which is in immediate contact
with it. In all yascular structures, therefore, there is of necessity a considerable extent of
tissue which is nourished without being in contact with blood-vessels, and the know-
ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to the study of the process of nutri-
tion in those organs, into which, whilst in a healthy state, anatomists have never
succeeded in tracing blood-vessels. The organized tissues, constituting such non-
vascular organs, may be divided into three classes :

The first, comprehending articular cartilage, and the cartilage of the different
classes of fibro-cartilage ;

The second. the cornea, the crystalline lens, and the vitreous humour ;

The third, the epidermoid appendages, viz. the epithelium, the epidermis, nails
and claws, hoofs, hair and bristles, feathers, horn, and teeth. It is to these tissues that the investigations I have now to communicate relate : I
shall endeavour to prove that no vessel ever enters them when they are perfectly
developed, and in a healthy state, and to demonstrate the manner in which they are
nourished.
