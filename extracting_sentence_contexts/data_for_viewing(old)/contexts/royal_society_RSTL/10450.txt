Abstract). Messrs. LiveinG and Dewar have published notes on quantitative spec-
troscopic experiments (Proc. Roy. Soc., vol. xxix., pp. 482-489), Observing the
emission spectrum of godium vapour, they sought to estimate the quantity of substance
present in a given space by measuring the width of the 8odium lines.

It has been already shown that; solutions containing the same element in different
proportions emib different variations of the same spectrum, the lines differing in 1
number, length, and intensity. T have also proved the converse of thisâ€”namely, that,
under the same spark conditions s1milar solutions of the same strength always emit the
8ame gpectrum. By similar solutions are meant 8olutions containing salts of the game
metal, the non-metallic constituents of which cannot affect the length or strength of
the metallic lines. Evidence of a quantitative nature in Part I. has established the
fact that chlorides, nitrates, sulphates, and carbonates are salts of a similar character
in this respect, and it has also been proved quantitatively in the case of chloride and
sulphate of copper. Tt is, however, doubtful whether solutions of borates and silicates
are strictly comparable with the solution of other salts, for the borates and silicates of
the alkalies emit strong lines, due to boron and silicon, and it certainly appears, from
the observations I have hitherto made, that the metallic spectra are modified by the
strong lines of these non-metallic elements.

On the swrength and length of lines in the metallic spectra yielded by solutions of
various slrengths, and on the limit of sensitiveness of the spectrum reaction.

The following investigation was made with the view of placing our knowledge of
spectrum analysis on a proper basis, 80 as to admit of its being applied more systemati-
