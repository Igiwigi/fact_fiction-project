& ring the whole of this time, the air entering into it muſt
occaſion an agitation or difturbance in the water, which,

preventing it to become, in the leaſt, colder than the
freezing point, without beginning to freeze, in conſe-
quence of which its congelation muſt begin immediately
after it is cooled to that point, When I refle& upon
this idea, I remember a fact which appears to me to ſup-
port it ſtrongly. FAHRENHEIT was the firſt perſon who
diſcovered that water, when preſerved in tranquillity,
may be cooled ſome degrees below the freezing point
without freezing. He made the diſcovery while he was
endeavouring to obtain ice from water that had been
purged of its air: with this intention he had put ſome
water into little glaſs globes, and having purged it of air,
by boiling and the air-pump, he ſuddenly ſealed up the
globes, and then expoſed them to the froſty air.
