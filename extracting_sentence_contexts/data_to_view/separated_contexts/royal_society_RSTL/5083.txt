The oxides of manganese, lead, cobalt, nickel, and silyer, for instance, are
= readily transformed by ozone into their corresponding peroxides. Whilst peroxide
S of calcium is formed, ozone exerts an oxidizing influence also upon the nitrogen con-
% tained in atmospheric air, and forms NO,, which uniting to CaO,, produces what we
Â© call nitrate of lime. bF The fact, that electrical sparks passing through a moist mixture of oxygen and
S nitrogen generate nitric acid, was first ascertained by Cavznpisn, 1785 ; in 1840 1
& made the observation that under the same circumstances ozone is- produced. Davy
= has found that traces of nitric acid are formed around the positive electrode if a
Z current passes through water containing atmospheric air or nitrogen, and I have
L agcertained that under the same circumstances ozone is generated. 5 From the facts above stated, it appears that during the slow combustion which
A phosphorus undergoes in moist atmospheric air nitric acid is formed, and we are now
well aware that ozone makes its appearance at the same time.
