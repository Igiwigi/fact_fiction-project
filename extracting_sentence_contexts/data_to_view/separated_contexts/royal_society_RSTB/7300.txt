Differences giving values of P<0-02 are regarded as significant. Apart from showing that most of the conclusions previously drawn from assessments of
the size and shape of the fossil teeth considered in the present paper need qualification, our
analysis does little more than point to the fact that in their metrical attributes these teeth
are more ape-like than human. We have not tried to consider the so-called qualitative
characteristics of the teeth, or to differentiate those which can be expressed quantitatively,
e.g. the occasional presence of minor cusps, from those which could be treated quantitatively
only with difficulty, and which for convenience could still be regarded as qualitative. It is
quite possible that among these qualitative attributes of the teeth, there are some which
are better matched in the human than the ape jaw.
