A round-oval
white disc is to be seen considerably above the visual axis. From this dise large
retinal vessels branch out right and left in a horizontal plane, and the area they
oceupy is covered by bundles of completely opaque nerve fibres, forming a pair of
broad white feather-like streaks, which part at the disc. The fact that all the retinal
vessels run entirely in these bundles, which are all above the line of vision, points to
an admirable contrivance of nature by which their inherent opacity affords no obstacle
to the animalâ€™s vision. In the lighter-coloured Rabbits choroidal vessels can be seen. In the Albinos, the
dense choroidal vascularisation is visible, as also the places where the vessels enter
the choroid through the sclerotic.
