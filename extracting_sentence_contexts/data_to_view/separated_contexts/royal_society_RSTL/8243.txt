11, Hyopotamus (Plate XXXVIIL. fig. 2), and Anthracotherium®. 'The outer or fifth digit of the manus and pes in all Ungulata Paridigitata (and, in
fact, in all existing Mammalia) is supported by the same carpal bone as the fourth. "There is not a single exception to this rule; and in all Mammalia, wherever the fourth
and fifth digits of the manus and pes are present, they are always supported by one bone
—the unciform in the manus, and its homologue (the cuboid) in the pes. Seeing that the full number of digits in Mammalia is five, while the number of carpal
and tarsal bones which give support to them never exceeds four—three inner digits
being supported each by a separate bone, while the two outer are always supported by a
single carpal and tarsal bone—the question may arise, is this relation primitive for all
Mammalia ?
