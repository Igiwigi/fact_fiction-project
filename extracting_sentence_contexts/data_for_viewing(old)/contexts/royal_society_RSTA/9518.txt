There appears to be some evidence that symmetrical and unsymmetrical reversed lines
give the same average shifts. The ratios of the average shifts for the different classes
are of interest in connection with the fact, first noted by HumpHreys, that for some

‘metals the lines tended to form three groups in which the ratios of the pressure-shifts

were approximately 1 : 2:4, when reduced to a standard wave-length. Later work has
confirmed HumPHReys’ view toa certain extent, notably in the case of the iron are, The
ratios, however, do not appear to be integral, and the grouping according to pressure-
shifts is, to a great extent, independent of the classification according to behaviour.
Under these circumstances it seems doubtful whether the phenomenon is anything more
than a chance arrangement such as would follow from considering “ small,” “ average,”
and “large” shifts. On the other hand, the relative shifts of lines whose behaviour
justifies the supposition that they are of radically different types is a question of more
direct interest, and the results, are more likely to be capable of theoretical
