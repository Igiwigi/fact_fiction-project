THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 711

pective of special theory, be a rational function of p?, and therefore when
vessed in partial fractions must assume the form 1 -++ ¥A,/(B, — p’); while in
case of opaque media the constants typified by A will be complex, and other
rtial fractions not corresponding to absorption bands will also enter.
_ In the case of opaque media, a peculiarity of this analysis, as compared with that
of yon Hetmuorrz* and others, is that the conduction current is derived from the
electric displacement by the inverse operator k (md/dt + o’)~! instead of a direct
rator involving a coefficient of conductivity in place of the coefticient of resist-
ance o’. Notwithstanding that there are as many as four adjustable constants, it is
= to some extent, to crucially compare the resulting formula for K’ with the
‘experimental facts for metallic media. It is known that the broad type of formal
Btheory which simply assigns to the metals a complex index of refraction K" is con-
firmed by the general agreement between results deduced trom calculations relating
Bio reflexion experiments by Brrr, Vorar, Drupe and others, and those obtained
aetly from deviation experiments with thin metallic prisms by Kunpv.t It turns
Sout however that the real part of K’ is invariably negative for metallic media; and
Bhhis i is a fundamental difficulty in ordinary elastic theories, as it implies instability of
Bithe optical medium. On the present theory it implies that / is sutliciently large to
allow the third term of K’ to outweigh the first two terms. It is also found (by both
methods) that if K’ = m (1 — ox), then for the better conducting metals, silver, gold,
Bhopper, n is less than unity, involving velocity of propagation greater than in a
“gvacuum, while « is a considerable number ;{ this implies that the fourth term in the
ormula for K’ is in these cases small compared with the third, which is just what is
