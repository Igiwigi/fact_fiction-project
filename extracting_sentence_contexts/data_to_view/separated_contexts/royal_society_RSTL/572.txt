- So obvious a peculiarity in the skeleton of the Cobra de Capello
having escaped my notice in India, and finding myself unable to
account for the expansion of its hood, which is commonly, in
that country, conceived to be connected with inspiration, I
brought with me, on my return to England, several subjects for
dissection, in order to have the matter properly ascertained. My
friend Mr, Hor readily undertook the task; and the subjoined
result of his'investigation will, I have no doubt, prove satisfactory. I have, on another occasion, asserted as a fact, that the neck
of the Cobra de Capello, in a quiescent state, hows no external
protuberance whatever; * and it is clearly accounted for, in the
following description, from the ribs, when depressed, lying upon
the: spine, over one another. Mr. Home's Description.
