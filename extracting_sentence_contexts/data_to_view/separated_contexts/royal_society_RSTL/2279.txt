NEWPORT ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE SPHINX LIGUSTRI. 403

converge, as in the Sphinx; and, in passing along the cords, gather a few filaments
from the motor tract of each, and after uniting in the middle line pass backwards to
the next ganglion, to be distributed as before. In this species it is curious that the
superadded nerves do not seem to unite with the great moto-sensitive nerve, but only
with the small nerve behind it, which is given to muscles that, acting diagonally,
seem to he much concerned in the function of respiration. But there are facts
which might at first incline us to believe that these transverse nerves constitute the
visceral or true sympathetic system in insects. Thus, their union with most of the
nerves of the body ; their connexion with the anterior lateral ganglia ; the manner
in which they receive additional filaments from the cords ; and the existence of a
ganglion upon the terminal filament in the Gryllus vividissimus, Lixx. [Plate XVI.
fig. 39. (c, b),] ; and, above all, the existence of clearly defined ganglia at each distri-
bution in the Carabi [fig. 38. (c),], or ground Beetles, and in the Mole Cricket, Gryl-
lotalpa, in which the ganglia are very distinct, and situated above the great ganglions
of the cords. On the other hand, it is only in a few genera of insects that these gan-
glia exist ; and it has not yet been proved that respiratory nerves must necessarily be
without ganglia.
