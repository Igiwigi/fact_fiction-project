Zine placed in the solution precipitates finely divided copper from the cupric
chloride, and this copper is rapidly re-dissolved, as explained above. The solution was found to dissolve the alloys rapidly unless the percentage of
copper was greater than 60, and, owing to this circumstance, the experiments were
not continued beyond the alloy containing 62Â°2 per cent. of copper. This difficulty arose from the fact that it was impossible to obtain those alloys
which are rich in copper in a sufficiently comminuted state. Specific Heat of the Solution. This was found in a manner similar to that previously described.
