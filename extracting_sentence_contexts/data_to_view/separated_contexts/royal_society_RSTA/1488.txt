By exploiting the computational structure of multiscale simulation,
the cost of a multiscale UQ can be reduced by relying on a family of recently proposed semi-
intrusive UQ methods [14]. In this manuscript, we extend the notion of exploiting generic
computational structure of multiscale simulations to further improve the computational efficiency
by identifying generic UQPs, and then implementing the UQ analysis with these UQPs. In fact,
we propose a series of uncertainty quantification patterns (UQPs) according to the degree of
intrusion and architecture of multiscale simulation. These UQPs provide basic building blocks
for creating tailored UQ for multiscale models. The UQPs are implemented as generic templates,
which can then be customized and aggregated to create a dedicated UQ procedure for multiscale
applications.
