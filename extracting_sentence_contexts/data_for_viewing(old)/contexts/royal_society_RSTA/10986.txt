In order to determine the strength of this limestone after deformation, the half-
column was then placed in an Emery testing machine and tested in compression. The
pressure was gradually increased without developing any signs of distress until a load
of 4200 Ibs. had been reached when it suddenly crushed to fragments. Rude half-
cones appeared to have sheared in at either end, which, however, were not coincident
with the traces of cones of the original marble, and strips split off the sides longi-
tudinally, precisely as in the case of the columns of the original marble when tested
in a similar manner. Columns of the original marble, in all respects identical with
those employed in the experiment, as has already been mentioned, crushed at a pressure
of between 11,430 and 12,025 lbs. per square inch. The crushing load of the marble
of the deformed half-column is equivalent to 10,652 Ibs. per square inch. Although
therefore the two cannot be compared with absolute exactness, owing to their dif-
ference in shape, and toe the fact that but a single test of the deformed marble was

made, it is clear that the deformed marble, if not quite as strong, is at least very
nearly as strong as the original rock. Twenty thin sections were cut from a portion
of the other half-column and examined under the microscope. The sections show
that the deformed rock possesses a more or less distinct foliation except at the ends
of the column, where practically no motion had taken place. Here scarcely any
trace of foliation is visible. Cataclastic structure is absent, but almost every grain
shows an exceedingly fine fibrous structure. When examined under a high power
this fibrous structure resolves itself into an extremely narrow polysynthetic twinning
