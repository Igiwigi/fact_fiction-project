The resistance of 3 ohms was then removed, and similar

observations gave 58 as the balancing-point. Immediately afterwards, the 3 ohms

resistance having been again introduced, the point appeared to be 56. The true

balancing-point when 3 ohms were in was therefore agsumed to be , and when

* Tt may be perhaps as well to state here that when small resistances were being compared, 10 ohms
instead of 100 ohms were generally employed, though this fact has not been always mentioned. AND STRAIN ON THE ACTION OF PHYSICAL FORCES, 163

the 3 ohms were removed to be 58. In this way the following results were arrived
at as the means of several trials ;â€”

Now when we bear in mind that one division of the iridio-platinum wire only
represents an alteration of resistance of 0033 per cent., it appears evident that
alteration of the strength of the B.C. can have but very small effect on the resistance,
and even if there is any alteration it is of s8uch a nature. as to show that circular
magnetization produces decredse, not increase of resistance.
