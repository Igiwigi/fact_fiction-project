palpebre in partially closing the eye after the orbicularis palpebrarum has been
paralysed by section of the facial nerve. He describes the synchronous blinking of
the eye, although in one eye these paralytic conditions obtain. I have also noted
this in the human subject when the: facial nerve has been divided, and where spino-
facial anastomosis has been done, but before any recovery could have been attributed
to that operation, and also in experimentally produced paralysis, and have explained
the phenomenon as due to the relaxation of the levator palpebrae and to movements
of the eyeball communicated to the flaccid eyelid (Part I, p. 126).


PARALYSED MUSCLES BY MEANS OF NERVE ANASTOMOSIS. 7t

From the point of view of the present consideration an important fact has been
proved by Suerrieron (23), who shows that although in the cat primary extension
of the knee as a motor reaction is only exceptionally obtained by cortical stimulation,
yet under the influence of certain doses of strychnine or of tetanus toxin a point is
found in the cortex which gives such a contraction. ‘ After exhibition of strychnine
extension of knee becomes elicitable regularly from the cortex, and from the very
points of it that yielded flexion previously” (23, p. 292). He shows that previously
to the exhibition of the strychnine these points were in relationship with the
extensors, but cortical stimulation caused not contraction but inhibition so as to
permit the movement of flexion. This is altered under strychnine, where the
inhibition is changed into contraction. It is important to note that it is necessary
to view the inhibition of the antagonistic muscles not as a passive but as an active
process, just as is the contraction of the protagonist muscles.
