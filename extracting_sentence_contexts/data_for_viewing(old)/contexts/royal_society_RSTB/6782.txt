(2) An Early Middle Bronze Age palstave with infolded flanges was found by Mr J.
Robins in Great Raveley Fen on the east side of the Raveley Drain (O.S. 6 in. sheet
XIV, N.W. Hunts., opposite L of Raveley Drain). He was digging out a “bog oak”
and it was found at a depth of 3 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. ““among the roots” (Garrood 1930).
Local enquiry at first suggested that this bog oak might have been one disturbed by
a dredger when cleaning the dyke, this being of frequent occurrence, as the oak horizon
is generally at dyke bottom in the Raveley Drain. The palstave might thus have been
incorporated in the root system of the tree secondarily. But reference to the map shows
that the site of the discovery is extremely marginal and, from what has previously been
stated in connexion with the oaks at site V and at Castlehill Farm, it will be realized
that even if the axe was genuinely in situ all the bog oaks of this district are not
necessarily contemporaneous with those of the lower peat. Nevertheless, the signi-
ficant fact remains that oak trees were growing at or after Middle Bronze Age times,
on sites which afterwards became wet enough to preserve the trees in growing peat.

(3) A Bronze Age socketed adze was found lying on a “bog oak” at Castlehill Farm
(Garrood 1929). Further enquiry suggested that this was ploughed up in a peat field
from a depth of about 15 in. and cannot, therefore, be regarded as undisturbed.

(4) Ramsey St Mary. A Middle Bronze Age spearhead was ploughed up some twenty
years ago on New Fen Farm between Ramsey and Ramsey St Mary. This site lies
approximately on the landward boundary of the buttery clay, and the record suggests
that the find was relatively superficial (Garrood 1930).
