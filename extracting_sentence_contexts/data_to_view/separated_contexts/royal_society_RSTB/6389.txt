This view is in accordance with the views expressed by BLocx (1896), SOLLAs (1907),
and others, concerning the origin of the radula and its teeth. They believe them to be
secreted and not to arise by transformation of the formative cells,

The absence of any definite ducts through the chitin, and any associated glands,


THE ALIMENTARY CANAL OF JORUNNA TOMENTOSA 183

renders it clear that the cuticle cannot arise in a manner similar to that described by
YONGE (19325) for the decapod Crustacea, and it must therefore arise either by the
transformation of the peripheral layers of chitin into a cuticular substance, or in a
manner similar to that described for Rhodnius prolixus by WIGGLESWORTH (1933), Where
he suggests that the underlying epithelium secretes the cuticle first, followed by the
chitin afterwards. The former suggestion is supported by the fact that the chitin of the
radula changes its properties with age. This was shown by Sottas (19074, 6), who
demonstrated that the young and old portions of the radula differed in chemical and
physical properties, and by Pantin and Rocers (1925), who found that the older
portion of the radula of Buccinum undatum, unlike the younger portion, was amphoteric. The reaction of chitin and cuticle to stains as shown by a study of the buccal mass
of Jorunna is not in agreement with the results gained by YoncE in the decapod
Crustacea.
