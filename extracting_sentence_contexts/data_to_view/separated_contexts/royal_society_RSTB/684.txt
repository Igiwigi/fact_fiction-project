Here we find that the already
liberated leaf-trace bundles, c’, of fig. 5, are much more prominent objects than the
projections, c, of the same figure.§

Before tracing the further course of these foliar bundles we must consider the
condition of the cortex in these young branches. One special fact connected with
an individual bundle of fig. 1 will be referred to later on. Immediately investing, and in contact with, the periphery of the primary tracheal
cylinder, we have clear evidence of an extremely delicate thin-walled parenchymatous
tissue, which will be again considered on describing some vertical sections of these
young twigs.
