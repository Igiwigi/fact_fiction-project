parameters ag, a; and dKy/dT are free parameters that can be varied for the fit of the P-V-T
data. In our analysis, however, we fixed a1(T) using the ambient pressure thermal expansion
measurements of ByC reported elsewhere [26] and refined ap since the two parameters are
observed to be highly correlated. In all cases, we weighted the observed variables P, V, T by their
statistical variances also reported in the SM.

In conclusion, we present P-V-T data for laser-heated ByC in the pressure 0.1-50 GPa range
and temperatures between 1000 and 2500 K. The use of MgO as the in situ pressure sensor made
it possible to estimate thermal pressure and the data obtained could be fit with a Berman P-V-T
equation of state as well as a Mie-Griineisen—Debye thermal model. In variance with several
dynamic pressure studies, ByC remains structurally stable in this P-T range, only displaying the
previously reported relaxation at 10 GPa (and at ambient temperature) which is accompanied by
a monotonic reduction of the axial ratio. This is best exemplified by the fact that only a single

Figure 5. Results of the Berman fit [28] of the P-V-T data using EosFit7c [29]. The thermal expansion parameters and dK/d7
were varied while the 300 K parameters for Vo, Ky and K,’ were held fixed to the values listed in table 1 and depicted in figure 1.
The data displayed here are clubbed into different isotherms assuming a spread of +250 K for ease of representation while the
