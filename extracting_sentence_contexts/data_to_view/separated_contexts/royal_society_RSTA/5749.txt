1. Introduction and summary: phenomenological motivation

The standard concordance model of cosmology (also known as ACDM (cosmological-constant
(A)-cold-dark-matter paradigm)) [1] works very well in describing the large-scale structure of
the Universe, being in excellent agreement with a plethora of diverse cosmological observations,
namely Supernovae Snla, cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) and gravitational lensing studies [2]. The data point towards the fact that the current-
epoch energy density of the Universe consists of 4.9% baryonic matter, 26.8% dark (gravitating)
matter and 68.3% a mysterious dark energy component, dominant at late eras (corresponding
to redshifts z <1), which is held responsible for the accelerating expansion of the Universe,
in a form compatible with the addition of a positive cosmological constant A in Einstein’s
general relativity (GR) theory (de Sitter space-time).! On the other hand, several single-field
models of inflation [4] have been falsified using CMB data [2]. In this respect, the Starobinsky
model of inflation [5], which is due to nonlinear, higher-order-in-(scalar)-curvature corrections to
GR, induced by quantum (conformal, ‘trace’) anomalies in effective field theories of (massless)
matter in the early universe, seems to fit excellently the pertinent data [2], provided one fixes
the coefficient of the (anomaly induced) higher-curvature corrections.
