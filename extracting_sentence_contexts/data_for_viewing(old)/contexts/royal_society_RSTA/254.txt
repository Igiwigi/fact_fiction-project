about the technical names for things, or definitions memorised by rote.

This is deeply unfortunate. Although many areas of science are extremely well
understood, a lot of the topics that have attracted public attention in recent
imes lie at or beyond the frontiers of the currently known: might GM crops
aybridize with other plants to create superweeds; how soon might stem cell
research lead to major medical benefits; to what extent might a generic H5N1
vaccine provide protection if and when avian flu becomes transmissible among
aumans; and much more.

Much, perhaps most, of scientific advice to government policy makers is routine,
yased on well-explored areas of science. When this happens, public expectations
‘tell us the facts’—can be fulfilled. To the contrary, there are many topics of
concern, both currently and in the recent past, which lie in areas where there is
still significant scientific uncertainty. When this happens, it is essential that we
understand and acknowledge that science is as much a way of asking illuminating,
testable questions, as it is a collection of tidy and certain answers.

It is easy to say there are areas of science where assured answers can be given,
and on the other hand areas where uncertainty still reigns. The critical question,
however, then becomes: who decides whether a given question lies in the area of
certainly or uncertainty? Or, more accurately, who decides where along the usua
continuum, from initially recognizing a problem to eventually having a fairly
confident understanding of it, we lie at any particular time. All this leads to the
antecedent problem: who decides the deciders?
