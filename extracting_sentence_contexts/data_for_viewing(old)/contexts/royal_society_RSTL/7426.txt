Passing now to the Anguillulide, I may state as the result of many experiments with
these, that the power they possess of repairing injuries seems very low. I have cut off
portions of the posterior extremity of the body of Enoplus communis, and though T have?
watched the animal for days after could never recognize any attempt at repair. And, as a
general rule, when the bodies of any of the larger marine species are severed, both fragy'
ments of the body will continue to move for from three to five days, though during this
time neither of the cut extremities shows the slightest signe of repair. For the last day
or two the fragments move only when irritated, and finally they cease to respond even‚Äù
when roughly touched. Within twenty-four hours of this time their bodies may be seen

$ It secms possible that in some cases the anterior half of the body may survive much longer from a cons
deration. of the following facts. On April 5, 1864, I found in a wide-mouthed bottle containing salt water and
a yery 8mall quantity of a filamentous green seaweed, the anterior balf of a specimen of Oncholarmus vulgarity
quite active in its movements, though presenting no traces of repair. Tt seems almost certain that the injury
to this animal must have been done on or before the 24th of the preceding month (March), since the water and

weed were put into the bottle on that day, and had not been interfered with in the meanwhile. Neither wero
there any larger animals in the bottle capable of biting the Oncholaimus in two.
