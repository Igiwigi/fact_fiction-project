The broad deciduous molar teeth were still in place (coloured red). On
removing part of the alveolar wall, the calcified crowns of their snccessors (coloured blue)
were seen, the upper one less advanced than the lower, and, as in the other genera
described, placed rather anteriorly to the tooth it was destined to sueceed. The form
of the crowns of these reserve teeth was quite different from their molariform prede-
cessors, being in fact that of the third premolars of the adult (Plate XXX. fig. 5),

The true molars had begun to take their place in the jaw, two in the maxilla and
four in the mandible on each side, having their crowns calcified. Except those men-
tioned above no traces of reserve or successional teeth were seen. We thus find in this American family of Marsupials precisely the same peculiarity in
the snccession of the teeth as noticed in their Australian congeners.
