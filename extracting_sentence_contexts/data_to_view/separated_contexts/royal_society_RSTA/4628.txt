The resulting conclusion that the change on heating is gradual is further
borne out by the appearance of the heating-curves of these alloys. These are not
reproduced, since they show nothing well defined ; apparently the change on heating
is very gradual and is therefore spread out over a wide range of temperature, merely
producing slight slopes in the various curves. Another fact which appears to be connected with the same properties of the
substances involved is found in the alloys lying between 8 and 16 per cent. of tin. In these alloys the temperature at which the evolution of heat occurs on cooling
depends upon the time for which they have been exposed to a temperature of 175Â° C.,
i.e., the alloys which have been kept at that temperature for six weeks show the
arrest-point at a lower temperature than those which have only been kept hot for
four weeks, while these in turn show the arrest-points at lower temperatures than
those which have been simply slowly cooled from the molten state ; still more rapidly-
cooled alloys show the point at still higher temperatures.
