The first impression is, that they must be connected with the reproductive masses ; but _
in what way and what physiological sense? Tt has already been demonstrated that the
ovaria and testes respectively, in their several segments, are anatomically developed from
the ciliated tubes. But this fact throws no light upon the use of the tubes themselyes. Ts
it possible that they can act as the conduits by which the generative products are con-
veyed into the perigastric cavity? No, it is not possible, for the cilia by which the tubes
are lined act in the reverse direction, tending rather to carry outwards, and that with
great force,. any body that may perchance be thrown into the channels of the tubes.
This fact is sustained by another fact, viz. that in Nats and Lumbricus neither the ova
nor the sperm-cells have ever, under any circumstances, been discoyered in the general
cavity of the body. On these and other grounds it is then probable that the augmented
size of the ciliated tubes in the © generative region ” may be ascribed to two causes: 1st, to
the fact that they are the roots from which the ovarian and testicular masses arise; and,
2nd, that by means of their open ciliated ends, they may effect the discharge of a larger
quantity of the cavitary fluid from the segments in which they are situated ; and the more
rapid elimination of this fluid from this region is most probably concerned in the more
energetic nutrition characteristic of the generative segments®.

Hirudinei.—The segmental organ in the Leech tribe exists under very readily demon-
strated conditions. Two genera of this family will be here selected for the purposes of
illustration, viz. the common officinal Leech (Sanguisuga medicinalis), and the Sea Leech
