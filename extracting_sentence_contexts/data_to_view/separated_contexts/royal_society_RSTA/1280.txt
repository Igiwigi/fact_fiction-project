The points on these lines represent actual
values estimated from the electrical tank. Reference to this figure shows that the
stream-lines were plotted in the tank to a distance of 0-015 chord from the nose. The
shape near the aerofoil was then determined from the fact that each line must meet the
surface at right angles. It was found by trial that there is very little latitude when
fixing the shape of a stream-line at the aerofoil surface, and that uncertainties in the
