whereas material taken several hours after egg-laying or while the egg is in the
albumen region, contains apical cells devoid of granules. No granules have been
noted in a specimen which atypically retained a completed egg until a second egg
had commenced shell membrane formation.

The granules usually lie in the cytoplasm adjacent to the Golgi apparatus or
between it and the nucleus. After Da Fano silver impregnation, the granules stain
clearly with iron hematoxylin, gz, fig. 31a, Plate 20. During active shell secretion,
they may fill the cytoplasm and extend to the ciliated cell membrane. Here, they
appear to pass through the latter and to accumulate as a granular material entangled
in the cilia, gv and gx, fig. 28, Plate 19. The granules are variable in size and
frequently clump together as they leave the cell. The basal epithelial cells do not
possess these granules during shell secretion. In fact, the epithelium as a whole
consists of ciliated cells with an apical nucleus, about which deeply staining granules
are grouped, alternating with basal cells, which appear to be in a state of rest.
An interesting example of excessive secretory activity in the apical cells is illustrated
in fig. 34, Plate 21. The darkly staining nuclei serve to mark out an area, ep, as a
distinct patch amongst the more normal epithelial cells.

(ii) Vacuole formation in the basal cells—After completion of the calcification of the
egg shell and the disappearance of secretory phenomena in the apical cells, the
basal cells undergo characteristic changes. They enlarge and partly compress
