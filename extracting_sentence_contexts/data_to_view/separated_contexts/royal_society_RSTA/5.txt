It has been recognized that, in general, bodies
need not have natural reference configurations in space, and, as such, they should be represented

mathematically as differentiable manifolds. The notion of a body point makes sense because of the : =
principle of material impenetrability which implies that the configurations of a body in space are : Sy
assumed to be embeddings. In fact, as early as [2], the configurations of a body in space were a
described as charts on the body manifold. We will refer to this point of view of continuum aed
mechanics as the Lagrangian approach. 22

A basic notion of force theory in continuum mechanics is the concept of the stress tensor. : Sg
The mathematical proof of existence of stress, the assumptions needed for the proof and the DNS

(e.g. [2-10]. In the standard continuum mechanics literature, the existence of stress is proved on
the basis of what is referred to as Cauchyâ€™s postulates, or mathematically equivalent assumptions.
