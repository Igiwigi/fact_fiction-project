$ An Account of the regular Gradation in Man, and in different Animals and Vegetables. By Cnarras
Wurrs. London, 1799. 4to. He says in the conclusions deducible from the facts and observations stated in
the second part of this essay, p. 83;

** Taking the European man as a standard of comparison on the one hand, and the tribe of Simiz on the
other, and comparing the claszes of mankind with the standards and with each other, they may be s0 arranged

European standing at the head, as being furthest removed from the brute creation.

* That the African, more especially in those particulars in which he differs from the European, approaches

* That the characteristics which distinguish the African from the European are the same, differing only in
degree, as those which distinguish the Ape from the European.”
