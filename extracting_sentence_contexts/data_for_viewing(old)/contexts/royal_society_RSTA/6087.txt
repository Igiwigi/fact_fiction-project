Subject Areas: time/gravity would be required? Finally, we would
astrophysics, cosmology, relativity, like to raise the fundamental question: How does the

Universe physically expand? Since there does not lie
anything outside into which it can expand, instead it
has to expand on its own—maybe by creating new
space-time out of nothing at each instant and at every
location! Thus not only was the Universe created at
constant, vacuum energy, cosmology and some instant in the past marking the beginning in
universe, quantum gravity the Big Bang, it is in fact being created continuously
at each epoch as it expands. We thus need quantum
theory of space-time/gravity for fully understanding
the working of the Universe.
