HSP60/GroEL heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been studied for many years

and HSP110 HSP/chaperone protein families have been found to be ‘moon-
lighting proteins’. Moonlighting proteins comprise a subset of multifunctional
proteins in which one polypeptide chain exhibits more than one physiologically
relevant biochemical or biophysical function [1]. In this class of multifunctional
proteins, the multiple functions are not due to gene fusions or multiple proteo-
lytic fragments. Several hundred moonlighting proteins have been identified,
and they include a diverse set of proteins with a large variety of functions [2].

Among the first proteins to be recognized as performing two very different
functions in the same organism were the taxon-specific crystallins. Crystallins
make up a large part of the lens of the eye, and about a dozen are identical
