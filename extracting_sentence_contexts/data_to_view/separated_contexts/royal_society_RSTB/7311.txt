in diameter already contain a considerable proportion of yolk,
but the largest yolky eggs found were not more than 5:0 mm. in diameter. It is probable
that this is the maximum size attained by the ova before discharge from the ovary, for it
appears to be impossible for anything larger to pass through the finer ramifications of the
internal cavity. The correctness of this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the lumen
in the infundibular part of the oviduct is not greater than 2-0 to 3-0 mm. in diameter, so
that an egg even of the small size mentioned would undergo considerable distortion in
passing through it. The wall of this part of the oviduct is thick, fibrous and inelastic, so that
unless great changes take place in it at the period of ovulation the eggs almost certainly
cannot be larger when discharged.
