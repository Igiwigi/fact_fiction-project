have a long-term detrimental impact on a womanâ€™s health. occur frequently. In post-menopausal Korean women, for

instance, higher parity and a longer duration of breastfeeding
was indeed associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis [33].
By contrast, a meta-analysis based mostly on white women
not only did not detect increased risks of osteoporosis, but
actually showed a decreased osteoporotic fracture risk associ-
ated with increasing parity of up to five live births [34]. While
bone mineral density does indeed decrease during pregnancy
and lactation (owing to increased calcium demands), an
increased load on the bones as a result of higher body
weight in pregnancy, carrying the infant, and higher physical
activity during childrearing do, in fact, stimulate an
increase in bone density. Thus, long-term effects, such as
the risk of osteoporosis, depend on many factors, including
diet during and after reproduction, and type, duration and
intensity of physical activity [35].

Older mothers, especially those with high parity, have increa-
sed risks of complications during pregnancy and during
delivery. Data from 29 countries documented higher frequency
for obstetric complications, including anaemia, post-partum
haemorrhage, fetal malpresentation and a higher risk of
