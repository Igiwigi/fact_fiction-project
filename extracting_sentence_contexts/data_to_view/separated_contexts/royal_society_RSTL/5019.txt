This shows, that when

EN function is complete, or the amplitude is a right angle, the amplitude of the
gderived function will be two right angles.
& When the s$pherical parabola approximates to a great circle of the sphere, the
Zecond focus F, will approach to F the immoveable focus. The arc RF, will, there-
Sfore, approach to coincidence with the arc RF, or the angle » will approximate to ,
S80 that q=p +»=2p nearly. 8g This is the geometrical explanation of the analytical fact observed in this theory. that when the modulus diminishes, or the spherical parabola approximates to a great
circle of the sphere, the ratio of any two successive amplitudes approximates to that
of two to one. When the transverse arc of the spherical parabola is a right angle and a half,
