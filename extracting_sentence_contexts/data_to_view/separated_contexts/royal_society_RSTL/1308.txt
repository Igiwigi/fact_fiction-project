It appears extraordinary, that under these circumstances,
notwithstanding the circulation through the placenta must
have been more languid than is natural, that organ should
nevertheless have been capable of exercising its proper func-

fions, 50 as to produce those changes on the blood, which are
necessary for the maintenance of foetal life. This may be
explained by considering that in the natural foetus the umbi-
Jical arteries are branches of the general arterial system, and
only a portion of the blood of the child is sent to the placenta,
whereas in the foetus which I have described, the trunk of the
vena cava was continued into the vein of the chord, and the
whole of the venous blood circulated through the placenta,
and was exposed to the influence of the arterial blood of the
mother,

But the most interesting circumstance, which we learn from
this examination is, that the circulation not only can be car-
ried on without a heart, but that a child- so circumstanced can
be maintained in its growth, so as to attain the same size as
a foetus which is possessed of that organ. This fact is con-
trary to what prior experience has. led us to expect, as will
appear from the following abstract of the authenticated cases
of this species of malformation, which we find on record. A monster, in which there was no heart, is described by
M. Mzry.* There were twins, one of which was well formed,
and of the usual size of a six month's child : the size of the
other was not mentioned, s0 that no comparison could be
made between them.
