The southward spreading of this oxygen- and carbon-rich water mass is
thought to prevent large-scale hypoxia in the North Atlantic and store anthropogenic carbon
away from the atmosphere for hundreds of years [1,2]. Thus, understanding how LSW spreads
into the deep North Atlantic and how this might change in the future is a critical component of
understanding our changing climate. The fact that LSW spreads into the deep Atlantic was suggested by Wiist [3], who observed a
core of high oxygen waters at about 2000 m depth focused at the western boundary. After World
War II, Stommel and Arons developed a theory for a Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC)
along which waters such as LSW could spread [4]. The existence of this current was confirmed by
the coordinated hydrographic and float measurements of Swallow & Worthington [5].
