THE FIBRES OF THE POSTERIOR ROOTS OF SOME SPINAL NERVES. 735

ConcLusIons.

When the facts of the above arrangement are compared with those found to exist
in the Frog (v. supra, p. 652, &c.), it will be seen that considerable differences between
the two schemes of distribution become apparent. It seems well to return to the con-
clusions arrived at for Rana, and examine the extent of their applicability to Macacus.

1, Although in a plexus each spinal nerve-root affords separate contributions to
many several nerve-trunks in the plexus, the cutaneous distribution of the root is
composed, not of patches which are disjoined, but of patches which are so joined that

Athe distribution of the entire root forms one continuous field.
a Looking over the areas determined for Macacus in the foregoing experiments, it is
Qseen that, just as in the leg of the Frog, so with the nerve-roots of the trunk and
Slower limb of WM. rhesus, each root possesses a single undivided field of cutaneous
