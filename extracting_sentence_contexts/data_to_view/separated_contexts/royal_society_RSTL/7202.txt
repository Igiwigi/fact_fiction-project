RecxavLr abstained
from enclosing at the same time a sufficient quantity of water in the tube to promote the circulation, because
in that case the thermal action of the solid was only a fraction of that of the water added, on which the entire
source of error falls, ReGxavur found als (ibid. p. 142) that in immersing anhydrous baryta, strontia, and lime
in most carefully dehydrated oil of turpentine, there is xuch a thermal action that no useful result is to be obtained
by his method for these oxides.

+ To the examples already known, which show what influence temperature exerts on the quantity of air
absorbed in a porous body, Rx6xavLr has added a very instructive one (Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. [3] vol. Ixiii. p. 32). If amorphous boron, formed into disks by pressure in a steel mortar, was strongly cooled and then
immersed in the water of the calorimeter (at the mean temperature), 80 considerable a disengagement of

absorbed air was produced, that Recxavir was compelled to give up the determination of the specific heat
by this method,

siderable for porous charcoal (in fact PoviLLet's experiments make this probable).
'This source of error is excluded in my method.

20. -In order to appreciate the trustworthiness of the results arrived at by my mode
of experiment, it is important to state with what amount of accuracy the data of obser-
vation and the ancillary magnitudes were determined. I will give this statement in what
now follows. For observing the temperature of the water in the calorimeter I used thermometers
made by GEISsLER of Bonn, which the kindness of Professor Buy, Director of the Phy-
ical Cabinet in Giessen, placed at my disposal.
