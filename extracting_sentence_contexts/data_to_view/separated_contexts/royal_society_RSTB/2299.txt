ESCOMBE ON STATIC DIFFUSION OF

tion is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the carbon dioxide in the moving
air. The correspondence of the ratios of tension and of absorption when the carbon
dioxide is lower than the normal amount of about 2Â°6 parts per 10,000, is very close
indeed. The same degree of correspondence is not maintained with the higher con-
centrations, a fact due to the air current in these cases not having been sufficiently
rapid to give the maximum absorption possible. With the experience gained with the above apparatus a much smaller and more
convenient one was constructed which admitted of much higher velocities of air
current, and had the extra advantage that it was not necessary to transfer the soda
solutions to another vessel for titration. This simple apparatus is shown in fig. 8b.
