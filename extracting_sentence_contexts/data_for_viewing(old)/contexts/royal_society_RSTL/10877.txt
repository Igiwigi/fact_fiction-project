spectrum, spectrum 10, Chart II., the third band being only visible by daylight, This
third band is nob constaub ; in other 8imilar solutions from grass I failed to see it.
The two first bands read : X 490-5 to A 470; 2nd, A 458'5 to A 445(?). On treating
the solid residue from this solution with iodine in iodide of potassium it became green,
with nitric acid dirty green, and with sulphuvic acid green and slaty-blue. A
chloroformic solution of the yellow residue showed three distinct bands, two of which
read : 18t, X 501 to A 481; 2nd, A 467 to \ 451 (?). A bisulphide of carbon s0Jution
showed only two distinct bands : 1st, X 5215 to x 4985; 2nd, A 488 to A 470.

An attempt to obtain the needle-shaped erystals of chlorophyll yellow only partially
Succeeded,

* It is a remarkable fact that the decompoxability of vegetable chlorophyll differs very much in
different cases. I often failed to bring about this change with caustic soda in similar 8olutions, which
also causes precipitation in 8nch solutions. Cf. Dracexvorer's © Plant Analysis,” 2nd Eng. ed., 1584,
P- 114, note; here it is shown that possibly the chlorophyll may exis in different states of com-
bination in plants.

- + Poxsibly two bands may have been formed ; note the above readings; this appearance also varies yery
much in different cages. I frequently noticed a narrow dark band placed over a lighter one.

+ The diminution of the fluorescence by alkalies appears to be due to precipitation.
