ganglionic plate or lamina. This thickened and convex margin is already less sharp
and definite in fig. 76 than it was in fig. 74, But in fig. 75, from Specimen M,
it is only the anterior margin of the plate which is clearly defined as such. The
lateral margin, which here runs backwards at right angles with the anterior margin,
is now practically coincident with, and on surface-view indistinguishable from, the

medial limit of the parietal embryonic ccelom. In consequence of this, the presence
of a ganglionic cellular lamina in the sub-ectodermal plane is not at all suggested
by the appearances seen on examination im toto by transmitted light, as in fig. 75.
But it is nevertheless a fact that the entire oblong area under consideration is
occupied by cellular tissue which is, at least in part, of ectodermal origin, and
which represents in an imperfect fashion the non-marginal or pedicular portion ot
the ganglionic lamina representing the glossopharyngeus-vagus complex. This fact
will become clear during the subsequent consideration of the sectional anatomy
of the region. Comparison may even now be made with advantage between fig. 76
& and the sectional fig. 96, Plate 16, which represents a transverse section across the
hind-brain region of Specimen H, and shows the ganglionic plate representing the
8 vago-glossopharyngeal complex.

(c) Neuromerie Segmentation.

Both of the Specimens H and M show a much more definite neuromeric segmenta-
