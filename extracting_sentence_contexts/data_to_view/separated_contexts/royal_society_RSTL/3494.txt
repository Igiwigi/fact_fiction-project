'These experiments did not afford s0 complete a comparison as the former series,
because the intervals between the vertical ribs were not equal, nor in the same pro-
portion to the depth of metal, the effect of which would be to vary to some extent
the form of the curve of deflection. Nevertheless, they show in an equally decided
manner, that when the deflection is the same the resistance increases when the depth
of metal in the beam is increased. The foregoing experiments have therefore elicited three facts as regards beams
formed of two parallel bars separated at given interyals by vertical ribs :—


IN BEAMS SUBJECTED TO TRANSVERSE STRAIN. 233

First, that in every case the resistance, or the value of F, is greater than that due
to the tensile resistance of the metal. Secondly, that with the same depth of metal in the beam, and the same distance of
bearing, the resistance is greater when the deflection is greater. Thirdly, that with the same deflection and the same length of bearing, the resist-
ance is greater when the depth of metal in the beam is greater.
