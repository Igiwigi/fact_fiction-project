I find that glycogen may be kept in the presence of lactic acid, of considerably
greater strength than is found in the post-mortem liver, for two days without under-
going any change. a

On the third day a slight reduction with Fenuixe may occur. Tubes inoculated
from the flask gave no growth of micro-organisms, so the action could only have been
due to the acid. If the acid is boiled with glycogen, a similar slight reduction is got
after twelve hours. 4

From these facts it seems highly improbable that the presence of the organic acids |
can have any action in the late hepatic amylolysis. ‘To determine this point the
following experiment was performed. :

Exrerment 39. 10.5.93. :

A rabbit, which had on the previous day thrown a litter of young, was killed at 11.35 au. In-
excising the liver the animal’s skin, the hands, instruments, scale pan, &c., were well washed with per-

chloride of mercury, and then with methylated spirit. The liver was not allowed to come in contact —

with the skin of the animal or with any body not sterilized.
