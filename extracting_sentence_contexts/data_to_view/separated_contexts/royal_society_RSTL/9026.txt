Or, to state the same thing in the words previously used,
we have conclusive proof that, so far as their function is concerned, these radial linegpf
differentiated tissne are undistinguishable from what we elsewhere know as afferent
nerves. But although these tracts of differentiated tissxwue thus far resemble afferent,
nerves in their function, we s0on see that in one important particular they differ widely
from such nerves; for we have seen that, after they have been divided, stimulation of
their peripheral parts still continues to be transmitted to their central parts, as shown
by the non-localizing movements of the polypite. Of course this transmission cannot
take place through the divided tissue-tracts themselves ; and hence the only hypothesis
we can frame to account for the fact of its occurrence is that which would suppose these
tissue-tracts, or afferent lines, to be capable of vicarious action. Such vicarious action
would probably be effected by means of intercommunicating lines, the directions of which
would probably be various. In this way we arrive at the hypothesis of the whole con-
tractile sheet being pervaded by an intimate plexus of functionally differentiated tissue,
the constituent elements of which are capable of vicarious action in a high degree (se
