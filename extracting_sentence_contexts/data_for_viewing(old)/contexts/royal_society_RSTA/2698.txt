case, the true physical origin of the so-called asperities needs further careful examination.

Large events of the present 2D model tend to be unilateral, with its epicentre lying at the rim
of the rupture zone. In fact, the epicentre of the target event is located just next to the rim of the
rupture zone of some past event, the rupture propagating away from the rupture zone of that past
event. Hence, the events of the 2D model are of type-I in the terminology of [40]. In the recurrence
of large events, while there is a characteristic recurrence time, an immediate recurrence of large
events in the form of twin events is also possible.

Event-size distributions such as the magnitude distribution and the rupture-length
distribution were also studied. The event-size distributions of the 2D model exhibit behaviours a
bit different from those in 1D. It exhibits a GR-like power-law behaviour for smaller magnitudes,
which changes over to a more characteristic behaviour for larger magnitudes. In fact, such a
change of behaviour, i.e. the GR law holding for smaller magnitudes but a significant deviation
from the GR law at larger magnitudes, has been reported also in real seismicity [55-57].

The computed rupture-length distribution also exhibits some difference between in 1D and 2D.
In particular, the maximum rupture length L;,max is considerably longer in 1D than in 2D. Indeed,
while L;,max ~ 300 — 400 in 2D as can be read off from figure 5, it reaches Ly max ~ 1000 — 1500 in


1D. Presumably, the non-trivial geometry associated with the rupture propagation in large events
in 2D causes such a difference.

In summary, by performing extensive numerical simulations on the 2D BK model obeying the
