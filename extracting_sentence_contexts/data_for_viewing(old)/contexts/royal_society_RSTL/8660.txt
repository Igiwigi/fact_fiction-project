Next day (April 8) at 12 noon it was taken out of its cage, and the left eye bandaged

on the perch. Retired from the perch when I approached making mouths.

Vision therefore had returned in the right eye.

The subsequent history and post mortem examination of this animal will be found on
Þ- 461 # $eq. under the head of Exp. XV.

This experiment completely confirms the former two as to the fact of blindness being
caused in one eye on the destruction of the angular gyrus of the opposite hemisphere.

The important fact noted in Exp. VII. is also confirmed, viz. that within a very
short period visual perception becomes again possible with the same eye, notwith-
standing the lesion.

The next experiment relates to the effects of destruction of the angular gyrus on both
sides.

Experiment X.
