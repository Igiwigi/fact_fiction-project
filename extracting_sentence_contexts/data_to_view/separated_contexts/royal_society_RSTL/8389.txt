exhibits their appearance under such powers. In many instances we see that the cells
in these latter sections appear to be almost cubical; but, owing to their limited number
in each ray, and the consequent absence of mutual pressure, their sides are more turgid
and their general aspect less mural than in other examples of Coal-measure plants. This
difficulty in tracing the details of their form is further increased by the fact that their
vertical divisions frequently coincide with those of the vessels, owing to the dimensions
of the two being correspondent in the radial direction. Nevertheless there is no real
difficulty in demonstrating that these organs exhibit substantially the ordinary structure
and arrangement of exogenous medullary rays. I have already stated that the vascular elements of these stems differ from those of
the Oldham plant, in consisting wholly of barred yessels instead of reticulated ones.
