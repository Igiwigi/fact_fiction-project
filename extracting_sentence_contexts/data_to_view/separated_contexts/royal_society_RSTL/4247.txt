Trans. 1837, Part I. p. 78. Sincapore.â€”A very large diurnal inequality,
high water heights, diurnal inequaiity = 14 ft. Low water heights, diurnal inequa-
lity = 6 ft. The age of the diurnal inequality is a day and a quarter. This very large diurnal inequality in the low water heights of Sincapore was, 80
far as I know, a new fact, when it was thus extracted from the observations, and was
probably looked upon by most persons as a singular case. There is however good
reason to believe that the same fact extends oyer the whole of the sea in that region. At least I have the means of showing that it prevails on the north coast of Australia,
namely, at Port Essington.
