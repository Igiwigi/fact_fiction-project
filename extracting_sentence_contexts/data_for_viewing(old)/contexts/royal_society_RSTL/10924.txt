Plate 9, figs. 31 and 32, show the relative effects of solutions of 1 to 3,000 caustic
soda solution (Plate 9, fig. 31) and caustic potash solution (Plate 9, fig. 32) upon
resting musele. The tracings were taken upon a slowly revolving cylinder. Each
centimeter of the tracing represents 5”. The lever, which multiplies fourteen times,
© exercises a constant traction of 10 grms. on the muscle. Fresh solution was added
where stars are placed in the course of the curve. It will be seen that the shortening
effect produced by caustic soda in 50”, during which the solution was renewed every
10”, is slightly greater than is the case with the companion muscle treated with
caustic potash of the same strength. The curves, however, show a very close similarity
throughout. The commencing relaxation caused by the snbstitution of 1 to 1,000
Auctic acid is een in each case.
A The very gradual shortening of the muscle upon the firs6 application of potash
gnd soda is, to some extent, due to the fact that the muscles had been previously
Surarized. When curara has not been previously employed the first application of
dilute solutions causes a more rapid primary contraction, though the total effect of
She application may not be greater, if as great as in the curarised muscle. Plate 9,
Ag. 33, gives the effect of a stronger solution of s0da, 4.e., 1 to 2,500, and the 8ub-
-Zequent relaxation it undergoes upon the application of 1 to 500 lactic acid,
5 Plate 9, figs. 34 and 35, give the action of soda 1 to 4,000, and potash 1 to 6,000,
ith partial relaxation consequent to lactic acid. That lactic. acid itself causes
Ho if of a certain strength, is shown in Plate 9, fig. 36, when 1 to 1,000
olution of the acid causes in 25" a g8hortening of 4 millims. in the curve, or of
B millim, in the muscle.
£ The application of potash reduces this shortening to some extent, and then, its
wn action being no longer balanced, causes the muscle to contract rapidly. The
