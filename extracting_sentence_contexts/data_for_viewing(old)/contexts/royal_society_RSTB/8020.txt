vagina, the former in the Indian and the latter in the African elephant. Watson then
dissected a female Indian elephant, which he described in 1881, and found a condition
differing from all previous accounts (see p. 115). In fact, the structure he found has not
been reported in any other specimen. Assuming this specimen to be normal, he wrote:
‘There are few (mammals) in which the vagina, in respect of anatomical structure,
presents so close a resemblance to the uterus as does that of the elephant.’ In a second
specimen, however, which was of normal configuration, Watson (1883) found the vagina
quite clearly distinguishable. In the present investigation it was always found possible to
insert the hand from the cavity of the vagina, when that organ was cut across in sztu, into
that of the urogenital canal. There is therefore no reason to suppose that the vagina is not
normally used in copulation in the elephant. As for the comparison with the hyena in this
particular respect, which was taken up by Neuville, a later paper by Matthews (1939) has
made it clear that the vagina of the hyena is in fact distinguishable from the uterus, both
morphologically and histologically, and that here again there is no reason to suppose it is
not functional in coitus.

(2) The development of the ovarial sac

The structure of the ovarial sac of the adult elephant has been briefly described above
(p. 112, figure 5). The most comprehensive account of the comparative morphology of the
peritoneal structures in the region of the ovary of mammals is that of Zuckerkandl (1897),
who showed that the form of the sac varies within each order of mammals, while in some
cases the same form of sac appears in members of several different orders. In general, the
ovarial sac is formed by the mesosalpinx, or ala vespertilionis. This is that portion of the
broad ligament in which the Fallopian tube is suspended from the body wall. The tube
