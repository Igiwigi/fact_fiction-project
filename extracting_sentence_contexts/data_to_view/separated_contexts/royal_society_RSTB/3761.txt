Mr. F. J. Bennerr (13), ina paper on calcification in the teeth, says :
“ Nowhere, as far as I know, does direct experiment favour the globular form as a
possible arrangement of the lime salts in the teeth.” No doubt it is very difficult,
perhaps impossible, to reproduce by experiment the exact conditions in living
organisms, but this does not necessitate the abandonment of the view that lime salts
are deposited in the dental tissues in this form. In the present paper I have not
supposed that any experiment out of the body can exactly reproduce the natural
process, but I think the general principles on which the physical process of calcific
deposit takes place are well shown by the experiments of Rainey and Harrie, and
by the formation of calcified structures in the mollusca and crustacea,

I have, however, shown that calcospherites which exactly resemble many of the
forms artificially produced, wre found both in dentine and enamel, and we have to
meet this fact, and consider how it is that calcification does occur in this form, despite
the chemical composition of the finished tissues. I think we must look for an explanation in the composition of the enamel and
dentine in early stages of development, although unfortunately the difficulties in the
way of obtaining any reliable analysis of the first formed enamel and dentine appear
to be insuperable. Tt may, however, well be, as pointed out by Prof. Sums Woopneap (14) that, as in
the early stages of bone formation, the carbonates may be present in excess, In
speaking of bone, he says: “ Newly formed bones, or new bone-tissue of any kind,
where the cells are extremely active in building up the matrix, almost invariably have
a larger proportion of carbonate of lime than fully formed bones, because here the
active cells set free a larger proportion of carbonic acid, as a result of which more
phosphoric acid may be replaced by the carbonic acid lime salts.”
