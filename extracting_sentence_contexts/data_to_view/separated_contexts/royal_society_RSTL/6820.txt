I have already proved that undried atmospheric
air manifests an extraordinary opacity for the radiation from a hydrogen-flame, and from
this deportment I inferred the synchronisxm of the cold vapour of the air and the hot
Vapour of the flame. The vibrating-period of a molecule is, no doubt, determined by
the elastic forces which separate it from other molecules, and it is worth inquiring how
these forces are affected when a change 80 great as that of the passage of a vapour to a
liquid occurs. The fact established in the earlier sections of this paper, that the order
of absorption for liquids and their vapours is the same, renders it extremely probable

that the period of vibration is not materially affected by the change from vapour to
liquid ; for, if changed, it would probably be changed in different degrees for the
different liquids, and the order of absorption would be thereby disturbed*. The follow-
ing Table, in which the deportment of our eries of liquids towards the radiation from
a hydrogen-flame is recorded, will throw additional light upon this question ;—
