© * Hitherto we have only determined, by various methods, the value of the angle w, and thus obtained a
S linear relation between the three axes of the ellipsoid of induction. If, by considerations exceeding the
© limits of this paper, we should be enabled to get the ratio itself of these axes, we could hence deduce the form
of the magnetic particles of the examined erystal, supposing that, in fact, these particles are similar ellip-
s0ids, 8imilarly directed, all induced by the magnetic pole, but not sensibly inducing each other. Mr. W.
\ Trnonsox, however, has published a curious theorem, according to which a body of any exterior shape is
Li influenced by an infinitely distant pole like a certain ellipsoid whose axes are to be determined in each
4 eaze. Hence an infinite variety of forms corresponds to a known ellipsoid of induction. Again, each physical
pu condition of crystals leading to our ellipsoid of magnetic induction has, to the present time, independently
i of Pors80x's hypothetical views on matter, the same claim to be the law of nature. We may generally con-
| ceivean amorphous substance to consist of equal particles, pointing in all different directions, which by the
| act of crystallization become directed in the same way. But I think it probable we shall obtain the same
4  Fehults by admitting spherical particles, which, according to their different proximity along different direc-
© Hons within the crystal, will equally lead, by their mutual induction, to three axes of induction ; thus each
Such particle may possibly be acted upon in the 8ame way as our ellipsoidal particles.
