reality, his results supply an important confirmation of the third expression quoted
above, and Lorentz (1909) himself has quoted them for this purpose, though without
reference to the error in Magri’s paper which he has tacitly corrected.

Expression (1-1) was found by Newton to be reasonably true for many liquids when
the temperature was varied, and was partially based on deductions from the emission
theory of light. Laplace inferred the same expression from theoretical considerations
based on the form of the undulatory theory accepted in his time. Jamin (1856, 18572),
as a result of experiments on water and its vapour, considered that the law did not
hold when a change of state occurred, and since his time it has come to be regarded
merely as an empirical approximation.

Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical ex-
pression (1-2), which was propounded by Gladstone and Dale (1858, 1863) as the result
of experiments on water and carbon disulphide at different temperatures. Sutherland
(1889) has attempted to give a theoretical basis for this relation, though without much
success.

The third relation is probably the most interesting both theoretically and practically.
It was independently derived by L. Lorenz (1880), of Copenhagen, and H. A. Lorentz
(1936), of Amsterdam, from entirely different theoretical grounds, the former by con-
sidering the passage of light through ponderable media consisting of spherical molecules
immersed in an ether having the properties of an elastic solid, and the latter from his
own theory of electrons considered in relation to Maxwell’s system of equations for the
electromagnetic theory of light. Lorenz, Prytz and others have found it particularly
