Between these were placed alternating water
and saline solutions, increasing in strength towards one end. Slight movements of
the air-bubbles do occur when the fibre is moved, so that one end of an air-bubble is
brought alternately nearer to a saline solution than to water, and then further away. In addition, a flow of (coloured) water takes place along the vessel towards the
region of increasing concentration, but it is apparently independent of any action of
the air-bubbles, and is probably the direct result of the unavoidable osmotic action,
The water is able to pass the air-bubbles when these are stationary, a fact which has
already been observed by SrRasBuRGER in the tracheides of Conifers. +
In addition, observations were made upon living wood in situ by the following
means. A block of wood was chiselled out from a tree (pear, apple and elm), leaving
intact a strip of the superficial wood on one side.
