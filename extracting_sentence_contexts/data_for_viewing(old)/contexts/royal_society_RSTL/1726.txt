Trt extraordinary nature of the monotrematous quadrupeds of Australia
cannot be illustrated more forcibly than by observing that it is still doubtful
to what class of animals they properly belong. In the confines of the animal
kingdom, it is less surprising that a species should occasionally be discovered,
either 80 deyoid of external character, or of a form s0 strange, as to occa-
si0n a difficulty in ascertaining its class ; and an Entozoon, a Lernzea, or an
aggregate species of Salpa may require very minute investigation in order to
determine its relation eyen to the most comprehensive division of a methodical
arrangement. But the same difficulty occurring with respect to a hairy
quadruped, affords one of the most unexpected, as well as interesting pro-
blems in natural history, and renders acceptable the smallest addition to the
series of facts already ascertained respecting 80 anomalous a creature.

In this country we can hardly hope to throw light upon the economy of
Ornithorhynchus and Echidna, except by the way of anatomy : at least, the
aquatic habits of the former species render it improbable that it will ever be
brought alive to our menageries. But the same objection does not apply
to the spiny ant-eater, and it is to this animal therefore that the attention of
voyagers from New South Wales should be more especially directed with a
view of importation.

It is well known that one of the points now at issue with respect to these
animals, is the nature of certain glandular organs which they possess, which
are supposed to appertain to the mammary system : and it is obyious that our
