The hysteresis in the stretched wire, during removal and reapplication of the

- magnetising force, is greater than in the case of annealed pieces. Several other experiments of a similar kind have shown that the sloping curves of
fig. 14 are thoroughly characteristic of strained iron. In fact the difference between
them and the curves of magnetisation of an annealed specimen is 80 distinetly marked

Athat it is easy, by applying this magnetising test, to distinguish a piece which has
been strained beyond its limit of elasticity from a piece which has not been 0 strained. BZ A comparison of figs. 8 and 9 shows the same kind of difference between the curves
S for a stee] wire when annealed (fig. 9), and when in its commercial hard-drawn state
S(fig. 8). The operation of wire-drawing gives a strain which differs from that to
Swhich the iron wire was suhjected in the above experiment only in having lateral
Scompression combined with the longitudinal extension.
