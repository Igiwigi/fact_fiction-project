If, therefore, we suppose the coefficients to vary with
the time in the manner given by these equations, the value of x so obtained will be a
solution of equation (xvii.) for all time. Since the equations involve h, and h varies
with the time, one further equation is required before we can express the co-ordinates
at any time in terms of the initial values of the co-ordinates and the time. This
additional equation is supplied by the fact that N, the total number of molecules,
remains constant. MR. J.
