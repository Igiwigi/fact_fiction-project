with the lowest possible order in the weak interaction, i.e. k = 2:

(L) : + Lew (x) | . (3.14)

Equation (3.14) indicates that, beyond the very short-time expansion, i.e. (ty/N) <t < ty, the
dependence on ts becomes superseded by the diverging terms in the scale T2. This could lead to
the new time scale T3, which was seen experimentally to be tied to T2 as

T2 $13 Ktz. (3.15)

In that sense, T3 becomes characteristic of the complexity or ‘chaos’ of the many-spin system
that amplifies the small effect of the perturbation. In addition, it is important to stress that,
being an experimental fact, equation (3.15) corresponds to a system composed by infinitely many
interacting spins. In other words, equation (3.15) stands for the relations of time scales in the
thermodynamic limit. Quite on the contrary, any numerical simulation involves a finite, very
small indeed, number of spins where the irreversibility rate T; would be essentially given by
ts. Then, the LE decay rate evaluated in a finite system would ultimately be perturbation-
dependent [28]. Thus, our central hypothesis of irreversibility would mean that equation (3.15) is
an emergent property. It should rely on the thermodynamic limit, which implies taking the limit
N — o first, and then ty — oo. The non-uniformity of these limits plays a crucial role to yield
quantum phase transitions, as discussed in the context of Anderson localization [49-51].

The physical picture described above is schematically represented in figure 2. There, we
show the expected interplay between Myp(t) and Mx(t) leading to M;,:(t). Indeed, as stated in
equations (3.11) and (3.12), the very short-time dependence of both contributions is extensive in
