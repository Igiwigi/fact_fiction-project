The earthâ€™s magnetic field is more likely to account for
this effect. It will be noticed that the maximum velocity is apparently reduced by
the magnetic field. This is due to the fact that the paths of the electrons are so
curved that none of them strike the case normally. As long asa few electrons impinge
on the case normally the correct maximum velocity will be given. This was shown
in the following experiment.
