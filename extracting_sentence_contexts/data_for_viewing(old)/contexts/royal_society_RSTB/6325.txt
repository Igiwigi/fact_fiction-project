present in the gomphodont forms as in the gomphodont cynodonts.


142 TOOTH-REPLACEMENT IN THERIODONT REPTILES

A further, and very important problem, on which some light has been thrown, is
that of the possibly compound nature of mammalian teeth.

Bo.k studied the structure of the enamel organs of mammalian and reptilian
teeth, and came to the conclusion that the enamel organs of mammalian teeth are
compound. He reasoned—against the weight of palaeontological evidence—that
the teeth were therefore also compound, each being built up of two elements
homologous with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts there is
a true reptilian succession of complex teeth seems evidence against such a view.
But it is still possible to argue that the fusion of pairs of members of each family of
reptilian teeth could have taken place at an earlier stage, and thus these reptiles
also possessed ‘‘ dimer” teeth.

I am greatly indebted to Dr. W. D. Lane and Dr. W. E. Swinton of the British
Museum (Natural History) for the loan of the three specimens of Thrinaxodon
liorhinus in their charge, and to Professor D. M. S. Watson for the generous loan
of his Dimetrodon material and advice on the question of the restorations of Nythosaurus
and Thrinaxodon., And finally I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the
Balfour Managers for their sympathetic interest during my tenure of the Studentship,
particularly in regard to my expedition to the Ruhuhu Valley in Tanganyika.
