U” (sﬆy the U” coordinates), arising from the four eliminations respectively ; viz.:
4x6+4Xx6=48. And it will be found that the coefficients of the forms P, P', are
already comprised among those of U, U”; so that they do not add to the previous
total of forty-eight.

The number of identical relations established in the present paper is 34. Bub it will
be observed that the equations, UQ'—UP=0, are lineo-linear in the U coordinates

and in the TU” coordinates; and as we are concerned with the ratios only of the
coefficients and not with their absolute values, we are in fact concerned only with the
ratios of the U coordinates inter 8, and of the U” coordinates inter 8e, and not with
their absolute values. Hence the number of independent coordinates will be reduced
to 48—34—2=12, as it should be,

$ 1. Formation of the equations.

With a view to the problem in question, ib is first required to form the equations
of two quadrics having a generating line in common. For the present purpose the
following appears the simplest way of effecting this ; leb

u=ar+Py+yz+6t, u=ox+Py+y:+6%, ..... 0
v=a;z+Py+y2+81, vV=au+B'y+y.:+8'1,
