The sphere, therefore, acts on external particles precisely as an infinitely small magnet

of moment -- Cx Y*F held in the direction of the lines of force.

Here we may pause to observe the very remarkable fact that while the effect of a thin
rod or plate magnetized in a direction parallel to itself is nearly proportional to z, the
effect of a plate magnetized at right angles to its plane, or of a solid sphere, is almost
independent of the value of z,

Thus, taking WEBER's obseryations, the values of z for steel and soft iron are nearly
5 and 36, A soft iron rod or thin plate magnetized in the direction parallel to itself
would therefore haye more than seven times the effect of a steel rod or plate of the same
dimensions ; but in the case of spheres the proportion of the effects would be
