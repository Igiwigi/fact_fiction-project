non-CQ} gases, expressed in CO equivalence through a metric of choice, need to be compensated : a
by negative CO2 emissions. The choice of metric type and time horizon for calculation of CO2- iB

equivalent emissions will affect the magnitude of net negative emissions of CO2 needed to
produce net-zero CO2-equivalent emissions. Figure 4 uses N2O and CH, as representative long-
lived and short-lived non-CO) gases to demonstrate the effect of metric type and time horizon on
the required amount of net negative CO2 emissions needed to achieve a net-zero balance in terms
of CO2-equivalent emissions. GTP 199 gives substantially lower weight to methane emissions than
under GWP 09, and consequentially smaller amounts of net negative CO emissions are needed :Â£
than when considering GWP09. In general, metric choice affects the amount of negative CO?
emissions needed to balance residual CH4 emissions much more than for residual NO emissions.

This is due to the fact that N2O, like COz, is long-lived, so it can be compared against CO ina

much more like-for-like fashion leading to relatively little variation in values between the different

metrics.

As the physical consequences of net-zero balance will depend on the choice of metric,
it is important to evaluate to what extent differing metrics correspond to differing physical
consequences under maintained net-zero CO -equivalent emissions, for example, its global
temperature consequences. Figure 5 shows the evolution of global temperature relative to 2100
under the maintenance of net-zero emissions between CH4, N2O and CO emissions using
different metrics and time horizons. Emissions of CH4, N2O and (negative) RF due to other (non-
CO2/CH4/N20) climate forcers are held constant at 2100 values after 2100, with removals of CO2
