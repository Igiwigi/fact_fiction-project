of nitrate of so0da was chiefly in the Graminez, but considerable also in the Legu-
minose and in the miscellaneous herbage. As compared with the results obtained

with the double quantity of nitrate, the small total deficiency was chiefly in the

Syrasses, whilst there was, on the average, an increase in the amount of both the

Jeguminous and the miscellaneous species.
