If, however, the explanatory target does not depend on the
conditions that make the model apt, then we have no reason
to view the dependencies within the model itself (type 2) as a
partial story of the full dependencies of the explanatory


target. There is now no reason to take the internal dependencies postulation of some metaphysical asymmetric relation that El

This is not to deny that when the conditions which make models to physical facts is identified either from within the
