§10. The present state of knowledge concerning the general structure of nickel-iron
alloys of natural origin (omitting those :in which carbon, phosphorus, and other
elements are present in considerable quantity) can be summarised as follows :—

(1) Meteoric iron is, in general, homogeneous when it contains less than 7 per cent.
of nickel. (2) It is heterogeneous when the percentage of nickel lies between 7 and
14. (3) It becomes practically homogeneous again when the percentage of nickel
exceeds some value, apparently between 15 and 35 per cent., which could possibly be
fixed by further careful microscopic investigation. It is clear that these facts can be interpreted if we assume that the taenite (thin
layers of nickeliferous material), which appears when the percentage of nickel exceeds 7,
is a eutectic consisting of (1) “mixed crystals” containing about 7 per cent. of Ni,
and (2) “mixed crystals” containing the considerably higher percentage of Ni
corresponding to that at which the structure of the alloy again becomes homogeneous.
