extracranial rete (rather than a ‘rete externum’ in the terminology of Davis & Story 1943)
to distinguish it from the intracranial rete of the artiodactyls examined. Although most
of our findings agree with the account given by Davis & Story (1943), we have in no
specimen found the ‘rete internum’ described by these authors.

The carotid rete

The extracranial rete is a tightly packed network of interlacing arterial vessels through
which blood is transmitted from the external carotid arterial system to the circle of ’
Willis, to the orbit, and to the ethmoidal region of the nose (see figures 10 to 15).
The rete is wrapped around the internal maxillary artery as the latter crosses the medial
pterygoid muscle (figure 13). It is closely related to the branches of the trigeminal
nerve, and in fact the maxillary division of this nerve passes directly through it. The rete
is shaped like a pyramid, with a base situated antero-laterally, and three sides, forming
respectively an inferior, a supero-lateral, and a supero-medial surface.* The base is
concave and is closely applied to the muscle cone of the orbit, and the apex lies at the
origin of the rete from the internal maxillary artery. The inferior surface rests upon the
medial pterygoid muscle, the supero-lateral surface is adjacent to the temporalis muscle,
and the supero-medial surface lies immediately beneath the base of the skull.

The vessels which compose the rete are for the most part relatively uniform in calibre
(casts of these vessels measuring 200 to 300u in diameter). They are closely intertwined
and anastomose freely with one another (figures 13, 15). The whole structure lies in
a venous lake which receives blood from the orbital veins and cerebral sinuses and drains
through a venous plexus (the pterygoid plexus) into the facial and jugular veins.
