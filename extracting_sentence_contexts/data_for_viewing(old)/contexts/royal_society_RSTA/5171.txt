In the late 1950s, chromium (Z = 24) was proposed as an essential element. However there is no
reliable current evidence that chromium is essential. No natural proteins in the body are known
to contain Cr and there is no gene that can be said to code for it. Interest in the essentiality
of chromium began with the isolation of a chromium complex from extracts of brewers’ yeast
which enhanced the action of insulin in controlling normal levels of blood sugar [103]. However
this complex, so-called ‘glucose tolerance factor’, thought to contain Cr'll and nicotinate and
glutathione as ligands, was never fully characterized. Moreover, the glucose tolerance factor itself
was subsequently shown not to contain Cr [104].

There is still interest in the possible therapeutic effects of Cr, but its beneficial properties
still remain tentative. Today, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends a daily
adult intake of about 30 1g Cr per day, despite its essentiality being in question. Vincent recently
concluded that, in fact, Cr has been conclusively shown not to have beneficial effects on body
mass or composition and should be removed from the list of essential trace elements [105].

Cr'tris(picolinate) is widely marketed as a mineral supplement for weightloss and body-
building, although there is concern about possible damage to DNA [104]. CrV! (chromate) is
known to bea genotoxic carcinogen. The toxicity seems likely to arise from redox reactions in cells
which generate Cr’ 1,2-diolato species (carbohydrates, glycoproteins and sialic acid derivatives)


which can cause oxidative damage to DNA [29]. A recent study of CrY complexes with a variety
of monosaccharides and the model ligand cis-1,2-cyclopentanediol provided evidence of their
nuclease activity [29]. The CrY complexes can cause oxidative DNA damage without the presence
of added reductants or oxidants, supporting the participation of CrV 1,2-diolato complexes in the
