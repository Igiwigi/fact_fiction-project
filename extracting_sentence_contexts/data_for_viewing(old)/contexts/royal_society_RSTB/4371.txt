It is seen in fig. 22 that the impressions of the enamel prisms upon the clear
layer of the membrane are arranged in parallel lines, or strie. There seems little
doubt that the impressions so arranged indicate the structure of the enamel surface
which produces them, showing that the enamel is not smooth but is arranged in a
series of ridges produced by the outcrop of the enamel prisms.

These impressions appear to indicate the imbrication lines or lines of successive
deposit of the enamel, and are considered by most authors to represent the outcrop of
the striz of Retzius. It was shown by PickERtLL(12) that these imbrication lines
are constantly present in the enamel of healthy teeth, and he drew attention to the
fact that specimens of Nasmythâ€™s Membrane stained with silver nitrate showed a

imbrication. In fig. 22 the impressions of the individual prisms from beneath are.
clearly visible along these lines, which evidently here represent the summits of the
ridges.

In many parts of the membrane which have been floated off the enamel as before
