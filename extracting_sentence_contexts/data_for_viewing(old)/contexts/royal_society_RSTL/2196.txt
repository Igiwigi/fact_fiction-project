(The pebbles do not in reality move in straight lines, but in a snccession of curyes;
the straight lines are assumed here, and in other parts of this paper, to simplify the
description.)

I trust it is only necessary to remark, that if the wind continue to blow in the same
direction during the ebbing of the tide as through the flowing of it, the direction in
which the wayes will strike the shore will be nearly the same, and the progress of the
pebbles will be urged by a similar action, and therefore their direction will also be
the same,

In this action we obserye a constant tendency to heap up and accumulate the
shingles; and it is an interesting fact, that when the action has continued equally
through a tide, the pebbles are left in regular order, according to their dimensions, the
largest being uppermost, and the smallest at the bottom of the plane. I do not mean
to state that all the largest are at the top, or that all the smallest are at the bottom,
for it is evident that 8ome of every size will be found at eyery level; but that if an
equal measure (sy half a peck) be taken from the different levels, the average of
each specimen will exhibit in regular order the various dimensions.

The order in which the pebbles are thus found is, then, that by which the effect of
the waves is distinguished from that of a current, the effect of the latter consisting
only in its influence on the direction of the impinging and recoiling motions of the
waves, by which the motion of the beach may in a small degree be accelerated or
retarded.
