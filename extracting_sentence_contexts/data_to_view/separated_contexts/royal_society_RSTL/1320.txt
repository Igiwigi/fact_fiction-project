was $till Iess acted upon by phosphorus, and after an hour's
exposure to it, had scarcely diminished in quantity, but the
phosphorus had gained a tint of pale green. It did not combine with mercury, when they were heated
together. These circumstances are sufficient to shew, that the com-
bustible substance obtained from boracic acid by the agency
of potassium, is different from any other known species of
matter, and it seems, as far as the evidence extends, to be the
same as that procured from it by electricity ; and the two
series of facts, seem fully to establish the decomposition, and
recomposition of the acid. From the large quantity of potassium required to decom-
pose a small quantity of the acid, it is evident that the boracic
acid must contain a considerable proportion of oxygene, TI
have endeavoured to deterinine the relative weights of the
peculiar inflammable matter and oxygene, which compose a
given weight of boracic acid ; and to this end I made several
analytical and synthetical experiments; I shall give the results
of the two which I consider as most accurate. Twenty grains of boracic acid and thirty grains of potassium,
were made to act upon each other by heat in a tube of brass;
the result did not effervesce when washed with diluted muri-
atic acid; and there were obtained after the process, by slight
lixiviation in warm water, two grains and about -5; of the olive
coloured matter.
