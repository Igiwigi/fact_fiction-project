teeth, in different stages, may sometimes be seen.

I believe that the development of poison-fangs in two parallel series would be found
to be the rule, if indeed it be not universal, in yiperine poisonous snakes. I can only
positively answer for the English viper, the puff-adder, and the rattlesnake, these
being the only poisonous snakes of this group which TI have obtained quite fresh. But,
judging from the vacant spaces by the side of the attached poison-fangs in macerated
skulls, the arrangement holds good in all viperine snakes that I have seen.

The region where teeth are being developed in a colubrine venomous snake, the
Indian cobra, is strikingly different. There is no double series, but the successional
teeth are disposed in a single series, just like the teeth of a harmless snake, or the man-
dibular or pterygoid teeth of a poisonous snake. In fact the description which I gave
in a former paper of the manner in which the teeth of the harmless Ophidia are deve-
loped would apply strictly to the poison-fangs of a cobra, save only that the individual
tooth-germs are modified to form canaliculated teeth.

In fig. 5 there is seen a line of inflected epithelium (9g) running in from the oral
epithelium (@); this, which goes to form the enamel-organs of successive germs, is lost
sight of behind the first successional tooth-germ (2); its free extremity, already slightly
dilated near where it will form a fresh enamel-organ, is seen at f. The section, having
been taken a little behind the erect poison-fang already in use, shows no trace of this ; but
sections including the working tooth do not in the cobra show much of its s8uccessors,
which lie behind it and are recumbent, whilst it is erect. The new tooth occupies
more nearly the same spot as its predecessor than is the case in the Vipers.
