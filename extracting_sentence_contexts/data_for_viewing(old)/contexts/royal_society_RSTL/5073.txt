While projecting different sets of observations of the same vapour, the attention is
forcibly drawn to the tendency which the line shows to alter its inclination on the
most trifling change of circumstances. This inclination depends on the value of the
denominator hk, It will be remarked that this constant is nearly the same for the
vapours of ether and of water, also for a considerable number of the liquified gases.
In fact the difference is not greater than might be caused by a slight want of purity.
Even the s8pecific nature of the vessel in which the observations are made seems mate-
rially to affect the results. Dr. Farapay employed tubes of from one-fifth to one-
seventh inch bore. TI believe it will be found that the density is considerably less in
these tubes than in larger vessels ; I have had proof of this in the case of ether heated
in such tubes to 280%, The capillary attraction of the sides even at high pressures
Seems to affect the whole surface of the liquid, and to check the formation of yapour.
We must not forget also, that Dr. Farapav's temperatures are confessedly not 80
low as a correct thermometer would have indicated. The liquid he employed to
measure the temperature was alcohol, and the degrees were graduated with the same
capacity as between 32® and 212% Now from the experiments that have been made
on the expansion of alcohol by M. Gay-Lussac, and more recently by M. MuNckE,
It appears that the mean contraction between 32 and 212? is 6'2 thousandths of the
