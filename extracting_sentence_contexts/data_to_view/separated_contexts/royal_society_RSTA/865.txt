The Micius : =
satellite exchanged the cryptographic key with two ground stations, the first in Xinglong (near 18

Beijing, China) and the second one in Graz (near Vienna, Austria), allowing the realization of
such a call at the intercontinental distance of 7600 km. The Micius satellite and polarization encoding were also used to study a highly
counterintuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, that is, entanglement. In fact, the violation of
Bellâ€™s inequality is of paramount importance for fundamental physics, because it excludes
the existence of hidden-variable theories that can describe the non-local correlations between
entangled systems [29]. In 2017, Yin et al. [17] reported on the long-distance distribution of an
entangled particle to two distinct locations separated by 1203km via two satellite-to-ground
downlinks. A Bell test was performed on these particles, obtaining a Bell parameter of 2.37 + 0.09,
violating the local-hidden-variable bound under strict Einstein locality conditions.

(b) Time bin

Another possible encoding for space quantum communications is given by the temporal degree of
freedom of photons, i.e. the time-bin encoding.
