Hence even an imperfect and material picture may, in a certain
epoch of the development of the science, be found of indispensable utility. The actual theory of chemistry may be regarded as an expansion of the hypothesis of
DaLron. In science, as in other s8pheres of thought, hypotheses often pass without
question which come to us recommended by early use, and by even a $hort tradition ;

S and when embodied in symbolic language, and thus intimately blended with our con-
AQ ceptions, they are readily mistaken for facts. No statement, perhaps, would receive
S more universal or unqualified assent from chemists than that the molecule of ammonia
T contains three atoms of hydrogen, that ethylamine is derived from ammonia by the
= 8ubstitution of an atom of ethyl for an atom of hydrogen, and that the reason why
> there are three, and only three, such derivatives of ammonia is, that each derivative is
S formed by a repetition of the same process, and that, the molecule of ammonia contain-
.S ing only three atoms of hydrogen, this process can only be repeated three times. These
Â£ conclusions are regarded as 80 certain as to be almost removed from discussion.
