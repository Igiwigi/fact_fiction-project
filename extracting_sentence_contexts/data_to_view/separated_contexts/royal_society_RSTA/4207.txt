This naturalness, however, appeared or became natural only in retrospect. This arrangement was
a phenomenological construction, which amounted to that of a mathematical object, a matrix,
an element of a general non-commutative mathematical structure, part of (infinite-dimensional)
linear algebra, in effect in a Hilbert space over complex numbers, in which Heisenberg’s
matrices (‘observables’) form an operator algebra. One can also see it as a representation of an
abstract algebra, keeping in mind that Heisenberg’s infinite matrices were unbounded, which
fact is necessary to have the uncertainty relations for the corresponding continuous variables. As unbounded self-adjoint matrices, these matrices do not form an algebra with respect to
the composition as a non-commutative product, although some of them satisfy the canonical
commutation relation. Heisenberg begins his derivation by observing that ‘in quantum theory it has not been possible
to associate the electron with a point in space, considered as a function of time, by means of
observable quantities.
