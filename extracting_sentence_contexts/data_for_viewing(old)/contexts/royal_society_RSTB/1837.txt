characters are unmistakable, and it has been pointed out by SrRasBuRGER (Voc. cit.,

the form of the sporangia, and with Kauw/fussia in their circular disposition in the

sorus, while the outline of their upper free portion would point to Angiopteris: in
dehiscence it compares with all three, but especially with Marattia. In fact,
Scolecopteris elegans 7s a type which unites in itself characters of various living genera.
Other species of Srur’s genus show differences of detail, such as greater or less
length of the receptacle ; this is what is seen among living species of Marattia: or
the varying length of the terminal beak, of which Se. polymorpha (Beat.) is an extreme
case; this, though peculiar in being an extension of individual sporangia, may be
compared with the differences of upward extension of the tip of the sorus in various
types within the genus Marattia: so that this variability is not without its parallel
among modern ferns of a single genus (compare LUERSSEN, loc. cit., Plate 21). It
may be noted that the number of sporangia in the sorus of Scolecopteris, which we
thus on other grounds regard as a central type, is small and variable, but that 4 and
5 seem to be the most frequent numbers.
