f= Graphical Expression of Cubical Expansions.

I These considerations may be summarised in the following addition to the last
® italicised statement.

& In consequence of this fact the coefficients of cubical expansion of the three salts
ne with rise of temperature towards equality, which, within the limits of
A experimental error, they reach at 136°. Beyond the temperature at which identity
of expansion occurs the coefficients of expansion exhibit increasing divergence, the
order of progression being inverted, an inerease in the atomic weight of the metal
being now accompanied by an increase in the coefficient of cubical expansion,

The Linear Expansion.

The first conclusions to be drawn from an inspection of the coefficients of linear

deformation are the following :
The thermal deformation is of the nature of an expansion along all directions
