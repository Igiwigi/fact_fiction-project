Higgs field value determines their fate. Patches that lie in the safe region of the potential, shown
in green in figure 7a, will eventually end up in the EW vacuum. The fate of the patches in the other
regions depends on the details of the preheating and reheating periods after inflation. Patches in
the yellow (and even in the red) regions can still be rescued by thermal effects that tend to stabilize
the potential, provided a sufficiently large reheating temperature Try is reached fast enough.
This thermal rescue can therefore relax the bounds on the Huble rate derived in the previous
section, as shown in figure 10, for two different values of the instability scale, as measured
by Imax.

The fate of the different Hubble patches becomes even more interesting if the Higgs field
has a non-zero coupling & to gravity or couples directly to the inflaton field through c|H|?Â¢",
as discussed in the previous section as a way of relaxing the bounds on Hj. During preheating,
such couplings can in fact destabilize the Higgs potential (even in those patches that lie in the safe
region of the potential). The reason is that, when the inflaton field oscillates around its minimum,
those oscillations lead to an oscillating (or tachyonic) mass term for the Higgs field and this can
induce parametric (or tachyonic) resonant production of Higgses that build up a classical field
value that grows with Hy. Once again, if Hy is comparable or larger than the instability scale, this
triggers vacuum decay. As a result, only a range of values of the coupling & or c might be allowed.
For more details about this interesting physics, see [95-103].

6. Higgs inflation?

If it were the case that the Higgs potential is stable up to the Planck scale (although this seems less
likely with current data), one can entertain the very attractive possibility, put forward in [62-64],
that the Higgs might be responsible for cosmological inflation [104~121]. (For earlier work in this
