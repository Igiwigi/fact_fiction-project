universe accelerates for the brief period between the two, the old and the new, vacuum states.

This is very important. For each such pair of vacua, particles arriving at new vacua are able to
form ‘bubbles of new vacua’ nucleating at different spatial regions in different times. According


to Guth, this phase transition supercools the universe by 28 or more orders of magnitude below a
critical temperature, and then leads to a huge expansion of exponential growth accompanied by
a disastrous process of all sorts of irregularities in the curvatures and the matter density arising
in this phase of evolution of the universe. (This was ameliorated, however, in subsequent models
by other authors making the motion between vacua slower-leading to a unique bubble comprising
the visible universe.) In fact, a slight change in the original scenario of Guth’s showed that in the
‘new inflation’ scenario (as in various others - see below), inflation is in fact eternal [4].

But the inflationary idea, common to all inflationary models that followed Guth’s, also leads
to a much larger, homogeneous and isotropic universe, with many of the puzzling issues of the
previous models practically solved. That includes the horizon, flatness, monopole, as well as other
perplexing issues, unexplained in the standard model of cosmology. For instance, the visible
universe today—our own bubble—comprised a huge number of causally disconnected regions
at Planck time (and also at the time of inflation). But during inflation one of these regions was
inflated to encompass all others, allowing thus a restored type of causal communication between
them and leading to today’s observed uniformity.

In fact, it is a most important property of the resulting inflationary picture of the early universe,
also improved and generalized by various later modifications or extensions, that by the same
