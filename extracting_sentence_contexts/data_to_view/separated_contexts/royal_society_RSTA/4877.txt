With ferric salts, acetates give a deep
red colour, which is also produced if the solid ferric acetate is dissolved in water. It is well known that solutions of ferric chloride undergo decomposition into soluble
ferric hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, to an amount which increases as the dilution
gets greater, and as the temperature rises. The hydrochloric acid can, in fact, be
separated from the hydroxide of iron by dialysis through a membrane of parch-
ment paper. ;

The electrical conductivity of an aqueous solution of ferric acetate shows that, in this
case also, a similar reaction goes on, for it has an abnormally low conductivity, com-
pavable with that of equivalent solutions of acetic acid, just as a solution of ferric
chloride has an abnormally great conductivity owing to the presence of hydro-
chloric acid. The molecular conductivity of an aqueous solution of ferric acetate, containing
one-tenth of a gram.-equivalent of iron in one litre, was determined by measuring its
resistance in another cell, whose constant was found by filling it with standard solutions
of silver nitrate and barium chloride.
