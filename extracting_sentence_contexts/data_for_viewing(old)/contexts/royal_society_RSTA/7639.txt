and hydrogen chloride apparently react in a reproducible manner when the
reactants are brought together in the liquid state, no measurable reaction occurs
when they are brought together as gases. At first this was ascribed to the difference
in concentration between the liquid and the gaseous states. However, it was
shown (SUTHERLAND and Maass, 1931) that when propylene and hydrogen chloride
are brought together at room temperature as gases and heated above the critical
temperatures of the mixture, no reaction occurs even when they are compressed to
a concentration as great as that of the liquid mixture slightly below the critical
temperature. The rate of reaction of the liquid mixture was found to increase with
rise in temperature in the usual manner up to the critical temperature, but was
found to be nil in the absence of the liquid phase. The acquirement of results of a
similar nature by the application of the same procedure to other systems has been
delayed owing to the fact that for most systems in which a homogeneous reaction
takes place in the liquid state the critical temperatures and pressures are so high as
to enhance greatly the experimental difficulties. An attempt to overcome these
difficulties is still in progress. In the meantime other investigations have been
undertaken with the object of finding a possible explanation for a discontinuity in
reaction rate at the critical temperature. The first was an attempt to discover
whether or not at the critical temperature a marked discontinuity of state exists in
a two-component system, in contrast to the continuous change generally accepted
as taking place in a one-component system.

In the development of a technique for examining two-component systems one-
component systems were first studied. It was found that when a liquid in equili-
brium with its vapour is heated above its critical temperature, a difference in density
