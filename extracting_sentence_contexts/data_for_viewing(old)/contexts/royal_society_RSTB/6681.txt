one is inclined to doubt the existence of such a faculty. The difference in bulk between a
parasite egg and early larva, considered in relation to the entire mass of the host, is
very small; even the fourth instar of the parasite is only equal in size to the head
capsule of its host, and yet the ovipositing female shows by her behaviour a quite
definite appreciation of its significance for her offspring. In this connexion some recent
work of Maple (1937) with a related species, Ooencyrtus johnsoni Howard is of interest.
This worker found that the female parasite frequently lays two or three eggs in the host,
Murgantia histrionica Hahn., which is capable of supporting this number of parasites
to maturity. After one egg is deposited usually a second and sometimes a third is laid
immediately through the same puncture in the host chorion without the ovipositor
being sheathed. In laboratory experiments hosts containing two parasite eggs were
more common than those containing one or three. Although superparasitism with a
partial survival may occur, the facts indicate that the oviposition response is in some way
related to the quantity of host material present, and accords with the above theory.

This interpretation of the behaviour is a special application of the general principle
noted by Thompson and Parker (1927) to the effect that the number of eggs deposited
by a parasite in a host is roughly proportional to the amount of food material available.
In the present instance, however, it seems essential to introduce some conception of
the quality of the food material available, for the differences in quantity of host material
or movements of parasite stages between host types which are unparasitized, parasitized
with a parasite egg, and parasitized with an early larva, are so small that, taken singly
or together, one cannot see how they are perceptible, but considered as parts related
to a whole they function in helping the female to determine the nature of the host.
