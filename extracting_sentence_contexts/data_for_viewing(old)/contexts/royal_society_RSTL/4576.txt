Other bodies of less ductility and more of a crystalline structure, such as cast iron,
stone, glass, &c., seem to be subject to the same law. In these cases it seldom happens
that the whole of the particles are brought into action at, once, as much depends upon
the conditions of the body, the unequal state of tension of its parts, and the strain
which some of the particles must sustain before the others receive their due portion
of the load. Should the non-resisting particles be within the limits of elongation of
the other particles, the body will then have attained its maximum power of resistance ;
but in the event of rupture to any of the resisting particles, the cohesive force of the
body is thereby reduced, and that to the extent of the injury sustained by the frac-
tured parts.

«There are however,” as Dr. Ropinsox truly observes, © immense varieties in the
stracture and composition of bodies which lead to important facts, and prove that
the absolute cohesion of all bodies, whatever be their texture, is proportional to the
areas of their sections.” Undoubtedly this is the case in bodies having an uniform
texture with straight fibres, and hence it follows that the absolute strength of a body,
resisting a tensile strain, will be as the area of its section.

The peculiar nature of the material combining a crystalline as well as a fibrous
structure has led to these observations. In some instances the specimens experi-
mented upon exhibited an almost distinct fibrous texture, and in others a clearly de-
veloped crystalline structure*. At other times some of the specimens were of a mixed
kind, with the crystalline and fibrous forms united ; the fracture having a laminated
appearance, with the crystalline parts closely bound on each side by layers of the
fibrous structure. These varieties are probably produced in the manufacture, and
