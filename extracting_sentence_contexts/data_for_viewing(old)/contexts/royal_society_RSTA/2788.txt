theorem for the image of the moment map of a
e-mail: eva.miranda@upc.edu Hamiltonian torus action on a b’’-symplectic manifold.
b-Symplectic manifolds are Poisson manifolds where
the Poisson structure is invertible on the complement of
a hypersurface Z, and has a singularity of order m on Z,
where m > 1 is an integer. They are a generalization of b-
symplectic [1-3] (or log-symplectic) manifolds and were
introduced in the thesis of Scott [4].

In the case of Hamiltonian torus actions on compact
symplectic manifolds, the convexity theorem of Atiyah
[5] and Guillemin & Sternberg [6,7] is a classical
fact about integrable systems on compact manifolds.
A convexity theorem for the moment image of a
Hamiltonian torus action on a b-symplectic manifold
was proved in [8]. In this case, the moment image is
governed by the singularity of the moment map in the
