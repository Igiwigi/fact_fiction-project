most effective mixture of AMPs that fits the current infection.
We cannot test this conjecture here with the available data, not
least because expression levels are not always identical to the
level of circulating proteins (AMPs). However, the conjecture
would also predict that a given combination of AMPs affects
different parasite strains differently. This seems indeed to be
the case (cf. figure 2). Furthermore, we should expect that strains
vary in the deviation of observed effect versus the predicted
interaction effect according to Bliss Independence or Loewe


Additivity. This we also found in our study (cf. figure 5) and Funding. The authors were financially supported by an ERC Advanced | 8 |
