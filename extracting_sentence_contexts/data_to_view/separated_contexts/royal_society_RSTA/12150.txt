s The papers of these two men may probably have had a beneficial effect in instigating
SHautey to prepare, for the Royal Society, a paper presenting the results of his
“3 researches as to the observable facts of the winds, and his speculations to account for
“the prevalent directions of their motions. In 1686, about one year after Dr.
@Garpen’s paper, Hatxey, then at the age of thirty, submitted to the Society an
} elaborate and very clear account of the information as to the winds in different parts of
= the world which he could collect from numerous sourees, including observations carefully
& made by himself on voyages and on land between the Tropics. The title of his paper
& in the ‘ Transactions,’ is “ An Historical Account of the Trade Winds, and Monsoons
zy observable in the Seas between and near the Tropicks, with an attempt to assign the
2 Physical Causes of the said Winds.”+ His description of the observed facts and his
& theoretical considerations on the subject, have constituted an important step in the
iS development of the science of that subject, even though his theory in its most important
part—that which relates to the east to west motion of the Trade Winds—turns out to
be fundamentally untenable. He adduced, no doubt, in his explanation, an important
part of the real truth as to causes of the wind, a part which, if not first suggested by
him, was clearly either not generally known or not generally adopted at the time. This true element in his theory consisted in his assigning as the primary motive
cause of the winds, the expansion of the air of hot regions, accompanied by its outflow
in its upper parts from those regions towards places of less heat and entailing a
