abdominally with bold orange-and-black spots, orange tubercles, or even (Planema
aganice) long pink filaments !

“Very splendid gilding (evanescent after death) occurs in some of the Tortoise-
beetles (Cassidide). In these insects—almost circular in outline, flat abdominally,
convex superiorly, with subdiaphanous extended margin—which rest exposed on
leaves, there certainly 7s much resemblance to glittering dew-drops.”

The evidence that P. cardwi seems to prefer mineral surroundings is favourable.
The Danainz are evidently the group of pups: which make use of this appearance as
a warning, but, for the reasons given above, I think it is more probable that the
protective colouring is ancestral, and its use as a warning is secondary, rather than
that the development of the appearance took place in the reverse order. The fact
that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved the existence of colour susceptibility in the pupa of
Acrea esebria—one of a group protected by the possession of an unpleasant taste—
greatly supports the suggestion that the conspicuous warning appearance has been
secondarily acquired,

It is very probable that, the gilded appearance having been once acquired, and closely
resembling a very widespread and conspicuous mineral, the continued use of a small
proportion of the colouring might be protective when the insect no longer pupated
on mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest the common
mineral, whatever the position of the insect may be, and because of the resemblance
to the glittering of dew upon leaves, as Mr. Trimen suggests. Thus the amount of
gilding present upon the green form of V. Jo may, perhaps, have this protective value.
