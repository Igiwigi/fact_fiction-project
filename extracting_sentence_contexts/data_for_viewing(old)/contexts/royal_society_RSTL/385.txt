« Saturate the juice of apples, whether ripe or unripe, with
carbonate of potash; add solution of acetate of lead until
it cease to produce a precipitation. To the edulcorated
precipitate, add as much dilute vitriolic acid, as is necessary
to give the mixture a perfectly acid taste, without any sweet-
ness.””*

There are several objections to this process, all of which
seem to have considerable weight. In the preceding pages I
have shown, that the juice of apples, whether ripe or unripe,
always contains two acids of very different properties. By
the above process these acids are not separated; they are in
fact found in what is supposed to be the resulting pure malic
acid. and it is impossible, without the most complicated pro-
cesses, to obtain this substance in the insulated form.

The precipitation of the lead by means of sulphuric acid,
appears to be objectionable. I have often attempted to adjust
the proportion of the latter substance, so as to throw down all
the lead, without leaving any free sulphuric acid, but I uni-
formly failed : and it is evident, that, if not impossible, it is
exceedingly difficult and troublesome.

of lime, by means of sulphuric acid, but found © the mode
