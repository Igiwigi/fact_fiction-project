How to distinguish the exact individual aspects
defining human ‘culture’? On the one hand, the study of life processes at diverse
scales encompasses the broad spectrum of fields mentioned above. On the other
hand, owing to the fact that life can only, in a very rough approximation, be
studied at a single level, a deeper understanding of its entangled aspects may
require approaches contrasting with the usual reductionism of science. Moreover,
by its multi-disciplinary nature, it most probably needs to be addressed by
researchers of different fields working in close interaction. Then, life, still one
of the great challenges to science, may find proper answers from the point of view
of complexity science.
