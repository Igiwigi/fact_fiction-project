Hg 19, and, further, that in many cases A, and A, were also themselves multiples of
the same number. As, however, Mg with a difference of 450 and Zn of 543 could not
possibly be brought into line with the others, this line of attack was given up. But
later the case of Zn, which at first had seemed to stand in the way of an explanation
on these lines, gave cause for encouragement. The series for Zn are well defined, the
measures good, and the formule reproduce the lines with great accuracy.* Great
confidence can thus be put in the values for A, and A,, and it was noticed that they
were both extremely exact multiples of the difference A,—2A,. In fact, the values
are A, = 31x 543°446w? and A, = 15x 543°476w*. This relation could hardly be due
ato mere chance, especially when it was also noticed that 543°44 is very close to 3/2 the
former 360, and, further, the 450 of Mg is about 5/4 the same. In other words, with
Bike rough values used 860 = 4x90, 450 = 5x90, and 540 =6x90. This looked so
2 promising that a systematic discussion of all the data at disposal with limits of
Bpossible variation was undertaken. The theory to be tested then is that the A of
‘any element which give its doublet or triplet separations are multiples of a quantity
§ proportional to the square of the atomic weight. We will denote this by é = qu’.
Bit will be convenient, in general, to deal with the 360 quantity, and 3 will be used to
spdenote this. If other multiples are dealt with as units a subscript unit will be used
é giving the multiple of the 90. Thus 3, denotes the smallest, j, = 542°7w*, and so on.
