C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

medullary cavity alone having a diameter of 2 inches. I think this chain of facts jus-
tifies me in my conclusion that the common Calamitean medullary casts owe their form
to a vital process carried on during the life of the plant, and not to. an inorganic decay
of the pith-cells occurring after its death *,

Of the common instarices in which we find the well-defined Calamite composed of
Shale or sandstone, and covered by a carbonaceous layer, we have now no difficulty in
discovering an explanation. The medullary cavities, and in the case of the Calamopitus
the verticillate radial canals also, have been filled up with inorganic matter which formed
an exact cast of each cavity and canal. This cast, having become indurated, retained
permanently the grooves and ridges impressed upon it by the inner surface of the woody
zone; in the case of the Calamopitus there also projected more or less prominently from
the surface of the cast the inorganic contents of the verticillate infranodal canals, which
in their uncompressed condition would stand out from the central cast like spokes from
the nave of a wheel. $0 long as the woody zone retained its integrity these conditions
remained unchanged ; but pressure and chemical agencies gradually produced alterations,
As the vegetable tissues of the plant became converted into coal, their structure- dis
appeared along with much of the material composing them.
