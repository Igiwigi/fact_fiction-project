A small portion of the blastoderm then becomes
invaginated to form the primitive digestion cavity, and the remainder becomes the
ectoderm. The centrolycethal type of segmentation presents great variations in the different
groups of Arthropods, but in nearly all cases its peculiarities are 80 well marked

* The whole snbject of segmentation has been 80 ably and exhanstively reviewed by BALFOUR in his
recent work on * Comparative Embryology,” that it does not seem necessary to burden this paper with
a long lisb of references to the literature of Arthropod segmentation, or to enter into an exposition of the
present state of our knowledge of the snbject. All the exsential facts and opinions may be found on
pages 79-99, 317-379, and 425-433 of vol. i. of the * Comparative Embryology.”
