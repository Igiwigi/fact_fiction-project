He admits that it is not explained why cereals do not
benefit by these actions as well as Papilionaceze ; and he suggests whether the greater
evaporation from their leaves causes greater aération of the soil. Here, then, the gain of nitrogen by the Leguminose is explained in a very different
manner from that assumed by other recent experimenters. It seems to us, however,
that the undoubted fact that the Graminex, and other plants than the Papilionaces,
do not benefit by the actions supposed, excludes the supposition that Wourr’s results
with Papilionacex are to be so explained. It is true that neither in the growth of the
clover in ignited soil, nor in that of the sand-peas in the washed sand, were the
conditions such as would seem favourable for the presence, development, and agency
of micro-organisms. But if, in the experiments in free air, there was no accidental
source of combined nitrogen, it would seem that the influence of micro-organisms is at
least as probable as that of the actions which WoLrFr supposes.
