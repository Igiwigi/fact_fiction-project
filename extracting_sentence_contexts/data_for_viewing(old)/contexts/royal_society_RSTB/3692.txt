physiological examination is being made the presence of the horse-hair at once
discloses the seat of anastomosis, and this facilitates re-exposure of the nerve for
examination. It is always found encapsuled in the position in which it was left.

(5) Association Movements.

These, which I first described as being present in addition to the independent
movements of the face, were brought out in my case only during violent innervation
of the spinal accessory. It might have been thought that these movements were the
result of maintaining the peripheral segment of the substitute nerve in continuity
with its own central segment, but in the case which was published by Cusurne (26)
in 1903, the peripheral segment of the spinal accessory was abandoned, union being
anâ€˜end to end one, and yet, despite this fact of retaining the entire spinal accessory
for the face, the association movements were certainly quite as pronounced as in the
case published by me.

The cases of anastomosis which have been published from time to time show great

variation in these association movements. Thus some have had these alone
developed, and practically no independent movement of the face (KOrrE, BALLANcE,
Gtuck). In others they have been present in addition to the independent
movements of the face, and discovered only when looked for, and never causing the
