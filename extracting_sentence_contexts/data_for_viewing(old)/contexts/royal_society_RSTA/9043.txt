ON THE STRESSES IN A NON-UNIFORM RAREFIED MONATOMIC GAS, 31

The ratio of the coefficient of the last term in equation (12.02) to that of the corre-
sponding temperature derivative is 2 zB which is of the order 10>", and is independent

of the degree of rarefaction.* Maxwext was, therefore, justified in neglecting the time
derivatives.
