Let us suppose, to start with, that the primitive arrangement of the parts is more or
less nearly that found in Lepidosteus, where we have well-developed ribs in the region
of the trunk, girthing the body-cavity, and uniting in the candal region to form the
ventral parts of the hamal arches. It is easy to conceive that the ribs m the trunk
might somewhat alter their position by passing into the muscles, along the inter-
muscular s8epta, till they come to lie between the dorso-lateral and ventro-lateral
muscles, as in Elasmobranchii. Lepidosteus itself affords a proof that such a change

position of the ribs is nob impossible, in that it differs from other Ganoids and
om Teleostei in the fact that the free ends of the ribs leave the neighbourhood of
body-cavity and penetrate into the muscles.
| Tf it be granted that the mere difference in position between the ribs of Ganoids
and Elasmobranchii is nob of itself sufficient to disprove their homology, let us attempt
to picture what would take place at the junction of the trunk and tail in a type in
which the ribs had undergone the above change in position. On nearing the tail it
' may be supposed that the ribs would gradually become shorter, and at the same time
' alter their position, till finally they shaded off into ordinary hemal processes. If,
however, the hemal canal became prolonged forwards by the formation of some
additional complete or nearly complete hzmal arches, an alteration in the relation of
E the parts would necessarily take place. Owing to the position of the ribs, these
S8tructures could hardly assist in the new formation of the anterior part of the hamal
= canal, bub the continuation forwards of the canal would be effected by prolongations
