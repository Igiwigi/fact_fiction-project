S An inspection of these values will show that they indicate a generally attractive force

Q Point nearly centrically situated with respect to the four compasses. We may, in fact,
I think, infer that the mean of these values, or a B of —-443, and a G of +494, is due
to the general magnetism of the ship, and as regards G partly to the new iron beams,

tization. These differences—which are also multiplied by a(-860) to express them 1

terms of the earth's magnetic force as unit—will be
