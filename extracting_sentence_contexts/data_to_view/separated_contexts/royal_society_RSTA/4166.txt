Now, if X, Y, Z be the three components of electric force, we easily find

or they are the three components of a “ potential function
V = Be~ sin pat Ms bs ). ~ de ry

Take B= — EI, and we see that V is the potential* due to a “double point”
of moment oscillating between +- E/e~”' and — Ele”; thus the maximum charges
rapidly diminish with the time. In fact, we have a system entirely analogous with
that of Herrz, except for this rapid diminution of the maximum charges with the
time. It is in this running down of the maximum charges that the damping effect of
the oscillator consists. (3.)
