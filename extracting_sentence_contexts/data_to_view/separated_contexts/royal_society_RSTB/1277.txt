Even if this was so for har
solids, such as glass—and the results of our comparative experiments did not point t
it—it appeared most improbable that it could apply to a substance so permeate
and little differentiated from the water as woody cell-wall. To test the behaviou
of this material in presence of air-containing water under tension, we enclosed chips 0
the wood of Taaus baccata, which had been boiled in water to ensure complet
wetting, in tubes and subjected them to tension by cooling. In not one experime
of many did rupture occur at the chips, the liquid appeared, in fact, to break prefe
ably anywhere else. We add particulars of the experiments. .

(1.) A cylindrical glass vessel of 328 cub. centims. capacity was washed first wi
potassium hydrate and secondly with dilute hydrochloric acid, and finally boiled fo
an hour about half filled with water. A beaker of water was also boiled for about
hour, and then let cool to the air temperature, while only covered with a she
of filter paper to keep out dust.
