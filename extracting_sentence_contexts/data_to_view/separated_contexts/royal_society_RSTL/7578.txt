In a foetus 1:5 I notice a light cleft in the nasal process of
the superior maxilla corresponding with the top of the groove on its inner surface, but


EARLY GROWTH OF THE BONES OF THE HUMAN FACE. 169

I have never Â£een anything like an approach to the formation of a distinct anterior
plate of bone, snch as forms part of the premaxille of mammals. Yet, despite the peculiarity which results from the formation of the incisor process
and the shutting in of the intermaxillaries in Man, these bones closely resemble those
corresponding with them in mammalia. They have a similar wedge-shaped articular
Surface, fitting a groove in either superior maxilla; they extend towards the middle line
and articulate there; they form the anterior extremity of the palate; they bound and
divide the incisive foramina; they assist in forming no inconsiderable portion of the
sockets for the incisor teeth ; that they do not completely form them is a fact occasionally
confirmed by the imperfect character of the sockets which lodge these teeth in those cases
of cleft palate which have the intermaxillary bones isolated from the superior maxille. Another interesting point may be noticed. In some mammals having a slight upper
Jaw, a Sheep for example, the outer wall of the nostril is smooth, there is no vertical
ridge. ch as that which in Man rises to the turbinate bone.
