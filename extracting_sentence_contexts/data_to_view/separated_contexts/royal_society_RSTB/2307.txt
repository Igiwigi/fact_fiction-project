The values obtained are almost identical with those of Warrz, but depart some-
what from the value "133 deduced by Steran and O. E. Meyer from theoretical
considerations based on the coefficient of viscosity of the two gases, carbon dioxide
and air (see O. E. Mryer’s ‘ Kinetic Theory,’ p. 275, Engl. ed., 1899), and also from
the commonly received value of ‘142 obtained by Loscumipr for much higher ratios of
mixture,

According to the kinetic theory of diffusion of Sreran and Maxwett, diffusivity
should be as constant a property as conductivity of heat in a solid, but O. E. Mryer’s
expansion of this theory leads to a somewhat different conclusion, which may be
expressed as follows :—If the total number of molecules in unit volume of a mixture
of two diffusing gases is represented by N, and the changing number of molecules
of the constituents by N,, N, respectively, then the diffusivity will be found to vary
slightly with the ratio of mixture N,/N,, whereas according to SreraAn and Max-
WELL's views the coefficient of diffusion is independent of this ratio. In the ease of CO, and air Meyer's theory leads to a lower coetticient of diffusion
than ‘142 for the extremely dilute CO, with which we have to deal in ordinary air,
whereas we find a distinctly higher value than this, one in fact which is quite as high
as some of those obtained by the ordinary methods of mixture originally employed
by Loscumipr,

(2) Diffusion of Aqueous Vapour in Air. An attempt was made to determine the value of & for aqueous vapour at low
tensions when diffusing into air, in the following manner :—

Small dishes or cylinders, from 4 to 6 centims. in diameter, were covered with thin
mica dises which were fixed on to them with Canada balsam.
