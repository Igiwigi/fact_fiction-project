2814. The mutual action of two portions of paramagnetic matter, when they are
both in such a field of equal magnetic force, may be anticipated from the principles
(2807. 2830.), or from the corresponding facts, which are generally known, Two
spheres of iron, if retained in the same equatorial plane, repel each other strongly ;
but as they are allowed to depart out of that plane, they first lose their mutual re-
pulsive force and then attract each other, and that they do most powerfully when in
an axial direction.

2815, With diamagnetic bodies the mutual action is more difficult to determine,
because of the comparative lowness of their condition. I therefore resorted to the
expedient, before described, of using a saturated solution of protosulpbate of iron as
the medium occupying the field of equal magnetic force, and employing two cylinders
of phosphorus, about an inch long and half an inch in diameter, as the diamagnetic
bodies. One of these was suspended at the end of a lever, which was itself suspended
by cocoon-silk, s0 as to have extremely free motion, and the adjustments were such,
that when the phosphorus cylinder was in the middle of the magnetic field, it was free
