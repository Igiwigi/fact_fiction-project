over the Indian seas during the months, June, July, August and September, as given
in Dauias’s * Meteorological Atlas of the Indian Seas,’ gives the following results :—

From this it will be seen that in these months the ratio of the surface velocity to gradient
velocity is 1:2 and not 2:3. This may be partly due to the fact that the average
direction of normal monsoon isobars has been taken to be along great circles, which is
only approximately true, and partly to the fact that, in these months, the sea becomes
rough and consequently the frictional force is greater than that of a surface over which
the ratio 2:3 is applicable. For individual days also, then, we shall assume the ratio
to be 1:2and not 2:3. Inthe following table (No. IIT) the calculated and the observed
periods of microseisms have been given for some dates selected at random. The
observed surface wind velocity has been obtained from the gradient velocity on the
different dates in the manner explained above from the 8 hours’ weather charts.

The observed periods no doubt show a general increase with increase in wind velocity,
but they are smaller than the calculated periods, particularly for high winds. We have,
however, to note that an oscillatory system like the sea, which has established itself
