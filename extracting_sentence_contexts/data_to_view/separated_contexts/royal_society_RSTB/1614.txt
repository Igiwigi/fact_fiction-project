arch of v4 1

(v.', v2, 0.8 = the first, second, and third vertebrie,) The identification of the interealarium as the neural arch of the second vertebra
rests mainly on its condition and relations in certain Cyprinidw, In Cyprinus the
ossicle consists of an articular process which rests on the body of the second vertebra,
of an ascending process which forms part of the wall of the neural canal, and Â«
horizontal process terminating distally in the interossicular ligament. In the light
of such facts the nature of the intercalarium presents no special difficulty. With the
Siluridie, however, it is otherwise, In all previously investigated species the inter-
calarium is represented by a yariously shaped nodule of bone imbedded in tho inter-
ossicular ligament, and bus no connection with the walls of the neural canal, or with
