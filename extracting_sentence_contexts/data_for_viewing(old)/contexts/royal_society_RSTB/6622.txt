well defined, and the radiating cells are very numerous and minute; they are elongated
fusiform, with the canaliculi (when observable) sufficiently abundant, and arranged
for the most part at right angles to the long axis of the cells... .In the superficial and
denser portions of the tissue, the cells and tubules are the most minute; in the deeper
portions they are larger and less regular in form and the bone becomes riddled with
medullary cavities, until at length it is entirely reduced to a sort of cellular structure.”
It is evident that this account, founded on very well-preserved material, is comparable
with Reis’s description and fig. (1896, pl. VII, fig. 1) of the jaw of Acanthodes, which
is derived from much less well-preserved material.

Taken together these descriptions leave no real doubt that true bone does occur in
the visceral ossifications of Acanthodians. But if no bone cells could be observed or
even if they had never existed, it is evident from the fact that some portions of them must
be resorbed during the growth of the animal that the jaw bones of A. bronnii agree with
true bone and differ from all other vertebrate hard parts.

SUMMARY OF THE STRUCTURE OF ACANTHODIANS IN GENERAL

The Acanthodians are fish-like gnathostomes whose general build is fusiform, with
a body which may be rather deep (Cheiracanthus) but which is generally slender,
ultimately becoming eel-like (Acanthodes).

General Shape

Fins—There are one or two dorsal, an anal and a caudal fin. The tail is always
