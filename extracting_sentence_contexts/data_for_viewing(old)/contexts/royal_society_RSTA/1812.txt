To begin with, any possible source of stellar energy production is constrained by two factors.
Firstly, isotope abundances calculated from transition rates between isotopes in any putative
process of energy production are constrained by the isotope abundances we observe in space,
which themselves vary across ‘old’ and ‘new’ regions of the universe, and between stars and
interstellar space. Secondly, the rate of reaction for any putative process of energy production
is constrained by the inferred core temperatures and lifetimes of stars of different masses. We
can get a better grasp on how these constraints restrict model possibilities by considering the
role that they played in the development of the first light-element nuclear transitions proposed
as the energy source of stars [53,54]. These proposals transgressed against the constraints by
either suggesting isotope abundances mismatched to observation—in particular, interstellar
abundances of lithium, beryllium and helium isotopes—or by containing reactions that are, based
on known cross-sections, too rapid or too slow to match inferred stellar lifetimes. In fact, any
reaction that involves the capture of protons by light elements will be too fast, and any reaction
that involves the capture of protons by heavy elements will be too slow.


The two key reactions we now take to comprise stellar nucleosynthesis in main sequence stars,
the pp chain [55] and the CNO cycle [56,57], are much more promising candidates for stellar
energy production precisely because they have the right sort of reaction rates to match inferred
stellar lifetimes and produce no extra isotopes as by-products, other than the hydrogen-to-helium
transition, to match observed isotope abundances. Moreover, terrestrial measurements of nuclear
reaction cross-sections indicate that the CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, much more so
than the pp chain, and for peak efficiency requires temperatures higher than the core of stars such
as our Sun. Thus, for such stars, the pp chain is the main contributor to energy production, and
