lesion. The upper part of the right occipital lobe is slightly yellowish, as if from
commencing softening.

The brain is represented in Plate 49, fig. 4a, from the side, and in fig. 4b from below.

Remarks.—The lesion not being bilateral, experiments upon hearing, smell, and
taste could not be satisfactorily carried out. The hemiopia was probably due toa
large portion of the occipital lobe having accidentally become involved, at least
in its vascular supply; the facial paralysis to obliteration of vessels proceeding to the
“facial area” from the Sylvian fissure. The affection of general and tactile sensibility
may be due to the fact that the hippocampal region was involved in the removal.

This case furnishes an illustration of the fact that hernia cerebri is apt to accompany
the establishment of a septic condition in the exposed brain.

First Operation.—The left angular gyrus was destroyed by actual cautery. 3

The result of this operation was absolutely nil, so far as we were able to determine.
Even an hour or two after the establishment of the lesion and recovery from the
effects of the anesthetic, no impairment of vision could be detected. On bandaging
the left eye the animal still saw perfectly well with the other one, took food from the
hand, avoided obstacles, and generally displayed every token of the possession of clear
