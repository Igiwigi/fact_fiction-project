On the evidence now available, the Onychophora appear to show the lowest grade of arthropodan
head evolution, three cephalic segments being present, only one of which has become pre-oral
(pp. 555, 556). The foundations of the theory of head segmentation in Annelida and Arthropoda put forward by
Henry, Ferris and Hanke are criticized (p. 561). The theories concerning primary and secondary metamerism are reviewed and a somewhat
different interpretation of the facts is suggested. It is pointed out that primary and secondary
metamerism must tend to appear in association with the possession of early-swimming larvae in
which a premium is put on the early functioning of some parts of the body. The phenomenon is not
considered to be primitive, as has been claimed.
