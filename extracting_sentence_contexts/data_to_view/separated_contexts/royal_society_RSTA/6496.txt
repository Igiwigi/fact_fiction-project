It has been pointed out j
the introductory paragraph, however, that the result of such a distribution of
pressure would be to cause easterly instead of westerly winds, in accordance with the
usual deflecting influence of the earth’s rotation. In his last paper (‘ Proceedings
the Royal Society,’ vol. 37, 1884) this idea that the north-west winds are a direct.
effect of Himalayan cold has been dropped, as will be seen from the following
quotation, aud he anticipates the explanation on the hypothesis of convective inter-
change, which I now attempt to give. At page 18 he says: “The question then
presents itself, ‘What is the origin of the dry westerly current?’ The supposition
that the indraught from the south-west furnishes more than a small portion of the
stream is at once negatived by the fact that, even at Karachi and Bhuj, southerly winds
do not preponderate over northerly until May, and even then almost inappreciably—at
Rajkot not before June ; and the very fact of the great dryness of the west and north-
west winds militates against the idea that any considerable portion of their air-mass
can be drawn from the sea. Neither is it derived to any considerable extent from the
valleys and lower slopes of the surrounding hills. There is no permanent drainage of
air from these hill-slopes, and strong winds blowing outwards from the larger valleys,
like the dadu of Hurdwar, are local and exceptional phenomena, restricted to certain
hours of the day.
