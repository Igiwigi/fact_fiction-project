The standard view of coronal heating is that free magnetic energy is either built up in
the corona or transported to the corona, due to shuffling of the magnetic field lines in the
photosphere (e.g. [5]). The majority of coronal heating models proposed so far invoke either
dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves or magnetic reconnection. The relative
importance of these two processes should be determined by the time scale of the photospheric
driver with respect to the Alfvén time in the corona. However, it is now clear that the picture
is more complex than this simple classification would suggest. The recent understanding is : =
summarized in review articles (e.g. [3,4]), with loop heating also reviewed by, for example, 3

Although there is still no consensus on which mechanism is responsible for heating the solar nee)
atmosphere, a few simple but relevant ‘facts’ are now supported by a strong body of observational :
evidence (see also the reviews by Klimchuk [7] and Schmelz & Winebarger [8]): ne]

— there is reconnection in the corona and magnetic reconnection can dissipate stored [sz
magnetic energy; x
— there are many wave modes in the corona (but their actual contribution to coronal heating .
is still unclear);
— the solar corona cannot be treated in isolation but should be seen as part of the complex,
coupled solar atmosphere (including the chromosphere); and
— coronal heating is intrinsically non-steady.

The complexity of the solar atmosphere and the wide range of both spatial and temporal
scales on which physical processes are observed to occur mean that beyond the above list of
