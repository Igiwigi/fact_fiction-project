Under these conditions,
they aver, the investment required to obtain fish may actually
have been maladaptive. An alternative economic explanation
for the Tasmaniansâ€™ decision to fish less often has been outlined
by Hiscock [32]. The implication of these arguments is that, even
if it were the case that the Tasmanians did not ever eat fish, we
could not infer anything about the impact of population size
on cultural complexity from that fact. The other issue is that it
is not uncommon for stable or expanding populations to avoid
fish despite having ready access to them. For instance, stable

isotope evidence indicates that the first farmers in Britain did
not consume marine resources even when they lived close to
the sea [33].
