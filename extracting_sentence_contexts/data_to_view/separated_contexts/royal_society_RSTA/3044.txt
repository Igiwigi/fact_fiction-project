At this stage, the thermal noise contribution from
the wires for the 4km long arms of the LIGO detectors was still below the photon shot noise
[13] limits, and a strain sensitivity of 1 x 10-19/ ./Hz at 100 Hz could be achieved. It was clear,
however, that for any improvements in sensitivity to LIGO and Virgo to be achieved, alternative
solutions to wire suspensions were needed. In fact for GEO600, with its shorter 600m arm
length, it was determined that thermal noise from metal wires would limit the sensitivity of the
detector. Therefore, steps were taken to find alternative wire materials [24], before finally settling
on fused silica, which had more than a factor 100 lower mechanical loss than any metal wires
tested [25,26]. The thermal noise contribution from the suspension wires/fibres could in that way
be pushed below 1 x 10-19 / /Hz at 50 Hz [26-29].
