any apparent injury to its ultimate
powers of resistance. Tt broke, however, with 313,000 additional changes when loaded
to one third the breaking-weight, evidently showing that the construction is not safe when
tested with alternate changes of a load equivalent to one third the weight that would
break it.” In the case of ships, however, Mr. FARBAIRN thinks the strain brought upon
the material should not exceed one fourth or one fifth its ultimate strength, on account of
the fact that the changes of strain are not merely effective as regards its amount, but
also as regards its direction. His final conclusion is that in iron ships * it seems highly
probable that a strain of 5 tons per square inch on the material acting alternately in
opposite directions would at least injure, if it did not ultimately fracture, the material
after a great number of alterations.” Professor RANKINE, I may add, also considers that;
the strain on the material in iron ships should not exceed one fifth of the ultimate
strength, and thus provides for the changes of strain of which I have been speaking.
