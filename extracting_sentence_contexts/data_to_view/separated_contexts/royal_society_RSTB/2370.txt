14, the whole “seed”
is narrower than elsewhere, and the sporangium smaller, compared with the sporophyll
and integument. The micropyle extends to this extremity, but the attachment
between sporangium and sporophyll is missed. The facts already detailed show that the integument of Lepidocarpon Lomaxi was
a wall of tissue which grew up on either side of the sporangium from the upper part

of the sporophyll-pedicel. Along the greater part of the length of the pedicel the

extremity this was not the case, the margin of the sporophyll projecting far beyond
the base of the integument.
