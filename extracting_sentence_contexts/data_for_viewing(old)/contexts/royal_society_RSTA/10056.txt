occupy each one side of a big old valley in St. Vincent. The ridge itself is perhaps
50 feet higher than the valley on each side, and broad in proportion. It consists of
fragmentary ejecta of the 1902 eruption, including a good many large blocks, The
temperature of the fumaroles had been as high as 300° C. last year, but was
gradually decreasing. M. Gurnorseau found it to be about 230° C. at the time of
our visit. This group is the only one about the nature of which any doubt now
exists, but it appears most probable that its origin, like that of the others, is
superficial.

The differences between the two valleys are not by any means so great as the
resemblances, and they appear to be all traceable to two causes, viz., the repeated, or
rather, the at one time almost constant, passage of the incandescent avalanches, and
the fact that owing to the configuration of the crater these all descend through the
V-shaped gap right down the valley on which they spend their whole force. Thus
the denudation of the deposits is in a somewhat less advanced stage than in the
Wallibu, and the bedding somewhat more complicated owing to an alternation of
water-sorted beds with those of fresh ash. Moreover, apparently owing to the very
direct course of the valley from the V gap to the sea, and its steep inclination, the
number of large ejected blocks even in the lower part of the valley is much greater
than in the corresponding part of the Wallibu. This is only what might have been
expected when I recall the stones which we saw descending by leaps and bounds in
the incandescent avalanche of July, 1902. They were large enough to be visible at
a distance of several miles and distinctly a brighter red than the rest of the avalanche
material,
