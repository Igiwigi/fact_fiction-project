us suppose that the change in the 8urface tension as the film becomes thinner is
represented by the annexed curve (fig. 1).

When the film became a little thinner than the degree of tenuity represented by P
a state of unstable equilibrium . would be reached. The thicker parts of the film
would tear the thinner parts asunder, bub rupture would be prevented by the fact
that when the point of minimum surface tension was passed the resistance would
increase until, when the thickness corresponding to Q was attained, the tensions of the
thin and thick parts of the film would be the same and equilibrium would again be
possible. The equilibrium would be stable, because if the film became thinner its
8urface tension would increase, and it would tend to contract and thus to thicken.

Such a theory would explain the approximately constant thickness of the black, on
the ground that it would be impossible for it to exist except at a thickness 8nch that
its surface tension was nearly equal to that of the liquid in mass. When the film is
very thin its tension would probably alter rapidly with the thickness, and thus the
latter would be confined within narrow limits.
