The Chlorophyceae proved very inadequate food
material, and observations on larvae fed on Chlorella stigmatophora only, seemed to indicate
that they were unable to digest them. Very little growth occurred in such larvae, but those
fed on Nitzchia closterium grew well and so did those fed on Dicrateria inornata and a mixture
of diatoms.

Some larvae were cultured in Erdschreiber solution, and grew larger than those cultured
in sea water, but their increased growth was probably due to the Erdschreiber solution
maintaining a multiplying stock of food materials between periodic inoculations, and so
a more constant supply of food for the larvae, rather than to the fact that the larvae derived
any direct benefit from the Erdschreiber itself.

12. Discussion

Hitherto the accounts of the early cleavage stages of the Enteropneusta have been few
and somewhat contradictory. Bateson (1884) assumed that in Saccoglossus kowalevskyi
cleavage was regular, but Davis (1908) obtained a single series of cleavage stages of
S. pusillus and observed that the first two cleavages were total and equal, but that the sub-
sequent ones were irregular.
