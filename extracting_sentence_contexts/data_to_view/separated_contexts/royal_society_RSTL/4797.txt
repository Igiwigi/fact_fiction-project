Purified by a simple rectifica-
Aion, this compound presents itself as a colourless limpid liquid of a specific gravity of
9-05 at 15%5 C., and boiling constantly between 206? and 207? C. (Bar. 0=:754),
So88essing an aromatic odour recalling that of oxalic ether, with a faint admixture of
She 8mell of mustard oil. A similar remark in fact applies to all the allyl-compounds ;
-Shey smell like the corresponding ethyl-compounds, only somewhat more pungent. AVhen mixed with water, oxalate of allyl undergoes gradual decomposition, but it is much
ore rapidly decomposed when boiled with a solution of caustic potassa. Solution
wIf ammonia attacks it rapidly, and transforms it into oxamide and allylic alcohol.
