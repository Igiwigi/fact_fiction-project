This is

a part of that curious provision for collecting offensive par-

ticles towards the inner corner of the eye. If the edges of

the eye-lids be marked with black spots, it will be seen that

when the eye-lids are opened and closed, the spot on the

upper eye-lid will descend and rise perpendicularly, while

the spot on the lower eye-lid will play horizontally like a

shuttle. To comprehend certain actions of the muscles of the eye,
we must remember that the caruncle and membrane called
semilunaris, seated in the inner corner of the eye, are for
ridding the eye of extraneous matter, and are in fact, for
the same purpose with that apparatus which is more perfect
and appropriate in beasts and birds. The course of our enquiry makes some observation of
these parts necessary. In quadrupeds there is a gland for secreting a glutinous
and adhesive fluid, which is seated on that side of the orbit
next the nose ; it is quite distinct from the lacrymal gland ;
it is 8queezed by an apparatus of muscles, and the fluid
exudes upon the surface of the third eye-lid.
