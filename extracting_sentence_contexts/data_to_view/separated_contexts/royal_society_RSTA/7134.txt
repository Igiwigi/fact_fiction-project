In calling these flows ‘distinct’ we
speak in the analytical sense; but where the xy-regions containing two of them abut, they
join with continuity in q, @ but discontinuity in the higher derivatives. ‘Together they form
the type of solution commonly assumed for supersonic problems, and this is here obtained
as the limit of a solution which is everywhere analytic. The mechanism of this degeneracy is, in general and rather vague terms, as follows. For
a Prandtl-Meyer flow, @ is functionally related to q; in fact the hodograph point (q,@) is
confined to a single characteristic. Now the critical locus D — 0 corresponds to a pair of
characteristics, and the hodograph surface of figure 2 has, for « ~ 0, a narrow band which is
practically a cylinder standing on this critical locus. As «~~ 0 the breadth of this band tends
to zero, and if, for some hodograph solution, its map on the flow-plane remains two-dimen-
sional in the limit, a pair of Prandtl-Meyer flows will be obtained.
