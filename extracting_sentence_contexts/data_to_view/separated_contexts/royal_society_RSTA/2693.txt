If we use his allocation of 8, (4) and attempt to find constants for 8m-* we
get a formula quite out of line with the others. The first impression is to infer that
SaunpDERSâ€™ allocation of the two last lines is quite wrong, but a closer acquaintance
with other series gives more caution and suggests another way of meeting the
difficulty. As a fact, it is difficult to represent all the P series, and especially the
D series by any modification of the simple formule hitherto used. In the case of AID
it seems impossible to do so at all. Further, it will be shown in Part IIT.
