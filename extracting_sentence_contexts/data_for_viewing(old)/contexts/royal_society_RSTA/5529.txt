interested in the one with largest real part.

For homogeneous Neumann or periodic boundary conditions, a Turing instability corresponds
to the situation where (49) < 0 and (Ax) > 0 for some k > 0. In this case, the two growth rates
denoted by Ag correspond exactly to the eigenvalues of J, and so the first requirement says that
J is a stable (Hurwitz) matrix. More generally, analysis of the zeroes of the transport operator is
needed to determine how to think about stability in the absence of diffusion [21], but typically we
require J to be a stable matrix. We consider the value of Ax as a function of the spatial eigenvalue
pk, and refer to this as the dispersion relation.

From this analysis, it can be shown that for two-species systems, the largest growth rate Ax will
be real at the parameter space boundary of a Turing bifurcation (so that such a bifurcation does
not indicate an oscillatory instability). Several other facts can readily be established about these
instabilities, such as requiring D, 4 Dy, fy and g, to be of opposite signs, with the positive sign
corresponding to a slower-diffusing activator, and the negative a fast-diffusing inhibitor. This
is a classical example of local-activation long-range-inhibition, which has been implicated in a
range of biological pattern formation scenarios [22]. The Turing space can be defined from this
analysis as the set of parameters which admit this kind of instability. For large domains (i.e. in the
approximation of a continuous spectrum p;), one can show that such a space is defined by a set
of four inequalities. We refer to ([4], Ch. 2) for a systematic treatment of these classical results.

We remark that the standard ansatz in the stability analysis above is based on the existence
of a complete orthonormal basis of the Laplace operator (including the boundary conditions) in
