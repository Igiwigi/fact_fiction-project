The section of this
digit in the middle gives a somewhat roundish outline ; its general shape is oval, the

proximal third is a little curved forwards to fit more exactly the outline of the neigh-
bouring fourth metatarsal. The Metatarsals of Diplopus.

of these I found several specimens in a perfect state of preservation in the
collection of the Britich Musenm F. They are all said to come from Hordwell ;

* In Hyopotamus, although the third cuneiform has no regular truncated edge, as in Z[ippopotamus (Plate
XXXVII. fig. 10, c,) and Anthracotherium, for the articulation of the second metatarsal, still this metacarpal,
owing to the fact that the second euneiform is situated a little higher than the third, is allowed to touch this
last, remaining thus true to typical relations.

+ On my second visit, to Puy, after this paper was written, T 8aw, in the collection of Mr. Visar, a detached
sccond metatarsal of unusually largo size. It belonged to the large species, and, judging by this bone, all the
four metatarsals of the larger species of Hyopotami were nearly subequal, as in the recent Hippopotamus,

Diplopus from Hempstead, and, vice versd, not a single specimen of the tetradactyle
Hyopotamus from Hordwell.
