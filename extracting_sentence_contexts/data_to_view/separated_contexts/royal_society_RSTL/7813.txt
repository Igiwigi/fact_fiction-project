The hypothesis mentioned aboye is not borne out by the numbers in the preceding
Table. : I

The nature of the soil on which the trees were grown is throughout the whole very
similar. As the great disturbance which might be supposed to occur from variations in
the compoxsition of the soil does not take place to any considerable extent under the con-
ditions of the experiment, it is difficult to perceive any canse that can obscure the con-
sequences of the hypothesis, supposing it to be'true, | But in order to test it still further,
the bases in the ash were sgparately determined in a few cases in which the divergence
was most marked, and the numbers obtained were compared with the amount of alka-

loid, but without at all diminishing the discrepancy, I am therefore compelled to believe
either that the hypothesis is not true, or else that it is only true to a yery partial extent ;
in fact 0 partially as to render it of no assistance in the scientific culture of cin-
chona. In order to test the hypothesis in another manner, the s0il round some young trees of
C. $uccirubra, which was naturally singularly poor in lime, was made, by constant dres-
sing with well-exposed hydrate of lime, almost into a calcareous s0il. After two years
and a half the bark was analyzed and its ash determined.
