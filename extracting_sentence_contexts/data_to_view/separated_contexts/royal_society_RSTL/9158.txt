We know also that even the most refractory metals
can be made to flow under the action of sufficiently great forces. Although Sir W. Tronsox's investigation has gone far to overthrow the old idea of
a semi-fluid interior to the earth, yet geologists are 80 strongly impressed by the fact
that enormous masses of rock are being, and have been, poured out of volcanic vents in
the earth's surface, that the belief is not yet extinct that we live on a thin shell over
a sea of molten lava. Under these circumstances it appears to be of interest to inves-
tigate the consequences which would arise from the supposition that the matter
constituting the earth is of a viscous or imperfectly elastic nature ; for if the interior
is constibuted in this way, then the solid crust, unless very thick, cannot possess
rigidity enough to repress the tidal surgings, and these hypotheses nust give results
fairly conformable to the reality. The hypothesis of imperfect elasticity will be prin-
