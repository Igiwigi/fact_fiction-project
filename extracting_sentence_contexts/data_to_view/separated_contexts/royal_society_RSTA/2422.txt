These difficulties were removed by the theorem of my former paper, according to
& which J is an invariable constant $ for all monatomic molecules. This is now seen to
% be incorrect as a general theorem, but the deviations found for the various particular
§ molecular models discussed leaves little room for doubt that fis very nearly equal to
8 in the case of all likely models. The fact simply is, therefore, that f is very
© unsuitable as a means of discrimination between different models, and ScHWARZE’s
observations indicate some mathematical fallacy in Meyer’s theory, without supporting
any particular molecular model. The observed values of f are hardly known with
sufficient accuracy to enable any conclusion to be drawn from a slight divergence
from the value §, within the limits prescribed in (249) to (251). They are important,
however, as confirming the general validity of the kinetic theory, apart from any .
hypothesis as to the nature of the molecules.
