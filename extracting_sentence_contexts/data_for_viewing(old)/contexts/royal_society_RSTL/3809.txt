the current was evidently due to the atmospheric air in solution combining with the
carbonie oxide; this I proved by some of the test experiments before mentioned,
which I need not recapitulate.

LZxperiment 23, â€”Hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphate of ammonia. This combina-
tion also gave effects with which the nitrogen appeared to have nothing to do, this
gas being perfectly unaffected ; I tried other experiments on this point, but they all
led to the same conclusion, viz. that my idea of realizing a voltaic action by conver-
sion of the ordinary effects of electrolysis was erroneous. It may be that the above
gaseous products of electrolysis are secondary, and that water is the only electrolyte in
these cases ; but for this, as for many other theoretical questions, there are 80 many
arguments pro and con, that it is not worth while to dilate on them unless they can be
shown to lead, or to be likely to lead, to some new valuable facts or natural relations.

Reviewing the above experiments, it appears that chlorine and oxygen, on the one
hand, and hydrogen and carbonic oxide, on the other, are the only gases which were
decidedly capable of electro-synthetically combining $0 as to produce a voltaic cur-
rent#, I should perhaps except olefiant gas, which appears to give rise to a conti-
