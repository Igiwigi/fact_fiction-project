currently thought of as complex adaptive systems [115]; this
point of view will certainly initiate interesting conversations
and speculations on whether the behaviour of communicating
viruses qualify as an example of brain-like functions.

Perhaps a brain is best described not as an actual physical
object, but as an emergent process whose individual struc-
tural components are subject to biological evolution and
may possess physical independence in order to collectively
generate aspects of behaviour. In other words, the brain can
be seen as a rather fluid or liquid entity. There is little
doubt that much more work is necessary to begin to under-
stand and apply these new concepts. An exciting fact about
this effort is that it is bound to generate stimulating new

tions; perhaps even ideas that our own brains have never
pondered before.

(e) Type 4: Brains within brains—superorganisms

This includes multicellular organisms displaying true eusoci-
ality. This classification includes organisms possessing
‘traditional’ nervous systems generating higher functions
upon their interaction, thus, ‘brains within brains’. Eusocial
organisms traditionally include the social insects (i.e. bees,
