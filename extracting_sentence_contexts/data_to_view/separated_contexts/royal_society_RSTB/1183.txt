Anatomically therefore there is evidence of some structural change in the path
véhere the pyramidal fibre comes into relation with the spinal centres. “The distribution of the pyramidal fibres in the spinal cord is still so much a matter
ed judice, especially after recent work by the histological* methods, that the complete
déstination of the fibres, when yet at the upper part of the cord, is unknown. =The existence of efferent fibres (internuncial) connecting each nerve centre with the

h efferent internuncial fibres must be few in number and but feebly differentiated. ‘2The efferent channels from the spinal nerve centres are the fibres composing the
daiterior roots.
