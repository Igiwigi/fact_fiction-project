(c) Single-photon avalanche diode implementation in a planar process

A conventional pn junction is implemented in a planar process through implantation and
annealing. When applying a high voltage in reverse bias, the electric field at the junction is
maximized at the corners of the junction (figure 8). This has the effect of a preferential avalanching
probability in these locations, thus causing premature edge breakdown (PEB). As a result,
a SPAD becomes sensitive only in a small section of its surface. Figure 8 shows two SPAD
implementations, where the guard ring was ineffective (figure 8a,c) and effective (figure 8b,d)
to prevent PEB.

A technique called light emission test (LET) enables one to visualize the location of avalanches
occurring in a period of time. The technique uses the fact that impact ionization generates
photons, with a certain probability, and thus avalanche discharges can be optically identified.
Figure 8 shows an LET on two different devices in which PEB suppression was, respectively,
unsuccessful and successful. Several techniques exist to implement PEB prevention. The common

Figure 8. Cross section of planar pn junction with electric field simulation (a,b), where the electric field (arb. units) is plotted
near the guard ring. In (a), the field exceeds critical values at the edge resulting in PEB, whereas, in (b), it does not [27]. The
arb. units scale goes from blue (low field) to red (high field). Light emission test: PEB-prone SPAD (c); PEB-free SPAD (d). The
