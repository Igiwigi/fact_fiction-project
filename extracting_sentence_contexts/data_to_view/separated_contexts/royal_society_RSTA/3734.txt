Yet, the unintentional drying of the same
clay automatically results in cracks at its surface that arrange themselves in an organized tile-like
pattern. The apparent ease with which such patterns occur suggests that they are encoded in the
blueprint of nature and thus spontaneously emerge. In fact, similar patterns are found to cover
mud and salt lakes the world over, on kilometric scales. In this review article, we have used a series of classic fluidic problems as a vehicle to
discuss pattern formation and its close relationship with instabilities. Specifically, in the interfacial
problems described in this review, we have found that instabilities can be the origin of the
patternâ€™s wavelength.
