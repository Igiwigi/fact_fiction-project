At the end of this time the blood-receptacle and the first bulb contain a dry red mass ;
the s8econd bulb contains a little fluid blood which has spirted over, whilst the U-tube
contains the greater part of the water of the blood which has condensed there. Some
of this is also deposited in the large bulb situated between the U-tube and the Sprengel
aspirator. After describing separately my experiments, I shall draw attention to some interesting
facts connected with the use of the Sprengel tube as a blood-pump, and show that the
8uccess of my experiments throws doubt upon statements which have lately been made
in reference to the conditions which are most favourable for the extraction of gases
from the blood. In order that the observations which have been made upon the gases of blood treated
with nitrites should be understood, and to prove the accuracy and value of the methods
used, I must quote ome analyses of blood to which no nitrite was added. I.
