Gildor & Tziperman [59] take a moderate step towards higher model
complexity by considering a slightly more explicit representation of atmosphere,
ocean, sea ice and land ice dynamics. Namely, the ocean is divided into eight
boxes, and the atmosphere into four boxes. The sea ice fraction responds to
standard energy balance equations. More crucially, land ice growth is influenced
by a somewhat controversial feedback between sea ice and precipitation. The
feedback is controversial because it is assumed that cold climate results in a
reduction in ice volume: sea ice growth causes a reduction in precipitation in ice-
covered areas and, by this mechanism, almost suppresses accumulation of snow on
ice sheets. The latter then no longer compensates for ice ablation and ice volume
shrinks.

A free oscillation arises from the fact that the ice volume thresholds for
switching sea ice cover ‘on’ and ‘off’ differ. In other words, sea ice displays a
hysteresis response to variations in ice volume. This is exactly the principle of
the slow-fast relaxation oscillator depicted in figure 2a: the curve of equilibrium of
sea ice with respect to ice volume is the slow manifold, and ice volume integrates
the state of sea ice in time. In turn, this oscillation can be synchronized on the
astronomical forcing.

The Gildor-Tziperman model is coupled to a biogeochemical cycle in a
companion paper [60], but the essential dynamics of the glacial oscillation are
unchanged. Tziperman et al. [61] further comment on the model and its property
of synchronization on the astronomical forcing, and find that its behaviour is
essentially reducible to a hybrid dynamical system.
