symptom of impregnation occurs s0mewhat s0oner than the formation of the chamber,
or within the first half-hour, and consists in a marked increase in the degree of undu-
latory heaving and sinking of portions of the surface of the yelk, motions which take
place slightly in the unimpregnated egg, but are increased in the impregnated ;
although, even in that, they are not sufficiently permanent to be easily recognized as
proofs of fecundation. The irregular contraction and $hrivelled appearance of the
yelks, noticed in the preceding observations, may, perhaps, be due in part to this
cause, The formation of the chamber is the result of the contraction and depression
of the upper surface of the yelk, occasioned, as there is reason to think, by changes
which are going on within the substance of the upper hemisphere of the yelk, around
the embryo vesicle, or its progeny, and which changes appear to be due to the opera-
tion of the spermatozoon; as I have never observed the chamber in any egg which
has not been more or less fecundated. The fact of the existence of a chamber, therefore,
may always be regarded as a proof of fecundation. It is commenced sooner or later
according to the temperature of the surrounding medium, and to the more or less
complete fecundation of the egg. It is usually perceptible in about one howr, or one
hour and a quarter after the impregnating fluid has been supplied to the egg, and is
distinctly marked in less than one hour and a half, when the eggs are preserved in a
temperature of from 50? to 55* Faur., and its size is increased during the first three
hours. It is commenced in a slight depression in the centre of the upper surface of
the yelk, at a point which corresponds to the entrance to the central canal, and it
takes place much sooner in eggs which have been completely fecundated, even at
moderate temperatures, than in others which have been more sparingly affected, I
have seen it begun in a fully impregnated egg, in a temperature of 52Â® Faur., at fifty-
three minutes after encounter with very mature spermatozoa. When it has attained its
