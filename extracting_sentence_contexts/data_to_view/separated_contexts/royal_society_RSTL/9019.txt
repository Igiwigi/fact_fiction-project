secondary movements persist ; for instead of © generally ceasing after a few moments ” 1
or © hours,” they usnally last for several days—in fact until the tisswes begin to

things equal, the unmutilated tisswes preserve their irritability longer than those
from which lithocysts have been remoyed; and 1 am able to agree with his state-
ment that the rate of the natural rhythm has a tendeney to bear an inverse pro-
portion to the size of the individual, though I find that size is not the only factor
in determining snch rate.
