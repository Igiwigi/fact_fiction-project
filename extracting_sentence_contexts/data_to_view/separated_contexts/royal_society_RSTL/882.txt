Secondly, the bubbles of gas made their appearance. Thirdly, the canals carrying red blood were observed :
these, while filled with carbonic acid gas, were not to be
distinguighed from the semi-transparent jelly which sur-
rounded them. As it is difficult to describe appearances of this kind, and
it is of importance that the fact of such appearances being
met with, should be well established, I requested Mr. Bauer
to make a drawing of a portion of the sore of which I have
attempted a description, after it had been exposed for nearly
Sixteen minutes ; and on the following day he made a draw-
ing of the same portion, showing the progress that had been
made, and that the canals formed on the first day, had on the
second become permanent tubes, and had been covered over
by a cuticle. These two drawings are annexed. *
