Among the Isoptera it can be seen in a condition similar to that which it
most likely passed through in the initial steps of its evolution. In certain primitive features Archotermopsis is unique among Termites, and is
more closely related to the North American genus Termopsis than to any other
living forms. Polymorphism in Termites is not adequately explained as being the direct or
indirect effects of special nutrition, nor does the theory of “castration parasitaire ”
explain the observed facts of the phenomenon. The Mendelian inheritance of
mutations appears to offer a reasonable solution of several of the outstanding
difficulties associated with the origin of pglymorphism, and the inheritance of
germinal characters in sterile castes. The “ exudation theory” of HoLMGREN is shown to be based upon premises which
have been insufficiently established, and the presence of his ‘“ exudation tissue” has
not been contirmed.
