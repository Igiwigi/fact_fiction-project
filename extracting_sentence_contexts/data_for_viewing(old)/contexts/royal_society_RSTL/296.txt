Voltaic electricity.

More recent investigations, and especially the admirable
researches of Sir H, Davy, have fully established the correct-
ness of these views, and have shewn that the different action
of the Voltaic pile and the electrical machine, depends chiefly
upon the quantity of electricity in the former being great,
while its intensity is inconsiderable, and vice versd.

In the following Lecture I shall have the honour of present-
ing the Royal Society with some new inquiries connected with
these objects of research, and have much pleasure in ad-
ducing facts which throw further light upon this interesting
department of chemical science, and which harmonize with
the opinions of the able philosophers alluded to.

When the flame of a candle is placed between two surfaces
in oppoxsite electrical states, the negative surface becomes most
heated: this circumstance was considered by Mr. CUTnBeRT-
SON as indicating the passage of electric fluid from the positive
to the negative surface.*
