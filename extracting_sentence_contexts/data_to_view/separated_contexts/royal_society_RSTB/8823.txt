The resulting protein of this transcript binds cyclos-
porin which could induce immunosuppression and also can
NSMCE 032 SLG9A3 0.039 interact with HIV-specific proteins. C1454 0.031 SLCBA2 0.025 Serum exosomes also contained high levels of Asp-GAC
ZNF880 0.027 SMARCB1 0.023 tRNA and miR-451la. Urine exosomes contained high levels
DNAJAG 0.026 7NF324 0.016 of the SDC4P pseudogene; in fact, many of the most highly
representative RNAs detected with this analysis are pseudo-
CSorf106 0.026 OTUDEB 0.015 genes. Poliseno et al. [18] show that some pseudogenes
ACGSL 0.025 SACMAIL 0.015 appear to have a role in oncogene regulation by serving as

ncRNA decoys for the canonical coding transcriptâ€”in particular,
the PTENP1 pseudogene acting as a miRNA decoy for
PTEN. This raises the notion that SDC4P is perhaps shuttled

mete TaD to other cells via exosomes and functions as a miRNA decoy
SDC4P 1.449 SDC4P 5.294 for SDC4.
