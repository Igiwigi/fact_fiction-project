take it seriously as a problem, expecting that gravitational degrees of freedom will induce a huge
quantum correction to the Higgs boson mass.

If we examine the correction to the Higgs boson mass shown in figure 1, we note an interesting
fact: the large corrections have an different sign for the first contribution compared to the second.
In fact, this is a property of quantum field theory: fermions give a negative sign, whereas bosons
give a positive sign. Supersymmetry provides a mathematical reason for a large cancellation
between the two diagrams, by imposing a symmetry on the quantum field theory between bosons
and fermions. For every fermion degree of freedom, supersymmetry imposes that there must be
a corresponding bosonic one, with identical mass and couplings. Thus, for instance in figure 1,
supersymmetry imposes tp = iy and 2 =é [3].

In fact, fermions in the Standard Model (the quarks and leptons), each have two degrees of
freedom (left and right handed, meaning that their spins are in the same direction or in opposite
direction to the motion of the particle). When we supersymmetrize the model, we end up with
two scalar bosons for each Standard Model fundamental fermion. The supersymmetric scalar


boson copies are prepended with an ‘s’ to denote their different spin. Thus, we talk of right-
and left-handed squarks and sleptons to be the spin 0 copies of the fermions. Spin 3 copies of
the Standard Model bosons have ‘ino’ appended to their name. In the minimal supersymmetric
extension of the Standard Model, we therefore have the following particles in addition to the
Standard Model ones:
