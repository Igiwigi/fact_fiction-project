which gives the special solutions, viz. in these the nodal conic has with the given curye

a 8pecial contact, consisting in that the node or intersection of the two lines lies on
the given curye. By way of illustration see Annex No. 2.
Bipoint-locus is more frequently necessary.

18. Suppose that the conic satisfies the condition of touching a given curve; the
parametric point is then situate on a onefold contact-locus (a, b, c, f. 9, k)"=0 (to fix
the ideas, if the given curve is of the order m and class 3, then the order 7 of the contact-
locus is =n+2m). The contact-locus of any given curye whatever Passes through the
Bipoint-locus; in fact to each point of the Bipoint-locus there corresponds a coincident,
line-pair, that is, a conic which (of course in a Special sense) touches the given curye
whatever it be; and not only 80, but inasmuch as we have a special contact at each
of the points of intersection of the given curye with the coincident line-pair regarded as
a single line, that is, in the case of a given curve of the m-th order, 92 special contacts,
the Bipoint-locus is a multiple curye on the corresponding contact-locus.
