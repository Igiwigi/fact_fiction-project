At this moment the still liquid part of the alloy
has reached the composition given by G. As the alloy continues to cool, the liquid
part traverses all the stages of temperature and composition corresponding to the
points on the branch GF, crystals of pure X erystallising during this period. Finally,
the residual liquid attains the composition of F, and the eutectic network forms at a
constant temperature. The facts that the alloys between H and G are the only ones
which plainly show three solid constitutents, and that the solid alloy at G is a

* January 30, 1900.—An alloy whose analysis gave 44°1 atoms of aluminium, which therefore must be close
to the transition point G, shows after prolonged etching with bromine water a very fine eutectic surrounding
isolated spots of the primary crystallisation of X. A photograph of this is given in fig. 25. Figs.
