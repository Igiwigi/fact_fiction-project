G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSAX.

(c.) As the fact of this wonderfully rhythmic response to faradaie irritation was
quite unexpected by me, and as it seemed to be a fact of great 8ignificance, T was led
vs as time permitted, First, I tried the effect
on the rhythm of progressively intensifying the sbrength of the faradaic current. I

to invesbigate it in as many of its bearings

found that with each increment of the current the rate of the rhythm was increased ;
and this up to the point at which the rhythm began to pass into tetanus due to gum-
mation of the snccessive contractions. Bub between the slowest rhythm obtainable by
minimal stimulation and the most rapid rhythm obtainable before the appearance of
tetanus, there were numerous degrees of rate to be observed.
