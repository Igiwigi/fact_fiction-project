energy densities were to be determined by such fields, so that this finite set of fields was ig
deemed to be sufficiently indicative for continuum purposes of the relevant discrete microscopic :8
configuration of atoms (say). This implies, in particular, that only the ‘current’ set of vector :f
fields is required to determine constitutive functions, and there is no associated ‘reference’ or 2
‘intermediate’ configuration, a priori. :

With these assumptions, which are reminiscent of early molecular theories of elasticity [3,4],

it became necessary to correlate features of the model with notions that are found useful : &
in later theories of continuous distributions of dislocations [5,6] and in engineering plasticity Dos
theories [7,8]. This was done by investigating and emphasizing the roles that the Burgers : =
vectors, the dislocation density and torsion tensors, and rigorous versions of elastic-plastic : yy
decomposition, play in the analysis of Davini’s kinematical model. In fact, there is one central 2
question in that analysis which leads directly to the importance of the above notions—it is very aes
simply stated: if two crystal states are given, that is if two sets of vector fields (defined over _
different regions of R°) are given, then how does one decide if there is a macroscopic deformation, : 8
mapping one region to the other, which also maps one set of fields to the other. To discuss this : ~
question, it was necessary to consider quantities of higher order (in the derivatives of the lattice :B
vector fields) than the Burgers vector, dislocation density tensor, etc., though it was shown that ig

only a finite number of such objects were necessary for the results obtained—these quantities are
certain directional derivatives of the dislocation density tensor.

In summary, the model has many points of contact with other continuum models of materials
which allow inelastic behaviour, the central geometrical object (a set of vector fields) is rather
