or at all events a great number of metals, the positive terminal was more heated
than the negative, and that the portion of the crossed wire which was positive be-
came more incandescent than that of the negative, from the greater heating effect
developed at the point when the disruptive discharge took place. I suggested as
an explanation of this phenomenon, the possibility that in air, as in water, or other
electrolyte, the oxygen or electro-negative element was determined to the positive
termina], and that from the union of the metal with that oxygen a greater heating
effect was developed. This, with some other impressions, I mentioned in a letter to
my friend Dr. Scn6xBE1N, not intended for publication, but which shortly afterwards
found its way into print*.

Though by no means thinking that this explanation was in every respect satis-
factory, there were many arguments in its favour, and the fact strongly impressed
my mind as evincing a very striking difference in character between the effect of
the discharge at the positive and negative terminals, and as presenting, as far as it
went, a distant analogy to the effect of electrolysis.

In the year 1848, while experimenting with Mr. Gass10T with a nitric acid battery
consisting of 500 well insulated cells, I made the following experiment :â€”Two wires
of platinum Z;th of an inch in diameter, forming the terminals of the battery, were
immersed in distilled water ; the negative wire was then gradually withdrawn until it
reached a point a quarter of an inch distant from the surface of the water. A cone
of blue flame was now perceptible, the water forming its base, and the point of the
wire its apex ; the wire rapidly fused, and became 80 brilliant that the cone of flame
could be no longer perceived, and the globule of fused platinum was apparently 81us-
