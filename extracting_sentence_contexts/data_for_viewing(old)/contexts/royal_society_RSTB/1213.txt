vantage which the method might offer for the investigation of the functions of a
pérve centre by the study of the actual changes in its cells.

> SUMMARY.

It is obviously impossible to formulate with sufficient accuracy many general
danclusions as to the mode in which the functional activity of the spinal nerve centres
i generated and discharged, but we cannot refrain from pointing out that the
geetrical method supplies many ways of investigating this very important and
Gficult subject, and further that it throws most unexpected light on the obscure
fuestions relating to the working of the several parts of nerve centres.

&Most prominently stand out two principal facts :—

PU) The kinetogenetic portion* of a spinal nerve centre is probably the afferent
= side. (See Section 2.)

E(2.) The part in which the delay and diminution of impulses passing through is

ESI effected is the efferent side of such a centre with the field of conjunction.
3 (See Section 2.)

= The consideration of these facts, unexpected as they were, shows clearly that the
iiterprotation by Bastrant of sensori-motor nerve phenomena is probably the most
Srrect yet advanced. The basis of that interpretation, namely, the doctrine of
