close of the experiment, it appeared that
four-fifths of the oxygen had united with the carbonic oxide,
and only one-fifth with the hydrogen. When four volumes
of hydrogen, two of carbonic oxide, and one of oxygen, were
similarly treated, the hydrogen, notwithstanding its greater
proportional volume, was $till found to have taken only one-
fifth of the oxygen, while four-fifths had combined with the
carbonic oxide. These facts show that at temperatures be=-
tween goo? and - 340% FAnRENarir, the affinity of carbonic
oxide for oxygen is decidedly superior to that of hydrogen;
as, from the experiments before described, appears to be the
case, also, at common temperatures. But a similar distribution of oxygen, between carbonic
oxide and hydrogen, does not- take- place, when those three
gases are fired together by the electric spark.
