]. Introduction

This is the second part of our introductory survey of mathematical cosmology. The first part is
contained in volume 1 of the Theme Issue ‘100 Years of mathematical cosmology’ and is separately
published covering the period of development of mathematical cosmology starting from 1917
until 1980. In this second part, we cover the period since 1980, and provide brief descriptions
of the emergence, development, importance and interconnections of most major subfields of
theoretical mathematical cosmology, such as modified gravity and dark energy, inflationary,
quantum, string, M-theoretic and brane cosmologies, wormholes, measures, stability, genericity
and topology. Here, as in Part A, we focus on key theoretical discoveries as well as fundamental
ideas that were to become (or, in fact, may become) instrumental in the development of the whole
field. At the end of this paper, we include the contents of the individual invited contributions to
volume 2 of the Theme Issue ‘The future of mathematical cosmology’.

2. Third period, 1980-2000

In this section, we discuss the following novel ideas that emerged in this period:

— Inflationary cosmology

— The multiverse

— Wave function of the universe
