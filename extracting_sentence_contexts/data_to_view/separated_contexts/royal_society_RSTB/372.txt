In the considerably lighter
results of the former (I.) we probably see the proof that in the shorter stage, IL., the
influences are really more potent than in ILI., which is considerably longer. Similarly
Stage II. was passed in black surroundings in the case of III., and its results are
darker than those of I. In fact, in both I. and III. the colour in which Stage IJ. was
passed predominates in the result, or rather it is more accurate to say that the gilt
surroundings produce more effect in Stages I. and II. than in Stage IIT. alone.
