Diagram A,—Insortion of a pair of septa after each pair of mesenteries (hypothetic) would result in
the eclocelic and entoowlic position of septa (primary cycle 12). Diagram B.—Insertion of a pair of septa after every two pairs of mesenteries (“ pause” of Lacaze
Durarrs) would result in the entocelic position only of the septa (primary cycle 6), m. main
septum ; ¢. counterseptum ; a. alar septa; (mesenteries after Lacaze Duvniers). 288 DR. MARIA M, OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND

frequently pointed out, in complete agreement with the fundamental facts in the
pinnate insertion of septa in primitive Madreporaria. The three “ pauses” in embryonic development, occurring after the appearance of
each two pairs of the first twelve mesenteries, have been presumed by one or two
authors to represent the interval during which septal invaginations formed. I have
indicated in diagram A above, that there may have been, primitively, types in
which septa appeared after each single pair of mesenteries.
