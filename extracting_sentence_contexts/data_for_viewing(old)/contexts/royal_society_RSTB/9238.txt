We now consider another key dimension of creativity, novelty,
and the ability to perceive it. In Western culture, as we argue
above, the attribution of creativity entails the attribution of
novelty—various authors have argued that the human creative
drive is the search for novelty [12], or, differently termed, curios-
ity [13]. While this is not the case in all cultures, the fact remains
that novelty detection is a feature of creative behaviour—
whether it is a feature to be valued or (in some contexts)
suppressed. Regardless of one’s response to novelty, the fact
that one can respond to it means that it can be detected, and
we propose that this is a fundamental component of creative be-
haviour. It is to be noted, however, that too much novelty
prevents recognition, a fact embodied in the famous Wundt
curve of hedonic response to novelty [14,15]: the inverted-U
shape captures the notion that not enough variation is boring,
while too much is unpleasantly incomprehensible, yielding a
sweet spot in between. This is illustrated in figure 1.

Novelty detection is a requirement for noticing changes in
the environment, a feature all animals need for survival.
