interesting fact that in the Jurassic fronds of this species every pinnule appears to be
fertile, even the smallest segments at the base of the pinn, exactly as in Matonia
pectinata.*

M. Wiesneri, Krasser.

This species, from Cretaceous (Cenomanian) rocks of Moravia, was founded by
Krassert for some fern fronds with a Matonia-like habit. M. Wiesneri agrees
closely with the Malayan fern in the form of pinnules and in the occurrence of
anastomosing veins below the sorus; the sorus appears to be indusiate and circular.
KRaAssEr gives figures of a pinnule of the recent species,{ but, like other authors, he
overlooks the fact that the lateral veins are often connected by arching branches.
The Moravian species differs from M. GÃ©pperti and agrees with Matonia pectinata in
the small number of sori on the fertile segments.

Without entering into further discussion as to the taxonomy of Mesozoic ferns allied
to Matonia, we may briefly summarise the distribution of probable representatives of
the Matoninew. There can be little doubt that a critical comparison of the specimens
described by various authors from Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous localities, and
referred to such genera as Laccopteris, Gutbiera, Phlebopteris, Microdictyon, Matoni-
dium, and others, would yield valuable results from the point of view of the past
history of the Matoninez.

The geological range of the genera referred to extends from Rheetic to Cretaceous
