For the deforestation analyses, we calculate the

slope of each 30m land parcel. For the socioeconomic
analyses, we calculate the average slope (in degrees) based
on the slope of each 100 m land parcel within a canton. The fact that protected areas have the potential to affect
multiple units (parcels or cantons) raises concerns regarding
the statistical precision of our ATT estimates. The concern is
that if the outcome is systematically correlated across units

according to some grouping, then the precision of our estimates (ii) Distance to major city
will be overstated. This is a particular concern in the deforesta- Distance to city captures the variation in the opportunity cost
tion analysis because we are not able to observe the relevant of land and deforestation pressure as a function of distance to
management units, which is one of the reasons that we ran- major markets [16,30].
