Z Vig. 44 isa transverse section of a 8mall branch from one of the bullions above the two-
FS foot coal at Oldham ; and fig. 45 is a vertical section of the same specimen. Its diameter
Ei is half an inch, of which the medulla occupies nearly '19. This latter tissue not only
£ divides into the usual disks, «, but each one of these again exhibits the strongest tendency
6 to split up into numerous yet thinner layers, each one of which consists apparently of a
S single horizontal layer of cells*. It is obvious that in this instance the medullary cells
S have arranged themselyes in successive vertical series of horizontal layers, and thus pre-
& disposed the tissue to break up into thin lamine along the lines intervening between

® In pointing out the fact that the Balsam fir (Abies balsamen) has a discoid pith, Dr, Daws0x 8ays :—
+ This modern Sternbergic is not produced by the merc breaking of the celular tissue transversely by elonga-
tion of the fibre, but, as I pointed out many years ago in the case of the Coal-formation Sternbergia (* Cana-
dian Naturalist and Geologist,” 1857), is a true organic partitioning of the pith by diaphragms of denser cells
opposite the nodes, as in Ceeropia peltata and some species of Ficus. The transverse diaphragms are com-
posed of denser cells flattened horizontally, and they are, as in Sternbergia, accompanied by constrictions of the
medullary cylinder,” —Nature, May 15, 1873.

In my Sternbergia deseribed above I find no evidence of two kinds of cells ; but there is an unmistakallo
horizontal stratification of them which obyiously approximates closely to Dr. Daw:
