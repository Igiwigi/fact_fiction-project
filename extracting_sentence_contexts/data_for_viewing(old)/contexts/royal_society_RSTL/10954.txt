The antero-lateral vomers have coalesced with: the palatine plates of the premaxil-
laries, lengthening them considerably ; and the postero-lateral plates have coalesced
with the outside of the forks of the main vomer (Plate 21, figs. 7-9), the latter is a
long thickly carinate bone, bluntly pointed in front,

That which is most important to remark upon in the ossified nasal labyrinth itself is
that the various turbinals—nasal, inferior, middle, 8uperior (7.tb., 5.th,, m.tb., u.tb.) —
are transformed into a light and porous kind of bone, but when the investing bones—
nasals, frontals, &c.—are peeled off them the wall is found to have been absorbed ; the
8ucceedaneum to this wall is the outer investing plate. Hence, these coils, when
stripped before they are anchylosed to the investing plates, have large vacuities
between them, displaying their folds. This is due to the fact that the 8econdary folds
or turbinals, ossify first, and only 80 much of the primary wall becomes ossified as gave
origin to these out-growths ; the intermediate 8paces are absorbed, being pressed upon
and defended by the superficial bony plates,

The pre-olfactory region occupied by the inferior or maxillary turbinal (Plate 20,
figs. 9, 10, front and side views) is very large, and this part is exceedingly complicated,
as indeed it, is in most of the Eutheria ; in the Rabbit and the Dog, as well as in the
Hedgehog.

The lower jaw (Plate 21, figs. 5, 6) is fairly intermediate between that of a Marsupial
and that of a high Mammal ; the three proximal processes are all large and well formed,
and the lower, or angular, is 80mewhat inflected as well as thickened.
