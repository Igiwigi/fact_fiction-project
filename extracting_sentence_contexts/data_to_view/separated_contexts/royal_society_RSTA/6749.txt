For a system characterized by N degrees of
freedom there are N such values.

2. Now in vibration theory (cf., for example, Southwell 1940, Chap. vi) the natural
frequencies of vibration of a system, i.e. the Eigenwerte of = 2mn, can be calculated
from the condition that p? as given by

pr =B/X (4)

has a value which is stationary for all permitted variations of the displacements, 8 and
& being essentially positive functions representative of the total potential and kinetic
energies. Comparing (3) with (4), we see that when , is essentially positive (and this
is usually the fact in cases of elastic instability*) the two classes of problem are exactly
analogous. Accordingly any method devised for the solution of vibration problems can
also be applied to the problems of this paper; and from a practical standpoint the latter
are more simple, in that usually only the smallest critical value of P is wanted, whereas
in vibration problems it is often necessary to determine frequencies higher than the
gravest. In particular, *Rayleigh’s principle’ is immediately applicable to problems of elastic
stability, also the relaxation technique which was based on that principle in Part VI
of this series (Pellew & Southwell 1940).
