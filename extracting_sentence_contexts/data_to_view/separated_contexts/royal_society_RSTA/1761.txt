Spatially
averaged relative reductions are largest for SOz (30% overall), followed by NH3 (25%) and O3
(13%), with somewhat smaller reductions if weighted by population and for the urban grid cells. Surprisingly, the UK average effect is very small for NO2; the spatial pattern of figure 2 reveals
that vegetation suppresses NO) in source areas which is approximately balanced by increases
in NOz in rural areas, especially in areas with large forest cover. This is partly due to the fact
that forest soils are associated with larger NO emissions than desert sand, but other interactions
