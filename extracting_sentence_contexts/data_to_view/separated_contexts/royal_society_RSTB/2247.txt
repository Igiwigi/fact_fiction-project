The dogs


184 DR. R. KENNEDY ON THE RESTORATION OF

operated upon appear to have been very little affected by the division and crossing
of their nerves of flexion, for on the second day after the operation, with both
median and ulnar cut on the left side high in the limb, and with the ulnar cut on
the right side at the level of the elbow, there was very little evidence of any
paralysis or even awkwardness. Before the end of the first week the closest
scrutiny could detect no awkwardness of movement, except possibly when the
animal was running rapidly up-stairs. They allude to the fact that the median
and ulnar supply synergic muscles have a close origin, and that a more interesting
experiment would be the crossing of the musculo-spiral and ulnar, and think that
such would be successful.

CUNNINGHAM (16) conducted two sets ot experiments on the fore-limbs of dogs. He invariably made a double crossing, and the precaution taken to prevent confluent
reunion of all the nerve ends was to wrap round each union a layer of fascia. In
his first set of experiments he crossed the median with the ulnar, and found, as did
Howe tt and Huser, that this operation inconvenienced the animals very little,
but in all his dogs there was persistent over-extension.
