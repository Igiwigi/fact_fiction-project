The original dipolar interactions between spins are translated
into effective Coulomb interactions between these monopoles. This interaction is therefore of an
energetic origin, contrary to its entropic counterpart originating from an averaging over the many
degenerate configurations compatible with defects placed at fixed positions.

(b) Intrinsic versus emergent gauge charge

The dumbbell model has led us to the important distinction between two contributions to the
monopoles’ interactions. In fact, these two contributions correspond to two kinds of charges in
our system.

(ii) in the dumbbell picture the missing spins yield sites on the dual lattice with odd coordination, which therefore cannot a)
be charge neutral for discrete spins; (iii) at low temperatures only these are the relevant degrees of freedom once the Dw
fluctuating background of charge-neutral tetrahedra (denoted in green) has been integrated out. These correspond to [5
‘ghost spins’ at random locations given by the locations of the missing spins! (b) Phase diagram proposed for diluted [3
spin ice. The emergent gauge charges exist due to the cooperative behaviour of the whole system, which
on account of the non-trivial ground state correlations, leads to entropically interacting magnetic
monopoles.
