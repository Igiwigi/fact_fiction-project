Owing to the shape of the individual plates, and the fact that the lumen of the proven-
triculus narrows posteriorly, the entrance gaps to the sieve diminish posteriorly (figure
20, sv.). As a result of the divergence of the apices of the plates already mentioned, however,
the exit gaps expand posteriorly (figure 20, sv.’). The apical setae of the plates emphasize
this condition by being curved away from the exit gaps posteriorly and arching over the
rear of the entrance gaps, where they interlock with the setae of the adjacent double row
of plates (figure 14). Moreover, numerous setae arise from the wall of the proventriculus
at the extreme posterior ends of the entrance gaps, and interlock with the apical setae of
the plates (figure 14). These setae are mentioned by Miiller. The entrance gaps to the
sieve are therefore closed posteriorly by a dense felt-work of setae.

Anteriorly the exit gaps from the sieve apparatus are closed owing to the fact that each
double row of plates takes its origin anteriorly in a prominent cushion-like swelling at the
level of the junction between the crop and proventriculus. There are therefore eight of these
cushions (figures 14, 15 and 16, c.sp.) disposed regularly around the entrance to the pro-
ventriculus. Each cushion bears a characteristic armature. Anteriorly it consists only of

slight denticle-like prominences (figure 14), but more posteriorly these prominences are
produced into definite short spines (figures 14, 15). More posteriorly still the spines are
greatly elongated, so that projecting from the rear of each cushion occurs a dense mass of
