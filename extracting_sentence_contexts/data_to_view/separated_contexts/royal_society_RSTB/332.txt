the average ratio of length
to breadth is 1 : 0°657, and in 30 shells varying in length between 21 mm. and 17 mm. this average ratio is 1: 0°665. It is a remarkable fact that in the case of these shells
the increased proportional length is almost as much marked among the small shells as
it is amongst the large ones, and, as may be seen in Table VI. (a), this feature is
present fairly uniformly in nearly all the individuals. Another character of these fresh-water shells is the frequent occurrence of specimens
with the free ventral margins of the shell bent inwards, as shown in Plate 26, fig.
