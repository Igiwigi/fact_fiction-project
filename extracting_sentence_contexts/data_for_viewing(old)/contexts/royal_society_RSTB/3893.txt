Terebratulina lata to Micraster cor-testudinarium—upon the eastern gradual
slope of the Greensand bank of Devon.

Renewed subsidence took place after the olaster planus uplift and continued for
a prolonged period. It was during this prolonged subsidence that the greater part
of the chalk of the mid-zones was deposited.

The Fauna of the Mid-Zones—

A distinct break in the fauna appears to occur between the low and mid-zones.
This is due— ;

(1) To the fact that there appears to be a considerable thickness of barren chalk
above the beds which occupy the lower quarter of the zone of Micraster cor-anguinum.
_ Consequently when the Asteroids are again met with in any abundance some interval
of time has elapsed.

(2) To some acceleration in elaboration. In the “mid” zones many Cretaceous
starfish reach their acme of elaboration, as, e.g., Crateraster quinqueloba, Mitraster
rugatus, and Tholaster ocellatus, and there appears to be an acceleration in
elaboration as forms approach their highest point of development.

The general succession of the fauna is very similar in §.E. England, N.E.
England, and N. France. Elaboration appears to have been generally uniform
throughout this area. Nevertheless one can perceive that there was not complete
