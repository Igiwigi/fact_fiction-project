While this may seem to conflict with a simple scaling argument, it may actually
be qualitatively consistent with the scaling curves in figure 3: above a dew point of 20°C, the
scaling curves do show a decrease in the sensitivity of hourly precipitation extremes to dew point
temperature. We think this is likely a physical effect as the flattening of the scaling curves was also
obtained in observed precipitation from Hong Kong, where there is ample data in the high dew
point temperature regime [7]. Finally, we note that Egcm does not show a decreased sensitivity


beyond a dew point of 20°C, and this may well be related to the fact that Egcy is rather cold Ee
(and dry) and therefore has too little data in this high dew point temperature regime to derive

the scaling factors (see also the dew point temperature ranges for each percentile at the bottom of 3
figure 3). oS

The scaling factors for the high-altitude area (greater than 400 m) reveal a surprisingly similar : gS
behaviour for all three experiments (figure 4 def). They all show approximately CC behaviour ey
up to a dew point of 15°C for all percentiles and higher scaling factors for the highest percentile, : 2
peaking at 12-13% per degree at a dew point of 18-20°C. Beyond that dew point temperature 1a
scaling factor appears to decrease, most visible for Egy and least visible for Egcm (see also 2B
electronic supplementary material for sensitivity to interpolation). :3

Admittedly, the analysis here is somewhat sensitive to the technical details of the scaling S
analyses (bin width and smoothing from the interpolation; see electronic supplementary material) :3
and the representative dew point temperature change used to derive the scaling factors.
