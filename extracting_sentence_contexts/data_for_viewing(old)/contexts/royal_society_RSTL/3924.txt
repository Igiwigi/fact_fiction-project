Salts of Lead.

In the Jast four experiments half quantities were taken, but the results are all
reduced to the common standard in the fifth column, After the precipitate had snb-
Sided, the clear solution above was found to be highly alkaline, capable of precipitating
freely the salts of lead, and containing at the same time a small quantity of lead in
Solution. These facts are well known, and prove that the preceding numbers repre-
Sent only a part of the heat due to the substitution of potash for the oxide of lead.
Their accordance shows that the salts of lead, when similarly treated with caustic
potash, give equal quantities of heat.
