For simplicity, the small deviation from the bifurcation point, represented by the second term
on the right-hand side, is given only by the linear term with small bifurcation parameter €; the
nonlinear part of F(X) is abbreviated as N(X). These two terms constitute the perturbation acting
on the linear system at the criticality. The Jacobian Lp has a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues
+iw, and the corresponding eigenvectors are denoted as ug and ug, respectively, where the bar
denotes complex conjugate; the real part of all the other eigenvalues are assumed negative. Thus,
the unperturbed system X=[pX is neutrally stable. Its solution as f > 00, which is called the
neutral solution, is given by

Xp =Ae’ug + Ae aig, (2.2)
where @ = wt and A is an arbitrary complex amplitude. Note that e'’ ug and its complex conjugate
are the eigenfunctions of the operator Lo - «(d/d6@) with zero eigenvalue. This fact will be used
later.

As was stated in the introductory section, the basic idea of reduction is to reinterpret the
arbitrary parameter A appearing in the time-asymptotic solution as a dynamical variable and try
to absorb the effect of perturbation into the slow evolution of A. At the same time, the change of
the solution form from (2.2), however small it may be, is inevitable. Thus, a small correction term
must be added to the right-hand side of (2.2) to express the true solution. The crucial assumption
here is that this correction term is given by a functional of the neutral solution. As a result, the
true solution takes the form

X=Aeluy + Ae Pig + 0 (A, A, 8). (2.3)
