5. Ornstein—Uhlenbeck semigroups on Banach spaces

Many of the results of §3 have been extended to the case where X is a separable Banach space. In
fact, refs [9,10,15,17,19,20,32,34,36,38] deal with the Banach space case. A survey of the state of the
art up to 2003 is in ref. [9].

As in §4, Qe.2(X*,X) is a symmetric positive operator, and A:D(A)C X—X is the
infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup e'4 on X. As in the Hilbert case,
the basic assumption of this section is that for every t > 0 the operator Q; defined by (4.2) is the
covariance of a Gaussian measure 1, and in this case, the Ornstein—Uhlenbeck semigroup T(t) is
defined by (4.5).

If Q itself is a covariance and A = —I, T(t) is the classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup of §3,
provided y is the centred Gaussian measure on X with covariance 2Q.

As in the Hilbert case, it is the transition semigroup of a stochastic differential equation in X,
