The maximum ordinates of the first, second, and third associated pulses stand to
one another almost exactly in the ratio 3:2:1. It is easily seen in fact in fig. 2
that the summits of corresponding first, second, and third associated pulses lie nearly
on straight lines, which, if produced, would cut the zero line at points answering
roughly to days +110, This linearity in the summits cannot well represent the true
phenomenon exactly, because it would imply that no finite associated pulse existed
except those shown in fig. 2, whereas there can be but little doubt that if data existed
for a really long series of years, pulses could be recognised considerably beyond the
