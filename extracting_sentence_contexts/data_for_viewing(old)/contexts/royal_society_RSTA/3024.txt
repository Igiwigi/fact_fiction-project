independence. When the distance with respect to chemical equilibrium increases, so do chemical :
affinities that stimulate the growth of some fluctuations that diffusion can no longer precisely a]
dampen because the thermodynamic forces of diffusion are independent from chemical affinities; DN
the increases of the latter have no influence on diffusion fluxes. 2S

(b) On intrinsic versus extrinsic dissipative structures

A property that explains the enormous interest granted to chemical dissipative structures is their
strictly dissipative character. Reversible transports of matter that are essential in hydrodynamics
are replaced by dissipative strictly irreversible diffusion processes. This is appealing, for example,
in the case of cellular systems the biochemistry of which is in many instances taking place under
strictly dissipative conditions like those met in open, isothermal reaction—diffusion systems.
More fundamental and important for such biological systems is then the fact that the spatial
symmetry breaking phenomena observed in reaction-diffusion systems are intrinsic. On the
contrary, Bénard cells are extrinsic dissipative structures: their size is determined by external
environmental factor like boundary properties and the thickness of the fluid layer considered.
The spatial wavelengths observed with chemical spatio-temporal dissipative structures are fixed
by expressions of the form \/D/k, where D has the dimensions of a diffusion coefficient and
k is the inverse of a time characteristic of the chemistry; in other words, these quantities are
specifically fixed by parameters that only depend on the irreversible processes taking place. In
2d or 3d-systems, an enormous variety of intrinsic spatio-temporal morphologies and localization
effects becomes possible. The determination of the associated bifurcation mechanisms, relative
stability, sensibility to internal and external fluctuations are giving rise to a large set of
fascinating problems.
