increase in 2007 and 2014 [7].

Mitigation of anthropogenic CH, emissions is considered an effective way to slow the rate of
global warming in addition to CO2 emission reductions to minimize the warming magnitude [8].
Substantial emission cuts along the oil and gas (O&G) industry supply chain can be achieved
at no net monetary cost [9], especially when also factoring in the social cost of CHg [10]. In
fact, governments around the world including Canada, Colombia, Mexico and the USA have
already committed to substantial CH4 emission mitigation from the O&G industry supply chain
in parallel to CHy intensity targets set by that industry [11].

In addition to quantifying the total CH4 emission magnitudes, understanding their individual
sources and mechanisms is key for developing effective mitigation strategies and for drafting
adequate regulations as well as for validating whether reduction targets are in fact being met.
Scientific methods exist, are being further developed and have been applied around the world
to detect, locate and quantify emitters across the emission size distribution to support such
mitigation [12,13].

One of the so-called unconventional gas production sources is coal seam gas (CSG), sometimes
also labelled coalbed CH4. Complete global production data of CSG are usually not publicly
available, but CSG accounted for about 5% of natural gas production in the USA throughout the
2010s [14], 24% of Australia’s gas production in 2018 [15,16] and rapidly increasing amounts in
China (the world’s largest coal producer), for which reliable CSG production data are difficult to
obtain [17]. Given the operational differences between CSG and other forms of O&G production
(including dry and wet gas production from conventional and shale formations), it is essential
to understand CH, emissions from CSG production alone. This includes the fact that CSG fields
