epiderm in the longitudinal section, but I find them in the tangential section of the latter
tissue.

From the above description it will be obvious that though Favularia has its own
peculiarities, especially as seen in the varied character of the cells constituting the me-
dullary axis, and in the apparent though not certain absence of all medullary yessels,
its general structure indicates its close affinity with the Lepidodendroid plants ; we have
in both the same thick prosenchymatous bark with its thin tubular layer at the inner
surface of the epiderm passing into the regular parenchyma of the petioles. These facts
are important because of the obscurity which yet rests upon the history of the true
Sigillaris. No one has questioned the close affinity of Favularia and Sigillaria: the
very prominent cicatrices of the former are but exaggerated representatives of the slightly
projecting leaf-scars of the latter.

A remarkable specimen of Favularia, which appears to have borne cones, will be
described in the sequel of this memoir.

Considering the abundance of Sigillarize in the Coal-measures, it is maryellous that
indisputable specimens displaying their internal organization should be 80 rare; but 8uch
is the case. After years of search I have only met with three specimens, of the Sigillarian
character of which there can be no doubt. One of these is a portion of the epidermal
