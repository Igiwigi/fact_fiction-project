been proved to occur under certain experimental conditions.

As far as the author is aware, nothing parallel to this conversion of one aaineist of
Diaporthe perniciosa into another has been recorded for any other Ascomycete. The
only phenomenon at all comparable with it is the conversion of a haploid mycelium of
the basidiomycete, Coprinus lagopus, into the diploid state in the presence of diploid
hyphe of the same fungus, as described by BuLLEr (1931). In both processes a minute
fragment of one mycelium is sufficient to change a large growth of the other; the
converted mycelium assumes the character of the one responsible for the change ; the
converting influence spreads very quickly and at approximately equal rates in both
(20-04 per minute in Coprinus lagopus and 17-5 uw per minute through young DH,, if
the course taken is assumed to be straight) ; and young mycelium responds more readily
than the old. These similarities in experimental facts suggest a correspondence in the
mechanism of the two conversions. BULLER (1931) puts forward the theory, partly based
on the results of LEnrELpt’s (1923) cytological work with T'yphula erythropus, that when
a diploid mycelium of Coprinus lagopus comes in contact with a haploid, fusion occurs
and a nucleus of the opposite sex from that of the haploid nuclei passes from the diploid
to the haploid, becomes associated with a nucleus of the latter and thus “ diploidizes ”
one cell. The “ stranger ” nucleus then divides. One daughter nucleus travels through
the hypha, enters the next cell and “ diploidizes ” that. The process is repeated in all
directions and from all points of fusion until the former haploid mycelium has become
diploid throughout.

The mechanism by which fusion between the hyphe of the two strains of Diaporthe
permciosa leads to conversion of DH; to DH, is obscure. It may be the passage of a
