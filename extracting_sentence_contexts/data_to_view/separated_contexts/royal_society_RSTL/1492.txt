I shall conclude this paper by stating the
grounds of this/ suspicion, and noticing a circumstance which
appears to be of considerable importance, both in relation to
the construction of barometers and thermometers, and to the
analysis of gaseous bodies. Recently distilled mercury that
has been afterwards boiled and cooled in the atmosphere, and
which presents a perfectly smooth surface ina barometer
tube, emits air when strongly heated in vacuo, and that in
quantities -sufficient to cover the whole interior of the tube
with globules; and on keeping the stop-cock of one of the
tubes used in the experiments on the mercurial vacuwn open
for some hours, it was found that the lower stratum of mer-
cury had imbibed air, for when heated in vacuo, it emitted
it distinctly from a space of a quarter of an inch of the co-
lumn; smaller quantities were disengaged from the next part
of the column; and its production ceased at about an inch
high in the tube. There is great reason to believe, that this
air exists in mercury in the same invisible state as in water,
that is distributed through its pores; and the fact shows the
necessity of long| boiling the mercury in barometer-and ther-
mometer tubes, and the propriety of exposing as small a sur-
face of the mercury as possible to the air. Itmay explain,
likewise, the difference of the heights of the mercury in diffe-
rent barometers; and seems to indicate the propriety of re-
boiling the mercury in these instruments after a certain lapse
of time. Zhitos.
