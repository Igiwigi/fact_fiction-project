The development of the spheeridium shows conclusively that it is really a reduced and
modified spine. The foundation of the globular portion consists of six (in some cases
five) prongs, similar to those of a typical spine but greatly reduced in length. The
irregularity exhibited by the base (fig. 10, a-e) is due either to the total loss of a varying
number of rays or to the fact that some of the rays remain abortive. The stalk of
the sphxridium, which corresponds to the expanded basal portion of a spine, shows the
same tendency to reduction. It always remains narrower than the upper portion,
and no branches are developed corresponding to y and yâ€™ (compare figs. 6 and 7, with
10, f).
