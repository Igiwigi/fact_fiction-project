EZ only another example, under the guise of an unusual variation, of the typical segmental
E organ as now described in the Annelids in general.
= In Sigation, Pholoe and Polynoe, this system occurs under precisely the same charac-
Y ters as those just indicated in Aphrodita. If there be any difference, it is marked only
= by the number and complexness of the branches (fig. 27 A, B).
Z The blood-vascular system in all the Aphroditade is almost, if not entirely wanting ;
A upon this special point the author has instituted numerous and careful observations.
In no instance whatever amongst this family has he ever succeeded in detecting the
faintest trace of a blood-vascular system, except in Pholoe inornata. In this little
Aphrodite a vessel may be seen, carrying a colourless fluid, in contact with and parallel
to the ventral nervous chord, slowly undulating with pulsations. Practically this fluid-
system is wanting in the Aphroditade ; it can therefore play no part in the generative
functions. As will be snbsequently shown, this fact, added to a mass of others, will
compel the morphologist to admit a close zoological affinity between the aberrant

Annelids and the Asteriadea and Echinidea among the Echinoderms.

This completes the anatomical history and morphological relations of the segmental
system of organs in the class Annelida.

It now remains to speak of the leading points thus established. The demonstration
