The “sanitary” arrangements
during the intervening period after the formation of the first ctenidium may be presumed
to resemble those of the members of the Archaeogastropoda, which have a single
ctenidium supplied by fresh water from under the left shell margin. After use, the
water passes away above the anus on the right side of thespallial cavity. The fact that the topographical right ctenidium and the hypobranchial gland of
that side, which secretes mucus to clean the respiratory chamber, do not appear until
a month later than those organs of the definitive left side appears to be significant. Both ctenidia in Haliotis are bipectinate, whereas in Scissurella the definitive left one
is monopectinate; in the adult Haliotis, as in Pleurotomaria and Scissurella, the definitive

right ctenidium is invariably somewhat smaller than the left one, and this difference in
size also applies to the hypobranchial glands.
