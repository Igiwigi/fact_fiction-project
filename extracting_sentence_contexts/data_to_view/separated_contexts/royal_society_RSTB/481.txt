Of the two, respiration is almost invariably affected first, 7.¢., in rhythm and extent. The arrest of respiration, however, ought not to be regarded as strictly comparable to
the condition of arrest of the heart, since the latter implies excitation of a bulbar
centre, whereas arrest of respiration means paralysis, i.e., an effect of much greater
importance. Hence the fact that the two are arrested simultaneously (see Tracing XXIII), or
even the respiration a little after the heart (see Tracing X.), only goes to show that
the respiratory centre is hy far the more sensitive, and consequently, as an index of
pressure, more delicate than the heart’s action,

A. (3.) The variation in the effects observed to be produced by section of the vagi. We have made a large number of observations after preliminary section of the vagi. The effect of division of one vagus was practically nil.t When it was pulled on
