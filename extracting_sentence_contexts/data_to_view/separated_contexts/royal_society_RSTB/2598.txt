Nicuoxson, while distinguishing those two
Palaozoic types, carefully shows how they merge in one another; and so do their
descendants. Summarizing (¢f also p. 318), the above considerations, I may say that T look upon
the columella and pali of Turbinolids as the homologue of the tabulate area of
Zaphrentids, the septa representing the originally short septa of Zaphrentids in the
limited dissepimental area. Correlated with their shortness, is, I believe, the fact
that they never developed in the mature condition a well-marked area of divergence,
and that their axes of calcification are usually very obliquely placed, or point almost
horizontally inwards to the central area. Further, the “sunken calicles” characteristic of the coenenchymate allies of the
Turbinolidee are also correlated with the smaller prominence of the septa and the
divection of the axes of calcification. The primitive shape of the calyx of Zaphrentys
and its Paleozoic relatives have been the main cause of the immense functional
activity demanded of the mural and epithecal rim in their descendants (vide antea,
p- 263).
