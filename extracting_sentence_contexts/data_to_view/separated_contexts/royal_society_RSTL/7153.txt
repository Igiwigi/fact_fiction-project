The proximal face (A) presents the usnal arrangement of foss for the lodgment of
muscles and ligaments; the surfaces for the attachment of muscles being here chiefly
provided by the two rounded lamelle which project from the upper or ventral margin
of the segment (d, d, figs. A,B). The distal face (B) shows a peculiarity of conformation
which we have not yet encountered ; for it is unmarked by any prominent ridges or fos80,
being in fact almost flat, except that it presents a series of slightly elevated ridges with
alternating furrows, which radiate from the opening of the central canal towards the
dorsal margin. The union of this face with the opposite face of the Fourth Brachial
(59, figs. Â©, D, E) constitutes what was designated by Professor J. MULLER a 8Y2Y9Y-
