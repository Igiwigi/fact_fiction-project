upper part of the specimen ; and on seyeral of the sacs there are papillze, which may
be regarded as indications of the bases of pseudopodia. The drawing 80 faithfully
represents the original, that further description is unnecessary*. On this fossil I
cannot forbear to observe, that this extraordinary preservation of the soft de-
licate body of an animalcule invisible to the unassisted eye, through the innumerable

ages that must have elapsed since the deposition of the chalk in which it was en-
shrined, is a fact not less remarkable than the occurrence of the carcase of the Lena
Mammoth, in the frozen soil of Siberia.
| In another example (fig. 7), a series of sacs, held together by the connecting tube,
is uncoiled as it were, and extended in a longitudinal direction ; proving the flexible
nature of the original substance.
On examining by reflected light, under the microscope, some pieces of chalk col-
lected from the stratum which yielded the fossils above-described, minute particles of
a brown colour may be obseryed scattered over the surface ; these I have no doubt
= are remains of the integuments of foraminifera ; for in one instance, three cells of the
'S S$hell of a Rotalia lined with a similar snbstance, were exposed. Muntilated Rotalize,
2 consisting of only four or five sacs (figs. 2, 3), and 8ometimes of but one (fig. 4), are
S common both in chalk and flint; and these invariably have a torn and collapsed
S appearance.
