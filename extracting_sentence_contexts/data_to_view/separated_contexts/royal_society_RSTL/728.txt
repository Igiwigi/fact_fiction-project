HatcneTr on an artificial tanning Substance. It therefore appeared to me, that the first or dark brown -
Solution had been formed by the action of the nitric acid on
the wncombined carbonaceous part of the bitumens, or that by
which they are rendered black, and that the deep yellow
portion which was separated, was that which constituted 'the
real or essential part of these bituminous substances. This
opinion was confirmed by some experiments which I purposely
made upon amber, and having every reason therefore to
believe, that the dark brown solution obtained from asphaltum
and jet was in fact a solution of coal, T repeated the experi-
ments on several varieties of the pit or mineral coal, fromall
which, I obtained the dark brown solution in great abundance;
but those coals, which contained little or no bitumen, did not
yield the deep yellow substance which has been mentioned. In each experiment 1 employed 100 grains of the coal,
which I digested in an open matrass with one ounce of nitric
acid diluted with two ounces of water. ( The specific gravity
of the acid was 1.40.)

After the vessel had been placed in a sand-bath, and as s00n
as it became warm, a considerable effervescence attended with
much nitrous gas was produced ; after about two days I com-
monly added a second and sometimes a third ounce of the acid,
and continued the digestion during five or six days, or until
the whole, or nearly the whole, was dissolved, excepting in
those cases when the deep yellow substance was formed ; for
this I constantly separated. The next experiment was made upon charcoal, which was
more readily dissolved than the preceding substances, without
leaving any residuum ; the solution was perfect, and the colour
was reddish-brown.*
