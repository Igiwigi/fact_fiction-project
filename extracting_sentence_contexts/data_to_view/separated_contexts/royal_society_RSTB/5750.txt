When the head process had appeared at the time of operation, this is always stated,

considerably more developed than in cold,

in the entire specimen they are seen to be spread out in the form of a V.

If the cut is still further posterior, e.g., as far back as the middle of the primitive
streak, there is usually little or no trace of embryonic structure in the posterior half.
