in the first or the second position ; and the bright band, though much enfeebled, was
still plainly visible through a considerable thickness of the fluid, although a stratum
having a thickness of only a very small fraction of an inch was sufficient to absorb
the rays by which the band was produced. Although the dispersion continued
throughout the whole of the visible spectrum and beyond, it was comparatively feeble
in the brightest part of the spectrum. It became pretty copious again in the neigh-
bourhood of the dark band No. 4, and remained copious throughout the blue and
violet. In the green, the dispersed light was red, slightly verging towards orange,
and in the blue and violet it was red verging a little towards brown.

58. It may seem $uperfluous, after what precedes, to bring forward any further
proof of the reality of a change of refrangibility. Nevertheless the following experi-
ment, which was in fact performed at an early stage of these researches, may not be
deemed wholly unworthy of notice, as not involving the use either of absorbing
media or of false dispersion.

A 8mall narrow triangle of white paper was stuck on to the outside of the vessel
containing the leaf-green, in such a manner that its axis was vertical, and its vertex,
which was uppermost, was situated at the height of the middle of the spectrum. A
narrow vertical slit was then placed at the distance of the image of the first slit,
where the fixed lines were formed, and moved sideways till the light immediately
beside the fixed line G passed through it. The vessel was then placed a few inches
behind the lit, and moved sideways fill the riband-shaped beam of homogeneous
light, which passed through the second slit, was incident on the vertex of the
triangle. On Jooking at the vessel from the front, as nearly as was convenient
