The African Livestock Futures project is a good, practi-
cally focused example of this trend, which aims to provide
policy recommendations based on projected future changes
across systems and scales [10]. While intellectually fruitful, in many cases the implicit
assumption is that better research leads to more actionable
knowledge. This is, in many cases, a highly questionable con-
clusion that lies at the heart of the current translational
research crisis in academia, think tanks and government: the
fact that much scholarly research lacks clear utilitarian value
and/or languishes due to weak institutional and organizational
pathways to application [24,25]. There is a major disconnect

between how the research community generates knowledge,
and the types of information channels non-academic audiences
need, or can put into practice. The mechanisms to translate
knowledge into process are frequently weak and overlooked.
