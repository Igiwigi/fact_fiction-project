are making significant strides in developing robots that can form strong
social bonds with humans, thus enabling them to provide long-term support
and possibly even companionship to people as a result [1,2]. This interest in
developing artificial agents to serve as social companions or assistants has
inspired a growing number of studies to examine the extent to which, and
under which circumstances, we might engage with ‘social’ robots as we
would with another person or pet [3,4]. One promising avenue for examining
social engagement with another agent is to measure if and how we empathize
with that agent when we observe it in apparent pain. Empathy, the observer's
