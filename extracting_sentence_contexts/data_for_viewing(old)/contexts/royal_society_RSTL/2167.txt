the divided nerves which are connected with the brain ; for
all the muscular nerves receive more or less minute filaments
of sensitive nerves, and these we can trace into them by the
knife, and consequently, they will indicate a certain degree of
sensibility when hurt. To expose these nerves near their
origins, and before any filament of a sensitive nerve mingles
with them, requires the operator to cut deep, to break up the
bones, and to divide the blood-vessels. All such experiments
are much better omitted ; they never can lead to satisfactory
conclusions.

Experience on the human subject most abundantly illus-
trates these facts. For example :â€”a patient of mine having,
by a tumour pressing the nerves of the orbit, lost the sensi-
bility of the eye and eye-lids, she retained the motion of the
eye-lids by the portio dura coming round externally and
escaping the pressure which injured the other nerves. Here
the course of sensibility backwards to the brain was cut off,
while the course of volition was free; she could not tell
whether the eye-lid was open or shut, but being asked to
shut the eye which was already closed, she acted with the
orbicular muscle and puckered the eye-lids. When I touched
the eye there was no winking, because the sensitive fifth pair
had lost its power, although she could command the motion
by voluntary exertion.
