explosion of gunpowder, are the result, of a disburbance produced on the surface of the
ground, whereas in actual earthquake motion it is quite possible that the disturbances
we feel may have an origin which is deeply seated beneath the 8uperficial crust. The
only advantage which we can claim for our method of producing vibrations, as com-

pared with the production of them by the ignition of some explosive material, is that
we are able to make a more definite estimate of the force of the blow.

In giving the following regults, which have been classified, 80 far as it was convenient,
according to their object, we call attention to the fact that the fall of the ball was,
when we could obtain observers and instruments, used to determine several distinet
results.

Thus a blow which was used to measure the velocity along the line A B was used to
determine the relative amount of vibration transmitted along various other lines.
This remark explains why the same fall of the ball is referred to in different groups of

XZ experiments. These experiments were first projected in November, 1880. During
a the month of December instraments, &c., were being prepared and the necessary
S arrangements entered into for the carrying of them out. Of days actually spent in
= making experiments there were nine. As in s80me cases, after a set of experiments,
