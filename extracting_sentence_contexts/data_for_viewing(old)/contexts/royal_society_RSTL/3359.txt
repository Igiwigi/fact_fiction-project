taining sulphuretted hydrogen, speedily covered with suJphuret of silyer. The first
action of the gas is the revival of very white silyer, over which a brown shade is
quickly diffused, which passes into a lead colour if the paper is mois, or becomes va-
riegated if it is wet. These papers are equal in most respects to those prepared with
the phosphuretted combination.

22. If a current of sulphuretted hydrogen be thrown wpon a paper still wet with
Solution of nitrate of silver, beautiful coloured rings are produced. When the gas is
fully saturated with sulphur, these rings are very dark, and of the richest lustre, If
in this state they are placed between the leaves of a printed volume, a perfect copy of
the printing is made in twenty-four hours, the letters being white. By passing the
paper through an alcoholic solution of iodine the letters become a full black. The
singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction in this placeÂ®.

* On several occasions, when papers variously prepared (but not darkened) and marked and numbered with
Pencil at the back have been laid together, face to back, in the dark for some time, the pencil marks on some
of them have been found exactly copied (in reyerse) in a dark brown impression on their neighbours. This

23. By plunging a paper washed with the solution of the nitrate of silver into a
very diluted yolume of sulphuretted hydrogen, and transferring it from thence into
pure gas, a tolerably perfect surface is generally obtained.
