heemal canals.”

These hemophoric vessels are apparently the first part of the lymphatic system to
appear, and after thus acting as blood carriers, temporarily lose their connection with
the veins, to resume it secondarily after taking up lymph vessels developed
independently in the surrounding mesenchyme.

This heemophoric phase passed through by the lymphatic vessels in the earliest
stages of their development, when their constituent vessels are indistinguishable from
blood-vessel rudiments except by reference to their subsequent history, seems to me
to afford a most important indication of the original identity of the two systems;
when to this is added the similarity in the mode of development of the lymph and
blood vessels in the embryo, and also the facts shown by a comparative study of
their anatomy in the adult, there seems reason to suppose that the lymphatic system
(whether we adopt the Sasin or McCuure interpretation of its ontogeny) at the
inception of its phylogenetic evolution formed an integral part of the blood-vascular
system.

Whether the further assumption that this modified part of the blood-vascular system
before the onset of its specialisation for a lymph-carrying function comprised both
arteries and veins is a justifiable one is a problem of greater difficulty. If Sapm’s
interpretation of the facts of the early ontogeny are correct and the evolving
lymphatics were direct outgrowths from veins already in existence, there seems to be
no special reason to suppose that such outgrowths designed from the first for a
centripetal circulation only, should carry with them in their growth towards the
