Determining alignment has a number
of subtleties stemming from the fact that execution may proceed differently on different
devices, and that any given function may be called multiple times. As a consequence, two
neighbouring devices may each evaluate a single nbr statement in the code many times,
with some of these evaluations aligning and sharing information, while others do not
align and remain isolated. Alignment is thus the local implementation of the aggregate
notion of a field’s domain, and the key to ensuring a provable relationship between

“In fact, it is sufficient to track only the values supplied to nbr operations and the context of those operations.


aggregate specification and local implementation. The minimal syntax of field calculus
has allowed its semantics, including alignment, to be proven correct and consistent [19].
— Self-stabilization. What kind of behavioural properties can we analyse given an arbitrary
field calculus program?
