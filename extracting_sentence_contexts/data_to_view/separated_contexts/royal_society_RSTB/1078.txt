But we have seen that the effect of removal of the cerebellar influence
cerebral cortex is to cause increased rather than diminished excitability of
ee so that we are justified in assuming that the motor influence exerted
les, by the cerebellum, is a direct one through the spinal centres, rather
acting indirectly through the opposite cerebral cortex.

to the views of previous observers, I look on the ocular deviations which
destructive lesion of the cerebellum as paralytic, and not irritative pheno-
at is, the removal of the cerebellar influence from some of the ocular
ows of the production of abnormal deviations of the globes being brought
2 the unantagonized muscles. Enystagmus, I think two kinds must be distinguished ; one which is spon-
nd due to some uncontrolled action, and the other which is only evoked on
of the globes in any direction, and which is attributable to weakness
ar muscles rather than to any over-action of them.
gidity and exalted condition of the tendon reflexes on the side of the lesion
t to a direct influence of the cerebellum on the spinal centres, as has been
aformer paper.t TI regard this influence as one of control, which, when taken
he centres in the spinal cord, allows of their over-action. The facts appear
this view, and there is, I venture to think, no necessity to call to our aid Â°
