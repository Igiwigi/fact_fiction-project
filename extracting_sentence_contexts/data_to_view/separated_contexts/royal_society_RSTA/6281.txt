By drawing attention to her own name badge, A is putting it into common knowledge : =
between A and B that she has already registered, and hence, by implication, that she knows where : =
the registration desk is. It is assumed to be common knowledge between A and B, too, that the : Pa
location of the registration desk is not known to B (after all, the room is crowded). Indeed, were the : =
room empty, the same gesture would have a rather different interpretation: instead of helpfully 28
informing B where the registration desk is (an interpretation that would be blocked by the fact that : 3S
it would be common knowledge that A knows this already because it is in plain sight), it would :3
be more likely to be interpreted as a somewhat officious instruction that A should go straight to : S
the desk and get registered. By smiling back, and pointing, B is acknowledging that the message a
is received, and its content understood, before acting on it (by battling through the crowd in the Ss

appropriate direction). These interpretations only make sense, of course, in the light of a great deal
of shared background knowledge between A and B: that conferences have registration desks, the
registration desk typically gives out badges, and much more.
