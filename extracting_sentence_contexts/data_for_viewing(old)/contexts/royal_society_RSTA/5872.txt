of Mathematical Cosmology’, by providing the titles and abstracts of the particular contributions.

The plan of this paper is as follows. We split the whole period of development from 1917 until
today into Parts A and B, and this part will cover the first two periods up to around 1960. Part
B will include the remaining time and will be published separately. In the total of 36 subsections
contained in both parts of this survey, we give brief descriptions of the emergence, development,
importance and interconnections of most major subfields of theoretical mathematical cosmology,


such as relativistic, modified gravity and dark energy, inflationary, quantum, string, M-theoretic
and brane cosmologies; we also discuss alternative domains and threads of development
such as singularities, horizons, measures, stability, genericity and topology. We focus on key
theoretical discoveries as well as fundamental ideas that were to become (or, in fact, may become)
instrumental in the development of the whole field. This is presented in four key time periods
ranging from 1917 to today. In this perspective, at the end of each part of this paper, we comment
on the contents of individual invited contributions to the theme issue ‘The Future of Mathematical
Cosmology’ that are included in two separate volumes of the Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society A.

2. First period, 1917-1960

In the first period of developments of mathematical cosmology, there appeared a great number
of novel fundamental ideas that still play a major role today in shaping the field of theoretical
