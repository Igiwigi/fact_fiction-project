doubtless, connected with assimilation. Some plants, eg., Hibiscus, do not form
intumescences in darkness, while others, e.g., Populus tremula, do so with some
readiness. Probably this depends partly upon the presence or absence of the

products of assimilation in the leaf at the time of experiment. It might be tested
by trying whether an aspen leaf which has been emptied of its carbohydrates would
form intumescences in darkness. Some light is thrown on the question by the fact
that intumescences will form on leaves floating on a solution of sugar under
conditions in which they are not produced in leaves floating on water or on Knop's
solution. Under the conditions favourable to the formation of intumescences
assimilation is gradually checked by the lack of salts due to the stoppage of
the transpiration current owing to the damp air. In darkness carbon dioxide
assimilation is stopped at once, so that only pre-existing carbohydrates are
available.

In this connection it is instructive to note that some stem intumescences and all
wound-callus form more rapidly and extensively in darkness than in light. But
in the case, e.g., of callus, the starch stored in the stem is used up in the formation
of new tissue, as this gradually disappears towards the neighbourhood of the callus.
