that Jeffreys’s differential equation (22) is strictly limited in its application to only those
situations which are in marginal stability. No such limitation restricts the application of
equations (126) to (134) since no considerations of stability are involved in setting the time
derivates of the scalars equal to zero.

7. THE REDUCTION OF THE EQUATIONS OF STATIONARY TURBULENCE

In this section we shall derive by successive elimination a single differential equation of
the sixth order governing A. We shall also obtain some general integrals of the equations
(126) to (134).

First, we may observe that according to equations (134) both Z and P should vanish
identically. This follows from the fact that L satisfies Laplace’s equation (in five dimensions) ;
it must therefore vanish if it is bounded everywhere and tends to zero at infinity; P then
satisfies Laplace’s equation and by the same arguments it must also vanish identically. Thus

L=P=0; (135)
therefore, in stationary turbulence (cf. table 1)

Ou; =0'u, and oui =—o'u, (136)

and A,=6u; and Il, = ow. (137)

Now apply the operator A; to equation (127 Ae and make use of equations (128) and (129).
We obtain (k-+v) AZA = |] A,Q,—
