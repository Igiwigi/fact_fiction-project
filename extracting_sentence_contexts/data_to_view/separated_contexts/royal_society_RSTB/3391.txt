212 MISS M. G. SYKES ON THE ANATOMY AND MORPHOLOGY OF THE

a reduction from the four bundles supplying the cotyledon in the Cycads, ete.,* and
may possibly be regarded as a stage towards the reduced vascular supply of the
Angiospermous cotyledon, in which a relic of the paired bundles is still often
traceable in the peculiar V-shaped bundle recorded by various observers. t

The double vascular supply of the “ flowers” in Welwitschia is closely paralleled
among the Cycads,{ where the two bundles supplying the ovules often have a
separate origin from two adjoining bundles of the axis; the arrangement in
Welwitschia is, however, rendered still more complex by the fact that each of the two
bundles here supplying the flower has itself a double origin. But the main course of
the bundles in the cone-axis of the Cyeads and Welwitschia is essentially similar ; to
take a concrete example, Dioon edule may be closely compared with Welwitschia. The axis of the cone of Dioon§ has several ares of bundles together forming a
regular whorl and the two ends of each are provide the bundles supplying the ovules.
