Case 1 is normal, Case 4 which showed a relatively slight degree of
dementia approaches most nearly to the normal. Cases 5 and 6 of infants aged
respectively three months and one month come next in order, and Cases 3 and 4
of pronounced chronic insanity with dementia, occupy the last place on the list. This is a point of considerable importance in view of the facts that the 4th and 5th
layers show no constant variation, and that layer 3 as a whole is of the same thick-
ness respectively in the three patients with normal vision, and in the three cases of
blindness. In Table IV. (fig. 52), a similar relation is seen in the respective depth of
the conjoined 1st and 2nd layers of the cortex in the different cases. Here, however,
in the infants, and especially in the younger of the two, this layer is much thinner
than in the cases of pronounced chronic insanity, on the other hand, in the first four
cases on the list, the same relation exists as that shown in Table III. (fig. 51).
