W. WARDLAW ON THE SHOOT APEX OF DRYOPTERIS

a certain amount of growth had taken place cannot be decided on the evidence available. In the isolated terminal region there was no evidence of greater growth on the non-incised
side, where the vascular tissue had not been severed. There was, in fact, a slight tangential
enlargement on the incised side (figure 15), this being probably due to the absence of
compression from adjacent tissues. Ficures 13 to 15. Transverse sections of a shoot in which the apical meristem had been three-quarters
ringed.
