the colour gauge group SU(3). If we consider just the pure gauge interactions associated with the : Ss
SU(3)-vector bosons, the gluons, the classical theory is invariant under scaling transformations. DN
Namely, if A, represents the gluon fields, and A, is a classical solution to the equations of : =
motion, then so is the scaled configuration: 1A(Ax), for any real parameter 4. Again, the quantum : &

structure of the vacuum of QCD breaks this symmetry. One starts with a scale invariant theory,
but quantum mechanics generates a scale, known as Agcp ~ 200 MeV.

The proton and neutrons are each made of three quarks (uud for the proton, udd for the
neutron). The mass parameters for the u,d quarks that appear in the SM as a consequence of
the BEH mechanism are very small (in the few MeV range) compared with the masses of protons
and neutrons, which are about 1000 MeV. Hence, the sum of two up and one down quark mass
parameters hardly account for the mass of the proton. The largest contribution come, in fact,
from the fact that the quarks and gluons are highly relativistic objects confined in a space of the
other of a fermi. A purely quantum phenomenon owing to QCD: the confinement of colour. As
mentioned before, a new scale is generated dynamically in this case. Even if the mass paraemters
of the up and down quarks were set to zero, we would still have protons and neutrons with
masses approximately equal to those we observe. Incidentally, what makes the study of the strong
interactions hard is the fact that

Agcpd > Mu, Mq-

A large fraction of the mass of protons and neutrons has its origin in this quantum phenomenon
of confinement.
