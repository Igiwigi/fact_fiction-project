the polypite begins to retract by rhythmical twitches, the rate of this rhythm rapidly
increasing until it ends in tonic contraction. When the polypite has just become fully
retracted—or very often a little earlier—the bell suddenly begins its forcible and well-
pronounced rhythmic contractions, which rapidly increase in their rate of rhythm, until
they coalesce into a vigorous and persistent spasm. If the animal be now restored
to normal sea-water, spontaneity will return in a feeble manner ; but there is always
afterwards a great tendency displayed by the bell to exhibit shivering spasms instead
of normal swimming movements in response to natural or ganglionic stimulation.
And, as already observed, this peculiarity of the excitable tissues is also well marked
in the case of the artificial stimulation of deganglionated specimens under otherwise
gimilar ciremmnstances.

The only facts which still remain to be considered regarding these shivering move-
ments of paralyzed Sars:a are those which have reference to electrical stimulation.
It will be remembered that in my firs} paper (loc. cit.) I described these shivering
movements as ensuing, not only when the paralyzed bells are immersed in chemical
stimulants, but alsv when they are immersed in normal sea-water immediately after
having been submitted to electrical stimulation. As the passage in my former
paper which describes this effect of electrical stimulation is a short one, I will here
transeribe it :—

* When the swimming-bell of Sarsia has had its margin removed, and 80, as proved
by hundreds of similar experiments, has been entirely deprived of its locomotor centres,
nevertheless, in response to electrical stimulation, instead of giving a single contraction
to make or break, it may begin a highly peculiar motion of a flurried, shivering
