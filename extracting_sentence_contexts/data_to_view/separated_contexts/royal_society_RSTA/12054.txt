By this method he found that the rate of
propagation of the ignition of hydrogen and oxygen was 34 metres per second, while
the rate of ignition of carbonic oxide and oxygen was less than 1 metre per second. BuNSsEN applied these results to the rate of explosion of gases in closed vessels: his
results were accepted without cavil for four and twenty years. By 1880 facts began to accumulate which seemed inconsistent with BunseEnâ€™s
conclusions. For instance, between 1876-80 I had several times observed that the
flame produced by igniting a mixture of moist carbonic oxide and oxygen travelled in
a long eudiometer too quickly to be followed by the eye. Again, Mr.
