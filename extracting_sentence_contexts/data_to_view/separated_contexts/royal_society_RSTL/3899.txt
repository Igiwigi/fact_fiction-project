Bowman, Esq., F.R.S. Received July 23,â€”Read November 20, 1845. THE term Hrduced contractions was applied in England to a physiological fact
discovered by myself, and described in the tenth chapter of my treatise on the Elec-
tro-physiological Phenomena of Animals. I shall henceforth adopt this denomination,
since it has the advantage of expressing the phenomenon with brevity, and, to a certain
degree, its nature. I will begin by explaining, in a few words, in what this fact consists, together with
the principal researches which I made in the commencement for the purpose of dis-
covering its laws.
