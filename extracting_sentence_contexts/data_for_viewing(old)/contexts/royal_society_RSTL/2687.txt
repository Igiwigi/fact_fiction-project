of thermal action is close to the Graus d'Olette, a winding part of the road, rendered
necessary by the narrowness of the ravine which the torrent penetrates. There can
hardly be a doubt that this is a line of fissure ; and it is precisely at this fissure that
the springs rise most abundantly. It may also be observed, that the hot springs here
take their rise remarkably from the precipitous banks of tributary torrents whose
beds have perhaps formed subordinate fissures. 2. Almost at the same point is the
copper mine of Canavielles- in. granite. Hence, as at St. Sauyeur, we have the co-
ordinate (and I think connected) phenomena of intrusive rocks, dislocations or
fissures, metalliferous impregnation, and hot springs.

B. Specialties of the Springs. —Nothing can give a fitter idea of the necessity of
the precautions we have adopted for identifying the springs described in this paper,
and also of the number and importance of those of Roussillon, than the fact, that
with the minute and faithful work of AncLapa before me, I have had great difficulty
in ascertaining whether or not the springs which I observed occur amongst those
mentioned by him at Thuez. - Indeed, considering their wild and almost inaccessible
position, the little interest taken by the people in them, and the impossibility of
making myself understood where nothing is spoken but the Catalonian dialect, I had
rather cause of congratulation that I should have discovered any of them. Even the
* z&le hydrologique” of AxcLapa was almost exhausted on the banks of the Tet,
where, he observes, *il nrest surtout arriv6 lexecuter des analyses, suspendu, pour
ainsi dire, sur des abimes.” A complete examination of springs s0 abundant and 80
varied, (partaking of the medicinal characters of the waters of Bardges, Plombidres,
and Bagndres,) which are, besides, the hottest in the Pyrenees, could not fail to be
of the highest interest in a general as well as a scientific point of view, I was
