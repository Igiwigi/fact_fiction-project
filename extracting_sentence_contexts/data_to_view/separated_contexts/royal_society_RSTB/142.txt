35. The presence of the factor v in this result is accounted for by the fact that the
solution has been really that of the more general question : “to find the locus of the
Cores-points of all chords of (relatively to their intersections with L) which
touch s”; discarding, therefore, this factor, the equation of the tangents to w at the

L by applying it to the canonical form of u, for which Caytey has obtained the form

referred to in § 6.
