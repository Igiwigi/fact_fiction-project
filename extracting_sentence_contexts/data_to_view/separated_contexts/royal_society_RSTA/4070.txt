As shown in figure 11, failure initiation occurs in overloaded areas of the
matrix (figures 9 and 10). Furthermore, the failure modes of composites [8] are in accordance with
failure mechanisms on model composite [8]. Owing to the fact that the basic principles of the analytical approach are independent of
mechanical properties for different materials (figures 7 and 8), the findings from this study should
also be transferable to all fibre-reinforced materials.

5. Conclusion

For this work, a hierarchical approach was chosen to investigate the degradation process in
composites containing void inclusions under compressive load. By using an analytical approach
it could be shown that the mechanical behaviour of fibre-reinforced composites is significantly
influenced by the stiffness of both matrix and fibre and the fibre-matrix bonding, further by the
initial fibre orientation and the fibre diameter.
