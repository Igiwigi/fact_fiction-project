I have also arrived at
similar results #, and find, as stated by him, that heat in any way excited in metallic
conductors, whilst transmitting an electrical current, tends to impair their conducting
power. Mr. Carisw1E, likewise, has observed the same fact, as appears in his last in-
teresting paper on the Laws of Magneto-electric Induction .

ductors are numerous and very conclusive, yet opposite views have been adyanced by
Dr. Rrrcnrs in his paper on Electric Conduction ||.
