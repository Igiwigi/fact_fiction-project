The study [24,25] indicated that the effect of electrical grid faults may propagate through the
mechanical subsystem of the turbine and cause major structural vibrations. The application of :
custom power devices to counteract the effect of grid fault-induced vibration is considered in :=

the study. Numerical results show that flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) Sy
devices and unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) in particular are successful in mitigating a
vibrations due to electrical faults, and they can be conveniently applied to stabilize the generator aed
shaft speed, drive train oscillations, edgewise blade vibrations and tower responses. : _

Offshore wind energy has gained increasing attention owing to increased electricity generation : Ss
of offshore power plants with respect to their onshore counterparts and also other advantages : s
such as reduced visual impacts, less turbulence and lower noise constraints. For floating offshore : s
wind turbines, it has been proposed to modify the blade pitch angle and the generator torque to : Ss

improve the damping of problematic motions and loads on floating platforms [26-28]. Recently,
passive control of floating wind turbine nacelle and spar vibrations using multiple TMDs has
been investigated by Dinh & Basu [29].
