are larger than the emission peak by which the resolution can only be estimated by measuring the spacing between two spectral
emission peaks like in case #2. (Online version in colour.)

By using a calibration lamp to measure the resolution of a sensor, three different cases can
arise depending on the relation of the emission peak width and the pixel size of the sensor. In
the first case, the width of the calibration lamp’s emission peak is larger than a single pixel. In
that case, the resolution can be measured by dividing the peak’s spectral width by the number of
pixels used to image the peak. The second case is when the emission peak is the same width as a
pixel. In that case, the resolution is measured by measuring the spacing between two calibration
peaks and dividing the spectral value by the number of pixels. The third and final case is when
the calibration peak is thinner than a pixel. In that case, similarly as for the second case, the
spacing between two calibration peaks is measured and divided by the number of pixels but the
uncertainty is increased by the fact that the sensor cannot differentiate between two emission
peaks that would be on the same pixel.

Using the Hg—Ar calibration lamp, the resulting image and spectrum taken with the prototype
are shown in figure 7. From the spectrum extracted, four different peaks can be identified, two
single emission peaks and one doublet. By comparing the peaks identified to the calibration
lamp’s emission spectrum, they can be identified as being the 579nm and 576.9nm doublet, the
546.1 nm peak and the 435.8 nm peak. Since the prototype is able to differentiate the two emission
