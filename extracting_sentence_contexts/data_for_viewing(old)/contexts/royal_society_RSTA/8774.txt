occurred in the Hydrogen spectrum under these circumstances from the members of
lower to those of higher term number, and that, in the quantitative sense, this transfer,
which could be measured very accurately, was considerable. We now consider the
other side of the problem of inter-action of two gases, from the point of view of the
heavier gas. The series arrangement in Neon being unknown, this could not be
discussed previously, but the present data for Helium give a basis for discussion.

Passing now to the Diffuse series of Helium, as shown on photographs (b) and (ce),
and in Table XIIL., the effect of a small quantity of Hydrogen is very marked. On
a scale which preserves \5876 with intensity 10 in each case, the intensity of \4471
is 19°5 in pure Helium, but only 11°2, or only half as great, when a trace of Hydrogen
is inserted. Moreover, \4026 falls in intensity from 8°69 to 1°63—or less than half.
In fact, it falls even relatively to \4471, so that the result implies a definite energy
transfer of considerable amount towards the members of low term number in the
series, and more especially towards \5876. ‘This is precisely the converse phenomenon
to that found in Hydrogen itself when mixed with a large quantity of Neon or
Helium.

The Sharp series of Helium behaves in the same manner, and to an extent which
is nearly equivalent, in the quantitative sense. While \4713 is retained at 10, the
higher member—of lower term number—a7065 is enhanced from 0°58 to 0°73, in the
proportion 3°2. At the same time 4121 falls from 2°4 to 2°1—a change quite outside
the possible limits of experimental error in this mode of measurement. We may
therefore state, in general terms, that the effect of a trace of Hydrogen is to throw
the energy in the two series much more completely into members of lower term
