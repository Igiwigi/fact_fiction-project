hardens tool steel by preventing the separation of “ ferrite,” or iron containing no
carbon.

Tn a single crystal the molecules are presumably in an equilibrium configuration of
maximum stability. In this event, the equilibrium of molecules at or near inter-
crystalline boundaries, in a body composed of a large number of crystals, must, in
general, be less stable than that of the molecules in the interior of the crystals. In
fact, where the orientation of the component crystals is haphazard, the stability of
the boundary molecules may be expected to range from the maximum of normal
crystallisation down to zero, %.¢., neutral equilibrium. If such a body be subjected
to a shear stress, some of the molecules in or near neutral equilibrium must, in general,
become unstable, and these will tend to rotate to new positions of equilibrium. This
rotation, however, will be strongly resisted, as has been seen, by forces doubtless of
a viscous nature, and its amount will accordingly depend on the time during which
the stress is applied. If, therefore, the strain is observed it will be found to increase
slowly as time goes on, but at a constantly decreasing rate, as the molecules concerned
approach equilibrium. If now the load is removed, these molecules must rotate in
order to regain their original positions of equilibrium, and this process in turn will be
retarded by viscous forces. Hence a small part of the observed strain will remain
after the removal of the load, and this will gradually disappear as time goes on. These
