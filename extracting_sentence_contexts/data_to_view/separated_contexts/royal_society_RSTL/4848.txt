But, when the
circumstances are considered, it seems to admit of quite as easy an interpretation. The bathing of the ova freely with seminal fluid mixed with water, five seconds after
the application of the solution of potass, diluted this solution too much to allow of
its effect on the whole of the spermatozoa applied to the ova, while this very dilution
enabled the impregnating influence of thtese bodies to take effect in some of the ova. The fact, however, leads to an inference of some importance with reference to the
action of the potass on the envelopes of the ovum, and seems to show that this
action is less immediate on the enyelopes than on the spermatozoa. No. 5. Fifty-nine ova were bathed with seminal fluid and water, and five seconds
afterwards with a solution of nitrate of potass (in the proportion of twenty grains of
the salt to one ounce of water), and water was then added to them.
