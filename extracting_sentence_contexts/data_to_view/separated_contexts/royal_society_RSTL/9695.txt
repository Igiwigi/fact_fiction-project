It commences at as low an exhaustion as 14 millims., but does not increase to any
great extent till an exhaustion of 200 M is attained ; it then rises rapidly to a maxi-
mum at between 40 and 60 M, after which it falls away to zero. The maximum
repulsion exerted by radiation in hydrogen is to that in air as 70 to 42'6. This fact
is now utilised in the construction of radiometers and similar instruments when great
sensitiveness Is required,

692. Taking the viscosity of air at 760 millims, as 0'1124, and hydrogen as 0-0499,
the proportion between them is 04439, GRAHAM* gives the transpiration time for
hydrogen as 0'4375 taking oxygen as unity, or 0'4855 taking air as unity (706). 693.
