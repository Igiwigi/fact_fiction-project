The preceding facts explain satisfactorily that the cerebrum is
made up of thin convolutions of medullary and cortical sub-
stance surrounding the two lateral ventricles ; which are un-
folded when the cavities of those ventricles are enlarged, and
in this unfolded tate the functions belonging to this part of
the organ can be carried on. Although the quantity of water may be so much increased
without material injury to the functions of the brain when the
skull is not ossified, yet after that period even a few ounces
in the lateral ventricles has been known to produce so much
undue pressure, as to bring on head-ache, general uneasiness,
a sensation as if the head were too large, loss of spirits, con-
vulsions, loss of memory of recent events, idiotism, insensibi-
lity, and death.*
