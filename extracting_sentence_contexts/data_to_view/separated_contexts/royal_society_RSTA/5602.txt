So does the item [Prinz J. The adoption of Gaussian greatest integer function here is also due
to the fact that we need to ensure the output number of each type of alters is also an integer. Then
we introduce constraints. Subject to: constraints of integer decision variables, of limited resources settings, of upper or
lower bound of kits’ number for each index can distribute, and of location consideration

To be specific, constraints (3.6) are the motivation of our study, that is, to consider a limited
resource situation of HIVST secondary distribution kits’ optimal allocation for indexes.
