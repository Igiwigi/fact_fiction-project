task for whose complete fulfillment Hilbert set no clear criteria. Thus, Hilbert’s detailed account in
the opening remarks of his talk as to what a meaningful problem in mathematics is, and his stress
on the fact that a solution to a problem should be attained in a finite number of steps, does not
apply in any sense to the sixth one. On the contrary, the sixth problem has important connections
with three other problems on Hilbert’s list: the nineteenth (Are all the solutions of the Lagrangian
equations that arise in the context of certain typical variational problems necessarily analytic?),
the twentieth (dealing with the existence of solutions to partial differential equations with given
boundary conditions), closely related to the nineteenth and at the same time to Hilbert’s long-
standing interest on the Dirichlet Principle, and, finally, the twenty-third (an appeal to extend
and refine the existing methods of variational calculus). Like the sixth problem, the latter two
are general tasks rather than specific mathematical problems with a clearly identifiable, possible
solution. All these three problems are also strongly connected to physics, though unlike the sixth,
they are also part of mainstream, traditional research concerns in mathematics. In fact, their
connections to Hilbert’s own interests are much more perspicuous and, in this respect, they do not
raise the same kind of historical questions that Hilbert’s interest in the axiomatization of physics
does.


A balanced assessment of the influence of the problems on the development of mathematics | |
throughout the century must take into account not only the intrinsic importance of the problems

but also the privileged institutional role of Gottingen in the mathematical world with the direct 3
and indirect implications of its special status. However, if Hilbert wished to influence the course of :8
mathematics over the coming century with his list, then it is remarkable that his own career was ig
only very partially shaped by it. Part of the topics covered by the list belonged to his previous : a
