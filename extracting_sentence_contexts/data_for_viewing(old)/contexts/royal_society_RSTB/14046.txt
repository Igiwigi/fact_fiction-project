with sociality [80-82]. ‘Cognitive control’, the ability to choose
the best of competing responses accurately [83] or to delay
reward for increasing lengths of time [84] correlate similarly.
Finally, the endothermic branches of the terrestrial vertebrate
invasion, birds and mammals, show a 10-fold increase in rela-
tive brain size, called a ‘grade shift’, which is one of the most
distinct in vertebrate history. What is this as-yet undefined
brain mass? Neurons, glia or connections? All of the brain, or
parts (and which parts?), more generalized ‘computing
power’, memory, or specific classes of circuitry? The water-
to-land transition generates an unusually well-defined list of
behavioural necessities that allow some reinterpretations of
the basic facts known about how brains change.

(ii) Mass and neuron number

Overall mass, a crude measure indeed for any computing
device, has successfully resisted more decomposition than
would seem probable. Substitution of neuron number for
mass, whether done by exhaustive stereological techniques
or flow cytometry [85-88], produces generally similar rank-
ings, and shows that between-taxon density differences are
pervasive. Neuron number is usually thought to be the germ-
inal element of change in brain volume, but in specific cases,
alteration in the amount of connectivity can be the direct
