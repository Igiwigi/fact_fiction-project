5. If we burnish half of a leaf, and tarnish a portion of both the dull and bright
parts, the iodine will then attack, first, the tarnished, then the bright, and last of all
the unpolished portion.

6. Spreading a leaf of silver upon a piece of copper foil, and, to render the adhesion
perfect, applying a gentle heat, a surface was formed which received the iodine
readily. A sheet thus prepared was perfectly iodidated in five minutes, whereas a
surface of the same extent on glass required twelve minutes.

These results established in my mind most satisfactorily, the possibility of giving
to paper all the properties of the silver plates. It is clearly shown, that a degree of
oxidation is required on the metallic surface. From this fact, the necessity is 8ug-
gested of examining the peculiarities of action manifested by iodine, on the oxides of
silver produced in different ways, and their relative states of sensibility to luminous
influence induced by iodidation.

ARGENTINE COMPOUNDS, SPREAD ON PAPER, SENSITIVE TO LIGHT, ETC. 327

To prevent cireumlocution in describing the results of the inquiries into which I
was led, I would explain, that when I speak of a paper being rendered sensitive, I
always mean, that it becomes, after exposure to light, capable of receiving the mer-
