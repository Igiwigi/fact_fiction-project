ment of scurvy in guinea-pigs deprived of all vitamin C. Since then histological studies
on the effects of vitamin C deficiency upon the teeth have been made by other workers,
including HésEer and Westin (1925), Toverup (1923), Key and Expuick (1931), also
working with guinea-pigs. We felt it was desirable, however, to examine in greater
detail and with improved technique the nature of the abnormalities, including the
lesions (if any) occurring in the enamel and the cementum (hitherto these had usually
been overlooked), more especially to find the effects of long-continued slight deficiencies
of vitamin C or of frequently repeated deprivations—in order to correspond the better
with the conditions actually prevailing in human experience. The guinea-pig, of
course, differs in some important respects from man in its dental structure and physiology
(e.g., persistent growth), and the present work can only be regarded as a preliminary to
further investigations to be carried out on monkeys. In the meantime, we think it
significant that we have found that vitamin C deficiency in the guinea-pig does in fact

give rise to a failure in ameloblast function. his is the very kind of abnormality
which, when it occurs in a small group of cells in developing human teeth, gives rise to
the enamel lamellz in which caries often originates. It may reasonably be anticipated
that the same result will ensue in monkeys deprived of vitamin C during infancy.

A second and more immediate object of the investigation was in relation to enquiries in
which one of us (L. J. H.) is interested as to the mode of action of vitamin C. The highly
involved and somewhat contradictory set of abnormalities as described by past workers,
