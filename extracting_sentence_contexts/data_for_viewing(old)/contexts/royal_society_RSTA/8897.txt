parts of the British Isles . 255 :

Thus the olivine dolerites which occur in the Coal Measures have in general a
high susceptibility, averaging about 400, but in some cases they exceed that figure.
These high values are evidently due to the presence of magnetite in considerable
amounts in the rocks, The lower figures sometimes given by apparently similar
rocks are explained by the fact that in such rocks the iron-ore is in the form of
ilmenite instead of magnetite.

In the dolerites and similar basic rocks the two minerals, magnetite and ilmenite,
are frequently intergrown,t but the amount of each present in the intergrowth varies
considerably, It is this fact that causes the wide differences observed in dolerites
from different localities, and even in different specimens from the same mass, as in the
Owthorpe example. Riicker and Wurre* determined the susceptibilities of four
specimens from different parts of the Whin Sill (quartz-dolerite) as :— E

whereas the petrologically similar rock at St. Davids had susceptibility 0.
