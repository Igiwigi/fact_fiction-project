On
the one hand, the rate of driven reconnection may be modulated—or even determined—by the
properties of ‘background’ turbulence [77]. On the other hand, the dissipation of an MHD cascade
is likely to be governed by the behaviour of spontaneously formed reconnection regions on kinetic
scales (e.g. [78,79]). The situation is complicated by the fact that the Poynting flux associated with
the emergence of closed-loop regions (which presumably drive the reconnection) is seen to be
roughly 10° W m~? [69], which is of the same order of magnitude as the Alfvén wave energy flux
discussed above. Thus, it would not be surprising if the corona were heated by an inseparable
combination of wave/turbulence dissipation and magnetic reconnection.

2Reconnection is also believed to be a dominant process in driving coronal heating in the primarily closed-field corona of active
regions and the quiet Sun, but that topic is slightly beyond the scope of this review (e.g. [72-76]). Observations of coronal plumes and jets provide evidence for the existence of discrete
reconnection events in open-field regions [80,81], However, these bright and narrow features are
identifiable in images, because they appear to occupy a small fraction of the coronal volume at
any one time.
