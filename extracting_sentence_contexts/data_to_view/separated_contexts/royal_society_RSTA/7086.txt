The wetting of lead styphnate in bulk was found to be accelerated by both saponin and
perminal; the wetting of lead azide is more difficult, but accelerated wetting by aqueous
solutions was observed after adding 0-1 % perminal. Little difference was found in sensitiveness to grit friction when these surface active
solutions were used for spraying, instead of water or water + glycerin. This is probably due
to the fact that thin layers of composition are in any case very rapidly wetted. To investigate this point, the active ingredient from solid perminal was extracted with
acetone, and recovered by evaporation. Tubes of gutta-percha and of glass (0-6 and 0-3cm.
diameter respectively) were filled with 3cm. of initiator.
