In addition to the presence of these vertebre, there are other indications of segmen-
tation in the basal plate. It is characteristic of Anserine birds that the atlas rib is
well developed and persists in the adult (ar fig. 10). In front of it, in a duck of
seven days, four pairs of condensations extend for a short distance lateral and ventral
to the basal plate, the most posterior pair being associated with the hypocentrum of
the second occipital vertebra. These have every appearance of being serially homo-
logous with the cervical ribs, and they must be interpreted as vestigial cranial ribs
belonging to the vertebrae which have been absorbed
in this region, fig. 10; figs. 71-75, er. 6-9, Plate 52.
A small quantity of blue-stained intercellular sub-
stance is visible in the posterior two pairs, fig. 31,
Plate 46; the remaining ribs are much more reduced,
as would be expected from the fact that their ver-
tebree have no longer an individual existence.

With regard to the dorsal elements of the basal
plate, a study of a whole preparation of the chon-
drocranium of a seven-day duck reveals four pairs
of arches arising, each forming the posterior border
of a future ventral nerve-root foramen. The arches
soon become connected dorsally with the members
of their own side, and the foramina are thus com-
pleted. The posterior arch (0.a. 9) continues to
