Obviously, by keeping constant the injection velocity for the
whole process, the mass is expected to linearly increase with time, but the aim of this comparison
is to underline the macroscopic differences which arise during the phenomenon evolution due to
substantial discrepancies in the polymerâ€™s viscosity. By referring to table 4, one can immediately
notice how the inlet velocity for ABS is practically half of that obtained for the PS at the same
Reynolds number. This is due to the fact that the plateau viscosity for PS is about double that for
ABS, as in table 3. As reported in figure 8, the higher the Re, the shorter the injection time. As is easily predicted,
PS and ABS show different slopes as a function of the different plateau viscosity.
