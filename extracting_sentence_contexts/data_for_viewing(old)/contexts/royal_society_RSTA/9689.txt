These last arrangements are, of course, no argument in favour of the constant ratio
‘21520. They can only be regarded as suggestions of the way in which the 1—m-
term may enter if we know that the constant ratio has a real existence, and that this
modified sequence is the correct form. But in the present state of our knowledge
nothing is to be gained by attempting a closer approximation. It may, however, be
noted that the general agreement between the two arrangements A and A, is due to
the fact that except for Ba A is roughly 3A, Also as affecting the argument in
favour of the arrangement, it may be mentioned that a change of unity in the
multiples of A or A, in the most favourable direction towards the value °21520 affects
that ratio in the two cases as follows, viz. :—

For Mg . . ‘21380, ‘21626; Ca. . ‘21054, 21697; Sr. . 19588, ‘21960;

and, of course, very much larger deviations for Ba.
A glance at Table T. shows that in Al and the Ga sub-group the « is always larger
than ‘2154. In fact, the actual ratios of a/u are
