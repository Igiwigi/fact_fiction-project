It was also found that the distribution of
velocity was only independent of the values of vd/v when the surfaces of the pipes
were so roughened that the resistance varied as the square of the velocity. On examining the results of Darcy and THRELFALL no very satisfactory evidence
of a variation of the ratio with variations of vd/v was forthcoming. This may be
due to the fact that THRELFALL’s observations are all included in a range of vd/v of
from 66,000 to 300,000, and: as the variation in the ratio may be assumed to be
small, the difference between the results would not be detected very easily, and also
to the possibility that Daroy’s observations were made in a region. over which the
curve showing the variation of the ratio with vd/v was nearly horizontal. As an accurate determination of the ratio was essential for many of the proposed
friction experiments it was decided to make an extensive series of observations with
a view to tracing the variation of the ratio from its value 0°5 below the critical value
of the ratio vd/y to as high a value as possible. As the use of an accurately
calibrated gas holder was available it was possible to make the determination for the
case of air flow as well as for water flow.
