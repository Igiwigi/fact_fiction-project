and possibly electrical gradients. Migration is physically and metabolically
stressful, however, and many circulating tumour cells undergo apoptosis and
die. Surviving cells may exit the circulation and lodge at distant sites where
they may remain dormant for some time (even years) or re-proliferate to
form secondary tumours straight away. The overall process of secondary
tumour formation is known as ‘metastasis’ and this is the main cause of
death in cancer patients (figure 1).

The central role played by particular ITMs in the pathophysiology of
cancer is indicated, in the first instance, by their appearance consistently in
all cancers studied thus far. Ion transport occurs throughout the multi-stage
cancer process, from the initial transformation of a normal cell into a cancer
cell to metastasis. In fact, all ‘hallmarks’ of cancer involve or can potentially
involve ITMs [2-4]. In this overall regard, ITMs possess some remarkable
characteristics. For example, a typical membrane potential is equivalent to a
voltage gradient of some |107Vm™'|, a huge force that can impact upon
every protein in the membrane. Even red blood cells which do not have a
nucleus still have a membrane potential. Voltage-gated sodium channels
