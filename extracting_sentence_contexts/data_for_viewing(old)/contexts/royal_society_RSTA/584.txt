at least three levels and with a special structure of transition probabilities. For our further
studies, it is important to remark that this is a consequence of coincidence of Einstein’s B-
coefficients describing the transition probabilities for stimulated absorption and emission, B,2 =
Boi. This coincidence is questionable in our quantum-like social studies. The field of social
information excitations is a boson field, i.e. its quanta satisfy the Bose-Einstein statistics. However,
there are no reasons to identify its mathematical structure precisely with the electromagnetic
field (although the latter is convenient for giving the simplest model). Moreover, the standard
derivation of coincidence of Einstein’s B-coefficients (for the quantum electromagnetic field) is
based on the assumption of approaching the thermodynamical equilibrium and the probability
distribution for the field’s energy described by the Planck law for black-body radiation. Even the
approachability of such an equilibrium in social modelling can be questioned. Thus, in principle
the social analogues of lasers based on two-level systems are possible. However, we ignore these
technicalities (which are in fact very important even in the social engineering of ASE): we want
to present just the basic scheme of amplification of coherent social information excitations.

?Impurities would contribute to decoherence of the emitted beam.


That is all: we need nothing more from quantum physics. We shall now establish the
correspondence between elements of the quantum physical and the quantum-like social model.

excitations

In modern physics, the purely information interpretation of physical laws plays the important role
