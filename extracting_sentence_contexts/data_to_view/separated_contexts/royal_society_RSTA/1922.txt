* This accounts for the remarkable similarity which
undoubtedly exists between the curves of extension to time and those of optical
retardation to time, under constant load. In the earlier experiments in which these two
were observed separately, this similarity was often partly masked by the influence of
previous treatment on the specimens, and by the fact that the same specimen could
not be employed for both sets of observations without reshaping. ยง 12. Comparison with the Results of Coker and CuaKko,

Meanwhile it is of considerable interest to examine the results of Coker and CuakKo
(loc. cit.).
