14. The digestive organs arise similarly to those of Patella, but the radula retains a
more primitive character after metamorphosis.

15. The characters peculiar to Haliotis develop in the late plantigrade larva.
Hypertrophy of the columellar muscle is accompanied by displacement of the pallial
cavity to the left side and shell flattening. The ability to retract into the shell ceases,
but the operculum does not fall off for some time after its function is lost. The cleft
in the roof of the pallial fold is responsible for the formation of one shell perforation,
at the close of metamorphosis. It provides for the increased respiration made possible
by the addition of the second ctenidium.

16. The possible bearing of the ontogenetic facts upon phylogenetic theories is
discussed.
