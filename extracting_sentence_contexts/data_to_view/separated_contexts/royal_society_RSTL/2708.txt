And, on
the other hand, as light appears to be a specific stimulus to the vital functions of
animals, 80 it may be imagined to act in a similar manner on those of plants, thus
enabling them to secrete from the carbonic acid presented to them the carbon re-
quired for their nutrition. Another point as yet undecided relates to the extent of the influence it exerts
over the vegetable kingdom ; or, in other words, the degree in which certain pro-
cesses attributed to its presence are capable of counteracting others that are going
on at all times, whether light be absent or not. Thus, although it may be conceded,
as a fact already well established, that plants purify the air in the sunshine, it still
remained to be proved by more decided experiments than had hitherto been insti-
tuted, whether the quantity of oxygen given out by them during the day exceeded
that absorbed during the night; and moreover, supposing this latter question an-
swered in the affirmative, whether the probable excess was likely to be such, as would

the like*,

After considering therefore the mode in which light appears to affect the functions
of plants, I shall naturally proceed to examine the ex/ent of the changes produced by
the latter upon the air through its influence. Parr I.—On the Influence of Light upon Plants.
