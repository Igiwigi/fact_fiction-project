age prediction models developed using human transcriptomes
could accurately predict chronological ages in macaques. To test
this, we used a transcriptomic age prediction approach devel-
oped in humans [58] to predict chronological ages from our
normalized macaque gene expression data. We included
genes that passed an FDR of 20% in both analyses. Following
previous studies [58], predictions were agnostic to sex as sex
differences in perpheral blood transcriptomic ageing tend to
be relatively minor. After scaling the predictions to the age
distribution in our sample population, we found a strong cor-
relation between known chronological ages and cross-species
transcriptomic age predictions (figure 3), with a Pearson’s r
of 0.681 (p=1.0x 10-7). These results in fact fell within the
range of variation in model predictions across human
cohorts, with Pearson’s r ranging from 0.320 to 0.774 [58].
The average difference between predicted and known ages
was also comparable, with our mean difference (3.22 years)
falling in the upper range of values across human cohorts
(4.84-11.21 years) [58] after taking into account differences
in lifespan. This mean difference increased with age—for
instance, the average error in age predictions was 5.38 years
for animals over 15 years old—suggesting that human pre-
dictors may not capture ageing trajectories in older
macaques or that there may be greater heterogeneity in
