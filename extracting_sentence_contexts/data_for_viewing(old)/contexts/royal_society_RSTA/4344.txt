collisional broadening should be carefully considered for pressures larger than 1 Pa, as already
evidenced in [14]. More favourable ratios can be obtained from water, in the Doppler regime.
However, also in this case, for vapour pressures larger than 100 Pa, the A-ratio becomes smaller
than 30, thus suggesting the necessity of using sophisticated line shape models.

Figure 2 strongly supports the statement according to which the smaller is the A-ratio the
more sophisticated is the line shape model that is required. It shows the outcomes of spectral
analysis by means of the symmetric version of the speed-dependent Voigt profile performed on
4661 absorption spectra. These data were obtained at the Second University of Naples by using
a dual-laser water spectrometer operating at 1.4.m, described in detail elsewhere [12,49]. The
weighted mean of the Doppler widths of figure 2 gives the extraordinary result of 1.8 ppm in
terms of statistical uncertainty (calculated as the standard deviation of the weighted mean), but
the value itself is affected by a negative shift. This is the clear consequence of the fact that line
narrowing effects are not taken into account properly by the simplified model. In fact, using the
