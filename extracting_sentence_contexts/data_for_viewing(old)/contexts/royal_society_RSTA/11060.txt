ductivity made at 0°. This result justifies the amount of trouble and time expended
on the present investigation, and the comparison with Mr, Grirrrrus’ promised
measurements seems likely to give important information.

In comparing the diagrams for different substances, several results become evident.
The normal type of curve is apparently that shown in the-cases of potassium chloride,
barium chloride, &c., in which the ionization increases as dilution proceeds and
eventually reaches a maximum. On further dilution, the curve remains a horizontal
straight line, and it therefore seems right to conclude that the ionization has become
complete.

The abnormal shape of the curves for acids, observed when their conductivities are
measured at 18° or 25° in glass vessels, is seen to still represent the facts when the
conductivities are measured at 0° in platinum. At extreme dilution the equivalent
conductivity falls off at a very rapid rate, and the cause of this fall, whatever it may
be, is not removed by avoiding the use of glass or by taking the observations at the
freezing point.

It has been usual to explain this phenomenon by action between the acid and the
impurities present in the water; the result of the action being to reduce the effective
quantity of acid in solution by an amount which becomes appreciable at great dilution,
the substances formed having a smaller conductivity than the acid. The present
experiments, however, seem to furnish a certain amount of evidence against this view.

The quantity of such impurity must be very small, and it is probable therefore
