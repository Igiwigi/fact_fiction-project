assume a paroxysmal nature—the convulsions consisting of strong shudders and frequent
spasms with occasional intervals of repose.

Tn the case of Tiaropsis diademata the action of strychnia is very similar, with the
exception that there is no continuous spasm, although occas/onal ones occur amid the
twitching convulsions. After a time, however, all convulsions.cease, and the animal
remains quiescent. While in this condition its reflex excitability is abnormally
increased, as shown by the fact that even a gentle touch will bring on, not merely a
8ingle responsive spasm, as in the unpoisoned animal, but a whole series of successive
spasms, which are often followed by a paroxysm of twitching convulsions. "The condi-

S tion of exalted reflex irritability is thus exceedingly well marked. Recovery in normal
a water at this stage is rapid, the motions being at first characterized by a want of coor-
