As regards the incisors, two specimens of Myrmecobius in the Natural History
Museum present the interesting anomaly of possessing four instead of only three lower
incisors, the extra tooth being in each case clearly it—a fact which proves what has
generally been presumed to be the case, viz., that it is the fourth incisor that has
disappeared in ordinary three-incisored Mammals.

This completes the list of the living Dasyuride to be referred to, but one fossil
Marsupial, perhaps referable to the same family, and, although nearly the oldest-
known Mammal, strongly resembling the modern Phascologale, has a dentition of so
interesting a character as to call for special notice. This is the Triacanthodon serrula,
described by Sir R. Owen} from a single lower jaw found in the Mesozoic Purbeck
