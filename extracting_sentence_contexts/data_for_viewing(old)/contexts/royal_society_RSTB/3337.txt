through an actual nodule, and either shattering and somewhat crushing it, or
breaking it in half and slightly displacing the portions. Instances of this appearance are
illustrated in fig. 8, Plate 17, and fig. 9, Plate 18, but they are undoubtedly uncommon,
and were not easily found.

Fic. 1.—Portion of coal seam with “ coal balls” to show the bending of the lamin of the coal round
each nodule.

The fact that these larger calcareous nodules in the seam were left uncompressed,
while the coal around them underwent considerable reduction in vertical thickness, is
particularly well illustrated in the case of an exceptionally large mass which was
found in the mine at Shore.

Enormous “ Coal Ball.’—This single mass was estimated from measurements to
weigh at least 2 tons, and was several feet in diameter. It is seen in situ in fig. 4,
Plate 17, and a small part of it on a larger scale is depicted in fig, 9, Plate 18.
Where it is seen in the coal seam itself, it shows the great thickness of the mass in
comparison with the coal seam in which it lies, and which thins out to the normal foot

on either side. This enormous mass has entirely replaced the coal seam where it
occurs, leaving but a film of coal at the top and bottom, and as it is composed of solid
