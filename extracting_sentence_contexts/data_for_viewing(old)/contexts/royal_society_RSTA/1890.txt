chemical properties of the elements and that it was the atomic number, rather than atomic weight,
that defined the placement of elements in the table [1]. Likewise, Darwin did not know the laws
of inheritance and placed undue emphasis on the role of the environment in causing the random
generation of the heritable variation that was the essential foundation of evolution. Nevertheless,
both proposals were based on accurate observations and premises that were correct enough to
withstand the test of time and to be built upon by those who followed.

4. Darwin's theory

A key property that the theory of evolution shares with Mendeleev’s periodic table is that it
is based on observed facts. Darwin’s virtue, and the key to his success, was his remarkable
command of the diverse facts that define the natural history of plants and animals, living and
extinct. Darwin organized these facts to propose a process, natural selection, to explain how
species change over time. It is not mere speculation about how species form. The facts behind
natural selection are: (1) all organisms produce many more offspring than are required to replace
themselves in the next generation. This ‘overproduction’ of offspring means that all populations
have the capacity for rapid increase in the number of individuals, that they will soon pack
their environment to capacity and that there will be an ensuing struggle for existence to obtain


the resources required for survival and reproduction, (2) within every population of organisms ls |
one can find differences among individuals in characters that affect their ability to use their

environment, (3) these individual variations may influence the ability of individuals to survive 3
and reproduce, and may enable some individuals to occupy new ecological niches, and (4) these oS
