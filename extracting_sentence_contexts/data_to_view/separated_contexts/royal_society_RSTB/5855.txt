Comparable forms have also been described from the Triassic beds of
Australia.

14. A preliminary survey of the leaves associated with the reproductive structures
indicates that the forms from the Southern Hemisphere known as Dicroidium, “ Steno-
pteris,”’ Pachypteris, and probably Johnstonia are to be regarded as the leaves of the
Corystospermacese. This view is based mainly on the study of the gymnospermous
cuticles of these forms and also on the facts of association.

15. A new species of Lepidopteris, nearly related to Lepidopleris Ottonis of Greenland
and other Triassic localities in Kurope, is described with its seed-bearing branches. The
family Peltaspermacez is instituted for the reception of this form.
