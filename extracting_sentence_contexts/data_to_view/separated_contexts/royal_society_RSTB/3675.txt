The developing pineal nerves are very well shown in sections stained either with
Ehrlich’s hematoxylin and Orange G, or with borax carmine and picro-indigo-carmine. I have studied them in eight series of sections, of Stages O, P, Q, R, and 8, in
addition to those which I employed for my earlier work. In the latter they were not
nearly so well shown, owing to the fact that the sections were stained with borax

carmine alone.

a. Development of the Left Pineal Nerve.—Scuavrnstanp (1903), as I have
already pointed out, has, since my earlier observations were published, given a
drawing of a section (Taf. VIII, fig. 73) of an advanced embryo showing the
nerve of the pineal eye running from the eye itself to the superior (habenular)
commissure. He states that this nerve lies somewhat to one side of the middle
line, but does not say which side.
