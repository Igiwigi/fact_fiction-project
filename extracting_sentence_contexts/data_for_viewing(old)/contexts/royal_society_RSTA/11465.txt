§ 37. Before leaving Table XXXVIII. we may note its bearing on the laws
established in §§ 16 to 19 for change of reading under steady pressure. The data
deduced from the subsidiary stoppages at 21 and 18 inches, and the stoppages at
15 inches in the three standard experiments, are in good agreement with the laws
that the fall of ‘reading i in a given time during a stoppage, preceded by a reduction
of pressure at a uniform rate, is proportional to the pressure range, and that the
mode of variation of the reading with the time is independent of the range. The
first of these laws is supported by the closeness of the “‘mean” and “ theoretical ”
ratios, the second by the absence of any clear tendency in the ratios of the falls at
the specitied intervals to either increase or decease as the intervals become longer.

Further support of the first law is supplied by the fact that the mean observed
falls Sone 26 hours’ exposure to the pressures of 21, 18, and 16 inches were respec-
tively “13, 195, and ‘226 inch, and we have

13/9: =,014, 193/12 = "0161, "226/14 = OLGZ,
values nearly equal.

A very interesting point is that the ratios borne by the falls at 15 inches pressure,
in the several experiments where a subsidiary stoppage existed, to the corresponding
falls in the standard experiments are, to all appearance, constant throughout the
hour’s stoppage at 15. There are, of course, irregularities in the figures, but there
