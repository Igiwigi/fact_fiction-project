The first striking change in the respiration observed is the diminution in the depth. The movement of the abdomen on inspiration becomes less marked and soon is
confined to the anterior half of the belly. Later the thoracic inspiratory movement
becomes unusually obvious, and may in fact play a greater part than the abdominal. The expiratory movement of the belly becomes marked and the nostrils show laboured
breathing. All these indications of deficient a√©ration are remarkably weak, so that
they form a contrast to the laboured breathing of ordinary asphyxia, and the presence
of various weak movements in the thorax and abdomen gives the impression of a lack
of co-ordination of the respiratory muscles.
