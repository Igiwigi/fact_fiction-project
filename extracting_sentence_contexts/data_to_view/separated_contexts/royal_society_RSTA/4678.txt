In [1] and in many recent papers ([2,3] and references therein), emphasis is given to the
effect of reflection/transmission and only in minor part to SW propagation and local impedance
modulation, which is instead the main focus of this article. In particular, here it is shown how a
proper impedance modulation allows one to address SWs along desired curvilinear paths. In fact,
the impedance modulation, obtained by locally changing the sizes of the patches, imposes a local
modification of the dispersion equation and hence, at constant operating frequency, of the local
wavevector. The general effects of MTS modulation may be therefore treated in the framework of
transformation optics (TO) [4,5]. TO establishes a rigorous analytical rule for obtaining a control
on wave propagation within inhomogeneous anisotropic metamaterials.
