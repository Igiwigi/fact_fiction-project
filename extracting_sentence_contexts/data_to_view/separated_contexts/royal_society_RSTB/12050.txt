A number of recent efforts have attempted to model birdsong
and other animal vocalizations using the formal language hier-
archy, also known as the Chomsky hierarchy (for review, see
[24,90]). The formal language hierarchy captures the nested
levels of complexity of all logically possible patterns and
describes the computational machinery necessary to recognize
strings of a formal language. Human syntactic patterns require
at least context-free machinery, meaning the capacity is needed
to store symbols in a memory stack from which the symbol can
later be popped off and compared with an incoming element
[25,90].
