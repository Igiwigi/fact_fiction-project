The
primitive algebra thus arising is also associative and commutative. The first of these two primitive algebras is distributive as regards the second. In
fact the compound algebra composed of the two primitive algebras is of the same kind
as the ordinary algebra of quantity, the units 5, 2, , corresponding respectively to the
oo, 0, and 1 of 8uch algebra.*

310. We may speak of the collection consisting of the products of the pairs
connecting two component collections of a system S as the product of those collections,
If the number of units in the multiplier collection be n, and the number of those in
the multiplicand be m, the number in the product will not necessarily be mn, for the
product a of a connecting pair ap may be the same unit as the product of another
connecting pair bg. We may speak of the collection consisting of the products of all
the pairs of a collection , b, c, d . . . . together with the products (aa), (bb), (ce). Â« -
as the 8quare of the collection a, b, c, 4....
