Exp. 1. Repeated observations and measurements satisfy us of this fact. We may
either receive the images on a chart at various distances from the double edge in-
strument, approacking the edges until the fringes appear, or we may receive them
on a plate of ground glass held between the sun and the eye. We may thus measure
them with a micrometer; but no such nicety is required, because their increase in
breadth is manifest.
