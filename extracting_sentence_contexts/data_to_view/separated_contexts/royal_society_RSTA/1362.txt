Hence M;5 is the locus of vertices of cones of &. Some of these cones have their
vertices on ¢;. In fact the surfaces [ project from any point P of c, by means of o!
such cones which have all the same vertex P, and which have in common the elliptic
quartic cone Ky by which c, is projected. The section of these is an ordinary pencil of
quadric surfaces. ‘This contains four cones which, joined to P, give the four line cones
of © whose vertices pass through a given point of cs.
