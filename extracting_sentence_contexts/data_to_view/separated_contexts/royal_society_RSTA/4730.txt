In the model, all three rates are those suggested in
[67]. If (4.11) is decreased, the reaction flux shifts towards the production of methoxy radical,
which will increase the relative concentration of formaldehyde when compared with methanol. The model was recomputed with a factor of 5 decrease in (4.11), but the relative concentration
of formaldehyde to methanol was minimally affected owing to the fact that most of the methoxy


is recycled to methyl radical, which loops back to the production of methanol (figure 7). Thus,
changing (4.11) has a non-monotonic effect on the formaldehyde to methanol ratio. In the original
paper measuring (4.12) by Slemr & Warneck [69], the reaction is suggested to proceed through an
alternative reaction pathway that results in the direct formation of formaldehyde

which is dominant over the channel recommended by Tsang ef al. [67].
