Mr. CLirT, upon a former occasion, made a drawing of the
testicles and ovarium of the lamprey, in which the parts were
only sufficiently enlarged to identify the facts they were in-
tended to demonstrate. I have now, to establish them more
completely, taken advantage of Mr. Bavx's superior kill in


142 Sir EVERARD HOME on the double organs of

the use of the microscope to give, upon the same plate, the
ovarium of the lamprey, and of the conger ; wishing in my
demonstration of such curious facts, that had escaped the
accurate observation of Joun HUNTER, they should, as far
as may be, speak for themselves.
