Prof. J. P. Hm, I have myself had the opportunity of studying in Siphonops, are found
beneath the skin, in connection at one end with a series of small segmentally placed
lymph hearts, and opening at the other into large thin-walled lymph channels disposed in
various parts of the body. The vessels are narrow tubes with thick, highly elastic walls,
which are stated by Marcus to consist largely of muscle.

The similarity in structure between these Amphibian lymphatics aad the “ fine”
vessels of Lophius has probably no morphological significance, but it shows that such
a structure, though unusual, is in no way incompatible with the character of a lymphatic.

Summary.

So far as one can judge from the facts ascertained, there are in Lophius and in the
cod, and probably in other Teleostean fishes, lymphatic vessels of two kinds, differing
from one another in structure and contents :—

1. An extensive system of vessels of the ordinary lymphatic type ; delicate in structure,
irregular in outline, inclining to lacunar or sinus-like expansion ; separable into regional
but freely intercommunicating systems; draining lymph with a slight admixture of
red blood corpuscles from all parts of the body and viscera ; opening directly into the
veins through sinus-like reservoirs situated in the head or fore-part of the body.

These are the lymphatics that have been described in greater or less detail by ALLEN,
Trois, FouMaNN, and many others.
