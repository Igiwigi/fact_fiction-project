My own opinion is that in the present state of our knowledge the case is not proved
either for the phyllome theory, which is out of harmony with the known facts in the
fossils, or for the non-phyllome theory, which certainly is a less obvious explanation of
the Hquisetum strobilus. But the balance of evidence seems in favour of the latter,
as without undue pressure it covers the whole area of facts, while it harmonises also
with what is seen in other groups of Pteridophytes.

(5). Toe Type oF THE FILICINEA.

In view of the difference in construction of the sporophyte in Ferns from that of the
strobiloid Pteridophyta, it is necessary first to inquire what are the probable relations
of these series. In point of time the distinction of habit dates back as far as the
earliest known fossils, and accordingly it is only by comparison that any opinion can
be formed as to their origin by descent, and then only as a probability, not a
demonstration. The similarity of life-history shows, however, that the sporophyte
of the Fern as a whole corresponds to that of the strobiloid types ; the further question
will then be as to the correspondence of the parts, especially the axis and leaf.
