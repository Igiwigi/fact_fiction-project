wave-length of the primary radiation differs least from that of the fluorescent
radiation. As the wave-length of the primary radiation diminishes the fraction so

where all else is regular, is evidence of their unreliability except as indicating orders of magnitude: the
reason is obvious. If these values could be experimentally determined with accuracy, they would
probably be quite different from those obtained by the use of a perfectly homogeneous radiation of wave-
length given in column IT. Still, this fact would not appreciably affect the conclusions drawn below,
because the values are compared with corresponding absorptions—that is, with the absorptions of identical
radiations.

transformed diminishes also, the relation being almost a linear one within the range
of these experiments.

[Originally the writer determined the wave-length of a primary radiation from the
speed of the electrons it ejects, 7.e., from the equation 4mv* = hn, where h is PLanck’s
constants, —v being obtained from Wuupprneron’s law. These results are plotted
