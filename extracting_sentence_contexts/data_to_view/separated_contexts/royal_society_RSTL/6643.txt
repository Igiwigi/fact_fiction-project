S But the observers last mentioned seem to have had more prominently in view the
Z question of the influence of plants upon the media with which they were surrounded,
A than that of the influence of these media in contributing materially to the increased
substance of plants themselves. Following closely on their footsteps, both in point of
time and in general plan of research, came Ds SavssURE. His labours were conducted
towards the end of the last century and in the beginning of the present one ; and their
results, and the arguments he founded upon them, published by him in 1804, may be
84id to have indicated, if not indeed established, many of the most important facts with
Which we are yet acquainted regarding the sources of the constituents stored up by the
growing plant. To Dx SavssURE we owe the experimental, and even quantitative, illus-
tration of the fact, that plants in sunlight increase in their amounts of carbon, hydro-
gen, and oxygen, at the expense of carbonic acid and of water. It is remarkable, too,
that, in the case of the main experiment, he cites on the point, he, with his yery imper-
