same level as the © Dipnoi” amongst the Fishes ; the external nostril (e.n.) and the
internal (5.n.) lie on the same plane; a free intervening growth of cartilage, binding
the arches together, with no further metamorphosis of the parts, would produce a true
parallel to the skull of those remarkable Fish. The sinuosities of the upturned palate
(fig. 4), its plaits and its crevices, are easily understood by reference to the diagram
(fig. 5).

PFirst Preoral Arch.—The trabecular rods form together an elegantly lyriform struc-
ture; they already have begun their extensive © commissure,” being parallel now in
their fore half. Behind, they are like callipers, and the blades are at some distance from
each other; their apices, sharpened off, seem to approach the fore end of the investing
mass (#.v.) ; but a sectional view (fig. 6, tr.cm., 7.v.) corrects this error, and shows that these
diverse parts lie on a totally distinct plane and far from each other, a fact I pointed out
long ago in my paper on the Frog (Phil. Trans. 1871, Plate 111. p. 143). These trabe-
cular blades embrace the pituitary body ( py.); but their curve does not conform to
its shape, and is altogether independent of it, being the proper © habit ” or morpholo-
gical fashion of the arch. After forming the elegant, pyriform, primordial pituitary
space, the trabecule become thicker, narrower, and liz closely side by side; this is 800n
followed by fusion of their edges—the formation of the trabecular commissure (see
Plate XXIX. fig. 4, tr.em.). These two rods do not end as a straight bar, but in front

* In my paper on the Frog (Phil. Trans, 1871, p. 148) the pterygo-palatine arcade is described as a secondary
8tructure ; in that on the Salmon (ibid. 1878, p. 109) it is spoken of as independent. 4? is @ 8econdary arch.
