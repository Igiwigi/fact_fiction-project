The writer does not wish to create the impression that
hydrogen never exerts a direct influence on the magnitude of the negative leak. The numbers on
p. 53 show that the value of the ionisation, at constant temperature, increases with the pressure of
the hydrogen at high pressures; so that it is probable that at high pressures there is a negative leak
which is a definite function of the pressure of the hydrogen. This is also demanded by the fact that the
constant _, which enters into the temperature formula, is dependent on the pressure. A comparison of the table at the top of page 53 with that on page 52 would seem to indicate that the
ionisation in hydrogen at 1:9 millims. pressure is much greater than in a hydrogen vacuum, The writer
considers, however, that these experiments are not comparable with one another, owing to the wires having
been differently treated before the two experiments.
