In the slow fluctuation limit v’/A— 0 and for A to be finite, we have f—>
constant. In the fast fluctuation limit, A/v’—+0 and we expect A—0. The
asymptotic form is in fact linear in the small parameter, f(1/e) ~~ «¢. The two
solutions thus become

Aslow ~ A (15.3)
and

Jiast: ~ vy (15.4)

formulae that are often used for the analysis of wSR data. These formulae may be rationalized by the following heuristic argument.
