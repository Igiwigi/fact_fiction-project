comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) from lines in the millimetre range [21]. Although most molecules are
observed at millimetre wavelengths, the infrared domain gives access to molecules with no dipole
moment such as CO2, CH and other symmetric hydrocarbons. Observations in the ultraviolet
and visible wavelength range sample signatures of radicals, atoms and ions that are photolysis
and chemical products of parent molecules released from the nuclear ices. UV spectra allowed
the identification of S, and show strong signatures of CO. Table 1 provides a list of 28 molecules
(other than H20) identified in comets and the range of measured abundances relative to water
(see figure 2 for the number of comets in which each molecule has been detected). The wavelength
domains, where the molecular signatures are observed, are indicated in table 1. This list includes
CS, SO and NS, which are in fact radicals. CS and SO are photo-dissociation products of CS
and SOy, respectively. However, direct release of SO from the nuclear ices is suggested from the
ROSINA data [16]. The origin of the NS radical is unknown [22].

3. Molecular abundances and composition diversity

From the composition of cometary atmospheres, the main components of cometary nuclear ices
are water (about 80% by number), followed by CO2, CO, CH30H, CHyg, H2S and NH3 (figure 2).
An investigation of the CO2 abundance in 17 comets using the AKARI space telescope shows that
COz dominates over CO in most comets [6]. Abundances of cometary parent molecules detected
by spectroscopy range from less than 0.01% to 20% relative to water, and generally decrease
with increasing complexity, except for hydrocarbons (table 1). Some species, as observationally
demonstrated for HNC and H2CO [23], may be produced by distributed sources of gases (e.g.
