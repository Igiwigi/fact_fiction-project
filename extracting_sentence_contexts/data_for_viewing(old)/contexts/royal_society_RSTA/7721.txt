two variables equivalent to assigning a value to the time of some other frame of
reference.

Now let us consider the tube S$ as the locus of a point whose coordinates x,y, z, ¢
are functions of two parameters u,v. The curve C is that line on S for which, say,
J (u,v) =0. Such a relation between wu and v corresponds to a value of the time in
some system of coordinates (provided, of course, that Cis a time-like section). What
we have previously called the epoch, namely, a particular relation between u and v, such
as f (u, v) = 0, has in fact, to correspond to the time in some system of coordinates.

Let C, and C, be two curves on § corresponding to the epochs 4, and 2, specified
by fq (u, v) = 0 and fy (u, v) = 0 respectively, which in turn correspond to the times
t, and ft, in two different systems of coordinates. If the parameters w and v are

normalized so that \\ du dv integrated over the uo-plane between the curves 4, and

hg is equal to the area of the tube S between the curves C, and C, in general, {| du dv

is invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations and is a measure of the separation
of 2, and 2, (cf. § 1), which corresponds to proper time in the motion of a particle.
The time at a particular instant in any system of coordinates, at least of the Lorentz
