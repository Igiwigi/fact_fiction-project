Box 4. Rewilding rangelands.

Livestock and extensive grazing land have increased rapidly during recent decades, with severe environmental consequences =
[93]. There is much to gain, especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, if we are able to replace livestock with native s
wildlife and, particularly, more non-ruminants [94]. A decade ago, Wilson & Edwards [95] estimated that replacing cattle a
with native megafauna (low-emission kangaroos) in amounts with equivalent meat production would reduce annual ey
country-wide and the agricultural sector’s greenhouse gas emissions in Australia by 3% and 28%, respectively. They also =
suggest higher profitability of kangaroo farming over livestock farming. Something similar has been shown for African ran- a
gelands, where native wildlife ranching may, particularly in more arid and less productive conditions, be more profitable S
than livestock farming [96]. Rewilding rangelands would not only come with economic and greenhouse emission benefits. &
It could, for example, also have major advantages for human health since game meat contains higher proportions of unsa-
turated fatty acids [97]. In fact, a central aspect of rewilding our rangelands should include rewilding our diet, where the =
focus should be on eating less meat and eating proportionally more non-ruminant meat (kangaroos, suids, equids, camelids). =
Moreover, it could contribute towards restoring degraded rangelands, including issues with soil degradation and hydrology a
[94]. Cloete et al. [96] highlighted that there may be high capital investments involved with converting a traditional farm into =
a game farm. However, if this leads to major reductions in greenhouse emissions, governments should consider subsidizing <
such capital investments through ‘green subsidies’ or green tax benefits. Rewilding the farm could also reduce perceived con- =
flicts with increasing ungulate populations and agriculture across the Northern Hemisphere. By integrating the use of these Pe]
ungulates in the land use/farming system, where ungulates are harvested and sold as game meat, farmers could compensate S
their crop losses due to ungulate damage with income from meat. 3
