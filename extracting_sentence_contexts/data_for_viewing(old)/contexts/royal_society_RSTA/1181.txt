by these materials, and even Pluto seems to consist of more rock than ice [84]. Indeed it was shown
that the observed properties of the planets can be fit also with a rock-dominated composition
[63], and recently, it has been suggested that Neptune could be a ‘rock-giant’ based on measured
atmospheric abundances (see Teanby et al. [85] and references therein for further details). Also,
although the argument that the planets must consist of large fractions of water to have high
enough electrical conductivities (ionic/super-ionic water) to generate their magnetic fields is
convincing (e.g. Redmer et al. [86]), it is yet to be determined how much water is required and
whether other materials could contribute to the ionic interior.

In addition, even if the planets have substantial amounts of volatile materials (e.g. water), in
their deep interiors, the physical state of the material would not be in a solid state, and therefore
it is inappropriate to describe the materials as ‘ices’ since they would be in the liquid (fluid) state.
This is in fact also true for Jupiter and Saturn which are called the ‘gas giants’, because their
composition is dominated by hydrogen (H), although the material in their deep interiors is not
in the gaseous phase. Similarly, we suggest that calling Uranus and Neptune ‘ice giants’ is rather
misleading. This name biases the community to think of these planets as being water- (volatiles)
dominated and also gives the wrong impression for the physical state of the material in their deep
interiors. We, therefore, propose that naming Uranus and Neptune ‘sub-giants’ or ‘outer-giants’
instead of ‘ice giants’ is more appropriate.?

6. Summary and future plans

Uranus and Neptune remain mysterious planets and it is clear that further exploration of these
planets theoretically and observationally is needed. Key fundamental questions regarding Uranus
and Neptune remain open, such as
