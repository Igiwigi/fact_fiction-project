The chief diseases which cause the excess of M. deaths among whites above 5 yeurs
are: diseases of the digestive system, including enteritis (M. 689, F. 383); typhoid
(M. 124, F. 61); malaria (M. 244, F. 88); diseases of the nervous system (especially
meningitis) and tetanus. (M, 5038, F. 280); bronchitis and other respiratory diseases
(M. 762, F. 679); giving a total of M. 2322, F. 1491, that is an excess of M. 831 for
the single year 1905.

If the interpretation I have put upon the facts is true, it is clear that an excess of
F. births over deaths is not necessarily a true indication of the virility of a people,
for the excess of F, adults may be gained in consequence of a high death-rate among
M. (whites in Cuba). At the same time it is evident that the mere production of a
large proportion of F. does not necessarily ensure a high birth-rate, for the proportion
may be greatly reduced by death before their reproductive power has been fully
exercised (coloured in Cuba).

That the initial virility of a race may be judged in accordance with the proportion
of F. births I see no reason to doubt, but it is necessary the individual should repro-
duce before any practical effect can be exercised on the race.

It is important these generalisations should be borne in mind in considering the
