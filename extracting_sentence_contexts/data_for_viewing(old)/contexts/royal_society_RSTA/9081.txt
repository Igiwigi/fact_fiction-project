present in the three aerolites, El Nakhla, Aubres, and Bustee. A mixture
containing chromium 0°25 per cent. and nickel 0°04 per cent. gave a oe
which for Cr-Ni was practically identical with that of Aubres.

The estimation made in this way cannot be more than a “‘good sigouciieaaaes on
account of unavoidable variations, due to intensity of light and time of exposure ;
also to conditions of photographic development, which cannot be exactly controlled,
but the indications given by the relative intensities of closely adjacent Ni and Cr
lines when they occur on the same film are very much more exact, and the result
proves that in these aerolites the element chromium exists in greater abundance than
nickel.

To this fact must be added that of the almost total absence of chromium in the
familiar nickeliferous irons of the siderites.

In a general survey of the spectrum analyses of the 30 aerolites which forms the
subject of this Paper, the most striking fact is their similarity in composition, and
the small number of elements represented. Making full allowance for wide
differences in the photographic activity of the are spectra of the elements, it is
remarkable that we only see with certainty the lines due to some ten bodies, and of
these ten, four only—iron, chromium, magnesium, and nickel--appear to be present
in quantity. With three exceptions, Bustee, E] Nakhla, and Aubres, the proportion
between these elements appears to be practically the same in all.

This suggests that these earthy meteorites must have a common origin, and that
