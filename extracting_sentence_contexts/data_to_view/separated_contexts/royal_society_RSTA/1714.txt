Let us remark that the above assertion b) can be regarded as an extension
of a classical result due to Borchers & Sohr [42] for 1 < p < o to the case p = 00. The approach developed in [22] even gives pointwise upper bounds for the solution of the Stokes
equation on L3°(@). In fact, for u > 0,q € [1,00] and (z,x,L,u9) € Ex/2 x R" x Ry x L®(Q) define

~3y z|H/2
B,(z,x,L, uo) := |Molln(B@,Lyn@)lZl “4 + |IUolloo Ct ge

Then the following result holds. Theorem 3.10 ([22]). Let n > 3, 2 C R" be an exterior domain of class Cl where 1>3.and1> n/2and
let 0 € (0, /2),q €[1, 00] and zp > 0.
