It
appears to me, that the effects will be the most sensible in
large and powerful needles; and consequently, in making
use of such, the reduction for a variation of temperature will

be most necessary. There would be no difficulty in this
reduction, if we could: give in terms of the intensity of any
magnet the increment or decrement of intensity correspond-
ing to a certain decrement or increment of temperature at all
temperatures. To determine this accurately, would however
require a great variety of experiments to be made with
magnets of very different intensities ; but as I have not made
these, I must- content myself for the present with pointing
out some of the facts-which I have ascertained from more
extended experiments than those I have already given, re-
serving the detail of these experiments for another oppor-
tunity, should they be deemed of sufficient interest. These experiments were made with a balance of torsion,
the needle being 'suspended by a brass wire 4; inch in
diameter : by them I ascertained the following facts :

to a temperature 127?, as the temperature of the magnets
increased, their intensity decreased.
