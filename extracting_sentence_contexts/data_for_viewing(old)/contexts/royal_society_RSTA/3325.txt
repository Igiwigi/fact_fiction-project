Equation (3.4a) is equivalent to the incompressible Euler equations for an irrotational fluid,
while equation (3.4b) expresses that the velocity field at the free surface is purely tangential
(kinematic boundary condition). Equation (3.4c) is equivalent to the constant pressure constraint
at the free surface (dynamic boundary condition), while equation (3.4d) reflects the fact that the
velocity field is purely tangential at the flat bed.

In [2], it has been proved that system (3.4) is equivalent to the following one-dimensional
pseudo-differential equation:

for an unknown function w€ im o” as well as an unknown constant h. Here, Cy, is the Fourier

multiplier defined in (2.23), h is the mean depth (3.6), k is the wavenumber (3.7) and
