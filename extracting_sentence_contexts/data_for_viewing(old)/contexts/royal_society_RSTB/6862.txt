184 I. MANTON ON EVIDENCE ON SPIRAL STRUCTURE

difficult owing to their smaller diameter. In fig. 69, Plate 19, only an approximate
count can be made of the spirals at this stage, but uncertainty is removed by the very
clear single chromosome shown in fig. 70. This is a lost chromosome from the second
division in a triploid and it has 8 small coils.

Corresponding details for the chromosomes of an ordinary mitosis are even more
difficult to obtain, owing to the fact that the technique cannot be applied to a tissue,
hut only to isolated cells. Spore mother cells can readily be isolated by smearing, but
those of the tissue of the sporangium in the premeiotic division are too compact to be
separated. The same difficulty applies to other growing parts such as roots, and only
quite exceptional mitotic cells such as pollen grains (Allium, Geitler 1938; Tradescantia,
Sax and Sax 1935) or pollen tubes (Tulipa, Upcott 1935) have so far been worked at
all with the spiral structure technique. Fortunately, in Osmunda, mitotic figures may
still be found in the tapetum till well on into meiosis, and, though infrequent, it does
sometimes happen that somatic chromosomes from this source can be obtained in a
smear of mother cells. Observation of the spirals is even more difficult in these than
at the second division, owing to their greater length, but the chromosome marked with
an arrow in fig. 71, Plate 19, has certainly in the region of 14 coils. It is possible
that in this chromosome the number 14 is an under-estimate and the real number of
