So also
from a simultaneous enumeration of the numbers living in each year of age, the two
columns d, and 7, of the life could be constructed without reference to any registry of
the deaths at different ages. The mean age at death in such a community would express the mean lifetime, or the
expectation of life at birth; and the product of the number expressing the annual
births multiplied into the mean age at death would give the numbers of the popula-
tion. The facts which a Life-Table expresses in numbers may be represented by the lines
of a figure; age (Â«) being indicated by the abscissas measured from 0, the numbers
living (1) at each age by the ordinates of a curve line, and the numbers living between
any two ages by the plane surface within the two ordinates, the curve line, and the
corresponding portion of the abscissa. The relative numbers living at the ages 20 and
21 are seen in the two lines of Plate XLII. fig.
