â€˜WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) is a
term originally coined by Henrich, Heine & Norenzayan [40]. In
the social sciences, researchers have relied on a rather narrow demo-
graphic of college-aged students primarily from the global North. For
decades, theorists have generalized findings from this research to
humans at large, resulting in many misconceptions regarding cul-
tural universals and variation. As the acronym implies, there is
accumulating evidence that rather than being anywhere near a typi-
cal human demographic, WEIRD individuals are in fact extreme on
many relevant dimensions for research on cognition and behaviour.
For a recent discussion of ramifications, see [41].
