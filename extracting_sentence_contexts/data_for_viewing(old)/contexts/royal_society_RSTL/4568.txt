giving a mean of 18,590 Ibs. for the strength of single-riveted joints. Now in the
Second and third experiments, Table VII., with the rivets inserted in the shape of an
i80sceles triangle (which in fact is double riveting), and of equal sections to the speci-
mens in Table VI., the mean breaking weight is 23,035, which gives an excess of 4445,
or a ratio of 10 : 8 in fayour of the experiments recorded in Table VII.

In the experiments (Table X.), the area of the section, taken through the line of the
rivet-holes, is :44 inch, or precisely equal to the section of the specimens experimented
upon in Table VI., in which the mean breaking weight is 18,590 Ibs. In these expe-
riments the breaking weight is 23,707 Ibs., which is rather more than that in Table IX.,
where the material had a smaller section, but having its dimensions exactly corre-
sponding with the proportions given above. It therefore follows that in plates jointed
with single rivets, the ratio of the strength of the single rivets is to that of the double-
riveted joints as 8 to 10, the latter being one-fourth stronger.
