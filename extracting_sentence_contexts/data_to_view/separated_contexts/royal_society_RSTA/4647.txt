Not only will the low-level amplification then be lost, which could be compensated
for with a high-gain hearing aid, but the compression effect of the cochlear amplifier will also
disappear, making a higher level sound feel uncomfortably loud if such a high-gain hearing aid
is used. Nonlinear damping thus plays an important role in the normal functioning of our sense of
hearing and has been used for some years to explain the dynamic behaviour of the cochlea [5,50,
51]. In fact, the analysis of cochlear mechanics is more complicated than suggested above, since
the dynamic response at each point along the cochlea is coupled with all the other points, owing
to the fluid motion in the cochlea fluid chambers. A full nonlinear analysis has to take account
of this interaction, for example, by iteratively taking a first approximation to the nonlinear local
behaviour, linearly coupling each of these via the fluids and then obtaining a better approximation
to the nonlinear local responses at each individual position along the cochlea. This iterative quasi-
linear approach was originally developed for tonal excitation and for combinations of tones
[52,53] but has also been used for broadband random excitation [54,55], using cross-correlation
methods with a theory that is similar to those discussed in §5, which in this field is called the
equivalent nonlinear or EQ-NL theorem [56].
