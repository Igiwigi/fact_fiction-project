Jacost’s method appears to me open to the serious objection that it is necessary
to its validity that the first (2n—1) fluxion of Sy should be continuous ; so that the
discussion only proves that a curve AB fuifilling the synclastie condition gives a
better result than any infinitely near curve fulfilling the same limiting conditions, and
which is continuous to the 2n* flusion of y. And it would not show that it was not
possible to find other broken curves fulfilling the same limiting conditions, and giving,
at our pleasure, a value to the integral either greater or less than that given by the
curve AB. Thus, for instance, in the case of least action, it would not show that the
action in the free trajectory was less than in any constrained path (which it is, in fact),
but only that it was less than that in any path for which the tangent deauk bert oan
position at every point. To show for the general case that Jacozr’s proof assumes

this continuity of $y Would require a large amount of work, but it will be sufficient for
our purpose to take the simple case where the function to be made synclastic contains
only «, y, and y. Let us apply his general method to the integral *
