We should again conclude from this result
that fecundity is inherited, although it offers less strong evidence than the previous
case. The influence of selectiont is at once apparent in the great reduction of the
variabilities. The fact that we are throwing the determination of fecundity more
on to the old age period of life appears from the reduced mean fecundities. I
attribute the reduction in the fecundity-correlation to this source, 7.c., the very diverse
treatment which old mares receive at the hands of different breeders. (iv.)
