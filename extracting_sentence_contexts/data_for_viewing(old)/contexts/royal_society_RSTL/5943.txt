of the same annular spaces. If now the peduncles and the attached tubes be cut away
by a curved SCis8Ors as near as possible to the abdominal surface, and then placed on a
glass slide $0 as to admit of being examined under the microscope, it will be discovered
that the tube and peduncle of the testicular mass run into one another (as shown in
fig. 7 @, 6, c) and that the outlet (4) is common to the peduncle (4) and the ciliated
tube (5). This outlet cannot be detected on the external tegumentary surface of the
animal; it is far too minute and closely contracted. No orifice can be discovered
even in specimens preserved in spirits. But its position may be clearly ascertained by
Sthe position of the attached extremity, internally, of the ciliated tube. The confluence
of the peduncle of the testes and base of the ciliated tube is a fact of great homological
Syalue. It proves that the generative gland is an outgrowth from, and organically the
development of the & segmental organ.”
© Itis a fact which brings the generative system of this worm, hitherto 80 incompre-
Shensible, within the rule which governs the formation of this system in the Annelida in
Seneral®,
Z The two ciliated tubes, one on either side, which are contained in this testicular ring,
Sdiffer in no respect whatever from those (fig. 5) of the non-generative rings, but in that
2vf ze. They are considerably larger than the latter, 80 much 80 as to be quite visible
Sto the naked eye.
Z The botryoidal vascular appendage (fig. 5, 9g g) exhibits the same character. The
£tubal portion (5 e) is only more densely coiled and complicated. 'The umbrella-shaped
Zextremity is very large, and the cilia act with great force. Neither HerNG, DE QUaTRE-
Spacns, nor GEGENBAUER allude anywhere in their writings to the fact, which is 80 signi-
Eficant i in a homological sense, of the increased size of the ciliated tubes of the generative
ſegments in Lumbricus.
