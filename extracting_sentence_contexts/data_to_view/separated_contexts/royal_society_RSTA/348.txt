A fuller discussion of the use of X-ray spectra in order
to determine the level system of the valence electron in a solid is to be found in a recent
article (Skinner 1939). The investigation of the spectra of light elements of the first two groups of the
periodic table lies in the foreground of our problem. This is mainly because, for
technical reasons, these substances show the spectra which are most suitable for
detailed interpretation; in fact, the resolution is greatest. Further, in the first instance,
it is better to confine attention to solids made up of single elements; since, although
work has been done on chemical compounds, the general interpretation is naturally
likely to be more difficult. Therefore, in this first paper, we shall only deal with the
element metals and element insulators of the first two groups.
