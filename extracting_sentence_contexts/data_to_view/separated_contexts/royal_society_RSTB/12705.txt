They talked about adult cognition, communi-
cation, culture and cooperation and emphasized adult activities such as
hunting, warfare and building [10]. The distinctively long human childhood
received less attention and was even treated as epiphenomenal, a side-effect
of narrow pelvises and large brains, rather than a phenomenon with potential
adaptive significance itself (see [11]). A few psychologists pointed, in a general
way, to the fact that a long childhood allows a long period of learning [12-14]. THE ROYAL SOCIETY
