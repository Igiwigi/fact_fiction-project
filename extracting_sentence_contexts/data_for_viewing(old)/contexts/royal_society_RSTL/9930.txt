402 MESSRS, J. B. LAWES AND J. H. GILBERT ON THE RESULTS OF

A comparison of Table XXXI. with Table XXIX. will show that the excess of Pro=
duce over the average was very much less in 1868 than in 1869, and that it was the
most considerable under the influence of highly nitrogenous in conjunction with
mineral manures. Indeed, with mineral manures alone (plot 7) the increase was very
8mall, and without manure there was even a considerable deficiency in this 8eason,
which nevertheless is taken as, upon the whole, illustrative of high productiveness.
There are, in fact, other seasons giving more produce on one or other of the plots ;
but, excepting 1869, there is no other that gives 80 much on each of the three selected
highly-manured plots. The season was, therefore, one of great luxuriance with high
manuring, but of deficient growth with low manuring.

The season of 1874 gave more uniformly bad results than did that of 1868 give
uniformly good ones ; the produce being the twentieth, or lowest, in order of amount on
two of the highly-manured plots, seventeenth on the third, eighteenth on the mineral
manured, and seventeenth on the unmanured plot.

The difference between the produce of the two seasons was the most marked where
ammonia-salts were used; there being about 1 ton less hay in 1874 than in 1868 where
the smaller amount of ammonia-salts was applied (plot 9), and nearly 2 tons less with
