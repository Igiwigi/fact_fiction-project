minute inquiries, the errors of obseryation are sure to baffle us in our object.

A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM. 471

Captain Sapixng however has' preferred trusting to actual experiment for
this minute correction : and, considering that the result shown by the knife
edge A'is the nearest to the truth, he has rested on the establishment of that
result, without the requisite corroboration, by an equal number of trials, from
the other knife edge ; which are, in fact, equally essential to the establishment
of the accuracy of the whole. Thus, he has swung the pendulum 188 hours
on the knife edge A, and only 54 hours on the knife edge B. But, had this
latter knife edge been employed-during a longer period, it might probably have
tended to correct the anomaly that occurs on the face of the observations.
For, it appears that when the slider was moved about -133 inch, it caused an
increase of 0-10 vibration in a day, on the knife edge A; whilst it caused a
decrease of 112 vibration on the knife edge B. But, this is contrary to the
known principles of the pendulum, since the effect of a slider of this sort is to
cause an alteration of the same kind in each knife edge, differing only in degree:
the relative proportions of which may he ascertained by determining the di-
stance of the centre of gravity from each knife edge *, In the state of the pen-
dulum in question, when last used by Captain Sapins for the experiments here
