JONES ON THE STRUCTURE

before it can be received into the excretory duct ; and lastly, if correct, they seem to
establish that the liver is not widely removed from the class of glands destitute of
efferent ducts, like them allowing a part of its elaborated products to return at once
into the blood, from whence as plasma they had been derived. On a future occasion
I trust to have the opportunity of examining more closely into the function of the
liver. I may however at present remark, that if the capillary radicles of the portal
vein absorb the saccharine and amylaceous matters from the intestines, it seems a
wise provision that the blood s0 charged should percolate intimately a vast mass of
cells, which may specially act on the newly-absorbed materials, retain them if they
are in excess, convert them into biliary compounds, and again allow them to return,
as needed, into the circulating current : this in fact is nearly the view proposed by
Messrs. Boucnarpar and SanDRas. I have, lastly, to speak of the relation which the
excretory ducts, before described, hold to the lobules of the parenchyma.
