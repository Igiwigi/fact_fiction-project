that errors in rerum naturd result from the superposition of a large number of
minuter errors arising from a number of independent sources,—when submitted to
mathematical analysis, leads to the law which is generally received; as far therefore as
this hypothesis is in accordance with fact, s0 far is the law practically true, Fully to
decide how far this hypothesis does agree with facts is an extremely subtle question in
philosophy, which would embrace not only an extended inquiry into the laws of the
material universe, but an examination of the senses and faculties of man, which form an
important element in the generation of error, Still, without pretending to enter on a
demonstration of the truth of this hypothesis, a few reflections upon the facts, especially
in the case of Astronomy (which is par excellence the science of obseryation, and where
accordingly the lessons of experience are the clearest and most complete), will, I think,
at least, convince us of its reasonableness in certain large classes of errors of observations, Now if we attend to what has taken place in the history of astronomical observation, we
find that the gross errors of the earlier observers proceeded mainly from three or four
principal causes—for instance, refraction, imperfect measurement of time, and the use
of the naked eye in pointing to objects. When these fery capital occasions of error were
removed (at least approximately), refraction being discovered and allowed for, and the
pendulum and telescopic sights introduced, it was found that observations at once
attained a high order of accuracy, showing that the principal sources of error had been
eliminated, It would seem, in fact, that in coarse and rude observations the errors
proceed from « very few principal causes; and in this case, consequently, our hypothesis
will probably represent the facts only imperfectly, and the frequency of the errors will
only approximate roughly and yaguely to the law which follows from itf. But when

*® The extreme simplicity of the exponential relation itself, whether considered as expressing the law of singlo
errors, or that of the mean results of a large number of observations, as contrasted with the long and difficult
methods by which it was etablished, has naturally led to several attempts to dispense with or simplify the
latter ; in some the hypothesis wo here adopt is taken as a basis ; but, 80 far as the present writer is aware,
every process giyen, except Porss0x's, fails in generality, In a recent Memoir on the Law of Frequeney of
