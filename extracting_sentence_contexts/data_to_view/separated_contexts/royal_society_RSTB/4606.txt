The latter extension he regards as the equivalent of the Echidna-pterygoid, the
ascending part as the homologue of the mammalian alisphenoid bone. This view,
it is to be noted, is not in accord with Gaupr’s contention that the Echidna-pterygoid
represents the reptilian pterygoid, a matter discussed on p. 265 of the present paper. Whatever be the origin and morphological value of the ala temporalis, there can
be little doubt that the processus alaris is a derivative of the trabecular skeleton,
and is, in fact, a lateral outgrowth of the basisphenoid cartilage. In Mystacocetes
the boundary line between the ala temporalis and the processus alaris persists for
a long time after ossification is well advanced ; it is clearly marked in the 3-feet
11-inch foetus of Balenoptera borealis (Skull R), but has practically disappeared
in the 6-feet 4-inch foetus of Balanoptera musculus (Skull 8). The tract of cartilage seen in fig. 4 to the external side of the hinder part of the
the ala temporalis of the Mammal as the homologue of the processus basipterygoideus of the Reptile
(pp. 542, 585), the epipterygoid (antipterygoid) being wanting in Mammals (p. 546),
