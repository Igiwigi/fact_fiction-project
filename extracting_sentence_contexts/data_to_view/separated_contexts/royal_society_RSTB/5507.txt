For example, one reads ** that characters have arisen at
variance with the innate tendencies of ‘ Heredity,’ and persisted without the aid of
* Natural Selection’? (KYLE, 1926, p. vii), or that evolution is predetermined and in
the unfolding of characters “ selection” plays no part (BrerG, 1926). Again, NoBLE
and JAECKLE (1928) remark as follows: “ Many other so-called highly adaptive struc-
tures in the Amphibia are as fortuitous in their occurrence as the large digital discs. Adaptation in these cases is a chance relationship, not a progressive modification towards
particular habitat requirements.’ In fact, there is a strong trend of feeling at the
present day that evolution is not coherent, but is fortuitous, and such conclusions are
based on assumptions such as the following: ‘“ In whatever direction we look, in the
coastal region or in fresh water, we find many diverse forms living under precisely the
same conditions, yet with quite different shapes and structures (KYLE, 1926, p. 250),
and according to some others, animals possessing similar adaptive modifications are

found living under widely different conditions. Undoubtedly different forms of animals
are found living in the same place within a few feet of one another, but have the
gradations in the environment been studied so thoroughly that there is justification
for saying that these different animals are “‘ living under precisely the same conditions ”
and that they do not occupy definite “ niches” in the environment ? Again, has the
modification of a structure been correlated with one or more factors in the environment,
and has it been established that the same factors do not influence life in another
environment where the same modification is found?
