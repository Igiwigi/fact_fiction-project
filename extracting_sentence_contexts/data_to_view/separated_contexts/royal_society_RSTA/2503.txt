It has, therefore, been proposed that the atomic structure is disordered. One popular idea is that the apparent cubic crystal structure emerges as an average of small
domains of a lower-symmetry structure. Analysis from measurement and calculation of the pair
distribution function has shown that in fact a domain model is inappropriate [29], and that instead
the apparent disorder in the atomic structure emerges from the superposition of many RUMs with
different wave vectors [26,27]. These RUMs have relatively high amplitude owing to their low


frequency: the square of the amplitude is proportional to the T/#*, where T is the temperature
and w is the angular frequency of the phonon. This situation is actually quite different from
the case of disorder in a spin model.
