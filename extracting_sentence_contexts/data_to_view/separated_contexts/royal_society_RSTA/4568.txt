The errors in the mean, standard deviation and skewness are very small. The
errors in both mean and modal frequencies are small, but the error in the modal
frequency is considerably smaller than that in the mean frequency. This follows
from the fact that the frequency curve is horizontal at the mode, but slopes at the
mean, and accordingly any bodily shift of the curve produces far more effect on the
mean than on the modal frequency.

(b.) The errors in p and y are large in some cases very large. The question then
arises how is it possible to determine the frequency curve correctly.
