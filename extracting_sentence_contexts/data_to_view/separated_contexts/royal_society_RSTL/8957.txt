Chenueal stimulation.—Dilute spirit, or other irritant, when dropped on the
<- paralyzed swimming-organ of Aurelia aurita, often gives rise to a whole series of
ie rhythmical pulsations, the systoles and diastoles following one another at about the
[= same rate as is obseryable in the normal swimming-motions of the unmutilated
-2 animal. E d 3. Thermal 8timulation.—lIt is somewhat difficult, in the case of paralyzed swim-
> ming-organs, to prove the occurrence of a contraction in response to thermal stimula-
= tion, from the fact that while these tissnes are not nearly 80 sensitive to this mode of
= excitation as might be anticipated, they are, as observed in my former paper, extraor-
Z dinarily sensitive to mechanical excitation. It therefore becomes difficult to administer
Z the appropriate thermal stimulus without at the same time causing a sufficient mecha-
ke nical disturbance to render it doubtful to which of the stimuli the response is due. Y 'This may be done, however, by allowing a few drops of heated sea-water to run over
= the excitable snrface while it is exposed to the air.
