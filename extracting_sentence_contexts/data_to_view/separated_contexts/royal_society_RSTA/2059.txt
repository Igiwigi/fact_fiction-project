BRITISH ISLES FOR THE EPOCH JANUARY 1, 1915. 29

I ought to mention that in the solution adopted the mean longitude differs by
0"3 from the mean for the districts. This really arose from the fact that after a large
amount of reduction had been done the longitude of Worthing was found to have
been entered with the wrong sign. The values for District VIII. had to be re-com-
puted, but the net result for the British Isles was as stated above. The change in no
case amounts to ly except by the turn of the decimal point, so that the original
solution has been retained.
