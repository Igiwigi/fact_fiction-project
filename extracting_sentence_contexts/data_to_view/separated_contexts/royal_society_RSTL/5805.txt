S As the organ upon which always, in some part or other of the body of the Annelid,
Ethe office of reproduction devolves, is frequently in other parts diverted to other pur-
& poses, and modified in outward characters, it will prevent circuitousness of expression if
Zat the outset a name be adopted, under which, whatever its place, size or form, this
= organ may be generically distinguished.

at the date of its publication, July 23, 1856. © The genitalia of the typical Annelida
are excessively simple in their structure ; indeed, special reproductive organs can hardly

* This is an unobjectionable title; it implies no theory, it simply states the fact that the organ is repeated
more or less regularly in the segments of the body. No other organ in the body of the Annelid is © 8eg-
mental ;” every other organ is continuous throughout the body. 'This is the case with the alimentary, the
nervous and the vascular systems. The feet are not © organs.” Indeed, 80 intimate in an anatomical 56n8e
is the relation between the segmental organ and the foot, that in the development of the embryo Annelid
they constitute one system.
