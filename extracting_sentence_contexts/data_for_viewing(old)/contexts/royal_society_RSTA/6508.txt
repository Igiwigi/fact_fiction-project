time fy, one will obtain a predicted value, as is well confirmed by experiment. One can, however,
always perform a complementary measurement, that of p (the momentum), which will leave
any value predicted by using Q undetermined by the uncertainty relations, which in principle
preclude associating a physical reality corresponding to a coordinate q when one measures p [1]
(pp. 210-212). In classical physics, this difficulty does not arise because one can always define
both variables simultaneously as referring to an independent reality. In any quantum experiment
one deals with a system containing an object and an instrument that interferes in the ultimate
reality responsible for the phenomenon observed and thus makes it different from the object
considered, whether such it is assumed to be defined independently or only at the time of
observation.

7It is impossible to ascertain that an apparently random sequence of events is in fact random, rather than connected by
some classical causal law, and there is no mathematical proof that any ‘random’ sequence is in fact random. The sequences
of indeterminate events that allow for probabilistic predictions concerning them is a different matter, although there is
no guarantee that any such sequence is not ultimately underlain by classically causal connections in the case of quantum
phenomena. As explained, experimentally quantum phenomena only preclude determinism.


3. Causality as probability: quantum causality and the arrow of events

Bohr’s final account of his interpretation in his 1958 article ‘Causality and Complementarity’ [6] (v.
3, pp. 1-7), also contains, for the first time in his work, a view of causality applicable in quantum
physics, as opposed to classical causality, to which Bohr had referred by ‘causality’ previously.
According to Bohr:
