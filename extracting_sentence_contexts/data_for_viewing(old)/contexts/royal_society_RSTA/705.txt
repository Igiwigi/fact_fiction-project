2-level atoms were “created” by light beams. I/we have results we cannot explain at the moment.
If you can explain them your name can immediately go on a paper.’ In fact, this was easy for me
to do, because I had spent some considerable time working on multi-photon absorption and was
able to recognize the signature of two-photon absorption. I wrote a theoretical background to the
problem and showed how well the data fitted theory. I was a quantum optics researcher again
and the results were immediately publishable [2].

Woerdman and his co-workers had several projects in train and I was welcome to involve
myself in any, or all, of them. One project which figured was on the possible existence of orbital
angular momentum in a light beam. I have often been asked ‘How does one think of an original
idea in physics research? Who did what?’ I do not really know the answer to the question except
to say the route is clear in this case. Allen, Beijersbergen, Spreeuw and Woerdman published a
paper in June 1992 [1] which made the problem clear and offered an understanding of the ways
