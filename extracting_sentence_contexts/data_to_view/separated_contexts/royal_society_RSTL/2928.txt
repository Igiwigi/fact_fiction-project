The case here is ex-
actly analogous to the vision of two inclined lines (fig. 10.) when each is presented
to a different eye in the stereoscope. It is curious, that an effect like this, which
mnust have heen seen thousands of times, should never have attracted sufficient at-
tention to have been made the snbject of philosophic observation. It was one of the
earliest facts which drew my attention to the subject I am now treating. Dr. Surea+ was very much puzzled by an effect of binocular perspective which he
observed, but was unable to explain.
