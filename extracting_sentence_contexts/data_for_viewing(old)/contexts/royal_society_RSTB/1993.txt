Apogamy and apospory are the most important phenomena which come under
this head. The former is known only in Leptosporangiate Ferns, the latter in the
Mosses as well. Though conveniently considered together it does not follow that
the evidential weight to be attached to them is equal. Both are commonly regarded
as indicating that the distinction between the two generations is not a rigid one.
Beyond this, which is indeed nothing more than a statement of the facts, widely
divergent opinions have been expressed. The explanation which may be given on
the theory of homologous alternation may be first considered, since the views held by
authors who have written from the standpoint of the antithetie theory are rather
critical than constructive.

It is unnecessary to add anything further regarding the possible significance of
the facts of induced apogamy, with which instances of direct apogamy have been
connected by intermediate forms, on the theory of homologous alternation. On the
view that the sporophyte is descended from a similar form to the gametophyte, a
comparison of apospory with gametophytic budding suggests itself. The position of
the aposporous growths may similarly be related to the capacity of the cells of the
part for further growth. J'rom this point of view the cases of apospory, in which
prothalli spring from the first leaves of the sporophyte, are of special interest, while
they are those Jeast easily accounted for on any other theory. The existence of
cases of induced apospory in Mosses is important in that it shows that this deviation
from the normal is not confined to one group of plants. By many they are regarded
as affording strong evidence of the homology of the two generations. In view of
a possible explanation which would be satisfactory, whichever theory is correct,
it seems inadvisable to lay stress upon this phenomenon. This will be referred to in
