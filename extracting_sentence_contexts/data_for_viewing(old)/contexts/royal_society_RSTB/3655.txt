The implement B drawn in text-figs. 2 and 3 and in Plate 14, figs. B, B, is the most
shapely of the “eagle-beaks” yet discovered. Advantage has been taken (as is so
often the case in the most ancient flint implements) of the natural shape of a flint
nodule. In this case it was fairly triangular. The workman had only to trim one
side and a portion of the other, and to chip out the characteristic curved keel—and
then remove a small bit of the anterior lower surface (fig. 3, X), This implement
was found in a stone-heap in a Crag-pit at Foxhall and is probably derived from Mid-
Glacial sands overlying the Red Crag—a provenance which is certain with regard to
specimen © and is also in the highest degree probable in the case of specimen A.
These implements—specimens A, B, and C—are accordingly to be regarded apart
from those obtained from the Sub-Crag bone-bed. They are from a later horizon,
which is nevertheless a very ancient one, older than any of our river-gravels. It is a
very remarkable fact that they are of the hitherto unknown “ rostro-carinate” form
characteristic of the Sub-Crag bed, though more highly finished than the latter and

occurring in the same locality.

Last August, I showed this implement to Sir ArrHur Evans, F.R.S., who was
set thinking by it; and, after a few minutes’ search, produced from the collection
of his father (the late Sir Joun Evans, F.R.S.), of which he is now the possessor,
the remarkable implement represented in the text-figs. 4 and 5, and in Plate 14,
figs. A, A. It is the only flint implement of this type which was known to Sir John,
and I have been unable to discover that any others resembling the rostro-carinate
