Along bones to the estimate of the stature of the gorilla is noticeable also, if to a

lesser degree, in the cases of the chimpanze and orang. We may sum up our

results as follows :—

(a.) Man is apparently differentiated from the chimpanze and orang by direct
selection of stature, but this direct selection appears to be small in the case of the
gorilla.

* If the chimpanze and orang be treated as “‘ dwarf men,” and their statures estimated in the manner
indicated on p. 224 below, the femur and tibia give statures, F, 115-5, 105-0; T, 118°0, 112°5 respectively,
nearer the actual values, in fact too small, but the radius and humerus still give values far too great.

The stature of the gorilla as estimated from femur and tibia in this manner now becomes far too small.

(b.) Man and the gorilla appear to have followed common lines of differentiation
from a common stock in the case of the femur and tibia, but the differentiation on
which they have not followed common lines has not been that of radius and humerus
alone, or (k) would have given good results.
