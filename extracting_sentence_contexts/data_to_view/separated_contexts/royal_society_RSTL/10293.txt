Tt is very
hardy, bears drought well, is not very particular as to soil, but is stated to be variable
on different soils, &. At Rothamsted the variety which occurs is that called
vulgaris in HookER's © Student's Flora,” and it is pretty constant in its characteristics. The conditions propitious to ib are : its powerful root-stock, with extensive storage
of nutritive matter, deep range, and power of availing itself of the food and moisture
in the lower layers of the oil ; the fact that the seeds are rarely produced before the
first cutting, thus obviating exhaustion, and tending to prolong the life of the indi-
vidual; its hardy constibution, as shown by its wide geographical distribution, its
relative indifference to the nature of the soil, climate, &c. For its predominance see the snbjoined table.
