Trorem (Schreier 1927). Every element pe P is represented by one and only one normal word
we. (2:4)

Proof. We have already seen that every fe P is represented by at least one normal word;
it only remains to show that / cannot be represented by more than one normal word. Ifnow
« — pd, then p is represented by w = woo, where again w) = 1€QB. Let w'eWW be another
normal word which represents the same element /, and let w’ = wya’—such a o’ exists
because of the transitivity of ; finally, let p’ be the original of o’ under ¢, so that a’ = p'¢;
then w’ represents p’, and thus p’ = p, 7’ = ¢ and w’ = w. This proves the theorem.

The uniquely determined normal word representing / we call the normal form of p.
Because of the theorem we may identify the elements of / with their normal forms. Then
¥ becomes a group of permutations of the elements of P; in fact, the elements of © are just
the right multiplications of P; with fixed ¢ = q¢ and for all pe P one has

po = pq.
Y is called the regular permutation representation of P. It is well known that right multi-

plications and the regular permutation representation can be defined in the same way for
arbitrary groups, not only for free products with an amalgamated subgroup.

3. Computation of the normal form; uniqueness of the length

The normal form of an element /¢ P can be computed without difficulty. Let the element
be given in the form
