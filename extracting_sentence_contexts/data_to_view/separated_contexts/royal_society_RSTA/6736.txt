One therefore wonders whether the solutions are in fact identical, as they would certainly
be if the system were finite. We have shown elsewhere (D, theorems 6 to 8) that the problem
has in fact a unique solution in a wide range of cases. For analytical processes, non-unique-
ness can occur only when

We shall prove in the next section that the solutions F(t) and G(/) do in fact differ for

a certain range of the parameters. VoL, 246. A.
