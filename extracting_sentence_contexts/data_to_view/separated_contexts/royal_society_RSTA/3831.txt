Some compared it to
the discharge of an enormous gun, except that it was continuous and not intermittent,
and we were reminded that among the Caribs there were old traditions regarding the
“Great Gun of the Soufriére.” Most people described it, however, as having a long,
drawn-out, weird, unearthly character, recalling the roar of a wounded animal in
intense pain. It is a curious fact that most observers in St. Vincent state that it did
not seem to them to be made up of distinct detonations or reports, or if so, these were
so numerous as to be blended together without intermission. The sound, however,
rose and fell, being at times distinctly much louder than at others. At the same
time in Barbados, St. Lucia, Trinidad and elsewhere, the noises from the voleano were
compared to the reports of distant cannonading, and the intermittent nature of the
sound was one of its distinctive features.
