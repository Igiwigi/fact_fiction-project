character for the Cyatheacez.

I have examined mature sporangia of Alsophila australis, excelsa, plagiopteris, and
radens ; also of Hemitelia capensis and of Cyathea sinuata, and Brunonis, species
for the most part mentioned by Bommer as showing this inconstancy of position of
the annulus. In all cases the annulus is continuous across the stalk ; it is thus a
complete ring, and is therefore essentially oblique ; but though this structure of the
sporangium is constant, the form may vary considerably, and the position of the
annulus be apparently altered, though its structural relations may still be really
constant; the sporangia are subject to changes of form owing to pressure, just as figs
when pressed into a box, but the structure of the sporangium does not appear to be
fundamentally altered, any more than that of the fig. I do not, therefore, admit
Bommer’s conclusion from this series of facts, that the position of the annulus in the
Cyatheaceze is determined by pressure.

Nor do I think that pressure upon the developing sporangium can be held to be
the determining cause in other cases. The following facts bear on the question :—
In the Osmundacew, and especially in Todea barbara, the young sporangia are
pressed together in the still circinate leaf, so that they assume most irregular shapes ;
the apex may be flattened, and the sides may be squeezed and thrown into three,
four or five angles; but when mature, the sporangia show in their structure no trace
of these irregular early pressures. The same is the case also in Thyrsopteris. Con-
versely, in Gleichenia the sporangia stand quite aloof and free in their young state,
and are uniformly oval in form ; there is no sign of external or mutual pressure when
young, yet they develop a uniformly oblique annulus. This shows that in Gleichenia
