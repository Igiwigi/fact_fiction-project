During most of the observations care was taken to dive sufficiently deep to
avoid any serious errors. It was found that, using the graphical method of averaging out the
fluctuations, the self-consistency of the eight determinations of the coincidence interval
(approximately 200 sec.) gave a probable error of only +0-015 sec. This indicates that the
period of one of the fictitious pendulums could be measured to within +-2 x 107â€™ sec. The
estimated accuracy of the other corrections is as follows:

(i) Temperature as for base station: +2 x 1077 sec.

(ii) Density.
