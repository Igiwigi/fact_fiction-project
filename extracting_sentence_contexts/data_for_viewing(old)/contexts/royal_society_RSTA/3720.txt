6. Conclusion

The goal of the study of a one-dimensional chain with cohesive/brittle elements was to reveal the
complexity of the metastable patterns in the brittleâ€”elastic systems and to elucidate the origin
of the locking phenomenon. The patterning in this model can be understood in terms of the
competition between incommensurate interactions. The non-convexity of the elastic energy of
brittle springs drives the system towards strain localization, while the elastic background with
convex energy favours homogeneity. In the absence of an internal length scale, this competition
leads to the formation of an infinite number of infinitesimal cracks. The discreteness of the
problem supplies the length scale responsible for the finite scale of the microstructures.

The striking structural stability of the commensurate microstructures in this model is
manifested by the fact that, even in the continuum limit, the infinitesimal parameter variation
does not affect their robust topological structure. Such locking was observed in experiments on
self-assembly of micropillars in drying systems [4] but has not been previously rationalized at
the conceptual level [14]. Robustness of this type can play an important role in stress-induced
developmental morphogenesis, ensuring, for instance, that the number of fingers or vertebra is
largely independent of the variation of external parameters [9].

The insights provided by the study of this conceptual model have to be corroborated by
two- and three-dimensional models aimed at reproducing realistic geometries and capturing
the specificity of elastic and cohesive interactions. Furthermore, our static analysis should be
supplemented by the study of dynamics, allowing one to distinguish between different paths
in the rugged energy landscapes characterizing this type of systems. Finally, it will be important
to show the limited sensitivity of the predicted locking patterns to the randomness of the breaking
