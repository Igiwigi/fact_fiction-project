sign of the anaphylactic nature of a reaction. Such delay is seen in the blood of
guinea-pigs dying from anaphylactic shock, or from injections of any of the three
anaphylatoxins. The delay is variable and never very great ; a normal coagulation-
time of 3-5 minutes at room temperature may be lengthened to 10 minutes or

rather more, but we have never observed in the guinea-pig the practically permanent
loss of coagulability which the anaphylactic reaction produces in the dog’s blood. In
this respect, however, there is no obvious discrepancy between the effects of the
anaphylatoxins and the true anaphylactic reaction in the guinea-pig. We have
already mentioned the fact that the serum digested with chloroform has a very
different effect, causing widespread intravascular clotting.

Leucocytes.—A leucopenia, affecting chiefly the polymorphonuclear cells, is
seen in guinea-pigs killed with any of the anaphylatoxins, as in those dying
of the true anaphylactic shock. There does not seem to be any great significance,
however, in this correspondence, since a quite similar leucopenia is seen in the
blood of guinea-pigs killed with histamine, and probably with many other
poisons.

Platelets.—The effect on the blood-platelets is much more important, in that it
shows a definite discrepancy between the effects of the anaphylatoxins and those of
the specific antigen acting on the anaphylactic animal. For observation of the
