As for this
latter point I had occasion to make observations on the influence of the parental age
on the mortality of children. The results which I obtained in this enquiry seem to
advocate deferring the time of marrying one year beyond the limits mentioned
before. *

Let us finally enquire in what degree the observed facts correspond with the conse-
quences deduced from the statistics of the age differences. We find in our table of
natality the following figures for the couples between the quoted limits of age and for
the children born in those families in four years :—

Father 24-25 and mother 18, 19, or 20 . . . . . 87 families with 148 births,
