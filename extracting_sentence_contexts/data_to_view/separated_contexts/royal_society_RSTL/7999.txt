we see the floor of the mouth, with the rudi-
mentary tongue (79.); and behind the arches, only five of which could be clearly seen,
we have the large yelk-mass (y.) with its emarginate front outline. Expecting to find
the earliest condition of the © trabeculee ” (first pair of rods) in the ammocetine condition
(that is, continuous with the © investing mass ”), these sections cost me much thought,
and these obseryations were repeated again and again. The fact is that the /ast of the
arches comes nearest to the inyesting mass, and not the firs, and it is wholly distinct
from the axial structures,

Thus we see that © the branchial arches have the same morphological value as the
hyoid, and the latter as the mandibular arc ” (HvxLzy, © Croonian Lecture,” p. 53); and
not only 80, but the © trabecule cranii” are merely the foremost of these arches, as
both of us have for some time felt satisfied. In the earliest condition of my * first stage ” (fig. 7), although these thick rods gra-
dually decrease in size from before backwards, yet the first are twice as thick as the

second, and their section is most perfectly ovoidal. In the rest the shape in section is
round within and flattigh on the outside; this arises from the fact that dehiscence
commences on the inner side several days before the clefts appear in the cutaneous
system ; yet thus early the cheeks are becoming forrowed (figs. 6 & 7) between the
arches,

The incurved lower end of the arches stops short some distance from the mid line,
leaving a space for the azygous pieces, which, however, do not appear for seyeral days to
come.
