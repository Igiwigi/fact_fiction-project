The energy
F,0£, is available for conversion into kinetic energy or dissipation by some process not
considered in the elastic theory. Tt will be seen from the foregoing that a singularity with a prescribed /7 on and outside
= can be regarded as arising from either (i) a suitable distribution of S,, within ¥ or (ii) a dis-
tribution of body forces f° within &. The /;5 are equal to the fictitious forces (36) associated
with §,,. /, is the same for (i) and (ii). The representation (ii) fits into normal elastic theory
where surface and body forces are regarded as the sources of the stress field. On the other
hand (i) is a more natural representation of the singularities of physical theory, since they
do not in fact arise from body forces.
