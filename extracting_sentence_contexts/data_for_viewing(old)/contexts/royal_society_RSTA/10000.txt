7. A Comparison of the Negative Leak in Hydrogen with the Positive Leak
in Oxygen.

The positive leak in oxygen has been studied very fully by Professor O. W. RicHARDSON
(‘ Phil. Trans.,’ A, 413, 1906), who attributes it to the presence of oxygen in the
surface layer of the wire, and this view is undoubtedly in accordance with the facts.
I attribute the negative leak in hydrogen in the same way to the presence of hydrogen
in the surface layer of the platinum, If this view is correct, the behaviour of the
positive leak in oxygen might be expected to be closely analogous to the behaviour of
the negative leak in hydrogen, As a matter of fact, there is an extremely close
analogy between the two, as will be shown presently.

In my previous paper I showed that treating a wire with nitric acid and heating it
in air diminished the negative leak to a value very small compared with that usually
obtained on heating a wire in a vacuum, This diminution was explained as being
due to the removal of traces of hydrogen or othér substances from the wire, and I
suggested that possibly a complete removal of such traces would entirely destroy the
negative leak. Since then RicHarpson (loc. cit.) has described an experiment in
which the leak from a platinum tube in air at atmospheric pressure was measured
while hydrogen was allowed to diffuse through the platinum from the inside of the
tube out into the air. He found that the small negative leak was unchanged by the
hydrogen. I have repeated this experiment and confirmed his result. As RicHarDsoN
