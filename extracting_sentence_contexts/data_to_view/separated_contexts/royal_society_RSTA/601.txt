By (8), the velocity gradient is infinite and
perpendicular to the minus Mach lines. On one side (we shall call this side IL) of the minus Mach line DAC the parameter h,
vanishes at A; for definiteness let h,>0 on DA, and h,<0 on AC. Since hy is discontinuous
across DAC, h,--0 on the other side (side I) at A, and, by lemma 1, we may take C and D
sufficiently close to A so that h,+0 between C and D on side I. Let us assume that h,>0 on

side I of the Mach line DAC; it will appear immediately that 4; must, in fact, in the case
shown in figure 7, have the same sign on side I as on side II of the segment DA. It
follows from (5), (10) and (8) that the curvatures of the plus Mach lines and streamlines,
respectively, and the component in the plus Mach direction of the velocity gradient are dis-
continuous across the Mach-line segment DA; they are finite on both sides, and none of them
changes sign. ‘Across’* the segment AC they are all discontinuous; they are finite on both
sides, and change sign.
