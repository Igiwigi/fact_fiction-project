The variables of the problem are thus more numerous,
"g and the energy-function leads to more equations connecting them.

& 957. We might now attempt to proceed, by including the mechanical energy of the
material conductors in the same function as the electro-kinetic energy, thus deducing
@ that the energy gained by altering the co-ordinate ¢, is (dT'/d¢,) 5¢,, in other words
that the displacement 8¢, is opposed by a force equal to dT/d¢,. This would make
currents flowing in the same direction along parallel wires repel each other, and in fact
generally the force thus indicated is just the opposite to the reality. The expression T represents completely the energy of the system so far as electro-
_ Motive disturbances are concerned, as has been proved above.
