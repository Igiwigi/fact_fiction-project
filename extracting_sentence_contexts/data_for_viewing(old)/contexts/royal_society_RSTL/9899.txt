residue, we have firs to consider whether the whole of the potass of the crop was
derived from that which was artificially snpplied, or whether only 80 much of it as was
in excess of that taken up without manure ?


EXPERIMENTS ON THE MIXED HERBAGE OF PERMANENT MEADOW. 319

Tf we assume, for the sake of illustration, that the potass artificially 8npplied was the
mos readily available, and that the crop relied entirely upon it 80 long as it lasted,
the result would be that only about 376 of the 900 lbs. applied, remained as residue
after the first 8ix years, and that nearly the whole of this was taken out during the
next even years. That ib was nob all recovered by that timie would appear from the
fact that in every one of the following seven years there was till considerably more
potass in the crop of plot 8 than in that without manure.

If, on the other hand, we suppose that the s0il yielded up as much potass from its
own stores to the crop of plob 8 as to that without manure, there would remain at the
end of the ix years of the application 567 1bs., or nearly two-thirds of the whole
supplied till to be accounted for. On the same supposition, at the end of the next 14
years there would still remain more than 300 Ibs. of the 8upplied potass as yet
unaccounted for. That some did, and does still, remain in an available condition may
be concluded from the fact that there was a considerable excess of produce, of mineral
matter, and of potass, removed from plot 8 compared with plot 3 in the two succeeding
years, 1876 and 1877, and there was again an excess of produce in 1878.
