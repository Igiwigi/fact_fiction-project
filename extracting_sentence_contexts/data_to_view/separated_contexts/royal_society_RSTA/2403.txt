Each FP in (2.12) can now be
solved and any conditional PDF Q)); can be constructed. We show in detail the FP for P; and P2,
and their analytical solutions.

Performing the derivation found in appendix B, we obtain the Fokker—Planck equations for
P1(x, t|xo,0) and P2(x, t,x’, '|x9,0), with t > t’, given by

The simple form of equations (4.2) allows us to gain physical intuition about the process they in
describe. In each equation, the first term represents the deterministic, or mean rate of movement : =
for the variable x, which in fact corresponds to the derivative of the mean of the DLE (3.3). The : 3

role of this first term, taken as a force resulting from a potential proportional to x, is to drive
the solution away from the initial preparation of the system, i.e. with x localized at xo, towards
x=0. To understand how the dynamics are affected by this first term it suffices to consider the
evolution of P;, or P3, in the absence of diffusion, i.e. o = 0, and zero history ¥(t) = 0.
