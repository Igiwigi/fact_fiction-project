In this set of 20 pairs of values
the correlation is actually — 0-629, a value which would only be exceeded by wncorre-
lated variates in 3 samples of 20 out of athousand. The particular meteorological variate.
autumn rainfall, was picked out of a table giving at least 36 meteorological quantities.
and the chance that all of these, if independent and in reality uncorrelated with the crop,
should give correlations between + 0-629, was therefore about 0-89. Such a system
would therefore be expected to yield so high a correlation only once in 9 trials, and the
fact that such a correlation occurred supplied some presumption that autumn rainfall
had in reality a perceptible influence on the crop. In discussing the significance of this result SHaw (14, pp. 318-319) made the inter-
esting suggestion that the association observed might not be due wholly to the effects
of autumn weather, but possibly to dry autumns being frequently followed by a favourable
succession of weather in Spring and Summer.

“ He would like to say a word with respect of Mr. THomas’s suggestion that the
autumn rainfall was not the dominant factor in determining the subsequent yield
of wheat.
