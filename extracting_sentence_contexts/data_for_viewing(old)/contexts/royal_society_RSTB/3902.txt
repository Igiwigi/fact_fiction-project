EXCITATORY PROCESS IN THE DOG'S HEART. 383

pair of electrodes is arranged radially to the S—A node, the chief deflection, by which
we mean the first prominent and sharp deflection, is always upright in the curve }
that is to say, at the time when this chief deflection is recorded, the proximal
contact is always negative relative to the distal one; and this statement is true
however far the contacts lie from the suleus. The prominence of this chief deflection
and its uniform direction aroused our curiosity and suggested further experiment.
We have, we think, clear evidence that it is this deflection which indicates the
arrival of the excitatory process at the point investigated. That the excitatory
process in the auricle is first signalled by relative negativity of the tissue in which it
first appears, is proved, if proof is still required, by the fact that leads from the
region which jirst shows electrical disturbance, i.e. the region of the S-A node,
invariably shows initial negativity. The excitatory process is accompanied by
a considerable discharge, as shown by the amplitude (1°5-6 millivolts) of the chief
excursion in the same leads.* A similar discharge is to be anticipated when the
excitatory process reaches outside leads. Now the only deflection which, read as an
expression of voltage,t is comparable in outlying leads to that of S.A.N. leads is the
chief deflection. Its amplitude and sharpness give first hints of its origin.

S.A.N. Lead in 17 Animals—
(a) Prominent upward spike followed by short downward phase in 11 instances (fig. 9a).
(+) Prominent upward spike followed by almost equally prominent downward phase in 5 instances.
(c) Prominent upward deflection followed by several diminutive deflections in 1 instance.
