TO MONTSERRAT, B.W.I. 9

For the complete determination of the horizontal movement at any station it is
necessary to make observations in two directions at right angles. The preliminary
results suggested, however, that in the majority of the earthquakes with which we
were dealing, the ‘‘amplitudes” of the two components of the earth movement, as
recorded on two instruments mounted in the same room on two walls at right angles,
were very nearly equal. This result might have been fortuitous and due to the fact
that in these instances the shocks were originating at a point or points of which the
bearing from the station was roughly equally inclined to the two walls. This question
should have been examined by more extended observations, but the month of May was
approaching and this month had in the previous 2 years seen a marked increase in
the number of tremors. It was therefore considered to be more important to distribute
the instruments at various points throughout the island.
