& All involve the configuration with the deepest /-orbital. Now for such a configuration
the separation of the singlet and triplet terms is a considerable fraction of the term value of
their centre of gravity.} In view of this evidence of large exchange forces the series are
clearly not altogether suitable for treatment by the Coulomb approximation; further, Zn 1,
Sri and Cdr are rather heavy systems. But there is no observational data for more ideal
cases. Table 12 compares the values of o? given by the theory with those obtained by
measurementâ€”those latter are given in arbitrary units, chosen so that the product of the
figures in each series is about equal to the product of the corresponding theoretical figures.
The agreement between the two sets of data is remarkably good in spite of the fact that in
most cases a high degree of cancellation occurs in the transition integrals so that the values

of o? are sensitive to the precise form of the wave functions. The /-d transitions in Sri are
the only ones for which any serious difference appears. In the original paper giving the
experimental results it was mentioned that these transitions seemed abnormal, in that the
apparent ratio of the strength of the first line of the series to that of the second is much greater
than the corresponding ratio for the other similar atoms.{ This suggests that if the dis-
