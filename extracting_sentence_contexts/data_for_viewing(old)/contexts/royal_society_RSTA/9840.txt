has already been described and illustrated for the 8 constituent of the eutectic.

Fig. 16 (x 150) shows the micro-structure of alloy No. 90, containing 89°85 per
cent. of zinc, as it appears when the alloy is cooled from fusion in the furnace in about
45 minutes. The photograph shows a larger proportion of the 8 meteral than that
seen in fig. 14 embedded in eutectic, but the edges of the 8 masses show rims of a
changed material arising from the reaction indicated by the line IJK of the diagram,
The existence of these rims proves that this reaction is rather slow, and the facility
with which it can be inhibited by quenching further confirms this view.

In fig. 17 (x 150) we see the micro-structure of alloy No. 86 (85°52 per cent. zinc)
cooled rather more slowly than the specimen represented in fig. 16. This specimen
(fig. 17) has, in fact, been cooled at the rate adopted for the observation of cooling-
curves. The proportion of @ is larger than in fig. 16, but the change which resulted
in the formation of “rims” in fig. 16 has here taken place to a much larger extent,
so that the original 8 body has almost entirely disappeared. Under the magnification
of fig. 17 (150 diameters) the resulting structure of the “changed” 8 is not very
evident, but a portion of the same specimen is shown in fig. 18 (Plate 5) under a
magnification of 500 diameters, and there the uniformly dark £ is seen to have
become broken up into a laminated structure closely resembling the pearlite seen in
steel. On account of this resemblance, the authors propose to describe this structure
as “pearlitic”; it will, however, be seen that in this case the duplex structure arises
from the decomposition of a compound and not, as in the case of pearlite, from the
decomposition of a solid solution.
