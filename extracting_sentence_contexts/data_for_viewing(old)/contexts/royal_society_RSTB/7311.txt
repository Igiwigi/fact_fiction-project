(a) the geometrical hypothesis;

(6) the diffraction-threshold hypothesis.

For perception to take place, according to the first hypothesis, the geometrical image of an
object formed on the retina must not have a fineness of detail which exceeds the diameter
of the retinal receptors. For perception to take place according to the second hypothesis,
the diffraction pattern of an object formed on the retina must not exhibit differences
of intensity which are below the threshold of difference perception of the retinal
receptors.

The early workers on visual acuity assumed that the retinal image was produced accord-
ing to the rules of geometrical optics. This assumption was apparently justified by the fact
that the visual limits found for the test objects, which were employed at that time, fitted in
with the hypothesis that between two stimulated retinal receptors there was a third receptor
which did not receive stimulation. Thus the angular separation of two neighbouring stars,
which just permitted them to be appreciated as two by the unaided eye, was very nearly
equal to the angular separation of two photoreceptors which have an intervening receptor
between them. In the case of Landoltâ€™s broken C test, the same reasoning applied when the
C itself was white on a black background. When, on the contrary, the C was black and it
lay on a white background, the opposite reasoning seemed to apply, namely, that the
images of the ends of the C, on either side of the break, protected the photoreceptors from
stimulation; but that between these two, there was a third which was stimulated by the
light which was coming through the break.
