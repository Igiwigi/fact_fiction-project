They are :—

(1) “That Cretaceous Asteroidea belong only exceptionally to modern genera. The
fauna is Mesozoic and has no general relationship with the Tertiary forms.” The fact
that fairly complete lineages of Cretaceous Polyzoa, when followed up, lead to such
massively elaborated forms that further evolution (without resorption of the skeleton)
is hard to imagine, has already forced me to the same conclusion. (2) “That the starfish may be separated into lineages (‘species series’) which
preserve unbroken continuity during their life-history.” This, in Cretaceous Polyzoa,
is the theme of the present paper.
