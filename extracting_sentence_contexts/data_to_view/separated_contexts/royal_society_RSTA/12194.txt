Vapour-pressures. The pressures of the vapour were read from experiments with a larger quantity of
water in the tube, as well as when the quantity was small ; but uniform results were
not obtained. The vapour-pressure of water, unlike that of other liquids, depends to
some extent on the amount of substance present.* This is to be attributed to the
fact, that with only a small amount of liquid present, a relatively large surface of the
tube is exposed to the vapour, and, as there can be no doubt that the vapour adheres
to the surface, the pressure is lowered to a certain extent. The results, with the
larger quantity, are therefore given as probably more correct. Each pressure is the
mean of some seven or eight readings in which the relative volumes of water and
steam were altered within the greatest limits which the tube allowed,

The pressures are, as before stated, corrected for deviations from Boy Leâ€™s law.
