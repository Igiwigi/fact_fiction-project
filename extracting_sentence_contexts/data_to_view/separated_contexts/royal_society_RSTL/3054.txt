A far more striking
case, however, is presented by that vyery influential body sulphuric acid (681.) ; and
probably phosphoric acid also is in the same peculiar relation.

1356. It would seem in the cases of those bodies which suffer no change them-
selves, as sulphuric acid (and perhaps in all), that they affect water in its conducting
power only as an electrolyte; for whether little or much improved, the decomposi-
tion is proportionate to the quantity of electricity passing (727. 730.), and the transfer
is therefore due to electrolytic discharge. This is in accordance with the fact already
stated as regards water (984.), that the conducting power is not improved for
electricity of force below the electrolytic intensity of the substance acting as the di-
electric ; but both facts (and some others) are against the opinion which I formerly
gave, that the power of salts, &c. might depend upon their assumption of the liquid
state by solution in the water employed (410.). It occurs to me that the effect may
perhaps be related to, and have its explanation in differences of specific inductive ca-
Pacities. 1357.
