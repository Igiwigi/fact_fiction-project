If the helix is north of the magnetic axis, it will tend to send the upper end of the
needle south ; if it is south, the upper end will go north. As in the case of the decli-
nation, it is as if the end of the free needle or line of force nearest to it was repelled. In fact every case is included in this result, that if the helix be diamagnetically
adjusted (2975.) for a free needle, whether it is above or below the needle, or on this
side or that, the nearest end of the needle will be as if repelled, provided the helix is
not in a neutral position.

2994. I repeated all these experiments with the helix reversed, $0 as to give the
effect of a paramagnetic globe of air (2865. 2973.). I need only say, that the effects
were precisely the same in nature and order, only in the reverse direction.
