the long bone. But if these curves be plotted once for all, we have a graphical
qeans of at once determining, by simply running the eye along a line, the probable
ature corresponding to any given length of long bone. With care we can find the

robable stature to *5 centim., but as a rule to the nearest centimetre is sufficient.

Es the lines of regression for the normal population are given as part of our curves,

Ris clear that the diagrams attached to this memoir (Plates 3, 4) will also serve for the

Uetermination to a like degree of exactitude of the probable stature of individuals or

¥aces falling within the ordinary range of statures. In view of the fact that the
agrams serve all practical purposes, I have not considered it needful to deduce from

ie above quintics numerical approximations for the value of the stature in terms of

e lengths of the various long bones.

“4 (22.) If the reader will examine the diagrams, he will see the twelve giants
, B, C,... K, L marked by small dots; from these the curves were determined,
d he will notice that they strike fairly well through the groups. The triplet

'B, M, N contains three pseudo-giants, or sub-giants; these as well as the dwarfs,
