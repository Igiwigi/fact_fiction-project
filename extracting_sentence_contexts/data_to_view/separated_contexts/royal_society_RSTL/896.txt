The application of the plumb-line, as already described, is

peculiar to the instruments made by /Mr. Trovcnrox: it
regards the vertical axis rather than any other part, and is,
in fact, exactly analogous to the usual verification of a zenith
Sector. During the period in which I was engaged in making ob-
servations with circular instruments, I was led to consider the
advantages and inconveniences of the usual method of adjust-
ing them ; and it appeared to me, that the essential part of
their construction, which relates to their adjustment, was
capable of being improved. In order to render the nature of the improvement, which I
wish to propose, more intelligible, I ought previously to
remark, that there are, at present in use, two modes of ad-
Justing these instruments, which are founded on different
principles,

In the one, two points are/taken on: the limb of the circle ;
and when these are brought into. a _given- position, by means
of a plumb-line passing. over them, the microscope or index
is made to coincide with the zero point of the divisions : by
this method, the error in collimation remains constant; and;
if the adjustment is by any accident deranged, it can easily. be
rectified, and there will be no absolute necessity for frequently
reversing the instrument; $0 that this method seems well
adapted for large instruments, particularly if placed on stone
piers.
