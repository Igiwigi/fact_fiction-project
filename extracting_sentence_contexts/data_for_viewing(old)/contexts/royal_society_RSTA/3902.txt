People’s views on public benefit are, of course, dependent on their overall attitudes to the
particular policy (and government in general) and likely course of action taken as a result.
Therefore, engagement on data science needs to be done alongside/through the lens of tackling
the overall policy challenge, rather than the data method alone.

(b) Use data and tools that have the minimum intrusion necessary

The government should always use the minimum data necessary to achieve the public benefit.
This ‘minimization principle’ is set out for uses of personal data within the Data Protection Act.

There are steps that we can take to do this, e.g. de-identifying or aggregating data to higher
levels, keeping data in registers and querying against them (rather than seeing the whole dataset),
or using synthetic data. We need to be alert to the fact that increasing the amount of data available
increases the possibility of de-identified data being re-identifiable.

Often government will need to use identifiable data (and sometimes sensitive identifiable
data), or include large datasets to create good algorithmic models or identify wrongdoers. In
our research, participants were concerned about how this seemed to be in conflict with the
principle of innocent until proven guilty and using data from people who have done nothing
wrong to identify those who have. However, they did understand the need for this if it increased
the effectiveness of projects with clear public benefits. Participants with more experience of
government services were more accepting of using identifiable data as they could clearly see
how the service could be improved by doing so.

It is important to think about how to have the minimum intrusion necessary at different stages
