R.S. Read December 17, 1812. Trar a fluid, from which a portion is evaporated, becomes
colder in consequence of the heat absorbed by that part which
assumes the gaseous state: that fluids rise in the state of
vapour at a lower temperature when the pressure of the at-
mosphere is removed, and consequently may be cooled to a
lower degree by evaporation 7» vacuo than in the open air, are
facts too well known to need confirmation before the Members
of this Society by any new experiments. Nevertheless, a new mode of applying the most established
principles may deserve to be recorded, if it assist the illustra-
tion of them, and be instructive from the novelty of the view
in which it exhibits a certain class of phenomena; although
no immediate use be at present proposed, to which it can be
applied with advantage. If an attempt were made to freeze water by evaporation,
without other means than the vacuum of an air-pump, the
pump must be of the best construction, and though the quan-
tity of water be small, the receiver must be of large dimen-
sions, otherwise its capacity would set too confined a limit to
the quantity of vapour that will rise, and consequently to the
degree of cold produced.
