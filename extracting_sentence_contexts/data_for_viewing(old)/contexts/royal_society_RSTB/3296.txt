of crushed air-containing tissue with scattered sclerites. The ligule is a conspicuous
feature, and in a median longitudinal section of a young scale it is seen to have the
form of a narrow outgrowth separated for the greater part of its length from the
cone-scale. The micropyle is a long and narrow opening as in the other species
‘described, and the nucellus possesses the characteristic long and narrow beak. The
behaviour of the vascular strands in the scale has been fully described by WorspELL,*
and we can confirm his results.

A, Bidwillii.—The cone-scales of this species are distinguished by great breadth
and by the thickness of the prominent ligule (fig. 24,1). The two scales represented
in fig. 24, L and M, show the broad and massive seed-scale with the acuminate distal
end and the broad and stout ligule (/) resting on the surface of the scale. WorspELut
lays stress on the fact that in this species the bundles of the “ bract and seminiferous
scale arise quite independently from the central cylinder of the cone-axis, and at
a wide vertical distance apart.” The course of the two sets of bundles in the
cone-seale is similar to that in A. Cookii, but there is a marked tendency towards
a concentric disposition of the xylem and phleem. Worspreri notes that two
strands of phloem-like tissues were seen penetrating the chalazal part of the ovule ;
a statement agreeing with our observations in A. imbricata. We venture to dissent
from this author's conclusion that the separate origin of the bundles which enter the
cone-scale from the stele of the cone-axis “assuredly would not be likely to happen
if the appendicular organs which they supply represented a single scale.” { So far
as we are aware, the separate origin of the bundles is peculiar to this species, but
in view of the stoutness of the scale we see no fatal objection to the suggestion that,
in the course of evolution, bundles which were formerly united at their point of exit
