12°8° in “natives.” The slope of the dorsal segment of a rib is not an index to
the axis of movement of a costal arch, nor to the degree of slope of the arch;
the axis on which ribs move is largely determined by the spinal and other muscu-

lature attached to them; the lesser slope of the dorsal segments of the ribs in
natives does not necessarily signify a more inspiratory poise of their chests.

Another fact which shows that the ribs of natives have a greater slope as regards
their anterior, or ventral ends, is the relationship of the upper end of the sternum to
the vertebral column. Dr. Redfield has used a costo-clavicular plane to indicate the
upper limit of the thorax; the mean position of the plane in whites is opposite the
middle of the vertebral attachment of the fourth pair of ribs; in natives the plane
cuts towards the lower part of the same attachment.

Turning to the changes apparent in skiagrams taken of members of the Expedition
at high levels :—

In the case of Dr. Meakins, the right dome of the diaphragm at sea-level (Edinburgh)
was 20 mm. below the tenth-rib plane ; at Oroya it occupies the same relative level ;
in the first skiagraph taken at Cerro it has moved down to 30 mm.—assumed a
