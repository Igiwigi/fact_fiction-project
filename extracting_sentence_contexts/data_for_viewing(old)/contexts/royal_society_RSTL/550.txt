of double refraction. What is the mechanical condition of
crystals that form two images and polarise them in different
planes ; and what are the mechanical changes which must be
induced on uncrystallized bodies in order to communicate to
them these remarkable properties, are questions which are as
difficult to be answered at the present moment, as they were
in the days of HuyGHens and NEwToN.

In the frequent attempts which I have made to obtain a
solution of these difficulties, the polarisation of light by oblique
refraction was the only phenomenon that seemed to connect
itself with the inquiry ; but the hopes of success which this
fact inspired, were s0on found to be delusive, and the subject
resumed its former impregnable aspect. A new train of
experiments, however, has enabled me not only to give a

satisfactory answer to the questions which have been stated,
but to communicate to glass, and many other substances, by
the mere pressure of the hand, all the properties of the
different classes of doubly refracting crystals. The method
of producing these effects, and the consequences to which it
leads, will be briefly explained in the following letter.
