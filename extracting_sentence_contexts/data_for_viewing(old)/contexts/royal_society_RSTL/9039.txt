internal changes accompanying the deformations.

In making numerical application of the results of the previous discussions to the case
of the earth, it has of course been necessary to betake one's self to geological evidence;
but the vagueness of that evidence has precluded any great precision in the results,

In conclusion I must mention that, since this paper has been in manuscript, Sir
Wi Trors0s, in his Address to the Mathematical Section of the British Association
at Glasgow, has expressed his opinion on this same 8ubject. He there shortly states
results in the main identical with mine, but without indicating how they were arrived at.

The great interest which this subject has recently been exciting both in England and
America, coupled with the fact that several of my results are not referred to by Sir
W1lLLilax 'THoMs80N, induces me to persist in offering my work to the Royal Society.

1. PRECESSION OF A SPHEROID SLOWLY CHANGING ITS SHAPE.

I begin the investigation by discussing the precession and nutation of an ellipsoid of
revolution slowly and uniformly changing its shape. 'The changes are only supposed
to continue for such a time, that the total changes in the principal moments of inertia
are small compared to the difference between the greatest and least moments of inertia
of the ellipsoid in its initial state.

For brevity, I speak of the ellipsoid as the earth ; and shall omit some parts of the
investigation, which are irrelevant to the problem under discussion.
