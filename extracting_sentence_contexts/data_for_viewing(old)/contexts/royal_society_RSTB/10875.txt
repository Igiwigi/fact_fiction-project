availability. These insights have led to frequency-dependent
rethinking of both the evolution and contemporary manifes-
tations of sex roles across animal taxa [6]. Because the
numbers of males and females in a population structure
both individual reproductive options and_ interactions
between those of the same and opposite-sex, the ASR is
increasingly recognized a key demographic variable driving
behavioural variability of both sexes.

While current sex ratio research is proving fruitful, ASR
has not been well integrated across disciplines, or across
studies of humans and non-human animals. This develop-
ment may be due to the fact that theoretical, experimental
and comparative analyses on the causes and effects of ASR
variation are often carried out in isolation from each other,
and that their time scales may also differ (e.g. exploring the
evolution versus maintenance of a trait). In addition,
researchers studying human versus non-human animals
often use different terminology, methods and_ theory,
making synergistic work challenging. However, results
from parallel lines of inquiry often produce consistent results
and could usefully inform one another. These findings chal-
lenge longstanding claims of greater male investment in
mating effort and the pursuit of multiple partners in the
face of mate scarcity. Furthermore, a new synthesis is
