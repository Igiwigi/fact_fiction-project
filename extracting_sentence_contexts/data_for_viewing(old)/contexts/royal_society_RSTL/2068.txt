glion and its plexuses were then irritated by the point of the scalpel, and at
length cut across in various directions ; but although the beats of the heart
were repeatedly counted during these operations, they continued uniformly of
the same frequency. Spirit of wine was then applied to the wounded gan-
glion and plexuses, but without the least change in the beats of the heart. A
strong infusion of tobacco in water was now applied, but with the same result,
the beatings of the heart being still sixteen in ten seconds ; nor could any
yariation in the force of the beats be observed in any part of the experiment.

It appears from this experiment that we cannot influence the organs sup-
plied by the ganglionic nerves by causes affecting the ganglions and plexuses,
independently of the brain and spinal marrow; and the inferences from this
and the preceding facts are unavoidable, that the former organs make only
a part of the channel through which the influence of the latter is conveyed ;
and that the peculiar office of the ganglions and plexuses is to combine the
influence of the nerves which terminate and are blended in them, and send off
nerves endowed with their combined influence, in consequence of which the

is as much a function of volition as the motion of a limb, and consequently ceases when the sensibility
is wholly destroyed.
