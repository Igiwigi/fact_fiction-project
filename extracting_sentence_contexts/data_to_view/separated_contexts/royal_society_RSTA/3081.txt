Operators P;,j =1,2,3,
are orthogonal projectors on corresponding subspaces of A (convergent power series in e\k|). Hence, we obtain the following general asymptotic formula valid for almost all x € R!:

where N is the same as in (4.6) and the constants in O symbols are bounded in norm (3.3)
uniformly with respect to xé€R!. It is also possible to prove (see lemma 12 in [24]) that the
second term from (4.8) is in fact of order O[exp(—ct/e)], c > 0, but the simplified estimate (4.9)
is sufficient for our goals. The constant r is not very important; the same formula (4.13) is valid for
any independent of ¢ fixed constant r’ < r. The final step is to consider various approximations of
asymptotic formula (4.13).
