Some objections might, perhaps, be raised to this, on account
of Productus and Aulosteges, as neither have teeth or sockets, though both undoubt-
edly belong to the articulated group. But notwithstanding these deficiencies, the valves
are related to each other as if hinged, and the cardinal process is 80 locked into the beak
of the opposite valve, as to have prevented any lateral movement. The distinctive feature,
however, is not in the mere fact of articulation, but in the mode of opening the valves ;
and in these two genera there was apparently no deviation in this respect from the rest
of the group. = With regard to the affinities of the Brachiopods, it is impozsible not to be struck with
S the strong resemblance that exists between the organization of these animals and that
Â© of the Tunicata and Polyzon. In the first place, they are all three, with a few excep-
S tions, attached to foreign bodies; and in all, the respiratory organ is appended to the
mouth, serving at the same time the purpose of 8ustentation.
