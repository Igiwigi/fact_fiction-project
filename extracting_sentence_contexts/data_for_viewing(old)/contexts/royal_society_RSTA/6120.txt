more relevant methods for neural probe fabrication, all based on silicon wafers, were identified
and are presented as follows.

The first method and perhaps the most well-established one would be that of back grinding.
This technique consists of a coarse-grinding step, followed by a fine-grinding one, done on the
non-active back of the chip by a grinding wheel. The chip is stuck in place by an adhesive tape,
which as mentioned in [64] has an effect on the total thickness variation. This technique has the
advantage of being cost-effective, very rapid and has been shown to achieve very fine thicknesses
of down to 3m [65], although it can cause some damage to the chip in the form of warping and
breakage during manipulation of the chip. Some could also argue that given that neural probes
are very delicate structures, such a technique should not be considered. However, if one were
to perform chip thinning before the integration step of the soft substrate with the more rigid
electronics, the risk of damage to the neural probe could be attenuated. In fact, a study performed
by Sacher ef al. [66] demonstrated that back grinding could be a suitable chip thinning method for
photonic neural probes with a thickness ranging from 50-92 um. In addition to this, there have
been techniques explored to reduce mechanical damage to the chips caused by back grinding,
such as the one explored by Morcom eft al. [67], known as taiko, where grinding is not performed
on the periphery of the back, non-active side of the wafer, leaving a ring structure that enhances
the structural integrity of the wafer.

The second method has been gaining more interest within the literature in recent years. It is
the process of chip thinning through etching, which can be done in two ways: dry etching or
wet etching. In terms of dry etching, there are different types, mainly RIE, deep reactive ion
etching (DRIE) and physical ion etching (PIE). The first two types use plasma to chemically
