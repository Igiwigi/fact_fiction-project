The ultimate branchlets in the two species also differ to some extent. In S. oldhamia the
outer cortical cells are elongated and form a kind of palisade tissue, whereas in S. burnt-
tslandica the cortical cells are practically round. The microsporangium of S. burntislandica and the sporangium of S. oldhamia are also
similar except for the fact that in the former the sporangial wall is only one cell in thickness,
whereas in the latter it is multiseriate. From the above comparison one cannot but be impressed by the fact that, except for
some minor differences, the two species are very closely related. Now that heterospory is
shown in S. burntislandica it is suggested that megasporangia should also be found in the
other species.
