the curve {x = x(t); t € R} is the integral curve of I,(-), a=1,2,3:

H(t) = tt) =Ih(x(t)), a=1,2,3. (6.1)

Now it pays to introduce some notation, via (6.2)—(6.4)2. Note that because J,(-) is a right invariant
field, it is determined by its value at x = 0, by putting x = 0, x (0, y) = y in (2.17). Then if p € Rp =
pili(0) say, and p(t) represents a point of the integral curve of the right invariant field pjl;(x), with
arbitrary initial point p(0), one may define the mapping exp(tp) : G > G by

(expltp))(p) =p), po) eG ER’. (62)
Also introduce the group element e’? via
e!P = (exp(tp))(0). (6.3)
It is an important fact that
(explip))(@) = x(e?,x) =e?x, e'?, x EG, (6.4)

where the juxtaposition of group elements, as in (6.4)2, is to represent group multiplication. In
other words, the process of exponentiation, defined via the right invariant fields {1,(-)} maps an
element p of the Lie algebra to the group G. Note that the bracket operation in the algebra can be
defined in a familiar way.

So one envisages that, when we are dealing with right invariant fields in a Lie group G, that
if there is a point of some representative structure at 0, then there are also points at e’, and by
iterating also at ee”, etc. So the relevant set of points is a subgroup of G.

Now the ‘crystallographic restriction’ which produces the perfect lattices of crystallography is
