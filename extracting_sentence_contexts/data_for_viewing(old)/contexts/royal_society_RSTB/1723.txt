8. Structural Anomalies.

So far we have concerned ourselves with the normal structure of the Lyginodendron —
stem, such as is common to a majority of the numerous specimens investigated.
Some interesting departures from this typical anatomy occur in individual specimens,
The most remarkable and perhaps the most frequent of these anomalies depended on {
the appearance of a secondary meristem at the outer border of the pith. In some —
stems this medullary meristem gave rise merely to secondary parenchyma, with some- L
what thickened walls; in other cases, however, it acted as a regular cambium, :
producing medullary wood and bast with inverted orientation. In the latter case, we
have precisely the same anomaly as in Tecoma, odes, or Acantholimon among recent
plants. It is a most remarkable fact, that this peculiarity should have already
appeared as an occasional variation ina carboniferous plant, so absolutely remote from
the Dicotyledons as is Lyginodendron. A more striking warning against the indis-
criminate use of, even conspicuous anatomical characters cannot be imagined. Such —
a warning, it is true, is not needed by those who have experience in anatomy. The
anomaly in question is known to be of very inconstant occurrence at the present day. —
Both in the genera, Tecoma and odes, some species show it and others do not,
though analogous peculiarities (internal phloém for example) are often characteristic
of entire natural orders. Anatomical characters, in fact, like any other characters,
are sometimes of great constancy, sometimes highly variable, while the same
character, which is relatively constant in one family may be most inconstant in
other groups.
