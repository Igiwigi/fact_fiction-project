This means that empowering Lawson, Hillard Kaplan, Gert Stulp, Susie Schaffnit, Paula Sheppard,
women to pursue fitness-relevant goals is unlikely to explain Sandra Virgo, Michael Muthukrishna, two anonymous reviewers and

the members of the ‘Integrating Evolutionary Models of Human
Fertility Change’ meeting for constructive feedback on earlier ver-
sions of this paper. James Joseph Nelson helped put together the

demographic transitions towards lower fertility if these repro-
ductive strategies are associated with lower long-term fitness

[80,81]. Similarly, the fact that polygyny and patrilocality are empirical review of the IFS literature. Joe Henrich provided helpful

associated with population growth or higher fertility, without insights regarding the discussion of polygyny. References
