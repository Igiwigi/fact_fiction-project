found [43], and lipid mobility differs in the setae compared to the skin [40]. These chemical and
structural differences specific to the adhesive setae suggest that proteins and lipids, and their
arrangement, have a functional role, though it is not clear if this role is specific to the adhesive
system, anti-adhesive system, both or something entirely different.

The anti-adhesive, superhydrophobic gecko toe pad is also dynamic. The surface groups of the
gecko setae rearrange in water [44], changing from methy] to methylene [15]. It is likely that these
groups are associated with unbound lipids on the surface of the setae [15,40]. The implication for
this rearrangement is unknown, though it may significantly hinder the anti-adhesion property of
the gecko toe [44]. Specifically, though the gecko toe is highly superhydrophobic and stable, even
at pressures more than 12 kPa [9], agitation can change the wetting state from the Cassie—Baxter
(heterogeneous solid-liquid and air—liquid interface) to the Wenzel (homogeneous solid-liquid
interface; figure 2) [9,14,45-47]. In fact, the Wenzel state is the thermodynamically stable wetting
state, as shown by wetting of the toe pad by water after being kept in 100% RH for 3-4 days and by
thermodynamic modelling [9]. When the gecko toe pad transitions into the Wenzel state, the toe
is no longer adhesive [14,45,48], though the gecko is capable of active self-drying by walking [45].
Although the Cassie-Baxter state is the non-thermodynamically stable state, the toe’s ability to
retain this property, even underwater, allows geckos to adhere to wet surfaces [13,48].

(c) Potential roles for anti-adhesion

The role of the anti-adhesive nature of the gecko toe pad, if there is one, is not well resolved.
Clearly, this property is critical for adhesion on wet surfaces [13,48], but why the Cassie—Baxter,
non-wetting state is not the stable state, why surface groups are dynamic, and why the protein
