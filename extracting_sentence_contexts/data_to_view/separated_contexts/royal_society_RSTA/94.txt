Ifsuch a mode of ternary fission occurs, the triple tracks produced in photographic plates
are in many cases entirely similar to those caused by heavy nuclear recoils, and the two types
of track are not always distinguishable by the application of rules based on the principle of
conservation of momentum. The plates used in the experimental investigation of recoil
tracks (ยง3) were fully sensitive to light recoils, and would therefore have recorded tracks of
heavy fragments produced in ternary fission. In this investigation, such tracks would have
been included in the count of heavy recoils; the fact that the observed abundance of heavy
recoils was fairly low (1 in 29 fission events) proves that fission into three heavy fragments
is not of frequent occurrence. An independent investigation of a large number of fission tracks was undertaken in a
search for triple tracks which could be ascribed definitely to ternary fission as distinct from
heavy recoils. No such track was found in 5000 fission events examined in a plate which
was fully sensitive to heavy ions but insensitive to a-particles.
