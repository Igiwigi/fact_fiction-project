which it resides.

Recently, this prediction of a change in slope of a log P(t) versus log ¢ plot seen
in equations (4.2) and (4.3) was tested experimentally by studying the power
spectral density for the distributed lifetimes of the QDs (Pelton et al. 2007). The
prediction from equations (4.2) and (4.3) was that there be a change in the slope
of unity in this quantity at some time ¢.. The prediction of a change in slope,
perhaps the only one thus far for QDs, was later confirmed in experiments by
Pelton et al. (2007). The results are reproduced in figure 9. This confirmation
does not mean that the theory is correct, of course, but it is one hurdle that
was crossed.

This reaction—diffusion model serves to explain a number of the facts, such
as the tendency for the power in the power law to be approximately -3 on the
average, and there being a cut-off for the ‘on times’, and the prediction of a
change in slope. However, how does one explain the asymmetry—why is there
not a cut-off for the ‘off’ times, or at least not an easily discernable cut-off in the
time scale of intermittency?

An important new set of experiments was performed for different excitation
wavelengths at room temperature (Knappenberger et al. 2007). The power law
for the ‘off? behaviour was observed at all excitation energies. In the new
experiments a pure power law for the ‘on’ behaviour was observed at low
excitation energies. At higher energies, sufficient to excite the electron from the
valence band to the P, state, there was the often seen exponential cut-‘off’ for the
