During the course of this work, it was observed (Stedman & Stedman 1944) that the
nuclei of the liver cells and erythrocytes of the salmon differed from the sperm heads of
this species in containing histones. This was contrary to expectations, for, while protamins
were known to occur in the sperm heads of a number of species of fish, others, in particular
the cod, contain a histone. This, coupled with the fact that the two types of basic protein
have never been observed to occur together in the same cell, suggested that their bio-
logical functions are identical and that consequently the chemical differences which
distinguish salmine (salmon protamin) from cod histone are merely expressions in an
unusually marked form of the species differences which are known to occur between
homologous proteins of different species. Since, moreover, there was no reason for sus-
pecting cell specificity in the basic proteins of a given species, it was anticipated that the
nuclei of the somatic cells of the salmon would all contain a protamin identical with that
in the sperm heads. Not only did this anticipation prove to be incorrect, but there
appeared to be a difference, quite outside the limits of experimental error, between the
histones isolated from the nuclei of the erythrocytes and the liver cells.
