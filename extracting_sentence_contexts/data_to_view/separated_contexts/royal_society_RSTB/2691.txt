Very little ingrowth of connective tissue from the thece had occurred, and what had
was looser and more irregular than the normal ingrowth. â€˜The cavity contained a
fluid resembling the liquor of the Graafian follicle, but staining somewhat more deeply. There was no blood-clot, such as sometimes occurs in atretic follicles in the rabbit's
ovaries, nor any indication that there had been a breaking down of vessels, or rupture
to the exterior. No recognisable trace of the ovum was found, but this may have
been due to the fact that some sections were unfortunately lost in the cutting. K 2
