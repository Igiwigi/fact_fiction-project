AcNes ArBer (Miss Ropertson, 1906)—who was the first to investigate this
interesting genus in detail—while fundamentally agreeing with this view, appears
to have been impressed, rather more than the other authors, by certain features
in which Phyllocladus seemed to approach the Taxinew rather than the Podo-
earpinese. However, at the time when Mrs. ArBer wrote her lucid paper on Phyllo-
cladus our knowledge of the Podocarpineze was very meagre : in the light of facts which
have since been observed, out of the few characters which were then suggested as being
Taxinean rather than Podocarpean, all except one appear to lose much of their value.

(i) Presence of Centripetul Wood in the Cladodes.—Mrs. ArBer herself does not
lay much stress on this point, and I think justly. It is still a moot point whether trans-
fusion tracheides found in the vicinity of the protoxylem, and often separated from
it by parenchyma, should be reckoned as true centripetal xylem.
