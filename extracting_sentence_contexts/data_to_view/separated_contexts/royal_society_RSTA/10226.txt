Thus
Deviation of offspring from mean of population _
Deviation of fathers from mean of population

We have then the following results, which could certainly not have been fore-
seen :—

(w.) The regression is constant for all arrays, or the regression curve is a straight

line.

().) The slope of this straight line is 4, or, since we have seen that the population

is stable, the parental correlation is 3 also. Now these results are of very singular importance. A very general theory of the
pure gamete type leads to linearity of the regression curve, a result amply verified
by observations on inheritance in populations ;* and this result is quite independent
of the number of couplets supposed to form the total character of the parent, or of
the fact that in this case the arrays of offspring are skew and do not obey the normal
law.t Further, the value of the correlation reached is numerically identical with the
value obtained by Francis GALron in his original investigations on the inheritance
of stature! The generalised theory of the pure gamete is thus shown, whatever the
number of couplets taken, to lead to precisely the chief results already obtained by those
who have studied heredity statistically. So far then it might appear that a
generalised theory of the pure gamete was capable of being brought into accordance
with the chief results of biometric experience in heredity.
