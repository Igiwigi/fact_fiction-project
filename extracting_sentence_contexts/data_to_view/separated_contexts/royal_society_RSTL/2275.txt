At about one inch below the last
point of its attachment with the body, the rectum was ob-
served to perforate the sac, the tenuity of which rendered the
course of that intestine, as indeed that of all the digestive
organs readily traced. They are apparently sustained beneath
the ribs (which latter appear very imperfect), by a membra-
nous expansion, as they are not affected in their position by
any inflation or emptying of the sac. That the sac itself
communicates with the pharynx, is sufficiently proved by the
fact, that if the blowpipe were further introduced, the diges-
tive organs were alone inflated, the sac undergoing no change
in its dimensions. The nearest point of analogy therefore to
this structure observable in the class Pisces, is seen among
the diodons and tetraodons, where a kind of ingluvies, or crop,
formed of a very thin and extensible membrane, adheres
closely to the peritonzzum throughout the whole extent of the

abdomen, by means of which their curious and rapid power of
inflation has long excited surprise, though we cannot in the

smooth Ophiognathus so satisfactorily account for its use, as

among these fishes, which by its distention, mechanically

elevate their spines, and thus float about in safety. This

external sac might again be compared with the more internal

air vesicle of most other kinds of fishes, and especially that

of the sturgeon kind, which has s0 large and free a commu-
nication with the cesophagus ; but in extending our enquiries
on this subject further, we find no class among the vertebral
animals which does not offer s0me modification of a similar
structure ; for even among the mammalia, the whales, which
are called the balznz boops and rostrata, also the balzna
musculus, if it be a distinct species, have the anterior part of
the body covered with an extremely elastic skin, plaited into
deep folds, as Mr. HunTtr has expressed it, © like unto a
ribbed stocking,”” and capable of a vast extent of dilatation,
This is partly exhibited in the act of swallowing food, and
appears reasonably intended, by communicating with the
external air, to render the body so specifically light, as to
enable them to sleep with greater ease upon the surface.
