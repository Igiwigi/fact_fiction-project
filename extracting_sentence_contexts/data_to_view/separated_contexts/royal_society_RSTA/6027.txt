) couples with pressure corrugation as seen in the distribution of R/Lr in figure 7b, and Ete)
and R/Lr exhibit a clear (face to face) in-phase relation. Namely, the steepening of the temperature
profile is regulated not by a simple turbulent suppression due to the Ege shear, but by the
balance with the Ego? field itself through radial force balance relation. This is also consistent with
the fact that FY shale and 3E®) are in-phase, and 5E®) is determined so as to satisfy the radial

force balance relation. It is also worth noting the role of zonal flow damping. That is, the zonal
flow and associated radial electric field are affected by either collision-less damping or collisional
effects.
