H is true when x = a or false when z > 2. But it may often be proved that if we
behave according to such a rule, then in the long run we shall reject H when it is true
not more, say, than once in a hundred times, and in addition we may have evidence
that we shall reject H sufficiently often when it is false.

If we accept the words “ an efficient test of the hypothesis H ” to mean simply such
a rule of behaviour as just described, then we agree with Bore that efficient tests
are possible. We agree also that not any character, x, whatever is equally suitable to
be a basis for an efficient test,t and the main purpose of the present paper is to find
a general method of determining tests, which, from the above point of view would
be the most efficient.

In common statistical practice, when the observed facts are described as “‘ samples,”
and the hypotheses concern the “ populations” from which the samples have been
drawn, the characters of the samples, or as we shall term them criteria, which have
been used for testing hypotheses, appear often to have been fixed by a happy intuition.
They are generally functions of the moment coefficients of the sample, and as long as
the variation among the observations is approximately represented by the normal
frequency law, moments appear to be the most appropriate sample measures that we
can use. But as Fisner{ has pointed out in the closely allied problem of
Estimation, the moments cease to be efficient measures when the variation departs
widely from normality. Further, even though the moments are efficient, there is
considerable choice in the particular function of these moments that is most appropriate
to test a given hypothesis, and statistical literature is full of examples of confusion of
thought on this choice.
