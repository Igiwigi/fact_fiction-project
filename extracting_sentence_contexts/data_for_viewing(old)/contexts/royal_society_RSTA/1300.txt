demonstrate the case when only one mass transfer mechanism (volume diffusion) takes place
with allowance for the initial ‘tail’ of the distribution function. For comparison, the classical
Lifshitz-Slyozov asymptotic solutions are shown by the dotted lines (their solutions were
obtained without taking into account the initial conditions at the stage of Ostwald ripening).

As is easily seen, the simultaneous operation of various mass transfer mechanisms changes the
system behaviour drastically. In the first instance, the growth rate decreases and the distribution
function moves to the left when decreasing the blocking point up. As this takes place, the
maximum points of v,(u) and P(u) decrease and are shifted to smaller particle radii u. Thus,
the presence of various mass transfer mechanisms, which operate synchronously, shifts the bell-
shaped distribution function, as a whole, in the direction of smaller particle radii. Moreover, the
smaller the blocking point, the greater the shift. Taking the initial tail of the distribution function
into account leads to the fact that the right branch rises and falls to the right of the blocking
point of the Lifshitz-Slyozov theory (at u > uy > ug). It is also significant that the exponent n of
the initial ‘tail’ of the distribution function has a crucial role in the behaviour of vy(u) and P(u)
(compare the corresponding panels in figures 1 and 2). Indeed, these functions undergo larger
shifts when increasing the exponent n (when the initial ‘tail’ is steeper).

The present analytical solution (3.18) for the distribution function is compared with
experimental data in figure 3. Taking into account the synchronous operation of several mass
transfer mechanisms makes it possible to compare the left branch of the distribution function with

P(u)
