Koshy 1933; Sax and Sax 1935;
Darlington 1935; etc.). In Osmunda, as in other plants, it is almost though not quite
complete by metaphase; the lowest chromosome in fig. 46, Plate 17, still shows one
turn. The fact that untwisting is geometrically necessary before the half-chromosomes
can separate is clear evidence that the spiral shape of the unsplit chromosome must
be of the torsional type. The occurrence of untwisting in prophase does not, however,
in itself justify any deduction further than this, and the nature of the twist in the
definitive chromosome, i.e. whether constructional or unstable, can only be inferred
from other evidence. Some other evidence is supplied by the behaviour of the spiral through the mitotic
cycle.
