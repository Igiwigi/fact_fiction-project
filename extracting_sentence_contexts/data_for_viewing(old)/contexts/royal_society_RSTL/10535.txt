average. The heavy crop of the first year had been characterised by great stemminess
and maturity, and the heavy ones of the second and fourth years by luxunant leafy
growth. The first (1868), and the third and smallest crop (1870), were the reault, of
seasons of drought and heat ; in the cage of the heavy crop the drought and heat
coming late, and 8ucceeding upon previous Juxuriance, and in the case of the light
erop commencing early, and sneceeding upon previous backward conditions.

Although the freer growth of the wetter seasons mus obviously affect the relative
predominance of the different components of the mixed herbage, seasons of heat and
drought, like those of 1868 and 1870 (though they were 80 very different from one
another), have a much greater influence in this respect. In fact, there is no doubt
that the distribution and predominance of species in 1872 was influenced, not only by
the continuous application of the different manures from year to year, but materially
also by the characters and the growth of the several preceding seasons, especially by
those of the years of drought and heat.

We come now to the characters and the growth of the season of 1872 itself. July
1871 was characterised by a considerable excess of rain and low temperatures ; August
and the first half of September were warm and dry ; but the end of September was
very wet, cold, and stormy. October, November, and December were consider-
ably deficient, in rain, with lower than average temperatures. Mr. Glaisher states,
indeed, that November and the firsb half of December were characterised by the
longest continuance of low temperatures in the cenbury for that period of the year.
