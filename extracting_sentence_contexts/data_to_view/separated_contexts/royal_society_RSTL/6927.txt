There is one seeming difficulty to this hypothesis, which must occur to every field
geologist: it is, the apparently distinct separation of the Loess and the underlying
gravels wherever they occur in as8ociation. But a close examination will sometimes
show thin seams of loam, not to be distinguished from the Loess, intercalated in the
gravels, especially in the higher levels, though as a rule the masses of this material
invariably overlie the gravels. The explanation of this fact is, I apprehend, to be found
in the circumstance that it is only when the shingle or gravel ceased to be deposited,
owing to the changes in the leyel or course of the river, that the Loess could accumulate. So long as the place was in the direct line and on the level of the stream, and subject
to its scouring action, no such depoxit could take place. Consequently, s0 long as the
bed of the old river was on the leyel of d, diag.
