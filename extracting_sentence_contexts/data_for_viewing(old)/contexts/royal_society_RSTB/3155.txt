another and to the rest of the uninjured cranium.

Ten years after this operation the lad was examined. He was then 19 years old,
strong and robust. The skull was firm all over, the bones over the site of prior
injury had grown in proportion with the rest of the skull.


IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND REGENERATION OF BONE. 265

GrowtH oF Bone in Mouscte.

In the foregoing (and in some of the subsequent) observations attention has been
called to the fact that muscles lying alongside of bone, which had been bereft of
its periosteum, were apt to have the connective tissue surrounding their contiguous
muscular fibres infiltrated with osteoblasts, and hence they became adherent to the
fresh osseous layers forming on the outside of the shaft.

This was more marked where the nude bone was introduced in the shape of small
shavings and the muscles were made to intimately surround them, and more
especially where the connective tissue covering of the muscle fibres was lacerated.
At such places the invasion of the osteoblasts was greater.

An instance of the growth of bone in the midst of torn muscle, at a distance from
the source of the osteoblastic supply, may be here given, as its history is known, and
it may throw light upon other cases of a similar kind.
