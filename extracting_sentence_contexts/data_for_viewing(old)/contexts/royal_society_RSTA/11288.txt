Consider the flow between the two surfaces y and y + dy across the “ parallel of
latitude” through P. The total flow must be the same for every parallel. The area
through which the flow takes place is 27pdn, where p is the distance of P from the

polar axis. Hence 2apv cos fdn is constant over the surface p. It must therefore
be of the form f(y) dys. So far wis only defined as the parameter which determines
the particular surface. Choose the parameter so that f(y) = 1. ¥ is then analogous
to the stream-function in the simple case. It acts in fact as the stream-function for
the component of velocity v cos ¢. Similar reasoning leads to the conclusion that
wp cos ydn is also of the form f(p) dip, say fds. Hence

We started with the supposition that the stream-lines and vortex-lines must lie on
the same surfaces yw. In other words, there must be no component rotation perpen-
dicular to y. This may be expressed in other words by the statement that the
circulation round any cireuit drawn wholly on y must vanish. Take for this circuit
any two parallels of latitude. The condition gives that the flow along one must
