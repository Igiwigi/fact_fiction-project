which a solid central bundle develops a medulla within its own component vessels.
The medulla is existent ab initio, surrounded by a circle of such vessels. Thus, in
Aspidium filix mas this medulla has a diameter of about a tenth of an inch close to
the growing apex of the stem, and at its utmost development it rarely attains to more
than four times that diameter; even then the interspaces between the bundles
composing the entire vascular cylinder are very large. This is very different as to
details from some examples found amongst the Lepidodendra, where a medulla
developed from some invisible cell-germ has expanded to more than an inch in
diameter.

Plate 8, fig. 28, represents a transverse section of a Rachiopteris, of which I have
several sections. At the first glance its central vascular bundle, cut through
transyersely, has a Zygopteroid aspect, but it differs in the fact that, whilst its side
a consists of a line of large vessels, its opposite side b is composed of very small
ones: at the two points ¢, c’ the bundle consists of a number of the small vessels
resembling those at b, but here forming an irregular mass surrounding a vacant space
at each end of the central portion, a, b ; at d a cluster of these small vessels is detached
in Zygopteroid fashion, as if going to supply some peripheral organ. The outer
cortex is composed of an uniform cellular tissue. I propose the name of Rachiopteris
irreqularis for this very distinct organism, which is from Halifax.
