hull.” In the final specification, dated 23rd July 1866, it is described as *<* =. an
electro-magnet from end to end over, and in contact with the main plates of the hi p—
"There is some obscurity in both specifications, from the patentee not ate,
between electric currents and lines of magnetic force ; but whatever may be the SGT
of the method described in the provisional specification, it is certain that that method
would be utterly inadequate to produce any sensible effect in a large ship.

} 'The method described in the final specification would no doubt produce, wherever
| applied, some local effect ; but the effect produced by the local application of magnetic
force of high and rapidly varying intensity must necessarily be wholly different, from that
hich has arisen from the general application of a force of low and uniform intensity.
nd the former cannot possibly produce any general destruction of the latter. The pro-
Zcos is in fact not one of general demagnetization, but of partial counter magnetization.
EZThe result will be an irregular distribution of magnetism of very variable intensity,
Enecessarily very unstable, and producing, wherever effective, a rapidly varying field of
7 orce. The justice of these remarks will, I think, be shown in the sequel.

PS In April 1866 Mr. Horkixs applied to the Admiralty for permission to experiment on
-Zthe < Northumberland,” the largest and most heavily armoured ship in the Royal Navy.
:SThe application was in the usual course referred to the Magnetic department, and on a
report that no injury was to be apprehended, the required permission was granted *,

| The first trials were made on the 4th August 1866, and are thus described by
*>Mr. Hoyexixs in a report dated 10th August, and received at the Admiralty a few
days afterwards. * After having ascertained the actual magnetic condition of the ship.
