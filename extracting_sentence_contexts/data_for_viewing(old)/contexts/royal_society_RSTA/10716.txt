256 DR. H. T. BARNES ON THE CAPACITY FOR HEAT OF WATER

different experiments, and all give identically the same temperature coefficient of
variation. For the ice experiment on March 24, of Series I., the value of h is very
nearly in agreement with the extrapolated value from Series I. and IT. Hence the
above method of treatment for this experiment would give an almost identical value
of d to the one obtained by eliminating the heat-loss from the two flows.

It is important to notice that the value of d in this experiment, obtained from the
two flows, is more in agreement with the mean value of d for the other ice experi-
ments, obtained by extrapolating from the values of 4 in Series VI. than for the
values obtained by eliminating the heat-loss in the usual way. This points to the
fact that the values given above are more nearly correct than the values given in the
tables for the same experiments. If this be so, the indication is, that the value of the
specific heat of water rapidly approaches an exceedingly high value at 0°, and in a
remarkable way substantiates the suggestions made by Rowianp in his memoir in
regard to this. Further investigation is needed, however, in the neighbourhood of
the freezing-point of water, before we can say that the specific heat of water
approaches an infinite value as that point is reached. Such questions, as the con-
tinuity of the curve for under-cooled water, render the idea quite unthinkable at
present. In view of this uncertainty, I have adhered to the lowest of the values of
the specific heat given by these measurements, and have consequently included them
both in the tables and plot. Even in this case, the change of specific heat with
temperature is very rapid, and no effect is shown by the observations taken below 4°
which would indicate a change at the point of maximum density. This, however, is
