where the symbols have their usual meanings in band spectrum notation.*

Some difficulty was occasioned by the fact that in this case neither B, nor «, are
accurately linear functions of v, as assumed in the definitions of « and a,, with the
consequence that neither of these quantities is strictly constant. The correction to
B which is in question is so small, however, that it appeared to be quite satisfactory
to use mean values for « and «,.

D, having been determined, it becomes possible to calculate the term involving it,
subtract this from the observed combination difference and thence derive an improved
value of B. If such a value is found from each difference, its probable error will be
inversely as (4J +2), since all the differences are of the same order of accuracy and
each is divided by (4J + 2). Itis therefore preferable to form the sum of the differences
and divide by = (4J +2). This gives equal weight to all the observations and also
necessitates considerably less labour. It has the further advantage of greatly simplifying
