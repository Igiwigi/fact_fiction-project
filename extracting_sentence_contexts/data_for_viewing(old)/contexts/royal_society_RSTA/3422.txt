ini the entropies grow quadratically [31], as expected by simply expanding the
expressions in equations (2.2) and (2.3). Subsequently, the increase is nearly linear until saturation.
The linear increase of the entropies reflects the large number of decay channels available for the
initial state, not necessarily the presence of level repulsion. This was stressed in [18,21,22], where
clean models were considered, and also in [19] for disordered systems. In [21,22], the Shannon
entropy was studied for initial states corresponding to mean-field basis vectors. This allowed
for the derivation of analytical expressions following the steps discussed in [74]. In [18], both
entropies were considered, but only for two specific site-basis vectors, the Néel state and the
domain wall state. Here, we average the results over 50 different site-basis vectors and also over
20 realizations of random border defects, so the curves are smoother.

The fact that both entropies lead to very similar behaviours suggests that any of the two can
be equivalently used to study non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this context, entanglement Dos
does not appear to be an essential property [67,75]. The advantage of the Shannon entropy is to =

At first sight, the results for the entropies in the main panels of figure 1 seem unable to fo
