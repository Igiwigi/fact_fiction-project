'= cesophageal valve, which projects for a long distance into the cavity of the mid-gut.
8 The food consequently has only to traverse a very small portion,of the latter region
@ before entering the hind-gut. On reaching the hind intestine the wood is in a condi-
el tion of minute fragments and particles, and the greater bulk of it gradually becomes
taken up and absorbed by the numerous intestinal Protozoa. By means of the
= phloroglucin reaction, I have been able to satisfy myself that the numerous particles
5 included within the cytoplasm in Trichonympha and Trichomonas consist entirely of
2 ~~ ligneous matter. Within the protoplasm of these organisms the woody material
3 @ undergoes chemical changes, and, when ejected from the bodies of the Protozoa, much
: of it is in a condition capable of being assimilated as food by the host Termite. How
8 and where assimilation actually takes place is a difficult physiological problem,
involving a knowledge of micro-chernical methods which I do not possess. A
significant fact is that the ligneous particles are not subjected to the action of the
secretions of the mid-gut. Their passage through the latter appears to be very rapid,
and on no occasion have I found woody matter in that region of the digestive system.
The mid-gut frequently contains a thick fluid material which also extends up into
the ceca. This fluid appears to be regurgitated from the hind-gut, and I believe is
the product of the breaking down and “emulsification ” of the wood by the action of
the Protozoa. The readmission of solid particles into the mid-gut is effectually
precluded by means of the pyloric valve already described (p. 112, and text-fig. 10).
An interesting experiment is afforded by enclosing half a dozen or more soldiers in
a phial, unaccompanied by any wood or other available food. These individuals can
