fat crystals, and although we also think that fat crystals may greatly increase the
radiate appearance, yet we have found the radiate zone, as in figs. 14 and 16, after
prolonged subjection of the sections to the fat solvents mentioned above. Coupled
with these curious facts we have found others equally hard to interpret. Thus, in
addition to the opaque ochroid roe-like bodies, we have met with others, transparent
and gelatinous, which, when pressed under a cover slip, exhibited a radiate structure-
less and refractive peripheral zone; yet, from microchemical testing, we could draw
no conclusions as to their nature. Similarly, when we read the records of Carrer
and Lewis and CunNniNGHAM, we find that they record cases in which the specimens
contained innumerable cayenne pepper-like granules.

Comment upon these various anomalies would be out of place, and therefore, in
spite of the fact that although we have examined comparatively a very large number
of specimens, we think it would be rash to state that the white particles are always
Actinomycotic, and may not in certain cases represent some other parasite.

Conclusion.

The object of this paper has been to show that in the Madura foot disease the white
and black particles are of different nature, and to set forth the means whereby these
differences can_be displayed.

ADDENDUM.

Since this paper was written we have had the opportunity of examining a very
