Still, there was, over the whole
Zperiod, scarcely more than half of the supplied nitrogen estimated to be recovered ; Zand even over the last six years, in five of which 'scond crops were removed, there
was, s0 far as can be estimated, only about bwo-thirds of the annually supplied nitrogen
nnually recovered. In fact, when, as is now done, the results of five more years, in
-2four of which second crops were removed, are brought into the calculation, the general
Zeonclusions as stated in Part I., where the points under discussion, and the explana-
Stion of the facts, are more fully considered than would be appropriate here, are not
Sinvalidated. 8, Finally, as will be judged from the results of the separations which have been
<=considered, the general aspect of this plot was nob widely different from that of the
Sunmanured plots ; but it exhibited a greater preponderance of grasses, and some
â€”Zincreased depth of colour, and luxuriance. The appearance of the herbage was,

Bnevertheless, upon the whole, that of restricted growth.
