(2.) The investigation, then, having advanced thus far, it seemed desirable, as a se-
quel to my former papers, to devote the present to some remarks connected with the
theory which has been thus applied. The facts of interference, on which the undulatory theory was originally based by
Dr. Youxs, obliged us to adopt some idea of an alternating motion, as well as a motion
of translation, in our conception of light. And this, with all the accessions it has re-
ceived, especially from the investigations of FrzsxeL, has at the present day been con-
nected by the labours of M. Caveny and others with general dynamical principles,
which regulate the propagation of vibratory motions through an elastic medium. (3.)
