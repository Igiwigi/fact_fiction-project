power photograph of the eutectic in unchilled Sn 19. The resemblance to the
eutectic, also formed at the same temperature, of Sn 14 is very great, and we have
little doubt that this eutectic complex, formed in the solid alloys at a temperature of,

or a little below, 500°, contains the same two phases, « and 6, in all the alloys from
Sn 6 to Sn 20. Beyond Sn 20, even with a mere trace more tin, the eutectic
vanishes, and there is so little of it in Sn 20 that we are disposed to regard it as an
accident in that alloy, or as due to the fact that the alloys that we call Sn 20 may
have a slight deficit of tin in them. If so, there is considerable reason to regard the
8 substance of Sn 20 and of all the previous C’ eutectics as being the compound
Cu,Sn. In this case the compound is not present, at all events in crystalline form,
above the transformation curve, and is finally produced by crystallisation out of a solid
solution. On this view the transition from the condition of the alloy just above the
point D’ to that just below it must be compared to the conversion of a pure substance
from the liquid to the solid state, only that in the case of the alloy we are considering
both states are solid. The change, like that from a liquid to a solid, is an exothermic
one.

It is, of course, possible that the 6 material found in all the alloys from Sn 6 to
Sn 20 may be a series of solid solutions varying in composition throughout this range
