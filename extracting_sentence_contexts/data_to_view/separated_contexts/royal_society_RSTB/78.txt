In the Snakes, which are the most specialised branch of the Saurian stock, the
original position of the penes is ccenogenetically obscured, although still traceable. 3. The original duplicity of the “ unpaired” copulatory organ of the other Amniota
is still indicated by the nerve supply, the vascular supply, by the corpora cavernosa
s. crura penis, by the double penis and clitoris of certain Marsupials, like Didelphys,
and by the fact that in the Chelonia the peritoneal canals are continued far into the
lateral portions of the penis. 4. The completely divided right and left penes of the Lizards and Snakes are
supplied by the same nerves as are the copulatory organs in all the other Sauropida.
