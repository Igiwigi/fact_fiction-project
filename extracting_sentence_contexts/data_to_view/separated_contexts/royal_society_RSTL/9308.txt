For the purpose of this investigation it is necessary to express such quantities as

o:(Q), o.(Q) in terms of the groups distinguished by the signs of £, n, £ instead of

wu, v, w; and owing to the fact that in all the cases to be considered U?, V?, W? are
of the second order of small quantities compared with u?, v*, w* this may be done. For we may put

o:(Q)=${(EFV)Q}=${(E#V)Q}+${(&#0)Q}* . . . . (19)
o:.(Q)=2{(&FV)Q3=z{(&FV)Q3—zi(&#0)Q} . . . .
