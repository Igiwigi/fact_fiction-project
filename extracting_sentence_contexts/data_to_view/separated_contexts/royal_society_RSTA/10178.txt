Potential Gradient.—The daily course of the potential gradient varies greatly
according to the season of the year. For this reason five curves of the daily course

* The lowness of the two curves for wind strengths 0-1 and 1-2 during the first part of the winter is
due to the fact that, owing to the darkness at both the morning and evening observations then, it was
impossible to see if the smoke of the village was drifting towards my place of observation or not. Nor
was I quite aware then of the fact, which I found later, that with no wind the smoke of the village
extended in an almost invisible haze over the whole valley, out of which it could not get. This smoke
effect, of course, only acted when there was insufficient wind to drive the smoke away, and its effect is
not at all visible on the two curves with wind strength greater than two, i.¢., a steady breeze.
