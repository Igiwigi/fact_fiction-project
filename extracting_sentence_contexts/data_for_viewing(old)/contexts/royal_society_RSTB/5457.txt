460 G. R. DE BEER ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE SHREW.

plate broadens out in the anterior region forming a shelf overlying the cochlear capsule
on each side. This shelf is the lamina supracochlearis, and it is on to it that the alico-
chlear commissure is attached. In another whale, Megaptera, HontaMAn (1917) showed q
that the lamina supracochlearis arises quite independently of the cochlear capsule and
in continuity with the basal plate. In other mammals, the lamina supracochlearis seems
to have disappeared, and it is replaced by the cochlear capsule. ‘The alicochlear com-

missure growing backwards therefore becomes attached to the cochlear part of the
auditory capsule. ‘The loss of the lamina supracochlearis in these mammals must be ;
associated with the fact that the cochlear capsules have grown in beneath the lateral 4
edges of the basal plate, and the latter have become superfluous. The attachment of ;

the alicochlear commissure on to the cochlear capsule may therefore be explained as
due to the loss of the lamina supracochlearis and its replacement by the cochlear
capsule. ‘
‘Turning now to the relations of the suprafacial commissure, if, as just described, the
auditory capsule has grown inwards and substituted itself for the lateral edges of the
basal plate, and at the same time the brain-cavity has not decreased (on the contrary,
it has certainly increased) it is obvious that the side wall of the skull which is repre-
sented by the suprafacial commissure will no longer stand on the lateral edge of the
basal plate but on its usurper, the auditory capsule.
That this is the true explanation is rendered very probable by the conditions in
