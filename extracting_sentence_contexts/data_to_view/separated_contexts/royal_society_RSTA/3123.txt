Remark 1.4. In principle, we could have used an Evans function framework ([29], e.g.) to obtain
the stability results of theorems 1.2 and 1.3. In fact, (1.6) and (1.9) can be directly related to a
condition of the form €(4) =0, where €(A) is a—remarkably simple and very explicit—Evans-
function associated with the spectral stability problem. We decided not to pursue this direction
for the brevity and readability of the manuscript. Remark 1.5.
