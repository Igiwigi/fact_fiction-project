Constitution of the Nucleolus in Antedon. The approximately spherical form of the nucleolus and its steady growth, irrespective
of the facility with which it parts with the basic stain, indicate that the whole of
the nucleolus is formed of a ground substance continuous alike through the basophile
and acidophile regions. The fact that the occasional departures from the spherical form
are invariably produced by that portion of the nucleolar surface in contact with the
de-stained area (figs. 24, 49, 51, &c.), together with the fact that it is from this
region the nucleolar discharge invariably takes place, indicate that the capacity
for tenaciously retaining the basic stain is accompanied by a considerably firmer
consistency of this portion of the nucleolar substance. As the loss of this reaction
proceeds from within outwards, the outermost layers of the deeply basophile cortex
must possess a considerably firmer consistency than those lying further in. This
condition readily explains the entire absence of any indication of a discharge taking
place directly to the exterior from the vacuoles in the cortical region, however
peripherally they may be placed, and lends support to the assumption that the
vacuoles discharge instead into the more fluid substance of the faintly staining area,
an assumption which is still further suggested by the periodical discharge taking
place from the latter.
