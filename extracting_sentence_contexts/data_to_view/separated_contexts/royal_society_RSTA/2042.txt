In addition to short chains, there are also
individual particles in the sample volume. The influence of the magnetic field was insufficient
to involve all the particles in the process of structuring, despite the fact that condition fp/f > 1 is
definitely fulfilled. In fact, time #, was about 12h during the manufacture of the particular sample
with nickel microparticles patterned at H=10kA m7! and represented in figures 10c and 11a.

(c) Composites with thin long chain aggregates

Composites with long chains are samples in which the chain aggregates trend to overlap the
specimen volume from one side to the other. Long aggregates consist of both thin single chains
and several chains joined together, but their thickness does not significantly exceed the particle
size. There are also a number of shorter aggregates similar to chains in the samples presented
in ยง4b.
