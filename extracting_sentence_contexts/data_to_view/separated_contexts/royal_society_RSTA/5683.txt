In the figures, these
distributions tend to stabilize as n increases, which supports this conjecture. We denote by yz the limiting random probability measure on Z. To explain the observed fact
of typically large values of the quenched variance shown in figure 3a, one can think of two
possibilities. The first one corresponds to the situation when the random probability measure
u has finite variance, while in the second case the variance is infinite. Since fit is centred at the
point of maximum density, the behaviour of the second moment is not that different from that of
the variance.
