Lightning discharges occurred overhead in rapid succession during the period shown
by P and Q on the electrogram. These caused violent and very quick changes in the
record. In fact, they were so quick that it is difficult to count their number and some
left no impression on the photographic paper. The quick-run record obtained
for this thunderstorm enables us to distinguish the sudden displacement caused by each
lightning discharge and shows that there were in all about 150 such displacements
during the period. The extremely quick fluctuations in the portions LM and SR of
the electrogram are also due to lightning discharges.
