multiple forms of plasticity at excitatory synapses, so the
changes one can measure after a given manipulation will be
owing to a complex mixture of local and global, Hebbian
and homeostatic processes. As a consequence, the lack of
purely multiplicative scaling after a given manipulation
does not necessarily mean that synaptic scaling has not
occurred. As an addendum to this, experimental measures of
multiplicative scaling (generally based on miniature excitatory
postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude analysis) are rela-
tively insensitive to the possibility that a fraction of synapses
are unaffectedâ€”so even if scaling is observed, one cannot
rule out that some synapse types onto a postsynaptic neuron
are immune to synaptic scaling. In fact, it seems quite likely
that as more data emerge from in vivo systems where cell iden-
tity is better preserved than in the culture environment, we
will find that synaptic scaling is synapse-type specific rather
than find globally expressed across all synapse types. What
all of this says is that, to confidently assign a synaptic
change to any particular form of plasticity, one must use
some mixture of induction and expression characteristics
(phenotype), and molecular signatures that differentiate
between different forms of plasticity. It is rarely possible to
do this with complete confidence in the in vivo environment.
