in the next section, but assuming for the moment the results there obtained, the height-
gain analysis can be used to prepare a set of graphs for various wave-lengths, giving
the signal strength for 1 kW. radiated, against distance from the transmitter for various
heights of the receiver above the ground. Fig. 10 shows a typical set of curves drawn
for A= 10 m., ¢ = 5 and ¢ = 10-' e.m.u. Above the tangent plane and for distances
within about 100 km., where the first term of the diffraction formula no longer pre-
dominates, the curves have been calculated by the simple theory of a direct ray and
a reflected ray, using the reciprocal theorem, and taking into account the imperfect
reflexion and the curvature of the earth. The diffraction curves are then joined up to
these by eye, and the uncertainty in this region can only be one or two decibels.

The straight line portions of the curves show where the first term of the diffraction
theory is predominant, and the fact that they are all parallel shows that the height-
gain relation is independent of the distance from the transmitter. A complete set of
curves for A = 2 to 10 m. for land and sea has been published elsewhere (Eckersley 1937).

It may be noted here that there is a complete absence of an “optical range” at small
heights. The earth losses are so heavy, even close to the transmitter, that the curve
passes almost straight over into the diffraction curve. Even at greater heights, where
