In the eighteenth century, the
French physiocrats viewed land and agriculture as the source of wealth. In the 1960s, scientists
and economists began to focus on the joint application of exergy analysis and engineering
economics; in Europe, the approach was called exergo-economics; in the US it went by the name
thermo-economics [21]. In the 1980s, an approach emerged called BioPhysical economics, which
takes into consideration the fact that economic systems, like all natural systems, are governed
by thermodynamic laws and principles, including the MPP [45,46]. Like exergo-economics and
thermo-economics, BioPhysical economics seeks to better understand economic processes by
acknowledging the central role played by energy. In the process, it attempts to address many of
the problems with neoclassical economic theory.
