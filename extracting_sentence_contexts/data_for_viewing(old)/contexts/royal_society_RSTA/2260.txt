that one should only be interested in this question if one of the contexts c,c’ is the factual context.
A comparison of two counterfactual assignments, one might insist, is of no interest. I can see no
convincing justification for imposing this restriction. Using our example (2.4), if one meaningfully
contemplates a counterfactual value of RS when the measurements are factually made in context
c =2, one should also be able to consider counterfactual value of R}: after all, R} and R} are jointly
distributed, it may even be the case that one of them is uniquely determined by the other, e.g.
R} = —R}. But then, if one can speak of the value that R} would have had if one measured q = 1 in
context c = 1 instead of measuring q = 2 in context c = 2, then one can also speak of what the value
of RE would have been if the same q = 1 were measured in context c = 3. And the requirement that
the assignment of values should only depend on content would then dictate that R? be assigned
the same value as R}.

The picture we arrive at now is: irrespective of what factual measurements are made, all
random variables are assigned values, and we ask whether this can be done so that any two Ri
and RE be assigned the same value. Assume that this is possible, i.e. the system is non-contextual
in the counterfactual sense. Then Ri and Ri, being always equal to each other, are jointly
distributed. By the agglutinativity of the relation of being jointly distributed, this means that all
random variables in the system are jointly distributed. This is obvious in our example, where the
identity requirement across contexts together with the joint distributions within contexts yields
the following graph of pairwise jointly distributed random variables:
