On all three plots, 9, 11-1, and 11-2, there has been either no leguminous herbage
found, or only a small fraction of 1 per cent. of it.

The most prominent species belonging to the © miscellaneous ” orders is the Jtumes
acetosa, which, however, seems to be going down on all, but the mosb on the plots 11.
Next in order of prevalence are Conopodium denudatum and Achilles millefolium,
both of which are decreasing, and on the plots 11 have nearly disappeared.

Thus, with the combination of mineral manures and ammonia-salts, the greater the
quantity of the latter the more nearly does the produce become exclusively gramineons,
and the more does it, consist of a few of the most freely-growing grasses. These, too,
take possession of the ground yery much in tufts or patches, and grow coarse, strong
seed-stems, and broad, flaggy, dark-green leaves. The herbage is, in fact, very coarse,
often laid, and dead at the bottom before it is ripe; indeed, it generally mabures

irregularly and imperfectly, yielding hay of low quality. Though, if the grass were
fed off young, or cut green for feeding, it would probably be fairly good food.

Coincidently with these botanical and other characteristics of the herbage grown by
mineral manures and ammonia-salts, we have, as already stated, an abnormally high
percentage of nitrogen in the produce when an excessive amount of it is supplied in
the manure. There is also a s0mewhat high percentage of mineral matter in the dry
