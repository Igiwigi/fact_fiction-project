people, the fact that the weather is chaotic seemed to imply that it is hopeless to
try to forecast it. However, a fundamental property of any chaotic system is that
the degree to which it is predictable is itself a function of the initial state;
forecasts from some initial states can be very predictable, even though the
system as a whole is chaotic.

To exploit this property of weather as a chaotic dynamical system, methods
based on ensemble forecasting have been developed to try to predict when the
weather is predictable and when it is unpredictable. The method is conceptually
simple: an ensemble is a collection of forecasts made from almost, but not quite,
identical initial conditions. The spread among members of the ensemble gives an
estimate of flow-dependent predictability.
