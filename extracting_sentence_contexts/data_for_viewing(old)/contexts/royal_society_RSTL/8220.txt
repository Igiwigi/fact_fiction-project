The appearance of a transverse section is corroborative of the view here taken of the |
production of the bright bands; for in this case the dots are seen sufficiently close |
together for the optical effect produced upon the ground-substance by any one of them
to be merged into that of the neighbouring ones, 80 that the intermediate 8ubstance
appears uniformly bright.

The close relation subsisting between the rows of rod-heads and their bright borders
is also seen when a muscle contracts, the movements of the one proceeding pari passu |
with those of the other. |

A further indication that the whole of the ground-substance is of the same nature is
to be found in the fact that, as will immediately be shown, it exhibits towards polarized
light a similar behaviour throughout.

In the state of rest this ground-substance pervades the whole muscular fibre ; in con- |

* This appearance occurs both when the globules are in focus and also when they are slightly out of the focus ; |
the surrounding brightness may be sometimes een to be pretty sharply bounded by a margin, which is dimmer
than the rest of the field. I am inclined to believe this to be an effect due to the interference between the
rays of light which are reflected from the surface of the globule and those which are refracted through its
substance. Its bearing upon certain appearances 8ometimes observed in muscular fibres will be noticed
later on.
