and mode matching parameter, the intensity can reach extraordinarily high values in the beam if

waist (easily larger than 10Â°Wm~? for 1mW of incident power), thus leading to nonlinear
effects, on the one hand, and local heating of the absorbing gas, on the other hand. This latter
phenomenon, in particular, may lead to a measurable positive shift in the retrieval of the Doppler
width.

4. The carbon dioxide experiment

Figure 1 also indicates that the use of CO2 at 24m wavelength (whose lines belong to the
v1 + 2v2 + v3 combination band) may be advantageous, the A-ratios being larger than those of
ammonia and water. In fact, at a pressure of approximately 100 Pa, this ratio amounts to about
40, which, in conjunction with the fact that collisions are much less effective (the molecule
being non-polar), explains the success of the experiment that immediately followed the first DBT
implementation [54]. In that experiment, the shape of the well isolated R(12) component was
probed at different temperatures, between the TPW and the gallium melting point (302.9146 K),
by using an ECDL. This spectral line was also selected by researchers at the PTB-Braunschweig,
for laser-spectroscopy-based measurement of the amount of substance fraction of CO) in Np
[55]. Figure 3 shows an example of repeated determinations of the gas temperature, as retrieved
at a pressure of about 100Pa from the analysis of 50 spectra by means of a Voigt profile; the
gas cell was temperature stabilized at 298.68(1) K, which was measured by using a standard
platinum-resistance thermometer. The histogram on the right side shows that the distribution
is Gaussian. The mean value is 298.77 K, with a standard deviation of the mean of 0.13K, in
a satisfactory agreement with the set point [54]. The use of the Voigt profile can be justified
by the fact that the mean free-path of the molecules, L is much larger than 4/27. From the
