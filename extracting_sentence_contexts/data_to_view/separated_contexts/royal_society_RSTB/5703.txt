It never developed with one stipule only (see Table III). In the
other thirteen experiments, I, failed to develop, although in six of them, at least half of
its presumptive stipular areas was included in the isolated piece. The fact that I,
failed to arise in these six experiments is remarkable and suggests that it may not have
been determined at the time when it was isolated, and that determination may only
take place in tissues that are in direct organic continuity with the growing-point. But
clearly much more evidence is needed on the point. Part 4.â€”ConcLUSIONS.
