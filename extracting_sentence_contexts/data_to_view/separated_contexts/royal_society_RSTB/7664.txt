Cells of type d in the basal layer (clear cells)

Clear cells in the basal layer of the epidermis have been described and figured by
a number of authors; Masson (19480), Billingham (1948) and Zimmermann & Cornbleet
(1948) believe that they represent the perikarya of melanocytes. Clear cells that live up to
their name are visible only in weakly pigmented skins, though they are not visible in the
white skin areas of recessively spotted rats (Taylor 1949) or guinea-pigs. ‘They are peculiarly
vulnerable to fixation artifacts, notably the collapse of the cytoplasm around the nucleus
to leave an empty space, but in our experience Altmann’s fixative (osmium tetroxide-
potassium dichromate) can be relied on for good preservation. Clear cells are distinguished from Malpighian cells by the abundance of their cytoplasm
and by the fact that the cytoplasm is optically almost clear and not basiphilic; unlike
Malpighian cells, they are not united to their neighbours by structures having the
appearance of cytoplasmic bridges (figure 8, plate 9). The grounds upon which they
have been assumed to represent the perikarya of melanocytes are (a) a correspondence of
position and, by rough computations, number; and (b) the fact that clear processes can
sometimes be seen to issue from them and pass between neighbouring Malpighian cells.
(In orthodox vertical sections, these processes cannot be traced very far, and as a general
rule only their proximal stumps can be distinguished.) ‘That this plausible interpretation
