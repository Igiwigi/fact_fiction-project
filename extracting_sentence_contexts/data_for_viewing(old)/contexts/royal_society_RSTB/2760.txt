The amount of pigment formed in the sheep's sexual season depends upon two
factors ; firstly, upon the extent to which extravasation has occurred in the procestrous
periods,* and, secondly, upon the quantity of blood retained in the stroma (or, con-
versely, upon the extent or existence of bleeding into the uterine cavity). Fig. 6
(Plate 7) represents part of a section through the mucosa of a sheep killed towards
the end of the sexual season, #.e., a sheep that had passed through several recurrent
dicestrous cycles. The animal was killed four days after cestrus. The large quantity

of pigment formed was no doubt derived from blood which had been extravasated

* The quantity of pigment formed must also, of course, depend upon the number of procestrous periods,
This may be inferred from the facts stated below in the same paragraph.

during the several procestrous periods, and not merely during the most recent of the
series. - Derivatives of blood corpuscles, associated with wandering cells, by which
they were apparently in process of being taken up, and dating from the last
procestrum, were still recognisable, Elsewhere in the same section heematoidin crystals
were found to occur,
