displacement increases T by 5T; this increase must come from some source; as th
supposed to be no dissipation it must come ultimately from the energy of the mater
system. During the displacement the electromotive system is at each mome
sensibly in an equilibrium condition, so that there is practically no interaction betwe

actions, the displacement alters the mechanical energy of the system by an amu

from the effects of mixed kinetic reactions. In the discussion in MAXWELt’s “Treatise
§ 570, this idea of action and reaction between two interlocked systems, the electr
motive one and the mechanical one, has in the end to be introduced to obtain
proper sign for the mechanical force. The energy T is electro-kinetic solely ;
energy of the material system is included in it.
