four being well illuminated and the other four in shade. It would, therefore, seem, that
the relation between leaf size and stomatal frequency, which is so pronounced when we
compare leaves of the same node, may be entirely masked under humid conditions.
This is borne out by examination of Mercurialis leaves from plants growing in very damp
air under bell-jars. Since the different parts of the plant will naturally be growing
under differing conditions of humidity it will be convenient to consider next the relation
which stomatal frequency exhibits to the varying positions in which the leaf is borne
upon the plant.

2.—Stomatal frequency in relation to the position of the leaf upon the plant.

Yarp, in his study of Ulmaria palustris (‘ Ann. Bot.,’ vol. XXVI, p. 826, 1912), drew
attention to the fact that there appeared to be a regular increase in the number of stomata
per unit area as one passed from, the basal to the apical leaves, and raised the question
as to whether the phenomenon might not be a general one. Inasmuch as the leaves
of most plants tend to become smaller as one passes from the base to the apex, it is

apparent that the phenomenon may be but an expression of the negative correlation
dealt with in the preceding section, but, before considering this aspect, we may enquire
as to whether this gradient of stomatal frequency is a general one or not.

Woodland grasses offer a suitable field of enquiry owing to the ease with which leaves
