This viewpoint seems completely in line with Bohr’s view [34]: ‘Physics is to be regarded not
so much as the study of something a priori given, but rather as the development of methods of
ordering and surveying human experience. In this respect, our task must be to account for such
experience in a manner independent of individual subjective judgment and therefore objective in
the sense that it can be unambiguously communicated in ordinary human language.’ This, in our
opinion, is exactly what the LI approach allows us to do. The extraordinary descriptive power of
quantum theory then follows from the fact that it is plausible reasoning, that is common sense,
applied to robust experiments. From our LI derivations of some of the most basic equations of quantum theory, it follows
that the latter describes only robust experiments. This is best illustrated by comparing the (high)
accuracy by which quantum theory predicts, say, the ratios of the wavelengths of the Balmer
absorption/emission lines of hydrogen [57] with the comparably low accuracy of say EPRB
experiments that purport to provide evidence for the singlet state of two spin-5 particles [39,50].
