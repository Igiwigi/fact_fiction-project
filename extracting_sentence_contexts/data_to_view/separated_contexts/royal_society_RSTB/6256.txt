In all the yolk is sufficiently concentrated to produce a very slow rate
of cleavage and an extremely epibolic type of gastrulation. Concerning the relative
amount of yolk, all that can be said with confidence is that it is greater in the egg of
Diplosoma than in the others. At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation
is less marked in Didemnum than in the rest suggests that the yolk is less concentrated
toward the vegetative pole. On this basis, namely, that there is proportionately
more yolk in the egg of Diplosoma and a somewhat even distribution of yolk in the
Didemnum egg, the differences in course of development may be explained. Trididem-
num and Polysyncraton eggs differ apparently merely in size.
