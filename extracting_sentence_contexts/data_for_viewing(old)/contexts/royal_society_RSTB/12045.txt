where the IC; could not be calculated due to the shape of
the fitted curve, yet some data analysis software will attempt
to calculate an ICs» that results in an unrealistic value.

5. Assessing drug response in coculture systems

Coculturing cancer cells with stromal cells (e.g. cancer-associ-
ated fibroblasts, pericytes or adipocytes) has been shown to
drastically alter drug response, ranging from promoting
drug resistance to increasing drug sensitivity [25,40—44].
Furthermore, multicellular cocultures may be more physio-
logically relevant than monocultures, either in 2D or 3D, as
they can account for tissue-level interactions. In fact, it was
