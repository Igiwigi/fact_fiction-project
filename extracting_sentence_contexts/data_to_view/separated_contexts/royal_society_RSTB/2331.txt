The
latter was itself regarded by Mr. Lomax as belonging to Cardiocarpon. The
sporangia borne on the strobilus, however, differed conspicuously from the “seeds ”
of Wixir1aMson’s Cardiocarpon, in the fact that they were without any integument,
a character of essential importance, on which the identification of W1LLIAMson’s

specimens as seeds to a great extent depends. Thus, in spite of the close agreement
in detail between the nucellus of the one and the sporangium of the other, and
though realising the possibility that an integument might grow up, at a later stage,
around the sporangium, I was for a long time unwilling to draw the startling con-
clusion that a Lepidostrobus (for such the new cone essentially was) bore seeds,
identical with a “ Cardiocarpon.” Other specimens, received during 1898-1899,
did not remove this initial difficulty, and it was not till January 22nd, 1900, that I
received what could be accepted as finally convincing evidence. This was afforded

* Quite different, however, as will be shown below, from the true Cardiocarpon anomalum of
CARRUTHERS.
