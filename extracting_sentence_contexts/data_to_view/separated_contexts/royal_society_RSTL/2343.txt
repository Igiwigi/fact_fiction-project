378 MR. RITCHIE'S EXPERIMENTS ON ELECTRIC CONDUCTION. flow from B : as the iron cools, sparks will begin to appear between C and its
ball, and in a 8hort time the current will cease entirely from B, and the whole
will now strike off from C.

As the ball B was at a considerable distance from E, its temperature re-
mained uniform : we are therefore led to the conchusion that the electric fluid
finds an easier passage along hot than cold iron; or, to use the ordinary
language of the science, iron when red hot is a better conductor of electricity
than when cold. Whether the cause of this be found in the diminished attraction which hot
iron has for the electric fluid, in the diminished pressure of the ambient air, or
in both causes combined, is a question which has not yet been solved ; but
whatever be the canse, the fact is certain, though at complete variance with
our preconceived notions on the subject, and even with the results of former
experiments. -
