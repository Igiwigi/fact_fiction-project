+ Such arguments are based upon the assumption that the force in play between
Sieighbouring molecules is attractive ab all distances. The force exerted on a molecule
y its neighbours must no doubt be, on the whole, attractive, and if the film is thin
nough the surface tension musb diminish. Tb is, however, usual, in dealing with other
roblems in molecular mechanics, to assume the existence of repulsiye forces acting at
All events between certain limits as to distance. We need only refer to the well-
Znown instance of some forms of the dynamical theory of gases, and to the fact that

e most recent theory of the nature of matter lately put forward by Professor
