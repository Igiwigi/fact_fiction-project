metals and alloys, and as Professor Rosrrrs-AusTEN offered to place his laborate
and appliances at my disposal, and to aid me by advice, the opportunity
conducting the new experiments was gladly accepted.

The first experiments were made by placing the thermo-couple between the
welding faces of bars heated in an ordinary smith’s fire. The wires of the thern
couple were carried from the smith’s shop to the pyrometer in the laboratory, bi
signalling was necessary to ensure the taking of the photographic record of th
temperature at the exact moment the smith applied pressure, and it soon beca
evident that the arrangement was awkward. ‘The results were far from bei
uniform, although on several occasions a distinct fall of temperature was appare
when welding was effected, which encouraged the expectation that with a more
perfect system of work the true facts of the case would be revealed.

After full consideration it was decided that the only satisfactory way to procee
would be to use the electric welding apparatus of THompson Houston with alterna'
ing currents. The Electric Welding Company readily put one of their admirab
appliances and a suitable dynamo at my disposal ; the manager, Mr. ARMSTRONG, af
the electrician, Mr. Rex», assisted in installing it at the Mint, and helped in every
way to make the arrangement effective. By the kindness of Mr. R. A. Hrtx, Supe
intendent of the Operative Department, the composite alternating dynamo was driven
from the Mint engines, and the conductors from the dynamo were carried over
intervening buildings to Professor Roperts-AustEn’s laboratory, where they were
connected to the electric welder.
