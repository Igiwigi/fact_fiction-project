Pollard [52] considered Gerstner waves in the presence of rotation and found that,
although the dispersion relation of such waves is only slightly affected by rotation, their time-
averaged Lagrangian velocity is zero, and inertial oscillations are generated in agreement with
Ursell & Deacon [50] and Hasselmann [51]. Very recently, Constantin & Monismith [53] have
reconsidered the solution by Pollard [52], but in the presence of a depth-invariant mean current,
identification of an additional type of wave is made possible by the presence of the current that
Constantin & Monismith [53] term an ‘inertial Gerstner wave’. In fact, the so-called Hasselmann force [51] corresponds to the strong rotation limit of the
vortex force identified in the seminal paper by Craik & Leibovich [54] that arises from interaction
of the wave velocity field with the mean vorticity field. In the Craik-Leibovich (CL) momentum

Coriolis forces), Stokes drift is responsible for three effects, the Coriolis-Stokes force, the Stokes
correction to pressure and the vortex force: mea)
