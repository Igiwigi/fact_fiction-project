intermediate state.

A model in which the membrane goes through a hemifusion intermediate is often used to
describe scission in endocytosis, as it does not involve the opening of large pores, which would
presumably leak out the vesicle material [73]. According to theoretical predictions, the total
free energy of a membrane connected to a spherical vesicle—altogether adopting a catenoid
shape—strongly increases as the aperture between the neck and the vesicle tightens. Once the
aperture radius falls below a critical value, the membrane bilayers fuse. The energy of the
separated membranes is always lower than the hemifusion energy, therefore upon fusion, scission
spontaneously occurs. It was found that the critical aperture radius increases with the vesicle size,
having an approximate radius of 5nm for a 40-nm wide vesicle bud [74]. Of note, the results of
this model are frequently quoted as stating that the neck radius needs to collapse to 3nm to
reach the hemifusion state. In fact, the calculations showed that for a 40-nm-wide bud the neck
radius is closer to Ineck = "aperture /Tvesicle = 1.3nm. This result is sensitive to the bilayer thickness,
spontaneous curvature and the bending moduli of the membrane, which depend on the lipid
composition and the bound protein.

Another way of rupturing membranes is by applying tension. For a pure lipid membrane, the
tension at which the membrane ruptures (the so-called lysis tension) is very high (1-30 mNm-!)
and it largely depends on composition [75,76]. When applying a rapid tension ramp, rupture is a
consequence of nucleating defects in the membrane. Apparently, a model based on experimental
data predicts very small size rupture pores (approx. 1 nm width) with lifetimes of approximately
