Young children are noisy, variable,
unfocused, unpredictable and impulsive. They lack ‘executive
function’ abilities and capacities for focused and directed
attention and are notoriously bad at long-term planning
and deferred gratification [61,62]. In fact, almost by defi-
nition, young children cannot even take care of themselves
(this is what immaturity means). In addition to being effective learners in general, human
children are especially good at exploratory ‘active learning’
that involves the pursuit of information about the world. A new wave of empirical research shows that toddlers and
preschoolers explore the world and collect new information
in spontaneous, systematic and rational ways ([63-68]; see


[69] for a review).
