That aldoxime cannot be considered a cardiac poison is shown by the fact that the
perfusion of this strong solution was continued three hours, and at the end of that
time the heart was still beating fairly well (fig. 17). At the end of two hours the
perfusion of the drug was suspended and the normal fluid continued, with the result
that the normal beat was almost restored (fig. 15). The solution of aldoxime was
again perfused and caused an immediate return of the accelerated rhythm and
