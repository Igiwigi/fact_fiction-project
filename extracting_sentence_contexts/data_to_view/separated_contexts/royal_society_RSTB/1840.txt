Two characteristics of the nerve-response should be mentioned at this stage, as
being probably significant of a relative simplicity of this form of excitable matter, a
simplicity that may be regarded as rendering nerve the most favourable among
living tissues for the study of modifications by chemical reagents. These are :—

(1). The fact that in nerve the relation between magnitude of stimulus and magni-
tude of electrical effect is arithmetical within at least a considerable range, exceeding
what, judged by the muscular response, may be termed the “ physiological ” range. *

(2). The fact just alluded to that the electrical effect increases with increasing
magnitude of stimulus much beyond the physiological maximum effect as gauged by
muscle.
