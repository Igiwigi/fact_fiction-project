ity [21,56,58,64]. Together, these studies suggest some evidence
for linear changes in genomic mechanisms underpinning the
different stages of the major transition to superorganismality,
involving incremental changes in gene regulation, co-option of
deeply conserved genes, and expansions of ancient gene
families across different levels of social complexity (figure 2b).

(b) Step-wise evolution: evidence of nonlinear changes

in molecular processes
Recent literature suggests that the scale of the mutation (e.g. a
‘small’ single point mutation versus a ‘large’ change such as
an inversion of a chromosomal segment) is in fact linked to
the scale of the expected phenotypic effect [48,49]. That is,
large-scale genetic changes (e.g. those that involve whole
genome duplication, gene duplication, changes in chromoso-
mal arrangement, deletion or insertion of large stretches of
DNA [67], or transposable element insertion into gene regulat-
ory networks [68]) are more likely to have large-scale (often
detrimental) consequences on organismal function. Such non-
linear changes in the molecular processes associated with
sociality have recently been identified (e.g. supergenes; topolo-
gically associated domains), and several studies suggest that
such large-scale genomic changes can result in major phenoty-
pic changes that can sometimes be highly adaptive. A growing
