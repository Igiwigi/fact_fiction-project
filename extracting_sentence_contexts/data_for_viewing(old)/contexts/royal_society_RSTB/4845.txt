B. Adult Lung.—The cultures on which these observations are based were derived
from adult etherized cats and rabbits. The minimum duration of culture was 5 hours,
the maximum 8 days. Control fragments of lung show capillary congestion and some
desquamation of the alveolar epithelium, in addition to the collapse which always occurs
in adult lung unless special precautions are taken to prevent it. The epithelial
catarrh is ascribable to the irritant effect of the ether.

(i) The Cicatricial Epithelium.—The account already given (pp. 377 and 378) of the
formation of the cicatricial epithelium in foetal lung is almost entirely applicable
to its behaviour in cultures of adult lung. Such a culture is depicted in Plate 16,
fig. 6.

Owing to the fact that all the bronchi of adult lung (excepting, of course, the terminal
bronchioles) are ciliated, whereas in foetal lung only the largest bronchi are ciliated, the
degree of “ dedifferentiation ” of the bronchial and cicatricial epithelia in adult lung is
greater than in foetal lung. The ciliated columnar epithelial cell is obviously more
highly specialized, in structure and in function, than its non-ciliated rather cubical

precursor. Hence its degree of dedifferentiation is greater in its transformation into the
polymorphic cell of the cicatricial epithelium.

(ii) The Alveolar Epithelium.—Cultures examined 5 hours after implantation show
