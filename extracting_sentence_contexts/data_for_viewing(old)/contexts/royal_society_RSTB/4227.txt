on the second, which has gained rather less than 10 mm. on the third sowing. The
third has gained more than 10 mm. on the fourth, while the fifth is 15-20 mm.
taller than the sixth. Further, we see from the note on the first sowing, that the
internodes in this one, at least, were actually shorter than those in the second sowing.

Moreover, as the seedling increases in height, the length of the growing zone of
the stem increases, so that, other things being equal, older seedlings should elongate
more in the same time. Here, on the contrary, the older the seedling the less its
elongation.

It may be mentioned here that there would seem to be a real distinction between
the development of nodes and the extension of internodes. To it is to be ascribed
the fact that the isophytic line for “ first flower ” does not run parallel in fig. 1 to the
isophytic line for “height, 30 cm.” It may be well to add that the reason is
probably of the nature of what we have called “ pre-determination,” to be further
discussed in Part III; the differentiation of the nodes in the bud is conditioned by
earlier environment than that which determines the fluctuation in internode length,
and the flowering branches can only arise at pre-formed nodes.

In general terms, however, it is obvious that the elongation rate of the earlier
sowings must have been slower than that of later sowings, since the latest sowings
attained to any given height in a shorter time than their predecessors (fig. 1).

As the elongation rate slows down with old age, these differences are obliterated,
and by the end of July all sowings are of approximately equal height.
