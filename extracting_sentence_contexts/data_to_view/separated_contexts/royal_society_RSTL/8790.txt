The proportion of carbon
= was slightly lowerin the R. LL. G, than in the pebble powder ; and this fact is in harmony
= with the proportion by weight which the total gaseons constituents bear to the solid
ie in the products obtained with the two powders, it being somewhat the highest, in
= most instances, in the case of the pebble powder. The proportion of carbonic oxide is
2 often rather higher in the gas obtained from the pebble powder than in that furnished
= by the R. L.
