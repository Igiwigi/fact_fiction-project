Like the latter unequivocal congeners of
the till existing Nautilus, the Belemnites are distributed through a vast series of the
secondary rocks from the epoch of the muschelkalk, when they seem first to have
been introduced into the old ocean of this planet, up to the Maestricht chalk, when
they finally perished. No tossil shell has more exercised the ingenuity and research of the interpreters of
ancient Nature, or has given rise to 80 many conflicting opinions as to the affinities
of its animal constructor, than the Belemnite : but the specimens from the Oxford
clay near Christian-Malford, in Wiltshire, liberally presented by the Marquis of NorTa-
AMPTON, P.R.S., SamutL Pract PraTT, E8q., F.R.S., and WiLLtam Jonn Broperiy, Esq.,
F.R.S., to the Royal College of Surgeons, leave no reasonable ground for further
hesitation or scepticism on the subject, since they display in a truly marvellous manner,
those soft and seemingly most perishable parts of the animal which are essential to
convey a true idea of its living form. It must, however, be premised in vindication of the fruitful principle of physiolo-
gical correlations, established by Cuvisr as the key to the interpretation of fossil
remains, that, for some years prior to this discovery, there had heen obtained suffi-
cient evidence of the organization of the Belemnite, to determine both its ordinal
and family affinities ; but, as the value of this evidence failed to be appreciated by
80me experienced palzontologists, from want of sufficient knowledge of, or faith in,
the laws of the interdependencies of the characteristic parts of 'the Cephalopodal
organization, the additional facts afforded by the well-preserved specimens from the
Oxford clay are most acceptable and yaluable. In the compound shell of these specimens the following parts are recogni-
zable —

1st. The terminal spathose body called the © guard,” sheath or rostrum*, resembling
the head of a dart or javelin, whence the name Belemnite originally given to this part
