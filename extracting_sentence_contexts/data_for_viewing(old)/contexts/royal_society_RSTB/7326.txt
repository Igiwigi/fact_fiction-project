each possessing one of these maxima. In the light of Granitâ€™s researches, using micro-
electrodes, the latter is the more likely, but it is possible that the light stimulus might fall not
ona modulator with a sharp spectral response, but on a dominator with a relatively wide one.

If in fact three different cones are receiving stimulation, each possessing a single maxi-
mum, then it should be possible to alter the respective heights of these maxima by shifting
the image by small amounts on the retina, because this should increase the light on one or
both of the other cones. In this way, by shifting the fixation light by small amounts,
adjustment could be made until the purest effect was obtained. Thus, having investigated
the properties of one cone, by moving the fixation mark, the properties of a neighbouring
cone could be similarly investigated. At the same time that spectral analysis discloses the
properties of the cones the positions of the fixation light on the plotting-board should give
a clue as to the relative positions of these receptors, in respect of one another, in the fovea.

(139) The interconnexion of the retinal cones

According to Polyak (1941) more than one retinal receptor may be connected with one
