The spiral fibres are often very fine, and are con-
-2 nected together here and there. Sometimes several unite to form one very fine fibre,
E which can be followed for some distance upon, and very close to, the outer part of a
5 5 wide dark-bordered fibre. But I have many specimens in which both straight and spiral
Z fibres are exceedingly thin and of equal diameter, others in which the straight is much
Z thicker than the spiral fibre, and a few in which the diameter of the spiral fibre or fibres
E is even greater than that of the straight fibre.
& - Thave traced the spiral fibres continuous with @ dark-bordered fibre in several instances.
3 A very conclusive specimen showing this fact is represented in Plate XXXIIL. fig. 1, in
S which both straight and spiral fibre were continuous with dark-bordered fibres; als in
E fig. 19, in which the connexion between the spiral fibre and the dark-bordered fibre is
a represented.

© 80 that, with regard to the fibres connected with these ganglion-cells in the frog, it
may be remarked—

1. That in 8ome instances very fine fibres, not more than the Fobooth of an inch in
diameter, are alone continuous with both the straight and spiral fibres of the ganglion-
cell.

2. That a dark-bordered fibre may be traced to the ganglion-cell as the straight fibre,
while the spiral fibres are continued on as very fine fibres.
