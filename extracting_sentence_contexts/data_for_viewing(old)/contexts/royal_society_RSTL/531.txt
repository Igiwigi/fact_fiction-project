glass vessel, during agitation, was carefully guarded from the
warmth of the hand. The agitation was continued, till it ap-
peared, by the scale, to produce no further effect ; and, in the
absorption of difficultly condensible gases, was repeated at inter-
vals, during a space of from twelve to twenty-four hours.
Alterations of the barometer were always observed; and the re-'
siduary gas measured, or estimated, at a pressure of 29 inches,

1. Absorption of Carbonic Acid Gas by Water,

That the temperature of water influences the proportion of
carbonic acid which it is capable of absorbing, is already known
as a general fact;* but the exact amount of this influence has
not, I believe, been hitherto ascertained. In the course of a
s8eries of experiments to determine it with precision, I was
surprised by obtaining results which differed considerably from
each other, at the same temperature of the gas and water;
when both were, in different experiments, of like purity ; and
when the barometer had the same elevation. Of the cause of
these variations I was not aware, till my friend Mr. Da.ToN
suggested, that they probably depended on the variable amount
of the residues ; and, on repeating the experiments, with different
proportions between the gas and the water, this suggestion was
fully confirmed. Thus, when two measures of carbonic acid gas
were agitated with one measure of water, the absorption was:
