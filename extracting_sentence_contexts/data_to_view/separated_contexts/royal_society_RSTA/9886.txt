Here again it will be seen, also, that the differences between
corresponding bands in solution and vapour spectra respectively, as was shown on
p- 519, amount to from 10 to 16 Angstrom Units, which represent the shift towards
the visible spectrum of different bands measured in solutions. Summary and Conclusions. The variations in the vapour spectra at different temperatures and pressures may
be explained by the fact that there are two kinds of absorption which are sharply.
defined and may be differentiated ; these are distinguished by the terms general and
selective absorption. First, by rise of temperature, the general absorption is

broadened and extended towards the less refrangible rays, the effect of which is to
cause not only the narrow absorption bands but also the emission spectrum of
metallic lines and diffused rays to become obscured, while the feeble narrow bands
become strong and increase in number in that part of the spectrum which is
unaffected by the general absorption. By reduction of pressure, temperature being
constant, the general absorption is decreased, so that, consequent upon a diminution
in the quantity of substance under observation in the tube, the narrow absorption
bands become more numerous, but neither by rise of temperature nor reduction of
pressure is the position of these bands altered.
