A single charged spheroid at the origin (O,) gives a potential
proportional to q, (¢) at external points, so that the first approximation to the total
external potential of the two spheroids, when equally charged, is

V = qo(S) + Go(8')

(the actual charge being omitted for convenience). ELECTRIFICATION OF TWO PARALLEL CIRCULAR DISCS. 319

The general exact expression must be of the type

V = go(%) +40(8)-+ Stu {Palu) au(%)+(—PPale’)an(2)} (0)

where a, is a function of c, by reason of symmetry. ‘The potential must be constant over
both spheroids, and already has the requisite behaviour at infinity. The factor (—)"
compensates for the fact that the similarly charged contiguous surfaces of the spheroids
are not in corresponding positions with respect to the origin. A harmonic series given
by one spheroid corresponds to a series for the other with P,, (u) replaced, not by P,, (u’),
but by P,, (— pz’) or (—)" P, (v’). The expression above is appropriate for the region
outside, on the positive side of the z-axis.
