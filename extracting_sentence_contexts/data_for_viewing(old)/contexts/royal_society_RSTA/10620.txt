PROFESSOR K. PEARSON ON THE INFLUENCE OF NATURAL

(1.) Introductory. On the Influence of Selection upon Correlation.

‘Ar an earlier stage in the development of the semecea theory of evolution ¥
was suggested that the coefficient of correlation (Garon 8 function) might be fount
constant for all races of the same species—in fact, 1t was considered p »ssible that this
coeflicient might be the long-sought-for criterion of identity in species. Professor
Wepoy, following up this suggestion of Mr. Gauron’s, then made the elaborate
series of measurements on crabs with which his name will always be closely associated.
To a first approximation these researches seemed to confirm the possibility of
Gaxton’s function being a true criterion of species. When, however, a finer _
mathematical test was applied to Professor WxLDoN’s observations as well as to
other statistical series for organs in man,* it became clear that the coefficient of
correlation varied from local race to local race, and could not be used as a criterion
of species. A slight investigation undertaken in the summer of 1896 convinced me
that the coefficient of correlation between any two organs, is just as much peculiar and
characteristic of a local race as the means and variations of those organs. In fact,
if local races be the outcome of natural selection, then their coefficients of correlation
