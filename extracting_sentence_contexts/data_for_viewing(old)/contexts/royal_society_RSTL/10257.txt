and Elasmobranchii might at firs sight be taken as a conclusive argument, in fa:
of Gorre's view, that the ribs of Elasmobranchii are not homologous with those
Ganoidei. This view is mainly supported by two facts :—

(1) In the firsb place, the ribs in Elasmobranchii do not at first 8ight appear to
serially homologous with the ventral parts of the hazmal arches of the tail, but
rather seem to be lateral offshoots of the hzemal processes, while the hemal arches
the tail appear to be completed by the coalescence of independent ventral prolongati
of the h:emal processes.

(2) In the second place, the position of the ribs is different in the two groups.
Elasmobranchii they are situated between the dorso-lateral and ventro-lateral m
(woodeut, fig. 1, 7b.), while in Lepidosteus and other Ganoids they immediately
the body-cavity.
