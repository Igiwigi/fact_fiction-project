These stereotyped autoantibody
responses could arise from the mechanism of tolerance
escape described above for VH4-34-encoded cold-agglutinins
(figure 1c). Alternatively, certain B-cell subpopulations that
have stereotyped BCRs (figure 1a) may be more prone to
cause autoimmune diseases. Current research efforts are directed at identifying the
particular epitopes of autoimmune stereotyped B cells or
exploiting the fact that these cells have structurally unique
surface immunoglobulins. These cells, when causing pathol-
ogy, make an attractive potential target for therapy because
of their conserved nature. It may be possible to reduce path-
ology with anti-idiotypic antibodies used to deplete the
offending cells in a specific manner.
