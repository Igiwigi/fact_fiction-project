It has been shown on p. 543 that the value of ® is of the same order of magnitude
as }¢°/¢, where ¢ is the charge on an ion and € is the radius of a molecule ; it is
therefore also of the same order of magnitude as the energy set free when two ions of
opposite sign re-combine, and as the work required to produce an ion by collision. Theoretical considerations, in conjunction with the experimental results, render it
probable that may be represented very approximately as a linear function of the

temperature, whilst the numbers given on p. 544 show that the temperature coefficient
of @ is of the same order of magnitude as the coeflicient of linear expansion of the
corresponding solid conductor. These facts render it probable that ® is a function of the size and distance apart of
the molecules of which the conductor consists. If we consider ¢ in the formula
®=$¢/Cas the distance apart of the centres of the molecules in the solid state, it
will be proportional to the cube root of the atomic volume. We should therefore
expect the work done by a corpuscle in passing through the surface layer of different
metals to be approximately equal to a constant divided by the cube root of the
atomic volume.
