direction the results with Bomarea are of special interest, as they tend to give weight
to the view thab my experiments have led me to adopt, viz. : that a well defined blue
coloration, after the action of Chlor. Zine Tod. and picric-HorMaxx's-blue, points to
the presence of protoplasmic threads in the cell-wall.

Professor STRASBURGER * states, in the case of the endosperm cells of Ornithogalum
and in the pith cells of Tazodium, that the pit membranes are demonstrably porous,
and that a striation can be observed crossing the membrane upon action with iodine
and Chlor. Zine Tod. He also represents this striation in figs. 17, 18, 19, and 28,
Tafel I. ; and again in fig. 23, Tafel IT., he shows that a similar striation may be 8een
in the closing membrane of the pits in the thickened cells of the seed-coat of Viseum.

As far as regards Ornithogalum I can fully confirm his results, and the fact of the
existence of a similar structure in Tazodium and Viseum is one of great value.

Staining with picric-HorManx's-blue, snbsequent to the action of iodine and
Chlor. Zine Tod., will demonstrate in the case of Ornithogalum that the pit membrane
is distinetly blue, while the rest of the cell-wall is practically colourless, and will also
bring out more clearly the striation of the pit membrane, due to the presence of
threads. This, however, is by no means a favourable case. Y

Sections of the endosperm cells of Bomarea oligantha, after swelling and staining,
gave me good results, Tf examined in a somewhat cursory manner it is ab once observed
that the pit membrane is well coloured and distinetly delineated from the res of the
cell-wall (Plate 70, fig. 27). In ome instances it can be observed that instead of
