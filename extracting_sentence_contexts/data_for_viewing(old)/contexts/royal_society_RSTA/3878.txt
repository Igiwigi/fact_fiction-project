Figure 3. (a) Second order KAM of an EBSD map showing mosaic sub-structure (20 jzm step size). The profile shows the
cumulative misorientation along the dashed line relative to labelled point 0. The grain boundaries are plotted in black
(misorientation angle higher than 7Â°). (6) Pole figures for each SGB. The total misorientation accommodated by the SGB is
indicated at the bottom right of the pole figure. On the SGB P8-S3 pole figure, the misorientation axis resulting from the
combination of the misorientations of SGBs P8-S1 and P8-S2 is plotted as a grey square. (Online version in colour.)

within the parent grain P12 which results in a high GOS for this grain. On the contrary, the GOS
of the small grains n1 and n2 is low and very low mis2mean values are measured in these grains.
Based on the smooth shape of grain boundaries between grain n1 and grain P12, and between
grain n2 and grain P12, we assume the two small grains to have grown at the expense of grain P12.
This interpretation is substantiated by the fact that the mis2mean map shows more sub-structures
in the vicinity of the small grains within grain P12 than within grain P11.

The pole figure shown in figure 5 represents the orientation of each grain of the figure, with
symbols proportional to the grain size. The orientations of the small grains n1 and n2 are close to
the orientation of grain P11, while the orientation of the small grain r1 is close to grain P12. Grain
r1 is also characterized by a high GOS value and has a relatively serrated grain boundary. Based
on these observations, we hypothesize that nl and n2 are new grains formed by bulging of the
grain boundary between P11 and growing at the expense of P12, while grain r1 could well be a
