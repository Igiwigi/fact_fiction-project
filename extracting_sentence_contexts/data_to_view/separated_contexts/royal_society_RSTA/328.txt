'= KA(az) /4g = Ke (az,/N)4/2g. For a typical acceleration recorder record, N = 360, k = 9:81, (a2,)* = 0-4 and Â¢ may be taken
as --0.1 cm., to allow not only for errors in measuring the amplitude but also for the fact
that individual peaks are neither truly sinusoidal in form nor of equal duration. This gives
6g=7-8 mgals and A(dg) =0-146 mgal.
