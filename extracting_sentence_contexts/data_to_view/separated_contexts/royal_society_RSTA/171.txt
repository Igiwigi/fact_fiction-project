(corresponding to the number of pixels in each image), but in fact potentially
described by the variation of a much smaller number of parameters. Some
influential approaches to this problem include ISOMAP (Tenenbaum et al. 2000),
local linear embedding (Roweis & Saul 2000), Laplacian eigenmaps (Belkin &
Niyogi 2003) and Hessian eigenmaps (Donoho & Grimes 2003). These nonlinear representations can also be described as spectral methods for
dimension reduction, because each involves finding a small number of extreme
eigenvalue/vector pairs for a suitable matrix derived from the local characteristics
of the data (a;).
