of 28 1bs. in its sustaining-power.

32. But the most extraordinary fact brought out in connexion with the latter series of
experiments, is the development of a much greater amount of magnetism in the electro-
magnet than that which existed in the permanent magnets employed in exciting it ; for
while the four permanent magnets on the cylinder were only capable, collectively, of
sustaining a weight of about 40 1bs., the electro-magnet, as will be seen from the Table,
would sustain a weight of 178:5 lbs. 33. In order that this remarkable property might be exhibited in a more striking
manner, a large electro-magnet was constructed by screwing into a heayy iron block, 6
inches in thickness, two cylinders of wrought iron 24 inches in length and 3+ inches in
diameter.
