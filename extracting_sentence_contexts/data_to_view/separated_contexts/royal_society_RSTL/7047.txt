Supposing
that the velocity of the vessel be now diminished, the liquid will be observed to sink,
but will rise again immediately to its former position*when the rotation returns to its
previous limit of angular velocity. This velocity is the result of the balance of two
forces acting on the liquid particles, namely, gravity and centrifugal force. It is a well-known fact that the curvilinear 8urface produced by a liquid in rotation is

that of a paraboloid, the parameter of which is expressed by ED and the curve itself
therefore by the formula

z signifying vertical distance from the apex,

w the angular velocity of rotation, and

g acceleration by gravity in one second. In this formula there is no factor denoting the density of the liquid, which proves
that the point to which the liquid is raised by a given angular velocity is independent of
the specific gravity of the liquid employed. By substituting for y the radius 7 of the rotating cup at the brim, and for z the height
