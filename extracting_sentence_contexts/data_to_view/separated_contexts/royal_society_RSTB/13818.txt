However, this metric has provided a foundation for much
of what we know about diving physiology and oxygen manage-
ment (see [65]). Finally, the recording of brain activity has
revealed astonishing insights into cognition, navigation and
sleep in both wild and captive animals [22,23,39], with
advanced loggers currently as small as 1.92 g commercially
available at the time of writing (see https: //www.vyssotski.
ch). Currently, there is comparatively little work in animal
physiologging on circulating compounds in the blood, despite
the fact that an automated blood sampling device was first envi-
saged and built in 1986 [66]. This device was further refined
recently and a current version measures 18 x 8.6 cm, weighs

160 g in water and is capable of drawing two blood samples
during deployment [67]. Furthermore, a technology from the
biomedical field has been adapted to provide continuous,
non-invasive measurements of blood flow and tissue oxygen-
ation through Near Infrared Spectroscopy technology [34,35],
and the future adaptation of medical technology will permit
measurements of circulating chemicals in an animal’s tissues.
