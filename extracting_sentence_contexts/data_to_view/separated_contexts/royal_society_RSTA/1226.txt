Initially, we discuss the origins of electron beam sensitivity of materials and ways to mitigate
these effects. Electron beam-induced damage has been investigated intermittently over the years
including key studies in [3-7]. In fact electron irradiation has even been used as a surrogate for
fast neutron damage in the study of materials for application in nuclear fission and fusion (early
work is summarized in [8] and more recent works in [9-11]). The electron dose experienced by a sample is the energy absorbed by the specimen during
electron irradiation and is a function of both the incident energy of the accelerated electrons,
electron fluence (the number of electrons per unit area) and fluence rate or flux (the number
of electrons per unit area per second) in the TEM, as well as parameters associated with the
specimen itself such as the thickness and chemical composition. The absorbed dose is strictly
measured in Grays (note a Gray (Gy) is 1 Joule of energy deposited per kg of matter), and


for 100 keV electrons exposed to a typical organic material an electron fluence of 1 electron/A*
or ca 1.6x10-3Ccem~ is then equivalent to a total absorbed dose of a few MGy [12].
