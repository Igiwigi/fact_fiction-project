which CuO is chemically and structurally related. An experiment performed at the ESRF and at
the Swiss Light Source by Scagnoli et al. [41], but with a crucial theory contribution from Diamond
scientists, seems to show evidence of such a link. Scagnoli et al. used resonant X-ray diffraction
to observe the so-called orbital currents in a copper-oxygen plaquette, the basic building block of
cuprate superconductors.

Many other type II multiferroics have complex rotating magnetic structures but do not fall
neatly in the category of cycloidal magnets. Cu3Nb2Og, which was studied by Johnson et al.
[42] on the Materials and Magnetism beamline (116), provides just such an example. Below 24 K,
Cu3Nb2QOg spins order with helicoidal magnetic structure of the most general kind. Johnson et al.
demonstrated that the direction of polarization in Cu3Nb2QOg is inconsistent with the cycloidal
mechanism and proposed a new ‘ferroaxial’ mechanism that couples with the chiral component
of the magnetic structure. It is noteworthy that Cu? ions in this compound have $ = } The fact
that such detailed information could be extracted in a system with such low spin using non-
resonant scattering is a remarkable testimony to the quality of the data produced by the Materials
and Magnetism beamline (116).

Resonant soft X-ray diffraction (RSXD) is another powerful tool to study multiferroics,
although, in the case of transition metal oxides, its applicability is limited to materials where
magnetic Bragg peaks are present in the Ewald sphere accessible at the L723, M45 or O K-edge
resonances [43]. Nevertheless, significant insights have been obtained using RSXD [4446], and



RSXD is also an area of active interest for Diamond theorists [47-50]. A good example is provided 8 |
