dependence of conductivity on temperature. This provides the means for discriminating
between the single lattice model and any barrier model. Writing the conductivity

there is no reason to suppose that either the quantum yield or the recombination coeflicient
is strongly temperature-dependent. In the extreme case of the resistance depending only
on potential barriers (n, slowly varying with temperature), the coefficient of v( 7’) would
be constant for a given illumination. This requires 7,/7,, to be constant, and therefore ¢;
and o,, to increase equally rapidly with 7. The curves in figures 15 and 17 show that this
is not the case, in fact, not only are the plots of log 7, and log 7; quite dissimilar, but ¢;
actually decreases with increasing temperature, so long as ¢;>¢,. On the other hand, the
assumption that v(7') is constant would require ¢; a constant for 7,>0,, and this is very
much closer to the experimental results. The relatively slow decrease in 0; with increasing
temperature may, perhaps, be due to a slow decrease in mobility arising from increased
scattering by lattice vibrations. Frohlich & Mott (1939) have shown that on this account
the mobility of electrons in an ionic crystal takes the form

quency by @=hv/k. The experimental slopes dlog ¢;/d(1/k7’) in table 4 show that if this
is the correct interpretation of the variation of 7;, the characteristic temperature must be
