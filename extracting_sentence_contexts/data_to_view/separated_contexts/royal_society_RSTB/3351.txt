J. Berry, in discussing a paper on “ Endemic
Cretinism in the Chitral and Gilgit Valleys,” read by Captain R. McCarrison, I.M.S., “deplored the fact
that for the last few years an immense amount of teaching had been spread abroad alleging that the
parathyroids were special glands with a special function distinct from the thyroid.”

Although many English pathologists accept the view put forward by Vincent and Jotty, and
supported, with some modifications, by Forsyrx, yet others, notably EpMunps (‘ Lancet,’ November 14,
1908), hold firmly to the theory that the parathyroids have a function distinct from that of the thyroid. In a publication of an earlier date (‘Erasmus Wilson Lectures,’ Edinburgh and London, 1901)
EpmuNps says: “It is not easy to identify the parathyroid glands in the human subject, because some
of the minute outlying nodules are found to consist of ordinary thyroid tissue, and to be, therefore,
accessory thyroid glands: only those that consist mainly or exclusively of cells are to be regarded as
parathyroid glands.” I presume that Dr. EpMunps would insist that the structure drawn in Plate 12,
fig. 14, is a thyroid, and that all the instances of intermediate structures in the body of this paper are
thyroid also, because they do not consist exclusively of cells.
