# PALCcoﬀER, in his notes on. Colossochelys atlas (Palzontolog. Mem. vol. i. p. 378), states that © tho thiekness
of hone in the convexity is almost in an inverse ratio to the 8ize. The physiological reason of this is, that the
smaller the animal, the more liable it is to injury, and it requires a greater arch to sustain it,” This view is
not confirmed by an examination of the living Tortoises ; the Aldabra epecies is as large as those from the
Galapagos, and eyen larger than one of those latter, yet it has a much thicker shell. Wo, hall seo that the
extinct Mascarene species agree with the Galapagos Tortoises in this respect. Perhaps the cause of this is to
be ought in the 8mall quantity of earthy matter contained in the food on which thoso animals chiefly subsist,
viz. succulent cacti. A living Galapagos Tortoise in my possession prefers, at present, the petals of a Westeria
to every other plant. Of cours, by the thinness of the hell its weight is much reduced, and these Tortoises
aro therefore able to walk faster and to carry the shell higher above the ground than the othor species of this
genus. The thinness of the shell and the slender os8cous framework of the limbs are, in fact, characters cnxrolatel
to each other. + Withont epidermoid scutes.

Osteology.—In the preceding remarks, as well as in the following notes on the osteo-
logical characters of the yarious species, it is not my intention to give such a complete
description as would include every detail common to all the species of Testudo ; but I
shall limit myself to those points only by which the various species of gigantic Tortoises
differ from one another in a marked manner.
