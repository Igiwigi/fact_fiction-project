Ann.,’ 1895) ; his result is that K, or what comes to the.same under these conditions,
K—1,is an additive physical constant, whereas the formula of CLausins and Lorentz makes (K—1)/(K +2)
additive. The determinations made by St.sersvetn for mixtures of benzol and phenylethylacetate give
results for the Loren1z constant which aro always in excess of the theoretical value, by amounts ranging

up to 8 per cent. ; the discrepancies for his own constant K—1 are rather smaller, and are in both direc-

of radiation across a medium permeated by molecules, each consisting of a system of
electrons in steady orbital motion, and each capable of free oscillations about the
steady state of motion with definite free periods analogous to those of the planetary
inequalities of the Solar System; and its analysis will in fact resemble Lapnacr’s
general investigation of the latter problem. If 6), 4,... represent small deviations
