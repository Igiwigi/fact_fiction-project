If, in addition, P lies upon the line .*,.%7,, then 7, = 0, so that P lies also upon the curve
w(1) = 0, the aggregate of points for which p, = 0; and P coincides with the Ball point 2,
having four consecutive positions in line. The Ball point arises then as the second intersection
of the line .o,.°7, with the inflexion circle; or as the foot of the perpendicular from .e/, upon

If, as a special case, the Ball point has five consecutive positions in line, some limitation
upon the position of the fourth cardinal point .9/, is implied; for then, from the preceding

* The points /, and ./, have also been obtained (Léauté) as the limiting position of the acceleration
centre, and of the first hypercentre, as the relative angular acceleration of the two planes tends to zero;
and, in fact, the remaining points .o/ . can be derived in like fashion. And dually also the points .o/;

But these points, and their duals, are intrinsically properties of the ‘generalized path’ of a relative to p, and
not of any particular motion in this path, And, in any ¢
by this property.

ase, their role is more fundamental than is indicated
