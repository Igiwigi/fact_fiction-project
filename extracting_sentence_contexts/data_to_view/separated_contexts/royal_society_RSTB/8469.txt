Additionally, conserved motifs allow easy alignment of even distantly related
proteins, demonstrating, for example, the common ancestry of retroviruses and
the many RT-containing elements found among various kingdoms of life [10]. Jamie E. Henzy Early RT-based analyses revealed the surprising fact that proviruses representing

more harbour recognizable features of extant retroviruses, despite their notori-
ously high substitution rate [11-13]. While this situation leads evolutionists to
ponder the ‘molecular clock’ conundrum [14], the fidelity of features over deep
evolutionary time also gives us a set of data that can be analysed using phylogen-
etic methods, revealing evolutionary dynamics of retrovirus—host interactions. Phylogenetic analysis of ERV RT sequences also reveals that ERVs cluster
closely with genera of extant retroviruses.
