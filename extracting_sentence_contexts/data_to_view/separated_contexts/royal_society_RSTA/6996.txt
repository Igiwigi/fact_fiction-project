These growth increments now
diffuse along the step, but at the same time the spiral continues to rotate, so that while the
increment spreads, its centre recedes from the dislocation, the arc distance being expressible

approximately as 5 = p,(l/4p,+t)?. Near the centre of the spiral the concept of an area diffusing along a line fails; the growth
increment which diffuses into the centre is used up in extending the step line faster than would
occur spontaneously. Supposing the diffusion law continued to hold as far as the centre of the spiral and on
some fictitious line beyond it, the value of f at this point resulting from one meeting of the
growth fronts at a time ¢ = 0 would be approximately

Sa = (4-1) P/16 (mp, 0. t)} exp [—p_(l/ 4p, +ut)*/40. 1]. THE GROWTH OF CRYSTALS 349

This is zero for small or large ¢, and has a maximum very nearly at the maximum of the
exponential factor which occurs at ¢ = //12up,. Inserting this value of ¢, and at the same time
writing @ = ev,,/2p,, where ¢ is a factor representing the increase of rate of rotation over that
of an unperturbed single spiral, we have

Sa, max. = [(4—m)/16] (Gel /np,)' exp [ — (4e) (/3p,)5].
