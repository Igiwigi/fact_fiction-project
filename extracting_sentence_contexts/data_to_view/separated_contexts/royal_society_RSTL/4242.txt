I myself have never observed any action beyond the extrusion of the penis, but
my friend Mr. BriG6nTweELL has observed in seven different instances the direct copula-
tion of the*two sexes. The following quotation from his notice of the fact in the
Annals of Natural History for September 1848, clearly demonstrates this important
circumstance.

* Observations as to the Union between the Sexes.

* June 15th.—Placed a male and six females in a small glass trough by themselves,
and two males and about thirty females in a large trough.

* June 16th, between 7 and 8 a.M.—On examining the small trough observed that
the male on approaching one of the females attached himself* to its side by the sper-
matozoid projection, and remained $0 attached from twenty to thirty seconds. The
same male acted precisely in the same manner with four other females. These five
connexions took place in about fifteen minutes.

*At 5 p.M.—Saw one of the males in the larger trough attach himself to a young
one of the other sex for about twenty seconds, and afterwards to a full-grown female
for a somewhat longer time.
