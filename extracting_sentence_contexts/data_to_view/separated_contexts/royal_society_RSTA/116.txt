This body corresponds to F(x,, x2) = max (—%, x», x, x»/k). INEQUALITIES WITH AN INFINITY OF SOLUTIONS 315

We now use the fact that K has automorphisms which transform any point other than O
into points arbitrarily far from O. Let Q be a particular automorphism of K such that the
point QP, is outside H. Then, provided 7; is sufficiently large, the lattice QA” has a point
QP outside H, and also, by the hypothesis of the induction, has at least 2k+-1 points in H.
But now the lattice A® has at least 2k+-1 points in the bounded body Q-'H, and has two
additional points +P) in K, If r; is sufficiently large, K°? contains Q-'H, and so A’?
has at least 2k +3 points in K*, contrary to supposition.
