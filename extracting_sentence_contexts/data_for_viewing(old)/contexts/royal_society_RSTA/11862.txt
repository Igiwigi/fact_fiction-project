to Mr. Coox, who made the instrument in the Laboratory workshop. Most of the
work in connection with mounting the moving parts and in installing the instrument
was done by Mr. BREARLEY.

A great, if not the chief, difficulty, in attempting to form a theory of electro-
chemistry lies in the uncertainty surrounding the data. The memorable researches of
Koutrauscu on the conductivity of water, as well as those of Drxon on the effect of a
small impurity on the mode of combination of gases, together with the quite allied
and equally peculiarly large variations produced in thermoelectric power and contact
force phenomena by minute differences of chemical composition, have had a most de-
structive effect on the theories of twenty years ago. It is not too much to say that
the electrical action of most bodies in a pure state is entirely unknown at present,
although the fact of the continuity of the electrical properties of certain substances—
e.g. mercury, gold, and copper—as they are more and more purified, raises a hope
that the properties of substances as at present investigated may only differ quantita-
tively from their properties when pure ; but whether this be so or not can only be
decided by experiment. The question as to the effect of purification is one which
must be discussed in each separate case, and probably over and over again, for the
word “ pure” has no significance except with respect to a definite state of the art of
chemistry. It is to be noted that the final stayes in a process of purification must
always depend more or less upon hypothesis—for a point is soon reached where the
impurities become too small in amount to be amenable to ordinary chemical examina-
tion. Theoretically this can be got over by operating on large quantities of substances,
but in practice such is not found to be the case, for the greater the bulk of substance
to be prepared, the more time is required for its preparation* and the greater is the
