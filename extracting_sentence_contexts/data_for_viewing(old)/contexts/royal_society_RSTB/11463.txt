1. Introduction

Abstract words allow us to convey important human ideas like scientific
(e.g. theory, calculus) and social (e.g. justice) concepts, and extend our capacity

fact that abstract words make up the majority of our lexicon [1], empirical studies
of word meaning have historically focused on studying concrete words (e.g. truck;
[2-4]). There are intuitive differences between concrete and abstract words: our
understanding of truck unfolds against the physical reality in which we operate.
We can perceive concrete referents through various senses and we can physically
interact with them. Their physical existence and our typical perceptual and motor
experiences with them provide stable scaffolding. Indeed, there is mounting
evidence for the involvement of sensorimotor systems in the processing of con-
crete words (e.g. [5,6]), and many theories of conceptual representation assume
a tight coupling between sensorimotor and conceptual systems (e.g. [7]; for a
review see [8]). It is much harder to make the case that processing of abstract
words such as truth is aided by these systems. In fact, abstract words are most
commonly characterized in the literature by the absence of physical or spatial
