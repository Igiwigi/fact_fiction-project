found to persist even when children are provided with
causal information that should make such simulations
easier to generate [29]. Moreover, children come to affirm
the possibility of unusual events if provided with information
about other similar unusual events [28].

Together with the current work, such findings suggest
that preschoolers’ conservative assessments of what is poss-
ible may not reflect failures to simulate or envision remote
possibilities. Instead, their conservativism may result because
they are anchored by their knowledge of the present and

familiar, and because they are limited in using their factual
knowledge to infer how things might otherwise be.
