DR. DAVY'S ACCOUNT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD. 293

me, that a very slight compressing force is sufficient to confine the air in the blood,
or rather, I should say, prevent its snbstance assuming the elastic state ; and further,
the probability, that the quantity of air s0 condensed is small.

I have stated that in the majority of instances the indications of the disengagement
of air from blood in vacuo have been manifest. Exceptions, however, have occurred,
and those clear and decisive; inducing me to believe that the quantity of air con-
densed in the blood is variable; that there are times when it is in excess, and times
when in deficiency, and when totally wanting, connected with regularly changing
states of the functional system. I hope on another occasion to be able to recur to
this part of the subject, on which at present I have collected but a few facts. I may
add, that such facts tend in part to reconcile some of the discrepancies referred to in
the beginning of this section.

V. Of the air or gases contained in the blood capable of being extricated by the air-
pump.

As already mentioned, M. Macnvus has $tated that these gases are carbonic acid,
oxygen and azote in notable quantities. Taking the mean of ten of his experiments
on the blood of the Horse and Calf (five on arterial and five on yenous), the total
quantity of the mixed gases he obtained was, in the instance of arterial blood, 10-4 per
cent. per volume, and in that of venous 7'6 per cent. ; the former consisting of about
