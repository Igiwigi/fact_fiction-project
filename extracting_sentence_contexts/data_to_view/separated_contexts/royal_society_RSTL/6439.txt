"A On the average of this period the weight on the Sunday was 1 1b. 12 oz. greater than
© on the Saturday. S There was considerable variation in the progression. from day to day in the different
5 weeks; but there was much uniformity in the general fact of a decrease in weight towards
8 the end of the week, and the increase at the beginning of the week was witlout excep-
tion. During the firs: week I made considerable physical exertion daily, but in the
others the amount varied; and the average weight of the body increased weekly, as
follows: 8 1bs. 4 oz., 9 lbs. 3+ oz., and 10 1bs. 5 oz. + 15 stones. The difference in the
average weights on the two' firs} and the two Jast days of the week was 1 1b. 54 oz. in
favour of the former; but that in the extremes of single observations was 2 Ibs. 34 02.
