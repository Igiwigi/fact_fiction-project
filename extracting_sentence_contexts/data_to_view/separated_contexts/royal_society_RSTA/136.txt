5 In the case of a crystal which is of the correct order of thickness in relation to the wave-
length employed, and which is sufficiently mosaic to give good secondary extinction but

_ little primary extinction, planes will be reflecting throughout the whole thickness of the

crystal. One might expect, therefore, that although the absorption lines will be relatively
narrow if the disorientation of individual crystallites is small, yet the reflexion lines should
be broad (figure 4). In fact, the reflexion lines are usually little, if at all, broader than the’
absorption lines (plate 17, figure 22c). Rays reflected from planes nearto the source, if they
do not emerge at once from that side of the crystal, are lost by multiple reflexion and absorp-
tion. Only the rays reflected from planes in regions near to the surface (S’ and 8” in figure 5)
