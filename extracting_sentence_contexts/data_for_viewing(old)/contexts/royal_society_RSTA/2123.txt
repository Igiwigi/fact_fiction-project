N=e%; (4.2)

most of these are expected to be in a range of masses (M,M — AM) with AM ~ 1/R. The state of
the environment is described by we. Moreover, by Postulate III, Correspondence, this state should
have a good approximate description by a state of LOFT.

Postulate I, Quantum Mechanics, implies, in particular, that evolution of states (4.1) is unitary.
Its infinitesimal generator takes the form

H=Hpn + Heny + Hr, (4.3)

where Hyp, and Heny act on the BH and environment subsystems, respectively, and H] acts on both,
and can transfer information between them. In fact, LQFT evolution, on a time slicing, can be put
in this form [34]. However, LQFT evolution will not be unitary once the shrinkage of the BH is
taken into account, as we have argued above. In LOFT, H only increases entanglement between
BH and the environment, either by creating Hawking pairs or by transferring entanglement from
the environment to the BH, resulting in the unacceptable situation described in §2. So, in order to
obey Postulate I, equation (4.3) must have another term that transfers entanglement from the BH
to the environment: BH quantum states must be able to influence their surroundings. Moreover,


the LOFT version of Hph is not expected to give the correct dynamics, although we will be largely
agnostic about its exact form. Finally, in LQFT, the state on a slice in principle allows a description
of a much larger number of BH states than given by (4.2); in assuming that the states are described
as in (4.1) and (4.2), we are also assuming an important structural departure from the LQFT
