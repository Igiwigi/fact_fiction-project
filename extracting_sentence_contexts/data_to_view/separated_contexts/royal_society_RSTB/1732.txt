It is with the Sphenophyllez that the points of agreement are most numerous. They were briefly enumerated in the preliminary paper,t but it is necessary to
recapitulate them somewhat more fully :—

1, The arrangement of the appendages in superposed verticils is a striking point
of resemblance to Sphenophyllum, in which genus the fact of superposition is well
established for the vegetative region, and indeed appears to be necessarily correlated
with the anatomical structure.t Whether the superposition extended to the bracts
of the strobilus in Sphenophyllum is somewhat doubtful. Counr Sorms-LauBacu
finds that this was the case in his Bowmanites Rémeri, and thinks it may also have
been so in the other fructifications of the family.§ The fact that the number of
members in a whorl is a multiple of three (12 in the cone, diminishing to 9 in the
peduncle) also recalls Sphenophyllum, though in Cheirestrobus these numbers do not
bear the same relation to the anatomical structure as in that genus.

2. The palmatifid segmentation of the foliar appendages is a point in common with
many species of Sphenophyllum, where every degree of such segmentation is found
in many species, ¢.g., S. tenerrimum, S. cuneifolium.

3. The sub-division of the sporophyll into inferior and superior lobes, which are
respectively sterile and fertile.
