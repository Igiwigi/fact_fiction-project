About 150 feet of mucronata chalk is
exposed here. The occurrence of Metopaster twmidus, the characteristic mucronata
member of the Parkinsoni series in these beds, shows the wide range of that form. Except in the first appearance of M. tumidus and the fact that Crateraster
quinqueloba and Metopaster uncatus begin to become rare, there is little to mark
this fauna as distinct from that of quadratus beds. The 275 feet of chalk accessible in the Isle of Wight at Alum Bay shows
a more extensive diversity of the fauna. The members of the Crateraster
quinqueloba series, after a period of regression which bid fair to cause their extinction
(pp. 121-122), assume a further period of predominance and show renewed elaboration.
