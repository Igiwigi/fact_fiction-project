This correspondence between the symbolic and tensorial expression of a concomitant
becomes apparent in the general case if both methods are used simultaneously, the tensors
being factorized symbolically as products of tensors of rank unity.

The symbolic method is justified by the far-reaching results that can be obtained by its
use, but the artifice of representing the general cubic by one which is an exact cube involves
an apparent deviation from fact which is distasteful to some people. I believe that it has not

previously been recognized that this objection can very easily be overcome, and the symbolic

method placed on a sound logical basis as follows (see also Turnbull 1928; Grace & Young
1903, pp. 865-366

Although every binary cubic is not an exact cube, it is expressible as a sum of cubes. â€˜The

number of cubes which must appear in the sum is irrelevant. The cubic can thus be expressed
