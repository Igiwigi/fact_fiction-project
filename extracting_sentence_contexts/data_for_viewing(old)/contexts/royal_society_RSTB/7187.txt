Cc. W. WARDLAW ON THE SHOOT APEX OF DRYOPTERIS 447

of an actively growing apical meristem, in a position determined by a system of stresses
(Wardlaw 19484,c), and presumably in a certain physiological condition, grow out and
give rise to a lateral member. For the reasons given above, this member develops with
the symmetry and shape which we recognize in leaves. As leaf primordia, with their
enlarging bases, develop in sequence, the lower region of the apical meristem becomes
largely transformed during growth into epidermis and cortical parenchyma. But in certain
positions, which can best be specified as interfoliar, small areas of the superficial meriste-
matic cells persist in an unaltered state. These persistent areas gradually move away from
the apex during growth and are recognized farther down the shoot as detached meristems
or bud rudiments. They show little tendency to grow; in fact, they are in an inhibited
condition and remain so until the apical cell of the shoot is destroyed or becomes quiescent
when they give rise to lateral buds.

In the present view, lateral organs are an expression of the growth of the shoot apex;
they are not specifically predetermined either by the hereditary constitution of the plant—
although the potentiality for their development must be there—or by the pre-existence in
the race of organs of different fundamental categories. The category to which a lateral
organ belongs, be it leaf, bud, or scale, depends on the position at the apex in which it is
formed; and it is to the mechanics of growth in the plastic distal region of the shoot that
we must look for explanations of the characteristic symmetry, form and structure of the leaf
primordium as compared with the corresponding features of a bud primordium. In this
analysis the conclusions regarding the nature of the leaf are in some respects similar to
