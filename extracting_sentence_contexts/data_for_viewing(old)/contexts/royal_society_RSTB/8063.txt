of characters; while in the surface-living senonensis this pressure would have been much
reduced, so that the whole complex of characters would be more ‘old fashioned’ in the
latter forms than in the contemporaneous coranguinum. As has already been suggested above
(§ IIIc), a tall conical shape was advantageous to an echinoid living on the bottom of the
Chalk Sea, a more flattened shape was more advantageous to a burrowing form. This
would explain the differences in inherent shape between the two species in relative height
of the test. No explanation can be offered of the differences between the two in the breadth
and thickness of the test, or in the ambulacra.

Except the area of the sub-anal fasciole, all the characters in the two species overlap
in their ranges of variation. This is explained by assuming that they, like some recent
echinoids, interbred to some extent in nature. Certain of the evolutionary implications
of this fact will be discussed below.

Isomicraster was established by Lambert in 1901 as a subgenus of Muicraster. In this
description he did not nominate a subgenotype. In 1928 Lambert & Thiéry again define
Isomicraster as a subgenus of Micraster giving M. (Lsomicraster) stollyei as the subgenotype.
The custom has arisen of referring to members of the subgenus Jsomicraster as though the
latter were the generic name. ‘This custom has nothing whatever to commend it: it simply
obscures the close relationship of these forms to the other members of the genus Micraster.
M. (Isomicraster) senonensis itself was first described by Lambert in 1895 as M. senonensis. In 1901
he placed this species in his subgenus /somicraster, the members of which were characterized
by having the sub-anal fasciole absent or vestigial. M. (J.) senonensis is clearly so closely
related to forms of the main M. cortestudinarium—M. coranguinum phylum, that it is
undesirable to place it in a separate subgenus from them. It is much better to refer to it
