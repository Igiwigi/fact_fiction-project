The term in the brackets contains the angular variation of M’, and this factor is plotted

as a function of wave normal direction # in figure 15. It can be seen that over a wide range
of 0 the variations of numerator and denominator more or less compensate one another,

and that in fact their ratio is within 8°, of unity for values of 7 up to 70

This result, that the group-ray refractive index is practically independent of wave normal

direction, is important and simplifies some of the later arguments.
