But if, on the contrary, it should be found upon re-
peated trials, that the equilibrium 'was restored when the
greater light had arrived at a distance sbort of 202 inches, I
might thence conclude, that such effect might safely be attri-
buted to the imperfect transparency of the air : for notwith-
standing that the light of the smaller lamp would of course be
diminished as well as that of the greater, yet as there is every
reason to suppose that the diminution, whatever it may be,
must ever be proportional to. the distance through which the
light passes in the medium, as the augmentation of the dis-
tance through which the light of the smaller lamp passes is no
more than 20 inches, while that of the greater is made to pass
through an additional distance, amounting to more than 100
inches, it is evident that the diminution of the light of the
greater lamp, arising from the imperfect transparency of the
medium, must be greater than the diminution of the light of
the less lamp, arising from the same cause ; and, consequently,

the experiment, were they in reality considerable. The following table will shew the results of the experiments
which were made with a view to determine that fact,
