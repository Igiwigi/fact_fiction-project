It may seem a small thing in itself to follow out the evolutionary history, so to
speak, in the columella in Madreporaria. And to bring together evidence of its having
taken origin as a modification in one ease of tabule, in another of a principal septum,

main septum” in species of Hnallohelia, Turbinaria, Madre-

in another of a meshwork of septal ends and basal structures. In all cases we read
a lesson with which zoologists have already made us familiar in many other chapters
of animal life, viz., the economy practised in the workshop of evolution, how old struc-
tures become adapted to perform new functions. Where no adaptation takes place
the tendency is for these old structures to retrograde or vanish. The fertility of
resource in the adaptation is shown by the fact that both radial and basal structures
could be transformed into a central columella. The new requirement on the part of
the coral polyp was apparently always one and the same, and it was attained by the
simple means of a central support in the visceral chamber. Before we consider what
the new requirement was, it is important to note that the different skeletal modi-
fications to produce a columella must have been in every case associated with a
change of shape in the skeletal support of the polyp’s visceral chamber. The latter,
from being flat, or saucer shaped, assumed cup-like proportions, but was fitted over a
ceutral stalk, leaving thus a deepened circular trench in the middle of the chamber,
