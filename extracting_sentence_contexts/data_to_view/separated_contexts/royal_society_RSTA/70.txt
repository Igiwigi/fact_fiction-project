Theorem 4.2 (Nash equilibria in mixed strategies converge to Cournot-Nash equilibria). If
assumption (4.1) holds for w(t) = Kt, then the conclusions of theorem 4.1 applies to the extension in mixed
strategies with the extended cost

NG, 0-) = es IN Gi,x,-i)m(dx) @ a; (dx). This theorem is a direct consequence of the fact that for uniformly Lipschitz J, the extension
in mixed strategies still satisfies (4.1). Lemma 4.3. Under the assumptions of theorem 4.2, the extended cost J satisfies
