engineering firms, other academics and researchers. In the Cork workshop, we explicitly asked
the stakeholders to engage with the challenges of translating data/risk assessment into local
action. This was supplemented by individual interviews with national and local stakeholders. See
appendix A for a full list of organizations represented in our stakeholder engagement throughout
the ARC research project.

(b) The Cork city case study

Cork is Ireland's second largest city, with a population of 125000. Located in the southwest of the
country, Cork city is highly vulnerable to flooding, largely as a result of its geography. The city is
located at the mouth of the River Lee, which flows west to east through the city, dividing in two
to the west of the city centre, merging again to the east of the city as it flows out to sea. Much
of the city centre is low-lying and exposed to both fluvial and tidal flooding events. In fact, the
Irish (Gaelic) name for Cork is Corcaigh, meaning bog or marsh. Early maps of the city from the
sixteenth century show large parts of what is now the city centre marked as ‘Marsh’ or ‘Marshes’
(figure 3).

Cork has experienced frequent flooding throughout its history; some 292 floods were reported
over the period 1841-1988 [64]. In more recent times, floods causing damage to property in the city
occurred in 1996, 2000, 2009 and 2014 [65]. The floods of 2009, in particular, were one of the most
severe ever to hit the city [66,67]. Insurance claims for this one event are estimated at €244 m2
While the 2009 event was a result of fluvial flooding on the River Lee, Cork is also exposed to sea-
level rise and the city already suffers regular tidal flooding. Recent scientific estimates suggest that
global mean sea level could rise by over 2m by 2100 (e.g. [68,69]). For a given amount of global
mean sea-level rise, the local (or relative) rise experienced will vary considerably in different parts
