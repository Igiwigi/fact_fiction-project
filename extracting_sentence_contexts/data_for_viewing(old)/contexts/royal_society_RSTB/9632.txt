sage that once a cellular lineage had acquired DNA (with all
the competitive advantages that DNA provides, including

high genome stability and the possibility to have large
genome sizes), it did not outcompete all the other, less fit,
RNA genome-based lineages. For those genomic and ecologi-
cal reasons, the hypothesis of three independent DNA
acquisitions by the ancestors of the three life domains from
viral donors is completely unrealistic.

The same type of criticisms can be addressed to the prop-
ositions of a viral origin of the eukaryotic nucleus, which are
based on the fact that some large DNA viruses and the nucleus
share similarities such as linear chromosomes, mRNA capping
and the separation of transcription from translation [35,36].
However, those viruses do not encode the components that
build the nuclear membranes or any other nuclear feature.
Viruses endowed with a lipid envelope acquire it from the
membrane host during viral release [49]. The superficial overall
resemblances between the macromolecular complexes formed
within the infected cells during the replication of the viruses,
known as ‘viral factories’ [50], and bona fide eukaryotic
nuclei do not reflect actual homology. This is a similar case
to that of the intracellular compartments found in bacte-
rial species of the PVC (Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia
