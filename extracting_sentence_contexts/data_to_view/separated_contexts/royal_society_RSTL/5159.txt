If the formulze of the two compounds be compared together,
it is evident that if both be correct, the one containing most baryta must be written
thus—C,, H,, O,,+BaO+BaO HO. In this case, however, it would be difficult to
conceive how it is possible for the second atom of baryta to escape the action of the
carbonic acid used in its preparation. It is therefore more probable that the true
formula is C,, H,, O,,+2BaO, which requires in 100 parts—

In fact the amount of carbon and hydrogen found by experiment agree better with
these numbers than with those of the other formula. These analyses lead to the conclusion, that the sugar formed by the decomposition
of rubian contains 12, not 14 atoms of carbon. Nevertheless it is doubtful whether
in these baryta compounds the sugar exists in the same state as it does when formed
by the action of acids on rubian.
