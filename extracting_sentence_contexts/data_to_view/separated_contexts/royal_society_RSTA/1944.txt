At T*/(ul?) ~ Tu) 1, as can be seen in figure 2, the tensile fragmentation rate behaves as a

lognormal, namely

where a’ is a dimensionless fitting constant, and 4) and t are fitting parameters with dimensions
of a frequency and a time, respectively. The values of these parameters reported in the caption
suggest that, while ro is of the order of the Kolmogorov time scale t,, the time t is 100 times
larger. This can be explained by the fact that Tmax(“02) ~ 7/16 and in turn, as seen in [25], typical
values of y are of the order of 0.1/t, leading to a factor of the order of 100. To summarize this section, let us stress that tensile failure is here entirely prescribed by the
(intermittent) statistics of the velocity gradients. This is a stylized feature of our approach, and
provides a simplified framework to study fragmentation.
