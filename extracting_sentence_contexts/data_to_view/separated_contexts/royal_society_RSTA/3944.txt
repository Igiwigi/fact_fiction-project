R. Soc. A Recent reanalysis revealed that the branching indicated
377: 20190220. by the computer program in this article was, in
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2019.0220 fact, triggered by a programming glitch which caused

an unintended abrupt change of Biot coefficient for
transverse water pressure on the crack. This change
suddenly increased the pressure on the solid phase
and triggered dynamic response. Such a sudden trigger
is probably unrealistic and requires correction.
