The Zoological
Society of London possessed the remaining portion of this collection ||; but the specimens
(five in number) were for some time mislaid, and were consequently not available for
the use of Messrs. STRICKLAND and MELVILLE when they published their work. In
1851 these specimens were rediscovered in the house of the Society by Mr. BarvLEvT,
and proved to be a portion of a right humerus, a right femur, a right tibia, and a right
and left tarso-metatarsal—the last two belonging to different individuals. In the
description of these bones, which Mr. BanTLEvT published s00n after**, he was induced
into several grave, though perfectly excusable, errors, and in fact only referred one of
the specimens (the right tarso-metatarsal) to the Solitaire, though there can now be no
doubt that they all belong to that species. Nor was STRICKLAND much more fortunate,
for early in the following year (1852) he also described these same specimensfF, and,
misled as his predecessor had been by the same causes (of which, however, he assigned
a different explanation), he equally imagined that he had before him the remains of
more than one species}Þ.

Besides the sizteen bones just enumerated #0 others were the property of STRICKLAND
—one, a left tarso-metatarsus, found at the same time and place as those in the Museum
at Paris; and another, a right tarso-metatarsus, 8aid to have been found in 1831 by
Colonel Dawkins, but in the same cave as the others dQ.
