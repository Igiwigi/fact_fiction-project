This genus of Ferns has been recognised as having a near relation to Dennstcedtia,
from which they differ “mainly by their extramarginal sori” ;* indeed, D, concinna
was placed in Dennstadtia by Moorr, and is described as closely resembling
Dicksonia (Dennstedtia) adiantoides in habit. In this connection D, Moorei, Hx.,
is of special interest, since it bears not only the marginal stipitate sori characteristic
of the genus, but also superficial sori. This important fact, which was noted by
Moorsg,t has been verified on herbarium specimens at Kew and at Glasgow. The sorus of D. Moorei shows sporangia of various ages intermixed and with no
definite orientation.
