When working with dilute solutions (x; 0) the activity coefficient y approaches a constant;
hence, Henry’s law for the gaseous solute in the solvent can be used to interpret the solubility of
the molecule in the mixture, as discussed elsewhere [40-44]. However, for non-dilute systems, the
solubility of the gaseous solute generally accounts for the partial pressure P(x, T) of the solute in
the gas phase above the liquid mixture, as shown in equation (3.3), where (P, T) is the fugacity
coefficient and P¥*P(T) is the equilibrium vapour pressure of the solute [45]:

®(P,T)P(x,T) =x(PY*P, T)PY*P (T)y(x,T). (3.3)

COSMO-RS theory is based upon the assumptions of an incompressible liquid and an ideal
gas phase. Therefore, equation (3.3) is only valid for systems at subcritical conditions and low
pressures. In fact, direct COSMOtherm predictions of high-pressure systems show qualitative, as
well as quantitative, deviations from the real high-pressure systems [46]. In addition, for the case
of CO2, whose critical temperature is just above ambient, the quality of the predictions is expected
to be lower, leading to consistent deviations from the real behaviour [47].

In order to overcome this limitation and achieve better predictions for high pressure systems,
combining COSMO-RS with an EoS has been suggested [40,48,49]. In particular, the integration
of COSMOtherm predictions and the SRK-EoS has proved to be a sensible methodology for
estimating the behaviour of CO2 at high pressures. In order to accomplish this, Maiti [45]
proposed to define the chemical potential of the solute molecule in its gas phase, jig(T) as
depicted in equation (3.4), where ©(P, T) is the fugacity coefficient of the gas and Po = 1 bar:

Mgas(P, T) = pig(T) + RT In(®(P, T)P/Po). (3.4)
