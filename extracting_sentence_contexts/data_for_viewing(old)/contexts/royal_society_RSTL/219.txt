phenomena take place, in a less degree. But, if the experiment
is tried with nitric acid, there is no disengagement of hydrogen
gas; and the metals effect a precipitation with much less rapi-
dity and certainty than in the former case.

It is very true, that hydrogen, in its nascent state, may have
properties with which we are yet unacquainted; and may
determine combinations, which it can in no other state produce.
But the decomposition of water, in the first instance, in order
that a new recomposition may, at that moment, be effected by
the same agents, is in itself sufficiently paradoxical.

The facts last mentioned, are s0mewhat analogous to, and
seem even confirmative. of, a theory proposed some time past
by Mrs. FuLnuame; but I shall withhold my full assent, both
to her explanation. and to any I could give, until these evident
contradictions can in some way be further elucidated.

In the analysis of every ore in which the metal is combined
with sulphur, I have found much variation in the quantity of the
latter which may be obtained, even in experiments upon the
