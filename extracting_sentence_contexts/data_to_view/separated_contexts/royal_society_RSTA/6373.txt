In order to try to unravel the mysteries of gauge symmetries, different research avenues
have been explored. Rovelli, for instance, argues that gauge symmetries are a manifestation
of the relational nature of physical observables.'* In turn, Greaves and Wallace use Galileoâ€™s
ship thought experiment [135] to argue that local symmetries can have empirical significance
or observable consequences [118] (see also [136-140]). Very briefly, the empirical significance of a
symmetry would result from the fact that a transformation acting on a subsystem of the universe
might have non-trivial observable effects associated with the relation between the subsystem
and the reference system provided by the corresponding environment.!> A different line of
argumentation clings to the fact that a symmetry transformation produces by definition states
that are, strictly speaking, indiscernible. However, this strict indiscernibility cannot be used as
an argument in favour of the thesis that gauge symmetries are mere mathematical redundancies
since the very group(oid)-theoretical structure of these indiscernibilities is an essential feature of
the corresponding theory. The epistemic fact that a given physical configuration can be described
by means of different coordinate systems is a consequence of an intrinsic geometric structure that
characterizes the theory at stake.
