Figure 3. (a) Sketch of the heel-like structure of the thread in the vicinity of the printing plate. Its shape is approximated by a
fraction of a circle with radius 1/4. (b) Kinematics of the problem describing the position of the contact point, r, and pattern, q,
forming at speed U, while being advected at speed V,. t andr’, respectively, denote the tangent to the pattern in the laboratory
frame and the tangent to the fictitious trajectory of the contact point in the frame of the nozzle. (c) The thread's curvature x is
assumed to be a function of r and @. Shown here is dependence in @ for r = Rc. (¢) Integration of the reduced model (3.5) with
Vq = 0 for (i) r(0) = 1, 6(0) = 7/2, (ii) r(0) = 0.5, H(0) = a /2 and (ili) r(0) = 1.2, 6(0) = 320 /4 displaying the stability
of the base solution (i). (e) Result of the integration of equation (3.5), where V, is a piecewise function of time as indicated in
the legend. Coils, alternated loops and meanders are recovered. (Online version in colour.)

changes depending on where the thread impinges the plate and its orientation. In the quasi-static
regime that we explore, x is a function of the two state variables of the system: (i) the distance
r separating O—the vertical projection of the nozzle on the plate—from the contact point, r; and
(ii) the direction followed by the thread as monitored by the angle ¢ between the polar direction
rand the tangent to the pattern t (figure 3b). The curvature « is a priori unknown, aside from the
reference case, Vy =0, for which « =1/R., where R, denotes the radius of coiling [10], ie. the
radius of the circular trajectory followed by the thread in figure 1b. When V, 40, « departs from
