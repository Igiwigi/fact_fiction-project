More specifically, results have been reported in
figure 9 for Re = 0.05 with respect to the non-dimensional time defined as t* = D/c, where D is the
labyrinth inlet diameter and Â¢ is the average injection velocity, as per its definition in table 4. By analysing figure 9 one can immediately notice the different behaviour of the two considered
polymers. In fact, using the same Reynolds number, some discrepancies arise when looking at
the interface silhouette. The PS one seems to be more elongated with respect to the ABS one,
which is practically flat. This behaviour is confirmed for both non-dimensional times f* = 27.0 in
figure 9a and f* = 31.5 in figure 9b.
