The variance per term within blocks containing d terms (or of length d) will be denoted
by R,. If/ is an integral multiple of d the sequence or function can be divided into blocks
without any residue, but in other cases there will be some residue. In any case, apart from
end-conditions, the location of the block divisions must be regarded as arbitrary, and a
somewhat more accurate estimate of R, (regardedas a feature of the material) will be obtained
if (in a sequence) all possible block divisions are taken.

The mean square of differences of terms d units apart (divided by 2 to bring it to a ‘per
term’ basis) will be denoted by D,. Again all possible differences of terms d units apart will
provide the best estimate of D,.

The value of R, can be estimated indirectly from the values of D,, s = 1,...,d—1. This
follows from the fact that the sum of the squares of the deviations of the d values y;, y», ..-
from their mean is equal to ae wy

This expression contains d—1 differences 1 unit apart, d—2 differences 2 units apart, etc.
Consequently an estimate of R, is given by
