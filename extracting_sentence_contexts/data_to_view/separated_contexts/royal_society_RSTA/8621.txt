The question of forces on fictitious magnetic poles moving in an electric field is
easily resolved by imparting to such poles a substantiality sufficient to allow us to talk
of forces on them, and then applying any of the general methods used in this theory. The Lagrangian function of the system is still of the form

L+ < | (BE?) de,

L being that part of it which is not directly determined by the conditions in the field
and which will as usual be assumed to be a function of the positions and velocities
of the electric and magnetic elements only. The sequence of changes is then best
described by the fact that the action integral

b Lf 2 2 ’
fia [n+ | (BE) av]

taken between fixed time limits is stationary subject to the implied conditions of the
field. If we assume generally that there are a number of discrete electric particles as
well in the field, these conditions may be written in the form

div E—47de = 0,
div (B—H)+472m = 0,

Curl H-+ gE _ its; = 0,

we - ag —4r Dm», = 0,
wherein e is the charge of the typical electron and y, its velocity, m is the strength of
the typical magnetic particle whose velocity is v,, and the sum Z in each equation is
taken per unit volume at each place over the respective elements indicated in it. We now introduce four undetermined Lagrangian multiplying functions, two scalar
quantities %, and ¢,, and two vector quantities A, and A,, it is thus the variation of
