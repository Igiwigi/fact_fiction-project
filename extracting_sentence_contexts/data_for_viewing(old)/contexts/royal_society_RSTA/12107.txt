(1.) Is independent of moderate changes of temperature ;

(2.) Is not due to the absorption or evaporation of water by the film ;

(3.) Is not due to a change in the composition of the liquid by e
decomposition produced by the current used to measure the resi
the film ;

(4.) Is not affected by a very large change in the quantity of carbonic ac
the air around the film.

(1.) The first of these statements is proved by such facts as the following. —
value of 8 (the apparent thickness of the black) was, on one occasion, 139 jp. ¥


THICKNESS AND ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF THIN LIQUID FILMS. 515

_ the temperature was 22°2 C. The same liquid on the same day gave B = 103 ape
at 18°, and, in the case of another film, 8 = 147 p.p. at 18°. In this case the
_yariations of 8B, when the temperature was constant, were greater than the change
which might otherwise have been attributed to a rise of 4° in temperature. Some-
times the larger value was found at the lower temperature. Thus, in one case, when

b= 26°°3 B = 135 pp.
