1.) These caps are fitted on to a shoulder of the dentine which is hollowed out
into a circumferential groove, so that, although the enamel cap is of material thick-
ness, it does not greatly increase the outside dimensions of the tooth. Whether
the enamel is confined to this cap or is continued down over the rest of the tooth
is a matter which becomes of some interest when the enamel organ of the tooth
germ is considered ; it might seem to be a very easy point to determine, but as
a matter of fact it is very difficult to be quite certain whether there is or is
not an exceedingly thin layer of distinct material surrounding a ground section
of any somewhat highly refractive substance, for optical effects due to the thick-
ness of the section often very closely simulate the existence of such a layer
where none actually exists. As, however, there is some appearance of an exceedingly
thin layer which is more brittle than the rest of the tooth, all that can safely be
said is, that if there be any enamel over the sides of the tooth it is not more
than 10» in thickness, #.¢., is exceedingly rudimentary, When subjected to the

action of an acid, the whole enamel cap quickly dissolves away, leaving only a mere
trace of organic residue, so that in the finished condition the enamel can contain but
a very small percentage of organic matter.
