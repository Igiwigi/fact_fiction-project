0?w/dx? and 0?w/dy?, and thence of the integrands in (27) ;* then, the latter were employed
to effect the double integration. Computations were made in this manner for both
sizes of net, ‘four-strip’ formulae being employed in both instances for the differentia-
tions, and ‘four-strip’ and ‘six-strip’ formulae, respectively, for integration on the
coarser and on the finer net.

The results (table 6) are highly satisfactory. The finer net still yields a higher value
for A than the coarser, thus confirming the conjectured explanation; but this value
agrees within one part in 400, both with the coarse-net value and with Schleicher’s. It thus
appears that critical loadings can be calculated with amply sufficient accuracy, and
without proceeding to very fine nets, from Bickley’s formulae applied on the basis of Ray-
leigh’s principle. The mode too can be closely estimated, and the supplementary
calculations are not necessary when (as will usually be the fact) an estimate of A can be
tolerated which is foo low by some 6 %,

Example 2. Rectangular strip sustaining bending moments accompanied by shear

29. Our second example (figure 11) relates to a stress system of considerably greater
complexity, generally representative of the stresses induced by bending moment
combined with shear force in the web of a deep plate girder. It is shown (e.g. in South-
well 1936, §§ 413-6) that the biharmonic stress function
