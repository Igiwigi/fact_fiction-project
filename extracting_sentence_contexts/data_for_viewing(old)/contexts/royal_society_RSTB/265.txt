(19, p. 163), but by this he appears to mean nothing more than that it is derived

from the splanchnic peritoneum, which he believes to be continued into the stem.

We have now traced the organogeny of the cystid up to the time that the vestibule
opens to the exterior. Many points in its anatomy have been correctly described by
previous observers, and have only been introduced here for the sake of clearness ; but
in other points the preceding description differs considerably from those of previous
writers ; and to the discussion of these differences we must now turn our attention.

That the two longitudinal mesenteries have hitherto escaped notice is, I believe,
due to the fact that neither GÃ©rrn, Lupwic, nor Pserrier cut transverse sections.
So far as these two mesenteries were seen by these observers, they appear to have
been either confused with the axial organ, or explained in some other way. Thus
PeERRIER (19. p. 142) describes the oral body-cavity as pushing its way down in the
angle of the alimentary canal, and so driving before it that part of the tranverse
mesentery which I have described as breaking down. To him, therefore, the cavity
into which the axial organ projects is part of the oral body-cavity, while to me it
is part of the aboral cavity, freely open above to the oral cavity. But the process
described by Perrier should lead to the formation of two aboral longitudinal
mesenteries, whereas transverse sections clearly show that only one is present (fig. 31).

Part of the oral longitudinal mesentery was undoubtedly seen by Lupwie, who
regarded it as an incomplete partition separating off that part of the body-cavity into
