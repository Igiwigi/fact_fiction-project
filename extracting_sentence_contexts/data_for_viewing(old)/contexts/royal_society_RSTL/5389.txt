1" 22", and I have subsequently seen them alive in the chamber for a longer period.

At 1 30” the two bodies differed somewhat in character, and one was before the
other: the anterior or granulous one appeared to have a distinct membrane, and to

one in the eggs of Fxogena Qfrstedii, which he at first looked upon as the embryo cell (in Einige Worte zur
Entwickelungsgeschichte yon Punice, Nachworte von A. K6LLxEr in Zurich, Navenberg, 1846, note).
QraTREFAGEs also has noticed one in Hermella (Ann. des Sciences Nat. 3 s&rie, tom. x. 1848, p. 177. pl. 3.
fig. xv. xviii.), and more recently Vax Bzxzpen has seen and figured one in the eggs of a Cestoid worm,
Echineibothrium variabile (Mem, de VAcad. de Bruxelles, tom. xxv. p. 68, pl. 3. fig. 15. 1850). Thus the
existence in many Invertebrata of at least one detached spherical body on the surface of the fecundated yelk,
before segmentation, seems to point to the conclusion that these bodies haye some important signification with
reference to the future embryo. QuaTzerAGes, who has recently directed attention to the fact of their
occurrence, properly remarks, that their presence at this stage of development of the egg is much more general
than it has hitherto been supposed.

These bodies have been seen equally in the Vertebrata as in the Invertebrata. In the Vertebrata they appear
to have been first noticed, but entirely misunderstood, by Dr. MarTix Barsy in the Rabbit. Although repeat-
edly een and figured by him (Philosophical 'Transactions, 1840, p. 538, Plates XXIV. XXV. and XXVI.,
figs. 185, 186, 187 and 193, 200, 206, 209, 212), imagining that the germinal vesicle does not disappear before,
but only changes its form, becomes enlarged, and takes the place of the yelk, subsequent to fecundation, he
conceived that these spherical bodies were the remains of the yelk, or, as he terms it, © 8ubsfance” (p. 538),
which he supposed had undergone diszolution and disappeared. Professor Brscuoxy however, having noticed
these bodies in the egg of the Rabbit (MiLLEz's Archiv, 1841, p. 14. tab, 1. fig. 6), directed particular atten-
tion to them (Entwickelungsgeschichte des Kaninchen-Eies, 4to. 1842, tab. 2. fig. 17 b, figs. 19, 20), and
