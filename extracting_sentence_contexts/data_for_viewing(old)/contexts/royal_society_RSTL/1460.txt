possessed of a weak negative electricity; for it required more
than thirty turns of the revolving plate to effect a good charge,
whereas in the privy (which is at a small distance from. the
heap of leaves) the doubler became strongly charged with less
than half that number of turns, and with the same kind of
electricity. This, indeed, I expected would have been the
case, because I have always observed the doubler to give ne-
gative electricity in a privy ; but that the rotten leaves should
be able to maintain that electric state in the open air, is truly
wonderful, when it is considered that the surrounding atino-
spherical electricity was of the positive kind, and rather strong-
ly 80, both by the doubler and the high pointed rod. I am of
opinion that I should not have given due attention to this fact,
if it had not s0 happened that the doubler had not been used
for near two weeks before; it was therefore evident, that it

must have been wholly deprived of every particle of its former
charge.

The day after this, the heap of leaves was laid open, and
every twig and leaf exhibited a covering of white mould; but
after this, the doubler always gave the same kind of electricity
