and under the pressure of the water assumed the folded form so characteristic of the
umbrella-mouthed tadpoles of Megalophrys under water. Even the dise of a lamprey,
when not in action, is folded in a vertical wedge-shaped fashion (Dawson, 1905, p. 91).

The so-called changed conditions require further explanation. The continuous
increase in the size of the lips must have been brought about by a continuous flow of
water of increasing swiftness. Now suppose that on account of some change in the
meteorology of the place the perennial streams become intermittent, liable either to
break up into a series of pools and puddles which may dry up altogether or become rapid
torrents generated by a single shower (such is the habitat of the funnel-mouthed larve).
The tempestuous waters of torrents contain a high percentage of dissolved oxygen and it
is known that animals tend to reduce their respiratory organs under such a condition.
Tn fact, Dopps and Hisaw (‘ Ecology,’ V, pp. 262-271, 1924a) have been able to show a
“definite correlation between gill area and oxygen content of the water.” So when
these tadpoles with reduced gills were left in pools and puddles with an ever-decreasing
quantity of oxygen dissolved in the water, they would naturally come to the surface
for inhaling the atmospheric air, and this habit would ultimately lead to the lungs
becoming once more functional for respiration.

* Regarding the habitat of the two types of tadpoles of Phyllobates, Dunn (1924, p. 11) remarks as
follows: “ These two sorts of tadpoles were common in the stream at La Loma. Those of latinasus were
similar to Rana tadpoles in appearance and in actions. The tadpoles of talamance seemed to remain in
the deepest parts of the pools and were very active and darter-like in their movements.” So there is a
close similarity between the habitats of the funnel-mouthed tadpoles of Phyllobates and Megalophrys,
