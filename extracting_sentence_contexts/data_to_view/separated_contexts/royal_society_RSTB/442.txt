Ordinarily the entire interior of the sporangium
is occupied by the spores, but in each of the two examples g, g, of fig. 2, we find the
peripheral end prolonged beyond the spores, and the small space thus produced is
occupied by an extremely delicate form of parenchyma. From the two sporangia f’, f’,
we further learn that this parenchyma is but an extension into the sporangium of the
delicate cellular tissue occupying the interior of the sporangium. The uppermost of the
above two is further magnified in fig. 16, The first fact to be noted here is that the
recurved sporangiophore, f, has enlarged as it approached the sporangium, g, from a
diameter of -001, its size at its proximal end, to 0133. At the same time the cells
of its outermost or epidermal layer have become much more conspicuously differen-
tiated from the delicate parenchyma, f’, which they enclose. We further see that the
wall of the sporangium is not only continuous with that of the sporangiophore, but
that the one is merely an extension of the other.
