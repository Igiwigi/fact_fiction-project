Four other species of Cardium were examined (Cardium echinatum, Cardium
(Fragum) unedo, Cardium (Fragum) hemicardium, Cardium (Levicardium) nor-
vegicum). Their gills do not differ materially from those of Cardiwm edule. The
principal filaments are less variable in shape, and the general form of their frontal
surface is that of a broad shallow groove. In Cardium norvegicum the plice are
antero-posteriorly compressed, and the subfilamentar tissue tends to form trabeculie
between the anterior and posterior sides of the plica. In Cardium hemicardium the

interlamellar extensions of the filaments were found to be greatly dilated, but this
may possibly be due to the fact that the mode of killing caused the gills to become
gorged with blood. .
The gills of Cardissa cardissa (Hemicardium cardissa) have about twenty-four |
filaments to the plica. The principal filaments are not much larger than the ordinary
filaments ; their frontal surface has the form of a shallow ridge,
Serripes groenlandicum has 12-14 filaments to the plica in the outer demibranch,
and 20-22 in the inner. The principal filaments have a deep frontal groove, which
is broadest at its base. Near the lower border of the demibranch, however, the
groove disappears, and the frontal surface has the form of a moderately sharp ridge.

Tridacnide.
Tridacna elongala has plicee of considerable size (about eighty filaments), antero-
posteriorly compressed so as to resemble the leaves of a book. All the interlamellar
