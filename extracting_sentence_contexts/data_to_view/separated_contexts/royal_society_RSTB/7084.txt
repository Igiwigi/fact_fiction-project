In sharp contrast to ‘sampling fluctuations’ and ‘observational errors’ of the type
described above, inaccuracies have also arisen from false entries or deliberate failure to
carry out instructions. (As already mentioned, in the case of the jute survey the field work
has to be carried out under trying weather conditions when moving about in villages is
difficult. In this situation some of the field investigators put down entries by pure guess work
without taking the trouble of going round the field. This risk is increased by the fact that most
of the investigators are employed only for ten or twelve weeks so that there is no permanent
hold on them.) The theoretical distinction between the second type of observational errors
and the third type of gross inaccuracies is quite clear. Observational errors are amenable
to statistical treatment. False entries and inaccuracies arising from gross negligence, on the
other hand, are not amenable to statistical or probabilistic treatment.
