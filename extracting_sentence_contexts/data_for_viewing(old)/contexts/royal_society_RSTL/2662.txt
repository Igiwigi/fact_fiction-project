30. This simple induction of facts appears sufficiently conclusive ; it clearly shows
that a spherical conductor, either hollow or solid, and a plate of equal area, have the
same electrical capacity, and that CouLomse's experiments are not opposed to such a
conclusion.

31. We may now proceed to consider the case of an insulated body plunged within
an electrified sphere, and this will necessarily lead to some further inquiries into the
action of the proof plane, and to the conditions under which one substance receives
electricity from another.

The curious fact that we do not abstract any portion of the charge accumulated on
a hollow sphere by touching its interior surface with an insulated neutral disc placed
wholly within it, will, on inquiry, be found little conclusive of the non-existence of
electricity upon that surface ; it may be experimentally shown that any insulated body
plunged within an electrified shell, could not possibly take up a particle of electricity,
even although a powerful accumulation actually existed there.

Eaperiment L,—Let a 8mall sphere of glass a «, fig. 22, made clean and dry, baving
a projecting neck at «a varnished with shell lac, be nearly filled with dry mercury,
and Jet the whole be placed in a vessel þ Þ', also containing mercury, $0 as to give
the glass an outer and inner coating ; charge this system, and remove the charging
