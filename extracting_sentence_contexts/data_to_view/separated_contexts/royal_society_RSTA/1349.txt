So w belongs to the group, as
required. 13.7. The operation may be regarded as a product PQ, in which each of P, Q is of
period 2; Q being in fact

(16) (25) (34). This is seen at once by applying to each of X, Y, Z (of which no two have a line in
common) the obvious decomposition of a cyclic permutation of period 9,
(123456789) = (17) (26) (35) (89) .
