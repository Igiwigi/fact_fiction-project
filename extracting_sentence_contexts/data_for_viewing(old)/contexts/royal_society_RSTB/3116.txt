pollination, According to Lorsts* the “pollination” (of @. Gnemon) “takes place mostly
through the action of the wind, though it may be that insects playa réle in it.” Jaccarpt
finds that in Ephedra helvetica the wind is the principal pollinating agent, and that
“Je réle joué par les insectes y est purement fortuit. Les quelques insectes qui
visitent les fleurs de l'Ephedra sont surtout attirés par les gouttes sucrées qui perlent
au sommet des bractées des bourgeons floriféres.” It thus appears that pollination is
not entirely anemophilous in any one of the genera.

Interest in the agency by which pollination is effected in living gymnosperms has
become greater in consequence of the observation that the cupule of the paleozoic
seed Lagenostoma Lomaxi was furnished with glands, which may have been
associated with insect-visits.{ It is probable that anemophily is not so general in
the group as is commonly supposed. The fact that the mature male cones of species
of Encephalartos and Cycas possess a very offensive and penetrating odour is in
confirmation of Hooxer’s suggestion§ that entomophily occurs among the Cycads.
This question, and many others of great interest in connection with the biology
of the gymnosperms, can only be settled by the study of living plants in their natural
habitats.

Hooker records that ‘the cones are often bored through and through after the
manner of flower-buds attacked by the larve of Curculionide.”|| This is no doubt
the work of a large hemipteron, Odontopus sexpunctulatus, Cast., which is found
on almost every inflorescence, usually in considerable numbers. It has a proboscis
4 inch or more long. No specimens were seen on any other plant. Baines found
this “red and yellow field-bug” on Welwitschia at Haikamchab in 1864, and
