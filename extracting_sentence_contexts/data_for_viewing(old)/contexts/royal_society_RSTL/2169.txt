This salt was not affected by moderately strong nitric or
nitro-muriatic acid, even when boiled with them; and no
precipitation of sulphate took place. When the acids were
very strong, peculiar and complicated results were obtained.
When put into an atmosphere of chlorine, at common tem-
peratures, it was not at all affected by it. Heat being applied,
an action between the naphthaline evolved, and chlorine,
such as might be expected, took place.

When a strong solution of the pure acid was poured into
a strong solution of muriate of baryta, a precipitate was
formed, in consequence of the production of this salt. It was
re-dissolved by the addition of water. The fact indicates
that the affinity of this acid for baryta is stronger than that
of muriatic acid.


and naphthaline, and on a new acid produced. 153

The second, or glowing salt of baryta, was obtained in small
crystalline groups. The crystals were prismatic, colourless,
and transparent: they were almost tasteless, and by no
means $0 soluble either in hot or cold water as the former
salts. They were soluble in alcohol, and the $solutions were
perfectly neutral. When heated on platinum foil they gave
