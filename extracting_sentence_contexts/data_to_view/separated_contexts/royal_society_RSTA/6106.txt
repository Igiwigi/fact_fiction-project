The in-band gain is
set by capacitive and resistive dividers according to equation (4.2) in table 3. To maximize the
gain and reduce distortion (i.e. to widen the flat portion of the TFs by making f,1 small and f,2
high), Ramp, Ryjseal and Cnano should be large, and Cstray and Camp small according to equations
(4.4) and (4.5). In fact, a low fy (e.g. for large values of the sealing resistance) filters out the high-
frequency signal components, thus slowing the Vout transients and making it appear spread out
