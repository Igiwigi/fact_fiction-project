together with three similar solutions. |
To investigate the relation between the solutions, (8:1) may also be solved in terms of
Barnes’s integrals. Consider, for example, the Barnes integral

1,(u) = 5 l. (s4-p,—1)! (64+-p_—1)! (s+ Pp—1)! (8-+h4— 1)! 0-8 ds

where C,, is one of the paths of figure | starting and finishing at infinity in the negative half-
plane. It can easily be shown that /(w) satisfies the differential equation (8-1); this will,
in fact, be shown by (8-4). The poles of the integrand are at the points

Consider the five paths C = Cy, C,, C,, C;, C; as in figure 1, and denote the corresponding
integrals by J), J, J, J,, 1, respectively. Then
