A large water-cooled coil capable of carrying a current of about 20 amps. was
therefore made for this purpose. A definite lower limit was set for the inner diameter
of the coil by the fact that the coil had to pass up round the cryostat, and the question
of ease of handling of the coil set a limit to the weight and hence to the outer diameter
and axial length of the coil, A design for the coil was therefore got out in the light of
these limitations, taking also into account the necessity for H dH/dx being as great
as possible. The coil was very carefully and accurately constructed and its dimensions
