+ The © roads” have no doubt been raised generally by snbaerial d6bris, while the cols may also have
been raised a few feet by the acenmulation of oil since the lake waters passed over them,

It would appear therefore from the want of agreement between the levels of the
*roads” and of the cols, and from the want of horizontality in the lines of the * roads”
that they cannot be referred to the definite zones of an established and uniform water-
level, regulated by the height of the cols, and combined with long continued shore action.
The facts admit however of ready explanation on the principle that the momentum of
the sliding mass of detritus, varying necessarily according to the angle of slope, would,
in those cases where the slopes were greatest—other conditions being alike—carry
that body below the surface of the water ; while in other cases where the slopes were
less, it proved insufficient to effect the degcent quite to that level. Or the difference in
the slide might have been due to the lesser rapidity with which the level of the lake
fell. Thus the height of * road” No. 4, which is always above the level of the escape-
col at Makoul, may have arisen from the slopes of the hill at that level being, on the
whole, 8omewhat less steep than ab the higher *'roads;” or the main cause may have
been the slower discharge of the water arising from the vastly greater size of the lake,
while the pass was no wider, if 80 wide.

The diminished momentum on lesser slopes may also be one canse why the © roads,”
