Among all the crystals studied by us, manganese ammonium sulphate has the smallest
magnetic anisotropy. ‘The difference between the maximum and the minimum principal
susceptibilities is only 11-4, in a mean susceptibility of 13830,; 7.¢., 0-08 of one per cent,
of the mean value. (Che value of Ay/z calculated from Rast’s absolute measurements
is about 1 per cent.) It is almost of the order of diamagnetic anisotropy. This is
clearly what we should expect from the fact that the ground state of the Mnt* ion is
an S-state.* For the same reason, the crystal may be expected to obey the simple
Curte law. Our mean value for the susceptibility would then correspond to a magnetic
moment for the Mn** ion of 29-0 Wxiss magnetons, as against the value 29-4 calculated
from the spin moments of the five electrons in the outermost shell.

The nickel salts are also feebly anisotropic, the values of Ay/y varying from 2 to 4 per
cent. in the different compounds. This has been discussed in detail by Van ViEcK
(particularly in relation to the strong anisotropy of the cobalt salts), on the basis of
Burun’s calculations regarding the splitting of the atomic energy levels in these crystals.
In conformity with the results of the theory, we find that the mean susceptibilities of the
various nickel salts, after correcting for their diamagnetism, are practically the same,
corresponding to a magnetic moment of 15-8 Weiss magnetons for the Ni** ion.
