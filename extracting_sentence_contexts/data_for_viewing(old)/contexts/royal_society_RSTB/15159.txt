Light pollution, or artificial light at night (ALAN), is increasingly considered
one of the most pervasive forms of global environmental change [1]. A large
proportion of the planet is now exposed to artificially lit skies at night, and
the global extent and pervasiveness of ALAN is increasing at a rate of more
than 9% per year [2]. This is concerning for nearly all life on the Earth, as
most organisms have evolved in reliable light-dark environments, with daily,
lunar and seasonal light cycles that regulate critical biological processes [3].
Marine environments are not exempt from this largely land-based pollutant.
Both direct sources of light (e.g. from marine infrastructure, coastal lighting) and
skyglow (lighting emitted or reflected upwards, scattered in the atmosphere
and reflected back to the Earth’s surface; [4]) from urban centres contribute to
the artificial light that can disrupt marine life in coastal habitats. In fact, ALAN
from coastal developments reaches more than 22% of the world’s near-shore
environments [5]. An estimated 1.6 million km” of the world’s coastal seas are
