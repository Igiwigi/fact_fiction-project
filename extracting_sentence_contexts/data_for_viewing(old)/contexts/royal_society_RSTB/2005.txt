THE HEAT-CONTRACTION OF SKELETAL MUSCLE. 145

and again stimulated. This warming and cooling was repeated three times. On
examining his records we noted that after each warming the height of contraction
was markedly diminished, showing that recovery was far from complete, a conclusion
confirmed by several other experiments of the same nature.

The best explanation of these various results seems to be that, on the one hand,
soluble myogen-fibrin is not rapidly precipitated at a temperature of 34°°5 C., and, on
the other hand, that the fact that some of it is coagulated in a muscle does not
prevent that muscle from contracting when stimulated, though the amount of the
contraction becomes distinctly restricted. The presence of soluble myogen-fibrin
appears to be a necessary condition of the contraction of frog’s muscle, for we have
always obtained a heat-contraction at 35° C. in those cases where a small amount of
irritability persisted after the previous application of heat, which was sufficient to
2 produce incomplete heat-contraction.

Heat-contraction is a process quite distinct from the ordinary Contraction of Muscle.

That heat-contraction and the normal contraction of muscle are quite distinct
; processes, is well brought out by studying the effect of heat upon a fatigued muscle.
We found that a completely fatigued muscle, when heated, gave contractions quite
