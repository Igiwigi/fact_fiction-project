The potential of gravity is —g~ Hence the lost
energy is

~p || 9a¢de =-4p| glao. Accordingly the lost energy is equal and opposite to the work done in raising the
layer, considered as surface density, through half its thickness, against gravity. We may take as a typical term

£= pfiPi(p) Ci (4),

and we have shown in (13) that

It should be noted that this expression for gravity takes no account of the change
in the ellipticity of e which is due to the fact that H is an ellipsoid and not a sphere. The error introduced thus is however outside the limits of accuracy which have been
adopted. Accordingly this portion of the lost energy is
