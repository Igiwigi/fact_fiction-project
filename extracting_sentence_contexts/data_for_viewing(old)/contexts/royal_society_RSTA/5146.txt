and uncontrolled cases, respectively. The term rp(f) represents the relative power loss and it is
computed as

rp(6)=1— Pere, (3.7)
Potr

where Petr and Punctr denote the mechanical power generated by the turbine in the controlled
and uncontrolled cases, respectively. The term A is a scalar, and 4 and 1—2 are the weights used
for the vibration reduction ratio and power loss ratio, respectively. To solve this Pareto-optimal
optimization problem with only two variables, it is possible to carry out a numerical analysis with
a discrete search technique by sampling the values over the possible ranges of F and 6. However,
even in that case, the total computation time may be significant. To avoid the computationally
intensive approach, a simpler technique is followed by exploiting the fact that the power loss is
independent of the tendon tension F (figure 5c) and hence rp(f) is a function only of f. Further,
it can be observed from figure 5 that, to achieve the maximum possible vibration reduction or to
minimize the vibrational response, the maximum value of F = Fmax should be used (since F has
no impact on power production). Hence, the first term in (3.5) is a function of f as F is known.
Thus, the first and second terms in the objective function in (3.5) can be expressed as

gi=1—ry,,.(B) and g2=rp(A), (3.8)

where gj and go are functions of 8. Using figure 5a,c, the functions g) and g» can be regressed by
polynomial functions for ease of representation and subsequent optimization calculations. Hence,
the minimal value of the objective function is obtained by satisfying the condition
