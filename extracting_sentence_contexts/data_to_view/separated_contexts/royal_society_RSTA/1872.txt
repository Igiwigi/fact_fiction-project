Each martialed and organized masses of empirical evidence into simple,
graphical modelsâ€”a tree and a table. Each of them did so long before there was full empirical
evidence to show that their constructs were correct. The facts that followed are not what defined
their accomplishments as so fundamental to their respective disciplines. Rather, the reverse is
true. Their contributions, built on imperfect and incomplete facts, synthesized those facts into
coherent organizing principles that guided the efforts of those who followed.
