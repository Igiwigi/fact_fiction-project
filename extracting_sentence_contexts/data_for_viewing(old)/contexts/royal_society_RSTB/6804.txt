with a mild crinkle and interveinal mottle; at other times with an interveinal necrosis
and leaf-drop similar to but less severe than that exhibited by the members of Group I.

Group III.

The varieties Arran Banner I$, G4, Ballydoon G+, Doon Star G } react to A
with a relatively mild interveinal mottle.

Group IV.

Eclipse. Thirteen examples of Eclipse were infected with X%. All belonged to the
same clone and were from glasshouse stocks supposedly free from all virus infection,
in fact these stocks have been tested each year and have been found free of any known
virus. Inasmuch as X” was only discovered in 1936 it is not possible to be certain as to
whether they were free of.it prior to this date; six were specifically examined for the
presence of the masked strain or X” prior to the experiment. This was done by
inoculating the sap to Datura and reinoculating the latter 10 days later with X%. In
four of these the examination was negative; in the fifth the possibility of a trace of X#
could not be excluded. In this latter case on the reinoculation of the Datura with X¥
there resulted a few faintly necrotic local lesions and a systemic infection more like
that produced by X4 than X%. In the sixth example the Daturas developed similar
local lesions to the last but no systemic infection. Both results indicate that there must
have been present a certain amount of a weaker strain in the original potato, but that
it was so small in quantity that it had not had time to multiply sufficiently to infect the
entire Datura before the reinoculation with X* took place.
