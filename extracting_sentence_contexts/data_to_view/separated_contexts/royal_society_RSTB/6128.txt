It is more probable that some of the females have produced two puparia by that
time, than that the reproductive life of some of them begins very late. The results
obtained with Glossina submorsitans are essentially the same. From these facts one
may conclude that a proportion of the females of both species are probably sterile. The matter is of considerable importance to the laboratory worker, and requires
fuller study. The conditions under which stocks of Glossina can be maintained in the laboratory
are now beginning to be clear ;_ the limiting conditions of temperature and humidity
are discussed in the present paper.
