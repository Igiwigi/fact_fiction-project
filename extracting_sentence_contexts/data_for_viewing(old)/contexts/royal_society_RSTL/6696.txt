character, of which I could cite many, were not calculated to promote incautiousness or
rashness on my part. I say very clearly how easy it was to fall into the gravest errors,
and I took due precautions to prevent myself from doing 80.

Knowing that a solution of salt was almost as opake to radiant heat as water itself,
I was careful to examine whether the effects which I had observed with aqueous vapour
might not be due to the precipitation of the vapour on the surfaces of the plates of

salt used to stop my tube. The snbstance is well known to be very hygroscopic, and
during the last three years the knowledge of this fact has rendered me careful to remove
my polished plates every evening from the apparatus, and to keep them in perfectly dry
air, Still, when it is remembered that the air on entering the tube is raised in tempe-
rature, and thus enabled to maintain a greater amount of vapour, and that the tube and
Y plates of rock-salt form the channel for a flux of heat from the radiating source, the
F likelihood of precipitation occurring will seem but small. On examining the plates
after the undried air of the laboratory was experimented with, no trace of precipitated
moisture was observed upon their surfaces.

But to place the matter beyoud all doubt, I abolished the plates of rock-salt altoge-

S a T-piece, with the cocks Q Q', was attached. The cock Q' was connected with two
£ tubes, U' U', each of which was filled with fragments of glass moistened with distilled
