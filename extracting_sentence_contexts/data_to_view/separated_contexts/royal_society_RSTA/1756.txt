This intrinsic yield for the DT fusion is about 300, which is a large number by itself but,
unfortunately, insufficient for compensating the losses related to incomplete fuel burn (typically
30%), heating and compression efficiency (typically less than 10%), energy conversion efficiency
(less than 40% for a thermal process) and the laser driver efficiency (today of a few per cent). A fusion yield in the inertial process can be significantly increased by using the ‘hot spot’
ignition scheme. In fact, not all fuel needs to be heated to the ignition temperature, but only a
small fraction, called the hot spot, which initiates the burn in a cold fuel shell. The energy released
in the hot spot should be sufficient to compensate losses and to further increase its temperature
and to trigger a burn wave in the cold fuel. This condition provides a criterion on the hot spot areal
density and temperature similar to the Lawson criterion in magnetic fusion [2,3].
