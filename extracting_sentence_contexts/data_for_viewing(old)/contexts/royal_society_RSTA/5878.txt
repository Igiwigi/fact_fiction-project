(k) The hot big bang

But at the time of the inhomogeneous studies of Lifshitz, even in the homogeneous picture the
last word had not been said yet. It was not until 1948 that G. Gamow [48] and two of his students,
R. Alpher and R. Herman, proposed that the early universe was not only very dense but also very hot 1B
and showed that in such a universe the ratio of the matter density to the cube of the temperature :
of heat radiation is a constant (see [49,50] for an insightful presentation of their findings).

Hence, if one measured that density and ratio today, they could find the present temperature :
of the leftover radiation. The authors gave an estimate of this temperature about 5 degrees :s
Kelvin, but no one gave any serious attention to this result back then and went completely :
unnoticed, despite the fact that this prediction was no other than that of the later discovered a
cosmic microwave background thermal radiation left from a very early stage, the hot big bang, in â€”
the evolution of the homogeneous universe. a)

This is a tremendous result equivalent to the discovery of a radiation era in the early universe Dh
with density exceeding that of matter. Also, this radiation survives until today with a much D8
cooler temperature. It took more than 15 years until the cosmic microwave background radiation, [<3
observationally discovered by Penzias and Wilson in 1965, convincingly explained by R. Dicke
and his group the same year, and accurately measured to be isotropic as late as 1967.

This discovery was perhaps the single most important one in theoretical cosmology as it
established it as a physical science (see [2], chap. 4, for a very detailed analysis of the various
developments in the long period leading to this discovery). It also led, with the help of particle
