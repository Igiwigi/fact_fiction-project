At the time when the estimate of the amount of alteration of period of the line in
Sirius Was made, the earth was moving from the star with a velocity of about 12 miles
T second. © There remains unaccounted for a motion of recession from the earth amounting to 29:4
miles per 8econd, which we appear to be entitled to attribute to Sirius. It may be not unnecessary to state that the solar motion in space, if accepted as a
© fact, will not materially affect this result, since, according to M. Orro STRuUvE's calcu-
Z lations, the advance of the sun in space takes place with a velocity but little greater than
2 one-fourth of the earth's motion in its orbit. If the apex of the solar motion be situated
S in Hercules, nearly the whole of it will be from Sirius, and will therefore diminish the
S velocity to be ascribed to that star. S
