They confirmed in striking fashion that the upper part of a thunderstorm is

always positively charged and the main portion of the base negatively charged. They,
however, also obtained a few records which were interpreted as indicating a positively
charged region in the base of the cloud. The evidence consists essentially in the fact
that in the few cases when a balloon was released beneath a storm in a region of positive
potential gradient, the gradient never remained positive all the way up to the positive

charge at the top of the cloud. While the existence of a positive charge near the base
of the cloud is the most direct and perhaps the most natural interpretation of such
a record, such a conclusion is by no means inevitable. In the first place, the balloon
takes about 30 min. to rise through the cloud and thus the temporal variations of the
charges have not been eliminated.
