At of = 90° E, has a
strong southerly current, E, a weaker southerly current and E, practically zero current,
while D, has a small northerly current. These observational facts agree well with
fig. 7. Station Da, has a westerly current at of = 0 and a northerly current at ot = 90°,
which facts agree well with figs. 4 and 7 respectively. Station Da, has a flood parallel to the shore at ot = 75°, which is in good agreement
with fig. 11, and the behaviour of a progressive wave. Station E, has a flood parallel to the shore at of = 150° agreeing with fig. 11, and a
current towards the shore a quarter period before high water, in accordance with Arry’s
tule,

Station E; has an easterly current at of = 180° and a northerly current at of = 90°
in agreement with figs. 6 and 10 respectively.
