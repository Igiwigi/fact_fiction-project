It is clear from table 2 that most of the phosphorus compound is absorbed during growth
and removed from solution in spite of the fact that Calgon is a very soluble material. Indeed
the effect is most noteworthy when the Calgon is present at the lowest concentrations. Table 3 gives the results of calculations (based on the data of table 2) showing the P,O,
contents of solution and solid phases in the various experiments, correlated with the various
modes of precipitation of calcium carbonate which have already been described.

of the precipitation as hexahydrate (in CaCO,.6H,O)

These results bring out the fact that although striking effects on crystal growth are
obtained from solutions containing extremely small concentrations of Calgon, the con-
centration of additive in the solid is appreciable. The distribution of Calgon between the
solution and the growing solid appears to show a high degree of adsorption which is
followed by trapping of the additive. (e) Effect of Calgon in the absence of spherical seed grains
