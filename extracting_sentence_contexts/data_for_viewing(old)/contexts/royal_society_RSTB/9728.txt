The extensive reciprocal cooperation with changing
partners required by the human foraging niche and fissionâ€”
fusion sociality [8] was probably facilitated by a further co-
option of OT to increase prosocial disposition and motivate
the establishment and regulation of cooperative relationships
with new partners. Indeed, prosociality increases following
OT administration in a variety of economic games mimicking
resource-sharing contexts [24,61]. Additionally, experimental
evidence suggests that both endogenous release of OT [62]
and exogenously administered OT make individuals more will-
ing to trust their partners in economic games [25]. In this
context, the fact that the appropriate level of investment in the
relationship, exemplified by trust (i.e. the belief that a social
