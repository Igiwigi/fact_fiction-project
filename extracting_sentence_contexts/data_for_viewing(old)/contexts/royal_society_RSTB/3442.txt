3. Marrry* first set on a sure foundation the knowledge of the action of snake
venoms on blood coagulability by his experiments with Pseudechis venom. He showed
that, when administered intravenously, this venom produces intravascular clotting if
injected rapidly and in sufficient amount, whereas if injected slowly it may produce
a condition in which the blood cannot be made to clot by further additions of venom,
however great.

Metianpyt demonstrated the production of the positive and negative phases of
coagulability in regard to Echis venom, and as the result of a long series of
experiments, he came to the conclusion that the active coagulating principle of this
venom consists of pure kinase. When injected intravenously, or when added to
blood in vitro, this kinase produces a positive phase of coagulability. His explana-
tion of the negative phase is ingenious and well explains the known facts. He
considers that when the venom is injected very slowly the formation of fibrin is
not sufficiently rapid or complete to cause intravascular clotting, but that the fibrin
is formed in such minute quantities that it can be removed by the tissue cells; and
thus, if a sufficient amount of venom be slowly injected, all the fibrinogen is removed
from the blood and, therefore, further coagulation is impossible until such a time
as the fibrinogen is regenerated in the blood.

With regard to our experiments with Echis venom, it is noteworthy that,
although in.a rabbit so small an amount as 0:0001 grm. per kilogramme produces
immediate death from intravascular clotting if injected intravenously, a dose of
0:005 grm. per kilogramme does not produce intravascular clotting if injected
subcutaneously. On MrLLANBYâ€™s explanation, it seems necessary to assume from
