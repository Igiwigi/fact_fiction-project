The ensemble-average growth rates of x;(t) under equation (2.1) and y(t) under equation
(3.9) are identical: 4. From this perspective, there is no incentive to cooperate. Moreover, an
entity that realizes a large positive resource change during a growth phase, equation (3.3), could
keep its fortuitous gain by breaking the cooperative pact, without altering its ensemble-average
growth rate. Thus, analysing the growth of the ensemble average of resources gives no reason
for cooperation to arise and, if it does arise, a good reason for it to end. From this perspective,
cooperation looks fragile at best and its frequent observation in nature seems puzzling.

The solution of the puzzle requires a change in perspective. The ensemble-average growth rate
is uninformative of the growth of a single entity (or, indeed, any finite cooperative) over time.
From the perspective of an individual, it is the growth rate achieved by averaging over infinitely
many parallel realizations of its resources—an irrelevant fiction. It is more realistic to assume that
an individual cares about its time-average growth rate, which better approximates what it will
actually achieve in one resource trajectory over time.

We know from equation (2.8) that the time-average growth rate for non-cooperating entities is
8(xj) =" - o*/2. Under cooperative dynamics, equation (3.9), the volatility decreases from a to
a//N, which when substituted into equation (2.8) yields a higher time-average growth rate,

xy) =p - IN’ (4.1)

So, in the presence of fluctuations, o > 0, cooperators grow faster than non-cooperators in the
long run. The growth rate premium increases with the number of cooperators as 1 — 1/N,
