In
contrast to the fish subjected to Condition (i) above, in these fish there was a marked
change in the interstitium, the interstitial and connective tissues becoming well
developed, and the fish developing the secondary sexual characters. In these fish the
new spermatogenesis occurred in outgrowths of the anterior tubules. A careful exami-
nation of the testis with these anterior outgrowths has convinced me that this apparent
special hypertrophy of the anterior tubules is due, not to any specific effect of the
experiment, but to the fact that there is in the testis with the interstitium developed,
no space for the increased volume consequent on fresh spermatogenesis, and the tubules
burst out of the usual limits of the testis at its weakest point. This weak point is
situated anteriorly where the connective tissue sheath of the testis is thinnest. In
the case of the fish subjected to Condition (i), the lymph spaces of the interstitium
provided the necessary space for the expansion of the tubules.
