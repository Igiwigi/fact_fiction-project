If we take (ABCD) = 11 we get set,(3). All three sets are consistent with the set
of third order, and possess equality of contraries. The state of affairs is precisely the
opposite of that illustrated by Table I1., where only one set of third order frequencies
could be obtained, consistent with the given set of the second order, and possessing
equality of contraries.*

It should be noted, however, that the possible number of fourth order sets in such
a case as the present is not infinite, for certain limits are imposed by the fact that
negative frequencies are impossible. Thus, if we take

(ABCD) = 60
we have
(ABC) = 58 — 60 = — 2
or if (ABCD) = 3
(ABC8) = 58 — 3 = 55
(ABy8) = 538 — 55 = — 2,

so (ABCD) must lie at all events between the limits 58 and 5.

§ 13. It follows from what we have proved that a state of complete equality of
contraries, in which this state subsists for groups of all orders, is not and cannot be
an artificial state created by choice of the points of division between A and «, Band £,
and so on, but must arise from some real and natural symmetry in the distribution of
frequency.
