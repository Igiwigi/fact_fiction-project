The central neryous
system of the Mollusca is essentially composed of the three orders of ganglia which I have just pointed out
(orders answering exactly to those mentioned in the text), and it is in fact reduced to these ganglia in a
certain number of animals of this type. But in others the nerves which are given off present numerous enlarge-
ments in their course, and this tendency to a ganglionic disposition is $0 decided among the highest Mollusks,
that all the nerves emanating from the central medullary masses produce new ganglia in the parts to which
they are distributed” (p. 667). Again :—* From the facts which have just been stated summarily, T believe I may conclude, —

*1. That the exclusive analogy which many naturalists have wished to establish between the nervous system
of the Mollusca, and one of the portions of the same system in the animals of higher classes, is not only con-
trary to physiological principles, but als to anatomical facts. 2, That the nervous system of Mollusks corresponds, in fact, in its distribution to the same parts as those
which constitute it in the superior animals, the whole difference consisting in the degree of development and
dispozition of the parts which is in relation with the rank that Mollusks occupy in the series, and the plan
which nature has followed in their zoological type.
