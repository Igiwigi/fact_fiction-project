change and who were of higher socio-economic status were more likely to agree that their own
behaviour would be impacted by the prospect of geoengineering. As wealth and socio-economic
status are major predictors of an individual's carbon footprint [37], this raises the possibility that
people who consume more may be more inclined to view geoengineering as a reason to avoid
personal-level behavioural changes than people who consume less.


Conversely, people who scored more highly on self-transcendent values (e.g. concern for the | 2 |
welfare of others) were more likely to perceive other people and politicians to be susceptible to

the moral hazard trap (although not themselves). Climate sceptics were less concerned about 3

Climate change sceptics were also significantly less likely to agree with the galvanize statement : 3

audience. However, those scoring highly on the self-enhancing values scale were more likely to
agree that learning about geoengineering made the risks of climate change appear worse than
they had previously thought. The divergence between the endorsement of self-enhancement
