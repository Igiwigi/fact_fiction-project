        Nor doth its answer'd Challenge Rome decline;
        But whilst both Parties in full Consort join,
        While Heav'n and Earth in Rival Peals resound,
        The doubtful Cracks the Hearer's Sense confound;
        Whether the Claps of Thunderbolts they hear,
        Or else the Burst of Canon wounds their Ear;
        Whether Clouds raged by struggling Metals rent,
        Or struggling Clouds in Roman Metals pent.
        But O, my Muse, the whole Adventure tell,
        As ev'ry Accident in order fell.

        Tall Groves of Trees the Hadrian Tow'r surround,
        Fictitious Trees with Paper Garlands crown'd,
        These know no Spring, but when their Bodies sprout
        In Fire, and shoot their gilded Blossoms out;
        When blazing Leaves appear above their Head,
        And into branching Flames their Bodies spread.
        Whilst real Thunder splits the Firmament,
        And Heav'n's whole Roof in one vast Cleft is rent,
        The three-fork'd Tongue amidst the Rupture lolls,
        Then drops and on the Airy Turret falls.
        The Trees now kindle, and the Garland burns,
        And thousand Thunderbolts for one returns.
        Brigades of burning Archers upward fly,
        Bright Spears and shining Spear-men mount on high,
