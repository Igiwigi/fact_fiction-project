and infallibly distinguished from that of certain other red solutions of manganese, the colour of which
8ome chemists have been disposed to attribute to permanganie acid (see a paper by Mr. PEARSALL
© On red Solutions of Manganese,” Journal of the Royal Institution, New Series, No. IV. p. 49).

A If we suppose the angle of incidence ezactly equal to 45%, as8ume + for the refractive index of
Zthe fluid, and apply Fresxer's formula to calculate the ratio of the intensity of light reflected
at the exterior surface of a bubble, and polarized in a plane perpendicular to the plane of inci-
Sdence, to that of light similarly reflected and polarized in that plane, we find 0-228 to 1, a ratio
=pyhich certainly differs much from one of equality. But in order to render the two intensities equal,
St is 8ufficient to increase the angle of incidence by only 3* 35'; and in fact, as a matter of con-
Fenience, the position of the observer was usually such that the deviation of the light was somewhat
Za than 90?, and therefore the angle of incidence somewhat greater than 45®.

E I have since received a s8lab of glass of the kind here recommended, which has been executed for
Sme by Mr. Darker of Lambeth, and which answers its purpose admirably, the medium being emi-
Snently sensitive. Besides its general use as a screen, this slab, from its size and form, has enabled
Sme to trace further than T had hitherto done (Arts. 75, 76) the connexion between certain fluctua-
"tions of transparency which the medium exhibits and corresponding fluctuations of sensibility.
