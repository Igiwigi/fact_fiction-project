* The extreme length of life possessed by some insects’ sperms, which, in the case of Bees, are said to
survive for four or five years, is well known. (Cf. VON SIEBOLD, 1837.) LANG has lately shown (1904)
that sperms may live for three years in the vesicule seminales in Snails.—October 12.

5.—Some Theoretical Considerations.

In the present section we shall consider the bearing of some of the facts related
above upon the various theories which have been put forward regarding the nature
and cause of menstruation.

In 1865 Pruijasr advanced the theory that menstruation is brought about by a
nervous reflex, owing its origin to the pressure of the growing Graafian follicles upon
the nerve endings in the ovary. ‘This view has received some support from
STRASSMANN (1896), who claims to have induced “heat” in animals by injecting
gelatine into their ovaries and so causing intra-ovarian pressure. ELIZABETH
WINTERHALTER’S discovery (1896) of a sympathetic ganglion in the ovary also tends
to support this theory, but von Herrr (1896) discredits WINTERHALTER’s description,
which has not so far been confirmed.
