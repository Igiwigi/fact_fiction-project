well-preserved samples of Zag in a clean laboratory, discovering sufficient newly exposed halite
to permit analyses for indigenous amino acids [38].

(b) Chemical and isotopic analyses of water in meteoritic fluid inclusions

In a first attempt to make direct measurements of fluid compositions of preselected, individual
fluid inclusions, we initiated analyses at Virginia Tech by laser ablation inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (LA ICPMS) using an Agilent 7500ce quadrupole ICPMS and a
Lambda Physik GeoLas 193nm excimer laser ablation system. This system has been designed
and built expressly for the purpose of fluid inclusion analysis. Preliminary results seem to reveal
that the inclusion aqueous fluids contain highly charged cations of Ca, Mg and Fe, as predicted
(R. Bodnar and M. Zolensky, 2015, unpublished data). However, the measurements were barely
above background, and so these analyses are in fact still just barely beyond the current state of
the art. No doubt such analyses will be practicable in a few more years.

Large variations of hydrogen isotopic composition have been observed in hydrous minerals
from chondrites [39], and cometary and interstellar water is highly D-enriched [40,41],
representing cloud or outer solar disc chemistry. The hydrogen isotopic composition of hydrous
minerals in chondrites is believed to reflect inner Solar System water [39,42]. Oxygen isotopes
in the Solar System are also highly variable [43,44], reflecting contributions of at least one
HO component, probably O!%-poor [45-47]. However, it is impossible to measure isotopes of
hydrogen and oxygen simultaneously in hydrous minerals, because they invariably contain
structural oxygen not bound in water. Fortunately, halite contains no structural oxygen or
hydrogen, permitting measurement of both the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen
in aqueous fluid inclusions. Once again, halite is shown to be a special mineral.
