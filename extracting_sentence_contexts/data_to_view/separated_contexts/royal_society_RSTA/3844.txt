On the knife-edges of the spurs the new mass still lay, firm, coherent, forming an
excellent pathway, so smooth that one might have thought it had been prepared
expressly for the foot (see Plate 35). When the sun shone after heavy rain, the
smooth, narrow, winding strips of fine wet ash on these ridges reflected the light,
and they seemed like lines of silver traced on the dark-grey background of the hill. On
them the rain had little power of erosion, as they formed, in fact, the only tracts of level
ground on the whole mountain. The fine dust was washed away, and the coarser sand
exposed by the beat of the raindrops. They were, as a rule, from 2 to 5 feet wide ;
laterally, as the slope increased, little rivulets formed, at first so small that they had
almost no cutting power, and on each side of the smooth central line there was a strip
fluted with little furrows.
