invasion of foreign particles, and that appears to us to be a valuable step and a
necessary preliminary to a successful study of their functions,
endeavouring to indicate the lines along which the specialization of the sporadic
Bsoblast has advanced, probably in most animal groups, we may proceed with
haps greater sureness. The primitive mobile, ingestive, and glandular cell of
BPphnia has become in Astacus the specially glandular eosinophile cell, the specially
ngobile and ingestive hyaline cell, and the specially absorptive rose-reacting cell, and
What we know of the sporadic mesoblast of the Vertebrates points to its having
developed along similar lines.
But both older and later observations* on the part played by wandering cells in the
fZrmation of scar tissue, indicate that an even more extended conception of the
Wlations of the sporadic mesoblast may at some future time become necessary, and the
@nvenient fiction, wherein the blood was regarded as a tissue, like cartilage or
®nnective tissue, only with a fluid matrix, may yet be found to embody a morpho-

Beical truth.
