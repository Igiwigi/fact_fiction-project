A. FisHer, who invented the
‘Berm likelihood, and in a series of papers (FisHeR, 1925) stated several important
a roperties of the maximum likelihood estimates, to the general effect that it is
amprobable that their values will differ very much from those of the parameters
stimated. In fact, the maximum likelihood estimates appear to be what could be
Galled the best “ almost unbiassed ”’ estimates. Many of Fisuer’s statements, partly
n a modified form, were subsequently proved by Horetuine (1932), Doos (1934),
and Ducus (1936). An excellent account of the present state of the theory is given
by Darmors (1936). . : :
3 In certain cases the unbiassed estimates are identical with those of maximum
ikelihood ; in others we know only the maximum likelihood estimate, and then
Fac is no “ competition ” between the two principles.
