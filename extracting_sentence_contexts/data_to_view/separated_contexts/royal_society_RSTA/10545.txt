His values, reduced to a unit
at 20° C., are given for comparison in Table XIV. The agreement with our values is
remarkably close at the lower temperatures ; but the difference at 80° amounts to
nearly 1 per cent. In addition to the fact that his curve cannot easily be reconciled
with Rrenavtr, there is this theoretical difficulty in accepting his values at higher
temperatures. The quantity which he actually observed was the mean specific heat
between the higher temperature and the final temperature of his calorimeter. His
values of the specific heat itself were obtained by differentiating the curve, and really
depend on small differences at the higher points between observations which are
themselves difficult and uncertain.
