functions respectively, vanish identically (as is in fact obvious from the form of the
expressions), but these terms may of course be omitted ab initio. The following are the results which I have obtained ; it is well known that the last
or constant function is in each case equal to the discriminant, and as the expressions for
the discriminant of equations of the fourth and fifth degrees are given, Tables No. 12
and No. 26 in my © Second Memoir upon Quantics*,” I have thought it sufficient to refer
to these values without repeating them at length. Table for the degree 2.
