When the density f(m?) = Mm where M is any constant, we have /” (a?) = M/2m.
We then find (see Art. 33)

The integration can be effected by writing u = 1/v.

37. The expression for the potential of a homogeneous ellipsoid, when the law of
force is the inverse sixth power, having been found freed from all signs of inte-
gration, it follows by Jexierr’s theorem that the potential for any even power greater
than 6 can also be expressed in an integrated form (Art. 5). In fact, if V, be the
potential of the ellipsoid when the force varies as the inverse x" power, we have when
t=4(«—4)

Writing \ for & and remembering the expression for the perpendicular p’ on the
tangent plane to the confocal, this is easily seen to agree with Cayteys formule
quoted in Art. 31.
