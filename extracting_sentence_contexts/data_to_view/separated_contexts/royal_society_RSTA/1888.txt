Mendeleev concluded, ‘Today, 20 years after the above conclusions were formulated, they may still be
considered as expressing the essence of the now well-known periodic law’.


4. The contribution of Lothar Meyer

Among the characteristic properties dependent upon, and foretold from atomic weight, one finds,
remarkably, even the characteristic density of an element. The fact that even a chemical element's
density was subject to periodic variations with the increasing value of the atomic weights was first
brilliantly highlighted by Lothar Meyer. For such a graphic and enduring construction, we must
also remain indebted to Meyer who independently contributed a highly important development
to the periodic law of the chemical elements [12]. Thus, if the chemical elements are arranged along the axis of the abscissae, at distances from
zero and proportional to their atomic weights, each element thereby occupies a fixed point
along the axis.
