additive. The determinations made by St.sersvetn for mixtures of benzol and phenylethylacetate give
results for the Loren1z constant which aro always in excess of the theoretical value, by amounts ranging

up to 8 per cent. ; the discrepancies for his own constant K—1 are rather smaller, and are in both direc-
tions.


THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 237

of radiation across a medium permeated by molecules, each consisting of a system of
electrons in steady orbital motion, and each capable of free oscillations about the
steady state of motion with definite free periods analogous to those of the planetary
inequalities of the Solar System; and its analysis will in fact resemble Lapnacr’s
general investigation of the latter problem. If 6), 4,... represent small deviations
from the state of steady motion of a molecule, so that the coordinates of the system
are f; (t) + 1, fo (t) + 4,..., the kinetic and potential energy of the molecule when
expanded in powers of these small quantities will assume the forms

where the terms in T and W denote functions of the varicus degrees of these
velocities and displacements, the last term in T being a lineo-linear function of them
jointly. From these expressions the free vibrations are determined by the LAGRANGIAN
