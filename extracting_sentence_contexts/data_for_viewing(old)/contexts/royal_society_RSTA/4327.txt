a weighted L? norm which gives the following approximation:

where iIgl3, =>; a(ti)°Oi(ti), 9; is the derivative of 6) which is computed by a central difference
scheme, gi(ti) is the ith element of vector g.

Using the fact that supp(?) = (—sy, Sy), it is easy to check that the columns of the matrix @¢ are
orthonormal under the weighted discrete inner product

Using this property, it is easy to derive the following equality:
109 - Xlla0 = [Ixll2- (4.3)

We can also define the projection operator Py) to the V(@) space. Here, V(@) is the linear space
spanned by the columns of the matrix @g and Py) is the projection operator to V(@). Since the
columns of the matrix @g are orthonormal under the weighted inner product (4.2), the projection
Py) can be calculated as follows:
