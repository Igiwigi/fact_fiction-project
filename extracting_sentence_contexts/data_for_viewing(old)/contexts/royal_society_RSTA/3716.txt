AV/AVc. For rigid volume control this plot gives values of a minimum buckling volume change,
AV{, and a Maxwell volume change, AVy, both functions of R/t as displayed in figure 6. To our
knowledge, this paper for the first time presents accurate results for the Maxwell condition of
equal energies in the unbuckled and buckled states over the entire practical range of R/t for rigid
volume control. A neat extension covers the case of semi-rigid loading.

More important than the Maxwell points are the energy barriers [21] against finite static
or dynamic disturbances plotted against the controlled AV/AVc in figure 7 for R/t=100. We
compare the energy barriers for dead pressure and rigid volume control in figure 12 for the same
R/t. The difference between these ‘shock sensitivity’ barriers is an indication of how much safer
against disturbances is rigid volume control than dead pressure loading. For rigid volume control
there exists no possibility of creating a buckle at pressures lower than that of point N, above L in
figure 12b, and the curve for this case terminates at that pressure. The rather surprising fact that
there is so little difference between the barriers of the perfect shell for the two extreme loadings is
consistent with the fact that experiments on thin shells that have explored this issue have found
very little dependency on loading compliance [25,27].

Initial imperfections must of course be considered if we are to improve on our current
understanding of the scattered experimental results summarized recently by Wunderlich &
Albertin [28]. An important step in that direction is made by Lee et al. [6], who have measured
buckling pressures of elastomeric spherical shells of R/t=108 with carefully manufactured
dimple imperfections with amplitudes up to 2.5 times the shell thickness. For imperfection
