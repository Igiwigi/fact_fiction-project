rent from that quarter flows freely up the valley without any intervening object to
obstruct its progress; $0 that an extraordinary prevalence of south-westerly winds
might be expected to increase the amount of rain at Wastdale, and to diminish it in
the other valleys; and vice versd, with a long continuance of north-westerly winds.
Troutbeck, which is similarly sitnated to Wastdale, has only received about 5 inches,
or one-sixteenth less than the average quantity.

The wet days at Wastdale are generally about sixteen more than at Seathwaite,
the wettest of the stations ; but in 1849, they are forty-three in excess, and thirty-one
more than have been recorded in any other part of the Lake District.

This may be accounted for from the fact, that the mountains surrounding the Head
of Wastdale are both the highest and the nearest to the sea ; their elevated peaks at-
tract the clouds, and occasionally deprive them of the whole of their water ; and such
appears to be more particularly the case in dry seasons and periods. Hence Wast-
dale is visited with many showers which never reach the more inland valleys. The
increase in the annual depth of rain from this cause is, however, very trifling.

Gatesgarth, which usually obtains about one-fifth more rain than Wastdale, in 1849
has received nearly 10 inches less; and in the latter half of the exceedingly dry year
1844, I find that the excess was also in favour of Wastdale.

These abnormal results are evidently the effect of the position or bearing of the
respective valleys in regard to the prevalent wind. Wastdale may be said to receive
