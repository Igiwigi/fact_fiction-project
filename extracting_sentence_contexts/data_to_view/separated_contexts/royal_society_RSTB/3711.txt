Possibly the
conclusion which can be drawn with the greatest confidence is that the extraordinary
mimicry displayed in the female sex is at present of little importance to the
population of the butterfly in Ceylon. Finally, as regards the polymorphism of polytes considered from a more general
point of view, it is impossible to draw any definite conclusions. The fact that such
dissimilar insects as the three female forms can exist as members of one species
suggests that the important characters from the natural selection standpoint are not
so largely external as is sometimes supposed. The irregular fertility discovered in
the experiments was not investigated sufficiently for its exact nature to be discovered,
but it suggests a method by which polymorphic species could be divided into
“monomorphic” species, provided the factors for fertility and sterility were coupled
with those controlling the external form. If, therefore, forms of equal selective value
are not uncommon in nature, as might be deduced from the occurrence of P. polytes
and other polymorphic species, then the whole question of fertility and sterility is of
the greatest importance in the formation of species, and may be worthy of close study
in other species.
