From both the literature review and the GIMMS analysis, it is
clear that both forest loss and gain are occurring widely through-
out Africa. In terms of area, it appears that the area of land
undergoing woody encroachment may be comparable or even
larger than areas where a significant loss of forest cover is occur-
ring; subsetting the GIMMS analysis most of the increase is in
the woodland and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa north of
the equator, whereas in the Miombo woodland regions, south
of the equator, forest loss appears to be dominating. However,
this conclusion has high uncertainties owing to potential arte-
facts in the GIMMS dataset, and regional variation in the
relationship between NDVI and woody cover. The results pre-
sented here are not directly comparable with analyses based
on detailed interpretation of small subsets [16,18], as those
interpretations assess changes in vegetation classes, whereas
the GIMMS approach sees changes in woody cover aggregated
across all vegetation types at an 8 km pixel size. While in places
the GIMMS approach and Bodart et al. [16] agree, for example
finding increases outweighing decreases in the far west of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Central African
Republic and Ethiopia, and rapid forest lost in the Miombo
woodlands of southern DRC, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique, in many areas, the GIMMS approach sees more
forest gains than Bodart et al. [16].
