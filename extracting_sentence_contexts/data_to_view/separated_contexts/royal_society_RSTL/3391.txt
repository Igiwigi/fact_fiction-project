MARTIN BARRY'S RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY. 561

explanation of them,—The newer researches of SCHWANN appear to give to observation
another direction, which will perhaps be more productive. It is thus possible, that
the germinal vesicle is the parent cell for new cells of the germinal membrane. The
new granulations into which, for instance in Amphibia and Fishes, I saw the ger-
minal spot to become divided, are perbaps young cells in the parent cell.” The
facts recorded in the present memoir show this conjecture, s0 far as it went, to have
been very near the truthf}.

418. Ricyarp Owe, with reference to the germinal vesicle of Birds, justly remarks,
*it is the essential element, of the cicatricula, and the centre from which all snbse-
quent development radiates.”

419. Aruen Trosox. © The vesicle of PurkINag***has*##received the name of ger-
minal vesicle, a most appropriate term, since it may be regarded as the more imime-
diate seat of the germ or germinating faculty of the egg||.” © We do not know with
certainty what befalls the vesicle of PurkINaz in the ovulum of Mammalia at the time
of its escape from the ovarium.
