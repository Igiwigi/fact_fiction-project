Its numerosity
is, however, an abstract, amodal property of a set, as Giaquinto
[3] explains. Although Benson-Amram et al. [15] rely on audi-
tory playback experiments of mammals in the wild, it seems
likely that when lions and hyenas make numerical assessments
of their own group and a competing group, they will use not
only auditory information about the unseen competitors but
also visual and other modalities to assess the number of their
own group, and hence make a cross-modal comparison of
numerosities. In fact, laboratory experiments show that mon-
keys and human infants can make cross-modal numerical
comparisons between vision and audition (e.g. [29,30]). It not
yet clear whether this is true in other species. Burr et al. [31] have proposed that, in humans, numerosity
is a primary visual property of a scene in the same way that
colour, contrast, size and speed are, and that the brain deploys
three visual mechanisms for making numerical discrimination
depending on the number of visual elements: for numerosities
approximately less than or equal to 4 (subitizing), 4—9 (serial
enumeration) and large numbers where the elements are too
crowded to parse.
