and the difference will be greater in proportion as the trabecule in the latter type
happen to be big and strong—in other words in proportion as their axes are at
greater distances from one another, for each trabecular axis shows a certain
uncalcified part in section, while the fibrous part cf the trabecula is disposed more
or less radially around the axis. The trabecular axis instead of being lens-shaped
in transverse section, is really only a point or group of points in well-preserved
specimens, and the term “centre of calcification” was originally given to describe
exactly such a trabecular axis seen in transverse section.

In the first part of this paper I have described in full the sections made through
several leading types of Astreidw and Fungide (cf pp. 127-189). It is therefore
unnecessary for me to repeat here the details of the microscopic structure charac-
teristic of these two large families of Madreporaria. The important fact is that
these younger families agree with the Paleozoic Cyathopbyllids in the essential
features of trabecular structure, and in the position of the apices of trabeculi at the
upper edge of the septum, Some of these younger types have precisely the same
distribution of trabecule in the septum as the older types. Others again have a
more elaborate system. Instead of having only one area of divergence in the
septum from which trabeculae fan out to the right and left and vertically upwards,
these elaborate forms have several such areas (cf. figs. 14, 15, 37, 38). These variations
are always associated with a specially large size of septum, or with rich toothing and
granulation of the septum. As I have already said, however, no degree of elaboration
alters the fundamental law that the free apices of the trabecule are at all periods of
growth directed towards the upper edge of the septum for that period.
