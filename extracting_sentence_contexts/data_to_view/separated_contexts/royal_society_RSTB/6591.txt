It is perhaps an expression of the fact that in these cases the unfolding
of the occipital operculum has not progressed as far as it does in more highly developed
brains. It is the difficulty of giving exact definition to the term “* Affenspalte”’
suitable for all cases. The difficulty is lessened by realizing that names cannot
imply all that is involved in the changes which are taking place in this region, or,
in fact, in any region of the brain. (See Kooy, 1921, fig. 22.)
