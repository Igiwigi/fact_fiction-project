as on the previous day.

32nd day.—Tested sensibility with the faradic current; the animal undoubtedly felt better on the
non-paralyzed side.

35th day.—Tested the animal with Dr. Suerrtncton; he came to the conclusion that the animal did
not feel so well on the paralyzed side. The animal can now move the right leg well and hops about all
over the cage, climbing the rope and running after the other animals. There is, however, very little
movement in the left leg; occasionally I noticed a bilateral associated flexion of the hip and knee
joints.

43rd day.—Tested the sensibility at a meeting of the Physiological Society. Pricking and the hot
water test demonstrated the fact that the animal felt much better on the non-paralyzed side. Mr.

Horsey recommended me to try Scurrr’s clamp test, which I have since found invaluable.
44th day.—A small pair of clip forceps was fixed on the skin of the foot, leg, and back, its attention
being attracted by my assistant to pieces of apple, so that the animal did not see what was being done.
It immediately removed the forceps on the non-paralyzed side. Now, as it did not see the forceps, it
could only have become conscious of their presence by the skin sensations produced. When the same
forceps were applied on the paralyzed side in similar situations, the animal took no notice, but went on
uninterruptedly grabbing at pieces of apple and raisins. The forceps were again applied to the right
foot; the animal immediately ceased its efforts to obtain the fruit, and directed its attention to the cause
of irritation, drawing up the right leg and pulling the forceps off with the right hand. On the paralyzed
side the forceps were left on ten minutes without the animal taking any notice. I then removed them,
