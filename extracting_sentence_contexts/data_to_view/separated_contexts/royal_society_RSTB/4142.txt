Further, in all the parasitic Binucleata leading up to the trypanosomes,
which have been more studied than any other flagellates of recent years, and in
which a special look out has been kept for the occurrence of syngamy, no one has
ever found any process which can for a moment be regarded as indicating conjugation. As Mr. Lapace and myself have pointed out, we consider that conjugation is now
entirely lacking in all these forms. This view receives additional support from
the fact that I have not found it (nor has anyone else) in Bodo,

If we can feel assured that the binucleate flagellates do not undergo syngamy—
a negative is, strictly speaking, impossible of proof—and when we see that other
(quite probably all) more or less closely related forms among these lowly proto-
mastigine flagellates, which possess no kinetonucleus, do undergo syngamy, we have

an important pair of facts, which may well be correlated. I suggest, therefore,
that there is a close connection between these two developments, namely, the
presence of the binucleate condition and the absence of syngamy.
