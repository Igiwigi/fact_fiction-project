must be zero; and hence, since « (4, a) is zero, the function « (s,@%) is zero at each
point of (a, b) (§ 11).

Now when s > a we have

x (8, ch) = 8(a) $(s),

and, at points of ¥, ¢(s) does not vanish; we must therefore have 0(™) = 0. It can

be proved in a similar manner that ¢(s) vanishes everywhere in the interval (8, b).
Finally, we can show that, at points of the open interval («, 8) which do not belong

to &, both 0(s) and $(s) vanish. In fact, if a, is any one of these points, there are

clearly points of % both on its right and on its left. The argument we have just
employed will then establish that, by reason of the former, (a) is zero, and that,
by reason of the latter, # (a) is zero.

§16. Conversely, let us suppose that « (s, ¢) is defined in terms of continuous
functions 6(s), ¢(s) which have the properties mentioned in the preceding paragraph ;
and let us consider the function
