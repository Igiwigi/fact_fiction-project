According to LEHMANN (1926, p. 367), in
the embryo of Carausius morosus Br. the spiracular rudiments are formed on the
lateral sides of the anterior end of the segment. The different positions gained by
spiracles are due to their migration and to the important fact that in adult insects
there is a secondary segmentation (vide SNopcRass, 1927, p. 7), and not only the
primitive anterior intersegmental membrane but also a posterior part of the pre-
ceding segment called the precosta has become fused with the anterior margin of the
following segment. As a result of this, the spiracles have come to lie in the anterior
region of the segment and have thus lost their primitive intersegmental position. The location of the spiracles on the anterior margin of the pleural region of their
segment is a well-known fact (vide WEBER, 1933, p. 429).
