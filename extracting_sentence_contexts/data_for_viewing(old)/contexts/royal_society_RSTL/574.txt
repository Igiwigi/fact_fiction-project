point, exhibiting effects of natural operations, by which bitumen
and coal have been imperfectly and partially formed, without
the absolute obliteration of the original vegetable characters ;
and, although I have selected the Bovey coal as an example,
because it is found in this country, we must recollect that
Similar substances, or strata of bituminous wood, are found in
many parts of our globe; so that the example which has been
more immediately chosen, is neither rare nor partial.*

The nature, however, of the various kinds of bituminous wood,
may in some respects be difterent ; but this I have not as yet
had the means of ascertaining ; I shall therefore only state the
facts resulting'from experiments made on Bovey coal, and more
especially on a peculiar bituminous substance with which it is
accompanied. But, before I enter into these particulars, it will
be proper to mention a very remarkable schistus, with which
I was, some months since, favoured by the Right Hon. Sir
Jostepny BANKS.

* Strata of bituminous wood are found in various parts of France, in the vicinity of
Cologne, in Hesse, Bohemia, Saxony, Italy, and especially in Iceland, where it is
known under the name of Surturbrand,
