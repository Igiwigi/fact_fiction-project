large and well-connected social networks facilitate cumulative cultural evol-
ution because they promote the spread of useful cultural traits and prevent
the loss of cultural knowledge through factors such as drift. This view stems
from models that focus on the transmission of cultural information, without
One contribution of 16 to a theme issue considering how new cultural traits actually arise. In this paper, we review
the literature from various fields that suggest that, under some circumstances,
increased connectedness can decrease cultural diversity and reduce innovation
rates. Incorporating this idea into an agent-based model, we explore the effect
of population fragmentation on cumulative culture and show that, for a given
Subject Areas: population size, there exists an intermediate level of population fragmentation
evolution that maximizes the rate of cumulative cultural evolution. This result is

explained by the fact that fully connected, non-fragmented populations are

able to maintain complex cultural traits but produce insufficient variation
