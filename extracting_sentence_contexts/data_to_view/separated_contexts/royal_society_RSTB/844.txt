94 MR. W. B. HARDY ON SOME FEATURES AND PROPERTIES OF

of Vertebrate nerve fibres, either in preparations treated with osmic acid, or in
those stained by WercErtâ€™s method. In tracing the anterior nerves into the ganglion a curious point is noticed, namely,
that the transverse sectional area of the whole nerve on each side is much reduced,
thus forming a narrow neck just before the nerve plunges into the ganglion. If the
fresh nerve is examined under the microscope, or if individual fibres are carefully
followed in a series of sections through this part, the sudden increase in the bulk of
the nerve which takes place a fraction of a millimetre from the ganglion, is found, as
has already been shown by Haxcxet,* to be due to the fact that the large fibres
there divide into large and medium-sized fibres (fig. 12). In the example figured it
will be seen that while the smaller branch is conspicuously smaller than the nerve
fibre before the branching, the large branch is of much the same size. Both branches of each anterior nerve contain fibres of each of the two classes, as
will be seen on reference to fig.
