In general, plant behaviour is based on growth and devel-
opmental responses to the environment [5,19,37,101,102]. It is
an attractive feature of plants that, owing to the move-and-
stay nature of responses (instead of move-or-stay), not only
the actual behaviour, but also a part of the past behaviour
can be seen. Colleen K. Kelly expressed this by writing
about the plant’s past foraging decisions ‘etched’ into the pre-
sent form [109]. I would add that mostly the successful trials
can be seen. For example, a tree’s present branching structure
reflects its past decisions about branching, but most of the
unsuccessful branches have disappeared by now. The com-
plexity of plant behaviour originates from the fact that
many events can happen simultaneously.

7. Perspectives in the network view

What do we gain by viewing the plant as a network of
agents? I think this is not just a metaphor, but has practical
consequences. The rich methodology of network theory
could facilitate the study of plants for the following reasons.

(1) The individuals (genets) may consist of so many modules
that it is difficult to overview the whole system’s
structure.
