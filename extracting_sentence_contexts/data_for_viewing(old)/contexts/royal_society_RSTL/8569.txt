In a letter addressed to the President of the Board of Trade in 1863+, Dr. Ropixsox,
of Armagh, thus summarizes our knowledge of fog-signals:—* Nearly all that is known
about fog-signals is to be found in the Report on Lights and Beacons ; and of it much is
little better than conjecture. Its substance is as follows :—

< Light is scarcely available for this purpose. Blue lights are used in the Hooghly ;
but it is not stated at what distance they are visible in fog: their glare may be seen
further than their flame}. It might, however, be desirable to ascertain how far the
electric light or its flash can be traced.

* Sound is the only known means really effective; but about it testimonies are con-
flicting, and there is scarcely one fact relating to its use as a signal which can be consi-
dered as established. Even the most important of all, the distance at which it ceases
to be heard, is undecided.

« Up to the present time all signal-sounds haye been made in air, though this medium
has grave disadyantages: its own currents interfere with the sound-waves, s0 that a gun
or bell which is heard several miles down the wind is inaudible more than a few furlongs
up it. A till greater evil is that it is least effective when most needed; for fog is
a powerful damper of sound.”

Dr. RopixsoNn here expresses the universally prevalent opinion, and he then assigns
the theoretic cause. Fog, he says, © is a mixture of air and globules of water, and at each
of the innumerable surfaces where these two touch, a portion of the vibration is reflected
