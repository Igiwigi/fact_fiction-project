He
_fsumes the existence of a mother polyp which grows vertically upwards, giving off
Bteral buds or stolons, which subdivide repeatedly and give rise to coenenchymal
*Beca, amongst which calicles are here and there formed by the suppression of a limited
mber of tubes. The explanation is ingenious, but it is controverted by the fact
‘Phat there is not, in any colony, any trace of such a central apical polyp, and a study
e the colony, especially of its central layer and of its growing edge, shows most
Ponvincingly that the ccenenchymal cxca are the active agents of growth and
pansion, and that the polyps are only secondarily formed amongst and out of these.
is is shown to be the case by a study of fig. 4; the growth at the edge of the
Zolony is effected by the endodermic outgrowths (MoseLry’s superficial layer of canals)
Which penetrate into the newly formed mesoglea beneath the ectoderm, and thence
“grow outwards as new coenenchyme ceca, (Compare p. 459.) An examination of the
oes at the growing edge, such as is represented in fig. 5, shows that new tubes
riginate as small triangular cavities, usually in the spaces where the walls common
Ao three contiguous chambers unite together, and that they end blindly below. They
are, in fact, intercalations between, and are not (with few exceptions), branches of
Pre-existing tubes. Although in the absence of any positive evidence, such as would be afforded by a
Series of growing colonies from their first formation onwards, any attempt to explain
the growth and formation of Heliopora must be open to correction, I believe that
the following account: is justified by a study of the architecture and mode of increase
the colony. In a flattened explanate frond there may be seen in vertical section
central core, composed, as I have already shown, of numerous polygonal tubes, having

thin walls and a generally vertical ascending course.
