ments. The two values differ by about i
24 per cent. ; if we take the mean we find 2 8 4 Seu A ai. 38 19 20
b= 316 x 10% This gives, for the dis- Ye? rae
continuity of potential at the surface, the
value 2°63 volts, and would therefore give 1°47 volt as the difference of its values for

sodium and platinum.

The above value of the difference, which is approximately equal to the contact
electromotive force for sodium and platinum, forms a strong confirmation of the
theory; but when we come to calculate n, the number of free corpuscles in a cubic
centimetre of sodium, the agreement is not so good. In fact, we find from the
experimental results that for 0 = 628, log,, C — $log,) 9 = 2615; whence, putting
in an estimated value of the area of the sodium surface, we get n = 10" about. The
value of n has not been determined for sodium by any other method, but we should
expect it to be not greatly different from that for copper, which is given by
Mr. Parrerson as 3 X 10”, The value given by this method is thus far too great,
for it is hard to imagine that the corpuscles can have a pressure of ten million
atmospheres. I believe the discrepancy here is greater than can be explained by
errors of experiment, although that was possible in the case of the high values found

for carbon.
