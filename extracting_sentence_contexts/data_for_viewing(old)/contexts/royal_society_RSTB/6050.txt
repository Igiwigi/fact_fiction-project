As concerns the later embryonic and foetal stages of the Pithecoids, SELENKA, in
his interesting paper “ Die Gleichartigkeit der Embryonalformen bei Primaten” (’01)
calls attention to the striking conformity in the configuration of the embryonic body

in the forms studied by him and states that in the further course of development, the
embryos of the Catarrhine monkeys, the anthropoid apes and man resemble each other
“ganz erstaunlich.” Kerpen (04, ’06) also, after a detailed study of SELENKa’s
material remarks on the great similarity which is noticeable between the young embryos
of different species of monkeys and between these and the corresponding embryos of
man, but he lays stress on the fact that differences (exclusive of the development of the
tail) very early manifest themselves as well in the development of the single species
of Catarrhines as between the embryos of the latter and those of man.

BiuntscHut (13, p. 199) in his preliminary account of his material makes some very
interesting remarks on Platyrrhine embryos. He states that comparison of the ontogeny
of the Platyrrhines with that of man yields in regard to general features quite funda-
mental similarities (Analogien), but that in detail, differences already exist in quite early
stages, even before the limb-primordia appear, for example, the Cebus embryo of this
stage is characterised by its wide mouth-bay and its enormous heart. So also in Hapale
(as I have myself observed in the 6 mm. embryo) and in Chrysothrix, the extremely
voluminous heart remains for long an outstanding characteristic, and with this feature
is associated the relative smallness of the head in proportion to the trunk as in all
