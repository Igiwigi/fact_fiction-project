f'(x(t)) — lis uniformly bounded away from zero. In figure 4a, the parameters are chosen such that
f'(x(£)) < 1 along the solution. If this condition is not met for some values of x, the corresponding
period-1 solution is unstable, and the numerically computed solution appears irregular for those
values; see figure 4b and compare proposition 6.1(iii). This qualitatively resembles delay-induced
switched states with incoherent part in (1.1) and (1.2), although the solution is more erratic than
for positive ¢; compare figure 1. We attribute this to the ‘smoothing’ effect of the term ex’ in (1.1)
and (1.2), which is not present in (6.1) and (6.2).

The solutions shown in figure 4 correspond to well-chosen initial conditions satisfying the
integral property in proposition 6.1(ii). For strictly positive (or analogously strictly negative)
initial conditions, the solution to (6.1) and (6.2) does not resemble a delay-induced switched state.
As a result, for such initial conditions, we do not expect delay-induced states in (1.1) and (1.2).
The next section discusses this fact in more detail.

7. Coexistence with fold-induced slow—fast oscillations

Section 3 revealed that, for a given function f and carefully chosen initial conditions close to the
balance point, (1.1) and (1.2) displays delay-induced switched states. Here, we show that this
