the interior of each of the larger objects in the germinal vesicle Plate XXIIL fig. 169. c,
presented an appearance fully warranting the section fig. 177 ; though it was not pos-
sible to represent this appearance in that small figure. The seetion fig. 177. is, in
fact, a delineation of one of the objects in the snbstance surrounding the germinal
vesicle in an ovarian ovum of 8} hours. And in no object of the kind sufficiently
adyanced, and the interior of which the eye could reach, have I failed to find traces
of a structure essentially the same (se Plate XXV. figs. 200. 201.).

383, Only a first and second order of discs or incipient cells have been exhibited
in that section (Plate XXIII. fig. 177.), because I wish to figure nothing more than
has been actually seen. But my experience of these objects is such as to warrant the
belief that more orders might have been introduced. Indeed it is not possible to say
where the process ends, except in liquefaction.

384. In following out this process we have thus seen the nucleus, and especially its
centre, to be the seat of changes which were not to have been expected from the ex-
