Since towards the non-CpG context. Thus, it is likely that Dnmt3a s
5-hmC appears to be methylcytosine in bisulfite sequencing, generates non-CpG methylation, but it is still completely a
it is important to remember that one-sixth of ‘methylated unknown why neurons and ESCs have such a high amount = 2-
cytosines’ in the WGBS in previous studies of the mammalian of non-CpG methylation compared with other tissues. The 3
brain is in fact 5-hmC rather than 5-mC. Promoters with CpG function of non-CpG methylation is suggested to be repressive. Ss
islands are devoid of 5-hmC as well as 5-mC.
