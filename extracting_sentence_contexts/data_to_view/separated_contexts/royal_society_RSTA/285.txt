Quantitative analysis of his
results is difficult owing to the complexity of the phenomena involved, but evidence was
obtained indicating that collision detachment begins when the mean energy of the ions
passing through the gas is between 0-14 and 0-68 eV, the latter being the more probable
value. Apart from experimental uncertainties this does not necessarily mean that the
vertical detachment energy? of O5 lies between 0-07 and 0:34eV (allowing for the fact that
only half the total translational energy will be available to effect detachment in a collision
between O, and O;). The energy distribution of the ions will make the effect apparent at
a mean energy less than that just sufficient for the reaction to proceed. Further, both O
and O- will be present and reactions such as

O-+0,+O,+e, O+0;>0,-+4¢,

with onset energies of about 1-1 and —0-1 eV respectively (electron affinity of O, 2:2eV or
O,, LeV —dissociation energy, 1-1 eV§, of O,), must be taken into account.
