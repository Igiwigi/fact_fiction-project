§ 12. Discussion of Results.

The mean of the above values is 1°4841 volt at 15°C. The variation from the
mean is small. ‘The smaller result in Experiment 2 may be due to the unsteadiness
of the current during the experiment. It will be remembered it rose in value
suddenly by about one part in 300 during the observations. The result in Experi-
ment 9 is too high. This is, no doubt, due to the fact that the temperature of the
bottle cell was varying somewhat. The temperature of the bath changed between the
morning and afternoon observations on August 14 by 0°5 C. Now, our observations
have shown us that the E.M.F. of the cell lags behind the temperature when this is
changing. This lag is due to the time taken in changing the state of concentration
of the zinc sulphate solution. It is practically certain that on the afternoon of
August 14 the cell had not reached the steady state corresponding to 18°°3, and that,
therefore, the correction to 15° of ‘0036 volt is too high.

It will be remembered that some uncertainty of one or two units is attached to the
value of V in Experiment 5, August 10.

The weighings of the second bowl, No. 2, in Experiments 1, 2, 3, 4 have not bea
