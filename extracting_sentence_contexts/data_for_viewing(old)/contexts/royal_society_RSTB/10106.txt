pline connecting phenotype, its function and, importantly,
its biological role, is important for a better understanding
of the evolution of biodiversity in near and deep time. As
functional biology establishes linkages between diversity,
form, function, performance, fitness and major niche dimen-
sions [62,63], it aids the identification of key determinants of
organismal survival. In a general sense, a focus on the analy-
sis of functional traits allows the assessment of structural,
physiological, biochemical and behavioural capabilities of
an organism to interact with its abiotic and biotic environment
and thus predict how they may respond to changes [64]. The
need to put function at the core of biodiversity research
stems from the fact that it is functional diversity, not species,
phylogenetic or morphological diversity, that determines
important ecosystem processes [65,66]. It is therefore particu-
larly important to understand how biotic and abiotic factors
regulate functional diversity because it has conservation impli-
cations, including but not limited to: ecosystem stability [67],
invasion tolerance [68] and ecosystem services [69].

When preparing macroevolutionary analyses, it is impor-
tant to quantify traits with well-understood functional and
ecological implications. Functional traits include ecological,
morphological and physiological measurements, for example
