including high-consequence decisions in government and industry. Here, we discuss two basic
requirements that such uncertainty reports should meet, which we refer to as faithfulness and
completeness. Clearly, there can be other desiderata for uncertainty reports as well, but faithfulness
and completeness seem to be among the fundamental desiderata; in ordinary circumstances,
when these requirements are not at least approximately met, an uncertainty report is inadequate.

According to the faithfulness requirement, an uncertainty report should accurately describe
what the agent believes the extent of current uncertainty to be; it should not imply that uncertainty
is greater than, less than or otherwise different from what the agent actually believes it to be.> For
example, if an agent concludes that available information indicates that X is more likely than not,
then a report that ‘X is unlikely’ would not meet the faithfulness requirement, nor would a report
that ‘X is possible (but nothing more can be concluded)’. The faithfulness requirement follows
from the simple fact that, in ordinary circumstances, a request for an uncertainty report just is a
request to know the agent's informed judgement about the extent of current uncertainty.

According to the completeness requirement, an uncertainty report should take account of
all significant sources of uncertainty, and should consider all available (relevant) information
when doing so. For example, suppose a scientist is tasked with estimating the uncertainty
associated with model-projected changes in temperature in a region, and he recognizes that this
uncertainty depends on three underlying sources of uncertainty, each of which is expected to
make a significant contribution to the total uncertainty: initial condition uncertainty, parameter
uncertainty and structural uncertainty.° If his analysis only takes into account initial condition
uncertainty (e.g. perhaps he does an ensemble experiment using different initial conditions), then
the analysis—and the uncertainty report it delivers—will be incomplete. Like the faithfulness
requirement, the completeness requirement seems to follow from the very nature of the request
