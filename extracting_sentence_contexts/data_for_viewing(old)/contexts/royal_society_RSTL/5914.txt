affirms is never more than 4 feet deep (ome chasms we presume excepted), were melted
in one instant, which no current of lava could accomplish, it would not have supplied
such a volume of water. He came therefore to the somewhat startling conclusion, that
the water was vyomited forth by the crater itself, and was driven out from some reservoir
in the interior of Etna*,

It seems to me very unlikely that the Canon, who was on the ground within three
months of the date of the catastrophe, should have been mistaken in regard to the region
of the mountain whence the waters came. His conclusions on that head seem to have
been legitimately deduced from the fact, that the wreck of the inundation was traceable

Sontinuously from the sea-shore at Riposto up to the highest cone or its neighbourhood.
T am therefore inclined to suspect that at the time of the eruption of 1755 there was
Apon the summit of Kina not only the winter's snow of that year, but many older layers
Sf ice, alternating with volcanic sand and lava, at the foot or in the flanks of the cone,
hich were suddenly melted by the permeation through them of hot yapours, and the
Zpjection into them of melted matter. TI stated in the first edition of my * Principles of
aeology,‚Äù that during my visit to Etna in 1828, I ascertained the existence of a glacier
-ginder lava near the Casa Inglese, on the S.E. side, near the base of the cone, and that
At had been quarried during the previous summer, affording a supply of ice to the Cata-
ASiians. On returning thirty years afterwards (September 1858), I found the same ice, a
ass of unknown extent and thickness, still unmelted. It had been quarried only five
