Whether the heat was occasioned by the electricity, or ap-
plied to it from some other source, the effect was the same. Thus a wire of platinum, of such length and diameter as to
discharge a combination without being considerably heated ;
when the flame of a spirit lamp was applied to it 0 as to make
a part of it red hot, lost its power of discharging the whole
electricity of the battery, as was shown by the disengagement
of abundance of gas in the secondary circuit ; which disen-
gagement ceased as 500n as the source of heat was with-
drawn. There are several modes of exhibiting this fact, so as to
produce effects which, till they are witnessed, must almost
appear impossible, Thus, let a fine wire of platinum of four
or five inches in length be placed in a voltaic circuit, so that
the electricity passing through it may heat the whole of it to

redness, and let the flame of a spirit lamp be applied to any
part of it, 80 as to heat that part to whiteness, the rest of the
wire will instantly become cooled below the point of visible
ignition. For the converse of the experiment, let a piece of
ice or a stream of cold air be applied to a part of the wire ; the
other parts will immediately become much hotter ; and from
a red, will rise to a white heat. The quantity of electricity that
can pass through that part of the wire submitted to the chan-
ges of temperature, is s0 much smaller when it is hot than
when it is cold, that the absolute temperature of the whole
wire is diminished by heating a part of it, and, vice versa,
increased by cooling a part of it.
