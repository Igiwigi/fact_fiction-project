and even into a certain part of the altered germinal spot. We have seen this part
tending towards the surface of the oyvum. I have now to add, that in that region of the
thick transparent membrane f, towards which this part was tending, I have in many
instances observed an attenuation or an orifice, This has been noticed not only as
early as the fourth hour (fig. 165.), but in very mature ova-F, even ante coitum. The
form of the orifice in question is sometimes such as to suggest the idea of the mem-
brane having become cleft; in some instances appearing to have been first attenuated
also.

333. Should this observation be confirmed, I think we $shall be in possession of
very strong presumptive evidence that the central part of the altered germinal spot is
the point of Å¿eeundation. In further proof that such really is the case, another fact
will be hereafter given (par, 346.).

334. On one occasion, in an oyum of 54% hours (fig. 167.), I saw in the orifice of the
membrane F, an object yery much resembling a Spermatozoon which had increased in
8ize, Its large extremity was directed towards the interior of the ovum. Fig. 168.
represents a portion of this object ; the remainder having been too indistinctly seen
to admit of delineation. The part figured seemed discoid in its form, and appeared
to contain a pellucid and nearly central cavity}.

335. Around the orifice in the membrane f (Plate XXIII. fig. 173.), the tunica gra-
nulosa presents the effects of the determinate pressure by which the oyum had been
held in contact with the wall of the ovarian cavity.
