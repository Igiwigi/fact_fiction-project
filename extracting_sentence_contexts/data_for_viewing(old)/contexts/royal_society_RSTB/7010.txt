was of triangular outline; and in yet others where a rectangular system was used, the stele
was of rectangular outline. The shape of the stele, in fact, is directly related to the cross-
sectional outline of the isolated terminal region. Higher up, where there is a return to
the approximately cylindrical shape of the normal shoot, the stele is approximately circular
in transverse section (figures 78, 81, plate 10). Figure 11 shows a transverse section of
a shoot which had been dissected by six radial longitudinal incisions, the apical meristem
being left intact. Here again it will be seen that the outlines of stele and shoot are in close

agreement.

The rectangular or triangular outline of the stele in the lower region of an isolated
terminal region is to be related, in the first instance, to the initial incisions, and secondly,
to the fact that when the severed, incipient vascular tissue begins to grow, its outermost

cells undergo a parenchymatous development. In other words potential vascular tissue
becomes transformed into cortical parenchyma; the latter, at an early stage, can be seen
to extend as radial rows originating from thin-walled vascular elements (figure 111, plate 14).
At this level the new cortical parenchyma is of inconsiderable radial extent. So, too, at
higher levels in an isolated terminal region, the ratio radius stele : radius shoot is greater than
in the normal shoot. A comparison of the data relating to the relative development of
pith, stele and cortex in experimental and normal plants may throw light on the distribu-
tion of nutrients in the growing region (Wardlaw 19452).
