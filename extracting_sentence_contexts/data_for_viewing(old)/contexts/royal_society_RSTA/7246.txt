The values selected as the ‘best’ are 31-1 and 27-0 kcal. respectively. These figures are
probably within 0-2 kcal. of the true values. In the case of zinc, the value selected receives
excellent support from that calculated from the depression and elevation of crystal levels
(Saté 1937).

(d) Mercury

The vapour pressure of mercury is the most accurately known for any metal, and has
been reviewed by Ditchburn & Gilmour (1941). The five points they quote for the range
246 to 354° K provide the value 14-75 kcal./g.-atom for the heat of vaporization of mercury
at 25°C. A new method employed by Thomas & Olmer (1942) furnishes the closely
confirmatory figure 14:92 at 10°C. Mercury vapour contains a small proportion of
diatomic molecules. Allowing for this fact, the heat of vaporization into free atoms at 25° C
is calculated at the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, to be 14-66 kcal./g.-atom.*

(e) Boron

Reliable vapour-pressure data for elementary boron are almost entirely lacking. This
element melts in the range 2000 to 2075° C (Ceuilleron 1944, 1945), and most published
estimates place the boiling-point in the range 2200 to 2550° C, From the spectroscopic
energy levels of the vapour and the heat capacity of crystalline boron, extrapolated to an
estimated sublimation temperature of 2700° K, the heat of sublimation into free atoms in
the ground state is calculated at the National Bureau of Standards to be 94 kcal./g.-atom
at 0° K,* which corresponds to 95 keal./g.-atom at 25°
