merations formed by the reunion of some of those that primarily issne from the pores of
the shell. The analogy of other Foraminifera, moreover, renders it very probable that
the prolongations of the sarcode-body which reach the surface through the canal-system,
will reunite upon it 80 as to form a continuous investment oyer the whole ; and that
this will be especially the case on the spines, appears to be indicated by the provision
there is in the furrowing of the surface, for conveying the prolongations of the sarcode-
body to every portion of their exterior.

206. Thus, then, by interpreting the structural phenomena presented by Calcaring
according to the analogy of the facts which have been determined by observation of the
living animals of the allied type Rotalia, we seem almost indubitably led to the con-
clusion that the canal-system is specially destined for the formation and maintenance of
the © supplemental skeleton ;” serving to convey prolongations of the sarcode-body from
the segments which occupy the chambers, through the thick layer of solid shell-substance
that is secondarily formed around those chambers, and through the prolongations of
that layer which constitute the spines; and further, that it maintains a tolerably direct
communication between even the innermost chambers of the spire and the external
surface,—a connexion which would have been cut off by the interposition of the
< supplemental skeleton,” had not this been provided with some such system of inter-
vening canals.

207. One more fact remains to be noticed, which is of much interest as showing that
