what are the differential invariants up to the second order that involve more than
a single function ¢. And as the last part of the merely analytical portion of the
memoir, I propose to state the results for differential invariants up to the third order
but to give practically none of the contributory analysis. Some idea of the protracted

DIFFERENTIAL INVARIANTS OF SPACE. 283

character of the calculations needed for the construction of the differential invariants
of the third order may be gathered from the fact, that they require the complete
solution of a Jacobian system of fifty-seven simultaneous partial differential equations
of the first order and the first degree.

For such analysis as will here be given in detail, we need the following particular
cases of the preceding general results :-~
