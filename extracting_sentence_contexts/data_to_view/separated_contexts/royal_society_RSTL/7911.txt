Assume for a moment that, for a given value of s, «, is positive; but for the
term 7, it would of course follow that there was for the degree in question a certain

number of irreducible covariants; and it was in this manner that I was led to infer that

the number of the covariants of a quintic was infinite—viz. the transformed expression
for the number of asyzygetic covariants is

=coeff. & in (1=&)"(1=0)* (1=@)"* (1=@)t...,
a product which does not terminate, and as to which it is also assumed that the series
of negative indices does nof, terminate.

332. The principle is the same, but the discussion as to the number of the irreducible
covariants becomes more precise, if we attend to the covariants as involying not only the
coefficients (a, b, .. .) but also the variables (z, y); we have then to consider the covari-
ants of the form (a, Þ, . . .Y'(a, y)*, or, say, of the form aa* (degree 0 and order f), and the
number of the asyzygetic covariants of this form is given as the coefficient of aa" in
a given function of (a, a), (I write « instead of the 2 of my Second Memoir in the
formule which contain & and 2): by taking account of the composite covariants and
syzygies, we successively determine, from the given number of asyzygetic covariants for
each value of 0 and p, the number of the irreducible coyariants for the same yalues of
/ and pp. Thisis, in fact, done for the quintic in my Eighth Memoir up to the coyariants
and syzygies of the degree 6. But before resuming the discussion for the quintic, I
will consider the preceding cases of the quadric, the cubic, and the quartic. Article Nos. 333 to 336.—New formul for the number of Asyzygetic Covariants.
