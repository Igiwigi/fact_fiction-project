In the
posterior caudal region (fig. 197) the only constrictions on the dorsal surface are inter-
vertebral, there being a distinct dilatation in each centrum ; ventrally, however, there
are vertebral ingrowths as well. My Father (38) considers “ these beadings as a true historical record of develop-
ment,” and as indicating a far greater number of vertebre in the ancestors of Birds
than in existing forms. I think, however, that a good deal of weight should be
attached to the fact that the number of segments in Apteryx undergoes no alteration
from a period corresponding to the fourth day of incubation in the Chick. The last free and normal vertebra is the 45th (Cd. 11); the body of the 46th
(Cd. 12) is fused ventrad of the notochord with that of the 47th (Cd. 13), bat is free
above the notochord. The body of the 47th is a long hollow cone of cartilage, pro-
jecting some distance caudad of its arch, so that the posterior end of the neural canal
is freely open above.
