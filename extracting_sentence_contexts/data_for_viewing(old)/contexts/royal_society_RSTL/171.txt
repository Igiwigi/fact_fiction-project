feet, granting the whole of this to be an error on the side of the
survey : but, as the general surface of the moor at Bridgewater
Bay is several feet above the surface of the sea, we may take a
moiety of. 24, feet, for the error of the computed height of the
Station at Lugshorn Corner.

ART. XLv1. Matters relating to Refraction.

The refractions contained in this account, like those in our
former Papers, tend to prove, that when rays of light pass hori-
- zontally, and considerably distant from the surface of the earth,
they are less bent or refracted from their rectilinear courses,
than theory and opinion have laid down as fact. It is very cer-
tain, however, that objection lies against particular conclusions
drawn from such data as we' possess ; because the angles of
elevation and depression of corresponding stations are observed
at different times, and almost always, therefore, under different
circumstances ; but, with the-experience and continual practice
of thus obtaining means of computing these refractions, although
we may not be able to determine the refracting power. of the
air under given circumstances, yet,. as the causes which render
