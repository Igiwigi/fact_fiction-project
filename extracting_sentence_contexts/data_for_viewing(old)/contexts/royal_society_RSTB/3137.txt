but he seemed very uncertain about it. With daylight he thought it “merely
a difference in intensity,” being, I fancy, misled by the dark lines near G, but with
the are-light he said the colour was different. The bright lines of calcium (H and K)
were visible to him.

His eyes were easily tired with the light, so that I was not able to continue the
examination long enough to get at the complete explanation of his nomenclature of
certain colours.

His blue-green junction was quite normal as to the effect on it of physiological
fatigue, and as to position, it indicated a strong green sensation. His spectrum was
shortened at the red end, but not so much as in the case of the totally red-blind—
it reached, in fact, farther than I could trace my own green sensation during artificial
red-blindness.

For this reason I think he must possess some traces of a red sensation, and also
because of the curious uncertainty he manifested concerning this part of the spectrum.

Our green he ordinarily called “ yellow.” What looked red to me was always either
“ green” or “a colour I cannot name” to him; but the same colour was sometimes called
by one name and sometimes by the other after a few minutes’ interval, if he did not know
it to be the same. Red objects did not strike him as bright coloured, but rather
