Cf. § 48 infra. The other main division of the energy is the kinetic part, which is specified in
terms of the rate of change of configuration of the material system with respect to
an extraneous spacial framework to which its position is referred. Whatever notions
may commend themselves @ priori as to the impossibility of absolute space and
absolute time, the fact remains that it has not been found possible to construct a
system of dynamics which has respect only to the relative positions of moving
bodies; and the reason suggests itself, that there is an underlying part of the
phenomena, which does not usually explicitly appear in abstract material dynamics,
namely, the ethereal medium, and that the spacial framework in absolute rest,
which was introduced by Newron and was probably a main source of the great
advance in abstract dynamics originated by the Principia, is in fact the quiescent
underlying ether. In this way the purely @ priori standpoint is pushed away a
stage, and we may find justification against the reproach that a philosophical
formulation of dynamics should be concerned only with relative motions. Relation to Gas-Theory : Internal Molecular Energy.
