For example, models of water-flooding treatments that take
place over months or years must account for large-scale three-dimensional diffusion. Kovalyshen
[52] exploited the decoupling of the pure elastic deformation due to the mechanical loading of the
crack from pore pressure diffusion to investigate the evolution of radially symmetric fluid-driven
fractures that involve fully developed three-dimensional diffusion. In this paper, to develop the
asymptotic analysis required to locate the free boundary, we exploit the fact that the tip region of
a finite HF can be represented by a semi-infinite fracture, which was shown [52] only to be true for
a permeable medium if L >> VcT. However, when three-dimensional diffusion is fully developed
around an HF, a new approach will need to be developed to analyse the tip region. Proppant transport.
