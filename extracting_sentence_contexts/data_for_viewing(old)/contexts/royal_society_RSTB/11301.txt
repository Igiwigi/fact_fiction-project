Figure 3. Each English local dialect is represented by a circle in its geographical location. The features analysed in each panel are presented in the upper right. The
colour of each circle indicates the number of these features that are shared with Sranan, corresponding to the colour scale on each panel. The form present in Sranan
is indicated in brackets. The types of features considered are: (a) presence of post-vocalic rhoticity, (b) absence of post-vocalic rhoticity, (c) presence of a diphthong
and (d) presence of word-initial phonemic [h].
