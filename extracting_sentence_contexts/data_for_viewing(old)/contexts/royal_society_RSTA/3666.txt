Figure 3. Plot of the intensities of mass spectral peaks due to H,0, CO, and CO showing how these varied with time after the
arrival of Philae at the surface of 67P. The first data point in each case is from the experiments conducted at Agilkia; the remainder
are from the long-term monitoring campaign at Abydos. Best-fit lines though data collected between 881 and 1248 min (four
consecutive points in each case) are shown as the dotted lines. Note that the species labelled as CO, and CO are not corrected for
the effects of cracking of C0, * (m/z 44) to CO* (m/z 28). This has not been done herein because the exact details of corrections
like this are not yet certain and will require further work. However, it is a fact that without correction the values recorded for CO
are upper limits. Error bars are 1 s.d. (i.e. the noise associated with ion counting).

low H2O/CO} ratio is a consequence of low activity—this will be resolved as Rosetta continues
to follow the comet through Perihelion and beyond. As noted previously [34] there is a low
CO/CO; ratio at Abydos; in fact, since the data are not corrected for the effects of cracking of
CO», this means that the values are upper limits since the measured CO? signal is not entirely
from ionized CO (i.e. some is from CO* that is cracked from CO2+ within the mass spectrometer).
Corrections are not applied for this because the magnitude of the effects are uncertain and require
further laboratory calibrations (see electronic supplementary material, notes). Notwithstanding
this issue, looked at another way, the Abydos landing area of 67P seems to be relatively depleted
in H2O and CO.
