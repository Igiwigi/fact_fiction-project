The issues highlighted here seem to point to the idea of the need to ‘co-create’ data
together with stakeholders, to generate a shared understanding of risk and encourage greater
participation, and buy-in from the general public in order to facilitate constructive debate on the
options for dealing with climate risk locally. In this context, a risk assessment has some ‘pulling
power’, bringing together different stakeholders with varying views on risk and how to manage
it. This may, in fact, turn out to be the biggest advantage of climate risk assessment: it offers an
opportunity to create a shared understanding of the problem and enables an informed evaluation
and discussion of remedial action. Far from being an objective study, a risk assessment can house
a variety of subjective perspectives and serve as a salient focal point for the entire normative
decision-making process. Put differently, a risk assessment should leverage the ‘pulling power’
of data which brings together experts, stakeholders and normative decision-makers to achieve
optimal adaptation to flood risk levels in Cork [20].

The example of Cork illustrates the complexities of translating risk assessment into local action.
The city appears to fulfil all the usual conditions for supporting urban adaptation action:
there is significant awareness of the problem and a broad acknowledgement of climate change;
