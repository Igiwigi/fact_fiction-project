The tabular logarithms of a series of ordinates corresponding to equal
time-intervals, are in arithmetical progression. This method was used in verifying
the hypothesis as to the time-relations of the normal excursion. The second is a
graphic method depending on the fact that the subtangent NT (fig. 1) of a logarith-
mic curve, or intercept, upon the asymptote between the tangent and ordinate to any
point upon the curve, is of constant length. This property affords a means of finding
the position of the asymptote when only a portion of the excursion has been included
in the photograph. Two points are chosen some distance apart, and the tangent and
ordinate drawn to each.
