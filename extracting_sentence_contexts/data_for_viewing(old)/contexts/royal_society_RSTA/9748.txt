reduced to a vanishing point by the simple expedient of enclosing the whole beam
with a small additional inner case. With these facts before us, it was concluded that
the difficulties arising from the presence of air streams might be successfully met by
completely enclosing the pans and stirrups by means of shells having a very high
conductivity for heat. Theoretically, the following very distinct advantages are
gained by the use of such shells, more particularly if the exterior surfaces are polished
and the interior coated with carbon :—

(1) The effective volume of the disturbed air is very greatly reduced ;

(2) A shell having a high conductivity for heat may, when placed within a balance
case, be regarded as possessing throughout a strictly uniform temperature ;
in consequence of this, combined with the fact that the inner or carbon skin
has the power of rapidly absorbing and radiating heat energy, the contained
air will also acquire the same uniform temperature ;

(3) Radiant energy falling upon the outer polished surface of the shell will be
almost entirely reflected; the insignificant fraction that may enter will be
incapable of producing any appreciable disturbing effects in the air enclosed

by the shell.

All these advantages were effectually secured in the following way :—

Four half cylinders of stout sheet copper were prepared, the diameters of two
