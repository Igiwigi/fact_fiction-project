646 MR. CLERK MAXWELL ON A DIRECT COMPARISON

If we take into account the fact that the section of each coil is of sensible area, this
formula would require correction ; but in these coils the depth was made equal to the
breadth of the section, whence it follows, by the differential equation of the potential of
two coils, given at p. 508 of my paper on the Electromagnetic Field,

that the correction is a factor of the form (1 —Yz A) where &' is the depth of the coil
—a correction which is in this case about 1—-000926.

The s8uspended coil, besides the repulsion due to the fixed coil, experiences a couple
