Introduction.

Tax following paper treats of the effects of frictional tides in a planet on the orbit of
its satellite. Tt is the sequel to three previous papers on a similar subject.*

The investigation has proved to be one of unexpected complexity, and this must be
my apology for the great length of the present paper. This was in part due to the
fact that it was found impossible to consider adequately the changes in the orbit of the
satellite, without a reconsideration of the parallel changes in the planet. Thus $016
of the ground covered in the previous paper on « Precession ” had to be retraversed;
but as the methods here employed are quite different from those used before, t
repetition has nob been without some advantage.
