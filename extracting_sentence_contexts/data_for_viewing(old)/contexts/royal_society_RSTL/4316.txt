interpretation does not necessarily exist, if we conceive the cotidal lines to be mere
geometrical diagrams, not lines marking the progress of a wave by motions of the
particles perpendicular to the line of the wave. With this extension of the notion of
a cotidal line, snch lines may still be used to represent, in the first instance, the
results of tide observations made at a series of places in the same seas; nor does it
appear that there can be at present devised any better method of bringing tide ob-
servations into geographical combination, than this method of drawing cotidal lines.
The case of the tides of the German ocean, for instance, where the order of the tide-
hours had led me to draw the cotidal lines as converging to a centre of no-tide (as
in Article 15), has been differently explained by Mr. Airy. He conceives that
these tides arise from the combination of a tide running along the eastern coast of
England to the south, with a tide coming through the Straits of Dover to the east.
But the combination of these two tides would, in fact, produce such cotidal lines as
I have drawn, with a point of no-tide where I had predicted it, and where it was
found by Capt. Hewsrr. It is true, that on this supposition the point of no-tide
would not be a point of rest of the ocean ; nor did I ever suppose that it would be 80.
There is, at the point of no-rise-and-fall of the surface, a considerable stream of tide
alternately north-east and south-west, as Capt. Hewerr found. And the same will
