The carapace also acquires two antero-lateral spines and two more
at the base of the rostrum. A+ this time it is much like Zucifer, as 8hown in column 4
of Table VI., but the endopodites of the third pair of maxillipeds and of the pereiopods
are rudimentary, and shorter than the very long-jointed exopodites. The significance of the various stages in the metamorphosis of the higher Crustacea
is one of the most interesting questions in the whole field of morphological science,
and it has given rise to at leasb its due share of speculation, but it will not be out of
place to examine the relation between the facts which have been described and the
various theoretical views which have been expressed upon the snbject. In the case
of the Sergestide it is obvious, in the first place, that the adult Dncifer and Acetes
also, if Acetes be an advlt, are little more than mature representations of the Masti-
gopus stage, complicated in the case of Tnctifer by the formation of a neck, and in the
case of Acetes by the presence of gills, and chelz on the pereiopods. There can also
be little doubt that the Schizopod stage of development in the Sergestide and Pen@us
bears a similar relation to the adult Schizopods, especially to Amphion, the adult
character of which seems to be established by WiLLEMGEs-SUnM's observations (Proc.
