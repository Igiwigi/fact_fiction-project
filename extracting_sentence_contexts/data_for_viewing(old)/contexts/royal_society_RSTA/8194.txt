flat forms, their apparent wave-length being prolonged (as compared with the corre-
sponding pulses in a perfectly elastic solid). Srzawa also analysed the problem of the
propagation of waves in a beam fixed at one end. Though he does not give the
derivation of his equation of motion, it is clear that he has made some approximation
such as Vorer made, or else assumed that 2//% = p’/p as is implied by QuimBy’s
analysis of a similar problem.

Now, any molar (or large scale) theory of the properties of a strained and straining
solid can be nothing else but the “‘ thermodynamics of a continuous medium.” It must
be emphasized that the stress-strain relations are not the basis but the result of such
a theory. A stress-strain hypothesis, as it stands, can tell us very little about the
properties of the solid it claims to represent, and it is not necessarily consistent with
the first and second laws of thermodynamics or with the fact that the solid is to be
regarded as continuous. For instance, certain symmetry relations must hold between
the elastic coefficients (or constants) occurring in the expression of Hooxe’s law; and
we shall see in § 1-6 that equivalent symmetry relations must hold between the viscous
coefficients in Vorer’s visco-elastic stress-strain relations. Further, the mere state-
ment of a stress-strain hypothesis gives no suggestion as to the limits in which it is
valid, whereas a thermodynamical theory can sometimes supply information concerning
the character of the limits.

The value of experimental evidence in the development of a thermodynamical theory
of a continuous medium applicable to a strained and straining solid is twofold. In the
first place the character of the experimental evidence suggests the functional form for
the expression for the energy of the solid, and also for the rate of dissipation of energy
