Now when the asymptote to the magnetic curve passes through O, we have seen
that there is a tangent to it at R. But in the same case, M OP” is itself a tangent to
the same branch at a point infinitely distant. As the magnetic curves approach to-
wards O, there will still be two tangents possible, the point of contact of one becoming
continually nearer to O in the angle P'"M Y, and the other in the angle RM P", till,
as before shown, they coalesce continuously in O. The branch lying in the angle
P'MY, therefore, has M O P" for a rectilinear asymptote, as the branch in the oppo-
sIte region had M P.

It would probably be difficult to establish, from any considerations furnished by
the properties of the magnetic curves, the utmost angular extent to which the infinite
branch lying in the angle O MQ extended from the asymptote M O P”. But recur-
ring to the fact furnished by equation (82.), that for every value of 8 which gives one
real value of » there is also a second real value; and as for all values of 0 comprised
between &«, and &,, or within the angular region 'T O U, we have shown that there is
one real value of 7; and, with the exception of the angular region M O W, (WO W'
being the tangent to the magnetic curve at O,) we have established two values ; it
follows, that for completing the whole series, and fulfilling the conditions of (82.),
there must be a second value of 7 for every direction which a line can take in the
angle P'OW'; or, which is the same thing, the infinite branch will touch the line
OW", but can never pass to the right of it ; that is, it lies wholly in the angle P'OW,
and never meets the line O W' again after it passes through O.

The course of each curve of verticity is thus fully made out : and it now appears
that each is confined within specific and peculiar angular regions referred to lines
