Similarly, U;, consists of only diagonal
unitary matrices, so U, =T”. Thus, in the regular case on a generic co-adjoint orbit, we have

dim F-1(A) = (2*) -n me) -n wn D_n, 6.3)
k=1

which is exactly half the dimension n(n — 1) of a generic co-adjoint orbit of U(n). This fact is not
surprising, because we know that connected regular fibres of integrable Hamiltonian systems
are Lagrangian tori whose dimension is equal to half the dimension of the symplectic manifold. In our regular generic case, S(E*) = U(n), is a torus of dimension n(n + 1)/2 on which a torus
U(n), =T" of dimension n acts freely, and the quotient space F~1(A) is a torus of dimension
n(n + 1)/2-—n=n(n—1)/2=N.

(c) Elliptic non-degenerate singular fibres

In the case when all the horizontal inequalities in the Gelfand—Cetlin triangle are strict, but there
are some diagonal equalities (of the types Aj, =Aj—1k-1 OF Aix =Aix—1), we still have G, = Tk
for each k and U,=T", but now some of the groups A, are non-trivial tori. For example, if
Aik =Ai-1,k-1, then it means that the corresponding eigenspaces of ox_1 and a, coincide: W;, =
Wj-1,k-1, which implies that A, contains U(W;,).
