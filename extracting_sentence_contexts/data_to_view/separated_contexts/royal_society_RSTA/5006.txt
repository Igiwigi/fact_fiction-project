the onset of the macroscopic localization, whereas the solid dot indicates the onset of void coalescence. (Online version in colour.

versus Eeq in figure 9a and the values of f/fo at first localization and at the onset of coalescence
as a function of T in figure 9b. The separation between first localization and coalescence for T >
is brought out clearly in the latter figure. Figure 9b also reveals that there is some uncertainty in
identifying the onset of coalescence owing to the fact that each simulation must be monitored
step by step to identify the point where the localization condition is met. For T <1, the onset
of localization and coalescence occurs when the void volume fraction reaches f = 0.03 in this
example, a relatively small value which, nevertheless, is 30 times the initial value. Thus, while
macroscopic localization and coalescence occur simultaneously when T < 1, extensive prior void
growth has occurred to set the stage for these events which is not predicted by a coalescence
model.
