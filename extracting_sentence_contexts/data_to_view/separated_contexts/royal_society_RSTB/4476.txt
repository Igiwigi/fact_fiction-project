The question is so wide, and has so often been handled by experts, that I cannot
pretend to deal with the entire evidence. I shall, however, venture to go into some
detail with regard to the evidence from the vascular anatomy, which, I may say
beforehand, appears to me to be conclusively in favour of the Brachyblast Theory. (a) Evidence from Vascular Anatomy.â€”The most striking fact that emerges from
a general survey of the literaturet is that, at its origin, the supply to the ovuliferous
seale is fundamentally similar to that to a vegetative axillary branch, while some-
times the resemblance is so close that a distinction appears impossible. The
similarity between the vascular supplies of the ovuliferous scale and vegetative
axillary bud was frequently urged by SrraspurGer in his classical work on the
Conifers and Gnetacew (1872, frequent statements scattered over pp. 25-75, in
connection with Biota, Juniperus, Araucaria, Agathis). More recently, Eames
(1913, p. 21) has laid emphasis on the same feature.
