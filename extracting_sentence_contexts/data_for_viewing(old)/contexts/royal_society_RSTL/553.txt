154 Sir E. Howe on the feet of animals

but concave surfaces, as KELLER represents them; a copy of
which representation is annexed.

Although the author states them to be concave surf:ces, he
Says that they are only used when the fly moves horizontally ;
but when it moves perpendicularly, or upon the ceiling, they
are turned up out of the way ; and the progressive motion is
carried on by fixing the/crotchets into: the irregularities of
the surface on which the fly treads, whether glass, porcelain,
or any other substance. It will, however, scarcely be doubted,
from the preceding facts, that these concave surfaces are em-
ployed to form vacua, which enable the fly to move under
such disadvantageous circumstances upon the same principle
as the Lacerta Gecko.
