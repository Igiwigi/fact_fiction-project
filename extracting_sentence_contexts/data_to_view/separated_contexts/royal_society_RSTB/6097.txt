Very few abortions were observed. During the same
experiments it was also noticed that submorsitans produces more puparia at a relative
humidity of 11% than at 44%. For purposes of comparison it is convenient to
standardize the birth-rate and reduce it to puparia per 100 female-days ; the facts
for the two species are shown in Tables V and VI. In these tables the production
of puparia is given in five-day periods, Â¢ signifying the mean number of females
alive during that period, the number of larve or puparia produced, and 4 the
number of births per 100 female-days. Table V deals with tachinoides.
