'The retention of reaction to stimulation in the first instance in this experiment may
have been due partly to reflex action, partly to the retention of sensation ; but that
sensation was impaired was evidenced by the fact that the animal ceaged to use its right
limbs as before for the purposes of prehension and touch. Here also, as in destruction
of the hippocampal fold, there was apparent muscular paralysis—but not s0 in reality,
as the animal could still move the limbs in some degree, and the muscles retained
their tonicity and Tesistance. The interference with vision may have been due to the proximity of the lesion to the
angular gyrus and its medullary connexions, as much as to the lesion of the optic tha-
lamus, and therefore no definite conclusion is built on this fact. With regard to the
circular moyements of the animal which were occasionally made, the body seemed to go
to the right or left according as the left arm was adducted or abducted. The next experiments relate to the effects resulting ſrom destruction or complete
removal of the occipital lobes.
