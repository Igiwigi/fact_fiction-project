Clips.— Placed on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the left side produced no effect upon the animal,
and although each limb was placed close to the right hand, no attempt was made by the animal to
remove the clips. When tranferred to similar points upon the right side they were immediately
removed. Knee-jerks exaggerated upon both sides.

4th day—Descent of the diaphragm on the left side produces a much stronger impulse against the
finger, in fact it is nearly as strong as the right. Sensation.—Pricking the root of the tail produced facial evidence of feeling on both sides, more
marked on the non-paralyzed side. No reaction elsewhere, although usually obtained in a healthy
Monkey.
