[18] showed that the nonsensical results obtained by applying superficially the asymptotically
flat space lensing formalism are due to the difference in the definition of the light bending
angles in the non-asymptotically flat space of equation (2.4). The result of this approach to the
asymptotically non-flat space of equation (2.4) for a light ray of impact parameter b with respect
to the coordinate origin is given by

with 8, y,k the parameters of the vacuum solution of equation (2.4). This expression contains the
effects of the de Sitter geometry discussed in [17] and the term 267 /b which includes the effects
of the yr term of the metric.

One should note that despite the fact that the y,k terms are associated with conformally flat
degrees of freedom and as such they should not contribute to light bending, nevertheless they do
so through their coupling to the non-conformally flat component f. It is also of interest to note that
the dependence of the yr term effect has the same b-dependence as the Newtonian 1/r term, in
distinction to that of the k term, arguing for a different character of these two terms and consistent
with the considerations given in §2(a) that one, y, is associated with an interior moment of the
source, while the other, k, with an exterior one.

We have outlined above the vestiges of a conformally invariant theory of gravity and its exact
