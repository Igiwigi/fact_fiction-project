5. Theoretical analysis

One of the deficiencies of fracture mechanics textbooks [23] is that peeling fracture is not normally
described, despite the fact that peeling gives the simplest crack equilibrium equation as first
discovered by Rivlin in 1944 [9], while also giving failure at the lowest force possible, making
it mechanically easy. Additionally, the peel crack propagates at constant speed under steady load,
so does not accelerate catastrophically as in the Griffith crack, giving easier observations of crack
speed. The same is true for the lap joint crack, showing its relation to peeling and bending cracks,
which are also absent from most fracture mechanics courses, possibly because solutions produced
by the Griffith Principle do not produce the Griffith equation for peeling, bending, double torsion,
compression, JKR, compact tension and almost every practical cracking test.

The starting point for the present analysis is 7 peeling shown in figure 6.

Peeling is most interesting if the elastic strip can bend but is sufficiently thick to give low
extension, such that the elastic energy is almost all in the bent part of the strip. This is the situation
