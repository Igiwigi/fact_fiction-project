(a) Imaging the autonomic nervous system

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) owes its name to John Newport Langley [1], a British
physiologist widely regarded as the father of autonomic neurophysiology. As later communicated
by Langley himself, ‘it was a local autonomy that [he] had in mind. The word “Autonomic” does
suggest a much greater degree of independence from the central nervous system that in fact exists’
[2]. Hence, since its discovery and despite its nomenclature, the ANS has never been considered
or treated as completely independent from the central nervous system (CNS). More than a century
after its discovery and initial description, there is still substantial debate about the nature as well
as functioning of the control pathways through which the CNS interacts with the ANS.
