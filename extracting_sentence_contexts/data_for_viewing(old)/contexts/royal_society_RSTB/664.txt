40 centims. (16 inches) in length, or weighs more than 11 grammes, i.¢., about, at the
most, one-twelfth the weight of the organ of a large R. batis. This being the case, it
may be inferred that the shock from the electrical apparatus of the majority of the
British species of Skate would be much weaker than the shock from a large 2. batis
or a R. alba, most probably so weak that it would be impossible to detect it without
the use of the electrometer or some other instrument. Hence, should it be afterwards
shown that the electric organ of a large R. batis is of use, it will not necessarily follow
that the much weaker batteries of the smaller species are also useful.

As already mentioned, I have recognized three distinct modifications of the cup-
shaped elements. These three variations are illustrated by the three British species
having electric cups, viz., R. radiata, R. circularis, and R. fullonica. One of the
most interesting facts about the cups in these three species is that they seem to

represent three important stages in the evolution of the disc-like electrical elements
out of muscular fibres—the cups in I. radiata being at the best only modified
muscular fibres, while the cups in 2. fullonica approach, in many respects, the discs of
R. batis. The structure and development of the organ of R. radiata I have previously
described.* Since writing the account of the organ of this species I have examined
