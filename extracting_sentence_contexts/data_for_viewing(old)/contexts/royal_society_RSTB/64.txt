susceptibility of the excised Mammalian heart to experimental interference. Our
laboratory notes contain abundant examples of this extreme susceptibility to
apparently trivial causes. To mention an example, we have frequently noticed that a
slight touch with a blunt pointed instrument near one of our two electrodes was
sufficient to develop permanent negativity at the part, indicative of a slight degree of
injury. It consequently happened, as the most frequent exception to the classical
effect, that instead of the diphasic variation, indicative of negativity at the first and
second contacts respectively, we obtained only a simple variation. We think that

the apparent local negativity developed under these conditions was in different cases
attributable to either of two causes: (1) injury; (2) the excitatory state. The first
cause is indicated by a single permanent deflection, the second by a single swing ; and
that this is an excitatory effect is indicated by the fact that the first variation
consequent on excitation is often followed by a second or a third such variation, and
that the series of single variations thus initiated may terminate with a typical
diphasic variation. We have exceptionally noticed that local excitation might give
rise to a single variation, indicating that the electrode furthest from the point of

and, although at first sight anomalous, can, we think, be reasonably explained. We
