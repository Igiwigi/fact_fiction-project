The physical characters of this drift are equally well marked. The detritus of
which it is composed, is always of local origin and angular. The component
fragments retain their sharp angles uninjured. It is without stratification, and
yet not without a certain order such as might result from successive masses of
débris sliding down slopes and shot into hollows. In many respects, such as its wide
distribution, and its want of stratification, it resembles a subaérial glacial detritus,
but its entire want of wear, the presence of and condition of the bones, and especially
the presence of delicate land shells, are incompatible with such an origin. The
absence of foreign transported materials or boulders, and of marine shells, is equally
incompatible with a submarine glacial origin.

Taking all these facts into consideration, the only agent which appears to me
capable to have produced such results, is that of an upheaval of a submerged land
following upon a wide-spread submergence. This upheaval by displacing the super-
incumbent body of water, would give rise, as shown in a paper by the late Mr. W.
Horxixs, of Cambridge,* to divergent effluent currents, which would sweep down
from the higher to the lower levels the débris of the submerged surface. Such would
have happened, if after a temporary submergence the land had again been upheaved,
and the former levels approximately restored. All the phenomena presented by this
Rubble-drift are explicable upon this hypothesis, and upon none other that I can see.
Of the submergence we can only infer that it was slow and gradual, but of the
upheaval we have evidence to show that it was by stages alternately slow and more
or less rapid. That evidence is best exhibited, not in districts where the rocks are of
an uniform character, as then, in the absence of any difference in the débris, the
