The energy spread of the reflected
ions is further broadened by the complex upstream field structure ahead of the shock, which
show oscillations. The latter oscillations, which could be due to fast electrons, cause modulations
in the ion spectrum. In fact, the thermal spread of about 4 MeV of the hydrogen beam produced
via shock acceleration minimizes the ignition energy. Hydrodynamic simulations have indeed
shown that the minimum energy for ignition is a function not only of the average energy of the
beam, but also of its temperature and it presents a minimum for thermal spreads of the order of
3-5 MeV [5,8]. From our simulations, we estimate that about 0.3% of the total hydrogen ions and
0.23% of the total carbon ions get reflected by the shock.
