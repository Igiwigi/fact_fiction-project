We ſee then from this Letter, and from the Ac-
count I have before given of my Viſit ro M. Pivari,
that I have not been able to verify at Yenice any of
thoſe Facts, in which my Curioſity was intereſted.
I might add alſo (and I ought, without Doubr, ſince
I have engaged to mention exadly cvery thing I have
been able to find out from my Enquiries upon this

who have been with M. Pzvarz, to be certified of
the Truth of his Experiment from ocular Demon-
ſtration, and whom I was able to interrogate, I found
but one who atteſted them, as having ſeen them :
This was a Phyſician, a Friend of M. P7zvaii, whom
I found at his Houſe, and who had, as he faid, al-
moſt always aſſiſted him in his Experiments.
