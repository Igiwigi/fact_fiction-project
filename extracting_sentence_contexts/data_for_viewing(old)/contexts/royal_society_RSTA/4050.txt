consistent with the SM fits, switched attention to the last remaining unknown particle in the SM,
the Higgs boson.

The Higgs boson is a scalar particle predicted by the mechanism for electroweak symmetry
breaking based on work in the early 1960s [24-29] which was later incorporated into the SM
[30-33]. This mechanism allows the W, Z and the fermions to acquire mass by coupling to a scalar
field with a non-zero vacuum expectation value; introducing mass in this way preserves the gauge
symmetries of the theory, and thus the property of renormalizability required to make the theory
predictive at higher orders and higher energies.

The precise measurements of the top and W masses at the Tevatron [34,35] increased the power
of the SM fits, and—again via loop corrections—led to constraints on the mass of the SM Higgs
boson, should it in fact exist. Meanwhile, direct searches at LEP2, the Tevatron and early Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) data excluded significant ranges of possible mass values.

(c) Discovery and vindication

The discovery of the Higgs boson [36,37], with a mass of 1.25 x 10!! eV [38] once more consistent
with the constraints from electroweak precision data, was a remarkable triumph not only for
the accelerator and the experiments, but for the theoretical ideas behind the SM. So far, all the
properties of the boson—charge, spin, parity and the production cross section x branching ratio
for those decay modes which have been measured—are in agreement with expectations of the SM.
The SM now has no ‘missing particles’. Without the experimental discovery of this qualitatively
unique object, the SM could have been just an effective theory valid only up to 10!” eV or so. With
the knowledge that the Higgs boson exists, the theory is capable of making predictions at energies
