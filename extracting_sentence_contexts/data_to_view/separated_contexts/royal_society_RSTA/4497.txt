Doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere is not hypothetical. [fg
Current concentrations of around 400 parts per million (ppm) are already up by 40% over pre- aoe
industrial levels of roughly 280 ppm. At the current rate of increase, pre-industrial levels will :s
double well before the end of the century. :

The title question is also not hypothetical. Some apparently new facts have led IPCC (2013)
to reconsider the full implications for long-term equilibrium warming and have led it to widen fo
the ‘likely’ range, once again, to 1.5-4.5°C. In addition, the IPCC removed its prior ‘best estimate’ :
of 3°C. a

Unambiguous conclusions are hard to reach in this arena where uncertainties are large. Bearing =
this caution in mind, our analysis strongly suggests that, other things equal, the IPCC’s recent {8
widening of the ‘likely’ range of temperature change by reducing its bottom value may well :
increase appropriately calibrated WTP to avoid such change in the future.
