Overview of cultivation-independent approaches used to reconstruct microbial genomes. Schematic chart displays steps involved in cultivation-independent
methods to characterize microbial dark matter. TNF, tetranucleotide frequency; ESOM, emergent self-organizing map; MDA, multiple-strand displacement amplification;
FACS, fluorescent activated cell-sorting. TNF and differential coverage is, for example, employed by of DNA from individual uncultured cells rather than from
CONCOCT [33] and GroopM [34]. Finally, another commonly communities obtained by metagenomics (reviewed in refer-
used tool is based on emergent self-organizing maps in which ences [37â€”39]).
