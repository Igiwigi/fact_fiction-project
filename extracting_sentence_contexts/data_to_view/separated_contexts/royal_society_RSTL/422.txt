Thus he observes, that if the spinal marrow be divided
near the occiput, and a certain part of it immediately destroyed,


on which the action of the heart depends, &c. 87

circulation ceases. If some time intervene between the divi-
sion and the destruction of precisely the same part, the cir-
culation is not interrupted. M. LE GaLLois' explanation of these facts cannot surely
be admitted, and indeed is inconsistent with his own positions. He found, that confining the circulation to a less extent, by
throwing ligatures round the large vessels at some distance
from the heart, enables this organ to support the circulation
under circumstances where it would otherwise have failed,
Writers on midwifery have, on the same principle, recom-
mended compressing the arteries of the limbs when the powers
of the heart are much weakened by hemorrhagy. From this
experiment; compared with others, M. LE GALLo1s infers, that
when the spinal marrow is destroyed by small portions, the
circulation, in the parts corresponding to these portions, being
impeded, the effect is similar to that produced by the ligatures.
