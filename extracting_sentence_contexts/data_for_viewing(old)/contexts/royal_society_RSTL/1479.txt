of objects capable of acting upon the mind, and particularly
by removing all straight lines and angles, and all unnecessary
varieties of lights and shades, the attention might be concen-
trated and fixed in such a manner as 'to render the sense of
Sight peculiarly acute in distinguishing any difference in the
simple objects presented to the eye. But however plausible
this reasoning may appear, I own the experiment did not an-
swer my expectation. It is true, the apparent densities of two
equal hemispheres of shade, in contact with each other, may
be compared with great facility, and when no discernible dif-
ference is to be perceived between them, it is more than pro-
bable that they are in fact very nearly equal; but still I have
found by experience, that two equal parallelograms of shade in
contact with each other may be compared with the same ease,
and, I have reason to think, with equal certainty, and that
even when these unite! shadows are bounded on three sides by
a perfectly white surface, illuminated by the direct rays of two
strong lights ; that is to say, when the screen with the qua-
drangular opening or field is made use of.

In describing the cylinders by which the shadows are pro-
jected, I said they were fixed in the bottom of the box; but as
the diameters of the shadows of the cylinders vary in some
small degree, in proportion as the lights are broader or nar-
