These two techniques are based on the two : =
muon interactions with matter, ie. energy loss and multiple scattering, respectively. The muon 8
absorption imaging technique can be used to image very large objects such as volcanoes [1], but it [3
can also be used to image relatively smaller objects such as nuclear spent fuel casks [2]. The muon iS
multiple scattering imaging technique can only be used to image relatively small objects, such as :8
shipping containers [3] and nuclear waste containers [4], due to the fact that both the incoming : s
and outgoing muon tracks need to be measured. 8

Muon imaging requires solving an inverse problem [5]. This is because the characteristic
properties of the imaging object cannot be measured directly using the muon imaging system. However, they can be inferred from the effects of the muon interaction with matter, which can be
measured directly.
