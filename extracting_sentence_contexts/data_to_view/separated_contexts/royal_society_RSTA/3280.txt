However, given the sequence similarities and that they are both likely to be associated
into complexes that exhibit the same rosette structures, an entirely different organization
seems unlikely. CESA1 association into a trimer [32] may easily be reconciled with a CSC containing 18
CESA proteins in which the lobes of the CSC are composed of homotrimers of three different
CESA proteins (figure 3a). As the authors point out, however, the homotrimers generated may
be a consequence of the fact that only one CESA subunit is being used and may not reflect the
situation in vivo where three different CESA isoforms that may form heterotrimers are being co-
expressed (figure 3a). The same criticism also applies to the study on OsCESA8Cat, which appears
to associate to form a dimer [35]. This would suggest that there is sufficient uncertainty and
contradictory data that, by itself, this work does not provide an unambiguous answer regarding
CESA organization.
