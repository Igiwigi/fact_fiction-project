However, the attempts to realize the microwave technique for characterizing plasmas in
high-pressure gases meet great difficulties, first of all because of the necessity to determine the
electron-neutral collision frequencies ven. The microwave beam electric field attenuation coefficient a whose determination underlies
the method of measuring ne in strongly collisional plasmas is coupled with the beam and plasma

Given the a values measured with the scheme shown in figures 1 and 2, knowledge of the

experiments on investigating combustible gas mixtures, this poses great difficulties resulting
from the fact that the chemical reactions (including branching chain reactions) continuously

solved by bringing the second microwave beam into the diagnostics system and measuring the
microwave radiation electric field attenuation coefficients at frequencies of w; (wavelength 41)
