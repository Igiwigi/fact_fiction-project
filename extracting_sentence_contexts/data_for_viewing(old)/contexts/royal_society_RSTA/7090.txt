functions change very rapidly without having a singularity.

So far, only particular cases of the general co-operative problem in lattices have
been completely solved: those in which ys is capable of two values only, and the lattice
is two-dimensional. The partition function is completely known only in the case of
a rectangular lattice with equal or different interactions in the two crystallographic
directions (Onsager 1944; Onsager & Kaufmann 1946). In this case a single singularity is
known to exist and its position is also known. Under the assumption that a single transition
temperature exists for any symmetrical (equal interaction in all directions) two-
dimensional lattice, its value is known (Wannier 1945), again with the limitation that y is
two-valued.

For our purpose, only the potential energy U is required. There are, in fact, several
approximate methods for finding U, the best known of which is that due to Bethe (1935).
These methods have been applied extensively (Wannier 1945) to the Ising model of a two-
dimensional ferromagnet. However, the rigorous solution for a rectangular lattice, due to
Onsager (1944, 1946), is qualitatively different from all the approximate solutions. In the
approximate methods both the potential energy and the specific heat can be discontinuous
functions of temperature; the correct treatment shows that both are continuous, but the
specific heat has a logarithmic infinity at a temperature some 10% below that at which
Betheâ€™s method predicted a discontinuity. The reasons for this discrepancy have been
discussed by Wannier (1945). These results have thrown considerable doubt on the
predictions of approximate methods, especially when they predict a latent heat, i.e. that the
potential energy is also discontinuous. Broadly speaking, it is characteristic of these approxi-
mations that the calculated quantities are evaluated more accurately on the low-temperature
