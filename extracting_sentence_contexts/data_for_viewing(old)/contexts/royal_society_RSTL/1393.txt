stead of cd, when no such a quantity as m7 appears in the
investigation. If, however, we grant that the expelling force
must act without any diminution until the fluid comes to m n,
it seems that from the principles here assumed we ought to
substitute m n instead of cd, as otherwise we get the velocity
generated by the action of only a part of the force. The con-
clusion here deduced agrees very well with experiment ; but
an application of the same principles to another case differs 50

widely from matter of fact, as to render it very doubtful
how far the principles here applied can be admitted. And if
we were to grant the application of the principles here as-
sumed, $0 far as regards the determination of the velocity, yet
the time of emptying a vessel can by no means be deduced
from it.

In order to determine the time of emptying a vessel, we
must know both the area of the orifice c d, and the velocity at
that orifice. Now the theory gives only the velocity at mn;
and as it gives not the ratio of 9.7 to c d, the velocity at the
orifice cannot be deduced from thence, and therefore we can-
not find the time of emptying. No theory whatever has at-
