square of the angle, and is altogether beyond the region of experimental certainty.
When, however, the balls or counterweight are placed in position, if the construction
is not truly symmetrical, the beam mirror will now rotate about an axis which does
not pass through its centre of gravity. In an experiment made for the purpose, this
displacement, when the larger balls were suspended, was found to be ‘0063 inch, an
amount considerably larger than I had expected. In this case the moment of
inertia, added to the whole combination on this account, is, weight of beam
X 0063? = ‘844 X *0063° = 0000335 inch’ gram. The corresponding increase, when
the counterweight was added, was *844 x 0012? = :0000012 inch? gram, Applying
these small differences to the observations of Experiment 12, if I nay so far antici-
pate, the torsional rigidity of the suspending fibre is changed from *0012577 to
‘001257736, so that if this had been overlooked, the error introduced would have
been 1 in 35,000. It was not, as a matter of fact, observed until after the conclusion
of Experiment 12, and then I placed one of the microscopes so as to see the edge of
the lower hook of the beam, and measured the unexpectedly large deviations in the
: plane of the mirror; those perpendicular to the plane I had always known to be

practically inappreciable by the very small change in the position of the observing
telescope needed to again see the scale reflected centrally. This insensible correction
which tends to make G Seem greater, can only be applied to Experiments 10, 11, and
12, as the fibre met with an accident after Experiment 9, and was re-fastened to the

beam. As it cannot be applied to the others, and is far smaller than the uncertainty
of the experiment, it is not taken account of in the table,
