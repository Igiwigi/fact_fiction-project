This pumping process is repeated till the pressure in A is rather in excess of
what is required. The gas which remains in B is driven out through T;, which is then closed, and T,
opened for a moment, so that the narrow-bore tube and stop-cock are filled with
water. It is necessary, of course, for this purpose that R, should be raised high
enough to overcome the pressure in A; it is, in fact, now kept permanently fixed at
such a level throughout all subsequent operations. The excess of water always remaining above the piston in A at this stage is now
allowed to escape by applying sufficient pressure below to drive the piston up a little. The pressure is applied by pumping air into C, by means of the mercury compressing
pump shown at the extreme left of the diagram, The plug G is then pushed up and
the piston thus allowed to fly back into the constriction.
