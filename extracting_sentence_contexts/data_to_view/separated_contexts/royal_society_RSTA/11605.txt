The appearance of certain portions of the alloy with aluminium approaches
that of the alloys with lithium and selenium, but the bulk is rather crystalline. III. The interior paste, whether it be in grains or crystallites, is certainly crystalline,
as might have been anticipated from the fact that the colour of the grains varies with
the incidence of the light. When examined, after etching, under an enlargement of
000 diameters, this paste presents three aspects :â€”

8 (a) Clear vermicular structures on a dark ground. E (0) Parallel grooves.
8 (c) Pointed crystals of the same orientation, in lines nearly parallel.

= The photographs 21, 9, and 10 show these different aspects, which, it must be
Semembered, do not correspond with true differences of structure, but with different
Blections of a single structure.
