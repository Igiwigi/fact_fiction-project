Having thus endeavoured to sketch the general features of the fruiting branches of
these Lepidodendroid plants, I must now return to L, Harcourtii.

In Plate 1, fig. 1, I have represented at b’ a small segment of the primary tracheal
ring, which is being detached and is carrying along with it, at its inner surface, some
of the medullary cells. We have here a parallel example to what I have represented
in Plate 5, figs. 1 to 6, of my Memoir, Part XVI., where a similar are of a vascular
cylinder, fig. 8, carries along with and on one side of it, a cluster of medullary cells.
In fig. 3 we find this are converted into a solid terete bundle from which all recog-
nizable cells have disappeared. This example bears, in an important manner, upon
some questions about to be considered. Had such a succession of different conditions
merely been detected in an unconnected manner in several distinct but homologous
bundles, even in the same plant, though the facts might have given us strong grounds
for concluding that one and the same bundle could undergo similar alterations of
structure in the several parts of its continuous course, we should have had no absolute
proof that such changes did take place. But in the example quoted above we have
positive demonstration that such changes are not only possible, but that they do
actually occur. The several sections referred to above, were prepared with the
utmost care and exactitude, and represent the changes undergone by the same
identical bundle between its first separation from the primary tracheal cylinder to its
arrival at the outermost zone of the cortex. We may therefore expect to find that a
segment like fig. 1b’ of this Memoir may undergo similar changes, and our expectation
will not be disappointed.

Plate 1, fig. 26, represents a transverse section of a branch of L. Harcourtii, which
