Cancer cells do not grow as an isolated homogeneous mass; tumours are, in
fact, complex and heterogeneous collections of cancer and surrounding stro-
mal cells, collectively termed the tumour microenvironment. The interaction
Accepted: 13 August 2017 between cancer cells and stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment has
emerged as a key concept in the regulation of cancer progression. Understand-
ing the intercellular dialogue in the tumour microenvironment is therefore an
important goal. One aspect of this dialogue that has not been appreciated until
issue ‘Extracellular vesicles and the tumour recently is the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are small vesicles
microenvironment’. released by cells under both normal and pathological conditions; they can
transfer biological molecules between cells leading to changes in phenotype.
EVs have emerged as important regulators of biological processes and can
be dysregulated in diseases such as cancer; rapidly growing interest in their
biology and therapeutic potential led to the Royal Society hosting a Scientific
cellular biology, molecular biology Meeting to explore the roles of EVs in the tumour microenvironment.
