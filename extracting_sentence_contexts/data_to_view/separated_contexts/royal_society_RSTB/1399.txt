D. The Spores. It has long been known that the spores of Calamostachys ave often found a
together in tetrads, each tetrad being enclosed within a common membrane, %
doubtless the wall of the mother-cell. Cases of this kind have been figured in pre:
memoirs,{ and have also been observed and figured by M. Renauwr in
fructifications.ยง The latter author lays great stress on the arrangement of
in tetrads, regarding this fact as an argument for the bodies in question being |
nature of pollen-grains, rather than spores. || ; In Calamostachys Binneyana, at any rate, there is no ground for such a view, fi
spores certainly did not remain associated in tetrads when mature.
