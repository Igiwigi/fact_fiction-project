Although the eutectoid disappears at the same temperature as in the hypo-
eutectoid steels of those figures, the reappearance now occurs at a much higher
temperature. It is interesting to notice also that there is now no appreciable return
of magnetism prior to the crystallisation of the eutectoid.

The process of crystallisation in such an alloy may be regarded as follows :â€”
Suppose that the alloy, still at a temperature above that at which the excess carbide
begins to deposit, is cooling down. Eventually it will reach the temperature at
which it could exist in equilibrium with free carbide if the latter were present
in bulk. Precipitation will not begin at this temperature, however, if there is
appreciable surface energy between carbide crystals and solid solution.

Every re-crystallisation is characterised by the fact that, in the minute crystals
first formed, the ratio of surface area to mass is relatively very great. Consequently
the surface energy may be an appreciable fraction of the total energy of these
crystals. This surface energy virtually increases the chemical potential of the
separated material and therefore tends to make the temperature at which crystals
can form, in a given solution, lower than it would be otherwise.

The disturbing effects of surface energy become less important as the crystals
enlarge. Hence crystallisation, once begun, tends to proceed around the nuclei first
deposited. At the same time the concentration in carbide of the solution in contact
with the crystals approaches the equilibrium value.

This value decreases as the temperature falls, and is attained by deposition from
