We may
conclude, then, that in all the higher animals sexual periodicity, while conditioned
by the environment, is regulated in its successive phases by the combined integrative
action of the nervous and endocrine systems. The primary periodicity is a function of the gonad, the anterior pituitary acting
as a regulator, and the internal rhythm is adjusted to the environment by the latter
acting on the pituitary, partly or entirely, through the intermediation of the nervous
system. The further fact, however, must not be overlooked, namely, that in the
absence of the anterior pituitary the functions of the gonad fail, so that the pituitary,
in common with the other endocrine organs, conditions the metabolic processes
which are essential for reproduction. POSTSCRIPT

Exactly parallel to the case of the sheep which, on being imported into South
Africa, adjust themselves to the southern hemisphere seasonal cycle, is that of the
red deer which were introduced into New Zealand. I have not been able to find any
published records relating to the importation of the deer, but Lord LaryMer (1936),
to whom I wish to express my indebtedness, has kindly given me some important
information.
