They could not begin at Very Rare (on the theory of natural selection), because the
numbers are insufficient. But if they began at Very Common, and were developed
to suit the local conditions, it is a very remarkable thing that they increase steadily
in number down to Very Rare, and are therefore, so far as one can see, in process of
dying out. Yet another argument against natural selection, though it is not a very strong one,
may be derived from the fact that the families with many endemics, 7.e., the families
which on the theory of natural selection one would suppose very well suited to local
conditions, have their endemies rarer than they are in families that possess only few. If we arrange the families in the order of the number of endemics contained in them,
as in Table VI above, and add them up in approximately equal groups, we get the
result indicated in Table XVI. There is thus quite a perceptible difference in the degree of rarity between families
that have many, and families that have few, endemic species, and the figures progress
arithmetically, without a break.
