Raman analysis carried out inside the SEM chamber allowed
us to identify the molecular composition of these incrustations (figure 2b) as calcium carbonate
(CaCO3, main Raman peak at 1085 cm~'). The particular structure of such degradation suggests a
calcification process promoted by biological activity. In fact, manifold varieties of organisms able
to mineralize CO to carbonate compounds such as CaCO3 are usually present in soils [36].

(ii) Cross-section analysis

The instruments used for the characterization of the surfaces of samples M01 and M02 were also
applied to study the cross-sections of samples M03 and M04. M03 fragment was first analysed to better understand the gilded layer composition. As can
be observed in figure 3, several elemental maps proved the presence of two decorative layers.
