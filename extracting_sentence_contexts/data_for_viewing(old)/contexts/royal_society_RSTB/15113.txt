egg counts increasing from the youngest age groups, reaching
a peak in teenage years, followed by a decline across older
age groups. [95]. It remains unclear to what extent the
observed decline in egg counts across older age groups is
due to behavioural changes or an acquired immune response,
but there is evidence that protective immune responses in
schistosomiasis do develop, albeit very slowly [95].

An individual’s immune response to schistosomiasis (and
subsequent risk of morbidity as well as re-infection) is there-
fore likely determined by a combination of factors, which
include age of first infection, infection intensity and duration.
The fact all of these may shift following a programme of con-
trol presents challenges for projecting long-term morbidity
profiles in populations.

Schistosome worm burdens in populations are generally
overdispersed, with most people having light infections
and few people having heavy intensity, corresponding to
a low k value (§3). When fitting negative binomial distributions,
which are often used in models of schistosome transmission,
egg counts as a proxy for worm burden can inform estimates
of heterogeneities in exposure. However, understanding the
underlying human behaviours and ecological factors that
create these heterogeneities is challenging. Water contact is
