the part-magnitude being limited so as not to exceed unity, is co-extensive with the
whole theory of partitions on the lattice of m â€” 1 dimensions.

Section 8.

Art. 104. The enumerating generating functions that are met with at the outset in
the theory of the partitions of numbers are such as are formed by factors of the forms

(n + 8)

written for brevity All those which appear in connection with regular graphs

in two and three dimensions are so expressible, and the mere fact of such expression
proves beyond question that the numerator of the generating function is exactly
divisible by the denominator ; in other words, it proves that the function can be put
into a finite integral form. It is quite natural therefore to seek the general expression
of functions of this form, which possesses this property of competency to generate
a finite number of terms. Moreover, it is conceivable that such a determination will
indicate the paths of future research in these matters: will be in fact a sign-post at
the cross-ways. This is the reason why I undertook the investigation ; but, as
frequently happens in similar cases, the problem proves @ posterior to be per se of
great interest and to involve in itself a notable theorem in partitions.
Art. 105. I consider the function

(nm + 1)" (m + 2)*(n + 3)*... (m + 8)"
