If » =f, m = 1 gives a line too far in the ultra red to have been
observed. The observations of known lines by themselves are not sufficiently exact
to decide the question—as, e.g., in the P series. If we regard the doublet separation
of an associated series as determined by the top lines of its principal series, then, as
we shall see shortly, the evidence in the case of Cs points to the fact that the
denominator of the top line = 2+f, ie. 4 = 1+f; but there may be some uncertainty
here also in view of RypBere’s suggestion that each V of a series may form the limit
