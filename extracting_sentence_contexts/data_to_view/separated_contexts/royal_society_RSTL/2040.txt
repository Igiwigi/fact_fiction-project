As the early physiologists present to us the results of their own imaginings,
without eyen pretending to be possessed of any facts which directly support
them; the later and more rational inquirers have, from the causes just enume-
rated, been often betrayed into conclusions equally erroneous: and even in
making important additions to our knowledge, they have frequently done
what they could to render them useless and sometimes injurious to the cause
of science, which inferences, from a partial view of facts, often are, to a greater

degree than those which are evidently suppositions, because they assume the
semblance of legitimate deductions. Thus it was that M. Ls GaLLors taught that the power of the heart is inde-
pendent of the brain, but derived from the spinal marrow, and that the powers
of circulation in every part of the body depend on the corresponding part of
that organ; inferences apparently supported by the facts he adduces, but wholly
inconsistent with others which escaped him : and yet, at first view, s0o much the
necessary results of his ingenious experiments, all of which were correct, that
the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, after they had been repeated in the
presence of the celebrated HumBoLpT and other eminent academicians ap-
pointed by the Academy to witness their repetition, adopted all his conclu-
8ions, and were for some time followed by the learned of other countries. Many similar instances might be adduced#Â®. Ix order that I may distinctly lay before the Society the nature of the first
question to be considered in the following paper, it is necessary to obserye
that it appears from experiments detailed in papers which the Society did me
the honour to publish in the Philosophical Transactions for 1815, and since
republished in my Inquiry into the Laws of the Vital Functions, that the power
both of the muscles of yoluntary and involuntary motion is independent of
the nervous system, yet in both equally capable of being influenced by it, the
nervous influence being the constant stimulant in the functions of the former
class of muscles, and an occasional stimulant in those of the latter, which in
all their usual functions are excited by stimulants peculiar to themselves ; but
that these classes of muscles are influenced by it in very different ways, each
of the muscles of voluntary motion being under the influence of no part of the
brain and spinal marrow, but the particular part from which its nerves arise ;
while each of the muscles of involuntary motion is under that of eyery part of
