286 MR. C. $. TOMES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEETH The error in GoopsIR's observations was nota very radical one, and was probably, at
that date, almost inevitable, inasmuch as the processes by which more modern invyesti-
gators have the advantage of sceing structures in sit4 were not, then discovyered : neyer-
theless, though the error in fact was not great, the deductions based upon it effect a
wider divergence from the truth ; and the terms * papillary stage,” *follicular stage,” &c.
should be abandoned, as inapplicable to the phenomena observed in any teeth whateyer
which have been satisfactorily examined. The development of the simple teeth which
have no enamel, and that of the teeth of Fish, Batrachia, and Reptilia, has been but
little investigated, though the very early appearance of the enamel-germ in other Mam-
malia lends an additional interest to the inquiry. I was myself fortunate enough to obtain specimens of foetal armadillos, from which
