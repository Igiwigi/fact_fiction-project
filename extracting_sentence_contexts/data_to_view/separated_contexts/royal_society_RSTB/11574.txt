By contrast, if
AVA is in a Low activity state pre-stimulus (ii), activity rises upon [AA-off much more compared with control buffer-off,
because rises are observed in a higher fraction of animals.
his analysis is crucial, because AVA Low controls also show, on average, a spontaneous rise on the same timescale as do
stimulated animals. We confirmed that AVA rises upon control buffer-off were indeed spontaneous, i.e. not induced by
pressure change upon buffer switch, as the same change is observed during the pre-stimulus periods lacking buffer switches
(data not shown). Furthermore, we can conclude that AVA response is, in fact, not very variable once pre-stimulus state is
taken into account (80% responders in b(ii), versus 50% responders in a). These data lead to a new interpretation of
IAA-off responses: High-state AVA does not appear to respond to this stimulus, while Low-state AVA responds reliably.



(c) Step 3: Convert activity changes to state probabilities to reveal how the stimulus affects behavioural state. Many interneurons have been characterized to belong to either a forward or reverse command state ensemble (see the
main text).
