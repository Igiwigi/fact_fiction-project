The femur of
ARA-VP-5/600 falls below the regression line at all estimates
of FHD and below the lower prediction limit for most of the
range of its estimated FHD. We suspect that a short estimated
femur length is driving the very high index in ARA-VP-5/
600, more so than a long estimated humerus length. The
femora of LB1 and A.L.288-1 both fall far below and outside
the prediction interval for their FHDs; in fact, LB1â€™s femur
length is better predicted by the humeral regression than
the femoral one. In other words, the femora of these two
very small-bodied hominins are especially short, and this
accounts for their extremely high humerofemoral indices
that approach that of Ardipithecus (contra [70,71]; also see
[72]). They are not little humans in their limb proportions.
