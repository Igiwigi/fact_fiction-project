7 ROTATION OF THE PLANE OF POLARIZATION OF LIGHT IN LIQUIDS. 639

_ A consideration of the differences between the observed and calculated values shows
that at high temperatures the agreement is far from satisfactory, and the fact that: at
30° and 40° the differences are large and positive, while at 48° the difference is large
and negative, proves that the form of the curve has been largely modified by this last
point. If this observation be neglected, the linear equation

Ye = Yo (1 — 001188)

gives a much better agreement than Browat’s parabolic expression, the mean differ-
eace being only + 2 parts in 1000. It would, therefore, appear that BronaT was
Rrdly justified in using his parabolic equation ; indeed, even apart from the fact that
tRe boiling-point of the carbon bisulphide used by him is 2° higher than those obtained
¥§ ourselves and the other observers quoted on p. 644, we think that the character of
ls experimental data scarcely warrants the acceptance of his equation as representing
e true temperature variation of the rotation in carbon bisulphide.
‘g Independent evidence in support of this conclusion lies in the fact that if Lord
Raviercn’s value for the rotation in carbon bisulphide at 18° be reduced to 0° by
dgr expression for the temperature variation, it agrees much Letter with the deter-
Bination made at 0° by BecquereL than when it is reduced by means of Browat’s

5 Absolute Value.

® As all observers, except Arons, who have made absolute measurements of the
netic rotation in liquids, have used carbon bisulphide, and as the values obtained
them are in all cases lower than ours, we give at this stage a detailed examination
of the effects which are likely to influence the absolute value.
