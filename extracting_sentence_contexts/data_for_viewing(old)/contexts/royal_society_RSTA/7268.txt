frequencies. Their relative intensities do not alter markedly as the chain length varies.
However, it should be emphasized that each infra-red active skeletal vibration or CH,
rocking mode gives rise to a separate absorption band, so that the integrated intensities
of all of these should be compared with the methyl rocking band arising from a single
vibration. When this is taken into account there appears to be no discrepancy with the
theoretical predictions.

(c) The CH, twisting and wagging modes

The region between 1370 and 1150 cm~! contains a number of weak absorption bands
which may be considered as splitting out from the 1336 and 1278 cm~! frequencies in the
vibrational spectra of propane. That is to say, they arise from CH, wagging and twisting
modes. The fact that these absorption bands are weak and overlap considerably in the
spectra of the long-chain z-paraffins means that the task of separating them into series
is much more difficult. This is particularly true for the region 1370 to 1320 cm~!, where
water-vapour absorption bands interfere with the experimental study of the spectra.
Nevertheless, some progress is possible with the aid of the schematic frequency distribu-
tions shown in figures 6a and 6b. The first point to notice is that the limiting series of each
distribution have different selection rules. Thus, the limiting series of the CH, wagging
modes are either infra-red-active for odd and even values of n, or active only in the odd-
numbered molecules. On the other hand, the limiting series of CH, twisting modes are
either infra-red-inactive throughout or active in the even-numbered members. The second
point is that the direction of dipole change for the infra-red-active CH, twisting modes is
always perpendicular to the long axis of the carbon chain, while for both the upper and
lower limiting series of the CH, wagging mode distribution it is parallel to the long axis
