obtained, this acid was found to consist of

results differing a little from those of other chemists, who
probably did not take the necessary pains to obtain this acid
in a perfectly pure state, In conclusion, I wish to observe, that I purposely abstain
at present from making any further observations on the
preceding results than those already given. I do this for
Several reasons: in the first place, such observations will
appear with greater effect, when the whole of the facts in
my possession are laid before the public; and secondly, I
consider that data which lead to such important conclusions

as these appear to do, cannot be too firmly established ; 1
therefore, in the mean time, earnestly invite chemists in
general to repeat them, and thus either to: confirm them, or
point out their errors ; and for the sake of those who may be
inclined to take this trouble, I shall close this part of the sub-
Ject with the following remarks : 1. The multiples of hydro-
gen, carbon, and oxygen, are assumed in the preceding
calculations as 1:6:8. 2.
