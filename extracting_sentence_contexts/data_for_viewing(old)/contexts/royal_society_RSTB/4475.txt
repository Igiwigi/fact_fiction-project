60 DR. W. ROBINSON ON THE MICROSCOPICAL FEATURES OF STRAINS IN

BenAviour or Compressep Woop Towarps Potarisep Lica.

The facts regarding the nature of the deformations in the cell-walls of compressed
specimens and the interpretations which have been outlined above, received striking
confirmation by the use of the polariscope. It was found that the optical properties
of the walls of the deformed tracheides had been altered in important respects.

Under low powers of the microscope, with crossed nicols, the zone of failure, both in
radial and tangential sections, stands out as a very bright band across the unaltered
parts of the section. The band corresponds exactly in form to similar bands brought
out by staining methods in other specimens. On rotating the analyser to the parallel
position, the illumination of the band reverses and stands out as a dark zone
crossing a brightly illuminated section. Comparison with the behaviour of the
uninjured parts of the wood shows that in addition to the illumination being reversed in
the zone of failure, the degree of illumination is brighter than in the unaltered parts
