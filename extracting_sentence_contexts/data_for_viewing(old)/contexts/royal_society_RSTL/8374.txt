and consequent reduction of others ; but in all cases the reason of change is at once
apparent: how can such similarity in animals 8 entirely different be explained? To
all naturalists who accept the gradual descent and differentiation of all Paridigitata
from one common form, the fact must, appear as a perfectly reasonable and intelligible
one. If the immediate progenitor of the Paridigitates presented the given arrangement
of the carpal and tarsal bones, then, at the gradual differentiation of this type, every
small change in one bone called forth a corresponding change in all its neighbours. And
as the link which connects all the forms together was never destroyed, and the changes
were slowly going on, we meet now, in the extremely differentiated descendants, a unity
of organization which was inevitable if all these forms descended from one common
progenitor. But if, leaving the point of view of evolutionists, we look at the matter on
the special-creation principle, this similarity of structure in animals s0 widely different
is really an awkward fact. To the supporters of special creation the question presents
