Such a change of form—analogous
to the change preparatory to breaking which a wave experiences as it advances into
shallower water—would not be detected by these experiments, and it is not impossible
that it occurs to some extent.

(b) Reflection and Effect of the Joint.—The simple harmonic pressure-wave which
is propagated without change of type is accompanied by a distribution of shearing-
stress across the section. This shearing-stress depends on the square of the ratio ya,
and is small. That it plays no important part in these experiments is shown by the
fact that if there be a joint in the long rod the results are unaltered. Such a joint
transmits the pressure, but stops the shearing-stress part of the wave. As might be
expected, it was found that the faces of the joint must be a carefully scraped fit if
the wave is to pass it unaltered.
