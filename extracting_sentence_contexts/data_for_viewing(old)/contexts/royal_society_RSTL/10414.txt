As the various forms of regular cleavage may be explained as the result of variations
in the amount, of equally distributed dentoplasm (or in the activity of the protoplasm),
80 we may in part explain the various forms of unequal segmentation as due to

variations in the distribution of the dentoplagm. As shown in figs. 55-57 certain
spheres may be slower in their development than others, so that their descendants
are larger, a fact long since observed by ALLMAN in Hydroid eggs. This is probably
caused by the presence of a larger amount of deutoplasm than common, though poxsibly
to the tardy division of the nuclei, In the forms of © partial ” segmentation shown in
figs. 59-67, the large unsegmented mass must contain a number of fully formed
nuclei, since it breaks up almost at once into several s8pheres. Hence the delay is
caused, apparently, by some obstacle in the vitellus, which we may suppose to be an
especially great amount of dentoplasm in one half of the egg, as is normally the
case in the entodermic pole of an epibolic gastrula. It is possible in this case also to
8uppose that the delay is due to tardy multiplication of the nuclei, but this explana-
tion s8eems less probable than the other. In 8ome cases the small spheres are gradually
constricted off from the unsegmented part, and the egg may pass into a resting stage,
leaving a number of spheres only half formed (see figs. 59, 60, 63, 64). This fact
strongly indicates that there is some resistance to be overcome in the vitellus, for there
