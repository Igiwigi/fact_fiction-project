finally the nucleus is absorbed in the cell.” Again, referring to the experience of
SCHLEIDEN, that in plants it is nearly if not quite universal that new cells arise within
previously existing cells, SCHWANN remarks, © In animals—the formation of cells in
cells is the rarer case, but happens in 80 far as that a three to four-fold generation
way $uccessively form in one cell —In cartilage by far the most cells arise in the cy-
toblastema external to the cells already present,” I shall think myself fortunate if
any of the observations recorded in this or the preceding memoir, should contribute
towards the solution of these and other questions.

357. In my © Second Series,” after having applied the term © nucleus” to certain
germinal vesicle-like objects observed in the cells of various parts#, I snggested
that perhaps the granules or globules surrounding those objects might, rather, have
been the remains of a nucleus. I have now to state, that facts observed in the pre-
sent © Series” confirm the view then taken. Thus the germinal vesiele-like objects
in Plate XXVIII. fig. 245. « and S certainly correspond to those just referred to; and
they are situated i that which had been the nucleus of the cell.

388, Now $hould it prove that I am right in considering the germinal vesicle-like
objects of my © Second Series,” and those in Plate XXVIII. fig. 245. of this memoir,
as corresponding to the pellucid cavity in a nuclens, it will be obvious that, the relation
of such an object to a cell, is not © the same as that of the ordinary nuelei of cells.”
And since I cannot but regard those germinal vesicle-like objects as corresponding
also to some of the © hollow,” * pellucid,” and © cell-like nuclei” of Scawanxx, I ven-
ture to believe that some light may have thus been thrown upon one of the difficul-
ties left by that observer for future explanation.
