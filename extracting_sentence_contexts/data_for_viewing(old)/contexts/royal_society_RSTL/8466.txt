extending to the surface.” l

Mr. PENGELLY supports his view by reference to the wear of many of the bones, the
absence of coprolites, and particularly by the position and arrangement of the bones
and stones, all of which (except those in the West Chamber) were lying lengthways, fol-
lowing the direction of the galleries, implying thereby © that the materials of this deposit
were introduced and arranged by water flowing constantly in one direction.”

But it is difficult to 8uppose this to have been the sole cause; for a large proportion
of the bones are little or not at all rolled, very many of them are gnawed, and a few
limbs have been found entire, while several others were, in the opinion of Mr. BusK,
introduced with the flesh on them, although the bones were afterwards scattered,
These facts seem to point to the cave having been inhabited by animals at some time or
times. The absence of all traces of coprolites is not sufficient evidence to the contrary,
as in a cave 80 subject to the irruption of water, the residence of the predatory animals
could not have been prolonged, and their droppings may not have been placed under
conditions favourable to their preservation. Even without rolling, the fractured edges
of the bones also would often, like the angular fragments of limestone, be apt to lose
their sharp angles by the solvent action of the water 80 long continued or by weathering.

Of the 669 bones (omitting the 152 teeth) examined and arranged by Mr. BUsK,
67 are stated to be gnawed. But this refers only to the strongly marked cases; for,
speaking of the bones of the Rhinoceros, Mr. Busx says, * most of the bones showed
traces of gnawing by Hyznw;” and he makes the same remark respecting the bones of
the Reindeer. A certain proportion of the bones of the older Bears were in the same
