EARLY GROWTH OF THE BONES OF THE HUMAN FACE. 169

I have never Â£een anything like an approach to the formation of a distinct anterior
plate of bone, snch as forms part of the premaxille of mammals.

Yet, despite the peculiarity which results from the formation of the incisor process
and the shutting in of the intermaxillaries in Man, these bones closely resemble those
corresponding with them in mammalia. They have a similar wedge-shaped articular
Surface, fitting a groove in either superior maxilla; they extend towards the middle line
and articulate there; they form the anterior extremity of the palate; they bound and
divide the incisive foramina; they assist in forming no inconsiderable portion of the
sockets for the incisor teeth ; that they do not completely form them is a fact occasionally
confirmed by the imperfect character of the sockets which lodge these teeth in those cases
of cleft palate which have the intermaxillary bones isolated from the superior maxille.

Another interesting point may be noticed. In some mammals having a slight upper
Jaw, a Sheep for example, the outer wall of the nostril is smooth, there is no vertical
ridge. ch as that which in Man rises to the turbinate bone. In other mammals with
strong upper jaws the premaxille thicken towards their articulation with the snperior
maxill, and here is the most prominent vertical line on the nasal surface ; beyond this the
Superior maxille recede somewhat. There is no such distinet ridge on the upper jaw
itself, In Man the corresponding ridge is placed about the middle of the inner surface
of the ascending process of the upper maxilla, but it results from, and marks none the
less the junction of the nasal process of the intermaxilla with that groove on the inner
