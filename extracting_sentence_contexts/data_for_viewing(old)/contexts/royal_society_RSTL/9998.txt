From these equations eliminating Q,, Q, we get

Tz +2P.L—2P,;=0 or K=0

as the required condition.

The relation y,*=y;y, involving only the ratios of the solutions must be also
expressible in terms of the invariants of the firsb kind considered in this paper, and in
fact we find

where H and G have the same meaning as before.

To arrive directly ab this condition in terms of FH and G, we see on referring to (B)
that the cubic with the second term removed by the substibution for y of ye-ſ Vi.
