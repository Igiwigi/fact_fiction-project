There can be no doubt that the greater part of this bone is of neurapophysial
origin, though it seems by no means improbable that there is a small intercentrum
included in the lower part of its posterior surface below the notochord. The mode of articulation of the atlas with the skull in Eryops and Trimerorachis
makes it appear possible that the basi-occipital is an intereentrum and the exoceipitals
pleurocentra. This view is supported by the fact that the occipitals in the large
Amphibia always meet or nearly meet below the brain, so as to exclude the basi-
occipital from the brain cavity, and that the notochordal pit always lies on the upper
edge of the basi-occipital. The intercentra are the only subnotochordal elements of
the ordinary rachitomous vertebra. All Lower Permian reptiles in which the structure of. the occipital condyle is known
agree with Trimerorachis in having the exoccipitals meeting below the brain and the
notochordal pit at the junction of the two exoccipitals with the basi-occipital.
