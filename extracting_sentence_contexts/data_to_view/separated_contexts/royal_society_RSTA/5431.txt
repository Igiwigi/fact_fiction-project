The definition
of a path in the RAMI 4.0 for this communication also explains a rather disturbing context that is
observed today. Individuals can retrieve their own information and thus build their own ‘reality’. This underlines the fact that one will have to make an effort to ensure that the information
received by a party or by a technical asset is credible. Billions are spent on the development of
the system under consideration here, and an equivalent effort is necessary to empower humans
with the knowledge and the tools to be able to cope with it in a sustainable way, not only for their
employees but also for their command of this technology. As additional consideration for the capability-oriented 14.0-based digitalization, it is essential
to stress that it includes the realistic option to build small systems in a plug and produce way
without requiring sophisticated knowledge for the ramp-up.
