upper limit of the Glen Gluoy shelf, which coincides with the division of the waters,
is twelye feet higher than that of Glen Roy. The intervening space is nearly a mile in
length, moderately broad, and very flat, having only a fall of the twelve feet; and Sir
Lavver $tates* that he saw in this part the surface of the solid rock in the bed of
the little stream. These facts seem at first to indicate that two periods of rest had
superyened, one when the water stood at the leyel of the Glen Gluoy shelf, a second
when at the upper level of Glen Roy after a rise of twelve feet, and that, nevertheless,
the effects of these two periods of rest were confined respectiyely to separate, though
closely adjoining glens. This circumstance if 80 interpreted, althougl improbable in

the Spean, and that the short intermediate one in Glen Roy does not extend for more
than three quarters of a mile in that valley.
