of the defective region. Occasionally (two reversal and two control specimens) the same
sort of defective neural plate occurs when notochord is present (e.g. figure 26, plate 23;
specimen no, 19; type III operation at h.-p. stage; p.s. 2-0 mm., 80% of a.p.l., h.-p. 0-25 mm. ;
r.-p. 0-25 mm., 0-75 mm. behind anterior end of /.s.). This is due presumably to some dis-
sociation of the processes of the backward movement.

In these specimens it is of course impossible to identify the tissues of the reversed-piece
with certainty. But it seems probable that the residual blastoderm has developed according
to its presumptive fate; while the reversed-piece has failed to differentiate and in so doing
has been responsible for the defect in the embryo at the time of fixation. Such a failure is
reminiscent of the undifferentiated tissue sometimes found in an otherwise normal axis,
referred to in the description of partial regulation. It may seem surprising that the reversed-
piece can be responsible for the undifferentiated mid-line in spite of the fact that in the
stage and perhaps in the LM stage blastoderms it can hardly have contained the presump-
tive notochord and neural plate subsequently missing. But slow healing, which was
observed in these specimens, may have resulted in the reversed-piece occupying the
position of the primitive node at the time of the backward movement. From such a position
it perhaps underwent the tissue movement of node material but not the tissue differentia-
tion. Slow healing may, as with the tendency to reversed development previously dis-
cussed, be part of the explanation of the failure to regulate to a single normal axis (cf.
the poor differentiation of many unhealed excised-pieces described in ยง VIII). It is probable
