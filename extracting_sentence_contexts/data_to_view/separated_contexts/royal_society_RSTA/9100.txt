For these heights are not determined by the
energies in the components, but by their central intensities, which are proportional
to their rates of attenuation g. It is now possible to understand at once the reason
for the absence of peaks in the curve for H, even when the energies of all the
components may be strictly comparable with that of the central one. This increase
of “spreading” of the components with their distance from the centre is to be
expected from the fact that the change in frequency of the radiation from a specified
particle depends on the degree of proximity of other charged particles, the distribution
of which is subject to variations. If the arrangement of luminous and charged
particles were not subject to some probability distribution, we should find sharp
components as in STARK’S experiments.

(IX.) Details of the Components of H.. The theoretical boundary of the curve for H,, on the basis of Svarx’s results, has
been plotted for various values of g attached to the different components, in order to
discover the dependence of the curve upon these values.
