yy WouLER) as a chemical individual. The association between the urate and the
ellow product is extremely close. I have found no solvent that will separate them,
nd no amount of fractional precipitation appears to have any effect in this direction.
ff, moreover, the yellow solution from the tubes be acidified, the uric acid thus

ecipitated is just as closely associated with the coloured substance. It separates as
an amorphous yellow powder and remains obstinately amorphous, even if dissolved
re-precipitated an indefinite number of times. This association with the yellow

olubility in hot water. he figures yielded by analysis of the yellow mixture
searcely differ however from those given by pure uric acid, and boiling with charcoal
will, as before, yield a colourless crystalline product. It cannot be doubted, in fact,
that the “mycomelie acid” of Hiastwerz was but pigmented ammonium urate.
The results are practically the same through wide ranges of temperature. The
yellow substance is but a bye-product in the general process of hydrolysis which goes
on in the tubes, appearing at a stage in the process which varies somewhat with the
temperature employed. But the great difficulty is that, as soon as formed, it shares
itself in the hydrolysis, and no adjustment of the conditions will prevent this. The
consequent smallness of the yield, and the obstinately close union with unaltered
urates, make any attempt to purify the yellow substance extremely difficult.

The substance, however, is one of very high tinctorial power, and solutions of
pigmented urate from the tubes are of fine yellow colour and strongly fluorescent.
‘The colour and fluorescence of such solutions are indeed identical with those of the
