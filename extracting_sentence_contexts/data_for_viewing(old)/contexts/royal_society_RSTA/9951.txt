considerable importance from the points of view of both atmospheric electricity and
of terrestrial magnetism.

An analysis of the data for this purpose is given in Table I.

In this table, column 2 contains the number of times positive currents (7.e. currents
caused by positively charged rain) were recorded with values between the limits
shown in the first column, and similar data for negative currents are given in
column 3.

Neglecting for a short time currents greater than 300 X 10~* ampere we see that
large currents are more seldom met with than smaller currents, this being true for
both positive and negative currents. The most important fact, however, is that as
the currents become larger the frequency with which positive currents occur tends
