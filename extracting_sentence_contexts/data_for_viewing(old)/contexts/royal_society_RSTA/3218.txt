(b) No crossings on 1}, and 4,
We now show that A; =0 and, provided A. is large enough, Aq; =0. We use the following
result.
Theorem 2.10 [29, theorem V.4.10]. Let 1 be self-adjoint and V € B(X) be a symmetric operator on
a Hilbert space X. Then
dist(Sp(H + V),Sp(H)) < IV Ilex).

Lemma 2.11. The following hold for all L € R:

(i) Ai =0.
(ii) If dco > [IVloo, then Ag, =0.

Remark 2.12. In fact, the proof will show that there are no crossings on I), or 4. This means
the result Aj, = A4, =0 is not due to cancellation.

Proof. (i) This is equivalent to showing that the unstable subspace E" (—00, 4) of

_ On D1
A-@)= (1 4V_ Oh )

has trivial intersection with D for any 4 < 0. Let U; denote an eigenvector for V_ with eigenvalue
k. As V_ is symmetric, the collection {Ui}kesp(v_) forms a basis for R”. From hypothesis (H2), we
have k > 0, hence k — 4 > 0. Then vz = +k — d is an eigenvalue for A_(A) with eigenvector
