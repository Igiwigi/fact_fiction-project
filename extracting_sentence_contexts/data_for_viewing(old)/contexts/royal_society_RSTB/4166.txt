by another species found by us in the same dredgings, Marsipella spiralis, Heron-
Allen and Earland. The previously known Marsipella cylindrica, Brady, forms a
long and very friable tube, selecting for the purpose broken sponge-spicules of
approximately equal length (in contrast to Technitella legumen, which seldom or never
employs a broken spicule), Its test is exceedingly friable, and it would appear that,
a long series of generations of Marsipella cylindrica having suffered from this extreme
friability, it was left for Marsipella spiralis to make the same great discovery as did
the prehistoric genius who invented string—it has clearly realised that a twisted
yarn is stronger than an untwisted wisp of fibre. The spicules of Marsipella spiralis
are always arranged in a left-handed spiral, firmly embedded in a cement similar to
that employed by Technitella.’

In Marsipella cylindrica we have been able to establish the fact, by the finding of
perfect specimens (which Brapy was unfortunately not able to discover) that the
apertural end of the organism consists of a club-shaped head, often two or three
times the diameter of the tube, and composed of loosely aggregated sponge-spicules
from which a number of longer spicules (from 0°5 to 0°8 mm.) radiate in all directions,
thus forming an effective chevaux de frise which must prove a very efficient
protection against the attacks of parasitic worms, a phenomenon which is
exhibited also by Haliphysema tumanowiczii, Bowerbank, and Hyperammina
ramosa, Brady, in which species the entire body of the animal is protected in a
similar manner.

That the arenaceous Foraminifera are not always guided in the construction of
their tests by considerations of strength and resistance, however, is proved by the
