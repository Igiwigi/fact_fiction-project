If it does not make sense to associate a certain
concept with a certain observation, it is also impossible to claim that you have beliefs of what you
see in terms of this concept. Let us call this ‘semantic contextualism’. In contrast, it is possible
to urge that in certain contexts one is deprived of having a particular knowledge in spite of the
fact that our concepts for having such knowledge are well defined in those contexts. In quantum
mechanics, that would be a case in which we cannot simultaneously measure non-commuting
observables because of hidden variables. Bohr was the first to point out that the experimental context plays an important role in using
classical concepts to describe a quantum object.
