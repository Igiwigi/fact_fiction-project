The red and yellow pigments both react to background, expanding on a black, and
contracting on a white, ground ; and also as in Hippolyte, a blue diffuse substance exudes
from the chromatophore-centres when Palemons are placed on a scattering back-
ground, endures for a time and finally disappears.

Again, as in Hippolyte, the yellow pigment not present in the Mysids, reacts more
rapidly than the red.

As the facts abundantly show, Palemon is, from a colour point of view, practically
identical with Hippolyte ; it contains pigments of similar colours; these pigments
react similarly to light.

But, to return from the contrast, to the agreement, between these two forms: we
find, in the reactions of Palemon to white and monochromatic lights combined with
white or with black backgrounds, the same reaction to background which also
characterises both AZippolyte and Macromysis. The reaction appears to be general
among the littoral erustacea. As with white light, so with monochromatic light,
inversion of the light-conditions of the animal, putting, for instance, the “ back-
ground” above and illuminating from below, produces the same effect as normal
illumination, As Table XVI. (Inverted Backgrounds) shows for Macromysis and for
Palemon, when the background is white (scattering), contraction occurs ; when black,
