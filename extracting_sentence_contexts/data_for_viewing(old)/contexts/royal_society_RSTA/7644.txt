constant after a subsequent hour of observation. These results are plotted in
curve A. At approximately 5° C. above the critical temperature, no further density
change was observed with increasing temperature (critical temperature of ethylene
is 9-50° C.). After reaching a temperature 5° C. above the critical, the temperature
was lowered and the density was found to remain constant until the liquid phase
reappeared. The density then rapidly increased with decreasing temperature
(curve B). Even below the critical temperature with a visible meniscus present,
the values of the density obtained on curve B are not the same as those on curve A
at the same temperature. With decreasing temperature, however, the two curves
approach one another and coincide at approximately 1° C. below the critical
temperature. These results are in accord with the results of similar experiments on
propylene and methy] ether obtained in this laboratory. That the values obtained
on curve A are reproducible was shown by the fact that readings taken several
times, between which the medium had been cooled to a temperature less than 1° C.
below the critical, were found to be identical. The same reproducibility was found
for curve B each time the medium was cooled from a temperature 5° C. above the
critical.

The data in Table V were obtained when the volume was adjusted so that the
meniscus was always below the float as long as it was visible. The measurements
could have been made in the manner previously described, the mercury in the U
tube being frozen. It was, however, desired to make pressure and temperature
observations simultaneously in order to obtain the critical pressure, as well as
