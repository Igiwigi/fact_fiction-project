That with a particular instrument the forces increase with the rarefaction up
to a certain point, after which they fall off; this result also follows directly from the
equation (140). 118. Equations (124) and (140) first revealed to me the fact that the pressure
of gas at which the force would become appreciable must vary inversely as the size of
the surface. From equation (140) it appears that up to a certain point

and since 8 5 and pc p it appears that

Pe=P'® 5m FS

So that with gas at a given density the smaller the surface the greater would be the

intensity of the impulsive force ; and hence I was led to try the fibre of ilk, with

which I obtained evidence of the force at densities of half an atmosphere ; whereas

in the radiometer, with vanes something like 500 times as broad as the fibre of ilk,
the force does not manifest itself until the density is very small indeed. Earlier conclusions.
