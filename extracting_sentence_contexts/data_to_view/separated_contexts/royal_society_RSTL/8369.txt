Attempts were made to see if chemical action would attract or repel the index. I could not, however, produce chemical action close to the exhausted bulb, without at
the same time liberating such an amount of heat as to mask any other action.

94. Although I most frequently speak of repulsion by heat, and in illustrating any
of the results obtained I generally use either the fingers or the flame of a spirit-lamp as
a convenient, source of radiation, it must be clearly understood that these results are not
confined to the heating-rays of the spectrum, but that any ray, from the ultra red to the
ultra violet, will produce repulsion in a vacuum, I have already mentioned this fact in
my first paper (58, 68). Experiments proving the similarity of action of all rays of the
spectrum were shown before the Physical Society on June 20th, 1874+. They were,
however, tried with a less perfect apparatus than the one I have since used for the same
purpose, and need not be further alluded to till 1 describe the most recent results
obtained with the spectrum (110, 111).
