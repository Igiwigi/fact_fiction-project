rence of the same thing in the third year. How much longer the effect might have
persisted cannot, of course, be stated, but since the overgrowth is complete in this third
year, it is not probable that there would have been much of it in the succeeding year.
A wound may then effect at least three successive years of growth in thickness with
tangential series in a tree of this age. From a study of the character of the response
indicated in these three years’ growth it is evident, not only that the wound stimulus
persists, but that its action is more concentrated and definite in the vicinity of the
wound, and more diffuse and sporadic at a distance. Thus in the year of the wound
there are very few scattered canals, while the reverse is true of the outer years. So
rapidly, and to such an extent, has the scattering in these been attained that, had a
piece of the wood including only the two outer years’ growth in the region opposite
the wound been examined, it is very improbable that the canals would have been suspected
of being other than normal by anyone not knowing the facts already disclosed in con-
nection with wounding.

Again, when the complete section is examined it will be seen that there is sufficient
evidence in it to demonstrate the controlling influence of a wound, not only on the
resin canals produced by it, but on those formed by preceding ones. In the years
just before the wound figured there are scattered resin canals. Had this wound not
oceurred it is only reasonable to infer that there would have been a continuation of
the scattered arrangement in the extensive region where consolidation into one
tangential series has been effected. It would thus appear not only that the wound
stimulus can persist, but that it can be added to and co-ordinated with that of a later
wound.
