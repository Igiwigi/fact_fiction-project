I consider that we should take as one element of our theories the principle that
we have to suppose a stagnation of impounded air around the Pole over a great
extent of the Polar Regions, this impounded air being maintained by the influx along
the surface of the Earth of air frictionally deprived of the over-par of revolutional
velocity which is possessed by the great cap of air higher up above the surface of the
Earth. This impounded air lags, I affirm, in the Polar Regions, being unable, for want

of revolutional momentum, and accompanying want of centrifugal inertial tendency, to
take part readily in the great circulation between polar and equatorial regions. In fact,
it cannot get out from its imprisonment there except by being dragged away through
gradual entanglement with the comparatively rapidly revolving air arriving by the
great upper current from regions having more rapid revolutional motion and passing
away in the great middle return current towards the Equator.

(e.) Further, I may now offer some considerations as to whether, according to
theory, we should expect very clear skies to prevail in the Polar Region of impounded
deadened air. I think we must suppose the great upper atmospheric current con-
verging towards the Pole and having over-par of revolutional velocity must be already
very dry, owing to its greatly reduced pressure and cold temperature. So, when its
air descends in level to return towards the Equator, that air must, I think, be greatly
under its saturation point with water-substance ; or, in other words, must be far from
ready to form clouds, or to precipitate rain or snow.
