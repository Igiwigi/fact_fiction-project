The actual mode of progression
of Heteromastix is easier to recognise than to describe. It progresses quickly, though
not very steadily, rolling or wobbling slightly from side to side, though not turning
over on its axis. Small forms can be distinguished from the small forms of
Spiromonas (before the latter have become spiral) by the fact that their progression
is not so extremely rapid and the individual never goes through more than one or two
fields of a 1/6 lens before changing its direction considerably. Spiromonas displaces
itself more rapidly than any other of these flagellates, with the possible exception of
the darting uniflagellate. It is untiring ; I have never seen it at rest except during
division.
