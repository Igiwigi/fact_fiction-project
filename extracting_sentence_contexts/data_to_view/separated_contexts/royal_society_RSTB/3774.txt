honey in the other (ef the gyneecial nectary of the staminate flower of Ilex). At
any rate the fact remains that only that portion of the ovule (the pyriform mass
extending just to the level of insertion of the integument) is retained for this special
function alone; it similarly stores starch, but, having no other use, it is rapidly and
completely depleted in older flowers. The “stylar tube” is retained since the
secretion from a deep-seated nucellus must be taken to the exterior, and this rapidly
extending tube, pressed in early stages against a sealed perianth, takes on the
kinking curvatures which are accidental, and possibly spreads out into the charac-
teristic “disc.” The remarkably exaggerated and early development of this region
is not wholly explained by this hypothesis; an alternative view would be that it
retains a phase of the micropylar tube, as it existed in the ancestral hermaphrodite
flower, when its expanded head just filled the aperture of the staminal tube on
exposure and so corked the aperture of the flower and helped to keep the deep-
seated ovule from desiccation and exposure to the external air. In the modern
ovulate cone with the assumption of the cleisanthous condition this becomes
unnecessary, while the want of the old closed perianth enables the tube to follow
on unchecked, At any rate it is clear that the “ stigmatic disc” does not secrete,
but, on the contrary, presents marked xerophytic adaptations to resist the excessive
loss of water from its cells.
