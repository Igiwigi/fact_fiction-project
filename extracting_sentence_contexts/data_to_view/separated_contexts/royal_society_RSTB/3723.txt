Gornan has noted this especially in the case of Pennaniow (1900), when
discussing the latter’s statement that there are ray tracheids in Cordaites Clarkia. He says that all Penuatnow’s ray cells are tracheids on account of their pitting. With this as a basis and the fact that the ray tracheids have not been figured, he
goes so far as to question this unique example of their occurrence in the Cordaitean
forms. I have examined carefully the type set of sections and have found no
evidence to contradict GoTHAN’s conclusion. The Cordaitean and Araucarian forms thus agree in the parenchymatous and
unpitted character of the ray cells.
