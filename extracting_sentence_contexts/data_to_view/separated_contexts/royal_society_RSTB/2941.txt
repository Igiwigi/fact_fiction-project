Fungal hyphe are also found, sometimes forming dense
strands following the course of the vascular bundles. All indications point to the
cupule having already been an effete organ at the stage when its preservation took
place, its condition contrasts markedly with that of the well-preserved adjacent
fragments of the vegetative organs of Lyginodendron and other plants. This fact has
an important bearing on the condition of the cupular glands, now to be described. The glands form the most conspicuous feature of the cupule, by means of which
even small fragments can usually be recognised at once ; they occur on all parts of
the cupule and pedicel (phots. 1, 4 and 15, figs. 1-3, 7 and 11) and are very numerous.
