shown by the DNS data of previous studies [17,20,26] and the present DNS data. As seen from
equations (5.1) and (6.2) and figure 7, when R, <1, the exponents £4 are very close to unity,
and begin to slowly decrease with R,. By contrast, C4 slowly increases from C,(0)=5/2 and
Ce (0) =3/2 in the present study. When R,, is very large, the far tails of both PDFs are of the
stretched exponential form, with the same exponents f. = Bg [26]; however, the amplitudes of
their PDF plots are normalized by extreme values €/€ext and /Qext, whereas those in the present
study are normalized by the mean é/€, and 92/2. The variation of the decay rates C4 with the
Reynolds number may or may not be the same. Among many possibilities, it is interesting to
consider the following possible scenarios: (1) Ce and Cg increase in such a way that the ratio
C.(R,)/Ca(R,) is constant as (5/2)/(3/2) =5/3 or (2) Ce and Cg increase differently, but their
ratio approaches unity for large amplitudes at large Reynolds numbers.

Scenario (1) reflects the fact that the dissipation and enstrophy comprise five and three
components, respectively, which is a firm constraint. When all terms e or oF behave similarly
near the singularity [22,24], they contribute equally to the dissipation and enstrophy, implying
that the larger numbers of terms the weaker the fluctuations become via the cancelling of
fluctuations that leads to P(e) < P(2), with a ratio of about C./Cg =5/3. The number of terms
(degrees of freedom in the dissipation and enstrophy) determines the statistics, which is readily
understood in the context of the central limit theorem for very large number of terms in the large
spatial dimensions, as discussed below. Scenario (2) occurs when the off-diagonal components of
