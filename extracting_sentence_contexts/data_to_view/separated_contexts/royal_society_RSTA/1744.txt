This demonstrates that
the ignition temperature will be increased by the presence of carbon, and may be higher than
predicted by equation (2.4). Despite the fact that this estimate does not account for the actual
hotspot composition and likely overestimates the carbon content, it is likely that it still an
underestimate of the temperature at which a capsule would actually achieve ignition. This is
because it is an ideal estimate where only radiation losses due to Bremmstrahlung are considered,
and in reality other processes such as conduction, hydrodynamic effects and alpha particles losses
(ie. accounting for the fact that not all alpha particles are absorbed, and so some of the generated
energy is lost from the system) also lead to an increase in ignition temperature. While the hotspot conditions are key for determining if the capsule ignites, the main fuel
conditions are also required in order to determine the energy produced. The burn up fraction
of a capsule describes how much of the DT fuel is actually burnt (i.e. undergoes fusion), and can
be estimated by [27]

6.3 + pR
Using this equation, it is evident that the shell areal density must be around 3 gcm~? in order to

achieve a burn up factor of around 0.3.
