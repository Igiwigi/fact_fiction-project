They also show how an evolutionary process could success-
fully train output readouts stacked on top of those GRNs. These examples with physical bodies and gene cross-
regulation highlight a potential abundance of repertoires
in nature. They also highlight the importance of embodied compu-
tation [132,144]—the fact that living systems develop their
behaviour within a physical reality whose elements (includ-
ing bodies) can participate in the needed calculations,
become passive processors, expand an agent’s memory, etc. In robotics, this opens up huge possibilities [145,146]—e.g.
to outsource much of the virtual operations needed to

simulate robot bodies. From an evolutionary perspective,
the powerful and affordable computations that RC offers
through compliant bodies raise a series of questions.
