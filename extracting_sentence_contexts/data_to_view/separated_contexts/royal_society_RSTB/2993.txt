The experiment runs on, night falls, contraction persists. In the
morning a temporary expansion occurs, which soon gives place to a re-contraction. It is generally easy to allow for complications of this sort by performing experiments
at various times of the day, and by comparing the results; but negative results
become very troublesome ; an element of uncertainty attaches, for example, to many
of our experiments on the effect of monochromatic light, owing to the fact that
failure to produce a pigment movement does not necessarily mean failure to effect a
stimulation of that pigment. j

C, The Chief Colour-phases induced by various Light-conditions. Certain conditions of illumination call forth definite pigment movements, which
result in the production of well-marked colour-phases in Hippolyte, Macromysis,
and Palamon.
