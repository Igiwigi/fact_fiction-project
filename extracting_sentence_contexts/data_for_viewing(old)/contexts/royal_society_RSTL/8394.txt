which the writer believes it is not. That that thickness is not small, however, the writer
believes to be the fact upon considerations wholly different from those of Mr. Hoekixs ;
and that view receives support from the investigation of Sir WILLIAM "THOMSON as to |
the rigidity of the carth, at least with those who admit the sufficiency of the physical
data upon which his mathematical reasoning there is founded. The effect, however, of
this conjunction of the reasonings of the physical astronomer and of the geologist has
been to raise a new difficulty for both.

16. The geologist, chaineddown under 800 miles or more of solid rock, the real thickness
of which he is in no condition to disprove, cannot get his liquid lava sea beneath to the
surface; and he has no other source for volcanic heat and ejecta to snggest.

The mathematician has the fact before him; volcanoes exist. He admits the difficulty
of the geologist, and meets it by the most lame and gratuitous hypothesis of lakes or
isolated masses of liquid fused rock existing at different points and at different depths
(which depths, however, must, on the whole, be shallow within the solid erust of the
earth), and asxumes that from these the volcanic vents are supplied.

17. Nothing can be morefeeble and unconvincing than the attemptmadeby Mr. Horxixs
to give a rational explanation orsupport to this gratuitous and most improbable hypothesis,
which, s0 far as the writer knows, that gentleman was the first to bring forward in his
