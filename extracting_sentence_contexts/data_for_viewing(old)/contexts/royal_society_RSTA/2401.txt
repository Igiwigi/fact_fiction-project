figure 3a,d,g [63,71]). The parameters were later used for linear stability analysis (figure 3c,f,j). A
smaller dominant set of proportional modes (blue lines and tables in figure 3, where Ux = p;//™M
and ||p|| = 1) were also used later for performing nonlinear SDM.

Experimental stability (chatter) tests were performed for both the SM and the HT in order
to see the discrepancies from theoretical linear stability predictions. The results are summarized
in figure 3. In the laboratory environment (SM), chatter tests were performed with machining
properties MP, :{Z=2, ae =10mm, DM, D=16mm, « =90°, 1 =30°} (figure 3) on a dense
grid of technological parameters, see the green circles (SSC), the red crosses (chatter, CH) and the
blue diamonds (undetermined case) in figure 3a. It is important to note that there is a difference
from the theoretical prediction (black line) in terms of both elevation (axial depth of cut) and
‘resonances’ (natural frequencies). Both can be explained by the change of the dynamics during
cutting compared to the non-operating (tap tested) case. In fact, for the SM set-up a dummy tool
was shot by softball and measured by a laser displacement sensor in order to estimate varying
dynamics during spindle rotation (without cutting). Modifying functions were used for w,,x(1)
and ¢() accordingly [53] (figure 3c).

In the industrial (HT) case, up milling (UM) chatter tests were performed at a chosen spindle
speed only, in order to provide validation of theoretical stability analysis for each ram position.
The samples corresponding to MP) :{Z=8, ae =100mm, UM, D=125mm, « =45°, n=0°}
and MP3:{Z=8, ag =60mm, UM, D=125mm, « =45°, n=0°} are presented in figure 3fj,
where some differences from theoretical results (shown by black and blue lines) were again
experienced.

After the chatter tests, the nonlinear experiments were prepared based on the measured SLDs.
