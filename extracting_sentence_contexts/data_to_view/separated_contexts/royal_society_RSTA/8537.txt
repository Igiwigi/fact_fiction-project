We should have to choose the e’s so as to make

a minimum, where

This would give

2 (ry) (2,—-y,) = 0. bi oe

(iii.) The e's given by (65) are the same as are given by (61). For we haye seen in

If we express the w’s in terms of the 0's, and write

z [sy] y= =A,s,

then, by the condition of conjugacy of the o’s and the d's, and by (66),

A, = m.pe. of o, and = [sy] u,
nas 2 [sy] (s,). This is symmetrical, and we should get the same expression for the coefficient of 4,
in 2 (ry) y,, 80 that

Similarly, iff we substitute the values of v, from (57) and of z, from (63) in E[s,] v,
and in &(r;)z,, the coefficients of e«, in the resulting expressions are equal, Hence

(61) and (65) are identical equations in the e’s.
(iv.) The values of the e's as given by these equations are in fact independent of
the w’s or the y’s. For the value of A, as found in (iii.) above is

by (24) and (16). Hence, denoting the m.p.e. of a, and o, as in § 3, by x, the e's

(v.) The ordinary method of least squares would consist of making (v,—w,)’ a

minimum, and would lead to equations
= (sy) (v,-%) ad 0,

which would not give the most probable values of the «’s.
