= Action of Zinc on Glyozylic Acid.

BW A concentrated solution of this acid dissolves pure zinc without eyolution of hydrogen
& gas, and the liquid at the same time becomes perceptibly warm ; the reaction very 8001
4 ceases. Even if metal and acid be left in contact for a day or two at ordinary tempera-
EZ tures, the liquid will still contain a considerable portion of unchanged glyoxylic acid.
E The process may be accelerated, and may in fact be completed in the course of eight or
4 ten hours, by exposing the reacting substances to a temperature of about 80" C. The
Z previously colourless liquid will then have assumed a yellow colour, and does no longer
2 contain glyoxylic acid or glyoxylate of zinc. The pieces of undissolved zinc are found
5 to be covered with a small quantity of a white crystalline powder. Glyoxylic acid
A thus saturated with zinc was mixed with pure carbonate of lime and treated with
sulphuretted hydrogen :. the zinc precipitated as sulphuret of zinc, and the liberated
acid dissolved carbonate of lime -and formed a lime-salt. The filtrate from the Zn, S
and the excess of Ca, O, CO, furnished, on eyaporation, only one kind of crystals, which
possessed. the form of glycolate of lime. After purification by recrystallization from
boiling water, they were dried over sulphuric acid and analysed, with the following
