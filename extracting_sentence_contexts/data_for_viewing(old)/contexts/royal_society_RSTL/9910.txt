when the nitrogen is applied as nitrate of soda than when as ammonia-salts. There is
also more mineral matter taken up under the influence of the nitrate, but rather less
nitrogen. And, whereas with the ammonia-salts there is a decline in annual yield of
hay, and in the quantity of nitrogen and mineral matter taken up, over the second

period compared with the first, there is, under the influence of the nitrate of 8oda,
an increase in each of the three items over the later period.

When considering the effects of the two nitrogenous manures used alone, attention
was called to the fact that the nitrogen of the nitrate of soda distributed much more
rapidly through the s0il than that of the ammonia-salts (p. 306), and that, coincidently,
not, only were those plants favoured by the nitrate which could the most rapidly take up
the supplies near the surface, but those also which had a tendency to distribute their
roots in the deeper layers ; and hence, under their influence, there was a greater
development of root in the lower layers, and with this the growing herbage acquired
possession of wider and deeper ranges of soil and subsoil.

This was strikingly illustrated in the results obtained on the two plots now under
consideration (14 and 9) in the season of drought of 1870. In that year the produce
of hay on plot 9, with the mixed mineral manure and ammonia-salts, was nearly
23 ewts. below its average amount, whereas on plot 14 it was less than 1h ewt. below
its average. In view of this extraordinary difference of result from the same mineral
