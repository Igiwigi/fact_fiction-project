is always strictly less than Apijot. Thus, Apiot provides a lower bound for the critical compression : ~
ratio required to cause the emergence of non-trivial solutions. (8
To better understand the solution set, we can solve the determinant relation numerically. We aw
can fix a stiffness ratio 6 and find the compression ratio 4 as a function of the wavenumber k. An [3
example of such a dispersion curve is shown in figure 2 for the particular value 6 = 10. From this, 7g
we can deduce that if we were to gradually decrease the compression ratio 4 from 1, we would .
expect to see non-trivial periodic solutions emerging at Ac, © 0.89 with wavenumber ke; ~ 0.61.
We can repeat this process and track the position of this critical point as we vary the value of 6, as
shown in figure 3. As 6 decreases towards 1, A¢r approaches Apiot. For values of f infinitesimally
above 1, a finite wavenumber k ~ 0.941 is selected, but at 6 = 1, all wavenumbers are possible. For
B <1, we see the reappearance of a critical point, but it is in fact a local minimum rather than a
local maximum. Hence, surface instability appears first for all values of 6 <1.
For large values of f corresponding to a stiff film on a soft substrate, the selected wavenumber
becomes vanishingly small and the critical compression ratio on an infinite domain approaches
1, corresponding to the Euler buckling instability. A standard asymptotic analysis reveals the
following approximations (illustrated in figure 3):
