It remained for us to see whether there were issuing from such foci bundles of
fibres conveying the functional impulses originating in those foci, and whether such
fibres were arranged, as has been suggested by one of us (‘ Lancet,’ July, 1884), in an
order similar to that which prevails on the surface of the cortex. From what has been already done in this matter it is evident that the problem can
be attacked in two different ways, either by stimulation of the motor fibres of the
internal capsule, or by removing different parts of the so-called motor cortex, and
tracing downwards the degeneration produced in the motor fibres through the internal
capsule and crus cerebri,

In this present paper, we have employed only the former of these two methods,
viz., electrical stimulation of the fibres of the internal capsule, as exposed in horizontal
section of the hemisphere. Some knowledge of the arrangement of the fibres in the
internal capsule has already been gained by experimental and anatomical research,
and the facts as known at the present time we will now summarise. Hisroricat, INTRODUCTION. Previous writers, on this question, have investigated the subject by several methods
in different kinds of animals, viz., Rodents, Carnivora, Monkeys, and Man.
