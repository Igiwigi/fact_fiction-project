We propose
that in planning for investment in NBS to address climate
change hazards, a city needs to consider the effectiveness
of NBS to reduce climate change hazards and their impacts,
both now and in the future; the costs and benefits of
implementing nature-based versus alternative strategies;
and equity and environmental justice issues related to the dis-
tribution of costs and benefits across different cities globally
and across communities within cities. Answers will depend
on the particular social, environmental and_ technical
context of each city; in other words, there is no a priori
reason to expect ‘one size fits all’ solutions to cities’ climate
change hazards.

city may seem antithetical to managing technical impacts in implemented at scales that match the scale of hazards and
a city, but in fact many engineers are seeing the value of impacts caused by climate change [116] (table 2). Such scaling

incorporating a systems view and redefining risk in the questions need to be addressed in the contexts of individual


cities: their local biome, climate and hydrogeology (e.g.
sources of surface and groundwater); the magnitude and
types of anticipated climate change hazards (e.g. droughts,
extreme rainfall, sea-level rise); their specific SET character-
istics (e.g. spatial segregation of risks, the age, type and
distribution of green and grey infrastructure, and the social
barriers to implementation of NBS); and opportunities to
combine green with grey infrastructure. An important
question is how NBS scale with implementation area, and
how their effectiveness alone or in combination with grey
infrastructure depends on their physical position in the land-
scape [84,93,94,116].
