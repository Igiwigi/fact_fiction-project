We note that the pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, not only at the
margin of the membrane and at the apex, but also at the points for which « = 0-46a,
a value which is, of course, independent of the values of Y and P.

There are four points of maximum and minimum pressure, namely, those points
for which

x = 0°784 = 0°38 in., 2=0° 20a=0:10in,. ..... (95)

It is easy to distinguish the maxima from the minima by the fact that at a maximum
the tooth approaches the socket as a result of the displacement, which is a rotation
about a point close to the middle point of the axis of the root. In fig. 8, M,, My are

Fia. 8. the points of maximum pressure and My, M, are the points of minimum pressure.
