ductus naso-lachrymalis, only previously known in fossil Amphibia in Micropholis.

The small bone which I take to be the lachrymal forms the outer border of the
nostril, and has sutures with the nasal, maxilla, premaxilla, and with an even smaller
element, which appears to be a septomaxilla.

This element, whose anterior part only is exposed, lies below the nostril in contact
with the premaxilla and lachrymal. The doubt as to its determination arises from

the fact that it might conceivably, though I think improbably, be a bit of the
prevomer,

The palate may be described in more detail, as it was not very completely shown
in Dr. Broow’s original specimen.

Parasphenoid.—The parasphenoid is a large bone forming a broad processus
cultriformis, whose lower surface is nearly flat, but whose lateral margins are sharply
bevelled off posteriorly.

The parasphenoid expands to a broad plate behind the pterygoid vacuities, its
