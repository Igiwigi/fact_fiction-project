Hamshaw Thomas described the Bennettitalean flower Williamsoniella in this journal in
1915. Since then several new methods for investigating such fossils have been devised,
making this genus like many others ripe for revision. The material described here, which
was collected by Messrs Edwards and Wonnacott between 1932 and 1938 and which is
in the Department of Geology of the British Museum, provides the opportunity.

There has been but one important later contribution to Williamsoniella, by Zimmermann
(1933). He figured a specimen which showed leaves and flowers attached to the stem, thus
providing welcome proof of the hypothesis which Thomas founded on circumstantial
evidence. He also foreshadowed the altered account of the microsporophyll now put
forward. Various authors (including myself) have published speculations about the com-
parative morphology of Williamsoniella, but with the new facts much of this becomes
obsolete.

W. coronata Thomas is only known from the Gristhorpe Bed of Cayton Bay, Yorkshire.
Its age is Middle Estuarine (part of the Bajocian, Lower Oolite).

THE FLOWER AS A WHOLE

The flower consists of an axis bearing sterile bracts, an androecium and a gynoecium
(text-figure 1). A few specimens show all these parts (figures 19, 20, plate 25), but a good
many have lost all the members of one or another category. The bracts were most often
lost and their existence was unknown. That they have now been found is not due to new
technique, but to the discovery of fortunate specimens.
