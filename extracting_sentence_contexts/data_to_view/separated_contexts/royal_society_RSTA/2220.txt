Thus the apparent a link is not really so,
it is a pure coincidence. It is further possible that links attached to these lines may
reproduce other examples of this pseudo link. As a fact 15923 has a separation
17243 to 33165°51 and 19113 a link e = 17254°40 to 36367, which suggests a spurious
link a = 8202°25 between 33165 and 36367. In many cases it is easy to see that a spurious link must occur somewhere in a
certain region. For instance, if a linkage.
