bility for modelling different epidemic time series.

We tested ASMODEE using simulated COVID-19 epi-
demics, but this approach can be readily extended to other
diseases and contexts. For instance, ASMODEE could be
useful for detecting new hotspots of Ebola cases in large-scale
epidemics such as the West-African Ebola outbreak [37,38] or
the more recent one in North Kivu/Ituri, Democratic Republic
of the Congo [26,39]. In a different context, it could complement
existing systems for tracking nosocomial outbreaks of norovirus
at a national level [40], to help identify wards or hospitals with a
sudden increase of cases that would warrant prompt interven-
tion. The fact that ASMODEE is model-agnostic and can
include additional predictors beyond time grants the method
flexibility to accommodate additional factors impacting inci-
dence, such as changes in data quality, surveillance or testing
capacity. For instance, changes in testing capacity could be
accounted for by including the daily numbers of tests as a
covariate in candidate models, so that any detected departure
from past trends would indeed reflect changes in transmission,
and not testing. Similarly, periods of disrupted surveillance, e.g.
due to heightened insecurity [26], could be accounted for
by including the presence or absence of disruption as an
additional predictor.
