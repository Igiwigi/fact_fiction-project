If we consider the males and females separately, we find that the average value of

k for the 14 females is 1째59, and for the eight males 1째56, which of course means that
in these experiments the males have slightly more blood than the females (about
2 per cent.). The average percentage of blood to body weight for the females is
5째02 per cent., and for the males 4째74 per cent., which is to say that the females
should have about 6 per cent. more blood than the males. But that no stress can be
laid upon this is proved by the fact that, as the average weight of the females is smaller
than that of the males (females, 2183 grammes ; males, 2549), the females should have
according to our view, just as they appear to have when the blood volume is calcu-
lated as percentage of body weight, a greater percentage of blood.

Whether it is justifiable to draw from the limited number of experiments any
definite conclusion as to differences of blood volume in males and females is doubtful,
but if there be a difference it is certainly not a marked one, and accordingly at the
present moment we prefer to treat males and females together. In saying this, we
naturally exclude animals which are pregnant. It will also be seen that the indi-
vidual difference from the average blood constant & is smaller than the individual
difference in the percentage amount of hemoglobin in animals of the same sex and
very nearly of the same weight.
