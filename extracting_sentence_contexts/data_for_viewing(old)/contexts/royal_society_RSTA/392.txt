projected for later this century. Both the three-dimensional model of Bintanja et al. [59] and the
one-dimensional model of de Boer et al. [46] yield maximum Eemian and Hosteinian sea levels of
approximately 1 m relative to the Holocene. de Boer et al. [46] obtain approximately +8 m for the
Early Pliocene, which compares with our approximately +15 m.

These differences reveal that the modelled ice sheets are less susceptible to change in response
to global temperature variation than our 5'8O analysis. Yet the ice sheet models do a good job
of reproducing the sea-level change for climates colder than the Holocene, as shown in figure 2
and electronic supplementary material, figure S2. One possibility is that the ice sheet models are
too lethargic for climates warmer than the Holocene. Hansen & Sato [60] point out the sudden
change in the responsiveness of the ice sheet model of Bintanja et al. [59] when the sea level reaches
today’s level (figs 3 and 4 of Hansen & Sato [60]) and they note that the empirical sea-level data
provide no evidence of such a sudden change. The explanation conceivably lies in the fact that
the models have many parameters and their operation includes use of ‘targets’ [46] that affect
the model results, because these choices might yield different results for warmer climates than
the results for colder climates. Because of the potential that model development choices might be
influenced by expectations of a ‘correct’ result, it is useful to have estimates independent of the
models based on alternative assumptions.

Note that our approach also involves ‘targets’ based on expected behaviour, albeit simple
transparent ones. Our two-legged linear approximation of the sea level (equations (3.3) and (3.4))
assumes that the sea level in the LGM was 120 m lower than today and that the sea level was 60 m
higher than today 35 Myr BP. This latter assumption may need to be adjusted if glaciers and ice
