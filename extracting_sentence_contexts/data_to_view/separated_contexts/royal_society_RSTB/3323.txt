The average percentage of blood to body weight for the females is
5°02 per cent., and for the males 4°74 per cent., which is to say that the females
should have about 6 per cent. more blood than the males. But that no stress can be
laid upon this is proved by the fact that, as the average weight of the females is smaller
than that of the males (females, 2183 grammes ; males, 2549), the females should have
according to our view, just as they appear to have when the blood volume is calcu-
lated as percentage of body weight, a greater percentage of blood. Whether it is justifiable to draw from the limited number of experiments any
definite conclusion as to differences of blood volume in males and females is doubtful,
but if there be a difference it is certainly not a marked one, and accordingly at the
present moment we prefer to treat males and females together. In saying this, we
naturally exclude animals which are pregnant.
