Vertical exaggeration 26-4. So much of the Wolston clay of the auger traverses is a lake deposit that it might be
permissible to regard the small amount of very pebbly clay there occurring as moraine
dropped from bergs. Such an explanation would not alter the fact, however, that in
other parts of the area mapped in detail (figure 9), true till does occur. To quote only
a few examples, recent trial boreholes for a reservoir on the Campion Hills, Leamington,


AREA BETWEEN COVENTRY, RUGBY AND LEAMINGTON 225

at 332667, showed brownish grey calcareous clay with many small pebbles of siltstone
(Keuper), Bunter quartzite and limestone of Lias type with the unsorted character of true
boulder clay. In an auger traverse at Radford Semele (around 350644 and so just south
of the edge of figure 9), two beds of undoubted Chalky Boulder Clay were interbedded
with red plastic lake clays (section on figure 10), Other examples will be quoted later
when the general implications of the postulated lake are discussed, but it is clear that
the lake facies of the Wolston clay is equivalent to Chalky Boulder Clay and also to the
red boulder clays of the west of the area, and that the glacier which helped to pond the
water also advanced spasmodically over the deposits of its own lake.
