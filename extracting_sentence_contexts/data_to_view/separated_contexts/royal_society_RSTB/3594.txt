The former is still Pliocene, the latter is the earliest Pleistocene. An important
piece of evidence in this matter, proving that the basal deposit of the Red Crag, the
bone-bed or detritus-bed of Suffolk, was subsequent to the glaciation of the land
surface, is the discovery by Mr. Morr of glacial scratching on the humanly fractured
flints found in that basal deposit. The evidence of this most important fact is given
below (text-figs. 17, 19, 21, and Plate 17). It comes as a confirmation of a conclusion
arrived at by Lyeni from the presence in the basal beds of huge unworn chalk
flints.
