]. Introduction

If an ink drop falls into a pond, the stain diffuses away until no trace of it remains whatsoever.
One may naturally say that such a process is in fact irreversible. In the microscopic world, similar
phenomena are also ubiquitous. For instance, let us consider a many-spin quantum system in
thermal equilibrium where a local polarization excess is injected. Then, this excitation would
spread all over as a consequence of spin-spin interactions. Such an apparently irreversible process
is known as spin diffusion [1,2] and it can lead the system back to equilibrium. However, this naive
picture has its limitations. On the one hand, spreading is not always the rule, as there are physical
situations where the initial excitation does not vanish. This is the case of Anderson localization
[3,4] or when the excitation remains topologically protected [5]. On the other hand, even in cases
where the system seems to have reached an equilibrium state, the unitarity of quantum dynamics :
ensures a precise memory of the non-equilibrium initial condition. Then, if some experimental =
protocol could reverse the many-body dynamics, it would drive the system back to the initial 3
non-equilibrium state [6]. Such a general idea defines the Loschmidt echo (LE), which embodies 8
the various time-reversal procedures implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [7-9]. :
