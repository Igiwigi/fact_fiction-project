arise only in exocceles, but in the ecenosare may be formed in entocceles. A mesentery
continuous between two polyps may be principal in both polyps, principal in one polyp
and subsidiary in the other, or subsidiary in both polyps, its pleats being sometimes
reversed in one of the polyps. Mesenteries common to two polyps may retain the same
coupling or be differently coupled ; those of directive couples retain the same disposition
in both polyps or are differently coupled in one polyp, with or without reversal of pleats.
In buds the normal number of principal couples is reached when they are small, whilst
subsidiary couples are added until the adult condition is reached.

The presence of well-developed filaments on the margins of mesenteries of an extra-
tentacular diverticulum of Favia hululensis (fig. 22 B), before the formation of a stomo-

deeum, is a significant fact bearing on the question of the origin of mesenterial filaments.

The filaments in question could only have beenformed by the modification of the endoderm
where the mesenteries have split. If the new stomodzeum were to be formed by the
union of these filaments, it would be different from that of a sexually developed polyp, .
sincé in the latter the inner layer of the stomodzeum is said to be ectodermal in origin
(32, p. 197). If it were to be formed by invagination of the oral-disc, assisted by coales-
cence of the filaments, the stomodeum would have a composite origin, being both
ectodermal and endodermal. On the other hand, so close is the resemblance between
