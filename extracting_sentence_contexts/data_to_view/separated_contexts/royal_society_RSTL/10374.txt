The effects of destruction of the other angular gyrus, which however was less
extensive than that of the first, was somewhab unexpected, as being unlike the usual
results following injury to the one angular gyrus when the other is intact. At a time when any affection of the left eye was imperceptible, there was evident
impairment of vision of an amblyopic not hemiopic character in the right eye, 1.e., the
same 8ide as the second lesion. It would thus seem that the angular gyrus is in relation to both eyes, and that
though usually the eross effect is the only pronounced one, yet the direct one may be

ore evident when the other angular gyrus has been more extensively destroyed some
t previously. (See Experiment 5*.) The absolutely negative character of the

bsequent extension of the lesions into the anterior parts of the occipital lobes was
also a remarkable fact in this case. Experiment 5* (Plate 20, fig. 7). In this animal the left angular gyrus was exposed in the usual manner, and caute-

rised with the galvanic cautery.
