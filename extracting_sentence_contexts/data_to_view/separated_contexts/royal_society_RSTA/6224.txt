(d) Variation 4: topological constraints

The last variation concerns the representation of the free-energy contribution due to topological
constraints, which in [16] was associated with those terms in Ogden’s model that have negative
powers a, and coefficients jy, as summarized in §3c. In fact, alternative representations have
already resulted naturally from a variation of the representative chains (§5b), albeit along with
corresponding modifications of the free energy due to chain extension. Therefore, we here
consider the constitutive model that is obtained when only those terms with negative powers
and coefficients are varied and replaced by the constraint contribution proposed by Kroon [42],

later also adopted in [59],
W, =nkgOcy (2 - 7 , (5.27)

in terms of the second principal invariant and a positive constant c,,. The thus modified Ogden
strain-energy density expressed in the molecular statistical form reads
