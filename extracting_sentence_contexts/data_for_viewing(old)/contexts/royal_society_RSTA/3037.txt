direction in which entropy increases. As a result, the new theory allows the block universe view
to be extended, accordingly, to one containing an inherent direction of time.

5The net effect of time evolution for a duration a, At, in the forward direction combined with time evolution for a duration
of a_Afg in the backward direction is a net evolution of a; Ate — a_At, = At, in the forward direction as a, >a_.


5. Implications for humans

The new theory offers some support for our subjective notions about time. In particular, although
not evident from the coarse-grained approximation given in equation (3.7), the conditional
state |Yy(to,o,A))t represents the galaxy in coordinate time t as being spread over a small
interval around f = +tc. In fact, a more accurate expression for |Yy(to,,A))t is a superposition
of two Gaussian-distributed kets centred on the times t= +t, and each one with a variance in
time of

where 4 and @ are given by equations (3.5) and (3.10), respectively [10]. The fact that the galaxy
is represented by |Yn(to,0,A))t as localized in time is a sufficient objective basis to support the : 2
subjective perception of existing at a ‘present’ moment at time te. Moreover, in the previous : >
section we found that each conditional state | Yy(to, 0, 4)), contains, in general, physical evidence :3
of time evolution prior to f¢, and this provides an objective basis for contemplative human a
observers within the galaxy to perceive recalling the ‘past’. In other words, whenever the galaxy : <
