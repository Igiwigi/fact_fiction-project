Shortly after gastrulation is complete, the full number of notochord and
muscle cells have been attained, so that the period of differentiation must be equally
proportionate to the same ratio, i.e., the rate of differentiation as well as the rate
of cleavage depends on the product of (volume)/(surface-area) x (yolk)/(cytoplasm),
the surface-area always being the free surface available for metabolic exchanges and
not the total surface-area of all cells. The close correlation between the rate of chordal differentiation and the rate of
early cleavage and of gastrulation is probably due to the fact that chordal cell
division is virtually confined to these early phases. In other words, whatever the
egg-volume, whatever the rate of development, the chordal cells, first segregated in
the 76-cell stage as 8 cells, undergo merely two to three further divisions to form
about 40 chordal cells. â€˜These are completed before the closure of the neural plate
and before there is any sign of tail outgrowth, 7.e., while the embryo is still compact
and with virtually the same (volume)/(surface-area) ratio as the undivided egg.
