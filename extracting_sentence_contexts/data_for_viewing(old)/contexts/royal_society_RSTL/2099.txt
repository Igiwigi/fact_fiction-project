ing the same kind of electricity as the needle. Let the same
letters in figure 2 represent the electricities when the plate is
at rest ; thus, when it moves in the direction of the arrow, the
electric curve will assume the position of the dotted line a ;
and since it is of an opposite kind to that of the screen, it will
attract it, and will tend to draw the electric curve B on the
screen into the position b, b, marked by the dotted lines. In
this case the electric forces are both on the same side of the
perpendicular from the needle ; but since they are of opposite
kinds, one will attract, the other will repel the needle; and
according to the strength of these forces, it will advance, be
stationary, or recede. This explanation accords with the
apparently capricious nature of the fact; the circumstances
on which a direct or a retrograde motion depends are 80
numerous, and in the present state of our knowledge we have
so few data for calculating their influence, that it is not sur-
prising that the result of any given combination should be
uncertain. Besides the relative distances, we ought to be
acquainted with the relative conducting powers of the screen
and plate, —the intensity which can be excited in each by a
given inducing source—the quantity of that inducing action
which can be transmitted through the interstices of the
screen—the time each body takes to acquire and give up
electricity—before we can attempt accurately to predict the
result of any proposed arrangement.
