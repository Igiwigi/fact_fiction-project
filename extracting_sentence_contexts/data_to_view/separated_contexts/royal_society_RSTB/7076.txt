In
dicotyledons, the first evidence of leaf formation consists of periclinal divisions in the sub-
epidermal layer; in monocotyledons, the first divisions are periclinal divisions in the outer
layer. Ifit is true that the leaf primordium in leptosporangiate ferns is entirely the product
of a single cell then the process of leaf formation in ferns and of flowering plants is quite
different from the outset. Nevertheless, the evident fact is that the leaves in the two groups
have much in common. Considerations such as these have led the writer to undertake
a reinvestigation of the earliest stages of leaf formation in D. aristata. The method adopted was as follows: Apices were laid bare as already described and the
positions of J,, P,, P,, P;, P,and P; observed.
