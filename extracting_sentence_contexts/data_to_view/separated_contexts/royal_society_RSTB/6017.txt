20, B 2, 3, and in the crocodile, fig. 20, C 2, 3,
shows that their relations are similar. We may also note with regard to the epiphanial
foramen (f.e.) that Calotes presents a condition intermediate between that of the lizard
and that of the crocodile or duck, for in Calotes the foramen is relatively far back ;
in fact, it is only just separated off from the foramen olfactorium advehens, and the
ramus lateralis nasi (r.l.n.) makes its way forwards over the aditus conche (a.d.c.),
already external to the wall of the capsule. The cavity of the concha nasalis (cavum
conch) in the crocodile contains a diverticulum of the olfactory sac, but this fact is
no objection to the homology of the crocodile’s concha nasalis with that of the duck
which contains no such diverticulum, for the concha of the lizard and of Calotes
resembles that of the duck in this respect. Instead, the concha in the latter two forms
contains the acini of the lateral nasal gland, and it is interesting to note that acini are
found near the opening of the concha nasalis in the sparrow. In the mammal, the concha nasalis appears to be represented by a solid structure,
the crista semicircularis (c.s.), behind which the cavity of the nasal capsule extends
sideways and forwards to form the recessus anterior (7.a.), which ends blindly in front,
and thus corresponds to the recessus extraconchalis (r.e.c.) of the lizard and crocodile.
