The table shows of course the known essential difference between the behaviour of
the elements of Group 2 and that of Groups 1, 3, 6, signified by the signs of « in the
formula. It consists in the fact that in Group 2 the orders are formed in succession
by the addition of multiples, whilst in the others it is by subtraction, with the
exception that Cu and Ag of Group 1 are additive. But there are certain other
features which appear between the different sub-groups when higher orders are
looked at. The alkalies all show a gradually decreasing decrement with a sudden
dive. Na then shows a sudden rise continued for several lines, and Cs has a similar
indication. Cu and Ag with only a few lines observed show decreasing increments.
The alkaline earths show decreasing increments and a sudden dive (Mg excepted).
The Zn sub-group shows decreasing increments and then a sudden ascent. The Al
Sub-group 3 show decreasing decrements (Sc decreasing increments). O with 8 and
Se show decreasing increments. In fact, were it not for the very clear behaviour of
Zn, Cd, and Hg, the evidence would rather point to the conclusion that in each
group, the low melting-point sub-group show subtraction (« positive) and the high
melting-point addition (« negative). If this series depends on a formula sequence, it
is difficult to see how it can be any simple algebraic one—the mantissa would rather
seem to depend on a term similar to sin ma or tan ma. In the detailed discussion
above, however, it is seen how these changes of direction can be explained by lateral
displacements. It is noticeable that where the irregularity observed in the first. lines
as compared with the others in the satellite differences appears, a similar irregularity
exists also in connection with the first order differences. This is evident especially in
the alkalies, where the first differences are so close to exact multiples of A or é as to
cause the conviction that they really are so.
