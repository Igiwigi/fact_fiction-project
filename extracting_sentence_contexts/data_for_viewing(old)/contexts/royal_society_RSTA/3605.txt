be dormant or extinct comets [28], where both observational studies are roughly consistent with
a dynamical study that estimated a total contribution of approximately 6% to the current NEO
population from dormant or extinct JFCs [29]. Other observational studies have also generally
attempted to probe what may be the end state of cometary physical evolution [30], with some
attempts to also connect these objects with the delivery of potentially cometary meteorites to the
Earth [31].

The conclusions of these studies are inevitably uncertain given the similarity between the
spectra of cometary nuclei and those of the aforementioned C-, P-, T- and D-type asteroids
[25,28], which comprise most of the observed asteroids in the outer main belt, Hilda and Jovian
Trojan populations [32-36], any of which could also be the source of the observed low-albedo,
spectroscopically ‘comet-like’ NEOs. Identification of formerly active comets via dynamical
means is also complicated by the fact that Tj is actually not always conserved (§3), meaning
that the population of ACOs could contain a significant fraction of objects that are originally
from the main asteroid belt and are not of cometary origin [37-39]. However, more detailed
dynamical studies of these objects that rely on dynamical properties other than T) and instead
use detailed numerical simulations can potentially give a better sense of objects’ origins [40],
and near-dormant comets can also be identified simply by performing deep searches for residual
activity. Such searches have in fact occasionally turned up evidence of low-level activity (e.g. in
the cases of P/2003 WY25 = 289P/Blanpain and (3552) Don Quixote, among others [41,42]), but
this is not the case for most ACOs.
