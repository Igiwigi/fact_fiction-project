608 M. SHARIF ON THE EFFECTS OF

At 100 or 97:5% R.u. with 365° C the proportion of cocoon formation in X. astia
(tables 23, 24) was significantly lower than at 90% R.u.; but its larval life at the high
humidities was not statistically different from that at the optimum humidity. At 100% R.H.
only a few larvae spun cocoons, and no adults emerged; many of the larvae died early
owing to crust formation.

At 37° C the larvae of X. cheopis (table 32) died in the first instar and in a much shorter
time at 100% r.u. than at 80 or 90% r.u. Those of X. astia (table 31) behaved similarly,
but only one larva survived into the second instar. The larvae of X. astia also failed to grow
at 97-5 and 100% r.x. with 38° C. Some larvae of this species even grew for a short time
at 38°C with 80 and 90% r.u. The fact that its larvae can withstand 97-5% R.H. for
a much longer time than 100% R.a. appears to me to indicate the direct adverse effect of
a high vapour pressure on the growth of the larvae.

Thus high humidities by themselves exert an adverse effect on the growth of rat-flea
larvae, but only with extremely high temperatures. This is possibly due to either of two
causes or perhaps both; first, the larvae may be susceptible to ‘water poisoning’; secondly,
the high vapour pressure may itself exercise a harmful effect on them. Water poisoning,
as explained by Buxton (1932, p. 298), is either due to the inability of larvae to lose water
by evaporation in the saturated air (which prevents regulation of temperature by evapora-
tion), or the larvae may be actually gaining water of metabolism faster than they can
dispose of it. The fact that intrinsic injurious effect of high humidities is only perceptible
in combination with high temperatures is in favour of the latter assumption.
