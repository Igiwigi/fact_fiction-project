If the ionization at great heights had arrived
there by displacement from the F, layer below, then one would expect that the increased
dispersion would be accompanied by a lowering of the critical frequency. If, on the other
hand, the ionization were coming in from outside one might expect a slight positive correla-
tion between the two, since this flux of ionization might make an appreciable contribution
to the electron density in the layer. In fact, the correlation is positive ($8d). On the whole, then, the evidence supports the view that the ionization through which the
whistlers travel is of extra-terrestrial origin. It must be admitted, however, that the electron
densities required at great heights are uncomfortably large.
