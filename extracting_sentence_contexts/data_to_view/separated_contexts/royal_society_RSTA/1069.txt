} Following Spmaxman and Hirst, 82 are allotted as chemically equivalent to the 82 bases above,
leaving 23 for combination with amide-nitrogen, though, as a matter of fact, even more are required to
account for all the amide-nitrogen found. We can thus derive the following series of ratios, in successive degrees of approxima-
tion ;â€”
