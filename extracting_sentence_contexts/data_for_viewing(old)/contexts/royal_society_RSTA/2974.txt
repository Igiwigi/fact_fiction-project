distribution.

References [58-60] have some important theoretical results on significance testing for the
wavelet coherence. The results, however, are for specific ways of smoothing (namely in the time
domain only) and do not apply directly to our case. To our knowledge, no work has been done
on significance testing for the partial wavelet coherence. All our significance tests are obtained
using surrogates. We fit an autoregressive moving-average ARMA(1,1) model to the series and
construct new samples by drawing errors from a Gaussian distribution with a variance equal
to that of the estimated error terms. For each time series (or set of time series), we perform the
exercise 5000 times, and then extract the critical values at 5% and 10% significance.

Related to the phase difference (or partial phase difference), there are no good statistical
tests. This is because it is very difficult to define the null hypothesis. In fact, Ge, in [58],
argues that one should not use significance tests for the phase difference. Instead, one should
complement its analysis by inspecting coherence, and only focus on phase differences whose
corresponding coherence is statistically significant. The same kind of procedure should be used
when interpreting the gain (or partial gain).

3. The carbon market in California and our data

The California cap-and-trade system, called California ETS for simplification, took effect in early
2012 and is linked to Québec’s since January 2014. The first period occurred during 2012-2014,


with compliance since 2013; the second compliance period started in 2015, and lasted until 2017,
