culatory fluid, which would be a procedure altogether anomalous ; or whether, on the
other hand, impregnation do not rather take place from without, a presumption
which is strengthened by analogy, and by the fact, that the testis does not seem to
attain maturity early enough to fecundate its own ovum.
