Eggs, however, which had been kept for a shorter time, or which
had been diluted, warmed, or otherwise treated, gave results differing in different
instances. In some cases there was a reduction of maternal characters, almost always
accompanied by a decrease in size, at others no reduction, and usually no diminution
of size. These facts could be explained by two hypotheses; the first, that any
treatment of the eggs which reduced their vitality also reduced the dominance of the
characters transmitted ; or secondly, that a decrease of vitality prevents the larvae
from developing certain characters which require strength and energy for their
production. In order to test the truth of the second hypothesis, larvae were reared
in unfavourable circumstances which reduced their size and strength, and at first
(69A, 85A) no reduction was observed in the maternal features, and it was supposed
that this was evidence in favour of the first suggestion: But later (see Nos.
