weight of thallium, whilst I have endeavoured to show that experimental chemistry is
srictly a science of precision. Accordingly the determination of the atomic weights
of other of the elements (gold, chromium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, palladium,
iridium, lithium, glucinum, cerium, and boron) is not a matter of supererogatory
labour undertaken for the sake of verification merely, but is necessary to the progress
of chemistry immediately as a science and technologically. For, until these elements
shall have assigned to them more accurately their combining numbers, it will not
be safe to enter into theoretical speculations respecting the interrelations between
elementary bodies, nor possible to estimate them quantitatively without some error,
which, small as it may be, yet remains an inaccuracy inadmissible to true science.
One of the sources of error (that of neglecting the variation of atmospheric presxure
during the weighings), it will have been seen, frequently introduces as much defect from
the truth as impurity of the chemicals employedâ€”a fact that has hitherto been greatly
overlooked. Undoubtedly larger errors are sometimes admitted to general chemical
manipulation from deficiency or excess in the weights employed than would obtain from
the use of materials of ordinary purity, although in the latter case to notice effects of
variable pressure, or the loss by weight of air displaced, would be labour wasted.

Bearing these teachings of experience in my mind, I have striven to eliminate all
erroneous influence in the number I submit to the Royal Society as the Atomic Weight
of Thallium ; and I shall be amply rewarded for my long labour if I can know that the
determination has secured to researches of this character a nearer approach to the
standard of truth.
