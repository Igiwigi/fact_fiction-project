CENTRES,

Functional Activity of Centres. As regards Centres, the position assumed in the introduction* is, we believe, as a
matter of fact, tacitly in the minds of observers, if not admitted, and the influence of
“basal centres” is not so overwhelmingly important as originally supposed by the
older observers. To conveniently combine, therefore, the results without doing
violence to the theoretical views expressed by anyone, it is only necessary to arrange
the facts in relation to the part which is the seat of experimental investigation. A. Cortex.

(1.) Latent Period.—The loss of time which intervenes between the application of
the stimulus to the cortex and the commencement of the resulting muscular contrac-
tion is ‘06 on the average in the Carnivora. (FRaNcK and Pitres, BUBNoFF and
Heipennatn, ScuAFrer, ourselves.)

(2.) Eaxcitability.—This property of the cortex is greatly altered, ie., either in-
creased, or diminished by—

(a) Severe hemorrhage ; (b) deep anesthesia ; (c) cooling ; (d) drying; (e) fatigue ;
(f) peripheral stimulation of the functionally corresponding and other parts of the
body. (Busyorr and Hemeyuain, Buzzarp, EXNer.)

The latent period may vary from the effect of any of these causes as well as from
the intensity of the stimulus. (Busnorr and Herpenwain and other authors.)

* Viz., that the plan of the central nervous system, as regards its “ motor” side, consists in a cortical
mass of grey matter, and a corresponding mass in the bulbo-spinal part of the central neural axis,
with segmental representation of function, while that finally these two great central apparatuses are
eonnected by the direct paths known as the pyramidal tract or excitable fibres of the corona radiata
internal capsule, and, we must add, of the lateral column of the spinal cord.
