In
general appearance and from the fossils that they contain, they are similar to the great
pile of yellow tuffs that form the base of Pullo, itself a nest of late Pleistocene ash cones
contemporary with those of Sirima, Hohnel Island, and Nabuyatom. Indeed, it is
likely that the early explosive phase of Pullo was responsible for scattering these tuffs
over the surrounding country. The fact that they have been faulted and folded suggests
that they were formed before the movements at the close of the Middle Pleistocene,
though those occurring on HÃ©hnel Island appear to be post-faulting. About 10 miles north of Sirima Gorge the section shown in fig. 13 was seen.
