Local Flushing with a Solution of Neurine.—These conclusions are confirmed
é. by the effect of the local application of neurine solution ; there is some preliminary
constriction of the vessels, but the most marked effect is flushing of the intestines
g and a corresponding rise of the oncometer lever. It was a little difficult to be quite
sure in these cases that one had to deal merely with a local effect, for such small
3 doses of the alkaloid are efficacious that the absorption of even a small amount of it
= would produce general effects. The tracings we obtained show, in fact, that the drug
5 was absorbed in sufficient amount to produce a general effect on the arterial pressure.
2 We have, therefore, considered it hardly worth while to reproduce any of these

tracings.
8. EXPERIMENTS ON NERVES. We have stated that the effect of choline is upon the neuro-muscular mechanism
of the blood vessels.
