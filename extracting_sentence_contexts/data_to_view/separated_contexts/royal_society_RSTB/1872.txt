In this locality the degeneration, secondary to destruction of the auditory ganglion,
is extensive and intermingled with numerous normal fibres of the tegment. That
these degenerated fibres enter the internal geniculate body was assumed from the
fact that no evidence of their presence was detected in sections made higher up. This assumption, however, received confirmation and amplification from the examina-
tion of a case in which the posterior quadrigeminal body and lateral fillet were
unilaterally destroyed. In this case, which is described in the next section (d), the
degeneration of the fibres arising in the accessory ganglion of the opposite side
was well marked, and was traced in diminishing quantity from the corpus trapezoides
to the internal geniculate body.
