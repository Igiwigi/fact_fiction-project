The
ame remark applies to Mas80n and CourTfsrts. Every particle of the precipitates
they employed was a varnished particle ; and the constancy they observed was, IT
imagine, due to the fact that the main radiant in all their experiments was the 8ub-
stance employed to make their powders cling to the surfaces of their cubes. Gum or glue is a powerful radiator; in fact equal to lampblack, and it is a corre-
spondingly powerful absorber. The particles surrounded by it had therefore but 8mall
chance of radiating through it. T sought to remedy this by the employment of a dia-
thermic cement.
