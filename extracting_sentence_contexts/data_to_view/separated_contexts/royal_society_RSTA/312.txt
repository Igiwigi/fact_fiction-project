The main concern at present is to show how accuracy is improved, on a relatively coarse
_ mesh, by the use of more complicated but more accurate finite-difference equations, and it
is therefore undesirable to introduce errors, of the type discussed in §5, due to inadequate
relaxation of the simultaneous equations. For this reason the latter have been solved, in this
example, by means of a reciprocal matrix, similar to that of table 2, but incorporating the
more accurate derivative formulae at the boundary. The first approximation w® obtained in this way is shown, at internal and fictitious
points, in figure 10. The small numbers given to the right of nodal points are the residuals
still unliquidated, that is, the values of the left-hand side of (B. 8) with A neglected. They are
at this stage negligible, in the sense that their liquidation would not change any of the w
values by more than half a unit, but they should be carried over and incorporated in the
next stage of the process, to minimize subsequent rounding-off errors.
