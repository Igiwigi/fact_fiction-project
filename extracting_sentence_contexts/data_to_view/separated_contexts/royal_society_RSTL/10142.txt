also is the other in the same proportion, Thus the accuracy of our result is not
impaired by the uncertainty of this correction. In fact, although to determine the
resistance of our coil R in absoJute measure we require to determine accurately a
ratio of 1 to 3000, and this determination has generally been held to be one of the
main objections to our method, yet to determine the value of the B.A. unit we have
in addition to compare a ratio of 160 to 1. Thus, in fact, to determine the value of
the B.A. unit the ratio to be compared is 160 to 3000, or about 1 to 19, and this is a
much easier experiment to make. Our 160 and 3000 have both been expressed in terms of the resistances of the box,
and even though there may be some considerable error in the actual values of these
resistances, the error in the ratio of any two of them is a quantity very small indeed. In conelusion, we would refer to another objection which has been made to the
method.
