Hard Steel —With OO weights of 194, 388, and 779 Ibs., I observed
deflections of the needle amounting to 27', 48', and 1* 37', Another experiment by the

required to compress the yolume of it due to temperature, just as in the case of a perfect elastic fluid, applied

to which the expression becomes simplified to = M, CLAPEYRON has given a theoretical estimate of the
