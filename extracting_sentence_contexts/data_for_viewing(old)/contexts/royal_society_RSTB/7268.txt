TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY ON XENOPSYLLA 629

XII. Dormancy

Hibernation, aestivation or diapause has never been recorded in any stage of the three
species of rat-flea (Xenopsylla). They are holodynamic, and reproduction can continue in
them indefinitely generation after generation.

The fact that the larvae and the pupae of these rat-fleas died quickly at fatal low
temperatures (see p. 612) and fatal humidities (see p. 597) also suggests that hibernation and
aestivation cannot occur in them. In Nosopsyllus fasciatus, however, Bacot (1914, pp. 474,
539, 610) has stated that both of these occur in larvae within ‘hard cocoons’. In my view
the evidence is inconclusive, in the light of modern work. As hard and soft cocoons were
formed under more or less identical conditions in his experiments, it is suggested that the
larval food had at first a poor nutritive value, which gradually improved on longer exposure
to the moist air. Consequently, two types of cocoons—hard and soft—were formed,
depending on the quality of the food eaten by the larvae; it will be remembered (see p. 591)
that robust flea larvae reared at favourable humidities spin hard cocoons and weak larvae
reared at low humidities spin soft ones. The food factor and Bacot’s defective control of
humidity and temperature (which often varied about the critical borderline) resulted in
different developmental rates, and showed many peaks in the curves of adult emergence
