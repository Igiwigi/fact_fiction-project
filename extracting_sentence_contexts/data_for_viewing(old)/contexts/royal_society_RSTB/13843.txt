Figure 1. Three expressive acoustic changes that have a specifically vocal origin in the physiology of human/mammalian vocal apparatus: (a) smiling, (b) vocal
tremor and (c) vocal roughness. All three changes are simulated here by signal processing techniques, which can modulate both speech and music recordings.
