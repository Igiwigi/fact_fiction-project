tools were not available and localizing stimulation sites
was not easy. For instance, as acknowledged by Penfield &
Boldrey, there was a strong bias toward associating motor
response with M1 stimulation because ‘the Rolandic fissure
can hardly be recognized until after stimulation has identified
it’ [6, p. 398]. However, the idea that the hand hot spot
is commonly localized in S1 was recently contradicted by
clinical observations showing, in a large population of 165
patients, that motor responses were scarcely evoked from
the post-central gyrus [20]. This conclusion is consistent
with monkey data showing that the level of current required
to trigger overt movements is almost systematically lower in
M1 than S1 [56,57]. In fact, as shown by a study aiming at
comparing the output properties of these two regions, the
motor responses evoked from S1 are rare, weak and often
inhibitory [58]. Strikingly, in monkey experiments, the lowest
motor threshold is consistently identified in regions located
within the bank of the central sulcus for both M1 (Brodmann
area 4) and S1 (Brodmann area 3a). In humans, however,
these intrasulcal areas are not accessible and DES is only per-
formed over the convexity of the pre- and post-central gyri.
Together with the limited number of sites that can be stimu-
lated in each subject, this may explain why the hand hotspot
has sometimes been reported in S1 in humans.
