If this be the true composition, it shows a close approximation to the pinic and
sylvic acids, and yet a cause for the difference in the sensible properties exhibited by
these different kinds of resin. If such differences should actually be found to exist
in nature, the striking fact will at once suggest itself, that under the general expres-
sion C,, Hz, _, O, we may have a great variety of resins; and a till greater yariety,
exhibiting also more sensible differences in their physical properties under the more
general one of C, H,z_,O,,,.

IV. Action of Heat.—We have seen that when resin A is heated to 260? Fan. or
upwards, it is partly decomposed, and an insoluble portion remains when it is treated
largely with common alcohol in the cold. This resin is in mass of a reddish colour,
and is soluble in boiling alcohol, from which it falls as a yellow powder on cooling.
Dried at 212* Far. it does not melt, but at about 130* it begins to cohere- into a
dark reddish brown mass. Heated for twelve hours at 212®, and afterward exposed
to a temperature at which it began to cohere,
