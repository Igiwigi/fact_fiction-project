The same observation may be made with respect to making
f*@=»x, forin this caze V @=a, Va=myso, Va=n,
va=vz, and we in fact by assuming this value for f deter-
mine 4 from the equation

The same objection does not hold when we make f*v=x,
though this considerably limits the generality of the solution;
apparently the most eligible mode of determining F is from the
equation f"+! zy=w, ſor in this case Supposing we are acquaint-
ed with a particular solution of (@) containing any number
of arbitrary constants, such as
