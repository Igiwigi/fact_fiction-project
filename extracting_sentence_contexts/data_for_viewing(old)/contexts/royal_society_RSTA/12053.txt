To take an example, one experiment of this kind started with 50 cub. paces of air,
To this, oxygen was gradually added until, oxygen being in excess, there Nie
perceptible contraction during an hour’s sparking. ‘The remaining gas was ;
transferred at the pneumatic trough to a small measuring vessel, sealed by mercury,

in which the volume was found to be 1:0 cub. centim. On treatment with alkaline —
pyrogallate, the gas shrank to -32 cub. centim. That this small residue could not be
nitrogen was argued from the fact that it had withstood the prolonged action of the
spark, although mixed with oxygen in nearly the most favourable proportion,

The residue was then transferred to the test-tube with an addition of another
50 cub. centims. of air, and the whole worked up with oxygen as before. The residue
was now 2°2 cub. centims., and, after removal of oxygen, ‘76 cub. centim.

Although it seemed almost impossible that these residues could be either nitrogen
or hydrogen, some anxiety was not unnatural, seeing that the final sparking took
place under somewhat abnormal conditions. The space was very restricted, and the
