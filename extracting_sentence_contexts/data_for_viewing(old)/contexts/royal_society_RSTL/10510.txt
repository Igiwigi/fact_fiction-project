Sjolet, red, and yellow stages of Gerx's reaction are clearly een. If placed in a
Qest tube and examined before the slit of the spectroscope, and nitric acid added, as
he colour changes a band appears before D and one at F, then a band also appears
Ber D, the last fades away, then that before D fades away, and finally that at F. No
=Bther pigment but biliverdin behaves in this manner, as I have previously shown.*
D It is no easy matter to read the bands in the case of GMELIN's reaction, they
Slgappear 80 800n, but I believe the following are fairly accurate, for the above
Zolution :—the 186 band is about X 623 to X 593, the 8econd faded too quickly to measure
A and the third extended from X 511:5 to X 488,F spectrum 15, Chart I. Compared
Sith an alcohol solution of biliverdin obtained from bile, these bands corresponded
— These experiments were repeated several times, and the result was always
Fe 8ame. Hence Actinia mesembryanthemum contains in its mesoderm and else-
Fvhere a colouring matter undistinguishable from biliverdin. From the fact that dull
reen parts of Actinia mesembryanthemum assume a vivid green under the influence
If the acidulated alcohol, it is probable that a portion ab leasb of the biliverdin is
regent in the condition of a chromogen.
: For a long time I could not exactly determine whether the band in red specimens
Bf Actinia mesembryanthenum, occupying the position nearly of that of reduced
hemoglobin, was not the same as that of Actiniochrome, because Professor MosELRY's
drawing of the spectrum was lost, but on examining Punodes erassicornts, in which
Actiniochrome occurs, I was able to decide this point. The band of Actiniochrome is
nearer the red, and is represented in Chart I., spectrum 16.
The next point to be determined was whether the same decomposition products could
be obtained from the respective colouring matters, but as long as I dealt with 80lid
