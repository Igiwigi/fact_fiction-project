hardened in methylated alcohol, it was then put into a 8 per cent. solution of
bichromate of potash for two weeks, washed in water and in methylated alcohol and
put direct into Wxtcert’s hematoxylin for three or four days, developed in the usual
way, imbedded in paraftin after passing through absolute alcohol and oil of cloves, and
the sections mounted after removing the paraffin by xylol.

Direction of the Sections.—In the following descriptions the sections of the brain
were cut in the following planes, viz., sagittal, horizontal, frontal, and fronto-oblique.
The sagittal sections were made in a plane which is in a vertical and an antero
posterior direction, in fact parallel to the median surface of one hemisphere. The
horizontal sections were cut in a plane which would be horizontal in Man or Monkey
when in the erect position. This plane is, therefore, at right angles to the sagittal
and along the greatest length of the brain, namely, from the tip of the frontal lobe in
front to the tip of the occipital behind. The frontal sections were cut in a plane at
right angles to the horizontal, viz., transversely across both hemispheres and in a
vertical line. In the fronto-oblique sections the plane was transverse, but instead of
being vertical or horizontal it inclines upwards and forwards and downwards and
backwards so as to be parallel to the long axis of the medulla oblongata and pons
Varolii.

In this way sections were obtained of the brain corresponding to the three dimen-
sions of space; and, for the sake of comparison with the brain of Man, the animal is
