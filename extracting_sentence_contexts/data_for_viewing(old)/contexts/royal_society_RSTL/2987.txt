many cases which I have already explained, the simultaneous affection of the two re-
tine excites a different idea in the mind to that consequent on either of the single
impressions, the latter giving rise to the idea of a representation on a plane surface,

the former to that of an object in relief; these things could not occur did we see
with only one eye at a time.

Du Tour# held that though we might occasionally sce at the same time with both
eyes, yet the mind cannot be affected simultaneously by two corresponding points of
the two images. He was led to this opinion by the curious facts alluded to in \ 14.
It would be difficult to disprove this conjecture by experiment; but all that the expe-
riments adduced in its favour, and others relating to the disappearance of objects to
one eye really proves, is, that the mind is inattentive to impressions made on one re-
tina when it cannot combine the impressions on the two retina together 80 as to
resemble the perception of scme external objects; but they afford no ground what-
ever for supposing that the mind cannot under any circumstances attend to im-
pressions made simultaneously on points of the two retinz, when they harmonize
with each other in suggesting to the mind the same idea.

A perfectly original theory has been recently advanced by M. Lzexor4h, who has
endeayoured to prove, that instead of pictures on the retinz, images of three dimen-
sions are formed in the vitreous humour which we perceive by means of nervous fila-
