seems that a portion of the cortex had been torn off with the leaf-base.§

In the larger petioles the Sparganum zone consists of bands of sclerenchyma much
elongated radially, resembling that of the Myeloxylon radiatum of Renauur. The
bands are separated by broad tracts of parenchyma. In the smaller specimens the
bands are shorter radially, more crowded, and sometimes confluent.

Tangential sections show that the fibrous bands have an accurately parallel
course (cf: Plate 28, Phot. 8); anastomosis by means of a narrow, oblique, connecting
strand has been observed. Parenchymatous cells occasionally occur among the
fibres, which have a much-thickened wall, but preserve a different lumen.

The facts concerning our Kalymma may be summarised as follows :—

1, Vascular bundles in a single ring, crowded in the smaller, scattered in the
larger, petioles.

2. Bundles commonly elongated, as seen in transverse section, at right angles to
the surface. In the smaller specimens fusion of the bundles frequent.
