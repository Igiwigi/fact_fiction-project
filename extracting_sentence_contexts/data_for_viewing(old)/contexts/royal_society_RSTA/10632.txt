horizontal component, and hence the fact that they are distant from one another by
about 1 millim, from centre to centre can produce no error.

The insulation of the circuits was tested before and after the experiments and was
found to exceed 200 megohms both from one circuit to the other and from each of
the circuits to the flanges. The insulation of the rubber-covered leads and of
the Pohl commutator used to reverse the current was also tested and found
practically infinite.

The metal of which the flanges were cast was specially mixed by the founders so
as to avoid the presence of any iron, and these castings, as well as all metal used in
the construction of the coils, were carefully tested for magnetism by means of a
delicate magnetometer. The fact that the instrument is free from magnetism was

also tested by using the magnetometer which carries the coils to measure H at Kew
while the coils were in place. The difference between the value obtained and that
given by the Kew Observatory magnetograph curves was the same as the difference
when the coils were removed.

When measuring the dimensions of the coils two micrometer microscopes were
employed. These microscopes are attached to two carriages which move along a
V-groove in a heavy iron bed-plate and can be clamped at any distance apart. By
