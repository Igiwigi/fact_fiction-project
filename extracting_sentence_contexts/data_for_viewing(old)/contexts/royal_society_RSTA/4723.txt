to consider a characterization of the dual spaces. We let p € [1, 00) and (p,q) be a conjugate pair in
this section.

Theorem 2.5. The space (Ry is isometrically isomorphic to L4.,, and hence we may identify (LEY =

Lh. and the duality pairing of f € Lh. withue ae is given by

T
(Fy = I, (F(E), u(E)) x(n), x(0)

To prove this theorem, although we can exploit the fact that the pullback is in a Bochner space,
showing that the natural duality map is isometric is not so straightforward because ¢,.) is not
assumed to be an isometry. In fact, we have to go back to the foundations and emulate the proof
for the dual space identification for Bochner spaces [16, §IV].

Lemma 2.6. For every g €L4.., the expression

T
= I, (G.FO)xxe forall f EL’, (23)

defines a functional | € (LR such that |\I|| = Iiglliy.-


Proof. Let g €L. and define |: Ly — Rby (2.3); the integral is well defined by similar reasoning
as before (see lemma 2.13 in [6] and the electronic supplementary material, S3). By Hélder’s
