Even from the very first it has an indistinct form of termination and a
S fibrous appearance, while the protoplasm of which it is composed becomes very
© attenuated towards its termination. E The points of origin of the anterior roots from the spinal cords are separated from
S each other by considerable intervals. In this fact, and also in the nerves of the two
© sides never being united with each other in the ventral median line, the anterior roots
2 exhibit a marked contrast to the posterior. S "There exists, then, in Torpedo-embryos by the end of this stage distinct rudiments of
= both the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. 'These rudiments are at first
2 quite independent of and disconnected with each other, and both take their rise as
Soutgrowths of the epiblast of the neural canal.
