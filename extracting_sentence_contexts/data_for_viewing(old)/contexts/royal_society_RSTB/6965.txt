It does not follow that all these criteria will be evident at all sites. The Pinus maxi-
mum, at fen-margin sites, may be merged in a longer period of dominance by local
pine woods, or other fen woods. The same may be true of Betula. Fagus is also not of
much diagnostic value save in sites on the eastern fen margin close enough to the chalk,
on which the beech grew: this we know from the substantial amounts of pollen. The
behaviour of the Ulmus and Tilia curves is more consistent, as both were widespread
upland trees, but local pollen from fen woods may reduce their relative proportions so
much as to give the curves a dubious validity. In this zone also the Corylus begins to
rise, although this is more marked in the following zone. The Corylus curve also is
much more irregular in behaviour than the rest, changing greatly from site to site.

Although these qualifications are necessary, -it is, nevertheless, a striking fact that
similar changes to these can be readily seen in other parts of Britain, as far afield, at
least, as Somerset, Shropshire, and Cardiganshire. It represents, therefore, a well-
marked and general climatic change, and it seems reasonable to regard it as the onset
of the climatic ‘“‘deterioration”’ which indicates the change from sub-Boreal to sub-
Atlantic all over north-western Europe. At the same time it is evident that this
“‘deterioration”’ was not necessarily sudden, and we propose to use the transition
zone VII—-VIII to cover this period of change. The cold and wet conditions of zone VIII,
which we regard as equivalent to the sub-Atlantic, were by no means always recog-
nizable in the local vegetation of the transition zone. Thus the Pinus pollen maximum
is often related to local layers of pine wood, and the rising Betula to local birch woods.
Zone VII-VIII must have still been conspicuously dry in many parts of the Fenland.
