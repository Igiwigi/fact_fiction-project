to gate closure may be associated with the fact that a given contract becomes the front 15-min
contract. The maximum value of 30512 trades is observed 1 min to gate closure.

The total trading volume increases from 12 GW to 48 GW between 3 and 1 h to gate closure.
Thereafter, trading volume almost triples to 135 GW half an hour to gate closure. 15 and 13 min
before gate closure, total trading volume raises to 261GW and 314GW, respectively, which
coincides with becoming the front 15-min contract. A comparison with the number of trades at
these points in time in figure 4 reveals that indeed a vast number of transactions is executed but
with comparatively low trading volumes. The total trading volume peaks at 960 GW one minute
to gate closure.

Thus, we observe that liquidity of 15-min contracts rises severely within the last trading hour
prior to gate closure: on average, roughly 68% of the number of transactions are executed and
