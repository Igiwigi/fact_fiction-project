THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM. 747

B. Modifications necessary on account of Hysteresis.

71. This seems to be the place to consider what bearing the phenomena of hysteresis
have upon such theories as the present. No theory of electromagnetism can be
considered complete unless it takes this important group of facts into account. I do
not here propose to give a theory of hysteresis—so that the present theory must be
in this sense confessed incomplete—but it is necessary to notice what modifications
ought strictly to be made in the assumptions hitherto adopted.

Professor Ewine (‘Phil. Mag.,’* V., vol. 30 [1890], p. 205), has given a theory
which adapts itself to dynamical methods such as the present. In his theory the
phenomena of hysteresis depend upon the fact that groups of molecules can have
various stable configurations, different groups at any instant having very different
degrees of stability. The stability of a group is liable by variation of H and W to
break down, so that the group takes up another configuration of greater or less
stability, and the oscillations which necessarily ensue on the change result to our
senses in the production of heat. On this view hysteresis is a phenomenon that
