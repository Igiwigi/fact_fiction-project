anxiety wives at this age—at which they often become grandmothers—regard the
event of childbirth, we may look upon the above statement as trustworthy.
The moral restraint exercises its influence also on the natality of the fathers, though
the effect of it is weaker than in the case of mothers. At the age of 35-40 we find
against the physiological natality of 100 an actual of 73, and at the age 40-45 a
natality of 50 per cent.

8. Natality According to the Age Combination of Both Parents.

Passing to the enquiry into the natal probability according to the age combination
of both parents, we find ourselves face to face with such an overwhelming quantity of
facts, that it is impossible to deal with them one by one. Up to this point we had to
deal with the course of two curves only, one of the mothers and the other of the
fathers. But each single element of these curves is really an average of most
different probabilities according to the various ages of the other parent.

If we resolve these average natalities into as many elements as the years of age of
the other parent, we ought to divide each figure of female monogenous natality into
about 40 constitutive parts (according to the about 40 years included in the period of
male fertility), and each figure of the male monogenous uatality into about 35 parts
(according to the age of the mothers). Thus, instead of the two monogenous curves,
we should arrive at about 75 bigenous curves. The Table of Natality inserted here
as No. I. contains the whole rough material, that is, the number of families
living in the productive period of life and observed during the four years
