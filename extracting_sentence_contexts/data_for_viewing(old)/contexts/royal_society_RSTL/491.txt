with an equable Velocity.

Every experiment relative to sound coincides with the obser-
vation already quoted from Newron, that all undulations are
propagated through the air with equal velocity; and this is
further confirmed by calculations. (LacrRance. Misc. Taur.
Vol. I. p. 91. Also, much more concisely, in my Syllabus of a
course of Lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy,
about to be published. Article 28g.) If the impulse be s0 great
as materially to disturb the density of the medium, it will be no
longer homogeneous ; but, as far as concerns our senses, the
quantity of motion may be considered as infinitely small. It is
surprising that EULER, although aware of the matter of fact,
Should still have maintained, that the more frequent undulations
are more rapidly propagated. (Theor. mus. and Conject. phys.)
It is possible, that the actual velocity of the particles of the
luminiferous ether may bear a much less proportion to the velo-
city of the undulations than in sound ; for light may be excited
by the motion of a body moving at the rate of only one mile
in the time that light moves a hundred millions,
