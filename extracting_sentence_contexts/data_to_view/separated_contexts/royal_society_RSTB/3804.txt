The terminal
supero-marginalia from Annetorp (Sweden) and Rejstrup (Denmark) differ again, as
they are high and narrow with a prominent abactinal tumidity (Plate 10, fig. 9). It is probable that the great majority of the individuals had extended arms due to
the breaking down of the large terminal supero-marginalia as has already been
described in the case of the radiate variety of M. twmidus. In fact no large terminal
supero-marginalia are found in the higher beds of the Danian (see p. 148). THE METOPASTER UNCATUS SERIES,

We have seen that the study of the evolution of the M. Parkinsoni series shows
lines of development which lead to—

(1) The loss of spine pits.

(2) An increase in height of the marginalia.

(3) Various changes in the shape of the surface of the supero-marginalia.

(4) A breaking down of the component plates which, when fused, constitute the
characteristic paired ultimate supero-marginalia.
