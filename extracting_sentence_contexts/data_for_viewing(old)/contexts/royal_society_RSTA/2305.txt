cannot be trivial, i.e. always giving the same output independently of the input state. If they
are not trivial, then p(01|00)=1 implies that both effects Eoj and Ej\9 have 1 as eigenvalue.
Since it is a qubit measurement, by the completeness relation Egjg + E1j9 = 1, it follows that
the measurement is projective, and, then, that the initial state and the intermediate state, i.e.
after the first measurement, are pure. The same argument applies to Eq; and E41. This is,
however, in contradiction with the condition p(00|10) = 1. Notice that we did not use the condition
p(00|01) = 1. Analogous arguments can be found for the other vertices.

The observation that such extremal points of the polytope cannot be reached, provides us
with a way of writing down temporal inequalities able to discriminate between qubit and qutrit


machines. In fact, for each vertex we can write an expression in terms of probabilities that reaches
its algebraic maximum precisely on it. Namely, we can write

By := p(00|00) + p(00|11) + p(01|01) + p(01)10),
By := p(01|00) + p(01|11) + p(00|01) + p(00)10),

(5.15)
B3 := p(01|00) + p(00|11) + p(01\01) + p(01|10)
and Bg := p(01|00) + p(01/11) + p(01|01) + p(00|10).
One can, then, derive bounds for such expression in the case of qubit machines
Bi <3, Bo <3, B3 53.186 and By <3.186. (5.16)

So far, no general method has been developed for calculating such bounds and the methods
