Mixtures $90 and $91 of Table X represent the first series and S 92 and 8 93 of the
same table the second. Of these S 93 is under suspicion owing to the occurrence of slight
“knock”. This in itselfis interesting, for here is a case in which the substitution of water

vapour for hydrogen in a hydrogen-nitrous oxide mixture scems to give rise to some
departure from the normal progressive combustion, despite the fact that the lower
initial pressure and explosion temperature of $93 (Table X) compared with S82
(Table IX) should have the reverse effect. As to the results obtained from these series, the simultaneous solution of the heat
capacity equations for $79 (Table IX) and $90 and 92 (Table X) gives the following
values of the mean molecular heats over the temperature range 373-2759" C (abs.):
Cy, = 5-93, Cyo = 9-40 and Cy, = 6-32. The value of Cy, is considerably higher
than that obtained from the curve of fig. 13, namely 6-25, and as gradient corrections
have not been computed for the mixtures under consideration it is not possible to say
how much of the discrepancy is attributable to this.
