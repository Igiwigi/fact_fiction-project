oxygen gas and 10g of nitrogen. "The oxygen in 38 mea-
Sures of nitrous oxide will, therefore, be 19,7, to which, when
the oxygen spent in burning the residuum ( viz. 8 m. is added,
we obtain 27,7 for the total oxygen consumed ; and multiply-
ing by 2, we have 55,4 for the hydrogen saturated. From
the residuary nitrogen (59) deduct 39g measures arising from
the decompoxition of the nitrous oxide + 2 m., mingled with
it as an impurity = 441, and the remainder, 18 measures, is the
nitrogen resulting from the volatile alkali; and as 41 mea-
sures of ammonia give 55,4 + 18 = 73,4, measures of per-
manent gas, 100 would give 179 measures, in which the hy-
drogen and nitrogen would exist in the proportion of 75,4 to
24,6. From the same facts it may be deduced, that 190
measures of ammonia require for saturation 130 of nitrous
oxide = 674 oxygen gas. The coincidence then, between
the results of the combustion of ammonia with nitrous oxide,
and those with oxygen gas, confirms the accuracy of both
methods of analysis.

N1TRous 645, which, it appears from your testimony,* does
not compose an inflammable mixture with hydrogen, (nor asI
am assured by Mr. DaLTox, with any of the varieties of car-
buretted hydrogen) may be employed, I find, for the combus-
tion of ammonia. The proportions required for mutual satur-
ation are about 120 measures of nitrous gas to 100 of am-
