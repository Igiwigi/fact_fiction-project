Except for their generally somewhat
larger diameter—a difference which in any case is neither large nor constant—they do
not show the least difference, either in general appearance, mode of pitting or staining
properties, from the sieve-tubes of the outer phloem. Longitudinal microtome sections
treated with gentian violet and orange G showed in both cases exactly the same kind of
light-coloured granular patches (either left unstained or stained orange) in the apparently
lignified walls, which took up the violet stain. As this is a point of fact on which my conclusion was opposed to that arrived at by
previous workers, I was at first inclined to hesitate in making a definite statement. But
after carefully re-examining my earlier sections and also a dozen more paraffin series,
stained in a similar way, I am able to say with confidence that my interpretation is
correct; in addition to the outer phloem, undoubted sieve-tubes are present both
internally to the xylem cylinder and occupying the “ rays ” between the xylem bundles. Moreover, in all my series of longitudinal sections, wherever medullary strands are
present, sieve-tubes are seen in close association with them.
