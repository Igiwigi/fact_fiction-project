The saturation of the detectors generally happens much before the power limitation
of the laser source kicks in. Thus, the low probability of the post-seletction, the main negative
factor in experiments with anomalously large weak values, is not relevant. In fact, I also have
been involved in a weak value measurement experiment recycling photons which were not
post-selected [44], but the results only convinced me that it is an unnecessary complication of
the experiment. The argument made in my comment [42] was recently developed by Harris, Boyd and
Lundeen in Physical Review Letters: ‘Weak value amplification can outperform conventional :
measurement in the presence of detector saturation’ [45]. Ironically, their letter includes the [=
statement ‘saturation alone does not confer an advantage to the WVA’ which is technically valid 23
due to their assumption of a specific saturation model and unrealistic ideal noiseless situation.
