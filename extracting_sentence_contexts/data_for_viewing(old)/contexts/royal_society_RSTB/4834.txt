If this is the case, it is plain that these retia must in some way be of immense value
in the general life of the fish, for one cannot conceive that anatomical changes so extensive
and so profound could be brought about except for reasons of really fundamental
importance. What these reasons are and the precise way in which the retia are an aid
to the circulation are problems of some difficulty.

In the introduction to this paper it was pointed out that retia are found in a large
number of Vertebrates, but in view of the great diversity in the habits and zoological
position of the animals that possess them, there is no reason to assume that their action
is necessarily the same in all cases. Fishes, in which respiration is carried on by gills
and which in consequence have a mode of circulation essentially different from that of
an air-breathing animal, have problems to deal with of a nature other than those that
confront, for instance, an aquatic mammal, and although retia may, and in fact do,
occur in both it would be unwise to assume that their action in the two cases is necessarily
the same.

It seems therefore to be justifiable in discussing the possible use of these organs in
Lamna to consider them without reference to other non-piscine retia and to be content
if a plausible explanation can be suggested of their function in this particular instance.

So far as I have been able to ascertain, little has been written recently on the action
of retia.

General opinion, founded chiefly on Mitierâ€™s suggestions (17, p. 277), assigns
to these structures a mechanical function causing by means of the obstruction they
