milarity of chemical character. That that, which may be supposed and expressed by the

80-called rational formula in reference to the internal constitution of compounds, does

not affect the atomic heat, becomes more probable from the fact that chemically similar,

and even isomorphous compounds, one of which contains an atomic group in the place .
of an individual atom in the other, exhibit dissimilar atomic heats. This is seen, for

instance, in comparing analogous chlorine and cyanogen compounds (Cy=CN); the

latter have far greater atomic heats. Thus the atomic heat
