that he recognised any other form of motion, or energy; than the
translatory motion, though this is sometimes spoken of as vibratory. In this matter
the priority in a wider view rests with CLAUSIUS. According to WATERSTON the
ratio of specific heats should be (as for mercury vapour) 1°67 in all cases. Again,
although he was well aware that the molecular velocity cannot be constant, there
is no anticipation of the law of distribution of velocities established by MaxwELt.

A large part of the paper deals with chemistry, and shows that his views upon
that subject also were much in advance of those generally held at the time. :

The following extract from a letter by Professor McLEop will put the reader into
possession of the main facts of the case :—

“Tt seems a misfortune that the paper was not printed when it was written, for it
shadows forth many of the ideas of modern chemistry which have been adopted since
1845, and it might have been the means of hastening their reception by chemists.

“The author compares the masses of equal volumes of gaseous and volatile elements
and compounds, and taking the mass of a unit volume of hydrogen as unity, he
regards the masses of the same volume of other volatile bodies as representing their
molecular weight, and in the case of the elements he employs their symbols to indicate
the molecules.

“In water he considers that the molecule of hydrogen is combined with half a
