It is not necessary to go further back ft
definite views on the subject than to the time of Boyix,{ who thought that “even sue
(bodies) as are solid may respectively have their little atmospheres,” . . . “for”
he adds, “ no man, I think, has yet tried whether glass, and even gold, may not in
length of time lose their weight.” t
Boyr's opinion was correct, for mercury which has been frozen by extreme cold
does, as Mercet§ showed two centuries later, evaporate into the atmosphere surround~
ing it ; a fact which is of much interest in connection with Gay Lussac’s well-known
observation that the vapours emitted by ice and by water both at 0°C. are of equal
tension, Drmargay|| has proved that in vacuo metals evaporate sensibly at lower:
temperatures than they do at the ordinary atmospheric pressure, and he suggests
that even metals of the platinum group will be found to be volatile at comparatively
low temperatures. Thus he finds that cadmium volatilizes at 160°, zine at 184°, and lead and tin at
860°, and subsequently Sprine% (1894) demonstrated that zine is volatile at atmos-
pheric pressure at about 300°, cadmium at about 400°, while even copper is slightly
volatile at the latter temperature, f
Morssan** has stated quite recently that the vapour tension of solid silicon enables
it to unite with iron and chromium by true “cementation” at a temperature of 1200°,
which is much below the fusing point of these metals. It must be borne in mind that the interesting facts recorded by the various expetin
menters whose names I have cited hardly come within the prevailing conditions in
