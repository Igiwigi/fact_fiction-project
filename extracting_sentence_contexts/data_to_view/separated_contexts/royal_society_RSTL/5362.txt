In propoſing} this. as the probable uſe of Gangli-
ons, Lam far from thinking it entirely exempt from
difficulties; but they are chiefly ſuch, as ariſe from
our imperfe&t knowledge of the nerves in general;
a terra incognita, which remains to immortalize the
name of ſome future diſcoverer in anatomy. It is
well known, for inſtance, that all the nerves ſent from
the ſpinal marrow have Ganglions, where they ſend
off the branch, which communicates with the inter-
coſtals (4). Though this be true, it is moſt probable, that
theſe Ganglions reſpect the intercoſtals, and only affect
its nerves, leaving the other fibres fit and free for the
conveyance of the commands of the will, as in fact
many of them are diſtributed to muſcles under its
power and direction,

So likewiſe we are not to imagine, wherever the
nerves unite, that their medullary ſubſtance cither de-
cuſſates, or is ſo intimately mixed, as is reaſonably ſup-
poſed to be the caſe in Ganglions by moſt anatomiſts
from Lancifi down to Haller. - We know at leaſt,
that this is far from being the caſe in the optic nerves;
for though they unite, and were ſuppoſed to croſs
each other, the contrary appears by obſervations made
in the bodies of perſons, who were blind of one eye,
from a fault in the optic nerve, the nerve of the
affe&ed ſide only being waſted, while the other was
large and plump (7). And we may juſtly infer the

plexiform unions of the nerves diſtributed to the ſu-
perior extremities not more intimate, nor to ſerve any

equally motory and ſenſory, no other nerves being
diſtributed to the ſkin, . the organ of touch, but
