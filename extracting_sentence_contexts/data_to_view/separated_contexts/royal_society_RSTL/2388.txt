The theory of definite electrolytical or electro-chemical action appears to me
to touch immediately upon the absolute quantity of electricity or electric power be-
longing to different bodies. It is impossible, perhaps, to speak on this point without
committing oneself beyond what present facts will sustain ; and yet it is equally im-
possible, and perhaps would be impolitic, not to reason upon the subject. Although we
know nothing of what an atom is, yet we cannot resist forming some idea of a small
particle, which represents it to the mind ; and though we are in equal, if not greater,
ignorance of electricity, 80 as to be unable to say whether it is a particular matter or
matters, or mere motion of ordinary matter, or some third kind of power or agent, yet
there is an immensity of facts which justify us in believing that the atoms of matter
are in some way endowed or ass0ciated with electrical powers, to which they owe their
most striking qualities, and amongst them their mutual chemical affinity. As 800n
as we perceive, through the teaching of Darrox, that chemical powers are, however
yaried the circumstances in which they are exerted, definite for each body, we learn
to estimate the relative degree of force which resides in such bodies: and when upon
that knowledge comes the fact, that the electricity, which we appear to be capa-
ble of loosening from its habitation for a while, and conveying from place to place,
whilst it retains its chemical force, can be measured out, and, being s0 measured, is
found to be as definite in its action as any of those portions which, remaining associated
with the particles of matter, give them their chemical relation ; we seem to have found
the link which connects the proportion of that we haye eyolved to the proportion of
that belonging to the particles in their natural state.

853, Now it is wonderful to observe how small a quantity of a compound body is
decomposed by a certain portion of electricity. Let us, for instance, consider this and
a few other points in relation to water.
