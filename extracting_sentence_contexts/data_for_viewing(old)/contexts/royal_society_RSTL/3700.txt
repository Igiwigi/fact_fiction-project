portance of endeavouring to account satisfactorily for the discrepancy brought to
light by the Indian Survey; and that, not by merely putting it down to mountain
attraction, but by calculating that attraction by some independent means, with a view
to ee whether its amount actually corresponds with the observed anomaly*.

10. To dissect and actually to calculate the attraction of the masses of which
the Himalayas, and the regions heyond, are composed, appears, at the very
thought of it, to be an herculean undertaking next to impossible. I am fully con-
vinced, however, that no other method will succeed. It is upon this plan that the
solution of the problem is conducted in this paper. It will be seen, that by selecting
a peculiar law of dissection the calculation is very greatly simplified, and made to
depend entirely and solely upon a knowledge of the elevations and depressions, in
fact, the general contour of the surface. This information for some part of the mass
is already supplied by the maps of the Trigonometrical Survey.

11. In the following pages I propose, in the first place, to develope my method of
calculation, and to deduce a formula by which the attraction can be determined with
a precision corresponding to the degree of accuracy to which the contour of the
surface is known,

will be to diminish it by = nearly, or by nearly th part of its whole value,

* If the effect of mountain attraction upon the northern division of the are be what I make it, 15885, then
the ellipticity as determined from this and the Russian arc would be too small by z e, if mountain attraction is
neglected. The error in the ellipticity in comparing the whole arc between Kaliana and Damargida with the
