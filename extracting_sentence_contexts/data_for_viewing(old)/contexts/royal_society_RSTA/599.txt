Wachtershauser [2, p. 492] claimed instead that ‘information is a teleological concept’, and [Ss
gave a specific example of the conflict between chemistry and teleology: ‘On the level of nucleic 8

acid sequences it is convenient to use the information metaphor ... and apply teleological
notions such as “function” or “information” ... but in the course of the process of retrodiction
the teleological notions, whence we started, fade away. And what remains is purely chemical
mechanism’. This amounts to saying that biological information, the most basic concept of
molecular biology, does not really belong to science.

This is the ontological claim of the chemical paradigm, the idea that all natural processes are
completely described, in principle, by physical quantities. This view is also known as physicalism,
and it is based on the fact that biological information is not a physical quantity. So, what is it?
A similar problem arises with the rules of the genetic code: they cannot be measured and cannot
be reduced to physical quantities, so what are they?

According to physicalism, biological information and the genetic code are mere metaphors.
They are like those computer programs that allow us to write our instructions in English, thus
saving us the trouble of writing them in the binary digits of the machine language. Ultimately,
however, there are only binary digits in the machine language of the computer, and in the same
way, it is argued, there are only physical quantities at the most fundamental level of Nature.

This conclusion, known as the physicalist thesis, has been proposed in various ways by a
number of scientists and philosophers [8-14] and is equivalent to the thesis that ‘life is chemistry’.
