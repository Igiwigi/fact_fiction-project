to, an epithelial vesicle, quite separated from the allantoic canal (v. his Taf. I, Abb. 1,
and Taf. II, Abb. 2) and possessing a canal-like prolongation directed towards the free
end of the latter. He regarded this structure as an “ Amniongang ” (pp. 181-182). Now
if we compare the terminal vesicle (fig. 28, Plate 32) of our specimen with the structure
in question in SreRNBERG's embryo (STERNBERG, 1927, fig. 35, p. 181), there seems to
be no essential difference between them, and if we compare figs. 34 and 33 in STERN-
BeRG’s paper with fig. 10, Plate II, in Fiorran’s paper (1930, a), the only obvious
difference is in the size of the lumen. We are, therefore, convinced that the ‘* Amnion-
gang” in SrERNBERG’s specimen represents the detached vesicular end of the allantoic
canal. STERNBERG, it is of interest to note, describes the tubular part of the supposed

“ Amniongang ” as showing signs of degeneration. Our suggestion is supported not
only by the fact that Srernpere did not find an “ Amnionnabel ” (p. 182), but also
by Srreerer’s (1919) observations on the Mateer-embryo, where he describes the

“ allantois” as separated into two parts. They are so close to each other that there
can be no doubt that they are parts of one and the same formation (STREETER, 1919,
Plate I, fig. 6 ; text-figs. 1-2 (sections 58-79) and text-fig. 3), but in the Mateer-embryo
the separated distal part of the allantoic canal is not enlarged. We accordingly regard
the conditions in the Mateer-embryo as transitional between those seen in our embryo
and in STERNBERG’s specimen.
