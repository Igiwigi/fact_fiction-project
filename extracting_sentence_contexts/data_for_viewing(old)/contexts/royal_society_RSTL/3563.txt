meter of a muscular fibre from a foetus towards, or at the close of intra-uterine life,
is considerably less than the diameter of a fibre at a much earlier period.

As the fibre acquires its more perfect characters, s0 its substance becomes con-
densed: it diminishes in size. This is continually counteracted to some extent by
the addition of fresh material and nuclei ; but notwithstanding this, the size of the
fibre continues for a time to decrease, s0 that the diameter of a muscular fibre at birth
is considerably less than it was during a much earlier period of its existence *.

That this decrease in the size of the fibre is due to a condensation of its s1bstance,
and not to stretching or any like cause, seems proved, —l1st, by the relative position
of the nuclei, for the decrease in breadth is not accompanied by a corresponding sepa-
ration of the nuclei ; and 2ndly, by the fact, that as the fibre decreases it becomes
much less transparent. The nuclei in its interior grow much more obscure, and they
are at length concealed by the increasing density of the muscular substance.

At the time of birth muscuJar fibres present considerable variety in size and other
characters. The great majority measure in the pig from 757th to 575;gth of an inch
in width, but many will be fouad beyond either of these extremes. The striz are
very plainly marked, and in many almost as Jarge as in the adult fibre; in some,
however, they are much finer. In most of the fibres the nuclei in their interior are
obscured or quite hidden by the density of their snbstance, but in others they are till
