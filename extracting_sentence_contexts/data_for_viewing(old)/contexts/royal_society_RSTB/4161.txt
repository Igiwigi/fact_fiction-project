our Kerimba Archipelago specimens, especially in the tow-nettings of July 27, 1875,
made in Honolulu Harbour, where a clear and empty “ float-chamber” is rather an
exception. I have had no opportunity like Sir Joun Murray of examining these
organisms when freshly caught, but I have little doubt that the ‘“ monadiform
bodies” described by him were expressed from the outer periphery, i.e. from the
space between the float-chamber and the balloon-chamber, and that the coloured
granules observed in the float-chambers of the specimens to which reference has
been made are microscopic algze (Xanthelle), In several specimens after the
removal of the balloon-chamber (fig. 42) the inner surface of the very hyaline
float-chamber has been seen to be dotted with minute black or brown specks, which
we at first thought might be the dried remains of Sir Jonny Murray's monadiform
bodies, but on reflection it seems almost certain that these minute bodies are the
desiccated Xanthelle, These views are supported by the fact that these Xanthelle,
which are surface organisms, have been observed in other pelagic forms, and notably
in Globigerina.*

We have never observed any traces of protoplasm in the float-chamber, but the
space between it and the inner surface of the balloon-chamber is frequently filled

1 Goks, following Brapy no doubt, considered C. bulloides to be merely a modified Discorbina
(G. 1882, R.R.C.S., p. 106, Plate 8, figs. 262-3, and G. 1896, F.A., p. 70). I do not propose in this
paper to offer any observations upon C. poeyi (d’Orbigny). It is a highly variable species and in many
cases is undoubtedly merely C. bulloides (typical, or var. C. milletti) before it has acquired the balloon or
after it has lost it. Among Sir Joun Murray’s specimens from Honolulu (July 27, 1875) there are many
individuals, the initial portions of which, as seen through the “ balloon,” are typically C. poeyi of the most
