example, @;; = — @22, and we remember that p/o = A/v.

We search for a linear combination

2 = Es, + MiWs + aa Naas cs ee ee ee eee

where the w, are periodic functions of ¢ (parameter c), such that

dz

ae 11.5
a (11.5)
where p. is a constant at present undetermined, and is in fact an exponent of the periodic

solution (11.1). It is easily shown that the ~, must satisfy the equations

dw,

ae = Wy (te — P — Gy) — Walla, — Welly, — Wally

dw

rs = — Wily, + Wy (U + P — Gaz) — Waltz, — Walaa
