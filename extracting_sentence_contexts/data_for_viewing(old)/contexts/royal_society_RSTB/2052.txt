or genus.

Before giving the details of my results in a tabular form, I may say in general that
they were in all cases positive. The nitragin supplying the organisms from Piswm
and Vicia was apparently identical in action, and the latter, when applied to seeds of
Lathyrus aphaca, produced a considerable increase in the number of positive results
as compared with plants which had not been thus treated.

A similar increase resulted from the use of the nitragin supplied for Onobrychis
and Lupinus upon seeds of Vicia hirsuta.

The occurrence, in this series (e.g., last column of series i.), of tubercles upon
plants, cultivated as controls in soils which had been heated, illustrates a fact pointed

out by Ricwrer (41) in 1896, viz., the extreme difficulty of keeping soil or sand
sterile for many weeks in succession. Indeed, it has been often remarked that the
organisms concerned in the formation of Leguminous nodules seem to be as ubiquitous,
and consequently as difficult to remove as those of putrefaction and fermentation.

So far as I have tested the value of the inoculating material for Lupinus upon the
Lupin seed, the results lead one to infer that it is comparatively small. This may,
however, depend largely upon the composition of the culture medium, and I hope in
