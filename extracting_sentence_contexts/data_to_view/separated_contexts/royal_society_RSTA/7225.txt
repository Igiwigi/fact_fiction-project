Unfortunately, however, the thorium X preparation affected the enzyme chemically as
well as through its radiations and the method was abandoned after a few experiments. These, however, were of value as showing that inactivation of enzyme was, in fact, brought
about by a-radiation, though with low ionic efficiency. The experiments are described in
the appendix. Reverting to radon as the parent a-ray source, an attempt was made to remove the glass
splinters (the active deposit on which contributes a considerable portion of the f-ray dose)
from the main solution by using a bottle with a long ‘tail’ (figure 1a) into which the
