Most importantly, the outstanding progress achieved by the AGT method during the last few
years is well illustrated by the visual comparison of the uncertainty of the WG4 interpolation
(shaded area in figure 4) with the much smaller uncertainty associated with the dense NPL
dataset. By separating the contributions to the overall uncertainty of (T — Tog) of [47], it is evident
that the uncertainty associated with the acoustic determination of T is significantly smaller
than the total uncertainty which can be achieved in the realization of ITS-90 using standard
platinum resistance thermometers [55]. In fact, the unprecedented precision and accuracy of NPL
thermometry reveals some subtle features of the differences (T — Tog), previously unnoticed, and
whose origin is likely to be inherent in the reference function of the ITS-90. Moreover, analysis
of NPL data close to Trpw sheds new light on the previously discussed [56] discontinuity of the


slope d(T — To9)/dTo9. Estimating the slope d(T — T99)/dT99 above Typw from (T — Tog) at the Lo |
gallium point gives a good estimate of the slope just above Ttpw.
