Let A,(L) <A2(L) <---<4m(L) <0 denote the non-positive eigenvalues of the
operator H_. As the essential spectrum of Hy, is strictly positive, the eigenvalues behave as the
eigenvalues of a continuous family of finite-dimensional operators parametrized by L (e.g. [29,
§II.5]). A complete proof of this fact is given in [31]. We claim that each A;(L) is a strictly decreasing function of L. Applying theorem 3.1(iii) to the
operator Hy — A;(L), we see that |A3,1| > j.
