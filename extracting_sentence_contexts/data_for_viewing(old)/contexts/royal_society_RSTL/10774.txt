Fiiokness could be detected. We, therefore, gave one of the films a start by thicken-
Tg the others some time after their firs formation, and then compared them when
mother considerable interval of time had elapsed.
S This method is attended with several difficulties. In the first, place, the operation
Sikes a long time, during which slow changes in the zero error take place. Thus, if
He two films are firs compared when both have been recently flooded, and afterwards
hen one is black and the other coloured, a slight difference in the position of equili-
Erium may be observed, due to changes in the liquid rings, &. On some occasions,
Shen one of the films has been entirely black, the lower liquid ring has disappeared.
Fhis phenomenon is accompanied by a slight ehift in the position of equilibrium,
in, if the starb is too short the films are too similar to make the comparison of
Such use ; if it is too long the thin film is apt to break before the thick one is ready
&r observation. These difficulties are increased by the fact that it is nob safe to
Eave the films in communication while one of them is being thickened. A black film
almosb certain to break if subject to a disturbance which may alter its diameter by
Me or two millimetres. Tt is, therefore, necessary to separate the films while the
Biickening takes place, and nob to pub them again into communication until after the
fiteryal which experience has proved to be snflicient to prevent any greab change in
Siameter, We have attempted as far as possible to overcome these difficulties, and
have carried out our observations in two different ways.

HVirst Method of Experiment.

The fact that the method of measuring three ordinates confirmed that based upon
the meagurement of the principal diameters only, in indicating a small difterence of
