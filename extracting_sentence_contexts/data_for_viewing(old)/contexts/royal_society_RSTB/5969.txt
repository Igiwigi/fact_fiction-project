Isolated Seeds, figs. 67, 68, Plate 24, and fig. 33.

A number of isolated seeds are found in the same bed as the specimens just
described. They may be regarded as belonging to the Corystospermacee owing to
their similarity in form with attached seeds, and especially in their curved bifid micro-
pylar tubes. It seems certain that in our collection we have the seeds of several species,
for while there is a considerable general similarity, differences in size, shape, in surface
appearance, and in the form of the micropyle may be noticed. Fig. 33 shows a series
of these seeds drawn to the same scale. They vary from 3-5 to 7 mm. in length, and
from 2-2 to 5 mm. in breadth. We have no certain indications of their original form,
but they may have been flattened or platyspermic owing to the fact that almost
all the specimens when found show the curvature of the micropyle; had they been
symmetrical ellipsoids or pear-shaped we should have expected that in a large
percentage of specimens the bifid micropyle would be found projecting upwards or
downwards into the matrix as in fig. 33 (g), where the micropyle has been broken away.
In this specimen, which was transferred from the matrix, a prominent ridge is seen
running down one surface of the seed, and in another example a similar ridge is seen
in a central position, suggesting that this form may have been more or less triangular
in section.
