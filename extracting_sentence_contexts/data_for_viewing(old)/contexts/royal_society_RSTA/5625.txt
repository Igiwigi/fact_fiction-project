scales, manifestly becoming independent of v, as v + 0 [1-3]. This property, also known as
dissipative anomaly, is the central tenet of essentially all turbulence theories and models [1].
However, the fluctuations of dissipation rate (and hence that of strain rate) can be orders of
magnitude larger than its mean [4,5], a phenomena known as intermittency, which renders
any mean-field description of turbulence inadequate [1,6]. Understanding the formation of such
intense fluctuations and characterizing their statistical properties has long remained one of the
outstanding challenges in turbulence [1,7].

Understanding the intense fluctuations of dissipation is also directly important from a practical
standpoint. For instance, strong strain rates can greatly enhance dispersion of particles and
influence mixing of scalars or can adversely affect flame propagation in reacting flows [8-11].
Intense strain also leads to generation of intense vorticity, via the well-known vortex stretching
mechanism [12], which in turn influences clustering of inertial particles [13]. In fact, strain and
vorticity are not independent and their coupling implicitly encodes all the multiscale interactions
in the flow [14,15]. While much attention has been recently given to understand this interaction in
the light of vorticity amplification [15-17] and energy cascade across scales [18,19], in the current
work, we present a complementary investigation focusing on amplification of strain (and hence
dissipation rate).

The key mechanisms controlling amplification of strain can be readily identified by writing its
transport equation (as derived from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations):
