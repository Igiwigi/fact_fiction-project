Its derivative
along the dimension r leads to, F = 0U/dr or 0V/dr, where V is the electric potential. The force
exerted by the electric field E on another charge q generates a momentum p which can be
expressed as F = qE= dP/dt. The expression defined by equation (4.1) expresses the fact that a
charged particle in an electromagnetic field shows rotational motion and the radiation generated
by it is not linearly but circularly polarized. The equations discussed earlier can also be expressed using the electromagnetic field tensor
[32], Fuv = 9A,/dx, — 0A,,/dx, where A is magnetic vector potential, x is a dimension in space, ju
and v are subscripts denoting spatial components. The symmetry breaking of the electromagnetic
field tensor can be expressed as 0F,»/0x =J,, , where J,, is the four current vector.
