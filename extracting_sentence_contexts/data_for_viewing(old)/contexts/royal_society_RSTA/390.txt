scientific uncertainty or errors

maladaptive reinterpreting the threat by making its scale seem smaller or its timeframe
coping distant, people ‘de-problematize’ the threat
strategies diversionary strategies appropriate thoughts and actions are displaced by
positive but trivial actions (such as installing
low-energy light bulbs) or by pleasure-seeking
blame-shifting responsibility is disavowed by blaming others for the
problem. For example, China has become a popular
scapegoat for global warming
indifference strategies deliberate apathy can reduce short-term pressures but
may exact a heavy psychological toll
‘benign fictions’ lead us to predict what we would
optimism/wishful prefer to see. Such unrealistic optimism becomes
thinking maladaptive when healthy illusions refuse to
respond to external evidence and become delusions

unrealist:

adaptive expressing and feelings of anger, despair and hopelessness are natural
coping controlling emotions in the circumstances. Emotion-focused coping
strategies requires that we express these feelings but do not
become ‘stuck’ in them
problem-solving finding out more about a threat may alleviate anxicty.
