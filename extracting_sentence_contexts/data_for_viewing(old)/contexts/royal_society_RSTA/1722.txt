Equation (4.13) can be reformulated as the DBVP. In fact, it suffices to take Ep = &, 2 =D(Qm),
and G=4p. Thus the neutral equation is equivalent to a Cauchy problem of the form (3.2).
On the other hand, proposition 4.2 shows that hypothesis of theorem 3.2 are satisfied. Hence,
equation (4.13) is well-posed and solved by strongly continuous semigroup (T_,k(f))>0 on the
product space

X=Xx Ep.

We summarize all the above results in the following.

Theorem 4.6. The neutral equation (4.13) is well-posed and it is equivalent to the Cauchy problem (3.2)
governed by the operator cf,,x on X defined by (3.3) which generates a strongly continuous semigroup on
X. Moreover, if 1 € p(Ke* U(.,0)) then
