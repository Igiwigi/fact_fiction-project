The discovery of multiple examples of this
phenomenon gave rise to a new field: sociomicrobiology
(reviewed in [75]; a less technical exploration of sociomicro-
biology is included in [76, pp. 156-161]). This discipline
was created in great part in response to the recognition of
the phenomenon of quorum sensing, which describes bac-
terial communication phenomena that seem to be related to
the pathogenic nature of many bacterial species (reviewed
in [77,78]). This fact has many public health implications. Quorum sensing disruption is currently investigated as a
possible target to develop new classes of antibiotics [79,80]. Remarkably, recent developments indicate that bacterial com-
munities rely on electrochemical processes for communication
purposes, just as nerve cells do [81-83].
