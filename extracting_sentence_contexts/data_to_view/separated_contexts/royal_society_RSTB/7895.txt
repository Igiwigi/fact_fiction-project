A seasonal influence may account for the fact of one
animal having experienced this wave of ovarian activity at an earlier stage of gestation
, than another, the difference being of the order of 2 months. It is probably significant that
both animals were killed during the time of year when mating is apparently most frequent,
L for the long gestation period, continuing through nearly 2 years, carries the animal through
the usual breeding season some time near the middle of pregnancy, and as E147 became
pregnant at a later date than did E138, any response of its ovaries to a seasonal influence
would overtake it earlier in pregnancy. That these corpora lutea were in fact ‘active’ was
shown by the demonstration of the presence of progesterone in the preserved material. This was done by Mr D. G.
