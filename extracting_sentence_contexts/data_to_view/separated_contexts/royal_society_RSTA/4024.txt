Landauerâ€™s principle states that certain classes of logical
operation require a minimum amount energy which is equivalent to kT.In(2). This type of logical
operation is termed irreversible, and is the basis of all computers in current existence. This
principle has long been accepted as fact, but was only recently demonstrated experimentally [14]. Much literature has been devoted to how computing devices might be constructed that do not
generate heat to the same degree as current machines; however, it is not clear that such devices
can be realized in practice. Thus, it is interesting to consider what this limit means in terms of current architectures.
