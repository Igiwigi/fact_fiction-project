the geoid, is expressible, at least roughly and approximately, by means of harmonics
of the first, second, and third degrees. Now, if the shape of the lithosphere is at all
close to that in which it may be presumed to have consolidated, the inference would
seem to be that, in respect of general features, as distinguished from local irregularities,
the positions of the continental blocks and oceanic regions have not changed much
since the date of consolidation. This view has in recent times met with considerable
support among geologists.
The theory also enables us to make some attempt to indicate the general nature
wor those changes which could be expected to take place. In estimating the value of
Such an attempt some allowance must be made for the fact that the theory of an
‘Plastic body in a state of initial stress is very far from complete. We try to follow
‘put certain clues drawn from the scanty knowledge we possess of bodies in states of
Binitial stress. Among these the behaviour of cast iron under tensile tests is perhaps
“mportant. It is well known that cast iron which has not previously been tested
exhibits a stress-strain curve which is essentially different from that of mild steel, but
that, after several tests, its behaviour approaches to that of steel. It has been
Gonjectured that the tests have the effect of gradually removing a state of initial
Stress, and thus reducing the substance to a “state of ease.” That state of a rotating
‘oravitating planet which would correspond to a state of ease in solid bodies at its
“Zsurface would seem to be a state in which the material would be arranged in
Peoncentric spheroidal layers of equal density, and the external surface would be an
Boblate spheroid, the ellipticity being determined by the speed of rotation and the
