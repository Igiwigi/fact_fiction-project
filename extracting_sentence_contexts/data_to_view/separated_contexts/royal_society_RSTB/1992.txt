The buds, which give rise to new bulbs, usually arise in the axils of the tunics, one
to each. Such are the general external features of a bulb, gathered from the examination of
nearly a thousand of them. Other details were noticed, such as the presence in a
few bulbs of an extra scale, suggestive of the vestige of a second tunic, also an occa-
sional one with the axis considerably lengthened between the scales and the new
bud, in fact, drop-bulbs. Histology of the Bulb.—Transverse and longitudinal sections of a bulb-scale reveal
the following characters (see fig. 4) :—

(1.) Two epidermal layers composed of small cells, elongated in a longitudinal
direction.
