tribe a resemblance in some respects to birds, in others to the
Amphibia; so that it may be considered as an intermediate link
between the classes Mammalia, Aves, and Amphibia ; and, al-

render that part of the chain more complete.

Between it and the bird, no link of importance seems to be
wanting.

The great affinity between the male organs of the Ornitho-
rhynchus and those of birds, is best illustrated by comparing the
