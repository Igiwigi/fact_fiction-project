To calculate these radii, we apply the selection criterion (4.18) twice, in each of these planes
(using the constant aspect ratio for ice crystals in the form of elliptical paraboloids [47]). As is
easily seen, the tip radii and growth rate have the same behaviour: pg and p2 decrease and V
increases with increasing AT. The slight discrepancy between theory and modelling for a larger
radius is explained by the fact that instead of the Ivantsov solutions for axisymmetric crystals, in
this case, it is necessary to use the Horveyâ€”Cahn solutions for non-axisymmetric ice crystals in
the form of elliptical paraboloids [35,38]. Figure 6 compares the present theory and computations carried out for nickel crystals with the
fourfold symmetry using the enthalpy-based method. Here, we compare the tip diameter p4 and
tip velocity V as functions of the melt undercooling AT for various forced flow velocities U, fixed
far from the growing dendrite.
