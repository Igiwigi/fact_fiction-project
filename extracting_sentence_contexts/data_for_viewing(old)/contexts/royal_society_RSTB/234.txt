the upper, and the lower limbs, respectively. It is, moreover, the area which inter-
venes between the presumably higher psychical centres of the prefrontal region and
the lower areas for the face and limbs; hence, it seems probable that impulses
proceeding from these higher centres will traverse the area for the head and eyes on
their way to the areas for the limbs.

(b.) Upper Limb.—We can, with advantage, add to what we said about the
movements of the upper limb in our former paper. Some of these movements we
have already discussed in considering the mode of the march (p. 237), but to these
considerations we would like to add one or two more of a wider nature. It is time’
to consider whether we cannot elucidate the fundamental principles which underlie
the development of the mechanism for the performance of so-called voluntary actions.
In the first place, we cannot pass by the obvious fact upon which we think we are
now entitled to speak with some degree of certainty, viz., the suggestive difference
between the functional activity of the ascending frontal and ascending parietal
portions of the upper limb area.

While at the upper part (especially anteriorly) of the ascending frontal portion we
find represented, as an initial movement, advancing of the whole limb with extension
