In his ‘Geodesy,’ Colonel CLARKE gives his latest determination of the figure of
the Earth, in which he employs 14 of the latitude stations and 6 of the longitudinal
ares of the Indian Surveys, in combination with 35 latitude stations of surveys made
in other parts of the world. No attempt will be made here to obtain a new value of
the figure of the Earth by employing the whole of the Indian data instead of the
small portion used by Colonel Cuarke. All that is now aimed at is to set forth the
facts to be elicited from the operations in India which will be most serviceable for
future mathematical investigations. The existing data may evidently be treated as they stand, in accordance with
either of the various methods which have been employed by Arry, Brssen, CLarke,
and others. But in all mathematical treatment of such data it is assumed that the
direction of the plumb-line at the astronomical stations is normal, or very closely
normal, to the surface, and wherever there is reason to suspect that this may not be
the case the station is arbitrarily rejected.
