(+15 m). This degree of accuracy requires that the ship’s speed be absolutely known to
within +5 % and relatively known to +3 %, while the figures for the firing depth should
be respectively +8°% and +5%%; these values assume that the time between the
dropping and firing of the charge can be measured with a much higher percentage
accuracy.

It was expected that the ship’s speed would be known with precision from the number
of revolutions per minute of the engine. This was not, however, the case, and it was found
that a better determination could be obtained by measurement of the distance moved
and the time between successive shots. The distance measurement was obtainable from
the time taken for the direct sound to reach the buoy hydrophones, while the time between
successive shots was measured from the chronometer. The main error in determining the
absolute value of the ship’s speed arose from the fact that there was a relative drift between
the buoys, but it is estimated that it does not exceed 5%. The timing between the charge
hitting the water and its explosion was obtained with a stop-watch to an accuracy of
about 0:5 %.

The ship’s internal geophone not only provided an indication on the recording when
the sound arrived at the ship, but also provided the times of various bottom and surface
reflexions. The paths by which these sound pulses arrived are as follows:

(a) The direct sound.

(6) The sound reflected once from the sea bed.
