With regard to the middle lamella there is some difficulty, unless very careful
preparation is adopted. It will in any case stain, the depth of the staining depending
upon the action of the acid and of the dye, and if the treatment with the one or with
the other be forced, the great coloration of the lamella will 80 obstruct the view that
it will be impossible to see with certainty whether or not a distinct continuity of
the protoplasmic processes occurs. The difficulty may, however, in a great measure
be removed by long treatment with strong glycerine, which both dissolves the greater
portion of the colouring matter from the lamella, and at the same time renders it
sufficiently transparent for a decisive observation to be made.

The bast fibres of Mimosa are of peculiar interes6 with regard to this question.
The middle lamellze between these cells are 80 little developed that they are re-
cognised with some difficulty, and which is an important fact, do not stain ab all.
Consequently, the additional factor of difficulty, that the presence of a well-developed
middle lamella involves, is here done away with. Each bast cell is freely pitted, the
pits of neighbouring cells being placed symmetrically opposite one another. When
treated with sulphuric acid and stained in the usual manner the following appearance
is produced. The pit membranes being 80mewhat thick have distinetly swollen, and
in 80 doing have increased the distance from one another of the ends of the proto-
plasmic processes projecting into the pit cavity. All the processes are deeply stained,
and between each symmetrically opposite pair is a small less stained portion tra-
versing the pit membrane, which from its reactions musb be protoplaxm. Thus it
stains with iodine, and when coloured with methyl violeb is not digsolved by
glycerine (Plate 68, fig. 6). It is also well brought out by HorMaNnN's blue, the
staining characters of which have already been sufficiently dwelb upon. That it is
