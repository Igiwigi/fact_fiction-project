X-ray source in a CT system, while the lower detectors detect the presence, absence and scattering
of the muons that were defined by the upper detectors. This is, in fact, very similar to a CT
system, but due to the angular distribution of cosmic muons and due to the geometric limits
imposed by the detector system only a narrow angular range around the vertical is covered. This
necessarily means that the resolution of such a muon tomography system in the horizontal plane
(in x and y) will be much better than the vertical resolution (along with the z-axis). The existing
muon tomography systems are static systems, i.e. they require that the object or sample is placed
inside their active volume. This active volume is most typically of the order of m3; the largest
one has an active volume of tens of m3. Typical examples of static muon tomography systems are
the system at INFN Padova [24] and the Lynkeos Muon Imaging System produced by Lynkeos
Technology Ltd. in Scotland [18]. The Los Alamos MMT [25] can also be transported in a trailer
for fieldwork (figure 6). The largest static system is the cargo container scanning system produced
by Decision Sciences in the USA.
