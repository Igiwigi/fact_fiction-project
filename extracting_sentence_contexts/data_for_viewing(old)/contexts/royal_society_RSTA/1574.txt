not only Gaussian white noise as in the previous studies but also Ornsteinâ€”Uhlenbeck coloured
noise could maximize periodic signal detection performance at the output of the FFL network
of FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons. In another work, Liu and Li considered more realistic
conditions such as utilization of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons interacting with glial cells [68].
It was observed that the SR performance of the FFL motifs can be significantly enhanced by
astrocytes, suggesting that this type of glial cells may act as a noise regulating mechanism for
SR with their stochastic calcium channel dynamics.

As for the VR studies, FFL motifs and similar ones have been preferred for simple clarification
of population behaviour in signal transmission. For example, Deng ef al. investigated the VR
phenomenon with bidirectionally coupled networks of three neurons [69]. The authors employed
networks of FHN neurons coupled with electrical gap junctions as well as with excitatory
chemical synapses. Considering the fact that the type of synaptic connection between neurons
significantly affects the network behaviour and the transmission of information, they analysed
weak signal detection performance by measuring the response of three coupled FHN neurons
to a subthreshold LF input, and compared effects of both coupling types on VR behaviour



in the presence of additive noise and noise-free cases under HF driving. It was demonstrated 8 |
that chemical synapses are more efficient in regards to VR performance than electrical ones, in

particular, if the coupled neurons have a high excitability level, and this is independent from the 3
local or global application of weak signal to the network. Lastly, it was reported that VR behaviour 1S
