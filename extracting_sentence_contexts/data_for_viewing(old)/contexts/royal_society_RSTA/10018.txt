The object of the experiments was the direct comparison of the spectrum of the
iron are when subjected to high pressures with the spectrum emitted under ordinary
conditions. To facilitate the examination of the relative positions of the lines in the
two cases it was desirable to photograph the two spectra in as close proximity as
possible, and for this purpose the usual form of comparison-shutter was adopted.
This caused the central strip of the plate to be exposed to the arc under pressure,
and above and below this strip the comparison spectrum to be photographed; or
vice versd. The shutter is described in Part L, p. 117. The dispersion of the second-
order spectrum (1 millim. = 1:3 A.U.) was employed in this research.

The following precautions were taken to insure the freedom of the photographs
from any fictitious displacement of the lines :â€”

1. To prevent jarring of the camera when the shutter was operated, the latter,
which was originally fixed to the camera box, was detached from it and separately
supported, as already described.

2. To make sure that the conditions were the same for the two different positions
of the shutter, some photographs were taken with the pressure spectrum within the
central strip and others with the comparison spectrum in the centre. No systematic
difference was found between the two.

3. To insure the absence of an apparent shift due to the illumination of the grating
being different for the two exposures, the arrangement of mirrors and lenses already
