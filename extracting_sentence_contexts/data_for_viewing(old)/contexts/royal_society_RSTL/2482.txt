materially from that of Cancer Pagurus, formerly figured in Zoological Researches

360 MR. THOMPSON ON THE DOUBLE METAMORPHOSIS

PI. vm. fig. 1. It is, however, certainly much smaller, and of a greenish tinge, with
a few darker spots.

If the above facts do not warrant the conclusion I have drawn, what other proof
can be required ? Is it necessary that the young Crab should be traced through its
subsequent changes until the character of the species becomes more apparent 2 or
that the grown Zoe should be actually seen to change into a Megalope? Neither of
these is impracticable, but may yet for a long time elude the most zealous and scru-
tinizing observers.

It appears, then, that the animals of this division of the Crustacea not only undergo
metamorphosis, as formerly tated, but that they even undergo a double metamor-
phosis, being hatched from the ova under the singular and grotesque form of Zoea,
then assume that of Megalopwe, and finally that of their parent Crab. How long they
remain in each of these two intermediate states it may be difficult to determine with
exactitude ; but judging from the very considerable size of the Zoe T observed about
