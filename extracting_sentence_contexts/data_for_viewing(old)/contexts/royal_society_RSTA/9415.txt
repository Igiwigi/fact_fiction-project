phase change in the lunar magnetic variation might be explained (a more aceurate
determination of the amplitude change would decide this point more definitely), but
in no circumstances could the whole of it be thus accounted for. Probably the
explanation which must be sought elsewhere will account for the whole of the
phenomenon under discussion.

Before leaving the consideration of the atmospheric tide, its actually observed
phase, as determined from forty years’ barometric observations at Batavia, may be
_ adverted to. The lunar diurnal variation of barometric pressure was found to be

0°0628 cos (2¢+65°),

t being reckoned from the local time of the moon’s transit. The fact that the tide is
in advance of the moon is difficult to understand, and it is conceivable that the
unknown cause which thus accelerates the tide also has some connection with the
perigee-apogee phase change in the lunar magnetic variations.

So far no real light on the origin of this phase change has been found, since theoretical
reasoning indicates no such change in the atmospheric tide which is supposed to
produce the lunar magnetic variations. Whether the phase of the tide does or
does not so change is, as already stated, unknown ; if it is found to vary correspondingly
with the magnetic variations, the tidal theory of the latter would be strengthened,
though the phase change in the tides themselves would offer *problem demanding
solution.” In the present state of ignorance, however, it is natural to consider
whether, if the phase of the atmospheric tide is independent of lunar distance, the
