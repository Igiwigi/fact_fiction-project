* In this specimen the anterior margin of the base
of the basi-occipital is very nearly conterminous with the posterior margin of the base
of the basisphenoid, and the lower surfaces of the two bones flow together in an almost
continuous curve, so that they have evidently not suffered from displacement, but
retain their original relations. With this fact established, the position we have assigned to the otic bones becomes
confirmed, and it is of great interest to observe how closely the whole structure of
this region of the skull corresponds with that in the Stegocephalian, Lyriocephalus

* Tt is interesting to find a similar character already in existence among the Stegocephalia, Thus, in
describing Loxomma—which, however, possesses only one occipital condyle—WATSON states that “the
back of the basi-sphenoid is recessed for the anterior end of the basi-occipital.” (D. M. 8.
