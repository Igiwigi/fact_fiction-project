The petrology, geochemistry and volcanic structure
of other systems in the NVZ and those of the Western Volcanic Zone (WVZ) and Reykjanes
Peninsula (REP) have also been the target of study [43-46]. The available observations indicate
that models of crustal magmatic plumbing for these systems (1-4, 8, 21, 22 from figure 2) have
much in common with Krafla and Theistareykir. This similarity may reflect the fact that the
crustal thicknesses and magmatic fluxes in these systems are equivalent. It may also be important
that these volcanic zones have been active for more than 5 Myr. By contrast, activity on the
Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ: systems 12-20) started relatively recently (3 Ma).
