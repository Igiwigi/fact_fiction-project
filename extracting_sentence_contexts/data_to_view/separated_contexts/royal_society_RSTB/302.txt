and IV. represent diphasic variations re-appearing as the negativity of B
declines. 1st phase, A negative (major phase).
2nd phase, B negative (minor phase). The facts of experiment are in complete agreement with this theoretical representa-
tion. With a normally beating heart in situ, led off from the apex to the mercury of
the electrometer, from the base to the sulphuric acid, the level of the mercury in
the capillary showed that apex and hase were iso-electric in the intervals between
the beats, each of which was accompanied by the double variation SN, signifying :â€”

1st phase, apex negative. 2nd phase, base negative.
