Mr. Seexce BartE also, in p. 55 of his very interesting © Report on the British Edrio-
phthalma ” to the British Association, 1855, observes,—< It is probable, that about the
middle of the period of incubation, the young animal quits the egg, for we have con-
stantly taken them from the pouch, bearing an embryonic character without being closed
in their egg-case. The larva at this period is very immature and covered in a general
tunic, which, apparently without having any absolute vital connexion with the animal
more than the original egg-case had with the embryo, adapts itself in form to the whole
creature, and fulfils the duty of a protective tissue.”

This remarkable fact has been already observed by the accurate STRAUSSF, who compares
it with the gestation of the marsupials. He says, however, © Dans cet 6tat, ils n'offrent
qu'une masse arrondie et informe, $7 laquelle on remarque, quand on Texamine de pres,
les rudiments obtus du bras ;” but here he is in error: the rudimental antennz are not, on
the spherical membrane enclosing the embryo, but are inside it, and are seen through it. Very similar also is the hatching of many Annelids, in which also the young animal quits
the egg, as an egg-shaped body without any external organs except cilia, by means of
which it swims with activity.
