beating againſt the ſhores of the continent and iſlands,
detach many mafſes, which are ſpread upon the bot-
tom of the ſea. The rivers carry the mud with their
waters into the ſea, at the bottom of which that mud
depoſits itſelf.

From the riſing of the bottom of the ſea, that of
the level of the water naturally follows. Dr. Do-
nati furniſhes us with a great number of facts in
proof of this. He obſerved, that at Venice, in Iftria,
and in Dalmatia, the level of the waters is ſeveral
feet higher than it was formerly. This elevation of
the waters is obſerved only on the northern and
eaſtern coaſts of the Adriatic. The ſea ſeems, on the
contrary, to abandon the weſtern coaſt, that of Italy.
This Dr. Donati has ſhewn by many very intereſting
facts.

He proceeds then to the obſervations, which he
made upon the plants, and animals of the Adriatic
Sea.
