Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, one can write (9142)e, < \/ (9{)e (q3)e, Which produces the infimum
for equation (5.2), as follows:

(Fh fa Oxon =f + Ed) +k sin? 64(0))ay + (2m — 2 hry/ (sin? O1(0))0 3 ia]: 63)

The next step is the actual act of averaging with respect to 02. The value of (sin? 6 (t))e, depends
on the order of 61/65. If |61| « 62|, then the coupling energy, as can already be learned from
equation (5.2), is of the order of O(k) (as h < 1). If one considers the critical case of delocalization
transition, then the coupling energy in the state assumed here to be that of localization becomes
Olkcr). As we will see in the following, and as one can guess, the coupling energy in the
beating or energy exchange regime is of the order of the total energy. This means that if indeed
\61| « 62|, then the coupling energy contains a significant portion of the total energy, which is
not appropriate for the IC of localization (this argumentation also assumes the trivial fact that
(4)e, = O(1), which is obvious for the normalized displacement square average of an impacting
mass).

The conclusion from this lengthy argumentation is that the assumption \61| < || is
contradictory for (the perfectly viable) ICs of localization. Consequently, it is either that |6,| =
O(|62|) or that |6;| >>> (in the initial localization regime). After that fact is established, one
observes that, for the case |61| < |6.l, clearly one has (sin? A1(t))e, = 3 Furthermore, as the
averaging with respect to @2 can always be done not on one but on several of the first fast (second
mass impact) cycles, clearly for the case \61| = (1621/2), one would also have (sin? A(6))e, = 3 A
typical example is |61| = |(62|/2), for which even for one cycle (sin? 6) ())a = 3 (due to the square).
If the ratio is slightly different, several cycles may be used for averaging. A problem would arise
only for a small value of the aforementioned ratio, because then too many cycles may be needed,
