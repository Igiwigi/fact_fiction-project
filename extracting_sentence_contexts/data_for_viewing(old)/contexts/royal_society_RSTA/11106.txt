of order 2m — 1.

The first theorem may be very simply proved.

§ 10. Suppose we are given, for example, that equality of contraries subsists for

frequencies of the fifth order; then we have
(ABCDE) = (aBy8e)
(ABCDe) = (aBySE)

(ABCD) = (aBy8)

and so on. The expansions of contrary frequencies are in fact necessarily contrary

or adding

themselves.

§ 11. Next for Theorem II. To take the simplest case, let us suppose equality of
contraries given for the second order frequencies. Take any third order group and
expand it in terms of its contrary and second order frequencies. This may be done
most elementarily step by step. Thus

(aBC) = (BC) — (ABC)
(aBC) = (aC) — (BC) + (ABC)
