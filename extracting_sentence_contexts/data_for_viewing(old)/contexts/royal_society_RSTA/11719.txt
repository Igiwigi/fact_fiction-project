The form of W’ shows that ¢,0, +¢6,+....+¢,0, is equal to the electric
polarization f, in the molecule on which the electric force P, acts. If unit volume of
the medium contains , molecules of one kind, v, of another and go on, and the
polarizations in each molecule are respectively f,, f and so on, then

SF =f > tyJo jae ae

25. To obtain the general equation of propagation in the ether, let JF denote the
electric force, or the torque acting on the ether; and we have, as in Part II. § 11,
the kinematic relation (47)~! cul 33 = d/dt (9 + B’) + G, and also the dynamical
equation — d33/dt = curl SF where 47c°?9= JF. It is to be observed that this
dynamical equation leaves out the purely local part of the electric force. The
propagation of radiation of ordinary wave-length is in fact an action involving the
medium in bulk, and not one of molecular type; thus in accordance with the
Younc-Poisson principle (infra § 47) the local part of the electric force, arising from
the surrounding molecules, is compensated intermolecularly by an influence on the
physical properties of the material medium which thereby become functions of the
density and strain, and this part therefore does not enter into the molar electric
forcive maintaining the radiation. These equations lead to

CVD = 2/d? (B+ D’) + de dt.

Hence, when the current of conduction @ is non-existent, K’ = 1 + 33//39; whilst
here 3’ is f’, and 470°9D, or P, is P, — Ac?f’; so that (K’ — 1)/(K’ — 1 +4 4z/d)
= de*. f’/ P,, or taking \ equal to $7, we have (K’ — 1)/(K' + 2) = $7c?. /’/P).
