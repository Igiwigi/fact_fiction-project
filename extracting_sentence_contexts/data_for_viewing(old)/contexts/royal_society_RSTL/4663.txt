also; but there is this difference, that the latter salt will not advance $0 far in its
progression, owing to its smaller diffusibility, in the seven days of the experiment, as
the more diffusible nitrate does. The diffusion of the carbonate will thus be given

in excess, and as it is the smaller diffusion, the difference of the diffusion of the two
salts will not be fully brought out.

The only way in which the comparison of the two salts can be made with perfect
fairness, is to allow the diffusion of the slower salt to proceed for a longer time, till
in fact the quantity diffused is the same for this as for the other salt, and the same
point in the progression has therefore been obtained in both; and to note the time
required. The problem takes the form of determining the times of equal diffusion of
the two salts. This procedure is the more necessary from the inapplicability of cal-
culation to the diffusion progression.

Further, allowing the Times of Equal Diffusion to be found, it is not to be expected
that they will present a simple relation. Recurring to the analogy of gaseous diffu-
Sion, the times in which equal volumes or equal weights of two gases diffuse are as
the square roots of the densities of the gases. The times, for instance, in which equal
quantities of oxygen and hydrogen escape out of a vessel into the air, in similar
cireumstances, are as 4 to 1; the densities of these two gases as 16 to 1. Or, the
times of equal diffusion of oxygen and protocarburetted hydrogen are as 1-4142 to 1,
