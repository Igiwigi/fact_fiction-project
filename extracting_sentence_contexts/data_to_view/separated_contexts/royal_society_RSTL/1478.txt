These results and calculations agree with those that I have
before given, and with those of Dr. Hensy. The lately discovered facts in chemistry, concerning: the
important modifications which bodies may undergo by very
Slight additions or subtractions of new matter, ought to ren-
der us cautious in deciding upon the nature of the process of
the electrical decomposition of ammonia.

* 100 of ammonia at the rate of 185, will give 136.9 of hydrogene, weighing 3.1
grains, and 48.1 of nitrogene weighing 14.33 grains ; but 18.4 — 17.4 = 1, and at
the rate of 180, 133 of hydrogene weighing 3.01 and 47 of nitrogene, weighing we
and 18,4 — 17 = 1:4.

It isposs:ble, that the minute quantity of oxygene which ap-
pears: to be separated is not accidental, but a result of the
decomposition ; and if hydrogene and nitrogene be both
oxides of the same basis, the possibility of the production of
different proportions of water, in different operations, might
account for the variations observed in some cases in their re-
lative proportions ; but on the whole, the idea that ammonia is
decomposed into hydrogene and nitrogene alone, by electricity,
and that the loss of weight, is no more than is to be expected
in processes of 80 delicate a kind, is in my opinion, the most
defensible view of the subject. But if ammonia be eapable of decomposition into nitrogene
and hydrogene, what, it will be asked, is the nature of the
matter existing in the amalgam of ammonia? what is the
metallic basis 'of the volatile alkali? These are questions,
intimately connected with the whole of the arrangements of
chemistry ; and they are questions, which, as our instru-
ments of experiment now exist, it will not, I fear, be easy to
solve.
