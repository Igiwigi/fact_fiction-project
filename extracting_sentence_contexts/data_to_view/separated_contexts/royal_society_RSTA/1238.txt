A
secondary ionospheric peak forms in the lower thermosphere and upper stratosphere, populated
by hydrocarbon ions (figure 7). Ablated refractory debris from micrometeoroids could deliver
metal vapours [174], whose long-lived atomic ions could potentially replace hydrocarbon ions
in this secondary peak [191]. In fact, Lyons [191] suggests that sharp electron-density layering
in the lower ionosphere of Neptune and the other giant planets, as seen from the Voyager radio
occultation experiment, could be caused by Mg* or other long-lived ions being compressed by
horizontal winds with vertical shears (e.g. gravity waves) acting in the presence of the planet's
magnetic field (see also [200,201]). Of all the ionic species predicted to be present on the Ice Giants, only Hj has been detected,
and only on Uranus [37,69,71,72,76,199,202-204]. Observations of Hy have provided a useful
probe of thermospheric conditions on Uranus.
