exceptional size tends to unduly increase the values of the columns in which the

figures belonging to the epidemics appear. Large amplitudes may thus be observed

236 DR. J. BROWNLEE: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PERIODICITY OF

corresponding to periods the existence of which is open to legitimate suspicion.
The statistics, however, are unique, and a complete investigation is therefore
required. This investigation has been carried out, as already stated, in two stages :
(1) for the epoch 1703-1754, and (2) for the epoch 1755-1828. The break at 1828
is due to the fact that the figures for one year, including a small part of 1829, and
nearly the whole of 1830, are unfortunately wanting. The epoch 1831-18387 is
obviously not in itself long enough to repay study.

The results for the second epoch are considered first ; when the graph for this
epoch is examined and compared with that for the epoch 18388-1913 (Diagram IV),
surprising differences are found to exist. For the years 1755-1828 the main period
is that of two years exactly, or perhaps very slightly less. No evidence of a period
in the neighbourhood of 97 weeks is to be found. The annual and semi-annual
periods are also not nearly so prominent. The period of 114 weeks, however, has
not necessarily disappeared. The amplitudes for the periods of 112 and 113 weeks
are respectively 197 and 199. ‘This difference between 112°5 and 114 weeks is not
beyond the variation already found in the examination of the figures for the
