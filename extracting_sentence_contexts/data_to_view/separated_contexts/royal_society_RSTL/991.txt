Lepidolite, treated in the same way, gave potash. A piece of vitreous lava, from Etna, gave alkaline matter,
which seemed to be a mixture of soda, potash, and lime. As in these trials the object was merely to ascertain the
general fact of decomposition, the process was never con-
ducted for a sufficient time to develope a quantity of alkaline
matter capable of being conveniently weighed, and of course
any loss of weight of the substance could not be determined,

I thought it right, however, to make one experiment of this

kind, for the sake of removing every possibility of doubt on
the source of the different products : and I selected for this
purpose glass, as a substance apparently insoluble in water,
and not likely-to/afford in any way erroneous results. -The balance that I employed was made for the Royal
Institution, by Mr. FipLEs, after the model of that belonging
to the Royal Society ; it turns readily with +5 of a grain
when loaded with 100 grains on each side ; a glass tube with
a platina wire attached, weighing 84, grains 55 was con-
nected with an agate cup, by amianthus ; they were filled with
purified water, and electrified by a power from 150 pairs of
plates, in such a way that the platina in the glass tube was
negative.
