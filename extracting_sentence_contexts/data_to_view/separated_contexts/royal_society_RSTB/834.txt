With both external and median dorsal. cell groups of each side, but mainly with
S those of the same side.

cs 2. With the dorsal plexus of each side. Finally it should be remembered that the dorsal cell groups of the same side are
‘5 connected by the dorsal arcuate fibres.

= ‘These dorsal cells and the dorsal coarser fibrous reticulum I regard as the motor
portion of the anterior half of the ganglion.

® It may be well here to emphasize the fact that the elements of the entire ganglion
9 are placed in the most intimate connection by means of the complex central plexus.
$ No conception of this primitive nervous system will be an adequate one which does
& not realize the fact that it is throughout a cell and fibre plexus condensed along
&. certain lines. Even the well-marked bundle of fibres passing from the commissure
= direct to the anterior nerve is, in its course through the ganglionic plexus, intimately
6 related to, and obviously a part of, that structure, being connected with it by
% filaments.

3 The posterior half of the ganglion (tig. 6) is very different in its arrangement from
eI the anterior part just described. It consists, like the former, of a swelling on each
6 nerve cord, which is oval in transverse section, and of a pair of nerves, one on each
side, arising from their lateral aspects.
