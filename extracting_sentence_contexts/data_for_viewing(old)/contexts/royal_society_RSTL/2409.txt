VIII. On the Theory of the Moon. By Jonn Wutam LuBBock, Esq. V.P, and
Treas. R.S.

WurN I commenced the investigations relating to the theory of the moon which
I have had the honour to communicate to the Society, I proposed to show how, by a
different but more direct method, the numerical results given by M. Damorstau might.
be obtained. The approximations were in fact carried much further by M. Damorstau
than had been done before, and the details which accompany M. Damotszav's work
evince at once the immense labour of the undertaking, and inspire confidence in the
accuracy of the results offered. But the state of the question is now changed by the
appearance of M. PLaxa's admirable work, entitled © Th6orie du Mouvement de la
Lune,” in which, although M. Prana employs the same differential equations as those
used by M. Daworstav, and obtains in the same manner finally the expressions for
the coordinates of the moon, in terms of the mean longitude by the reversion of
Series, yet M. PLaxa's expressions have a very different analytical character and im-
portance, from the circumstance that the author develops all the quantities intro-
duced by integration, according to powers of the quantity called m, which expresses
the ratio of the sun's mean motion to that of the moon. In this form of the expression
the coefficients of the different powers of m, of the eccentricity, &c., are determinate,
