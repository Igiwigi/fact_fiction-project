5 Lrefrain on the present occasion from a more particular discussion of the foregoing

& 8ix species of quartic scrolls. I establish two other species, as follows ;—

= Quartic Seroll, Seventh Species, $(1, 2, 2), with nodal directris line, and nodal directris
cone which meet, and with a simple directris conic which meets the nodal conic in

E two points.

Z 44. We ee, @ priori, that the scroll generated as above will be of the order 4, that

S1s, a quartic scroll. In fact using the formula (ante, No. 5),
N

i Order =2mnp—am—ſpn—yp,
E we have here

2 Nodal conic, m=2, «=0,
SZ Simple conic, n =2, B=1,
S Line , p=1l, y=2,
S and hence

= Order =8—2—2, =4.
