CEREBELLUM OF ECHIDNA ACULEATA 49

but upon the great expansion of the ventral nucleus. This is further empha-
sized by the relation of this “ pulvinar” to the mid-brain. A true pulvinar—as
seen in Primates—is an expression of the enlargement of the higher physiological
levels of the thalamus, and it projects caudally dorsal to the tectum, But in Echidna
the projection is lateral to the mid-brain and is due, not to the size of the higher
physiological level, but to the hypertrophy of the lower.

At the caudal border of the “ pulvinar,” and in the course of the optic tract, is
a fusiform swelling, the lateral geniculate body. This was present on both sides of the
diencephalon in the six Echidna brains examined, and was described by ZIEHEN
(1897, a). That it is not always present in Echidna is shown by the fact that it was
absent from the brain-stem described by Extior Smrru (1902). It is small, in
keeping with the size of the optic tract, and is continued dorsally in the superior
brachium. Medial to the lateral geniculate body, and rather more caudally, is a
low swelling over the anterior end of the inferior brachium and the lateral border
of the cerebral peduncle, fig. 1. This is the medial geniculate body. It was
so described by ZirHEeNn (1897, a) “subject to microscopic confirmation.” A
medial geniculate body was not externally obvious in the brain-stem described by
Exxiot Smiru and he rightly concluded that hearing is not an important function
in Echidna. Of the six brains examined, only one possessed well-marked medial
geniculate bodies. In the others the swelling was less conspicuous or even absent.
The projection of this body is due, not to its inherent size, but to the projection of
the lateral border of the underlying cerebral peduncle and is, therefore, liable to
