type to the right in the figure) and traits that reduce the variance o (shift the
phenotype down in the figure). Selection will be neutral with respect to traits
that increase the mean and variance (or decrease the mean and variance) in a
proportion set by the population size: when Ajz = NAo?. These indifference
curves are indicated for small and large NW by dashed lines. The shaded area
represents the combinations of jz and o? that are evolutionarily accessible,
while the unshaded area represents phenotypes that are inaccessible due to
developmental, energetic, environmental or other constraints. The evolutionarily
stable strategy in such a system will be a point on the boundary of the set of
accessible states where the slope of the boundary is N, as this is the point in
the figure that maximizes the effective fitness We = ju — oN.

greater value of y1, despite the fact that this allele would also
have a higher value of o”.

Thus, with genomic imprinting, we no longer have a
purely stable ESS. Assuming the boundary of accessible strat-
egies is smooth, if we start at the ESS for an unimprinted
locus, the population will be subject to invasion by alleles
at imprinted loci. If o%, > 0%, there will exist accessible
strategies that increase 4 and o” that will be favoured by
natural selection on alleles at a maternally expressed locus.
Likewise, there will be accessible strategies that reduce w
and o? that will be favoured by natural selection acting on
a paternally expressed locus.
