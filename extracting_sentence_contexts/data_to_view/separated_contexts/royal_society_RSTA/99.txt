When the number of
meteorites is large, the potential energy lost in the first process is very great compared
with that lost in the subsequent partial condensation into meteorites.* Thus, the
energy lost in the partial condensation is negligible. * It depends, in fact, on the square of the ratio of the diameter 2a to the linear dimersion of one of
the equal spaces. 6 PROFESSOR G. H. DARWIN ON THE MECHANICAL CONDITIONS OF If Â» be'the attractional constant, the lost energy of condensation is well known to
be $4M,2/a.
