INTRODUCTION. It is now a well-known fact that every Flat-fish begins life with the eyes in the
normal position ; the asymmetry of its skull is not born with it, but acquired during
the early development. The conversion of a normal fish is thus a constant occurrence,
year by year, and we should be able to determine the causes of the phenomenon. The normal condition may be taken for granted ; the abnormal requires explanation,

The adult asymmetry of a few forms is also known, but the descriptions are
imperfect or incomplete.
