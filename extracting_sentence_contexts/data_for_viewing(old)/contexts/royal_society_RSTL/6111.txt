If a similar state of things could be detected upon a glacier, it would at once lay the
axe to the root of all the scruples above referred to, and place the pressure theory upon
an unassailable basis. The consciousness of this was sufficient to stimulate me in the
earch of such evidence.

T had visited all the glaciers hitherto mentioned, and others not mentioned, without

obtaining more than one clear case of the kind: this case I observed upon the Aletsch
Splacier on the 6th of August. Not far from the junction of the Middle Aletsch glacier
Avith the trunk stream, a crevasse exposed a wall of ice 50 or 60 feet in height, upon
Syhich the stratification was exposed, and cutting the stratification at a high angle were
Sthe groovings which marked the true veined structure. The association was distinct ;
any friend Professor Ramsay was with me at the time; I drew his attention to the fact.
Sand to him the case was perfectly conclusive. Thus the Aletsch glacier, which had
Sheen referred to by Mr. Barr as furnishing evidence against the pressure theory, gave
Sus a fact, which, as far as I could see, was perfectly fatal to the theory of stratiti-
Zeation.

But the case was solitary, and although inspiriting at the moment, its effect upon the
ER became feeble as time passed, and no repetition of the observation occurred. 1
Shad remained at the Riffel from the 9th to the 18th of August, exploring all the adja-
Scent glaciers, and adding each day to my stock of knowledge ; but I met no case in which
Sthe structure and the bedding were s0 clearly and independently exhibited, as to leave
Zan adherent of the stratification theory no room for doubt. Wednesday the 18th of
SAugust was to be my last day at the Riffel, and it was devoted to the examination of
