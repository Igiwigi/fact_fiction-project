In the Porpoise we have found that the scalenus is enormously developed although
the cervical vertebre are quite destitute of motion ; in the Seal, whose neck is re-
markably flexible, the scaleni are quite insignificant (\ 58). It is very evident that
the scaleni do not act to draw the vertebrz to either side; how can they in the Por-
poise? and in the Seal, whose neck is 80 bending, why are they not unusually deve-
loped? it is because they do not act on the yertebre laterally, and because the
mobility of the vertebrae would interfere with their action on the ribs.

We find all through that the scaleni are small in those animals whose necks are
mobile, and large in those that have inflexible necks. Though the scaleni do not
move the vertebre sideways, they do draw them downwards and forwards, at the same
time that they raise the first ribs. The two fixed points in fact approach each other.

73. The combined triangulares sterni and transversales form one vast constrictor of
neck, chest and abdomen, which rises into the neck.

The development of the scalenus, sterno-hyoid and thyroid, to cause the expansion
of the lungs in the neck, is counterbalanced during expiration by the development
in a remarkable manner of the sterno-costal, or triangulares sterni muscles (see ( 68)*.
In the Porpoise, the upper portion of these museles, that in all other animals rises only
to the second rib, ascends quite into the neck, embraces the lower half of the cervical
portion of lung, and is inserted into the whole circuit of the first rib. In the Por-
poise, as in the animals we formerly examined (Ã¾ 68), the sterno-costal museles unite
with the transversales ; and they unite to form an enormous muscle, one vast constrictor
