challenges. In Li-ion batteries, formation of Li dendrites during charging can puncture the battery
membrane separating the anode from the cathode, causing a leakage of flammable electrolyte if
the electrolyte is liquid, or causing a short-circuit should the dendrites reach the cathode. Another
limitation of Li-ion batteries stems from the first charging cycle, which causes the formation of
a stable reduction product known as the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer at the anode
due to the fact that the anode and cathode lithiate at potentials outside the stability window
of common liquid electrolytes. Formation of the SEI layer diminishes the cathode capacity, thus
necessitating a larger amount of cathode material to be incorporated into the battery relative to
the anode mass. This additional material lowers the batteryâ€™s energy density. Another downfall
of the charge-discharge process in Li-ion batteries is that a poorly formed SEI will limit battery
cycle life due to continuous reactivity of the electrolyte at the anode and irreversible loss of
Lit ions [2].

From an economic standpoint, the increasingly widespread adoption of rechargeable batteries
also highlights the difference in cost and geopolitical availability between Li metal and more
abundant metals such as Na, Mg, K, Ca or Al. These heavier metals are indeed the focus of intense
research in the context of electrical energy storage, but present their own challenges. Na, an
attractive candidate due to its high abundance, relatively small ionic radius, high specific capacity
