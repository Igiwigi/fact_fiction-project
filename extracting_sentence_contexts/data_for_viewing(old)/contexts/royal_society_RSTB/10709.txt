by supposing that there is a race between two LATER-like 3. The functional types of stopping and stillness

units, a Go unit that initiates the movement, and a Stop
unit, driven by the stop signal, that acts to suppress the Go
unit and thus causes countermanding to occur. Because of
the intrinsic randomness of these two processes, for a given
delay the Stop unit will sometimes successfully inhibit the
Go unit before the latter can initiate the movement, and
sometimes not. The details of such a model, and of several
others that can explain other kinds of stopping experiments,
are described in Nooraniâ€™s contribution to this issue [34].
Perhaps some apology is needed for what may seem an
overemphasis on eye movements. The fact is that we know
much more about eye movements and their control by the
brain than any other aspect of the motor system. The
reason is partly that the output of the oculomotor system is
relatively simple (with only three degrees of freedom for
each eye), and relatively easy to measure both quickly and (a) Long-term, global
accurately; in addition, it is a system with a well-defined
input (primarily visual and vestibular, with some additional
mechanoreceptor information). Correspondingly, the under-
lying neural circuits are relatively well-defined and have
been very thoroughly investigated, with a tradition of precise
quantitative analysis that is largely due to the pioneering
work of David Robinson, originally trained as an engineer
