PraTear's experiments consisted in measuring the pressure of the air confined in a
s0ap bubble by means of a water manometer. A decrease in that pressure might be
expected if the thickness of the film became less than twice the radius of molecular
attraction. His conclusion is based on the fact that no regular change was observed in
the case of a bubble which lasted for three days, and thinned to the pale yellow of the
first order of NewrToN's scale. Lipres formed a liquid film at one end of a cylindrical tube, and, when it had
become thin, closed the other end by a newly formed film. A 8mall quantity of air
was then forced into the enclosed space through an orifice in the 8ide of the tube.
