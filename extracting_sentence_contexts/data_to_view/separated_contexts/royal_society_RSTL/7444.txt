Around the star 108 the nebulosity seems to have a spiral character, and the same ap-
pearance, though much less decided, may be seen round 4. Round the stars 46,, 46,,,
and 99, the nebulosity seems to have been concentrated, but close to them there appears
tobe an absence of nebulosity; and in the case of 99, the dark hole is situated excentri-
cally with respect to the principal star, its nearer companion being close to the opposite
Side of the hole#®; but in the case of the double star 46, 46,, the hole is nearly symme-
trically situated, but the nebulosity is brightest at the north preceding side. We can
