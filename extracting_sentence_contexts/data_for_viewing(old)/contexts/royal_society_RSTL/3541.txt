of the differences in our observations.

53, A very superficial examination of the drawings, will suffice to discover the
prineipal differences here referred to. It will be seen that the nucleus of the blood-
corpuscle—usually considered, I believe, as a single object—is represented by me as
composed, in some instances, of two, three, or even many parts ; these having a
constant and determinate form. The substance surrounding the nucleus is, I think,
even by the latest obseryers, regarded simply as © the red colouring matter,” —
forming the contents of what has been denominated the blood-cell. I find it not
uncommon to be able to distinguish in this substance a great number of discs or
cell-like objects; and, what is equally remarkable, to discern (in certain states of
the corpuscle) an orifice in the delicate membrane by which this snbstance is sur-
rounded. But it is not 80 much these facts to which I ask attention, as certain
conclusions which they, with others, have enabled me to form.

54. In another memoir, also presented to the Royal Society#, I was under the
necessity of expressing opinions no less differing from those of very distinguished
pbysiologists, on a subject of the first importance ; affecting, as it does, every tissue
of which organized beings are composed—the physiology of © cells.” ScaLemex
had stated, that, after giving origin to the membrane of its cell, the nucleus has per-
formed its chief office ; and that, when it does not continue at the surface of the cell,
the nucleus is © cast off as a useless member, and absorbed$.” Scnwaxx had said,
that, with the exception of fat-globules having in some instances, in fat-cells, been
seen to arise out of it, he had never observed anything whatever to be produced by the
nucleus of the cellh. My observations, on the contrary, showed the nucleus to have
