EVOLUTION, AND ORIGIN OF THE AMPHIBIA. 59

basioccipital which forms the middle part of the large tripartite condyle of Eryops,
is quite similar to that in which the paired exoccipital condyle of Diademodon is
developed by the gradual retraction and thinning of the middle basioccipital portion
of the tripartite condyle of a Gorgonopsid such as Seymnognathus.

The great development of the outer part of the epipterygoid in Cyclotosaurus, and
the reduction in height of the quadrate ramus of the pterygoid in that group, is also
not altogether unparalleled amongst the Gorgonopsids and Cynogathids.

Perhaps the fact of greatest general morphological importance established in this
paper is that a hypoglossal nerve was an almost constant feature of the early large
Amphibia. In Trimerorachis, Lydekkerina, Capitosaurus, Trematosaurus, ete., there
is a foramen which in its position agrees exactly with the hypoglossal foramen of
early Reptiles ; it leaves the skull in the same manner, and in Trimerorachis joins the
vagal foramen in a way only consistent with its having transmitted that nerve.

In Cyclotosaurus and Rhytidosteus, however, this opening is absent, and the vagal
foramen is placed very near the posterior surface of the exoccipital.

Tt has long been known that the living Amphibia are remarkable in having very
few post-otic cranial segments. A review of the literature, and a detailed description
of the facts in Amblystoma, has recently been given by Goopricu (11), who, in
