relational QM. Interpretations of QM that adhere to strong realism, like Many Worlds, or Bohm, [8
or other hidden variables theories, circumvent the Kochen-Specker theorem, which states that a)

in general there is no consistent assignment of a definite values to all variables, by restricting
the set of elementary variables describing the world (to the quantum state itself, or to Bohmian
trajectories, or else). Relational QM assumes seriously the Kochen-Specker theorem: variables
take value only at interactions. The stronger version of the realist credo is therefore in tension
with QM, and this is at the core of relational QM. It is not even realized in the relatively weaker
sense of considering a juxtaposition of all possible values relative to all possible systems. The
reason is that the very fact that a quantity has value with respect to some system is itself relative
to that system [12].

This weak realism of relational QM is in fact quite common in physics laboratories. Most
physicists would declare themselves ‘realists’, but not realists about y. As one of the two (very
good) referees of this paper put it: ‘In physicists’ circles, Schrédinger’s is mostly regarded as a
mere instrument’. Relational QM is a way to make this position coherent.

There are three specific challenges to strong realism that are implicit in relational QM.

The first is its sparse ontology. The question of ‘what happens between quantum events’ is
meangless in the theory. The happening of the world is a very fine-grained but discrete swarming
of quantum events, not the permanence of entities that have well-defined properties at each
moment of a continuous time.

This is the way the relational interpretation circumvents results like the Pusey—Barrett—
