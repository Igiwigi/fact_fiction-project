This was done without shifting the coil both before and after each experi-
ment ; the two results never differed by more than ‘0007 B.A. unit, and the mean has
been taken in calculating the result. The resistance of the strip at 17° C. was
10011 B.A. unit. For some of the experiments this resistance might, with advantage, have been
higher, though the fact that it was nearly equal to the standard secured accuracy in
the comparison with it, and it was thought desirable, from this point of view, to
use the same resistance throughout. In order to reduce the effects due to variations in the resistance of the voltameters,
a resistance of thick platinoid wire, usually some twelve or fifteen ohms in amount,
was included in the circuit. This was varied until the current was of the right
amount.
