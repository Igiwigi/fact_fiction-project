one 80 put; it is simply an opinion, and I can scarcely say more than that mine does
not coincide with it. I would gladly enter upon the subject and endeavour to give
the objection a scientific form were the necessary time at my disposal, but this, I
regret to say, is not the case at present. I sball moreover be better pleased to deal
with the objection after it has assumed a more definite form in the hands of its pro-
poser, for I entertain no doubt that it is capable of a sufficient answer. The second
objection M. MaTTEuccr considers to be a more grave one. The facts are as follows :—
the repulsion of a mass of crystallized bismuth depends upon the direction in which
the mass is magnetized. When the magnetizing force acts in a certain direction, the
intensity of magnetization, and the consequent repulsion of the mass, is a maximum,
This is proved by placing the mass upon the end of a torsion beam and bringing its
several directions successively into the line of the magnetic force. Porss0Nn would
have called such a direction through the mass a principal axis of magnetic induction,
and I have elsewhere called it a line of elective polarity. When a spbere or cube of
bismuth is freely suspended in the magnetic field, with the direction referred to hori-
zontal, in all positions except two the forces acting on the mass tend to turn it ; those
positions are, when the line of maximum magnetization is axial and when it is equa-
torial, the former being a position of unstable, and the latter a position of stable
equilibrium. When the above line is oblique to the direction magnetization, the
