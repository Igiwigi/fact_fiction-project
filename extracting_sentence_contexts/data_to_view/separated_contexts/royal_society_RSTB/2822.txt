According to KirHn|| the fungus is
found in the roots of Kaulfussia, of Angiopteris, and of Marattia alata, but not in
those of Marattia fraxinea ; but no reduction is to be noted as the result in the
former Ferns as compared with the latter. Again, Cyathea is stated to have
mycorhiza, while Aspleniwnu nidus has not.{ Such facts as these make me think
that it cannot be justly assumed that the mycorhizic habit in the Ophioglossacez has
been a source of general reduction in the family. The argument in favour of their
being a reduction series will have to be based on other evidence. Pending the statement of that evidence, I may say that the view of them as an
ascending series appears to me the more probable.
