conductivity induced by cold.

2. Paralysis of Conductivity, and Restoration by Tetanising Shock.

In connection with this subject, I came across the interesting phenomenon of
paralysis of conductivity as an after-effect of intense cooling. After obtaining the
record of the block under local application of cold, the fragments of ice were removed
and the cooled portion of the petiole allowed to regain the temperature of the room,
which must have been accomplished in course of 20 minutes. After this, on taking the
record of the transmitted effect of stimulus, I found that the block of conduction was
still persistent. The conducting power of the benumbed tissue is thus paralysed for a
period which generally lasts for about 45 minutes. I have, however, discovered the
very suggestive fact that the lost conducting power can be very quickly restored by
subjecting the paralysed portion of the petiole to the action of tetanising electric
shocks.
