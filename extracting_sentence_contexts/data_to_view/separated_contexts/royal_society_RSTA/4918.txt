Cpa (yo— Pa)
(at+bp,+epe) {b (ype) +e (ys— pase)? —1 5 = (bp, (yi— Pe) +P (Ya Ps) *. These define y, — p,x, and y, — pw as functions of p, and ps, and are, therefore,
the Clairaut form, and may be integrated by substituting ¢, for p, and ¢, for py,

The integral in this form will represent four lines of a congruency, which co
