Had the theo-
retical value been in defect instead of in excess, the difference might have been
ascribed to an effect of secular change; in which case M. Gavuss's map might be
supposed to represent an earlier state of the phenomena than that of the year 1840. But the fact is otherwise ; the theoretical value of the line in question is in excess,
although its actual value has been progressiyely increasing since the earliest record
of the phenomena, and was greater in 1848 than in any antecedent year since the
phenomena have been observed. 'The theoretical error is the more remarkable
because Mr. BarLow's map for 1833, which was the one employed by M. Gauss for
the declination, gives the value of that element correctly at 20* or thereabouts, at
the spot where M.
