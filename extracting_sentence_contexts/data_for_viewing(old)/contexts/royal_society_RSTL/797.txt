and found inspissation produce the same effect on it, as coa-
gulation does on the other; that a similar net-work is formed,
and apparently by the same means, since if pus is deprived
of its carbonic acid gas (of which it contains a large quan-
tity) by exhaustion in the air pump, no such net-work takes
place. |

This is a fact of considerable importance in practical sur-
gery, for since we now know that inspissated pus can become
vascular, similar to coagulated blood, we have arrived at the
principle on which granulations are formed, and from whence
they derive the power of contraction, which is found to be
inherent in them ; we also can account for the great advan=-
tage of compression upon the surface of sores ; since by that
means all the superfluous pus is removed, leaving only
enough for inspissation, in which state the carbonic acid gas
is extricated, forming channels so as to admit of its becoming
afterwards vascular, and then taking on the form of healthy
granulations.
