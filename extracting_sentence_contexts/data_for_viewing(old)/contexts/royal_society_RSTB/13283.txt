The survey revealed that many houses had some sort of
damage that could potentially allow mosquito access
(table 2). The majority of doors either had holes or gaps
and this was largely consistent between control and treat-
ment villages. The percentage of houses with damaged
walls was much lower but was again consistent between trea-
ted and control villages. Around 35% of control houses had
gaps in part of the eaves. For houses in the treatment arm,
the gaps in the eaves were marginally higher (41.5%) than
controls during the September survey but lower in the
November survey (14.5%). This reduction between Septem-
ber 2018 and November 2018 likely reflects the fact that the
implementation team in the CRT visited the houses in the
treatment villages 2-3 times per year to conduct basic repairs
to maintain the ‘mosquito proofing’, and one of these repair
rounds occurred during this period. The effect of repairs
can also be seen in the window screening, whereby 48% of
the houses surveyed in the treatment villages in September
had some sort of damage, whereas this was only 6% for
houses surveyed in November (note, however, that houses
were randomly selected in the villages so there could also
be a sampling effect here as the same houses were not necess-
arily inspected on both occasions).
