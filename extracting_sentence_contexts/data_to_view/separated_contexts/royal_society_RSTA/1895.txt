The bed
consist of a regular array of cylinders (which appear to be spheres in 2D) and it is simulated
to study the reactant consumption rate, q, under different control parameters. It is easy to realize
that the consumption rate, q, depends in principle on many parameters such as, e.g., the inflow
concentration(s), the flow velocity /pressure drop in the bed, the reaction rate coefficient (which
is a function of electric field), the bead size and geometry, etc. Here, we want to stress the fact
that the consumption rate, q, shows a non-trivial dependency from a number of these parameters


and, in particular, it has a maximum for intermediate values of some of them, therefore a non- Lo |
trivial trade-off exists. In this manuscript, we limit our self to study the dependency from three

relevant parameters, i.e. the packed bed porosity, the bead size and the pressure drop through 13
the bed. The simulated packing geometry of the reactor is the same as that shown in figure 1.
