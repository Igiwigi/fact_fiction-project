tes cut nearly normal to the plane of the optic axes. By combining with the
vple of 58? 22 found on the twins of the type No. 1 this number 89* 12', an inclina-
of 123* 14' may be deduced for that between the plane of the optic axes
dYonging to one region of the plate and that belonging to the other region of it.
(Ehe measures that were made with plates similar to those of figs. 2 and 4 vary
beween 122* 42' and 123? 31.) As for the adjustment of the two regions of the
@tion with regard to the plane of the optic axes and to their bisector, when this
has been made as accurate as possible with regard to the one it is slightly inac-
zurate with regard to the other, exactly as is the case with the twins similar to
those in fig. 1.
On the laminar masses from which I obtained the plates of the types 2 and 4 I have

* The same fact may be observed in crystals of calcite and of aragonite traversed by twin lamellae, where the
race of these ceases to be visible upon the faces at which they come out, when they present more than a
certain degree of thinness.

+ I am indebted to M. Conxw for images of these obtained by means of a small solar microscope in the
laboratory of the Keole Polytechnique.
