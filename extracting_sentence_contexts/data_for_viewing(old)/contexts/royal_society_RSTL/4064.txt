at intervals give way, and by some unknown force (perhaps a vis @ tergo, from
accumulated secretion) the elaborated material is passed on to the next in order ; a
similar process being repeated in each cell of the series, till, by the dehiscence of the
terminal one, the secretion is set free in the cavity of the duct.

APPENDIX.

The condition of the cells with regard to their coalescence is very various ; in
livers of sheep examined during the winter, a section, however thin, has been 80
opake that no satisfactory view could be obtained of it; in such the cells are found
gorged with particles of secretion, and seldom, if at all, communicating ; the base-
ment membrane of the ducts has also a semi-fibrous aspect, and it is rare to observe
the margin in an active condition. These facts, and the circumstance that the fusion
of the cells is not 80 frequent in any case, as we should expect if it were essential,
have led me subsequently to believe that a process of transmission may $0 on through
the septa of the rows of cells and basement membrane, though there can be no doubt
that it must proceed much more rapidly when the cells have coalesced and the base-
ment membrane disappeared.
