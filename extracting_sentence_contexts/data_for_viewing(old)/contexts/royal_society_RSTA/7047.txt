NON-SINGULAR LINEAR INTEGRAL EQUATIONS 515

The fact that the vector suffers less change than the eigenvalue when the difference
correction is applied is no unusual feature of eigenvalue problems, and was noticed by
Fox (1947, 1949) in connexion with the solution of differential equations. This phenomenon
is not confined to oscillatory functions. Consider, for example, the integral equation

1
Af (2-+92) fly) dy f(x): (42)
It is easy to show that this has two eigenvalues, given by the roots of the equation

42+ 30A—45 = 0,

and the eigenfunctions have the form x2—4+ 71.
