thus, as in the hypsometric maps, at lines of equal height. But such representations do not satisfy

the fundamental requirement of statistical diagrams, that is, to show the change of the facts to the eye
directly, in an immediate way, without appealing to a mental process, for instance, to the view of
figures, This is not the case with isohypsos; one line is like the other, and thus we do not know by
immediate sight, but only by inqniry of the figures, which height we have before the eye. Bya single
inspection we do not even know whether the concentric lines ought to represent a peak or a crater; it is

844 MR. J. KOROSI ON AN ESTIMATE OF THE DEGREES OF LEGITIMATE

The general direction of the isogens is given by the fact that the highest is
to be found where both parents are young, and the lowest where one or both are
towards the end of the procreative period. If we were to regard the eurved surface
of the natalities as a hypsometric relief, we should say that this mountainous relief
has its top in the north-west corner and the null-points in the south and in the east.

As the natality of the mothers begins nearly always immediately with its maximum,
the horizontal passing of this mountain leads nearly continuously downwards. But
the natality of the men rises till 24 years and begins to fall only from this point.
Thus, if we step over the mountain from north to south, we have to cross the ridge

only by a study of the figures inscribed against the curves that we learn if the central circle means the
bottom of a hole or the top of a mountain, that is, if we have before us a rise or a descent of the curve.
