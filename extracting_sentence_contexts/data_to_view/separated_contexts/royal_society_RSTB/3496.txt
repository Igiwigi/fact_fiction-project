The section figured lies far
forward in the cephalic region, cutting across the anterior thickened extremity of
the archenteron (cf. figs. 69 and 71). Owing to this fact the medullary plate is
narrower, and the extra-medullary intermediate zone of ectoderm is thinner
relatively to the medullary plate, than would be the case a little further back, across
the wider part of the cephalic expansion. It appears clear that the extra-medullary zone here figured and described must be
regarded as consisting of neural ectoderm, and as forming the ectodermal Anlage
of the “neural crest,” from which, at a slightly later stage, the cephalic ganglionic
outgrowths already described take their origin. As this intermediate zone of neural ectoderm is continued backwards behind the
cephalic expansion, its definite peripheral limit, in this stage, gradually disappears ;
but it is, nevertheless, still represented by the zone of thick ectoderm which covers
the lateral region of the paraxial zone beyond the still recognisable lateral margin
of the medullary plate.
