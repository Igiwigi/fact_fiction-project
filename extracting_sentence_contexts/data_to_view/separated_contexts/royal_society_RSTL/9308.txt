Kach hexad gives 15 8uch surfaces, or
the number of quadric surfaces is (16 x 15=) 240. The 16-nodal quartic $urfaces,

121. Tf the four functions are those contained in any two pairs out of a tetrad of
pairs (8ee the foregoing © Table of the 120 pairs ”), then the locus is a quartic surface,
which is, in fact, a KUMaer's 16-nodal quartic surface. For if for a moment &.y and
2. are two pairs out of a tetrad, and 7.s be either of the remaining pairs of the
tetrad ; then we have 7s a linear function of ay and 2: squaring, 1s? ig a linear
function of a%?, yz, 22%; but we then have 1? and 8, each of them a linear function
of a?, 4f, 22, w?; or substituting we have an equation of the fourth order, containing
terms of the second order in (a?, 4, 2?, u?), and also a term in ayz2w. It is clear that
if instead of 7.5 we had taken the remaining pair of the tetrad we should have obtained
the same quartic equation in (x, y, 2, w).
