constant viscosity ; bub there is every reason to believe that the earth is a cooling
body, and has stiffened as it cooled. We therefore have to deal with a spheroid whose
viscosity diminishes as we look backwards.

A 8econd 8olution is accordingly given (Section 17) where the viscosity is variable; no
definite law of diminution of viscosity is assumed, however, but it is merely s8upposed
that the viscosity always remains small from a tidal point of view. This solution gives
no indication of the time which may have elapsed, and differs chiefly from the preceding
one in the fact that bhe change in the obliquity is rather greater for a given amount of
change in the moon's distance.

There is nob much to say about it here, because the two solutions follow clogely
parallel lines as far as the place where the former one left off.

The first 8olution was not carried further, because as the month approximates in
length to the day, the three semi-diurnal tides cease to be of nearly equal frequencies,
and 80 likewise do the three diurnal tides; hence the assumption on which the solution
was founded, as to their approximately equal speeds, ceases to be sufficiently accurate,

In this 8econd solution all the seven tides are throughout distinguished from one
another. At about the stage where the previous g0lution sbops the solar terms have
