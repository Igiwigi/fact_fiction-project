If we work out the values of f,/, g,/, 1,’ we find they are as tabulated below :

1 + °012367 —*540511 — +112667
2 + °000573 — *024011 + 006901
3 + -000078 ~ +002538 + *002580
4 + 000025 — -001259 + *000896
5 + -000009 = 000217 + *000381
6 + *000005 ~ 000083 + °000195

Hence the parts of the © which depend upon /,//n®, f,//n®, g,//n® converge quite
rapidly enough to allow us to stop after the sixth term. It therefore merely remains
to evaluate the series

These cannot be expressed in finite terms, and although we may apply the Eurer-
MAacLaurin sum-formula to these series directly, though in a slightly modified form,
this sum-formula is not really of very great advantage, as its rapidity of convergence
depends on 2, and is such, for certain values of this variable, as to render the formula
useless as an approximation to the remainder. As a matter of fact, however, the
series were to be calculated only for values of z = ic/6, ¢ being any integer from
0 to 6. But for such values of z, the cosine terms repeat themselves after n = 6. Thus,
