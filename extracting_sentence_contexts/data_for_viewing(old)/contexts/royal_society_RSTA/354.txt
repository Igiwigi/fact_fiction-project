3. Technical options for implementing material efficiency

The White Paper identified four broad strategies for implementing material efficiency, expanded
to six here [12]:

— Light-weight design: Carruth ef al. [25] derive a set of technical principles for designing
light-weight products, and then test them on five commercial case studies, with detailed
evaluation within the current supply chain. Their evidence suggests that, on average,
one-third of all material use could be saved if product designs were optimized for
material use rather than for cost reduction, because downstream production (and design)
costs are generally dominated by labour and not materials. In addition, manufacturers
are motivated to use excess material by an asymmetry in the costs of product failure
compared with the costs of over-specification, and by the fact that many products
experience higher loads prior to use (in installation or transport) than in use.

— Reducing yield losses: individual manufacturing companies are typically confident that
their management of yield losses (generally measured as the difference between mass
of material purchased and the mass of material eventually used in products) is well
under control. However, Milford et al. [26] report a series of case studies examining yield
losses along the entire supply chain—from liquid metal to final products—and show
remarkably high accumulated losses. In particular, for goods made from sheet metal,
approximately half of all liquid metal becomes scrap (which is then recycled in most
cases) en route to the final product. The worst losses occurred in blanking (10% for sheet
metal, with similar losses found for the printing and packaging industry) and trimming
after stamping (15-30%), and appear to have had little attention. New technologies could
