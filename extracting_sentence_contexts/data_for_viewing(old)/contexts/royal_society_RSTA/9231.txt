by 2pa/q, where « is the small angle of the wedge.

If the law were partly exponential and partly of the probability type, or
I = I, exp(—/’x’?—qz), where # and g are positive constants, the graph on the plate
would become

key’ +qy = px tan a,

and it is easily demonstrated that this is a parabola exactly similar—and, in fact,
equal—to the parabola obtained when g = 0, but shifted on the plate so that its axis
has moved parallel to itself. The curve is therefore still symmetrical about its axis
and curved towards it, so that this mixed law is incapable of explaining the
characteristics of the photographs even on general grounds, In fact, the constant ¢
has no influence on the radius of curvature. It would, however, have an influence
if the law with which the simple exponential is combined were anything other than
the law of probability.

This lack of influence of g, however, only applies to corresponding points, and
in order to avoid misconception, a more complete account is necessary, for the curve
as seen on the plate would actually appear flatter and be of smaller extent. At the
same time it undergoes a sudden change of curvature at the vertex. In the annexed
figure (fig. 83) the dotted curve is the parabola which would be obtained when g = 0.
The other parabola ABCDE is the shifted parabola obtained when gq is not zero,
as explained already. But only the portion ABC appears on the plate, for the
axis OX cannot be disturbed by the presence of the new exponential factor, which
