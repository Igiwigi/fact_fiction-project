stand-off distances enables a much more efficient approach to mission operations. Stand-off
Raman spectroscopy is already a well-established technique for terrestrial applications (e.g. in
the fields of geology and mineralogy) and for the past decade, efforts have been focused upon
adapting and miniaturizing the instrumentation so that it can be used for planetary exploration
[73]. Through the use of gated detectors and pulsed lasers (which, in combination, significantly
reduce noise from ambient light and fluorescence) and telescopic optics [73-75], Raman analysis
has been successfully performed at distances of over 120 m from the sample, in high level, ambient
light conditions (i.e. outside, during daylight) [74]. The retrieval of information from a remote
distance not only removes the need for rover relocation (saving time, power and other resources)


but also allows the exploration of what would normally be inaccessible regions of a planet [35]. Lo |
In fact, in addition to the prospect of deploying a stand-off Raman instrument on Mars, a recent

Science Definition Report has identified Raman analysis as a key element in the exploration of â€œ3
Europa [76], and it is reported that a stand-off Raman instrument, similar to existing prototypes, :
would be capable of measuring and identifying various salts, organic and CO} ice on the surface
of Europa, potentially to a depth of a few centimetres [77].

(c) Combined instrumentation

Another key aspect of future instrument development will be the development of highly
mass/power efficient systems (i.e. low mass and low power) which provide dual functionality.

For example, in recent years, efforts have been focused on developing a stand-off Raman/LIBS : 2
