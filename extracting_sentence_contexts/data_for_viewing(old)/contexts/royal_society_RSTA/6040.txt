is a parameter of temporal variability in the landscape, which verifies, in particular, the positions
of discordant structures. The reliable description of the localization of the maxima of landscape
variability involves the smoothing and the digital transformation o; in the circular sliding
window of radius r, with the use of Hanning’s transmission function.

An additional parameter, which verifies the position of discordant structures, can be called
the spatial density of lineaments. Since there is a direct analogy between the resulting structure of
lineaments and the fault tectonics, the increase in the density of lineaments is correctly interpreted
as an increase in the fragmentation. The procedure is based on the calculation in the sliding
window of radii r/2, r and 2r of the number of vertices of the mapped lineaments.

The physical basis of the method of assessing the rate of geological fragmentation with depth
and their conformity of geological and engineering setting of the task are based on the fact that
there are periodic and quasi-periodic components in the structure of any spatially distributed
field due to the formation of a standing wave

K(x, t) = Acos (kx)cos(wt — w),

in the spatial structure of an unbalanced geological environment [43]. Hence, it is possible to apply
the calculation of the spatial stationary parameter on the matrix of field values in sliding windows
of different sizes D, for different wavelengths D =A, with the approximate value of depth H=
4/2 [44]. A fixed-depth geological system is modelled as a polygonal structure associated with

the standing wave and characterized by an interval of wavelengths [AM,,, AH... ].
