The above result is so satisfactory that I have little doubt that we have deter-—
mined a very good value for oy/1 — p®. Substituting it we find for the correlation
between half-sisters :

The law of ancestral heredity gives for half-sisters r = ‘2, and 2? of this = ‘08.

Thus we see that the collateral heredity between half-sisters, daughters of the
same sire, is quite sensible, and is almost what we might have predicted would be
the result, if we supposed correlation to be weakened, as in the previous cases, to
2 of its value by fictitious records.

It is worth while to consider the amount of fictitious fecundity suggested by
the reduction factor 3. We have only to suppose the n,/N of our p. 277 to be 3.
Now we may well assume the chance of a fictitious fecundity being recorded to be
the same for either one of a pair of sisters ; hence we shall have p = q, and therefore,
from the result on p. 276, we find (p — 1)?/p?=2. This gives us (p — 1)p= 4,
and (7, + 7;)/N the fraction without fictitious values = (p — 1)/p = 6325. Thus
in order to introduce the reduction factor of 2 by the occurrence of fictitious values
of the fecundity, we should have to suppose about 37 per cent. of fictitious values to
occur. This is, of course, a sort of average; many values will probably be only
partially fictitious, ze, will to some extent approximate to their real values.
Considering the very artificial character of the thoroughbred brood-mare, and the
uncertainty of her treatment by breeders, this does not seem such an immense
percentage that it would force us to the conclusion that the law of ancestral heredity
