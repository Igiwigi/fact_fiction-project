unites it with the molecular state of the bodies through which it is transmitted.

Q 2. Influence of Magnetism on the Voltaic Arc.

Davy was the first who observed that a powerful magnet acts npon the voltaic arc
as upon a moveable conductor, traversed by an electric current; it attracts and
repels it, and this repulsion and attraction manifests itself by a change in the form of
the are. Even the action of the magnet may, as I have found, break the arc by too
great an attraction or repulsion exerted upon it, causing the communication which
the transmitted particles establish between the electrodes to cease.

The action which I have just mentioned is not the only one which magnetism
exerts on the voltaic arc. I bave already stated the curious fact, that if two
points of soft iron acting as electrodes, be both placed within a helix formed of thick
copper wire of several coils, the voltaic arc developed between the two points of iron
ceases the moment a strong current is passed through the wire of the helices, and
reappears if this current be arrested before the points have become cold. The arc
cannot be formed between the two iron points when they are magnetized, whether
by the action of the helices, or by that of a powerful magnet, unless they be brought
much nearer to one another, and the appearance of the phenomenon is then entirely
different. The transported particles appear to disengage themselves with difficulty
from the positive electrode, sparks fly with noise in all directions, while in the former
case, it was a vivid light without sparks, and without noise, accompanied by the
transfer of a liquid mass, and this appeared to be effected with the greatest ease. It
is of little moment with respect to the result of the experiment, whether the two rods
