which determine the ratios « : Þ: y ... of the coefficients; and to each set of ratios
there corresponds a single value of Q. The order of the system, or number of sets of
ratios, is =}(n+1) . 20-", =(n+1). 2%; and this is consequently the number of
values of Q, or order of the equation for the determination of Q; viz. but for reduction
the order in Q of the N&-modular equation would be =(n +1). 2%, In the case
1=3, this is =4, which is right, but for any larger yalue of x the order is far too high ;
in fact, assuming (as the case is) that the order is equal to the order in v of the we-form,
the order should for a prime value of 2 be =2+1, and for a composite yalue not con-
taining any square factor be = the suwm of the divisors of n. I do not attempt a general
investigation, but confine myself to showing in what manner the reductions arise,
