The two occurred in the same ovary, and both can be
seen in the photograph of this ovary in figure 17a, plate 6. The darker corpus luteum
which lies between them is considerably older, and has lost its regular outline. It is thus
impossible to distinguish it from the remains of the corpora lutea of pregnancy such as
could be found in the ovaries of all the lactating animals, so that although it may in fact
represent a still earlier member of the post-partum series, it has been omitted from the
diagram. The ovary of E145 photographed in figure 17a was sliced across at several levels;
the uppermost portion has been removed completely, and a central portion has also been
cut out so as to reveal a cut surface about 1 cm lower than that in which the above-
mentioned corpora lutea lie. In this lower cut surface can be seen several follicles of
a diameter up to 5 mm, and a dark brown patch of irregular outline which is the persistent
remains of a very old corpus luteum.
