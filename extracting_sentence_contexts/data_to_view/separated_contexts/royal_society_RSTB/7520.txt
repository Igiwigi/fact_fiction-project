The foramen ovale is traversed in all the species studied by the
mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, and the artery which accompanies this nerve,
although having a different name in some species, is a homologous vessel. This vessel,
which is known as the middle meningeal artery in the rabbit and in man, is the counterpart
of the vessel termed the ramus anastomoticus in the cat, dog, sheep, goat, pig and ox. The
homologous nature of these vessels is emphasized by the fact that in the cat, dog and pig
a middle meningeal artery is given off by the ramus anastomoticus, and this is sometimes
larger than the continuation of the ramus anastomoticus. Further, in the sheep, goat and
ox, the dura of the middle fossa is supplied by the ramus anastomoticus. The middle
meningeal artery also gives off a branch to the middle ear (the petrosal artery) which
accompanies the petrosal nerves.
