because it is only in a living stomach that galvanism can have such an effect ;
but this effect bears too strong an analogy to other chemical results to be
wholly separated from them, although what we call life, whatever that may be,
is necessary to its production. The same effect, and one certainly of a very complicated nature, is here
produced by the nervous power and a chemical agent ; because when the latter
is substituted for the former, the same effect takes place, It is a simple matter
of fact. But it is maintained by some gentlemen that the same effect may be
produced by a mechanical agent*. They have related sevyeral experiments
which appeared to them to prove, that when after a part of the eighth pair of
nerves is removed, and thus the due secretion of gastric juice prevented, it may
be restored by mechanically irritating the cut ends of the lower portions of
the divided nerves.
