As I understand PLaTEav's theory,
developed by Lord RAyLEIGH, this would not be the case with disturbances growing
under the influence of surface tension alone. The forces of figure, then, either must
act in some definite way in both cases; or, if in the latter, they are entirely subordinate
to, and controlled by, the impressed forces, some further condition than the mere form
of the jet must be taken into account to explain the difference. In fact, their ole
action seems to be that they fix an upper and ill-defined limit to the rate of vibration
of the jet. With all vibrations below this limit they do not in any way interfere. The conclusion to be drawn is rather that a jet, ab least in its upper part, is not
comparable to a liquid cylinder at rest.
