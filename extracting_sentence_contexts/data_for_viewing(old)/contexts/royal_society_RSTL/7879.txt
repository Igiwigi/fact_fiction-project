indeed be stated that Gavss himself (as might have been expected from that acute and
accurate mind) is very far from asserting the aboye assumption to be an axiom ; conse-
quently he does not give his proof as more than hypothetical. He only states that the
rule is generally accepted—* axiomatis loco haberi solet hypothesis.” A method of
remarkable simplicity was given by Sir J. HErscneL in a very interesting review of
QuETELEr's © Letters on Probability,” which conducts to the same lay of error by means
of one or two bold assumptions ; but striking as the coincidence is, it can hardly be
seriously viewed as a demonstration; nor is it formally s0 presented by its distinguished
author. However, the methods both of Gavss and Sir J. HERsCHEL are of great interest
to the natural philosopher, as showing that certain & priori mathematical assumptions
of a very simple Kind lead to the same lay of error which reasoning based on a study of
the facts which surround us also points out as expressing, at least approximately, what
generally does occur in rerum naturd: though we can see no necessity that the facts

Also Boorz (Edinb, Trans, yol. xxi.) and Twoxsox and Tarr (Natural Philosophy), who speak more fayourably,
A. QuzreLzr's *Lettres? will amply repay a perusal ; in connexion with our present inquiry, he points out that
not only errors of obseryations, but the yariations of many other fluctuating magnitudes, 8uch as the stature of

men, the temperature of the weather, &, from their mean yalues, seem to follow tho samo law. If this be 80,

the inference gcoms legitimate that these divergences from the mean types, or errors of Nature herself, as they
may bo called, aro produced in each case, not by one or two, but by a yast number of hidden cooxisting causes.
