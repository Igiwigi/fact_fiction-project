Further, without actual evaluation, the complete set of linear relations connecting
the functions of a given weight would be very difficult to obtain.

By comparing the multiplication law of MacManon’s functions with the multiplication
law of the S-functions, remembering in particular that the product of the two S-functions
is the sum of multiples of $-functions with positive integral coefficients, it is clear that
each of MacManon’s functions is a linear function of S-functions with positive integral
coefficients.

Compared with MacManon’s functions, the S-functions have only one disadvantage.
The multiplication law is not quite so simple. To offset this there are numerous
advantages. The S-functions are linearly independent, and this fact alone more than
counterbalances the possible disadvantage of the more complicated multiplication rules.

Further, as we have shown, the connections between the S-functions and the products
of the functions §, may be read immediately from the table of characters of the
symmetric group.

Lastly, the more fundamental nature of the S-functions is illustrated by the formula
connecting these with the symmetric product sums.
