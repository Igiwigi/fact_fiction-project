GRAHAM ON SHEAR PATTERNS IN AN UNSTABLE LAYER OF ATR. 293

(a) The smoke comes away from the edges of the layer leaving a clear space about
1 em. wide all round. This indicates an ascent in the centre of the layer with descent
at the edges. The clear space is due to the fact that the smoke settles ; the velocity
of the air is very slow.

(b) Soon after the separation of the smoke from the edges a vortex roll forms along
each edge in the clear space.

(c) The smoke collects at several places and thins out in others.

(d) The number of these regions increases. This shows that as the bottom gets
hotter the number of centres of ascent gets greater.

(e) At several places round cells appear, more or less regularly disposed ; they have
very slow ascent in the centres, and are shown in fig. 16, Plate 4.

(f) The number of these rings increases until the whole layer becomes completely
unstable and is filled with a mixture of polygons and rolls.

(g) Finally the rolls turn into polygons which have descent in the centres, leaving the
space completely filled with polygons, see figs. 17 and 18. If the conditions are not regular the initial round rings of fig. 16 do not appear, but
instead the pattern of fig, 20, Plate 5, is shown.
