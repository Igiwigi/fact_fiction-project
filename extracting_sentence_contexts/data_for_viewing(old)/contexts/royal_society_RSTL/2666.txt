trical actions, would lead us to conclude that an electrified conductor of large di-
mensions could always charge a small body to saturation from any point of it,
provided the electrical 8tate of the touching body was such as would enable it to
become 80 charged : this is indeed quite evident from the fact that a compound ele-
ment $1 chas that already mentioned (8, 3.), and represented fig. 8, becomes charged
equally at whatever point of a long electrified cylinder, c, fig. 18, it is applied, whether

EXPERIMENTAL EXAMINATION OF THE INDICATIONS OF THE PROOF PLANE. 445

at the centre c or at the extremity a; as 2180 from the fact already noticed (36.), that
whatever part of a charged conductor be connected with the fixed disc of the balance,
or with any other species of electrometer, the instrument is equally affected. The
proof plane, therefore, if it really exhibits the ratios of the quantities of electri-
city disposed in different points of a charged body, must depend materially on the
resistance to an equal participation in the charge, arising from its little inductive
susceptibility ; it is hence very desirable to investigate experimentally the various
effects which increased thickness, or extension of any kind, position, intensity of
charge, and the like, may have on its indications. An experimental inquiry of this kind
is, however, extremely difficult : we are, for example, open to all the sources of fallacy
above described (15.), and illustrated by Table TV. Thus, if we examine the electrical
reactions, having previously charged the disc of the needle with some given quantity
of the same electricity, the subsequent quantities taken up by proof planes of yarious
