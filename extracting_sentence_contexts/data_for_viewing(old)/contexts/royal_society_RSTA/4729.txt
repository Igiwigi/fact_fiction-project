E(r,S,z):=
where 11 > 2 is the space dimension. This monotonicity implies that E(r) has a limit when r tends [4
to zero or infinity, and if we blow up a minimal surface then DNS

E(0,S,z) = ins E(rt,S,z) = ine E(t, Sy,Z) = E(t, So, 0), : S

which is constant in ¢. Here, we have denoted the scaling by S$, = {x:z + rx € S} and its limit, when
it exists, by So.

(ii) Classification of global solutions

Global minimal surfaces are cones, and in fact planes for n < 8, where Simon’s cone x1 + x2 + %3 +
x4 =X5 +. X6 +X7 + xg is minimal. This along with dilation and blow-up means that in some weak
sense local minimal surfaces are asymptotic to a cone (and to a plane in low dimensions), in the
sense that the measure of the symmetric difference between the set and a half space goes to zero.
Thus, locally, i.e. restricted to a fixed ball around the origin, (sub)sequences of dilations converge
to a plane or a cone in measure.

(iii) Positive density and asymptotic of local solutions

The next step is to reinforce the convergence through a uniform density lemma. More exactly, for
z€ S, one proves that B,(z) 1 St have measure proportional to r”. Here, S* denotes the set on each
side of S. This transforms convergence in measure to uniform convergence, i.e. asymptotically
near the origin, and inside a small B,, the surface S gets trapped into a flatter and flatter cone of
