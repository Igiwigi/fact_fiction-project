We must not however conclude, that this is the given dis-
tance at which it will always vanish. For instance, the same
satellite, though hardly to be seen, was however not quite in-
visible March 2, 1791. Its distance from the planet, computed
as before, was then only * X37 =19'",8.

The clearness of the atmosphere, and other favourable cir-
cumstances, must certainly have great influence in observations
of very faint objects; therefore, a computation of all the ob-
servations where the satellites were not seen, as well as a few
others where they were seen, when pretty near the apogee or
perigee, will be the surest way of settling the fact. The result
of these computations is thus.
