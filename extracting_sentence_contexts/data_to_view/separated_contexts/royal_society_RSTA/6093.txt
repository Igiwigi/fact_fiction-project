In order to obtain
a scale-invariant spectrum for perturbations in three large spatial dimensions, it is important that
the matter correlation functions have holographic scaling, i.e. they scale as the area of the box and :
not as the volume. The specifics of the emergent model are not important as long as these three :=
criteria are met. We will in fact see in the following section that the criteria can be realizaed in a Da
very different setting. :B

String Gas Cosmology provides a toy model of the very early Universe which goes beyond what
EFTs can yield. However, in [27], no dynamics for the emergent phase, the Hagedorn phase, was [8
provided.
