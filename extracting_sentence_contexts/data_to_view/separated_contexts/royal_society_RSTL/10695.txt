Over the foramen magnum the supraoccipital is
large, both high and wide, and the exoccipital (e.o.), is seen to be wider than the
lower view would indicate. There is no appearance of bone in the auditory capsule,
except over the front part of the anterior canal '(a.s.c.), and the sinus-opening ; the
labyrinthic part of the capsule is still cartilaginous. The oblique oblongo-crescentic
tract of bone seen, already, in the sphenotic and pterotic regions, is the first of the two
bony periotics formed in the auditory capsule in this type ; nobwithstanding its
growth along the crest of the capsule, and the fact that it does not help to enclose
the labyrinth, T consider it to be the © prootic,” and the other, formed afterwards,

the © opisthotic.”
