E. This plane corre-
bonds with the system C, which ought to be a joint and not a cleavage plane; but it
80 happens, that in this locality there is considerable local contortion in the bedding of
the conglomerate and thin shales; and throughout the entire area, in which the flaggy
cleavage had this abnormal direction, I found the strike of the beds to have an azimuth
or bearing within a few degrees of that of the cleavage. The bearing of the beds, in
fact, ranges from N. 5% W. to N. 33? W., dip 109 N. Thus this apparent exception to
ihe first mechanical law of cleavage turns out, on examination, to be a remarkable con-
firmation of it.
