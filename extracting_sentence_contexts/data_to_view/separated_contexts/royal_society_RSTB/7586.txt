Strong wind has a suppressive effect on taking-off and on flight
near the ground, but less effect on flight well above the ground. Fliers near the ground are
caused to settle by gusts, while taking-off occurs in lulls, so that gusty winds may
produce a resultant down-wind movement. These facts are consistent with the optomotor
theory. Speed of flight. The cruising air speed of Schistocerca is in the region of 3 m./sec., but when
flying close to the ground against a wind of varying speed the locusts seem to stabilize their
ground speed by varying their air speed which may then reach 5 m./sec. or more for short
periods at least.
