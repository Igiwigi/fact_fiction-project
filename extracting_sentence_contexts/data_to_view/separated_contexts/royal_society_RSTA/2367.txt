Thereafter
the intervals were 0-1 ton/square inch, until the yield point was reached. The scale
readings of both extensometers were very closely proportional to the pressure during
this period. The yield point was noticed at once, and unmistakably, by the fact that
either both extensometers would record, for the last increment of pressure, a greatly
increased extension or, as was more usually the case, one extensometer would record
an increased extension while the other registered a diminution. Some time elapsed
before the readings became stationary after the yield point was passed, but after a
period of 15 minutes the further movement was negligible in amount. The pressure
was then increased by stages of from } to $ ton/square inch and the readings of each
extensometer taken after 15 minutes had elapsed.
