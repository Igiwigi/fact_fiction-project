SEcT. 1. On s1ticated fluoric acid Gas, and subsilicated fluoric Acid.

The facts which have already been published by M. M. Gay
Lussac and THENaRD and others, appear to me to be sufficient
to prove that pure fluoric acid has not yet been obtained in
the gaseous state, and that silex, or boracic acid, is requisite
that it may assume this form. Were more evidences neces-
sary, I could advance many in point. One circumstance only
I shall mention, proving that common fluoric acid gas is per-
fectly saturated with silex. I have preserved this gas, made
by heating, in a glass retort, a mixture of fluor spar and sul-
phuric acid, for several weeks over mercury in a glass receiver
uncoated with wax, without observing the slightest erosion to
be produced.*
