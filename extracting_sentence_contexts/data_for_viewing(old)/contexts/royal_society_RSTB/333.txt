Jaksi Klich.

This is the largest, superficially, of the three dry lakes containing Cockles. Its
length is about 10 miles, and its breadth 3 miles. It differs from Shumish Kul
in being comparatively shallow. While the former must have been nearly 60 feet
deep at the time of the separation from the Aral Sea, the basin of Jaksi Klich
cannot have been more than 15 to 20 feet deep. There is not in it a distinct
series of terraces, as at Shumish Kul, bnt the shells occur in two chief deposits,
the one marking the original high level of the water, and the other forming a
band round the salt which now fills the bottom of the lake. Moreover, owing to
the fact that the shells of the outermost deposit are almost all single valves, and not
paired shells in situ, as at Shumish Kul, a good deal of mixing has become possible
amongst them, which was, no doubt, facilitated by the shallowness of the lake ; as the
banks are so flat that at the time when the lake was low it may have happened that
under a strong wind the water was driven upon the shore even as high as its original
level. Hence it results that the upper deposit of shells at Jaksi Klich is more mixed
in character than the deposits hitherto described. I will first describe the condition
of the shells found at the bottom of the lake. They occur there in enormous numbers,
being for the most part washed up into banks. A certain number of paired shells
occurs between the ridges, Their texture is uniformly thin and papery, and they are
very highly coloured, thus resembling the shells of the lower terraces of Shumish Kul,
especially those of the sixth terrace. Their length is very great, and this feature is
found in almost every individual shell. While they thus resemble in many respects
