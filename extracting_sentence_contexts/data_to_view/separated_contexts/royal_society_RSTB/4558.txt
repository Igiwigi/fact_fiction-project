In this case, the outer envelope of the organism will be comparatively thin
and still pale in colour when migration takes place. The nucleus of a prosorus which
has undergone this rapid development is shown in fig. 25. The absence of delay
between the discharges and rapidity in the carrying out of the third may be deduced
from the fact that the linin formed in the earlier discharge has not yet completely
changed from the interwoven to the reticulate condition, much less has it acquired
the final uniform appearance found in prosori developed at a lower temperature. Moreover, the later stages of the third discharge will not be finished either slowly or
completely before the nucleus begins to move, for the cytoplasm of the organism is
already commencing to migrate (not shown in the figure). This, however, is a case
of exceptionally rapid development.
