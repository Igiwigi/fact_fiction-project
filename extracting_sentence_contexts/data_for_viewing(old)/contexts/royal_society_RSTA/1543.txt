human eye many biological layers, such as the cornea, lens, vitreous body or photoreceptors, are
situated in the beam path and thus impair the image quality. The SIO images obtained showed
bright and dark structures ranging from 301m to 501m. This dimension corresponds to the size
of two to four RPE cells.


In SLO images, the macular region appears dark because of the strong absorption by the Lo |
macular pigment (excitation wavelength 488nm). By contrast, in SIO imaging, detection of

autofluorescence of the macular RPE is possible (excitation wavelength 532 nm). 3
The SIO prototype, unlike SLO, did not produce high-resolution dynamic live images. This is 1S

particularly due to the fact that the individual images to be used had to be selected from the 60
acquired images and shifted accordingly. However, an appropriate automation should be possible
by adapting appropriately fast SIM techniques presently used in microscopy application. In this
study, we limited ourselves to a feasibility study of the SIO technique.

The field of view in SIO is much smaller (about one tenth of the area) than in SLO. This is due
in particular to the geometry of our prototype in which we used standard optical components.
Yet a significantly larger field of view should be possible by a redesign of the instrument.

In this study, we demonstrated that the implementation of SIM in wide-field ophthalmoscopy
is feasible and compared our results to conventional scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO). We
demonstrated improved contrast and resolution, even though an identification of individual RPE
cells was not achieved.
