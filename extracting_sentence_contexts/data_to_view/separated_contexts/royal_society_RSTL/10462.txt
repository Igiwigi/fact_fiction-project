Burr. G. WiLpER® gives a different interpretation to these facts. He con-
siders that the ventricles in the olfactory lobes are the true lateral ventricles, that the
apertures by which they communicate with the ventricles of the cerebrum are the
foramina of MoxRo, and that the walls of the cerebrum are what he proposes to call
the © prothalami,” connected by the erura thalami with the optic lobes, and
that the ventricles which they contain are simply the forward continuation of the
third ventricle. There are many objections to this mode of interpretation ; the
ventricles in the cerebrum and their continuation backward into the third ventricle
fulfil all the requirements of the case ; but principally the stracture of the olfactory
lobes would forbid their being interpreted as cerebral hemispheres, which would have
to be the case if their cavities were to be looked upon as lateral ventricles.
