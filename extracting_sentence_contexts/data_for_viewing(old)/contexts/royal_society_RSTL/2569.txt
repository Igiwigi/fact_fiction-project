spark at the moment of disjunction than the latter. Again, twenty-eight feet of cop-
per wire were made up into a helix, and being used gaye a good spark on disjunction
with the electromotor ; being then snddenly pulled out and again employed, it gave a
much smaller spark than before, although nothing but its spiral arrangement had
been changed.

1066. As the superiority of a helix over a wire is important, to the philosophy of
the effect, I took particular pains to ascertain the fact with certainty, A wire of cop-
per 8ixty-seven feet long was bent in the middle s0 as to form a double termination
which could be communicated with the electromotor ; one of the halves of this wire
was made into a helix and the other remained in its extended condition. When these
were used alternately as the connecting wire, the helix gave by nmch the strongest
spark. It even gave a stronger spark than when it and the extended wire were used
conjointly as a double conductor,

1067. When a $hort wire is used, all these effects disappear. If it be only two or
three inches long, a spark can scarcely be perceived on breaking the junetion. If it
be ten or twelve inches long and moderately thick, a small spark may be more easily
obtained. As the length is increased, the spark becomes proportionately brighter, until
from extreme length the resistance offered by the metal as a conductor begins to in-
