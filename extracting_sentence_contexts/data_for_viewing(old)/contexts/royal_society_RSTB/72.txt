our observation.

Any electrical inequality between the two led-off points was compensated in the
usual manner by means of a SANDERSON’s potentiometer ; we used the same instru-

Our observations by the galvanometer are in the main confirmatory for the
Mammalian heart of the fundamental facts established on the Frog’s heart by the
researches of ENGELMANN, BurpoN SANDERSON, MarcHanp, and others, but with
certain reservations and amid frequent irregularities, owing to the presumably more
mobile nature of the Mammalian organ. We know already, from the observations of


ACTION OF THE EXCISED MAMMALIAN HEART. 233

Kotiiker and Mitier,* that the spontaneous systole of the Mammalian heart is
accompanied (or rather preceded) by an electromotive change ; to this we have to add
that the electromotive change is frequently diphasic, and entirely similar to the
diphasic variation of the spontaneously beating Frog’s heart. The second chief fact
relating to spontaneous action is that electromotive changes, such as ordinarily belong
