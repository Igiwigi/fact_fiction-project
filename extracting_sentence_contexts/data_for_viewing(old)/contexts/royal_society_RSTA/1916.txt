Figure 6 shows that the numerical results of the concentration and potential distributions along
the Y axis are consistent with the analysis. In figure 6b, the potentials at location close to y=

4. Simulation of the simplified reactive plasma flow in a cylinders packed bed

(a) Simulations and results

With all the validated 2D LB model components discussed previously, we developed a numerical
model to study a (simplified) weakly ionized plasma flow in a packed bed reactor. The bed
consist of a regular array of cylinders (which appear to be spheres in 2D) and it is simulated
to study the reactant consumption rate, q, under different control parameters. It is easy to realize
that the consumption rate, q, depends in principle on many parameters such as, e.g., the inflow
concentration(s), the flow velocity /pressure drop in the bed, the reaction rate coefficient (which
