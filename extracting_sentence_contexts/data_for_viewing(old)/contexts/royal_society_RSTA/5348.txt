metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) logic by Frank Wanlass of Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963.

Since those early circuits of just a handful of transistors, CMOS technology has seen exponential 3
growth, doubling the number of devices that can be integrated onto a silicon wafer according to : a
Moore’s 1965 law [2], and has led to the large-scale integrated semiconductor microchips which ig
shape our modern world. Yet, the ISFET has had limited commercial success beyond its use as a : s
glass-free stand-alone pH meter for industrial and environmental applications, partly owing to : 3
its widely reported sensor drift and sensitivity to temperature, meaning that regular calibration [2

is required, and partly owing to the fact that the ISFET system spans two phases, both solid
state and liquid, which makes experimental and theoretical work very demanding and requires a
convergence of knowledge and techniques in electrochemistry, materials, semiconductor device
physics and electronics.

The work of Toumazou & Purushothaman [3] introduced the perfect application to overcome
the ISFET’s first challenge of sensor drift and temperature sensitivity, and that was to apply
the device to the measurement of discrete changes of signal which arise from the result of a

specific chemical reaction. The work described the detection of nucleotide incorporations using Dk
ISFETs, applied both to DNA sequencing, where the time and magnitude of the pH change can 22
be used to identify sequential DNA insertions, and to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [4
detection. : x
