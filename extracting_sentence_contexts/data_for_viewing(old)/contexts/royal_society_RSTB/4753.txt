celled, growing cartilage which is responsible for the expansion of the intermediale
in a radial direction. This genetic zone or layer is three, four or five cells in
thickness ; the innermost cells gradually enlarge, and become more separated by
cartilage-matrix, and thus add to the bulk of existing cartilage ; the outer cells
continue to multiply. Parts of the intermedialia that are destined to be calcified may
undergo calcification almost immediately, so that in such cases the calcified lamina or
wedge reaches nearly to the surface, being separated from the perichondrium proper

by the thin growing zone only. |

The precise mode of origin of the genetic layer of the intermediale from the |
perichondrium is in a few cases liable to misinterpretation, in consequence of the fact
that the differentiation begins at the edges of the basalia, and does not commence
simultaneously over the whole area. In a young Galeus canis, 230 mm. in length,
the section of a vertebra between the pelvic and second dorsal fins (fig. 7, C, p. 352)
shows the upper, lower and lateral parts of the membrana elastica externa still
external, and covered by perichondrial connective tissue only. The basidorsal and
basiventral cartilages thin out almost to nothing over the upper and lower parts of
the lateral tracts, and it might be argued that in the later stages of development
these cartilages spread towards one another, between the membrana elastica externa
and the connective tissue, and ultimately meet. But careful examination of the
slightly different stages that can be seen in the vertebree of the fish in question—the
development, for instance, reaches slightly different stages in consecutive vertebra,
and even on the two sides of the same vertebra—shows that it is the “ cellular
