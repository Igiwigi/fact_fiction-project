The intensity then of the red light, for which the glass is perfectly trans-
parent, indicates the residual constant quantity, towards which the transmitted beam
continually approximates, and which is yery far from zero of intensity. But it is
evident that however numerous and complete our observations upon the law of ab-
sorption of light (without respect to colour) might be at all but the least thicknesses
of such red glass, it would be impossible to deduce from them alone the law of ex-
tinction of all those kinds of light for which the medium in question is very nearly
opake, as, for instance, the yellow or the blue, and consequently it would be im-
possible even to approximate to the primitive intensity of the compound incident
beam.

88. M. Bior, in the memoir already referred to on M. Merront's experiments, is 80
sensible of these difficulties, that he has contented himself with arbitrarily dividing
the incident heat into three kinds or qualities as respects extinction, calculating by
a Separate law for each, and assuming the sum as the representation of the trans-
mitted heat; a process by which, no doubt, almost any series of facts might be re-
presented, and which therefore gives very little information as to the real law of ex-
tinction. 89. I have spent much Jabour on the same snbject, of which it would be out of
place here to detail the results.
