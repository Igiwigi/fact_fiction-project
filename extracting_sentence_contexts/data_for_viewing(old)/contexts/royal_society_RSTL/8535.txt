58 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

draying represents the specimen of the size of nature, but T am convinced that it was
originally much longer than now. My cabinet contains two other fragments, which I
believe belonged to it; but whether they did or not, the specimen is obviously
broken off abruptly at each end. As it is, we have seven verticils of pedunculated
strobili, two or three of which strobili only appear on the surface of the shale at each node.
That this fructification has belonged to a different species of Asterophylites to Plate V.
fig. 31, appears from the fact that in the former all the strobili were pedunculate, whilst
in the latter most of the lateral ones are sessile. In this respect the latter plant seems to
resemble the Annularia densifolia figured by Excnwain®, which also agrees with the
Brooksbottom type in the presence of verticils of yery distinct scars, marking the points
from whence strobili have been detached. Fig. 32 appears to be very similar to the
pedunculated fruit originally figured by SrerxBERG under the name of Volkmannia
polystachia., The Sphenophyllites Schlotheimi of GunManÞ is also of the same type.
In my specimen each slender peduncle is about -37 in length. It is slightly thickened
where it springs from a node of the central axis, and till more s0 as it enters the
strobilus. It obyiously consists of a single joint or internode. The principal axis (&)
consists of a series of long internodes, most of which range between 1-1 and 1:2 in length,
and which are delicately but distinctly striated longitudinally ; at each node this axis
enlarges somewhat into a small lenticular disk, and attached to several of these we
