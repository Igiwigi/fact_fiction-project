regarding human behaviour, whether from social scientists or casual observers
of people in action, reveal these facts not through a confirmatory cross-cultural
checklist of observed behaviours, but, rather, by not pointing out their absence.
The reason we can safely assume that people everywhere laugh is because we
have never seen a credible account of a group of people who do not laugh (or
more importantly, cannot). Human communication consists of many universal
behaviours that vary within and between groups, including in their structures
and functions (e.g. [1-6]). Laughter provides us with an excellent case of a com-
municative behaviour that varies in its manifestations (both acoustically and
pragmatically), but appears universally nonetheless. Somewhat surprisingly,
there is limited research documenting this variation.

One reason that human non-verbal vocalizations occur universally at some
level is because they directly evolved from behaviours in our mammalian
