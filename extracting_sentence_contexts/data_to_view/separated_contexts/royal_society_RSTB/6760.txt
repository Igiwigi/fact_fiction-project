Seismo-volcanic phenomena were in fact largely ignored until 1902. To a
large extent they are still disregarded unless attention is called to them by alarming
events. From the facts at our disposal, however, there are important conclusions to be
drawn. We know (fig. 2) that since 1692 the longest period that has elapsed without
the occurrence of a volcanic disturbance somewhere in the arc, is forty-seven years;
that since 1766 the longest period of tranquillity has been twenty-eight years; and
that on seven occasions the interval between eruptions or minor volcanic activity has
been seven years or less. There is thus every reason to believe that eruptions or earth-
quakes will be renewed in the volcanic arc at no very distant date, and probably more
than once in the lifetime of the present generation.
