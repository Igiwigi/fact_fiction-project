the process, but does describe its use in other contexts completely unrelated to preserving the
dead. Strabo [10] reports the sources of bitumen common in the first century BC, and also refers
to the substance when writing about the Dead Sea, and states: The Egyptians use the asphalt for
embalming the dead. Until recently, it was thought that the trade route for the Egyptians to the
Dead Sea was only available in Ptolemaic and later times [11], but archaeological discoveries and
chemical analyses have revealed molecular evidence for trade during the earlier Chalcolithic and
Early Bronze Age periods (3900-2200 BC; [12]). Clearly, therefore, bitumen was available to the
Egyptians, but its role in mummification is poorly documented.

The dark or black colour is an unsatisfactory diagnostic for bitumen as many organic materials
when heated, aged and/or decayed naturally darken. Thus, it is possible that the dark colour of
many of the balms may be ascribed to a variety of non-bituminous sources [13]. It was only in
the early twentieth century that some chemists questioned the fact whether all black balms were
indeed bitumen [3], and from that time on, with subsequent tests of mummification material
it became clear that a variety of materials, including petroleum bitumen, were employed in
mumumification throughout its over 3300 year history in Egypt [14-27].

Given the uncertainties that exist concerning the importance of bitumen in ancient Egyptian
mummification, our aim here was to assess the true historical and quantitative significance of
petroleum bitumen in balms in ancient Egyptian mummification across the entire period from
3200 BC to AD 395. To achieve this, we have chemically investigated, using gas chromatography-
mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), the largest collection of
mummy balms to be thus analysed in modern times; the collection included 91 samples from 39
mummies (see electronic supplementary material, table S1 for complete list) of tissues, ‘resins’ and
bandaging dating from Predynastic to Roman era mummies. GC-MS with selected ion monitoring
