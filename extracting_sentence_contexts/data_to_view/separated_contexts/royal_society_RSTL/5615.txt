' the pairs (ﬆ, B), («', ÞB') as given, there are of course two values of 8 which satisfy the
; ing equation ; and calling these 9, and 9,, then 9, and 0, are said to be the sibi-
conjugates of the involution , 3; «, B'. It is easy to ee that 0,, 0, are the roots of the
equation H=0, where H is the Jacobian of the two quadrics U and U' whose roots are
(ﬆ PB), (s. Þ'). In fact, the quadric whose roots are 0,, 0, is

Q as follows; —If we imagine that A, w are determined in such manner that the inter-
