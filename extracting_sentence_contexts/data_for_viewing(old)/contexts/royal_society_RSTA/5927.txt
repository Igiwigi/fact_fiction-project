Remark 1.4 (Weak solutions as zero-viscosity limits). Lemma 1.3 has some implications
for the weak inviscid limit. In particular, uniform boundedness of the family {u"},.9 in

Il
L-(0,T; Be (2° dy) is equivalent to a bound of the form (1.12) independent of viscosity. In fact, as

in lemma 1 of [46], for Leray solutions u” € L*(0,T; L2(T*)) n L2(0, T; H1(T*)) the condition (1.12)
is equivalent to

T

where n(v) = v!/ 20s). Thus, a uniform scaling with any positive exponent of the longitudinal
structure function in the ‘inertial range’ suffices to obtain weak Euler solutions in the inviscid limit
(see Thm 1 of [46]). We emphasize that the bound (1.13) is not naively a compactness statement,
although for equations structurally similar to Navier-Stokes, lemma 1.12 transforms it into one.
