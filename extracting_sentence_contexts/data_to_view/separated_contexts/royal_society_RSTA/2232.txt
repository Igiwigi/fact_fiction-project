To match the traditional understanding, derived from Fine’s
and Suppes & Zanotti’s work, the requirement should be that, in the joint distribution imposed on
the system, the variables measuring the same property in different contexts should always have
equal values (which is achievable only if the random variables in play satisfy the no-disturbance
constraint, as discussed below). The second meaning of contextuality can be called counterfactual. It is formulated in terms
of whether an outcome of a factual measurement made in some context would have been
the same had it been made in another context. It seems that most contemporary researchers
take this counterfactual formulation as being equivalent to the joint-distributional meaning of
contextuality mentioned above (and to the ‘hidden-variable’ meaning, mentioned below). This
is apparent, e.g. in Liang et al.’s [17] comprehensive introduction to contextuality.
