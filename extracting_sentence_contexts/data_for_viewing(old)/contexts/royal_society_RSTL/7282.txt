I. On the Reaction of Permanganic and Oralic Acids.

Warr any substances are brought together under cireumstances under which they act
chemically one upon another, a change takes place which consists in the disappearance
of a part of the original substances and the appearance of an equal weight of other sub-
stances in their place. This change continues, if the circumstances remain the same, until
the whole of one of the substances taking part in it has disappeared. Its total amount
is therefore ultimately determined by the amount of that substance which was originally
present in the smallest proportional quantity. The attainment of this limit, as will be
shown, requires theoretically an infinite time, but the velocity of chemical change is 80
great that the practical limit of an inappreciable residue is in most cases speedily reached.
Owing perhaps to this fact, chemists have been led to bestow their chief attention upon
the result, and not upon the course of these changes. Occupied in investigating the
relation between the reagents and the ultimate products of a reaction, and studying the
chemical and physical properties of the thousand different substances thus produced, they
are accustomed to regard the various conditions under which every chemical change takes
place, and by which its amount is determined, chiefly as means to an end, as points to be
attended to in a receipt for preparing one 8ubstance from another,

The object of the investigation which the authors have the honour of laying before
the Royal Society in the following pages, has been to estimate quantitatively the relation
of chemical change to some of these conditions. With this view they have elected for
examination cases in which the change appeared to be of a simple character, and the
conditions affecting it few in number, and capable of being defined.
