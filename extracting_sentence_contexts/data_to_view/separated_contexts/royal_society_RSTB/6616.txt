In that section the relationship of the various lavas and dykes was not very
clear; nevertheless, it could be seen that the rocks had been greatly crushed with the
resultant deformation of the associated yellow tufts, and to a lesser extent of the lavas. In its upper part (at about 3000 ft.) the gorge has cut through a west-dipping series of
massive red rhyolites which show comparatively little sign of fracture or folding. It
may be that this is due to the fact that they lie at too great an altitude above the main
zone of disturbance. South-west of Lorienatom at the Nakinomet road turn-off, a low scarp stands up
from the plains. It faces east and the dip slope is inclined to the west at 20Â°.
