he calculation of the nonlinear response [28].
To simplify the analytical treatment, we will describe the situation where
he system—bath interaction commutes with the system Hamiltonian, [V, Hs] =
0, such that the exact dynamics becomes second order in the system—bath
interaction [29-31]. For an overdamped Brownian oscillator spectral density, the
non-commuting case can be handled efficiently using the hierarchy of equations
of motion approach [5,32].

Although the system Hamiltonian can be chosen freely, we will for definiteness
focus on a two-level system. In the basis of its eigenstates, the system Hamiltonian
is diagonal, with matrix elements 0 and ¢. The system—bath interaction causes
dephasing in the excited state, and V has matrix elements 0 and de(X), where the
fact that de is an operator on the bath degrees of freedom is indicated explicitly
by the notation (X).

Non-Markovianity 3663

In a linear response experiment, the system is brought out of equilibrium by an
external pulse, and the subsequent time evolution is probed. Non-Markovianity
during the evolution time can occur in two ways. Firstly, it can be caused by
memory in the system—bath interaction during the evolution time. A second
source of non-Markovianity are the initial correlations between the system and the
