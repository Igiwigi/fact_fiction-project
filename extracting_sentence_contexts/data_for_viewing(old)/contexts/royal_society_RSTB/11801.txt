present, and that some purple loosestrife plants were severely :
damaged. A total of 150 purple loosestrife specimens were col- these insects, 18 taxa belong to the order of Coleoptera and
lected from 8 to 10 August 2016 in five sectors on the north 16 to the order of Lepidoptera. The two other taxa belong to
shore of the lake. This shore is the most accessible and the least dis- the orders of Hymenoptera and Orthoptera. Apart from the
turbed by agricultural activities. The sectors were: (i) Maskinong√© biological control agents, the majority of these insects are


generalists and only occasionally feed on purple loosestrife.
About 10 taxa seem to more frequently use purple loosestrife
as they are more abundant on this plant than the other insects.

It was not possible to find references specifying the types
of leaf damage associated with certain insects. In fact, infor-
mation on the feeding activities of many generalist insects
which are not considered pests or nuisances is fragmentary.
In addition, some insects cause more than one type of
damage depending on their developmental stage. Within
our list of phyllophagous insects feeding on purple loose-
strife, Coleopterans mainly cause hole feeding damage (65%
of the Coleopteran taxa in our list), whereas Lepidopterans,
which often cause more than one type of damage, are more
likely to yield margin or window feeding damage (64% of
the Lepidopteran taxa in our list).
