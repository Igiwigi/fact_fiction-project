R . o| A critical point in mammalian development is when the early embryo
eview CrossMark implants into its mother’s uterus. This event has historically been difficult to

study due to the fact that it occurs within the maternal tissue and therefore
is hidden from view. In this review, we discuss how the mouse embryo is

Developmental plasticity, cell fate specification directing and coordinating this crucial event. Prior to implantation, the
