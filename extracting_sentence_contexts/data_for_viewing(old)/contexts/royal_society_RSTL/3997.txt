contractions were excited in these frogs. Operating in this manner, I have often
remarked the deflection of the needle to be increased by a few degrees, after which
the needle retrograded. When the frogs were touched several times with the potassa,
or were very much weakened, so that touching them again with the alkali no longer
produced contractions, it has, in most cases, occurred that there was no Sign of in-
creased deflection in the needle of the galyanometer. Finally, bathing the nerves of
frogs arranged in piles with acid or saline solutions, the deflection, far from in-
creasing, rapidly diminished, at least in the beginning.

These facts, with which I paused, might have appeared in some manner favourable
to the idea that the induced contractions were the effect of an electric discharge
which accompanies the act of muscular contraction : notwithstanding this I termi-
nated the chapter referred to with the following words :—< I cannot take upon me
to affirm that the question is entirely solved, and I panse here from not knowing how
or by what way to advance to solve it,” 1

The importance, however, of the fact of induced contractions thus always appeared
to me very great, and consequently I have not failed to give my strictest attention to
the study of it, and I have reason to believe, latterly, with some success. I shall,
therefore minutely describe in this memoir all the experiments that I have instituted
upon the induced contractions, and I trust the reader will excuse the prolixity of the
description.
