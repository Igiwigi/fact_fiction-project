Soc. Journ.,’ 1892, p. 906), we found that
copper lowered the F.P. of lead by 1°'17 C., and that the eutectic alloy contained
rather less than ‘2 atomic percentage of copper. The difficulty of tracing the upper branch of the curve between 85 and 100 atomic
percentages of lead is not due to the insolubility of copper in lead, for, at a red heat,
copper dissolves freely ; but rather to the fact that, between these limits, the solu-
bility changes but little with change of temperature, so that at any given temperature
the amount of solid that separates is small. It is evident that the curve must
become almost vertical for dilute solutions. At the end of each series, after removing the pyrometer and stirrer, the furnace
was closed as completely as possible, and the alloy allowed to cool slowly in a current
of reducing gas.
