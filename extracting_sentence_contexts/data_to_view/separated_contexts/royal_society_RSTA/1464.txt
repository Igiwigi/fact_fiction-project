This is not to say that such a
clue is useless, but only that it must be received with caution and considered in relation
to other evidence. By way of illustration, let us consider a pair of lines at 21200 A
and 4 1600 A, the error in measurement being certainly < 0-1 A in each. This means
that the wave-numbers are 83,333 + 7 and 62,500 + 4—i.c., the separation may be in
error by + 11 units owing to the fact that an error d? produces an error dy = d/?°. Thus the values of a doublet separation between two pairs of lines accurate to 0-1 A
may differ by + 20 units. The richness in lines of these spectra is another source of difficulty, The spectra
are not pure or even easily separable into their constituents as are ordinary are or
spark spectra, but contain lines due to the un-ionised element (though to a negligible
extent) and lines due to the element in the first, second, third, fourth, and even higher
stages of ionisation.
