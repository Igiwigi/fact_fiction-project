This appears to be a problem of great complexity,
and certain parts of what follows are distinctly speculative in character. The essence of
the complication is this : that whereas the investigation of §§ 6, 7 or 9 furnishes periodic
solutions in the neighbourhood of &, it certainly does not furnish all the periodic solutions
in this neighbourhood. In fact, it appears that the problem of finding all the periodic
solutions in any neighbourhood of &, however small, may be of the same order of
complication as the similar problem in which we do not thus restrict ourselves to a
specific neighbourhood. (i) We start by summing up the chief results of the preceding work.
