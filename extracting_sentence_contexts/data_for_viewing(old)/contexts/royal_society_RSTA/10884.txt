The Physical Condition of the Magma.—Accounts have already appeared of the
composition and structure of the dust which fell on Barbados on May 7th,* and of
the earlier falls of ashes in St. Pierre and Fort de France.t It has not yet been
possible for us to find time to make a comparative study of all the specimens which
we have .collected during our visit to the West Indies, or have been sent us by
correspondents residing there. But there are certain general conclusions regarding
the composition and structure of the materials emitted which we may draw from the
facts at present before us, which throw some light on the causes which determined
the magma to assume the form of a dust cloud.

All the samples, and notably the Barbados dust, contain a very large proportion
of crystalline fragments of volcanic minerals, often broken, but frequently showing
perfect crystalline form. Volcanic glass is present also, in fine threads and broken
splinters and in thin pellicles, coating the surface of the crystals. The same material

i oceasionally forms little rounded pellets, in which small microliths may be seen
} embedded in the glassy matrix. That the Barbados dust should be so largely of

a crystalline” nature has awakened general astonishment, especially when it is
te compared with the fine air-borne dust of Krakatoa and Cotopaxi. The glassy
