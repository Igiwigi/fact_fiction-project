We must first call attention to the important deduction which these figures reveal,
namely, that the hip is primarily represented in but 11 out of the 23 centres of its
total or absolute representation ; further that the centres, where it was observed to
move primarily, are exactly the counterpart of those where the hallux is especially
™ primarily represented. In accordance with the same fact, it is to be noted that behind
5 the fissure of Rotanpo the hip is only represented in two centres, viz., 76 and 75,
5 and that these centres are situated at the lower border of the area of representation

3S of the limb. This localisation of the hip to the lower border of the area is equally
2 3 strongly marked in front of the fissure of Roranpo, and culminates in the fact that
E the centre in which most primary representation of the hip was found to occur is the
> lowest and most anterior of the whole lower limb group, viz., centre 54.* Primary

It is evident from these figures that this infrequent movement is most represented
in the neighbourhood of centre 6, both behind and in front of the fissure of RoLanpo,
Rotation out occurs at centres :—

* Here we should remark that centre 51, although a border centre, where various parts of the body
are represented (see p. 238), is also a centre where the hip is notably represented in primary movement
(see also Table 1.).
