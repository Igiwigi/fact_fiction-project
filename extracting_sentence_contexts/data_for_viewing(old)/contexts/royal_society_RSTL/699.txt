As the weight of this dust (837 grains Troy) amounted to
no more than ;2;th part of that of the cylinder, it must have
lost no less than g48 degrees of heat, to have been able to have
rTaised the temperature of the cylinder 1 degree; and conse-
quently it must have given off 66360 degrees of heat, to have
produced the effects which were actually found to have been
produced in the experiment !

But, without insisting on the improbability of this supposi-
tion, we have only to recollect, that from the results of actual
and decisive experiments, made for the express purpose of as-
certaining that fact, the capacity for heat, of the metal of which
great guns are cast, 7s not sensibly changed by being reduced to
the form of metallic chips, in the operation of boring cannon ;
and there does not seem to be any reason to think that it can
be much changed, if it be changed at all, in being reduced to
much smaller pieces, by means of a borer that is less shirp.-‚Äù

If the heat, or any considerable part of it, were produced in
consequence of a change in the capacity for heat of a part of
the metal of the cylinder, as such change could only be super-
