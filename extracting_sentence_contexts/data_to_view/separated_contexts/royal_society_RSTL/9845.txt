On the other hand the
upper limbic arc in these animals is far from being 80 definitely separated from the
neighbouring regions of the extra-limbic mass. The anterior or four-laminated SCg-
ment of this are is, in fact, directly continuous with the exposed cortex of the vault, no
fissure, sulcus, or depression however small intervening. In connexion with this fact
it is, however, important to bear in mind the identical nature of the laminated type of
this portion of the limbic arc and the exposed margin of the hemisphere which bounds
the longitudinal fissure (sagittal). The modified limbic type of the posterior 8egment
of this arc, however, is sharply defined from the five-laminated cortex of the extra-
limbic mass by the primary parietal snleus, In the Pig and Sheep, on the other hand,
whilst the bulk and differentiation of the lower limbic arc is maintained, there is a
decided advance in this respect evident in the upper lunbic arc alsv. The anterior
portion of this arc, from its eize, actually overlaps 80 as to appear upon the upper
surface of the hemisphere, whilst a most characterisbic and deep 8ulcus, the crucial,
separates it sharply from the complex conyoluted surface of the parietal lobe.* The
oblique course of this sulcus carries it inwards to the median aspect of the hemisphere,
midway betwixb frontal and occipital pole, where it meets the subparietal suleus,
regarded by BRoca as the continuation upwards of the limbic fisxure.
