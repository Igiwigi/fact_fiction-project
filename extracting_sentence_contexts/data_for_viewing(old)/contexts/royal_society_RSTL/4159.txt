The rectus (16) is inserted in the Otter (fig. XII.), fleshy into the first rib ; in the
Dog (fig. X.) and Monkey it is inserted into the sternum, its whole length, by a ten-
dinous aponeurosis, from which arises a fleshy depressor of the first rib (16 a.). In
the Rabbit (fig. XI. 16 a.) this depressor arises from the sternum and passes in front
of the rectus ; it does the same in the Seal (fig. VIII. 15), but in this animal it forms
the first fibre of the external oblique (17), which combines with fibres to the first
(15), 8econd (15 a.) and third (15 b.) costal cartilages, to form one yast external oblique
inserted into all the ribs.

68. The triangulares sterni and the transversales combine to form one large muscle.

The triangulares sterni (19) form in the DogÂ®, the Seal4- and the Otter one con-
tinuous web with the transversales (20) ; in fact the triangulares sterni combine with
the transversales to form one extensive muscular web, the vast constrictor of the chest
and abdomen that arises from the posterior surface of the sternum, from the xyphoid
cartilage and from the linea alba, and is inserted successively into the anterior extre-
mities of all the ribs from the second to the lowest, which ribs it draws downwards
and inwards during expiration to constrict the chest and abdomen.
