the economical value of the engine, which is of course great in proportion to its
approach to 772 foot-pounds, the theoretical maximum. The sevyenteenth column
contains the theoretical duty according to Professor TnomsoN's law, viz. that the
range of temperature divided by the maximum absolute temperature is equal to the
fraction of heat converted into force by any perfect engine®.

It will be observed that the numbers in column 16, representing the work eyolyed
ont of each unit of heat, increase with the temperature and pressure of the air in the
receiver. In every example given, with the exception of the first, the economical
value of the air-engine in question is greater than that of the steam-engine calculated
by Mr. RaxkixE in his paper on the Mechanical Action of Heat. In considering
the relative merits of the engines, we must not, however, lose 8ight of a most im-
portant fact discovered by RaxkxixNg and CLavus1vs, viz. that a portion of the heat

the Dynamical Theory of Heat,” recently read before the Royal Society, Edinburgh, gives 209 foot-pounds as
the duty of an absolutely perfect steam-engine, with a range of temperature between 30* and 140? Centigrade.
