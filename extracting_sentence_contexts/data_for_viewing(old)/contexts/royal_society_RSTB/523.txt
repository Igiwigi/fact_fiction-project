Thus, although the actual amounts of gain are small, there is in every case some
gain. Determinations of nitric acid and ammonia showed that the gains were not

correlative with the amounts of either. Further, calculations showed that the
amounts far exceeded those which could be due to ammonia in the air, or to ammonia
and nitric acid in the rain; whilst the gains in the closed flasks showed that they
could not be due to combined nitrogen from the air or rain.

The author considers the results establish the fact that there is gain of nitrogen
quite independently of any absorption of combined nitrogen.

From the evidence so far it might be concluded that the gains in the meadow and
on the tower were due to electrical action; but the fifth series of experiments, in
which the soils were sterilised by heat, and then left in the balloons from July 10 to
October 6, 1885, indicate another influence. In the case of each of the four soils so
sterilised, and afterwards exposed, there was, instead of any gain, a slight loss of
nitrogen, which was attributed to the heating at the commencement. The cause of
the fixation of nitrogen had at the same time been destroyed; nor did the soils
recover the power of fixing nitrogen, either by exposure to the air of the chamber, or
when a small quantity of the unsterilised soil was added.
