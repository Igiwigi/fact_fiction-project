5 A (x, tf) =0 is imposed, i.e. the final condition on the auxiliary field being fixed. In this respect,
recall also that equation (2.7) keeps A (x, tf) unchanged.


On the other hand, the equation for the auxiliary field

a A(x, t)
ot
is obtained from equation (2.10) under the initial condition 6 P (x, t;) =0, ie. P (x,t;) being fixed.
This equation shows that the spatial integral of the auxiliary field is not necessarily a conserved
quantity, in contrast with the probability distribution function.

A crucial point is the fact that equations (2.2) and (2.11) are identical to each other. It is
therefore concluded that the auxiliary field introduced into the action for the Fokker—Planck equation
is a weak invariant associated with the equation. In this way, the auxiliary field, which used to be a
mathematical object introduced rather formally, is now endowed with a physical significance.

Canonical theory is constructed from the Lagrangian density in equation (2.6). The
canonical momentum densities conjugate to the probability distribution function and
auxiliary field are Mp =d£/0(0P/dt)=A/2 and I, =d£/0 (0 A/dt)=—P/2, respectively.
dP/dt and @A/dt cannot be solved in terms of the canonical momentum densities.
