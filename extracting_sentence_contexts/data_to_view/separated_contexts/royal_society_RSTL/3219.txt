In the 8ame manner I shall call the larger stream which debouches by Ha-

Loch Oich and Loch Lochy, is in a similar manner on a line with a peat moss, form-
ing the watershed between it and another small valley. These four cases are $0 re-
markable, that the coincidence of leyel must be intimately connected with the origin
of the shelyes; although such relation is not absolutely necessary. in as much as
the middle shelf of Glen Roy is not on a level with any watershed. Sir Laupsr
endeayours to explain this fact by supposing that when the imaginary barriers of
his separate lakes were perfect, the water flowed from that end of the glen, which is
now highest, in other words, that the drainage of the supposed lakes was in each
case in a reverse direction to that of the streams now occupying their beds. This view
implies, moreover, the strange accident, that, during the breaking down of the bar-
riers, the part that was originally lowest always remained standing, whilst a higher
part gave way; and thus the remoyal of the barrier must be supposed to have hap-
pened from the effects of some causes no ways analogous to the wearing down of the
mouths of Jakes as they ordinarily exist. The structure of these land-straits must be now described.
