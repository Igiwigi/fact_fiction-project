We have thus between the 16 functions a system of quadric

relations, which in fact determine the ratios of the 16 functions in terms of two

variable parameters #, y. (The 16 functions are thus the coordinates of a point on

a quadri-quadric two-fold locus in 15-dimensional space.) The forms depend upon six
© constants, «, b, c, d, e, f: and writing for shortness

a= Va=za-y,

= 1
FH Vab=,—{ vVa=rh—zf—zc=y.d—y.e=y+wvVa=yb=yf—y.c—zd=ze=r},

 (observe that in the symbols ab it is always f that accompanies the two expressed
© letters «, b—or, what is the same thing, the duad ab is really an abbreviation for the
5 double triad abf.cde) ; then the 16 functions are proportional to properly determined
-2 constant multiples of

& Va vb, Ve, Vd, Ve, VF, ab, Vac, ad, ae, be, Þd, be, cd, Vee, Ae,

4 and this suggests that the functions shall be represented by the single and double letter
= notation A(u, »), . . AB(u, ») . . . viz., if for shortness the arguments are omitted, then
E we have

EATB, OC, D, E, F, AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE

Z Proportional to determinate constant multiples of the before-mentioned functions
= TV vab,...ofzand y.

24. It is interesting to notice why in the expressions for 1/ab, &e., the sign con-
necting the two radicals is + ; the effect of the interchange of a; y is in fact to change
(1, v) into (=u, —») ; consequently to change the sign of the odd functions, and to
leave unaltered those of the even functions : the interchange does in fact leave 1a,
&c., unaltered, while it changes ad, &ec., into —ab, &c. ; and thus, since only the
ratios are attended to, there is a change of sign as there should be.

25. The equations of the product-theorem lead to expressions for

(where the arguments, written above, are used to denote the #0 arguments, viz. :
u+wv to denote (u+u", v+v') and u—wv to denote (u—u', v—v'); and where the
letters A, B denote each or either of them a single or double letter) in terms of the
functions of (4, v) and of (1, v') : and in any 8nch expression taking uv, v' each of them
