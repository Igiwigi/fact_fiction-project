Professor KGLLIKER, in his account of the development of dentine, describes and
figures processes extending from the peripheral cells of the dentinal pulp in developing
teeth, but he does not recognize the tube-fibril ; indeed he, as before cited, describes
the tubes as filled with fluid. M. Lex; in a paper published last year, gives a
similar description to that of M. Ku, but says that the cell-fibres are best seen
in teeth which are but little advanced in development}. Mr. HuxLey $tates that in
a 80litary instance he observed a fibre pass a short distance into the dentine\.

Both M. K6uKtr and M, Lent regard the process which they observed extend-
ing from the peripheral cells of the pulp in forming teeth, as organisms for the deve-
lopment of the dentinal tubes. The latter author, near the conclusion of his article
on the development of dentine, states, the processes of the cells are the dentinal tubes.
He observes further on, that the fact first observed by MuLLER and then by K6LLuKER,
that the dentinal tubules possess separate walls, which can readily be isolated, is
explained by the history of the development ; the wall of the dentinal canal is iden-
tical with the cellular membrane of the ivory cell.

I do not propose entering upon the subject of dentinal development in the present
communication, but shall confine myself to showing that the dentinal tubes are in the
