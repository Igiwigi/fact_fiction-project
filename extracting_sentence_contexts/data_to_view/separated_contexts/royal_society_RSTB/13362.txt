For example, in and built a time-depth recorder for deployment on Weddell
1962, Leyland C. Clark (the inventor of the oxygen electrode) seals to demonstrate that these animals can dive even deeper,
invented the ‘enzyme electrode’, which used electrochemical as individuals reached depths beyond 600 m and for longer
detection of an immobilized enzyme by a metal electrode to than 40 min [37]. In fact, this particular study may have been

‘biosensors’ are now extremely small, can cost as little as 2 animals [38]. In 2003, the first international symposium on
