As all the facts which we have accumulated on the subject of the primary repre-
sentation of movement of joints and the representation of secondary, &c., movements
are collated in a very demonstrative manner in the accompanying figs. 7 and 8, a
detailed description is hardly called for, but we cannot leave this pathologically very
important subject without dwelling for a moment on some of the more salient features
of our results.

We have already pointed out on page 163 why the shoulder, wrist, and thumb are
the joints, par excellence, in which primary movement takes place.

We will now, therefore, discuss the march, 7.e., the order in which the movements of
the various joints follow each other after the primary movement. The first and most
fundamental fact concerning the successive invasion of the various joints has already
been determined by Dr. Hucuiines Jackson, viz., that when a movement emanating
from the cortex, e.g., of the upper limb, begins in the shoulder it proceeds downwards,
involving successively the elbow, wrist, and fingers; and inversely, when it begins in
the thumb and fingers, the “march” proceeds up the limb. We are here referring
to movements presenting the characters of deliberate purpose, “voluntary” efforts,
which also can be evoked by electric stimulation of the cortex, besides being exhibited
in convulsive and epileptiform seizures, The observation of these movements as
produced in our experiments has enabled us to form certain definite generalisations
concerning the order of their march, Among these generalisations, the following
appear to us to be the most important.

1. Movement of the upper limb, commencing with the shoulder, is not completed by
