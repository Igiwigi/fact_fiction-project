(ii) Lipid estimates using colorimetric methods

Vanillin assay—The most common colorimetric approach for
measuring lipid content is the sulfophospho-vanillin assay
(SPV assay). The assay is based on an initial reaction between


sulfuric acid and fatty acid double bonds, followed by a reac- individuals and the values were averaged. The full details of 5 |
