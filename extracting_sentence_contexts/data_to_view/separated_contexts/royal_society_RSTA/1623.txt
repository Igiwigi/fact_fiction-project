electronic momentum, and that the molecule may rotate so that its own angular
momentum is either in the same or in the opposite direction to this. It would then follow
that while under are conditions both directions of rotation were possible for the BO
molecule, in active Nitrogen only one direction was possible. [A réswmé of these and other
facts is given by MULLIKEN in the papers already cited (4, 18).] ‘The physical mechanism
of this is, however, difficult to picture. Brre@x (12) has indicated several directions in
which Krarzmr’s theory disagrees with experimental data in the case of the CN doublets.
