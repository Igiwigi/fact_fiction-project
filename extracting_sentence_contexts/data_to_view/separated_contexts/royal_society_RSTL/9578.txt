\ZThere is much to recommend this theory which views molecular streams as a necessary
Ftendant phenomenon of negative discharge, but having no share in its propagation. Fe are not in a position to pronounce upon this hypothesis. The fact that resistance
5 higher with increased degree of exhaust, after a certain point is passed, s8eems to
Seo it, as this law would then admit of the simple explanation that the resistance was
\Feater because of the lack of carriers to carry the electricity into the gaseous medium. Sub this increase of resistance may come from other causes, and this single considera-
"gon does not seem to be sufficient ground for assigning to the molecular streams such
-S6pecial function in the absence of other evidence thab they possess it. On the whole, then, we are inclined to doubt whether molecular streams have any
- 1ecexrary function in the discharge.
