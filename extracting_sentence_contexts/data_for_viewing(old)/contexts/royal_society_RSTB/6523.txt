with in this paper show a similar behaviour to that of the Pennatae studied by
GeITLER (1932). In both groups only cells of a certain range of diameter are capable
of auxospore formation.

In the Pennatae it seemed that once the right size has been obtained the sexual
reproduction would take place under optimal culture conditions without any changes
of environmental factors. Thus the diatoms appeared to be the only exception to the
rule, first conceived clearly by Kiess, that in Protozoa and Algae sexual reproduction
is induced by definite changes in environmental conditions. However, GrrrLer found
that if Navicula seminulum is cultured on alkaline Knop-agar with addition of 1% NaCl
normal growth, division and decrease in size will take place but the sexual reproduction
—fusion of gametes and auxospore formation—is completely suppressed, in spite of
the fact that they were of a size which would permit auxospore formation. When
transferred on Knop-agar without the additional NaCl they readily formed gametes
and auxospores. These and experiments with low light intensity with similar results
show that apart from the “internal factor”’, a certain cell size, certain environmental
conditions must be realized before sexual reproduction can take place, but these
conditions do not seem to differ from the optimal conditions for growth and asexual
reproduction. The better the conditions for growth and division the more auxospores
were formed.

For the centric diatoms it could be shown that the optimal conditions for growth
and division on the one side and for auxospore formation on the other are different.
During a period of several months after the cells had obtained the right size auxo-
spores were formed by Ditylum, Chaetoceros didymus, Skeletonema and Melosira only in
