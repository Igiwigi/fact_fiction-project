As regards the fall of rain, the years 1848 and 1849 have been of a totally opposite
character ; for, whilst 1848 was by much the wettest, the year 1849 is the driest which
has occurred since these experiments were begun in the summer of 1844. In 1849,
the vales of Seathwaite, Langdale, Gatesgarth, Buttermere and Loweswater, have re-
ceived less rain than the average of the four previous years by 20:90 inches, 18'85
inches, 2436 inches, 20:88 inches, and 17*65 inches respectively; and 35:42 inches,
22:55 inches, 36-46 inches, 27:86 inches and 21:38 inches respectively, less than in the
excessively wet year 1848. It is a remarkable fact, that whilst from one-fourth to one-seventh less rain than usual
has descended in the valleys generally, Wastdale Head has obtained nearly halfan inch
more than its average quantity*. It will be observed that the south-west wind has
prevailed to an unusual extent in the past year. The south-west is the predominant
wind in nine months of 1849, and in the other three months it has been the same
current which brought the rain.
