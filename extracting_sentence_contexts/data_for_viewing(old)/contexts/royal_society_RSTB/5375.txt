thickness in these counties [18].

These Kentish rocks were deposited in a great basin, in which deposition was very
active, extending over the Continent [34], Dorsetshire and South Wiltshire. As we
pass W. from Kent to Dorset and then N. to Wiltshire, the formation becomes pro-
gressively thinner and contains a higher proportion of sand in the lower half, approaching
more nearly to the type of deposit constituting the strip of rocks forming the subject
of this paper. N. and E. of Wheatley the formation suddenly terminates, or rather
continues to be represented only by the Ampthill Clay. Apparently the ordinary type
of Corallian was never deposited in this direction, although fossils indicate that the
equivalents of most of it are present.

The fact that pelilithic sedimentation was here never interrupted indicates the preval-
ence of very different conditions. What where those conditions? The most satisfactory
answer is the stiller, deeper water of a landlocked sea, in which deposition proceeded more
gradually than in the open southern ocean. It was this inland sea which probably
spread round N. of the present Corallian outcrop, depositing comparatively deep-
water, thin, argillaceous sediments, which have since been denuded, together with the
Oxford Clay, from the surface of the Cotswolds and the Midlands.

The opening to the southern ocean was probably to the 8.W. over Somerset and
South-West Wiltshire. â€˜To the N.E. the sea stretched to Yorkshire, where the reappear-
ance of sands, corals and all the normal deposits indicates shallow water and the

proximity of the opposite coastline. In Yorkshire even a considerable part of the Oxford
