plasmic origin, and formed by the breaking up of a network of protoplasm. This
appearance of a network VurLLEMIN obtained by leaving sections of tubercles of

Vicia hirsuta in water for about four days. It is obvious that such treatment would
necessarily cause considerable changes to take place in the contents of the cells,
consequently any observations based upon such a method can scarcely be relied upon.

A similar origin for the Bacteroids was suggested by FRANK (10) in 1890. He,
however, was of opinion that the network consisted of an intimate mixture of
phanerogamic and fungal protoplasm, which he terms ‘“ Mykoplasm.”

From characters possessed in common by this mykoplasm and the infection tubes
and filaments, Frank concluded that they are of like origin, and are, in fact, formed
by the plant itself as a means by which it conducts to the inner cells the symbiotic
organisms (minute cocci) which are destined to grow there. In this way he explained
the absence of filaments in Lupinus and Phaseolus, for since in these genera infection
took place directly through the cells of the piliferous layer, tubes and filaments were
no longer necessary, and consequently, being organs of the plant itself, they could be,
and were, dispensed with. Throughout his work Franx insisted that the Bacteroids
are not themselves the germs, but that they contain them, and that, after the decay
and death of the tubercles, the main substance of the Bacteroids is absorbed by the
plant, whilst the contained cocci are returned to the soil.
