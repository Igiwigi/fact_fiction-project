first of all, to cause an orientation of the cells in a vertical direction, with their
anterior ends upwards. Their direction of movement is thus definitely determined,
and as they are not sufficiently crowded for the downward pull of gravity to be
effective, they begin to move more or less directly upwards. As this takes place
simultaneously in all parts of the dish, they soon become congested as they reach the
upper layers; they lose more and more their freedom of movement, and now the
conditions are such that the downward pull of gravity becomes operative and the
Euglenze begin to sink. At the same moment the cohesive force comes into play, and
a network-like cohesion figure is formed.

If the cell is a shallow one, the aggregation is more regular at the beginning, and
takes place more quickly than in a deeper one (Cf. figs. 10-12, 35, and 36). This is
explained by the fact that the upward movement brings them more quickly to the upper
surface, and that they form here, before cohesion has had time to take effect, a more
continuous layer than is possible in a deeper cell, where the upward movement is
more irregular, and cohesion begins to take effect before they have formed a homo-
geneous layer.

As we have seen previously, the aggregation is never so regular or perfect in
a deep vessel as in a shallow one. In a deep cell the movements of the Euglenz are
not so regular, owing to the longer distances to be covered, and the fact that the
upward movement is nev√©r a perfectly upright one, but always along a more or less
spiral path, which varies according to the intensity with which the movements of the
organism are directed. Consequently, their accumulation into masses or layers, and
their subsequent production of cohesion figures is more irregular (Plate 35, figs. 35, 36).
