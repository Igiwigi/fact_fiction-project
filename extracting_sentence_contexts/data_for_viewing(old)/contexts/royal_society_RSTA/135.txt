Preface 3443

The high and rapidly rising development costs and the long development times
constitute a major problem for the pharmaceutical industry, and this problem is
aggravated by a relatively high failure rate for the drug candidates in the last
trial. The high development costs are directly related to the many tests that a
drug must undergo to demonstrate its efficacy and the absence of inadvertent
side effects. The basis for using systems biology (or biosimulation) in this context
is the fact that, once a significant knowledge already exists, modelling and
simulation allow us to learn more from each individual experiment than the
currently applied methods. The reason for this is that mechanism-based models
make it possible to interpret the results of a given trial in the perspective of
already existing information or, in other words, in the context of a large variety
of previously performed experiments.

To the extent that the pharmaceutical industry succeeds in effectively
applying modelling and simulation techniques, new avenues will open for the
development of personalized drugs as well as for the treatment of rare diseases,
for which an economic basis for drug development does not exist today.
Mechanism-based modelling also presents significant advantages in relation to
both the problem of translating results obtained in animal experiments to
