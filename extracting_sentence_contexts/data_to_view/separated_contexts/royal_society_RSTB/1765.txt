But in the present case the ascension or decline of the curve is of quite another
signification. So, for instance, in the diagram B, the lowest level of the curve is found with fathers
of 25, the highest with those of 45; but the natality of these latter is not higher, but sensibly lower,
amounting to 16'1 per cent., whilst that of the other is 48°5 per cent. The cause is that, in the common
diagrams, one of the two axes—in general the vertical one—is devoted to the measure, so that the
representation of the observed facts follows one axis only. In the above diagrams both axes refer to the
phenomenon observed, thus the height of the ordinates does not signify the height of the measure. It
requires some effort on the part of the reader accustomed to the common statistical diagrams to keep in
mind this special nature of diagrams on two axes.
