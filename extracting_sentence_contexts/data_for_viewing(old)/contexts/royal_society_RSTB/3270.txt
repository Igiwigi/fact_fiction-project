In the case of the first stem, 30 centims. of the lower end and 20 centims. of the
upper end were found to be blocked at the end of the fourth day, and showed
only a slight oozing flow under a head of 2 atmospheres. The vessels in the
median portion were open, contained air and a little water, and when opened
under mercury showed a pressure not perceptibly less or greater than that of the
atmosphere.

The apparent pumping action is merely due to the stem acting as an osmometer.
Water is drawn in by the osmotic suction of the sap in the vessels through the cut
end and scraped surface more rapidly than it diffuses backwards through the nearly
completely blocked vessels at the lower end, so that ultimately a small positive
pressure is produced. The experiment in fact differs from Prrra’s on the exudation
pressure of cut branches simply in the fact that the blocking at the cut surface
is natural instead of artificial, and all the exudations observed by Pirra can be
explained as being the direct result of an osmotic absorption of water by the stem or
branch. In any case the action is a slow and feeble one, and none is shown so long
as the vessels are fully open, or when the stem is immersed in a 5-per-cent. solution
of potassium nitrate. The point to determine is whether any differential pumping
action can be detected in an actively functioning stem when intact or immediately
after its removal from the plant. Accordingly stems were cut under water at points
equidistant by 40 or 50 centims. from a single leafy branch, and arranged
horizontally under a suction of 50 centims. of water so as to draw up mercury
(fig. 7 (2) ), or placed under equal heads of water at each end. The following gives
the typical results of such experiments :—
