A was then
replaced by a full bottle, and B was used for supplying the gas while the measurements
were being taken, and so on. This method enables one to make use of all the gas from the bottles, and yet to use
only pure CO, when taking the actual measurements. As a matter of fact, the
presence of a small quantity of air in the CO, only produces a very small effect on the
measured value of the specific heat. The volumes of air and CO, which flow through
the fine tubes for a given pressure difference between their ends are practically the
same as may be seen from the calibration tables; further, the thermal capacities of
equal volumes of air and CO, are in the ratio 1 to 0°77. Hence, if as much as
1 per cent. of CO, were replaced by an equal volume of air, which would leave the
apparent value of Q unchanged, the thermal capacity would only be reduced by
0°23 per cent.
