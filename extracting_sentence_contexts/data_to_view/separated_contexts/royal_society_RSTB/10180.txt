Prior to prey pursuits, Plathemus lydia dragonflies often per-
form a rapid head movement to centre the target in its dorsal
fovea [103]. It was proposed that such head movement, together
with some thorax translation, produces sufficient motion paral-
lax for target distance estimation [103,107]. However, the fact
that some pursuits were not preceded by significant head move-
ment [103] and that the head movements produce little
translation means that parallax target ranging is questionable. Instead, this head movement has a pure foveation function
and is triggered as the target enters a specific visual receptive
field (H-T. Lin 2013, unpublished data).
