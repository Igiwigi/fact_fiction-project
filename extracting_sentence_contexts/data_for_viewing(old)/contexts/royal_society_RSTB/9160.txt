Assuming isometric scaling of the claw tip radius, larger
animals would therefore face two significant problems when
engaging claws during climbing: their claws would not only
find fewer ‘usable’ asperities, but they would also fracture
and wear more easily due to the smaller ratio of claw tip
radius to body weight. This problem is potentially aggravated
by the fact that the number of usable asperities decreases with
the claw tip radius only up to a surface-specific cut-off length,
