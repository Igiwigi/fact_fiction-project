izabilities below the resonance value. This arises because, for higher energy quanta, reson-
ance effects disappear and the detachment rate decreases uniformly with increasing
polarizability.

5. Production of O~ ions from O by other processes

5:1. Direct radiative processes. Capture of a free electron to a stable excited state with
emission of radiation is not likely to be important for the following reasons.

If the state belongs to the *P} or ?P term of the (1s)? (2s)? (2f)*3s configuration, the
phenomenon will involve capture of a / electron. For such a case the attachment coefficient
behaves like £ for small electron energies} (Massey & Smith 1936), and this, together with
the fact that the frequency of the radiation emitted (which will be very small for slow elec-
trons) enters the transition probability as v3, renders the process most infrequent for such
electrons, even allowing for possible radiative stimulation. On the other hand, if the excited
state belongs to the (1s)? (2s) (26)® configuration a radiative transition involving two
electrons would be concerned in the attachment process. The probability of this is very
small indeed.

5-2. Dielectronic attachment. If the (1s)? (2s) (2p)° configuration of O~ does not quite give
rise to a stable term the following sequence of processes could lead to the formation ofnormal
O-. An electron with small positive energy is captured to a 2p orbital, and the surplus
energy excites a 2s electron to the remaining 2 orbital. In the course of time the resulting
excited *S system will either revert to the original system by “auto-ionization” or give
rise to a normal O- ion by a radiative transition of a 2p electron to the vacant 2s orbital.
