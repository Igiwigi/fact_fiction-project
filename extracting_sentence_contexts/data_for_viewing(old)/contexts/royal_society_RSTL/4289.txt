able to addnce some curious illustrations of it.

Turning now to the more recent History of research, I shall briefly notice those
investigations which have done most towards the advance of our knowledge of the
organization and physiology of the Foraminifera ; the mere collection, description,
and systematic arrangement of new forms, without any such advance, being no more
a feature of progress, than is the building-up of an edifice, which must necessarily
fall, through the insecurity of its foundation, before it shall have been completed.

'The first series of these, made by Professor W. C. WiLLiamsox of Manchester, upon
Polystomella crispa*, not only established several important facts in regard to its
minute structure, but may be regarded as having furnished the starting-point for all
future investigations of a like kind. Among these facts were several that became of
essential value to myself, in the inquiry on which I was engaged at the saie time,
in regard to the structure of Nummulites; and served to confirm the inferences which
I had deduced from the other features of that important type, as to its participation
in the characters of the Foraminifera generally. In the course of that inquiry I made
the discoveryF, not only of a most elaborate and previously-unsuspected structure in
the shell itself, but also of a system of interseptal canals, which established a com-
munication between the inner segments and the external surface, much more direct
than that which they possess through the series of segments which form the outer turns
of the spire. The existence of this system of canals has been verified, not merely in
Nummulites by MM. p'Arcatac and Hams (Op. cit.), but also in several recent types ;
thus Professor W1LL1amsoN has detected it in Amphistegina and Nonioninaf, and more
recently in Favjasnay (which furnishes one of the most remarkable examples of it) ;
