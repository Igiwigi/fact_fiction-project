The division of
crystals into attractive and repulsive, and the reference of
the phenomena of mica to two repulsive axes, whose inten=
Sities are as 100 to 677, will also be found to be entirely
hypothetical. From this slight sketch of the present state of the science,
it will be readily seen that the process of generalisation,
however ingeniously.it has been managed, has been carried
on too rapidly, and has far outrun the progress of observa-
tion and experiment. In attempting, therefore, to establish
new and more general laws, I began my researches by laying.
a broad foundation of facts. One hundred and sixty-five
crystals were subjected to examination. In 16 of these, I have
observed the property of double refraction.
