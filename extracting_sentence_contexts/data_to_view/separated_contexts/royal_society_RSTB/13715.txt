These system types may be genomes lacking CRISPR-Cas. It has recently been suggested
driving the positive association we see between CRISPR-Cas that the capacity of type III-A systems to generate mutations
presence and ABR genes in our multi-species model for P. aer- via nonspecific DNase activity may be a way to offset the
uginosa. This result is also interesting in light of the fact that limitations imposed on genome evolution by CRISPR-Cas
both of these system types are frequently found to be encoded systems [47]. Therefore, genomes with these systems may
by MGEs. Type I-C systems occur on conjugative elements in generate diversity through mutation, rather than acquisition
P. aeruginosa and have been found to correlate positively with of DNA.
