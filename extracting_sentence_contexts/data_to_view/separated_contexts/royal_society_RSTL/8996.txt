This is shown by the greater regularity of the rhythm mani-

* It may be thought that the greater area of general tissue-mass in the larger segments than in the
smaller, and not the lesser proportional area of tube-section, is the cause of the larger segments living
longer than the smaller ones. I am led, however, to reject this hypothesis, because in Sarsia, where 8eg-
mentation entails a comparatively 8mall amount of tube-section, there is no constant rule as to the larger
segments showing more endurance than the smaller onesâ€”the conyerse case, in fact, being of nearly
as frequent occurrence. I can only account for this fact by supposing that the endurance of the seg-
ments of Sarsia is determined by the degree in which the three or four minute open tube-ends become
accidentally blocked. This supposition is the only one I can think of to account for the astonishing
contrasts as to endurance that are presented by different segments of the 8ame individual, and, I may
add, of different individuals when deprived of their margins and afterwards submitted to the same condi-
tions.
