showed the slightest mark of friction, and the cuticle of the
sides in contact was as perfect as usual.

But independent of the presumprion afforded by the soft-
ness and smoothness of the shell, and by the absence of any
arrangement of muscles which might employ it with effect
had it been strong enough to act on hard stone, it is easy to
collect facts affording ample proof that the shell cannot, be
the instrument of penetration. I have a specimen, of calca-
reous stone of extraordinary hardness, containing small
masses of silex, some of which project into the holes formed
by Saxicava rugosa, and Venerupis irus., /The lime has been
smoothly cleared around the base of these projecting portions
from situations with which the shell could not possibly have
come into contact. In another specimen, in which the lime
is mixed with a large proportion of clay, there is a small
round stratum of stone entirely argillaceous, and not one-
twentieth of an inch in thickness. The lime surrounding this
stratum has been removed by three, Saxicayz, which have
bored down upon it from difterent directions. The $hell of
