genome, we could have concluded that social interactions do
not predict gene expression levels at all; that social status, but
not social affiliation, predicts gene expression; or that social
status and social affiliation generate highly similar gene
expression signatures. Similarly, if we had focused only on
one sex, we would have missed the shared sensitivity,
but reversed directionality, of status-related pathways in
males versus females. Finally, if we had only measured gene
expression levels at baseline, we would have inferred that
social bond strength has little relevance to immune gene regu-
lation, when in fact it is a much better predictor of variation
in the response to immune stimulation than dominance
rank. While this complexity presents a challenge—additional
dimensions we did not explore, including developmental,
tissue and cell type differences, are also likely to be impor-
tant—it also illustrates the potential for high-dimensional
genomic data to capture heterogeneity in the signature of
social relationships that is impossible to infer from single
measures. Indeed, our results suggest that, even in the blood,
social regulation of gene expression must be the consequence
of multiple upstream signalling pathways. Future studies thus
have the opportunity both to test existing hypotheses about
the role of glucocorticoids in social environment-associated
