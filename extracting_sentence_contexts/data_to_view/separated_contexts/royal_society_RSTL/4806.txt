When the formulz of inorganic chemical compounds are considered, even a super-
ficial ohserver is struck with the general symmetry of their construction ; the com-
pounds of nitrogen, phosphorns, antimony and arsenic especially exhibit the tendeney
of these elements to form compounds containing 3 or 5 equiys. of other elements,
and it is in these proportions that their affinities are best satisfied ; thus in the ternal
group we have NO,, NH, NI,, NS,, PO,, PH.,, PCl,, SbO,, SbH,, SbCl,, AsO.,, AsH,,
AsC1,, &c.; and in the five-atom group NO;, NH,O, NH,I, PO;, PHI, &c. Without
offering any hypothesis regarding the cause of this symmetrical grouping of atoms, it
is sufficiently evident, from the examples just given, that such a tendency or law
prevails, and that, no matter what the character of the uniting atoms may be, the
combining power of the attracting element, if I may be allowed the term, is always
satisfied by the same number of these atoms. It was probably a glimpse of the ope-
ration of this law amongst the more complex organic groups, which led Laurent
and Dumas to the enunciation of the theory of types ; and had not those distinguished
chemists extended their views beyond the point to which they were well supported
by then existing facts, â€”had they not assumed, that the properties of an Organte
compound are dependent upon the position and not upon the nature of its single

* atoms, that theory would undoubtedly have contributed to the development of the
science to a till greater extent than it has already done; 8uch an assumption could
only have been made at a time when the data upon which it was founded were few
and imperfect, and, as the study of the phenomena of substitution progressed, it gra-
dually became untenable, and the fundamental principles of the electro-chemical
theory again assumed their 8way. The formation and examination of the organo-
metallic bodies promise to assist in effecting a fusion of the two theories which have
80 long divided the opinions of chemists, and which have too hastily been considered
irreconcileable ; for, whilst it is evident that certain types of series of compounds
exist, it is equally clear that the nature of the body derived from the original type is

essentially dependent upon the electro-chemical character of its single atoms, and

Snot merely upon the relative position of those atoms. Let us take, for instance, the

*compounds formed by zine and antimony; by combination with 1 equiv. of oxygen
=the electro-positive quality of the zinc is nearly annihilated ; it is only by the action
=of the highly oxidizing peroxide of hydrogen that the metal can be made to form a
Jery unstable peroxide; but when zinc combines with 1 equiv. of methyl or ethyl,
Its positive quality, 80 far from being neutralized, is exalted by the addition of the
Spositive group, and the compound now exhibits such intense affinity for the electro-
Snegative elements as to give it the property of spontaneous inflammability.
