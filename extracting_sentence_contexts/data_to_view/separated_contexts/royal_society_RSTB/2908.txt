Further than this, they do not always
reach across, or only do so for a certain portion of their full extent. Whether any
great importance need be attached to the difference in the form of the interlamellar
junctions in these two species is doubtful. The difference is probably due to the fact
that Corbula levis, having a greater capacity for forming subfilamentar tissue than

Corbula gibba, is enabled to develop complete septa, whereas the latter is not. The
condition in Corbula gibba may, therefore, be the more primitive, or, on the other
hand, it may indicate a defection from the septal condition. Solenide.
