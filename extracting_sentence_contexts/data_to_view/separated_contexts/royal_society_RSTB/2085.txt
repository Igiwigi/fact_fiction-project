MR. FRANCIS DARWIN ON STOMATA. 615

stomata. The fact that I failed to get a secondary maximum at the blue end of the
spectrum is hardly an argument against the correctness of Koxt’s assumption that
the assimilative rays are effective in opening the stomata, since it is well-known to
be difficult to demonstrate the blue maximum except by ENG@ELMANN’s bacterial
method. That the rays of low refrangibility should be effective in producing
opening is certainly a striking exception to our knowledge of the action of light on
movement, and I agree with Kon that his result is the best argument which we
possess in favour of what may be called the nutritive theory of stomatal machinery. ~ The following explanation of the action of the different parts of the spectrum is
very tentatively put forward.
