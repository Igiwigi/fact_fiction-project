difference between the theory I have ventured, and those previously existing,
cannot be offered than the views they respectively give of such facts as these.

551. The instances in which sulphuric acid could not be passed through
baryta, or baryta through sulphuric acid$, because of the precipitation of sul-
phate of baryta, enter within the pale of the law already described (380. 412.),
by which liquidity is s0 generally required. In assuming the solid state of 8ul-
phate of baryta, they became virtually non-conductors to electricity of 80 low
a tension as that of the voltaic battery, and the power of the latter over them
was almost infinitely diminished.

552. The theory I have adyanced accords in a most satisfactory manner
with the fact of an element or substance finding its place of rest, or rather of
evolution, sometimes at one pole and sometimes at the other. Sulphur illus-
trates this effect very well. When sulphuric acid is decomposed by the pile,
slphur is evolved at the negative pole; but when sulphuret of silver is decom-
posed in a similar way (436.), then the sulphur appears at the positive pole ; and
if a hot platina pole be nsed 80 as to vaporize the sulphur evolved in the latter
ease, then the relation of that pole to the sulphur is exactly the same as the rela-
tion of the swme pole to oxygen upon its immersion in water. In both cases the
element evolved is liberated at the pole, but not retained by it ; but by virtue
of its elastic, uncombinable, and immiscible condition passes away into the
surrounding medium. The sulphur is evidently determined in these opposite
directions by its opposite chemical relations to oxygen and silver; and it is to
such relations generally that I have referred all electro-chemical phenomena.
