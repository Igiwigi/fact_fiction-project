neuroimaging data, it will be natural to investigate the modelled activity by exploiting some of the
same methods used to track the dynamics of integration/segregation of information in empirical
data such as time-evolving modularity and dynamic cartographic analysis.

Dynamic cartographic analysis characterizes the dynamical contributions of individual nodes
towards balancing integration and segregation (figure 7a). This analytical approach has revealed
that individual brain regions show significant changes in their relative within- and between-
module connectivity over time [42]. Some fronto-parietal, striatal and hippocampal regions
notably spent a greater proportion of the time acting as ‘connector hubs’ promoting global
integration, as estimated by high cross-modular connectivity. However, it is actually another class
of regions, termed ‘peripheral nodes’, which dominates the dynamical cartographic landscape:
peripheral nodes were characterized by low-to-medium within-module connectivity and low
between-module connectivity. This indicates that that the majority of brain regions are in fact
