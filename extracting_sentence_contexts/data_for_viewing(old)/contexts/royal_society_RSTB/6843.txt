produced by the driving off of water (at several stages), but did not comment on the
fact that their conclusions clashed with the views of Barnes and Winchell. Neither
did they discuss the ratio of the percentages of ferric to ferrous iron in their analyses;
in the unheated amphibole it is 0-54: 7-99, while in the brown hornblende produced
by heating it is 9-70: 0-17. There has clearly been either oxidation or auto-oxidation.
During the heating no precautions were apparently taken to prevent oxidation of
amphibole or possible released hydrogen by the air. Kézu, however, by heating
common hornblende in nitrogen at a pressure of one atmosphere, produced reddish

brown hornblende in which the extinction angle was reduced to zero.

In Montserrat it is clear that the red-brown type of hornblende results from some
change affecting either green or brown hornblende. The fact that the red-brown
amphibole occurs only in rocks that show clear signs of oxidation from external
sources* suggests strongly that the change of common hornblende into red-brown
hornblende, with Zac approximating to 0°, has not been fully elucidated by the
experimental studies. Thirty-three years ago Lacroix attributed the formation of
red-brown hornblende (occurring in Martinique rocks reddened by superficial volcanic
oxidation) to the effects of volcanic oxidation on green and brown hornblende; he
produced a similar result by heating such amphiboles in air (Lacroix 1904, p. 532).
These observations appear to have been overlooked by recent writers.

It should be mentioned that in Barnes’s very extensive experiments the brown
hornblende produced by heating in air is never described as having a reddish tinge.
K6ézu and Kennedy, however, used the term “reddish brown’. Dr Kennedy was
