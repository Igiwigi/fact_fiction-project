The link between

inking and cleavage opening in antigorite is supported by the correlation of microstructurally
observed kinks and macroscopically observed brittle deformation [4,5,8,41]. However, recent
deformation experiments conducted on aggregates of antigorite at elevated pressure and room
temperature reveal that kinking is localized to the damage zone near fractures that formed during
brittle failure [1]. In fact, prior to macroscopic failure, the mechanical behaviour of antigorite
aggregates is marked by (i) mostly non-dilatant deformation prior to failure in the brittle regime
[1,2], (ii) significant shear dissipation and the absence of volumetric dissipation during cyclic
loading at stresses below the brittle failure strength [1], and (iii) the ubiquitous presence of
shear microcracks oriented along the basal (cleavage) planes of antigorite in the ductile (semi-
brittle) regime, preferentially oriented at around 45° from the maximum compressive stress [2]. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that intragranular shear microcracking,
equivalent to shear delamination along the cleavage plane, is a key deformation mechanism in
antigorite, at least in the low-temperature regime. Although shear delamination is analogous to,
and can be produced by, dislocation glide in the basal plane (e.g. [42]), delamination need not be
accommodated by dislocations in antigorite, where intracrystalline slip is likely accommodated
by spatially extended defects like shear cracks.
