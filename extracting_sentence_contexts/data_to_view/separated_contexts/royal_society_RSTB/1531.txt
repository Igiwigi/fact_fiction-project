Although
ovulation and menstruation may be coincident, this is certainly not always the case
(man and monkey), and one is forced to believe that these two processes are governed
by two or more laws, which do not always operate at the same time. The discharged Follicles of M. rhesus compared with those of the ITuman Female. Attention is drawn to the fact that, in the human female, some discharged follicles
contain a blood clot, whereas some do not. :

In monkeys, during the non-breeding season (J. rhesus) no blood clot is present
in newly-discharged follicles, while in the breeding season (7. spectrum) a blood ciot
is present in them. It is shown that the presence of a blood clot in monkeys is not
due to the coincidence of ovulation with menstruation, and it is suggested, on the
other hand, that its presence is due to the coincidence of ovulation with the breeding
season. <A further suggestion is then made, that the presence or absence of the
blood clot, in the discharged follicles of the human female, is due to the coincidence of
ovulation with a favourable time for conception. It is pointed out that women are
not always in a condition to breed, and that it is possible the oceurrence of periods
during which they do not conceive, may justly be compared with the non-breeding
times of monkeys,
