The source of the impurity turned out to be the tube containing
the nitrate of silver, which was probably becoming affected by acid carried by the gas. The tube was suppressed, and a tube containing copper potassium tartrate, carried on
pumice, substituted. The use of this tube entirely removed the odour of H,S which
the gas quitting the generating bottle had to some extent, and, in fact, the gas passed
on quite free from smell. It is improbable that VII. is affected appreciably by the amount of oxide of nitrogen
present, A very small quantity would have sufticed to impart the odour. Hyprocgun VII.â€”W = 0-2350 gramme.
