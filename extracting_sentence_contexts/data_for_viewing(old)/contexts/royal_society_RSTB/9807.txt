that it is presented to lay people, who might defer to it too
readily. An important consideration when reviewing the role
of forensic evidence in the courts relates to the nature of
the scientific evidence and the degree to which it influences
the jurors—and there are three levels we can consider.

Introduced through expert evidence are sciences which
require an empirical analysis of the data; ‘a method that relies
on scientific instrumentation to provide quantitative data that
can mathematically represent results’ [42, p. 4]. Examples of
this are drug analysis, toxicology or DNA analysis. These are
distinct for their quantitative approach to evidence and the
fact that the result can often be codified, either as a ratio or as
a number. The perception of the lay public is that these sciences
are largely infallible: there is little room for human error, and
objective results can be furnished by a computer. This is a
position which is increasingly undermined with recent chal-
lenges to the validity of DNA analysis in court [43] or, for
example, the increasing challenges to the identification of new
psychoactive substances.

The forensic sciences that rely fundamentally on compara-
tive analysis: ‘a method that involves the comparison of an
item of evidence of unknown source against an item of
known source or origin’ [42, p. 4] cause different issues.
