angle with it. In the case of Ornithoptera poseidon and others, there are two dark
velvety patches on the forewings, which owe their appearance partly to the angle at
which the scales are attached to the wing, but chiefly to the fact that the scales form
rows which run at right angles to the nervures instead of parallel, as do the other scales.

(b) Shape and Configuration of the Scales.â€”These factors are frequently the
cause of the change of colour seen on varying the position of the wing. In this way
Morpho cypris, the shape of whose scales is convex, may be made to vary from dull
purple to electric blue. The well-known appearance like shot silk, shown by Apatura
iris, LINN., which causes it to seem bright violet in one direction, but black in the
opposite, is said to be due toa similar reason.
