T have, for the sake of homogeneity, introduced into the formulz the quantity @ (=1),
but this is a matter of form only,

The functions [3], [4], &c. have been spoken of as prime; they are 0, in fact, as far
as they are calculated ; and that they are 80 in general rests on the assumption that for
a polygon of a given number of sides, there is but one form of relation: if, for instance,
in the equation [12]=0, which is the condition for a proper dodecagon, the function
[12] could be decomposed into rational factors; then equating each of these factors to
Zero, we should have 80 many distinct forms of relation for a proper dodecagon. T

elieve that the assumption and reasoning are valid; but without entering further into

is, I take it for granted that in the general case the functions [3], [4], &e. are in fact

rime. But the coefficients Ã¾, y, 3, or 6, c, d, instead of being 80 many independent
Sibitrary quantities, may be given as rational functions of other quantities (if, for
Instance, the two conics are circles, radii R, r, and distance between the centres a, then
8, y, 3 will be functions of R, r, @): and it is in a case of this kind quite conceivable that
He functions [3], [4], &c., considered as functions of these new elements, should cease
EN be prime functions. In fact, in the case just referred to of the two circles (the
Sriginal case of the Porism as considered by Ftss), the functions [4], [6], &c., which
<a to'a polygon of an even, number of sides, appear to be each of them decom-
Joable into two factors: the memoir contains some remarks tending to show @ priori
hat in the case in question this decompoxition takes place. I was led to examine the
