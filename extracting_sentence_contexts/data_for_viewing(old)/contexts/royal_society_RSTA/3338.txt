that for waves of constant vorticity we can alternatively fix Q and choose y to be the continuation
parameter. This choice can be beneficial for overcoming some limitations of this approach and

computing waves which belong to new parts of the bifurcation curve. :2

Considering the validation of our algorithm, in [15] we have illustrated the performance of : =
the corrector step to solve (5.2), for which we employ a Newton algorithm. Furthermore, we have :§
performed the same error tests on examples for which we have a priori knowledge of the analytical ‘>
expression of the solution. : =

The computed waves in this section demonstrate different characteristics below and above a : S
critical vorticity, which is ycrit * —2.971, for the choice of parameters given in (4.7). We emphasize : a
the fact that we obtain, also, some new qualitative results, compared with [17]. : S

The appearance of two turning points in Q and a monotonically increasing wave height along : =
the solution curve is observed for all constant vorticities that are larger than y,it. The value of y 18

does have a significant influence on the stagnating waves. Indeed, the results presented in figure 6
display the following characteristics for the wave profile:

— The wave height decreases, as the vorticity y gets larger.
— The shape of the wave changes with the vorticity; the crest becomes sharper and the
trough wider and flatter as the vorticity increases.

The above procedure does not compute a maximal wave with a sharp angle at the top for
