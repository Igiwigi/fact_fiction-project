From the two values k and k’ the loss of heat of the calorimeter
during the whole of the experiment could easily be calculated, for the rise in
temperature during the actual heating was uniform. If the current passed during 7
intervals, each equal to T, and if — % and —k’ denote the rates of cooling during the
first and last periods, the loss of heat during the m intervals was 4m(k-+ 4%’). A
small correction was necessary owing to the fact that the observed values of k and k’
did not correspond to the temperature of the calorimeter at the beginning and end of
the second period. We have now to examine shortly how far errors in the estimation of the cooling
correction may arise. Nrwron’s law of cooling is known to be approximate only.
