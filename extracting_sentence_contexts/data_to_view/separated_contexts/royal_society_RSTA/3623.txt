Thus correlation can be created or destroyed or
reversed by selection. The above illustrations, hypothetical though they may be, will suffice to indicate
how entirely dependent correlation is upon selection. We must look upon coefficients
of correlation, in fact, as just as much the outcome of selection as coefficients of
variation, standard-deviations, or even the mean size of organs. No selection can
take place, in the sense in which it has usually been understood to take placeâ€”i.c.,
by a change of mean and of variability, without at the same time the means,
variabilities and the correlations of all correlated, but not directly selected, organs
being varied. This is true whether the non-selected organs be initially correlated or
not among themselves.
