The pigmentary system of the higher Crustacea has a very ancient, definite, and
uniform origin. It is laid down as a series of centralised chromatophores having
constant relations to other organs.* The chromatophores of this primary system
are already coloured, and the pigment shows periodic as well as light-induced
movements of contraction and expansion, yet the pigments produce practically no
optical effect. The ultimate chromatophore-system of the adult animal overlies and
masks this primary system which, nevertheless, continues to persist and function.

The chromatophores of Hippolyte are not confined to situations where their
pigments may be optically effective. They occur not only in the skin, but invest
the liver and gut and follow the muscles in their courses.

These facts, though not necessarily invalidating the hypothesis of protection, make

imperative the more difficult task of inquiring whether the chromatophore-system
of so typically a sympathetically coloured animal as IZippolyte has not some quite
unsuspected function.

The first possibility which we began to consider, and with which this section is
concerned, was whether the chromatophores of Hippolyte may have some photo-
