be added that, as bodies are constituted in nature, the force required to produce the
original displacement in plastic bodies will be small as compared with that required in
solid bodies. Viscosity and semi/{uidity are terms which only express similar proper-
ties of bodies, but indicating that still smaller forces only are required to produce a
given displacement in viscous or semifluid bodies than in plastic ones. The limiting
case is that of perfect fluidity, in which both the forces of original displacement and
those of restitution are indefinitely small. In these latter cases the tangential cohesion
is necessarily 8mall, and such also (as bodies are usually constituted) will be the normal
cohesion. At the same time the power of resisting compression of yolume may be very
great, as in fact it is in nearly all masses not technically designated as elastic masses.
In other words, the normal elasticity, with reference to pressure, may be of any magni-
tude, while the tangential elasticity equals zero.

It will be observed that T have here spoken of a body as held in a state of constraint
by external forces, but without any kind of dislocation which should destroy its conti-
nuity or injure its 8tructure. If, however, the external forces should be sufficiently
increased, the structure of a vitreous or crystalline mass, or that of any mass possessing
hardness and brittleness, will be destroyed by a pressure greater than its power of resist-
ance can withstand ; or the continuity of its mass will be destroyed by any normal tension
greater than the normal cohesion, or, again, by any tangential tension greater than the
tangential cohesion. 'The normal tension would then produce an open fissure; and the
tangential tension would cause one particle of the mass to slide past another, but without
