280 DR. FRANK HORTON ON THE ORIGIN OF THE

(1) The emission from calcium is increased when traces of oxygen are present ;

(2) After much use a Wehnelt cathode becomes “exhausted.” The oxide gradually
disappears and the metallic surface of the supporting strip is perceptibly
altered, probably owing to the action of the liberated calcium or oxygen ;

(3) When lime is heated so that no current goes through it there is no large
emission of electrons.

The only one of these which appears to the writer to be conclusive is the
last. The first result follows from the fact that the emission from lime is much
greater than that from calcium,* and it is not necessary to attribute the emission to
the process of oxidation. The second result supports the view that electrolysis
takes place, but does not support the theory further than that; but from the third
result it appears that electrolysis is essential in order to obtain a large electronic
emission from lime.

The experiments described in the present paper were performed to test the
“chemical action” theory of the working of an oxide cathode. FREDENHAGEN
experimented with a mixture of lime and magnesia which is a better conductor than
lime alone. The experiments about to be described were made with Nernst filaments
which consist of a mixture of oxides having a much larger conductivity than the
mixture used by Frepennacen. It has been found by Owent that these filaments
