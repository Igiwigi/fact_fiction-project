Similarly, the speed and accuracy with
which a set with numerosity of 6 can be distinguished from a
set with numerosity 4 are the same as the speed and accuracy
with which a numerosity of 60 can be discriminated form a
numerosity of 40. The dependence of discriminability solely
on the objectively measured ratio has two consequences
called the size effect and the distance effect. The size effect
refers to the fact that the discriminability of given numerical
difference depends on the size of the two discriminanda. Thus, for example, a difference of 2 is easily recognized
when the discriminanda are 4 and 2, but the same difference
is unrecognizable by the non-verbal system for representing
numerosity when the discriminanda are 52 and 50. The distance

effect refers to the fact that the discriminability of two numeros-
ities depends on how widely separated they are.
