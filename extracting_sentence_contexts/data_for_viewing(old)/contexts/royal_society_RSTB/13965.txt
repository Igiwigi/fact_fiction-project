To understand the lack of genome streamlining in sexual
populations, it is necessary to reconsider the two steps of suc-
cessful TE amplification. First, a TE must infect a host, but in
order to increase in frequency, it must also replicate within
the host (at least once). In asexual populations, cells with
streamlined genomes die during the infection step, thus
immediately blocking further TE amplification. With recom-
bination, however, TEs can infect new lineages without risk
of immediately killing the host, irrespective of the level of
genome streamlining. Although subsequent transposition
may still render the host inviable, the host cannot prevent a
TE from infecting its genome, thus allowing the TE to repli-
cate at least once. The fact that genome streamlining does
not occur in these sexual populations suggests that streamlin-
ing in asexual populations evolves to prevent transposition
between genomes, and not transposition within genomes.

3. Discussion

Here, we have presented an in silico coevolutionary model of
TEs and host genomes. The model reveals an interesting
interplay between genome streamlining (the amount of
