These analyses also support the idea that dissipation
range fluctuations are dominated by KAWs. Recent observations have motivated intensive research into electron scale turbulence both
theoretically and numerically [120-127]. However, the underlying physics remains controversial
primarily owing to the fact that the available observations are few and theoretical and numerical
work has been extended to those small scales only recently. One issue concerns the scaling of
the magnetic energy spectra down to and below pe. Sahraoui et al. [75] first reported a power-law
cascade f<2* down to fp,, where a clear spectral break is observed, followed by another power law
close to f;:* (fp, is the frequency in the spacecraft frame corresponding to the electron gyroscale
when the Taylor frozen-in flow assumption is used).
