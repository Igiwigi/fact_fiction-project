For instance, if the true causal structure
is x-uâ€”w for some (possibly unobserved) confounding
factor u, then w covaries with x, and thus the derivative
dw/dx is usually non-zero, as we noted above. But the causal
derivative 6w/Sx is zero everywhere, for there is no directed
path from x to w. This reflects the fact that one cannot change
the fitness value by intervening on x in this case (for their func-
tional relationship is spurious). We will return to this topic at
the end of this article. The quantitative nature of each cause-effect relationship is
modelled by a structural equation that determines the value of
the effect variable from those of its parents, such that x;=
fi PA()), uj), where PA(x;) is the set of all parents of x; and 1;
is an unmodelled error term.
