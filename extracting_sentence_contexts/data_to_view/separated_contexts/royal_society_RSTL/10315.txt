GILBERT, AND M. T. MASTERS,

that the result was the establichment of a Å¿ew freer-growing, and the retardation of
more meagrely-developing species, we have obviously, in the fact of the predominance
of plants of greater feeding and growing capacities, conditions 8uited to the gathering
up of more food, even with the same supplies ; whilst, this being the case, the compara-
tively small increased 8upply would not be without its influence. In other words, the
increased produce on the plot, and the increased accumulation of nitrogen, silica, and
mineral constituents generally, is nob to be referred exclusively to the increased gupply
of constituents from without, but largely to the special conditions favouring the develop-
ment of species having a greater power of food collection, and therefore a greater power

of growth.

9. Ammonia-salts (800 lbs. per acre), and mixed mineral manure, including potass ;
Plots 11-1 and 11-2. ' :

It has been shown that on plots 9 and 13, with the mixed mineral manure (in-
cluding potass), and 400 Ibs. of ammonia-salts per acre per annum, the herbage became
extremely prominently gramineous, and was, upon the whole, coarse and stemmy.
