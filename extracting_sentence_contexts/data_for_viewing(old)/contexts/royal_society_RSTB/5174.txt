lasted into the early Kainozoic. The country was probably then at only a moderate
elevation above the sea, for a gulf that crossed central Tibet in the Upper Jurassic still

* According to M. Deprar, a belt of vast ‘‘ Decken ” overthrusts, comparable to those claimed for the
Alps, extends across §.E. Szechuan, near the southern great bend of the Yangtze (about 103° E., 26° N.)
through the country N. and E. of Yunnan-fu, Kwei-chow and northern Tongking ; and the compression and
disturbance in that belt is equal in intensity to that of the Himalaya, and it is the only belt in eastern
China with a Himalayan structure. According to M. Deprar, the movements were of very recent dato.
He says (1915, p. 81): “‘ L’Asie sud-orientale entitre du Tibet au Pacifique et au golfe du Bengale est done
entrainée dans un mouvement d’une ampleur énorme, peut-étre en voie de ralentissement & Vheure
actuelle, mais qui & une époque trés récente était encore trés rapide.” Our observations indicate that the
disturbed belt was further N. in western and central Yunnan than M. Derrar suggested, and the date
of the movement was earlier. We may also remark that the essential facts shown in the section of the
Kiao-ting Shan, the chain on the overthrust belt of which M. Derrat’s description is most precise, may
be explained by overfolding with less extensive thrust planes than are required by his interpretation.

existed in the Cretaceous, though it was smaller in size and shallower. The Cretaceous
sea certainly reached the coasts of southern India and covered an extensive area in
western Burma; but China was mainly, if not wholly, land.*

The second stage was that of the Himalayan uplifts ; as they uptilted the Nummulitic
limestones along the southern flanks of the Himalaya they were later than the Middle
