462 MR. E. J. REED ON THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF

moments experienced by this vessel are 12,000 foot-tons for still water, and 43,600 foot-
tons for a wave-crest, while the maximum sagging-moment in a wave-hollow is 48,800
foot-tons. The shearing-forces haye also been found to have the following approximate
maximum values:—In still water 210 tons, on a wave-crest 555 tons, and in a waye-
hollow 640 tons, while aground it equals 3666 tons. 'The comparative conditions of
strain of the ship under these different circumstances can be fairly determined by com-
paring these figures. It is also interesting to remark the different manner in which
changes of the attendant circumstances affect the strains of the two classes of ironclads
represented by the © Minotaur ' and the © Bellerophon.” The reader can trace these for
himself; I would simply call attention to the fact that when aground and supported at
the extremities the maximum bending-moments bear very nearly the same proportions to
the products of the lengths and displacements, notwithstanding the very different distri-
bution of the weight in the two ships. This similarity is mainly due to the fact that the
centres of gravity of the fore and after bodies in the two ships are very nearly the same
part of the length of these bodies distant from the bow and stern. For example, in the
* Minotaur ' the centre of gravity of the fore body is 116 feet distant from the bow, and
the fore body is 201 feet long, these quantities being very nearly in the ratio of 3 to 5;
while in the © Bellerophon ' the centre of gravity is 90 feet from the bow, and the length
of the fore body is 144 feet, the ratio between these quantities being nearly the same as
before.

Our third example is drawn from the * Victoria and Albert,” in which ship the centre
