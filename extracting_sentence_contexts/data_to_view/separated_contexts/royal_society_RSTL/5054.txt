the bands seen in an experiment due to the Baron von Wrzepe, There may, it will
perhaps be said, have been a fissure parallel to the first surface, s0 as to separate a
thin plate; and the interference of the two streams of light reflected respectively on
the upper and under surface of this plate may have produced the bands observed. But various phenomena attending these bands are irreconcilable with such a SUpP0-
sition. Towards the edges of the crystal, where flaws did in fact exist, bands of the
same nature as Von WRepe's were actually observed. But these had an appearance
totally different from that of the others. The dark bands of the interference system
were more intensely black and better defined than those of the other s8ystem, and
were very variable, depending as they did upon the thickness of the plate by which
they were formed, whereas the bands belonging to the first system were always the
Fame.
