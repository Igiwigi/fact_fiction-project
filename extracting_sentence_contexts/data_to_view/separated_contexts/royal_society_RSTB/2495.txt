The second, published in 1900, dealt with the Angiosperms (“ Morphology of
Central Cylinder in the Angiosperms,” ‘Canadian Inst. Trans.,’ vol. 6). It is proposed to deal in the present memoir with the remaining Vasculares, and to
draw such theoretical conclusions concerning vascular plants in general as seem
justified by the facts described in the present and former articles. It will be
convenient to consider first the Filicales, and subsequently the Lycopodiales and
Gymnosperms. The investigations recorded here have been rendered possible by the kindness of
many botanists in supplying material otherwise inaccessible to the writer, and
acknowledgment is made of these favours in connection with the various groups.
