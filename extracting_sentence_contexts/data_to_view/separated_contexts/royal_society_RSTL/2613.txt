This is the state of true hybernation. Lyoxer has stated his belief that the respira-
tion of pupz is entirely suspended for a very great length of time during winter ; but
his experiments with the pupz of Sphinx ligustri, which led him to this statement,
and which were made by merely covering the spiracles with s0ap-water, and watch-
ing with a microscope for the rising of bubbles, do not seem sufficiently precise and
accurate to warrant the conelusion. For the purpose of ascertaining this fact, I
made a number of observations in the year 1829 upon the pupa of the Sphinx, and
have since repeated them under different cireumstances. There are different degrees
of respiration at the same season of the year in pupze of different insects, which appear
to have reference to the conditions in which the insects are placed in their natural
haunts. When the Sphinz ligustri, which passes its winter in the earth, is examined
in October or November, it gives most decisive proofs of respiration in the produc-
tion of carbonic acid gas; but this is much smaller in quantity than that which is
produced at the same period in a given time, and under similar circumstances, by
the pupa of Pavonia minor, STEPH., which passes its winter in the open air, and is
more readily exposed to the varied influences of the seasons.
