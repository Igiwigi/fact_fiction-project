cally adopted in morality and ToM studies. However, it is worth
pointing out that this term is used to refer to a variable set of anatom-
ical regions that includes AG, lateral occipital cortex, STS, SMG and
pMITG. Often activations that are entirely contained in one of these
regions are described as being in the TPJ, which seems unnecessarily
vague and creates potential for incorrect reverse inference.

â€œTo rule out activations due to executive processing demands, Binder
et al. [15] eliminated contrasts that had greater difficulty for the con-
dition of interest relative to that of the control condition. Because
abstract conditions frequently have greater difficulty /reaction time,
many such contrasts were excluded, resulting in an increase in bias
towards concrete semantics, which stemmed from the fact that
there were many more studies of concrete concepts to begin with.
