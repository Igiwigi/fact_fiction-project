278 PROFESSOR TYNDALL'S OBSERVATIONS ON THE MER DE GLACE.

time. But this is not the case. In accommodating itself to the change of inclination,
the glacier breaks and is fissured in the manner described.

The change of inclination last mentioned, s0 far from marking the limit at which
transverse crevasses begin to be formed, is sufficient to produce chasms of great magni-
tude, and in most inconvenient numbers. Higher up the glacier, transverse crevasses
are produced by a change of inclination from 3 10' to 5%. If this change be accurately
protracted, the mere inspection of it will illustrate more forcibly than words can do the
absence of the power of viscous yielding on the part of the ice.

Looked at broadly, then, two classes of facts address themselves to the attention of the
glacier investigator ; one entirely in accordance with the idea of viscosity, and the other
as entirely opposed to it. 'The affirmers and deniers of the viscous theory have perhaps
been influenced too exclusively by one or the other of these classes of phenomena. 'The
analysis of the facts gives the result, that where pressure comes into play we have the
evidences of apparent viscosity *, but where 7ension is active we have evidences of an
opposite kind. One of these classes of effects is as undeniable as the other, and hence
the true theory of glaciers must render an account of both.

When the mountain snow is first moistened, it becomes more coarsely granular ; these
granules abut against each other, and hold air and water in their interstices. But as
successive layers press upon the mass, the granules are squeezed more closely together;
rupture and liquefaction, succeeded by regelation, take place at the points of abutment ;
