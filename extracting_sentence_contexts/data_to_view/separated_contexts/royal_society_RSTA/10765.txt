The chill at 650° is very similar to the
preceding, and as far as we can see it is free from bars. Another chill at 650°, very
slowly cooled before the chill, has many more bars, but they are small and thin, and
may, we think, be attributed to the chill not being sharp enough to arrest all further
change. In fact, the bar pattern is so slight in all the above-mentioned ingots, that
we think it almost certain that the alloy passes through a region of temperature in
which it is really a uniform solid, as in the case of Sn 21. Sn 22. S.e. chill at 600° (not reproduced).
