HorLar, who has made researches into the developments and homologies of these
bones, has come to the conclusion that the bone considered by CUuvIER to be the mastoid
in Reptiles and Vishes, is in fact the 8quamosal. A comparison of the skull of the Cro-
codile with that of Zatteria seems to support this view, inasmuch as CuyigR's © partie
6cailleuse du temporal ” of Crocodiles appears merely as a segment of the zygomaticÞ,
with which it is reunited in Hatteria. Very remarkable is the form of the os guadratum (0) and its junction with the hind
part of the pterygoid (7); both bones are much dilated, forming a vertical plate composed
of two laminz, the lamine being immoyeably united by suture, the quadrate being the
anterior plate, the pterygoid the posterior.
