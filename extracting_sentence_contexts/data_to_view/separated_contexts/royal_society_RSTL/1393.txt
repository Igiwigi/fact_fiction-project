Most of the arguments which I have used to show that the
bones in Yorkshire, cannot | have been accumulated by the
action of one, or of a succession of floods, apply with equal
force to the cave at Gailenreuth, and it is unnecessary to repeat
them. The above description of the cave at Gailenreuth, extracted
from RosENMULLER, and confirmed by my own observations

* It is a curious fact, that of the numerous caves in the calcareous hills near Mug-
gendorf, that flank the yalley of the Weisent-stream, those on the north chain con-

other caves on'the Continent, of which it is superfluous here
to say any thing farther, than to subjoin a list given by
M. Cvvier of the most important of them, and to refer to
the fourth Volume of his Animauz fossiles, for farther de-
tails taken from the authors by whom these caves have been
described. The caves alluded to are as follows : :

Brunswick, on'the east border of the Hartz forest, and de-
scribed by LeBNITZ.
