Now it is precisely the peculiar property of hybernation,
that the circulation through the heart is not interrupted, although the respira-
tion be snspended. This topic is reseryed, however, for a subsequent part of
this paper. It is simply stated in this place as a fact, to show that the painful
feelings supposed to arise from suspended respiration in hybernation, do not
exist,; and that the difficulty of supposing a suspended state of the respiration
with an unimpaired sensibility, is, in this manner, entirely remoyed. The sensorial functions, on the other hand, are nearly suspended. This is
proved by the suspension of respiration, which is immediately renewed, for a
time, on exciting the animal.
