cavities (e.g. parallelepipeds, cylinders and spheres), and for many practically im-
portant shapes only rough estimates are available. Unrestricted methods having an
accuracy (say) of 1 % will thus have considerable value.

2. Relaxation methods were in fact based originally upon the ‘membrane analogy’
of the plane-potential problem, and their terminology reflects that circumstance. It
has therefore seemed appropriate in this paper to treat membrane vibrations as the
primary problem, and to bring electromagnetic oscillations under discussion by
analogy, notwithstanding that this inverts their order in respect of practical importance.
Accordingly Section I derives the governing equation for a membrane having any
specified distribution of density, and applies the relaxation technique to find, for a fixed
square boundary, the gravest normal mode and frequency. The exact solution is known
as regards a membrane of uniform density (Rayleigh 1926, § 197): Section I gives
approximate solutions obtained by L. F., for comparison, with a use of the technique
developed in Part VIIB. It also exemplifies the similar treatment of membranes non-
uniform in density, showing that the general case is little harder: here no exact solution
is available for comparison, but there is no reason to believe that the accuracy is less.
