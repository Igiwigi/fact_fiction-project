CCIX.—A, Q


114 MESSRS. WALTER ROSENHAIN AND P, A, TUCKER. secondary tin is much larger, while it has segregated into masses which compare in
size with the primary tin in the same section; it would seem, in fact, that in this
case a considerable proportion of the secondary tin had formed around the primary
tin present, or had coalesced with it. In this alloy, as in the 16 per cent. alloy, it
thus appears that the transformation which takes place at 149° C. involves the
rejection of tin from the solid solution.
