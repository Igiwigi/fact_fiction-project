interior a mere vestige of the archenteric cavity is visible.

From the sections of Specimen P we prepared a wax-plate reconstruction-model
of the primitive knot and its immediate environment, at a magnification of
400 diameters. The superficial aspect of this model displayed the blastoporic
aperture as an asymmetrical cleft-like aperture of relatively considerable width
(it measured over 60 millims. in the model). This cleft was not transverse, but
somewhat oblique, and bore traces of an original crescentic disposition convex
posteriorly, though the overhanging dorsal lip which actually defines it is not now
even, but irregular in its contour. This dorsal lip projects backwards, and it is its
free margin which is seen shaved off in fig. 29. From this latter figure, together
with figs. 86 and 37, the asymmetry of the blastoporie aperture may be realised,
as also the fact that it is the apparent right (actual left) horn of the crescentic
opening which is prolonged deeply to form the commencement of the imperfect
blastoporic canal. The other horn and the remainder of the crescentic aperture
form little more than a deep groove continuous with the canal at its mouth. In
the slightly older Specimen E the ecrescentic character of the aperture has entirely
disappeared : the opening is still somewhat asymmetrical, but appears as a somewhat
irregular, single, and approximately medial, depression, though its vestibule is wide
and bears faint traces of its original character (cf. fig. 34).* This wide dorsal
opening leads into a blind depression (ef. text-fig. 11, p. 74), representing the lumen
of the archenteron. Fig. 41, Plate 9, shows a photomicrograph of a section through
the primitive knot of Specimen E immediately in front of the apparent blind ending
of the blastoporic canal. Here, again, the ectoderm is seen in process of differentiation
over the dorso-lateral surfaces of the knot, as if by a method of overgrowth. It is,
