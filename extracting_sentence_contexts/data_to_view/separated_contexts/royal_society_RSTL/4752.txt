Scrors{ saw the lava of 1819 in the Val del Bove moving down a consider-
able slope at the rate of a yard a day, nine months after its eruption. It had, he
adds, the appearance of a huge heap of rough cinders ; its progression was marked
by a crackling noise due to friction and straining, and © on'the whole was fitted to
produce any other idea than that of fluidity. In fact,” he continues, © we must
represent to ourselves the mode in which the crystalline particles 'of lava moye
amongst one another, rather as a sliding or slipping of their plane snrfaces over each
other, facilitated by the intervention of the elastic (?) fluid, than as the rotatory
moyement which actuates the molecules of most other liquids.” | It is generally con-
formable to this view that we find in Hamiuron's Campi Phlegroi (fol. 1. 38. Note) the
curious remark that some lava is 80 incoherent, or whilst flaid has 80 little viscosity,
that in issuing from the volcano (Vesuvius) it has appeared * farinaceous, the particles
Separating as'they forced their way out, just like meal coming from under the grind-
stones.”

From all this it is quite clear that the 8eeming rapidity of the parts of a glacier,
or the slowness of its motion, cannot be taken as the slightest evidence of its moving
otherwise than as a fluid, contending with the rigor of the parts which include and
resist the moving force, which is truly hydrostatic though limited in its exercise. It is manifestly futile and unphilosophical to seek one cause of motion'in a lava
which, like that of Vesuvius in 1805, must have described as many hundred feet in a
minute as that of 1614 from Etna '\probably did in a yearh; for the mean daily
motion of the latter during ten years was three feet ; but toward the end of that time
it must evidently have had for a long period 'an average motion of one-half or one-
quarter of this, and therefore below the observed mean movements of certain glaciers.
