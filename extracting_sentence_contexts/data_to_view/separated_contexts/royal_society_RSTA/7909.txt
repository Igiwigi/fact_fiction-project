It is then easy to understand why the process of
elastic recovery is impeded by the changes which take place during the decay of tension. That this explanation is the correct one is shown very strikingly by simply re-stretching
the “relaxed ’’} fibre. It is found then that it once more recovers its original length
quickly when the stretching force is removed, and, in fact, recovers more and more
rapidly as the re-stretching process is repeated. Both recovery in water and re-
stretching, therefore, have the effect of reversing or destroying the new-formed side-
linkages, with the final result that the fibre is left permanently easier to stretch, but
with its speed of elastic recovery more or less unimpaired. Fig. 6 and Table II show

* There is just a suggestion that the prolonged action of water on keratin results in some hydrolysis of
the main-chains (Asrpury and Woops, ‘ Nature,’ vol. 127, p. 663 (1931) ), but this point requires further
investigation and will be reported on later.

t In order to avoid the repeated use of an adjectival clause, it seems convenient to adopt the adjective

“relaxed” to deseribe fibres which have suffered decay of tension through being held stretched in water
or other reagents.
