Kézu, however, by heating
common hornblende in nitrogen at a pressure of one atmosphere, produced reddish

brown hornblende in which the extinction angle was reduced to zero. In Montserrat it is clear that the red-brown type of hornblende results from some
change affecting either green or brown hornblende. The fact that the red-brown
amphibole occurs only in rocks that show clear signs of oxidation from external
sources* suggests strongly that the change of common hornblende into red-brown
hornblende, with Zac approximating to 0°, has not been fully elucidated by the
experimental studies. Thirty-three years ago Lacroix attributed the formation of
red-brown hornblende (occurring in Martinique rocks reddened by superficial volcanic
oxidation) to the effects of volcanic oxidation on green and brown hornblende; he
produced a similar result by heating such amphiboles in air (Lacroix 1904, p. 532). These observations appear to have been overlooked by recent writers.
