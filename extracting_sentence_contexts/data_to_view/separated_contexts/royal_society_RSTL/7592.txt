It appears, therefore, that it is necessary to increase greatly the
mechanical force of the explosion to obtain the desired result with chloride of nitrogen,
in order to compenzate for the deficiency or absence of some peculiar power possessed
by the explosion of the fulminates. Again, in the case of nitroglycerine, we have a
body which explodes with a development of force quite as great as that of the strongly
confined fulminates, yet the detonation of gun-cotton could not be accomplished by the
explosion in close contact with it of a quantity of nitroglycerine more than sixty-five
times greater than the amount of mercuric or slver-fulminate required for that purpose. Do not these facts appear to demonstrate the existence of a remarkable difference in the
character of the concussions or vibrations produced by exploding the two materials? I yenture to offer the following as being the most satisfactory explanation which
occurs to me of the remarkable differences just pointed out in the behaviour of different
explosive agents. The vibrations produced by a particular explosion, if synchronous
with those which would result from-the explosion of a neighbouring substance which is
in a state of high chemical tension, will, by their tendency to develope those vibrations,
either determine the explosion of that substance, or at any rate greatly aid the disturb-
ing effect of mechanical force snddenly applied, while, in the case of another explosion
which produces vibrations of different character, the mechanical force applied by its
agency has to operate with little or no aid; greater force or a more powerful detonation
