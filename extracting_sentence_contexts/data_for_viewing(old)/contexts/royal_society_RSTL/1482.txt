the same, whether these nine lights were placed s0 as to cover,
and pass through each other, or not.

But I afterwards found means to demonstrate the very great
transparency of flame by a still more simple experiment.
Suspecting that the only reason why bodies are not visible
through a sheet of vivid flame is, that the light of the flame
affects the eye in such a manner as to render it insensible to the
weaker light emitted by, or reflected from the objects placed
behind it, I conceived that a very strong light would not only
be visible through a weak flame, but also (as all transparent
bodies are invisible) that it might perhaps cause the flame
totally to disappear ; to determine that fact, I took a lighted
candle at mid-day, the sun shining moderately bright, and hold-
ing it up between my eye and the sun, I found the flame of the
candle to disappear entirely. It was not even necessary, in
order to cause the flame to become invisible, to bring it to be
directly between the eye and the body of the sun ; it was suffi-
cient for that purpose to bring it into the neighbourhood of
the Â«un, where the light was very strong : even in a situation
in which the light was not s0strong as to dazzle the eye 80 much
