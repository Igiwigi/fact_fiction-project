Received March 18,—Read May 13 and 27, 1852. « THE mere description of appearances even of the interior structure, still less of
the exterior surface of an animal, without the deductions which they legitimately yield,
is of comparatively small value to the philosophic naturalist ; for of what value are
facts until they have been made subservient to establishing general conclusions and
laws of correlation, by which the judgment may be safely guided in regard to future
glimpses at new phenomena in nature*?”

If I prefix this admirable exposition of the true aims of anatomical investigation
to the present essay, it is that I may justify, by the highest authority, the course which
I have taken in considering what of new facts it contains, as of snhordinate import-
ance to the reasonings which may be based upon those facts; in making its scope
more morphological than zoological. The morphology of the Cephalous Mollusca is a subject which has been greatly
neglected. No Savicxy has determined the homologies of their different organs, and
80 furnished the only scientific basis for anatomical and zoological nomenclature.
