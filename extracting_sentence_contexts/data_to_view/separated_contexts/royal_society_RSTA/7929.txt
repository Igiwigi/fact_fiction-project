Without further tests it is not yet clear
whether light is essential in this experiment ; at the moment, the results would appear
to be analogous to those obtained by SpeaKman (loc. cit., p. 382) with de-aminated hair. The acidic dichromate apparently reacts with the amino-groups so as to prevent their
participation in the process of permanent set. Support is given to this explanation by
the fact that wool dyed with eosin also showed a similar behaviour.*
Variations along the Fibre Length.—In a series of super-contraction tests of the roots,
middles, and tips of Cotswold wool fibres marked variations were found in proceeding
from one end to the other. The super-contraction curve for normal roots is shown in

* [Note added in proof, October 10th, 1933.—Further work (Woops, ‘Nature,’ vol. 132, p. 709, 1933),
has now shown that Cotswold wool fibres, after immersion for only ten minutes in a saturated solution
of potassium dichromate, give rise to a well-defined curve of super-contraction, but have lost almost
entirely the property of being set by steam in the elongated form.]

fig. 12 (A), the mean super-contraction for 10 minutes’ steaming at 50% extension
being 4-5%. For the middles and tips the corresponding figures were found to be
67% and 13-99%, respectively; that is to say, those parts of the fibre further removed
from the roots showed less tendency to permanent set, just as do de-aminated fibres and
fibres treated with potassium dichromate or eosin.
