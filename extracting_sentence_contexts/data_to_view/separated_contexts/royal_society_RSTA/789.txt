The solution of Schrédinger’s


equation is |) = e UMH(2—h) yy, ), where e~@/MH(b-h) = Up,—1, is a unitary operator; unitary
operators have the property that their conjugate transpose is equal to their inverse. In this model, the overall Hamiltonian was specified in C4, but the structure of this
space was such that a part was separable, in C? @ C2, and a part was not separable (note
that, in physics, it is typically the case that separability concerns C? @ C2, but the structure
of the problem we consider lends itself better to C2 @ C2). In fact, most QPT dynamical
cognitive models are specified so that they have a part which is separable, that is, it can be
written as C2 @ C?, and a part which is not separable, so that it can only be specified in
C*. There is a reason why this is the case: most of the current, interesting empirical findings
which are driving the application of QPT in cognition involve a binary decision. It makes
sense to model binary decisions in a two-dimensional space (such as C?).
