So far
as I can judge, the appearance of this exogenous growth possibly corresponded with the
period at which the leaves ceased directly or indirectly to produce further increase in the
number of the vessels of the medullary cylinder. I can discover no reason for 8upposing
that the number of the vessels of that cylinder subsequently received further additions,
or that any further enlargement took place in the diameter of the cylinder, I can only
account for the development of the exogenous layers by supposing the existence of some
equivalent of a cambium-layer surrounding and parallel to the cylinder. The fact of
these growths taking place as T have already described is beyond all question. The only
debatable points refer to the source whence these exogenous layers were derived, and
to the relations which they bear to the similar structures of other plants. Professor M*Nap, who objects to my views on this point, lays much stress upon the
distinction between a layer of © meristen ” tissue and a cambium-layer.
