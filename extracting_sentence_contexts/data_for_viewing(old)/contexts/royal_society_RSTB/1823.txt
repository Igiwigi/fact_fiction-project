436 MESSRS. G. MURRAY AND V. H. BLACKMAN ON THE

Tae Coccotirus AND RHABDOLITHS OF CRETACEOUS AND OTHER Deposits.

Since Watticu in 1861 pointed out the identity of the coccoliths observed by
Hvux.ey and himself, with the structures described by EaRenperc and Sorpy in
chalk, it has been a generally accepted view that the coccoliths are to be found in
abundance in cretaceous rocks. Owing, however, to the want of a clearly-defined
standard of structure, the name coccolith is now given by geologists to a number of
very diverse objects; in fact, it has come to be applied to any small, perforated,
plate-like body, either consisting of calcium carbonate or of some presumable
replacement of that substance. Geologists have in this matter departed from the
view of Huxuny, derived from his interpretation of the structure of coccoliths in the
deep sea deposits.

We have shown that these coccoliths are the constituent plates of C. pelagica and
C. leptopora, and that they possess a very well marked type of structure, viz., two
limbs joined together by a central collar. The real test of a coccolith is thus its
double structure. Judged by this standard, by far the larger number of bodies
described by geologists as coccoliths, have no claim to be so considered. There is, in
fact, no evidence that they are derived from even allied organisms.
