ion temperature and density in the hotspot and shell of the LMJ scale capsule, over the time
period where fusion occurs. It can be seen in this figure that the hotspot pR is greater than
0.3 gem, while the ion temperature is around 3.5 keV. The pR in the shell is around 2gcem?
(and the ion temperature is much lower at around 350 eV, as expected). The hotspot areal density
in the LMJ-scale simulation is notable, as 0.3 gcm~? is sufficient for ignition and matches the
target areal density for the NIC ignition design [24]. However, actually igniting such a capsule
requires higher temperatures; the analytic model discussed in §2 estimates that such an areal
density would require an ion temperature of around 5.5 keV to ignite, which is in agreement with
the temperatures targeted during the NIC from hydrodynamic assembly (it was expected that the
ultimate temperature for such a capsule would then reach 10-12 keV, since significant self-heating
would occur once ignition took place) [1].

These specific results themselves are not particularly impressive—it is the fact that such results
have been achieved in this new low-instability regime which is of note. Much higher gains than
those quoted here have been reported at lower energies in previous simulation work. The novel
aspect of this work is that such results have been achieved in this new regime, where instabilities
are expected to be minimized. The expected 1D nature of implosions in this regime means that,
while the gain itself is not high for 1D simulations, there is good reason to expect closer agreement


between experiment and 1D simulations than is typical. It is therefore hoped that gains of similar
magnitude to those presented here could be achieved experimentally, which is not true of typical
high gain 1D simulations.

In addition, it is important to note that the use of 1D simulations means that high accuracy
