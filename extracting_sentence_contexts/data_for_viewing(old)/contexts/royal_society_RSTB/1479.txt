Subjoined are some of the quantities of CO, that diffuse through the cuticles of ¢}
respective surfaces, expressed in cubic millimetres per hour and square centimetres,

The lower “cuticle” thus never exceeds the upper in permeability by more th
five times, in spite of the fact that the lower is usually riddled with stomata covered
only with a film of glycerine jelly, while there are but few of these weak spots on th
upper cuticle. This shows that the actual permeability of the cuticle of the lower
surface, apart from the stomata, is never as great as five times that of the uppe
cuticle. I hope to make use of this later.

In no case does the author give any diffusion results with a cuticle perforated with
stomata taken before as well as after the coating with glycerine jelly, so that a real
quantitative estimate of the effect of this latter might be made.

In the second part of the paper, from experiments on the respiration and assimila
tion of a piece of leaf, the author comes to the conclusion that the amount of osmosi
through the cuticle, calculated from the above data, is quantitatively insufficient te
