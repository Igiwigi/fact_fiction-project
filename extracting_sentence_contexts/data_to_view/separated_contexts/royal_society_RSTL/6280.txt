We also observe, that in the case of the
former the successive absorptions approximate more quickly to a ratio of equality, In
5 fact the absorption produced by 4 inches of the vapour was sensibly the same as that
z produced by 5. But reflections similar to those which we have already applicd to oletiant gas are also
: applicable to ether. Supposing we make our unit-measure small enough, the number of
rays first destroyed will vanish in comparison with the total number, and for a time the
fact will probably manifest itself that the absorption is directly proportional to the
density. To examine whether this is the case, the other portion of the apparatus,
omitted in the general description, was made nse of. IK is a small flask with a brass
cap, which is closely screwed on to the stopcock &.
