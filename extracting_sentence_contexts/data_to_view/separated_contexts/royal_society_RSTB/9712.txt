All this remains underexplored. Third, our current theoretical understanding of ‘who
helps whony’ is poor. The fact that offspring are the recipient
of help (which then is modelled as a fecundity-benefit for the
parent) is probably based on nonlinearities in fitness curves
of the type presented by Whitlock et al. [78], or based on
asymmetries in reproductive value and social value of the
type presented in Rodrigues & Gardner [80]. But as the
curves, reproductive value, and social value change with
age, and effects of help in general are not invariant with
respect to time if a social group experiences demographic
changes [32], it appears that the field could very usefully
work towards integrating ontogenetically determined asym-
metries with analyses of selection to improve a partner’s
fecundity or survival. We therefore hope that conclusions
will not be ‘all over the place’ long into the future.
