The only other sense of which definite
evidence was obtained in the cages was that of touch, The female, when ovipositing,
explored most carefully the shoots, leaves, or twigs with the tip of the abdomen
before actually laying an egg; in this process the first pair of legs also seemed to be
used as a sense organ, for the female always vibrated them rapidly on the surface of
the leaf or twig under examination, making a quite audible tapping. It was
concluded, though on very slight evidence, that a suitable food-plant was recognised
by its scent, then the front legs were used for testing the age of the foliage, the
female being very averse to laying on anything but soft young leaves and shoots, and
finally the exact position for the egg was discovered by the sensory organs at the tip
of the abdomen,

The next subject to be dealt with concerns the sexual life, and specially the
possibility of selective mating in polytes. This is a difficult subject to deal with, for
the reason that so little can be obtained in the way of definite facts on which to base
conclusions, while, in addition, the observer is likely to be influenced in the
interpretation of the few facts at his command by numerous small unrecorded and
even subconscious observations absorbed in the course of the experiments. For this
reason, perhaps, though numerous accounts are given of the courting habits of
butterflies, no opinion is usually ventured as to their general bearing. In the present
case it seems better to place on record the opinions formed during the experiments,
