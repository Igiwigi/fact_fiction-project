the induced currents tend to move are parallel throughout the whole mass ; and

therefore, as there is no part by which the return of the current can be, carried on,
no current can be formed.

2332. Before proceeding to the explanation of the other phenomena, it will be
necessary to point out the fact generally understood and acknowledged, I believe,
that time is required for the development of magnetism in an iron core by a current
of electricity; and also for its fall back again when the current is stopped. One
effect of the gradual rise in power was referred to in the last series of these Researches
(2170.). This time is probably longer with iron not well annealed than with yery
good and perfectly annealed iron. The last portions of magnetism which a given
current can develope in a certain core of iron, are also apparently acquired more
slowly than the first portions; and these portions (or the condition of iron to which
they are due) also appear to be lost more slowly than the other portions of the power.
If electric contact be made for an instant only, the magnetism developed by the
current disappears as instantly on the breaking of the current, as it appeared on its
formation ; but if contact be continued for three or four seconds, breaking the contact
is by no means accompanied by a disappearance of the magnetism with equal rapidity:
