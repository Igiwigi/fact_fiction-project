For the few stars for which
« has been determined experimentally the effective temperature T, agrees with the
* colour temperature ” or temperature determined by the shape of the energy-curve
for the continuous spectrum. The exact relation between colour-temperature and
effective temperature remains for future investigation,* but provisionally it is assumed
that the observed correlation of type of spectrum with colour-temperature indicates a
correlation of type with effective temperature. On the other hand for stars of given type there are smaller but well-marked variations
of spectrum—variations in relative intensity of pairs of lines—which have been found
to be correlated with absoute luminosity.+ It is generally agreedt that this correlation
must in fact be a correlation of spectrum with the second parameter, surface gravity g. The explanation of the observed correlations in its broad outline is due to Sana,§
who proposed the theory of the high-temperature ionization of the elements and traced
its consequences. Variations of spectral type are due to variations of ionization and
excitation consequent on variations of temperature—actual temperature, not necessarily
effective temperature.
