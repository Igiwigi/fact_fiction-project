when «, 7 are both negative,

If now we substitute (p+1)*+(p+1)—2(p+1)% for s in A, I say that the resulting
value will be positive whatever positive value be given to (p+1); in fact, if we write
p=#—1, and make o=—»#+2r+—15, 80 that A becomes a function of the twelfth degree
in », this function is what the discriminant of the equation in a, y becomes when we
have e=7=»; but in the antecedent Lemma it has been shown that this discriminant is
only negative when the two equal quantities s or 1, or, which is the same thing, when »
