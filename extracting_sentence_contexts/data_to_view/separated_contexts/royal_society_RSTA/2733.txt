Alloy
_41-07 remained homogeneous after the above treatments, and also after cooling from
300° to 100° over a period of two weeks, and being maintained at 100° for a further eight
days. :

Discussion.—The figures given in the collected tables are taken directly from the
above work. As will be appreciated from the data in Tables XXTIT and XXIV, a
few of the alloys showed slight inverse segregation in spite of the fact that they were

sand castings. But the liquidus and solidus and the « and @ solid solubility curves
respectively are so close together that very little error can have been introduced on
this account. The cross-section of alloy 39:43 in Table XXIV, quenched from 628°,
showed traces of the $-constituent except in the immediate centre (inverse segregation).
