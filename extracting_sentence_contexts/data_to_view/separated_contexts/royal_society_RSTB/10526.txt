Given that both EFP and eIF5A must enter the ribo-
some through the E site, the dissociation of E-site tRNAs may
serve as a signal of slow translation that requires intervention. Importantly, while EFP is non-essential in many bacteria,
elF5A (and the enzymes that catalyse its modification) is essen-
tial in yeast and higher eukaryotes. This requirement may be
due to the fact that a far higher percentage of eukaryotic pro-
teins have polyproline motifs (10%) or because it functions
more generally. In a ribosome profiling study of E. coli cells lacking EFP,
we observed strong pauses (more than 10-fold above the
average ribosome density) at roughly half of the Proâ€”Pro
motifs [59]. These pauses were also observed in bacteria
lacking EpmA and EpmB, the enzymes responsible for
post-translational modification of the conserved lysine resi-
due.
