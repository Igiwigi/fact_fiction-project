Overall, the impact is therefore not significant on the sea-ice
evolution in the model. This does not contradict [23]: waves can affect sea-ice mobility, but their
impact remains limited in time and space. The fact that we still find an increase in low drift speed
means that the updated neXtSIM rheology [33] used here compared to [23], with more resistance
to convergence, does not prevent waves from affecting sea-ice deformation.

4. Discussion and conclusion

We have compared the wMIZ extent in a coupled wave-sea-ice model with observations from IS-
2, showing satisfying results for our reference simulation. We have suggested two quantitative
metrics, So, and S19, for assessing whether the modelled wMIZ extent is underestimated or
overestimated.
