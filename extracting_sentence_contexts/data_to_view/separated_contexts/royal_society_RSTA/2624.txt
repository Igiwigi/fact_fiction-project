Its total emission values as well as the calculated possible savings in the
three scenarios are given in electronic supplementary material, table S1. Our calculations showed
possible fuel savings of 5.07-20.28 kg and cost savings of 2.89 US$ to 11.56 US$ per nautical mile
in the three scenarios for the oil tanker. For the Prem Divya, we calculated the figures for a fictional journey from Bahrein to Calcutta
of around 2700 nautical miles (one way). The calculated possible fuel savings for this journey
are between 13689.0 and 54756.0kg, meaning CO2-emission savings between 42846.6 and
171356.3kg and cost savings of 7802.7 US$ to 31210.9 US$. The detailed results for the three
scenarios are given in electronic supplementary material table S2.
