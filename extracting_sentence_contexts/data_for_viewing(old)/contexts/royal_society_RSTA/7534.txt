represents quite generally the decrease of the total potential energy of the system (namely,
the elastic energy of the material and the potential energy of applied forces) when all sources
of internal stress and inhomogeneity within & are given a small displacement dé,. The energy
F,0£, is available for conversion into kinetic energy or dissipation by some process not
considered in the elastic theory.

Tt will be seen from the foregoing that a singularity with a prescribed /7 on and outside
= can be regarded as arising from either (i) a suitable distribution of S,, within ¥ or (ii) a dis-
tribution of body forces f° within &. The /;5 are equal to the fictitious forces (36) associated
with §,,. /, is the same for (i) and (ii). The representation (ii) fits into normal elastic theory
where surface and body forces are regarded as the sources of the stress field. On the other
hand (i) is a more natural representation of the singularities of physical theory, since they
do not in fact arise from body forces.

The requirement of §5 that surface tractions should be applied to a free surface of the body
is rather unrealistic. It is certainly not satisfied, for example, when the body containing the
singularity is a specimen in a tensile testing machine. We can, however, regard the specimen
plus testing machine as a single body to which the results of this section may be applied.
(Mechanical details can be accommodated to this picture, e.g. a bearing surface is a region
where the shear modulus but not the bulk modulus vanishes.) Stresses are applied to the
singularity by a weight rigidly connected to the machine (body forces), by tightening
a screw (internal stress) or through a knife-edge (applied stresses according with the
requirements of §5).

It should be noted that there will be an image force (in the generalized sense) on a
