were yoided by a common outlet#. Concluding also by inference that the
mammary glands as well as nipples were wanting, and strengthened in his
belief of the oviparous nature of the Monotremata, by some accounts from
New South Wales of the discovery of the eggs of the Ornithorhynchus-, he
subsequently separated the monotrematous animals altogether from the Mam-
malia, and characterized them as a class intermediate to Quadrupeds and
Birds. (Bulletin de la Socicts Philomathique, tom. viii. p. 95—Annales des
Sciences Nat. xviii. p. 164.) The same idea had previously been entertained
by Lawarck, (Philosophie Anatomique, 8yo, tom. i. pp. 145, 342); and by
Van per Hevex, (Nova Acta Physico-medica Acad. Nat. Cur. tom. xi. Part. II.
P- 368). But with these naturalists also the proposed dismemberment was
founded principally on the presumed absence of mammary organs, unsup-
ported by any additional facts relative to the internal anatomy of the species
in question.

This mode of viewing the Monotremata was not, therefore, generally
asxented to. Possessing 80 many peculiarities of structure, these animals
could not fail of attracting due attention from the immortal Cuvier, With
his usual sagacity, he had very early perceived the true nature of the rela-
tion in which the Myrmecophaga aculeata of Syaw stood to the genus it was
then placed in, and accordingly in the © Tableau Elementaire de I'Histoire
Naturelle,” (1797,) he separated it from the true ant-eaters, under the deno-
mination of Echidna. He subsequently made considerable additions to the
anatomical history of this species as well as to that of the Ornithorhynchus,
acknowledged their mutual relations, and adopted the collective term pro-
