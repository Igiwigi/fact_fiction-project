must not rest before one has reduced one to the other or discovered which different
premises (and auxiliary means) have been used in the proofs: When one has two routes
then one must not just go these routes or find new routes, but the whole area lying between
these two routes must be investigated. . .!

Fast forward 118 years: proof theory? is now a well-established mathematical discipline.
However, Hilbert’s original problem, as formulated in his notebook, is still a mystery. We have
no criteria for ‘simplicity’ of a proof. We have no methods to compare proofs, in fact, we do not
even know when two proofs are the same.? In that respect, proof theory is very different from most
other mathematical fields which usually can identify the objects of their interest. For example, in
group theory, two groups are the same if they are isomorphic, and in topology, two spaces are the
same if they are homeomorphic.

This is clearly embarrassing for proof theory as a mathematical field; and only a satisfactory
notion of proof identity can eventually lead to a satisfactory answer to Hilbert’s 24th problem.
Furthermore, the lack of understanding of what actually constitutes a mathematical proof has
consequences for many other areas in which proof theory is applied, in particular, the foundations
of computer science. In fact, the problem of proof identity is no longer some abstract ‘ivory tower
problem’, but it has serious implications for our daily life, as I will argue below.
