Hence to any cubic primal through F,° corre-
sponds a prime of 8. Thus: The linear system of primals giving the reverse trans-
formation is the complete system of «* cubic primals through a certain quintic surface
F,5, defined as the locus of lines which meet five general planes in [4]. The primals are all
Segre cubics, and ¥.5 is the locus of their nodes. (Any one of the Segre cubics has in fact
10 nodes ; and these lie at the intersections of pairs of any set of five associated planes
on it. One such set of five planes lies on V,°, and the corresponding intersections
therefore lie on F,5.)

It only remains now to show the chief relations between the figures in 8 and , and
in doing this several interesting properties of the second figure come to light. We
begin by a brief discussion of c; and the system of quadrics ®.
