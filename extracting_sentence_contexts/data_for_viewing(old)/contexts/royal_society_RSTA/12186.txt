101. The hypothesis of finite though very small compressibility of the ether h
oceasionally been kept in view in the foregoing analysis, in the hope that it may le
to results having some affinity to gravitation. There does not appear however to
any correspondence of this kind. A tentative theory has already been proposed a
examined by W. M. Hicks, which makes preeeis a secondary effect of the

of their vacuous cores. But the periods of such vibrations are not very, iffere
from the periods of their other types; and the theory cannot be said to be successft
the objections to it being in fact fully stated by its author.*
