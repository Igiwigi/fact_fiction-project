The distal end of the rads
gives no indication of having supported two bones ; while on the outer distal
of the scapho-lunar is a distinct facet which seems to correspond in size and ,
with the central bone which is below it. It is, I think, unnecessary to discuss Professor BARDELEBEN’S views furthe
this character of the carpus, because I have obtained new evidence of the sti
of the carpus in allied animals (p. 36; Plate 2, fig. 17), with the bones united by
in other genera, demonstrating three bones in the proximal row. And this seemso

Professor BARDELEBEN, however, proposed to obtain an additional bone
