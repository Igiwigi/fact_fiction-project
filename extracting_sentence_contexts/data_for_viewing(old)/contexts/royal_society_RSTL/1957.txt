to be attributed to the heat developed by it; but should any periodical effects,
corresponding to the time of the sun's rotation about its axis, be observable in the
diurnal variation, we must suppose that the sun, like the earth, is endued with
magnetism, and look for a cause of this magnetism, common to all the planets,
Being engaged more than two. years ago in making some experiments on the effects
produced on the needle by unpolarized iron, I discovered that a peculiar polarity
was imparted to the iron by simply making it reyolve about‚Äù an axis; and this
naturally suggested the question to me, whether the magnetism of the earth, and
consequently, that of the other planets and the sun, might not be owing to their
rotation? From the effects which I have observed to be produced on iron by its
rotation, it appears probable, if the magnetism of these bodies be not caused by
their rotation, that at least the effects will be modified by, and, to a certain extent,
dependent on such rotation. Since first observing the fact, that simple rotation
will cause a peculiar polarity, if I may be allowed the expression, in iron, I have
made a great variety of experiments on the subject, which haye enabled me to trace
the laws according to which this polarity in the iron affects a magnetic needle,
independently of the effect ,produced by the mass. It would lead me to too great
a length here to state the several effects that are produced by the rotation of iron,
or the laws which govern them ; but I will briefly mention one. Let us imagine a
plane to pass through the centre of an horizontal needle, at right angles to the
meridian, and making an angle with the horizon equal to the dip ; then, if the
plane of a circular plate of iron coincide with this plane, and the plate be fixed on

an axis passing through its centre at right angles to its plane, s0 that it can be
made to reyolye in its own plane, the direction of the needle will be different,
