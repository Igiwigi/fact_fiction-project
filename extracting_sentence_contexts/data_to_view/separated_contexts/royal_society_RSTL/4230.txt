The thermo-
meters were then all placed in it and parallel to each other ; they were thus allowed to
remain for one hour, and their readings were taken quickly. Water of a different
temperature was then prepared in a similar way, and $80 on successively. The com-
parisons occupied an entire night, and during this interval of time the temperature
of the room was kept uniform, in fact it did not vary one degree. [

This method was found to be very troublesome, and to ensure accuracy a
long time was required to be devoted to it. The mixing of water of different
temperatures together, so that the whole mixture became of the same temperature,
from the circumstance of its being 80 bad a conductor of heat, was found to be
difficult.
