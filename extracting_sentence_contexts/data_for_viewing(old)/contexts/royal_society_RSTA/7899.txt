It was originally intended to measure the total vapour pressure in solutions of nitro-
cotton directly in the same apparatus that has already been described, but a few
experiments showed that the experimental error was too large. This was a consequence
of the results depending on a small difference between two large numbers—the total
vapour pressures of pure solvent and of the solution. The method was accordingly
modified to a differential one ; the acetone was syphoned over instead of being distilled,
and this made possible its separation into three samples of the same composition, one
of which was used for density determination, one for making up the nitrocotton solution,
and one, so to speak, to balance against the solution. Now, since the vapour pressure
difference between solvent and solution is being read directly, only the slope of the
reference graphs enter into the calculation. The slope is much more accurately defined
by the points than the actual position of the curves. The fact that there are now only
two readings to take instead of four will also reduce errors. This method will now be
described in detail.
