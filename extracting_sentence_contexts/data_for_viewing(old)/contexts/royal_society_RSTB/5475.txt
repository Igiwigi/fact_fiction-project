PETER (1895) showed that this nerve occurs in Bufo and in the Gymnophiona, but is
lost in Rana* amongst anuran types. ALBREcHT thought he had found remnants of
the pro-atlas in the form of a free dorsal piece on the top of the atlas of crocodiles, of
Hatteria, and even of Erinaceus, and called this piece the ‘‘ eparcuale pro-atlantis.” He
was supported by Horrmann, WiepERSHEIM, Dotto, Baur and Howes, but failed
to receive support from Gapow and Corner. Gapow believed this piece to be the
neural spine of the atlas. Making use of the work of Frortsp, he criticised ALBRECHT’S
attempt to homologise the amphibian pro-atlas, stating that “in the Amniota at least _
* two neuromeres and scleronieres have been added to the cranium, the first two post-
cranial nerves of the Amphibia being converted into the hypoglossus of the Amniota.
Consequently neither the ‘atlas’ nor the second vertebra of Amphibia is strictly
homologous with the atlas of the Amniota.” He referred to these vertebre as “ pro-
atlantic vertebre.” In Mus the evidence points to the fact that at least 5 segments
contribute to the formation of the occipital region of the cranium, so that, accepting
Gapow’s nomenclature, at least five of the most anterior vertebre of Amphibia are
“pro-atlantic vertebra.” The formation of the hypoglossal nerve is intimately connected
with the development of the cervical flexure, and although little that is not extremely
speculative can be advanced regarding the inclusion of the pro-atlantic vertebra into
the occipital region of the cranium, yet it seems that in mammals generally, an ex-
planation of the phylogenetical significance of this flexure would provide the key to
an elucidation of the problem.

But the question of the so-called pro-atlas is quite distinct from that of the pro-
atlantic vertebra. The predominant view is expressed by Hayek (1923) when he
says that in many mammalian types, “ bildet sich aus dem Kérper des Proatlas die
