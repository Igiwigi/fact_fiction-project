existence in many Invertebrata of at least one detached spherical body on the surface of the fecundated yelk,
before segmentation, seems to point to the conclusion that these bodies haye some important signification with
reference to the future embryo. QuaTzerAGes, who has recently directed attention to the fact of their
occurrence, properly remarks, that their presence at this stage of development of the egg is much more general
than it has hitherto been supposed. These bodies have been seen equally in the Vertebrata as in the Invertebrata. In the Vertebrata they appear
to have been first noticed, but entirely misunderstood, by Dr. MarTix Barsy in the Rabbit.
