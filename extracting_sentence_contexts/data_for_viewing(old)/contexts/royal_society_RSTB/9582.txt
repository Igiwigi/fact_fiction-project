1. Introduction

The convention on biological diversity (CBD) calls for the protection of 17% of
terrestrial area and 10% of the world’s oceans, through effectively and equitably
managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected
areas (PAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures, by 2020
(Aichi Target 11 [1]). Although PA coverage is approaching these percentage tar-
gets in many parts of the terrestrial and marine realms [2,3], global biodiversity is
still declining [4]. The fact that declines are also seen within many PAs [5,6]
emphasizes the need to enhance the effectiveness of existing PAs for conserving

Electronic supplementary material is available biodiversity [7], in addition to increasing the area under protection [8,9].
