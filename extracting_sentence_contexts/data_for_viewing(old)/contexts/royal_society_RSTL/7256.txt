SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS. 855

The atomic theory may be compared to a sort of © abacus” or sImple mechanical instru-
ment which chemists have invented to facilitate their calculations. Tt is useless to Pre-
tend that any demonstration can be given of this theory, which, at best, can only be re-
garded as a possible hypothesis suggested by the facts; but nevertheless it has a very real
claim upon our consideration from the practical advantages which it has afforded in the
8tudy of the science. The atoms of the chemist fulfil a similar purpose in his calculations
to that fulfilled by balls in the estimation of probabilities. They afford a sImple and not
inaccurate image of the subject with which he is concerned, by which he is enabled to
reduce his problems to a concrete form, and thus at once to realize and to isolate them.
To forbid the use of such an image would be to impose a very Uunnecessary restriction
upon scientific methods. A. ball as the concrete s8ymbol of an indivisible whole, may
advantageously represent, as occasion requires, a unit of weight, a sImple weight, an
event. We are perfectly free, when it its our purpose, to make use of s8wch concep-
tions. Tt is, however, a fatal illusion to mistake the snggestions of fancy for the realities
of nature, and such a symbol becomes open to serious objection unless we carefully dis-
criminate between conjecture and fact. Under the baneful influence of such hypotheses
