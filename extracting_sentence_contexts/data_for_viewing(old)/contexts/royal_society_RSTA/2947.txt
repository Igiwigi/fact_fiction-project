and the corresponding solutions are often referred to as ‘generalized’ travelling breathers or
solitary waves, or ‘nanopterons’ (thereafter we shall use the denomination ‘travelling breather’
independently of the presence or the absence of a non-decaying oscillatory tail). The tails are close
to a linear phonon (or a superposition thereof) whose wavenumber q and frequency o satisfy a
resonance condition reminiscent of (3.5) [13,63]. Typically, the tail amplitude can vary freely in
some interval, with a lower bound exponentially small compared with the main pulse at small
amplitude, a limit in which the wave becomes loosely localized (e.g. [13] and references therein).
In generic models, the tail may exactly vanish only under special choices of the speed of the
travelling breather (or the system parameters) [64,65]. In connection with the above phenomena,
travelling breathers excited from localized initial perturbations are often followed by a small
oscillatory tail, see e.g. [34,37] in the context of granular crystals.

Part of the above phenomenology can be transposed to the present setting despite the fact
that equation (1.4) is fully nonlinear. Indeed, instead of weakly modulated phonons, the tails can
involve nonlinear periodic travelling waves of (1.4) taking the form [32]

where 92(k) =4 sin? (k/2). These solutions are parametrized by the wavenumber k, amplitude p >
0 and phase ¢ (expression (3.29) can be obtained by setting A=1 and R= pV@ in (2.10)). These
periodic waves (or slow modulations thereof) are good candidates to approximate oscillatory tails
of exact travelling breathers when n — +00, or to describe the small oscillations emitted at the rear
of (non-stationary) moving breathers generated from localized perturbations.

In order for a ‘resonant’ travelling wave to match (3.1), the wavenumber k and amplitude p
