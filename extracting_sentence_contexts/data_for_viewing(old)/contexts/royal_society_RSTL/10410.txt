differing in no visible respect from those which had developed along the more usual
course. The matter appeared to me of 8uch interest and importance that T gladly
availed myself of the aid of two of my fellow workers ab the laboratory—Mr. H. L,
Os8BoRN and Dr. J. Merepita WirsoN—in order to 8tudy as completely as possible
the various forms of development. A. large number of eggs, produced at different
times by different individuals, were kept under continuous observation from the time
of fertilisation up to an advanced stage of the segmentatiou ; they were then proved
to be capable of full and normal development by isolation in small glass vessels until
the free-swimming larval stage was attained. We were thus enabled to determine
with all possible certainty the fact that at least five or six well-marked modes of yolk-
cleavage, with many minor yariations, may occur as normal phenomena of development,
that the segmentation may be at firsb equal or unequal, complete or partial, regular or
irregular, and that a great amount of variation exists in the duration of .the various
stages of activity and quiescence.

The interval between fertilisation and the first cleavage varies greatly, and is in
general greater when the temperature is low. Segmentation may begin within ninety
minutes after fertilisation, or ib may be delayed three or four hours beyond this, It
was found that the longer this preliminary quiescence continued, the more apt the
eggs were to pass through the less usual modes of development, while those which
developed promptly were as a rule of the two common types about to be described.
