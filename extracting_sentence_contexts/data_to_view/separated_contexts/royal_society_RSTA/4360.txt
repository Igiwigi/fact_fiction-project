The variance of the transmitted symbol x; is o2 =P for alli. The capacities of these two discrete-time channels are shown in figure 4a, where the shaded
region indicates that the capacity of the non-coherent channel is known by means of upper
and lower bounds (see appendix) but not exactly. Despite the fact that they both communicate
over the same waveform channel, their capacities are quite different. Interestingly, the capacity
of the complex discrete-time AWGN channel is log,(1 + 02/02) bit/symbol, which corresponds
to (1/Ts) log,(1 + 02/02) bit/s. This is exactly the same expression as (4.2), which shows that
this combination of transmitter and receiver is, indeed, optimal for the continuous-time AWGN
channel.
