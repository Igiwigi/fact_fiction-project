The median of the three nerves probably also represents
the frontal nerve (figures 15 and 16). The large nerve—the corono-lateral—leaving the sub-oesophagal ganglion laterally,
which has previously been described as the nerve to the adductor muscle, supplies the
upper musculature of the mantle and its main stem ends in Darwin’s muscle. It is connected
to the adductor muscle by a minute strand of one or two fibres only and it is suggested that
this muscle is, in fact, an independent effector organ (figure 17). REFERENCES
