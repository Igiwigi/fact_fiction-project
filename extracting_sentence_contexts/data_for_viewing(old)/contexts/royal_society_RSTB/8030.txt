of the second ‘generation’ which were formed by ovulation, ceased to develop, and began
to regress, when they reached the stage of growth represented by stage b of the diagram in
figure 8. In the fresh specimen these three corpora lutea, as well as the newer one, C,
were at first thought to be of very recent formation because the traumata of ovulation were
not completely healed, and traces of extruded blood were still to be seen even in the case
of the oldest, A. The suggestion is that these corpora lutea are relatively short-lived, the
successive ‘generations’ (A—B-C) being produced at a series of oestrous cycles. There is, of
course, no evidence as to whether these cycles are like the so-called ‘silent heat’ of the ewe,
i.e. growth, rupture and luteinization of follicles without the symptoms of heat, or whether
they are accompanied by oestrus, with or without infertile mating.

There remains the problem of the status of the most recently formed corpus luteum of
£130, that which has been called C. It is possible that this was in fact the corpus luteum
of conception (see p. 132) and that the animal was actually pregnant. If this was the case,

the embryo must have been minute, and lying free in the uterine lumen. The Fallopian
tubes were carefully dissected out within an hour of death, and thoroughly transfused with
fluid which, after the addition of a preservative, was subsequently searched for the presence
of an ovum, without success. The uterine lining was smooth and creamy in texture, and
the uterus was carefully removed and searched as thoroughly as possible. It was thought
at the time that a structure of as much as, say, 3mm diameter would have been located. ‘The
histological condition of this corpus luteum is illustrated in figures 23) and 244, plate 7,
