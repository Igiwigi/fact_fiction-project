Thus we have six sporangiophores and twelve foliar divisions of
the barren verticils. Whatever these facts indicate they are in harmony with the
prevalence of the trimerous type of structure 80 characteristic of the stem of Astero-
phyllites. After balancing these various facts and arguments, I am led to the conclusion that
Calamostachys Binneyana has much closer affinities with Asterophyllites than with
Calamites. With the latter it has no one structural feature in common.
