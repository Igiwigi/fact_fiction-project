recrystallization it is impossible to prove whether each lamella was laid down as
a single crystal, or as an aggregate of very short fibres, each with its long axis at
right angles to the plane of the lamella ; but appearances under crossed nicols suggest
the latter condition.

Such septa, which consist of contiguous rhabdacanths bound into a plate by
lamellar sclerenchyme, are here called rhabdacanthine septa.

Variability—The relations of the lamellae and the rhabdacanths are variable.
Usually the septal series is swathed as a whole by the lamellae, but occasionally a
rhabdacanth is separately enclosed. A septum may sometimes contain two series
of rhabdacanths, either alternating, or placed side by side. This shows that com-
pound septa are possible in Rugosa, and explains many puzzling facts in other genera.

Morphology and Histology—The nature of the “ rods ” : The occurrence of “ rods ”
in individuals of this species is constant enough to be a diagnostic character. Else-

genus T7yplasma, and in Cantrillia, and they are characteristic of such species whatever
the horizon or locality. These facts, with the constancy of their shape and size and
positional relation to the spines, show that they are either appearances dependent
on the original structure of the spine, or original parts of it. It is conceivable that
