that partners interact almost exclusively with each other but
not with other members of the clade. For example, many
tree species of the genus Ficus and wasps of the family Agao-
nidae have co-diversified to form pairs of species with highly
specific host-pollinator interactions [91-95]. Further analysis
by Segar et al. found that entire fig wasp communities in
Africa, Australia and America form five ecological guilds
that have independently evolved towards similar relative
abundances [96].
