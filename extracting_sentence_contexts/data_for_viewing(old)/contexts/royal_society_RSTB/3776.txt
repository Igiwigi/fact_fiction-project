in preponderance or there may be approximate equality, but there is never an
excess of polytes $s. Exception, brood 12.

iv. The factors for the production of romulus 9s may be introduced into a strain
pure to the polytes (or polytes and cyrus) form by pairing a male of this strain

~ with a romulus 2. Instance, 47, 63.

y. Romulus $s may also be produced by pairing a polytes ¢ with a male from a
romulus throwing strain, so that, whatever the difference between these ?s
may be, it is also represented in the male sex. Instances, broods 13, 65.

These facts immediately suggest a simple explanation; if the difference between
the romulus and polytes forms is represented by an additional pair of factors R and r,
R being such that it converts a mimetic 2 to the romulus form, then the above
generalisations would be realised. The fresh factor R can have no external effect in
the case of the ¢, owing to the presence of the inhibitor P, while in the cyrus ? the
