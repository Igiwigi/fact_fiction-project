or appreciably higher than 11 per cent.; and the composition is in consequence
described sometimes as “anomalous.” But it is clear that this point of view is
conventional. The essential fact is that no nickel-iron alloy, meteoric or terrestrial, is known
which gives Widmanstiitten figures when the percentage of nickel, in the portion of
the material showing the figures, is less than about 6 or more than about 15. Neither of these limits has been fixed precisely, because the structure of an alloy
which gives the figures is heterogeneous and the amount of the meteorite used for the
analysis is generally small (cf. Couen, I., p. 86).
