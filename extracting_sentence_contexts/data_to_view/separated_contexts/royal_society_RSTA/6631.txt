According to (i), a = ®.(q,,...,@,), say. This implies that the
Spbvious inequality R,.(R:a) S (R,:a) reduces, in the present case, to equality. (Namely,
if bac§,, there exist elements u; of R not in p, such that u;ba;e R, whence u, ...u,bac KR.)

ZUsing these relations, it follows from (8.1) that

a.(R:a) = Na(R:a) RK, = Na(R,:a) =NR, = KR.

$ The following simple result belonging to the same order of ideas is also used in Part I:

% (8.8) Suppose ® has only one maximal ideal P. Ifa subset YW of the quotient field of R
generates a principal ideal, (Ql) = 6, then a generating element for (WY) can be selected

Strom A.
2 In fact, At bP provided b+ 0; and any element of bR not in df is an associate of b.

4 Some results in the theory of commutative algebras, which find numerous applications in
2 art I, are given here. In this section, A denotes a commutative algebra over a field f, of
P&nite rank m> 0.
