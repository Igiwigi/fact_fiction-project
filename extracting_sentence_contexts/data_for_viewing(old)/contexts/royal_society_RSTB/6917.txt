are, average 10-35 g., extremes 5-85 and 16-00g. The weight of the testes thus delimits
the inactive class fairly well. The other classes, though the average weights show a
progressive increase, are not so sharply marked, owing to the very wide range of

variation within each of them. In fact, it may be said that after reaching puberty the
weight of the testes bears little relation to their state of activity.

Considering now the testis weight when compared with that of the other organs of
the genitalia, we find that a diagram similar to that of fig. 17 is shown in fig. 18, where
the testis weight is plotted against the weight of the penis. The ratio thus demonstrated
shows that the weight of the penis is fairly closely correlated with the general increase in
body size as the animal grows up. The slightly steeper location of the points near the
origin may indicate a more rapid growth on reaching puberty.
