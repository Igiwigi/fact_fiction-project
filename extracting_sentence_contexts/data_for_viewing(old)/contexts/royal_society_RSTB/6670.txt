resolved into a given group of parts without pausing to consider whether such parts
have any actual independent existence “in nature’’. Thus houseflies are known to
breed in manure, and it has been demonstrated that they are attracted to this manure
by an odour of ammonia. It has even been shown that the flies will oviposit on cotton
wool soaked in ammonium carbonate, and Loeb (1918) has asserted that the fly’s
oviposition response is a simple mechanical chemotropism. It is, however, very difficult
to assess the significance of such data. It cannot mean that the fly simply responds to
ammonium carbonate as such, because what actually exists in nature is ammonium
carbonate emanating from nitrogenous animal or vegetable matter and the relation
of the other constituents of manure other than the carbonate with this compound is
essential for the continued existence of the fly larvae. To say that the medium appears
to the fly to be mainly the carbonate does not alter the fact that throughout its evolution
the fly has required a certain minimum amount of organic material for its existence
and presumably the race as a whole has never responded to anything else. Crystals
of the carbonate and an equivalent mass of nitrogenous matter have in common the
same odour, but in no other sense are qualities given in bare perception the same. That
these other sense qualities are of importance to the fly has been shown by later workers,
and the carbonate soaked in pine sawdust was found to give better responses than
cotton, while chaff or acidulated horse manure was superior to the sawdust.

Such considerations are of even greater importance in the host-parasite relationship.
Thus suppose an organic compound A was isolated from the gipsy moth egg and
Ooencyrius females were attracted to the compound by its smell. As A is a material
body it will be characterized by other qualities which will be.given in perception and,
