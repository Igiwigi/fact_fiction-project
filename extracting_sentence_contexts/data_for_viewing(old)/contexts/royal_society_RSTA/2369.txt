12000cm~') for states not yet observed [38]. This was extended to the energy region of up to
15300cm™! [39] after replacing the simple linear b; scaling with a quadratic scaling, for which
numerical values of the scaling parameters were obtained with the help of the new experimental
data [40,41]. The predictions made in the above-mentioned papers were useful to guiding the
measurements performed by Wolf and co-workers [42] at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg.
Extremely weak vibrational overtone lines were measured using an action spectroscopy method.
The strongest lines were identified with the help of the line list provided by Neale et al. [43].
The line positions from that work provided an upper bound for the frequency scan, while
those from [38] provided a lower bound [44]. New computations performed with the use of
the GLH3P potential energy surface and the Moss vibrational masses gave close agreement
with the experimental frequencies [44]. The smallness of the rotational parameters, a, and 42,
demonstrated that the rotational non-adiabatic correction is one order of magnitude smaller than
the vibrational correction. Furthermore, due to the fact that the rotational transitions obey the
angular momentum selection rule AJ =0,+1, and hence the absolute J-dependent errors are
similar for the two states, these errors almost cancel out when energy differences are formed.
Therefore, the computed rotational transition frequencies are more accurate than the term values
themselves (10-°-10~? cm! for moderate values of J).

(b) Vibrational and rotational shifts by effective mass models

In a paper published in 2007, Kutzelnigg [19] addressed the question of ‘Which masses are
vibrating or rotating in a molecule?’ and analysed the cases of Hz and Hj. Explicit formulae
for effective masses for these molecules were derived starting from an LCAO (linear combination
of atomic orbitals) approach. This inspired Mohallem and co-workers [45] to formulate a theory
of separation of motions of core and valence electrons. In their approach, the electronic density is
