also be greater in those of A than in those of B, when both are crossed with a
female Z. Precisely the same may be said of the female, as is seen in the same
series, and perhaps still better in Nos. 221-227; in Nos, 121-124 as the (vi. wt.)
female transmits the cross-bars more fully than the (brn. wt.), when crossed with
male (a), viz., 39: 80 per cent., so it does when crossed with (b), viz., 22:19 per cent.

8. On the Conditions Favourable to Cross-fertilisation.

An examination of the notes attached to the tables of experiments shows that the
proportion of eggs fertilised varies to an immense extent, and that these variations
seem to be influenced in many cases by the external conditions. A considerable
number of papers have been written on the causes of such variations, but their con-
clusions differ greatly from one another, and this is not surprising, since the facts
seem frequently to be contradictory among themselves. VERNON, for example, in his
earlier papers (5), concludes that eggs which have been kept are more easily fertilised
by foreign sperm than fresh eggs, but in his last paper (9) he shows that this is not
always the case. Similarly, the effects of temperature and other external conditions
seem to vary in different cases, so that conditions which in one instance seem to favour
cross-fertilisation, at another, appear to be adverse to it. I will here discuss the
various conditions to which the sexual cells were subjected from the point of view of
their effect on the percentage of eggs fertilised and of larvee produced.

As has been said, the effect of keeping the eggs varies very largely in different
cases. In the experiments made in 1901, in nearly all cases the number of blastulze
was markedly greater from eggs which had been kept for about 8 hours than from
