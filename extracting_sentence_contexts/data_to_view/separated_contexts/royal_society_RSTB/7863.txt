Of the two doubtful cases one, E115, was a young
animal and was possibly pregnant for the first time, but the other, E31, was large, and
certainly parous, and had possibly completed a lactation before becoming pregnant again. On the other hand, lactation may have been terminated by the loss of the calf; the condi-
tion of the mammary glands was doubtful because it was not possible to examine them
until a considerable time after death, and decomposition was advanced. REPRODUCTION OF THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT 107

The fact that no milk was expressible from the mammary glands of several pregnant
animals, including one near term, which from their size would appear to be pregnant for
the first time, suggests that the presence of milk, easily expressed from the nipples, indicates
the occurrence of lactation. The observation that milk cannot be expressed from the nipples
of the pregnant animal which is not feeding a calf agrees with statements by Ferrier (1948),
for the Asian, and Offermann (1949 unpublished), for the African elephant, to the effect
that milk cannot be squeezed from the nipples of a pregnant elephant with no calf until
very shortly before parturition. Thus in nineteen of the pregnant animals—indeed, in all to
which the test could be applied except the three first pregnancies and two doubtful cases
—pregnancy was apparently accompanied by lactation.
