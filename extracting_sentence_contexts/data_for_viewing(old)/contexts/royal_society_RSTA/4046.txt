material. Importantly, smaller M@C2,,(2n < 76) metallofullerenes, although abundantly generated
by vaporization of graphite, are entirely absent in the figure. They also reported similar bottom-
up formation of medium-sized fullerenes to larger metallofullerenes with other metal atoms
encapsulated in M@Cg» such as Y@Cg2 and Yb@Cg2.
The bottom-up metallofullerene formation mechanism that Dunk et al. proposed [25-27
seems to well explain many experimental observations, including the long-standing issue o:
‘isotope scrambling experiments’ previously described [28,29]. Those studies establish that


amorphous 18C is statistically incorporated into fullerene cages when combined with graphite
and subsequently evaporated by means of the arc discharge or laser ablation synthesis method.
This strongly indicates that graphite is initially transformed into small carbon species such
as C and C, which then react to ultimately generate metallofullerenes. In fact, that process
has so far been demonstrated repeatedly during the past couple of decades considering the
large number of reports which use formation of !%C-enriched metallofullerenes for %*C NMR
spectroscopic study [16]. The bottom-up growth mechanism seems much likely because of the
direct experimental observation of C)-incorporation (digestion) into fullerenes /metallofullerenes
to form larger fullerenes. Further studies are needed, however, as to whether or not the bottom-up
growth is equally valid in arc-discharge and combustion synthetic conditions as in laser-ablation
described here.
