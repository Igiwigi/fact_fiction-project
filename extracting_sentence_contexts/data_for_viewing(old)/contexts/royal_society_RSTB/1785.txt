of the factors which would enable us to establish at least monogenous probabilities for
the mothers. But what use can we make of that one factor if the other, that is, the
number of married wives (classed according to their age) is wanting? Or, if these
statistics exist, but, if the wives are grouped according to different limits of age, how
is it possible to compare them? Or, if the division of ages is identical, but the two
data refer to different periods of time ?

And besides, after all such really existing difficulties, if we finally succeed in —
calculating some natalities, we obtain but half-a-dozen natal probabilities, so that in —
face of the hundreds and thousands of probabilities contained in a complete table,
those poor results cannot claim to be placed on the same level, to be regarded in
general as tables of natality. The indifference with which this important question has
been treated is proved best by the fact, that even in those few cases where it would
be possible to calculate some monogenous probabilities, this calculation has often been
quite omitted. As will be seen in the following pages, hitherto not a single specified
bigenous, and not even a single specified male table of natality has been produced.
What we possess is only one specified table for the female (Berlin), whilst a second

* Not so with the life-tables. Since, in the countries where registers of population exist, each case of
death is noted in the column (or the card) of the enumerated person, it is possible to ascertain the pro-
bability of death by observation of the individuals. (See the Author’s paper on Life Tables addressed
to the International Statistical Congress of Budapest, 1876, published separately, Berlin, 1879 and the
individual method there recommended.)
