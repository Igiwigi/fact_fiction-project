In turn, repeated selfing (e.g. [63,64]). Indeed, ddm1 deficiencies or
these observations suggest that severe and widespread loss null nrpd1 alleles have not been observed in nature. Thus,
of methylation at TE sequences is strongly counter-selected we must conclude that natural stable epialleles are most
in nature, a conclusion further supported by the fact that the likely generated either spontaneously or in response to the

derived alleles of CMT2 and NRPE1 associated with reduced environment.

Figure 3. Rate of occurrence per genome for point mutations, TE insertions, point epimutations at CGs, and region-level epimutations at CGs, CHGs and CHHs (data
obtained from Denkena et a/. [69] and Baduel et al. [54] for TE insertion substitution rates). Genomic rates were obtained from measures per site per generation
multiplied by the target size per genome.
