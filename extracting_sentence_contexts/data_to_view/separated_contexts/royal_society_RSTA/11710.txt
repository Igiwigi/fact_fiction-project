As for the selenite and
selenate an experiment to be described indicates that they will be decomposed,
yielding free selenium, with which some of the lime will form calcium selenide. We find, however, calcium selenide is decomposed when suspended in water by
carbonic acid gas yielding free selenium, but not a trace of selenium hydride. These
facts were established as follows :â€”

About 4 grams of precipitated chalk were converted into calcium selenate, and this
was reduced by hydrogen (pure) to calcium selenide. During the operation much of
the selenide decomposed into free selenium and lime (?), and there was a considerable
evolution of selenium hydride. The process was stopped while the evolution was in
full progress.
