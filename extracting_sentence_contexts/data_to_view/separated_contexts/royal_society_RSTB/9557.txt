Downs [2] first posited a pure rational
choice equation for the vote decision, where a person votes if the benefits
from one’s preferred candidate winning, weighted by the probability that
the individual is making the decisive vote, is greater than the cost of voting. However, an obvious paradox exists in this model—and in models of civic
engagement more broadly—in that if it were true, no one would ever vote:
the probability of being the decisive voter is so low that the benefit becomes
infinitesimally small and any cost is enough to override the calculated benefits. Yet, despite this theoretical expectation, we observe that millions of individuals are
in fact civically engaged. This contrast between our theoretical expectations and
the empirical reality has generated decades of scholarship seeking to disentangle
the sources of inter-individual variation in participation. Author for correspondence:
