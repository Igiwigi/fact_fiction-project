However, looking at
thermal desorption spectroscopy, the degassing tends to happen at a
much higher temperature. But having a higher surface is very special
because all the size effects come in in a different way; that is one of
the caveats to worry about. Nevertheless, the fact that the hydrogen-
containing pillar is behaving differently to the virgin pillar at these
temperatures is still interesting. Afrooz Barnoush Is there something special about zirconium? Ben Britton Very much so.
