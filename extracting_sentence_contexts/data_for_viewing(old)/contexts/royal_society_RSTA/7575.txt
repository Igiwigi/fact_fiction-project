attitude it is possible to calculate the size which a nucleus must reach before it will be stable
and continue to grow in a solution of known supersaturation. A nucleus smaller than the
critical size would have a high solution pressure and would be more likely to dissolve than
to grow. This seems to be in qualitative accord with the demonstration by Hulett (1901)
that very small crystals of gypsum show enhanced apparent solubility in water and also
with the fact that slightly supersaturated solutions do not nucleate spontaneously. Calcula-
tions based on such considerations suggest that the barrier to nucleation would be so very
high as to cast doubt on the correctness of the assumptions. For instance, it has been shown
in this Department, by developing a treatment of the problem by Jones (1913), that in
potassium sulphate solution at a concentration 1-4 times the saturation value, the minimum
radius of a stable spherical crystal would be about 3-6 10-8 cm. In this calculation the
free energy absorbed per unit increase in surface area was taken as 200 ergs/sq.cm., but
taking any other of the wide range of free energy values which have been quoted, the
calculated radius of the smallest viable crystal would still be so big that the nucleus would
contain many thousands of ions. The sudden formation of a properly arranged nucleus
containing thousands of ions by normal kinetic processes must be regarded as extremely
improbable. Yet nuclei do form, often very readily. It seems necessary to regard the
properties of a nucleus as in some way different from those of a massive crystal, either in
