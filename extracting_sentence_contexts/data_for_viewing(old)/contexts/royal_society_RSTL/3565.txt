258 MR, SAVORY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF MUSCULAR FIBRE.

Now with regard to the comparative dimensions of many of these fibres, it must be
observed that the size of the foetus did not always correspond to the degree of its
development, and this for two reasons. First, growth and development do not
always proceed at an equal or uniform rate. Secondly and chiefly, it was impossible
to obtain a sufficient supply of foetal pigs from parents of the same size. I had no
means of choosing in this respect, and received specimens both from small and large
sows. Moreover, I could not generally ascertain the exact age of the foetus examined,
and have, therefore, to avoid error, only spoken of its length.

These facts will explain the results of some measurements, which might otherwise
appear to be contradictory.
