> $Q sinh 2a (w—«) {P cosh 2a (w—a)}™.

Now P, Q cannot increase or decrease indefinitely, and therefore, if we do not
allow a to tend to zero, we have that |v| and |Dv + /\| bear to exp a («—a) ratios

which are limited in both directions ; and this is true, both when the sub-intervals are
increased in number and also when || is increased indefinitely.

In the same way it may be seen that the ratios of |w/A| and |Du| to exp«(«—a)
are limited in both directions.

When « = 0 the argument shows that |\/r{, |Du|, |v], and |Do + V/r| are
limited above, but not below, and, in fact, we know that each of the four is capable
of vanishing.

10. The condition that log 7 should be of uniformly limited total fluctuation is
necessary, for if it is not fulfilled P may be indefinitely great or small, and it is
conceivable that w/\ and Du, for instance, should become very small together, in
the same way that a pendulum would be practically stopped if its velocity were
suddenly reduced in a constant ratio at every passage through the lowest position
and increased in the same ratio at every time of reaching one of the extreme
positions, when, of course, the increase would be of no effect.

11. Hence if in (5) we take the limits to be a, b and put p’ = 7, a local average
of p, o =0, N=, ¢=¢(x, a), ¢' =u(a,b), we have
