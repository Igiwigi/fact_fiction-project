The experiments which I formerly made with two pendulums similar to the
present, in a chamber artificially heated to between 80* and 909, gave for the
correction for each degree of Faukexnrr, respectively for the two pendulums,
0.432 and 0.430, corresponding to that part of the thermometer scale which is
included between 45* and 85*. Those results accord well with each other, and
are somewhat different from that which is now obtained, and which correspond
to the part of the scale comprised between 30* and 60*. But in the experiments
in the chamber artificially heated, the fluctuations of temperature, in spite of
every precaution, were considerable, and rendered the determination of: the
mean temperature more difficult, and probably less exact than in the natural
temperatures : hence it would be unsafe to conclude in favour of the inference
to which these facts would otherwise lead, that the correction at high tempera-
tures is less than at low temperatures, or that, the metal expands a smaller pro-
portion of its length for one degree between 85* and 45*, than for one degree
between 60* and 30?. The experiments at Greenwich were made in those extremes of natural tem-
perature afforded by the climate, in which a tolerably uniform temperature is
maintained for seyeral days; a condition requisite in such delicate determina-
tions. The clock by Granam was going well on both occasions, and its rate
was assigned by Mr.
