The scala vestibuli is largest ab its vestibular end ; here it is nearly square, being
& inch or 1:05 millim. high, by 4; inch or 1 millim. broad. Further forwards it
becomes smaller and alters its form until it becomes oval, with its greatest diameter
oF inch or 1:15 millim. from side to side, and {5 inch or *58 millim. from top to
bottom. Near the apex of the cochlea the scala vestibuli communicates with the
scala tympani by means of an oval opening—helicotrema—formed by the absence of
the bony lamina, which does not extend as far forward as the apex of the cochlea
(see Plate 45, fig. 1).

The scala tympani is throughout much smaller than the scala vestibuli, and this is
due to the fact that the osseous lamina encroaches much further inwards on its lower
than on its upper 8ide. The scala tympani is nearly circular in section, and varies
very slightly in diameter, {5 inch or 56 millim. throughout its entire length. At
its anterior extremity it unites with the scala vestibuli, as already stated.

These two scalz are lined with endothelium and contain epilymph. In one of my
specimens the scala tympani is almost completely filled, especially its posterior
portion, with a substance resembling organising lymph, the true nature of which
I am at present unable to explain.

Before passing on to the description of the scala media it will be more convenient
to describe the lamina ossea, or outer* portion of the horizontal lamina which divides
the general tube. This corresponds both in position and structure to the lamina
