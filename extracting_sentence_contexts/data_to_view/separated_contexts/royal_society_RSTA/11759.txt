A proper change in the forms of the arbitrary constants would reduce this case to the ordinary one. If the integral factor is @" g'"..., 0,... being functions of ¢, cy... then if in the system of
arbitrary constants we take 6”.¢" . . . instead of c,, the factor will disappear. Tn fact the ordinary equation

y= pr— p’,
or any other, may be transformed so that its singular solution appears as an integral factor. Put

y=t@—2)
and we find
y— pet p= 42 (22-1).
