* The auxiliary parameters A and y introduced in equations (270-3) and (270-6) respectively are of
course different from the parameters A and y of Part II. In fact, A here is the reciprocal of the A used in
Part II.

of these values of 4, there is a real positive value of w, from which is obtained the corre-
sponding value (real and positive) of a, by (270-5). Substituting these values of a, and w,,
(five pairs altogether obtained from five values of 5, for five different zones) in the cost
equation (269-2), a value of T is thereby obtained. Starting from any value of A and pro-
ceeding along a particular chain a certain value for the total cost T is reached.
