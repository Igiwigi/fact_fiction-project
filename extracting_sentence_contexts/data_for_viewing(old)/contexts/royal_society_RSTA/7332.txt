of 30 min. used, These experiments showed that the ionic efficiency of «-radiation was very
low; indeed, in some cases the whole effect observed could be ascribed to the /-rays alone.
Therefore, a reduction in the dose contributed by the f-particles was essential and it was
decided to use thorium X instead of radon, since thorium X can be obtained in solution
practically free from its decay products if a somewhat lengthy series of chemical
manipulations are undertaken.

Unfortunately, however, the thorium X preparation affected the enzyme chemically as
well as through its radiations and the method was abandoned after a few experiments.
These, however, were of value as showing that inactivation of enzyme was, in fact, brought
about by a-radiation, though with low ionic efficiency. The experiments are described in
the appendix.

Reverting to radon as the parent a-ray source, an attempt was made to remove the glass
splinters (the active deposit on which contributes a considerable portion of the f-ray dose)
from the main solution by using a bottle with a long ‘tail’ (figure 1a) into which the
