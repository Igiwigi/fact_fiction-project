interest to different individual birds, and that they lingered
for some time at certain locations. Is being out of the loft
and being released from a site a few km away perceived by
the birds as being an opportunity to further develop
their map and obtain information about the area? If this
is the case, flights that are highly convoluted and extrem-
ely inefficient (e.g. bird 2, figures 4 and 5) could be
interpreted as the individual being exploratory, rather than
being ‘lost’, and potentially unrelated to their laboratory-
based neophobia and SEF behaviour from the loft. If this
was the case, those individuals are exhibiting latent learning
and building up a detailed mosaic map for future use.
The fact that they made it home eventually demonstrates
the desire and motivation to home, and hence deviations
could indeed be interpreted as exploratory and ‘intentional’,
termed ‘exploration refinement’ by Guilford et al. [54]. How-
ever, the long periods of time that the birds spent perched as
opposed to in active flight would suggest this is an unlikely
explanation.

It is established that individual variation in personality can
have fitness consequences [55], with, for example, personality
dictating overwinter survival in female red squirrels (Tamias-
