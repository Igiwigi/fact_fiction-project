In our work on social learning online [27], we found that visual cues may enable stronger attunement by providing
visual social cues (teacher—face and hands) impacted learn- more information about the interaction partner’s gaze and

interactive (student engaged in a live lecture) or observational in teaching videos improved the quality of the lecture in a
