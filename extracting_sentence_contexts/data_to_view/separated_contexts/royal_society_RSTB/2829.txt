the latter diverge clearly from the Leptosporangiate type, and show that in detail
those definite cell-nets of the Leptosporangiate type are not essential characters of
Fern-leaves at large. * These facts point to the justness of the conclusion that the
Fern-leaf, however different in size, continued apical growth, and even in its segmenta-
tion is essentially comparable to the smaller and simpler leaves of the strobiloid forms. It would appear @ priori reasonable to assume that in the first instance the larger-
leaved were derived from a smaller-leaved ancestry. On the other hand, there is a chain of evidence to show that certain of the
Gymnosperms originated from a larger-leaved Cyeado-filicinean ancestry.t It must
not, therefore, be assumed that all small-leaved forms were so derived, or that all large-
leaved forms were of prior origin, though morphological argument has frequently
proceeded on this assumption.
