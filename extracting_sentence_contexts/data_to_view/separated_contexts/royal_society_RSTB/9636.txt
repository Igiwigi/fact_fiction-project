Introduced through expert evidence are sciences which
require an empirical analysis of the data; ‘a method that relies
on scientific instrumentation to provide quantitative data that
can mathematically represent results’ [42, p. 4]. Examples of
this are drug analysis, toxicology or DNA analysis. These are
distinct for their quantitative approach to evidence and the
fact that the result can often be codified, either as a ratio or as
a number. The perception of the lay public is that these sciences
are largely infallible: there is little room for human error, and
objective results can be furnished by a computer. This is a
position which is increasingly undermined with recent chal-
lenges to the validity of DNA analysis in court [43] or, for
example, the increasing challenges to the identification of new
psychoactive substances.
