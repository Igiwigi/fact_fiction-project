peaks in Yj; correspond to the outermost (and lowest) minima in the strength s;, which presents
k peaks. In short, we see that there are field-dependent groups of spins near the boundaries
exhibiting higher, and more homogeneously distributed, pairwise entanglement, which we may
consider as edges. The rest of the spins in the chain, with lower and more heterogeneous local
concurrence distribution, will be denoted as the bulk of the chain. Moreover, these regions are
very clearly delimited and their size strongly depends on the magnetic field, for fixed N.

Interestingly, as the magnetic field decreases, the difference between the disparity of the bulk
of the chain and the one of the edge decreases until, for B= 1/2 (k/(N + 1) =1/3) their respective
values get inverted, namely the bulk disparity becomes lower than the edge disparity. For very
small values of B, one observes a pronounced disparity peak for the two outermost spins of
the chain, corresponding to their highest value of pairwise concurrence; this phenomenon is a
reflection of the fact that, for small B, the network has a nearest-neighbour chain topology, as a
result of which the edge spins have degree equal to one, and hence their disparity can only be
equal to one.

The average behaviour of the network measures is also sensitive to the critical points. This
is revealed by the curves of the average disparity (Y;) and the average strength (s;), shown in
figure 3c, where the discontinuous jumps present for small N gradually become less visible as we
approach the thermodynamic limit. The average strength changes discontinuously at the critical
point B = 1, while the average disparity, measuring entanglement heterogeneity, is undefined for
B>1, since concurrence is zero for all pairs. This behaviour is consistent with the fact that, in
