are replaced while the animal is young.

(2) In the cynodonts Parathrinaxodon proops, Thrinaxodon liorhinus, and Tribolodon
Jrerensis the post-canine teeth belong to two series. The members are situated
alternately in the jaw and are replaced at different stages. There is evidence
of only one replacement of each tooth.

(3) The replacement of alternate teeth at different stages seems to have been
present in the most primitive of the mammal-like reptiles (the Pelycosaurs)
as is shown by three pieces of jaws of Dimetrodon.

That this “ distichical ” condition is typical of the non-mammal-like reptiles has
already been shown by Bork (1922). Bork called attention to the fact that the
tooth germs of living reptiles are situated alternately on the buccal side and at the

base of the dental lamina, and called the two types “ parietal” and “ terminal ”.
The row of parietal tooth germs he called the “ exostichos ”, the row of terminal
germs the “ endostichos”’. He showed that the teeth of the exostichos always
appeared in an embryo before those of the endostichos, but that they were not
replaced by the latter, the teeth of the two rows being functional at the same time,
