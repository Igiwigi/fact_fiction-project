value, We quit this part of our subject in the hope that chemists will be able to help
us to decipher more than has as yet been done.

Solar coincidences.

We have already stated that in order to determine the wave-lengths of the
absorptions in the different spectra, we have taken photographs of the solar spectrum
on the same plate with that of a few of the principal snbstances. Unfortunately,
when at firss we took up the iodides we had no opportunity of thus obtaining
a direct comparison between the FRAUNHOFER lines and ethyl iodide ; but as a
matter immediately affecting our results this has nothing to do, since all the 8nb-
stances mapped are mapped in reference to ethyl iodide. When our maps were at
the point of completion, and in fact when all the measurements but two or three
had been made, it struck us that we might find some analogy between the soJar spec-
trum of this region and our linear absorptions, since these are presumably due
to hydrogen. At that time we noted several of what appeared to be coincidences
