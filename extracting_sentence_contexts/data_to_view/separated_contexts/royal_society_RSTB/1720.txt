The
external form and even the venation of the leaf, however, would by themselves carry
_ ho decisive weight, though hundreds of fossil species have been referred to the Ferns
on no better grounds. But beyond this, the internal structure of the le: uf is now
well known in Lyginodendron, and to a less degree in Heterangium, and proves to be
in all respects that of a Fern, as is shown most clearly by the concentric structure of

Both in structure and form, then, the leaves of Lyginodendron and Heterangium ave
Fern-leaves, their one point of difference being the occurrence of pitted as distinguished
from scalariform tracheides in their xylem. Now, as regards Lyginodendron, the distinctively Fern-like character is limited to
the foliage; this, however, is not the case with the other genus. Apart from the —
secondary growth, the stem of Heterangium is essentially that of a monostelic Fern
of the Gleichenia type.
