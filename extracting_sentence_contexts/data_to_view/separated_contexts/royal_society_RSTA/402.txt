Even when both limbs of a U-tube manometer are of exactly the same diameter, the
vertical distance between the tips of the two mercury menisci, one exposed to the gas and
the other to a vacuum, is not a true measure of the gas pressure unless the depths of the two
menisci are equal. Failure to measure meniscus depths and correct for any difference between
them—a difference which may amount to several tenths of a millimetre, unless the mano-
meter is made of very wide tubing—may lead to errors of great significance in high-
precision manometry. The theoretical treatment of this problem is made difficult by the fact that the relation
between capillary depression and meniscus depth is sensitive to meniscus shape, and the
theoretical tables are consequently somewhat discordant. In correcting for the meniscus
capillary depression we have found it much more satisfactory to use the admirable experi-
mental results of Cawood & Patterson (1933) ; their results are given to the nearest 0-001 mm.,
although they only claim an accuracy to the nearest 0-005 mm. Since, however, the experi-
mental relation between meniscus depth and capillary depression proves to be a linear one,
the net depression for a difference between two similar meniscus depths will be given with
much greater accuracy than is given by each individual expression.
