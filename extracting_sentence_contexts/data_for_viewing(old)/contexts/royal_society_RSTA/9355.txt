120 G. COOK ON THE YIELD POINT AND INITIAL STAGES OF

elastic line in each case showed no appreciable deviation from the straight and for
reasons of space only the portion near the yield point is shown. After the yield point
was passed the torque diminished, but tended to become approximately constant,
with a value considerably less than that causing the yield, over a range of twist at least
six or seven times the twist at the yield point. It will be seen at once that there is a
strong resemblance between the theoretical and experimental diagrams, but it is desirable
to mention here that this resemblance is not conclusive proof of the correctness of the
process of failure assumed by the author. The angle of twist measured is the total
twist over a definite length, and there is no guarantee that this will be uniformly
distributed. The experimental diagram is, in fact, not inconsistent with a process of
overstrain whereby each successive layer yields at a value of the shear stress rather
less than that in the outer layer at the initial yield point, if the process does not take
place simultaneously at every cross section. This point is of some importance, and will
be alluded to later in the general discussion of the results. There is no uncertainty,
however, about the value of the stress in the overstrained zone which may be inferred
from these diagrams. For a comparatively large twist ratio the torque-twist line is
approximately horizontal. The elastic core is then of small diameter, and contributes
