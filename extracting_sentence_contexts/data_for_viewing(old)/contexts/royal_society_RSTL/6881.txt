By reasoning similar to that nsed with respect to equation (2.), we can show that
8in (s—4,) diminishes in passing from the Equinox to the Solstice, and therefore that
(s—7,) also diminishes; therefore the time of vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at the time
of Low Water occurs earlier and earlier as we approach the Solstice. We thus see
that the times of yanishing at High and Low Water move in opposite directions, and

become most widely separated at the time of the Solstice. This result agrees perfectly
with the facts of observation at Port Leopold recorded in "Table IV. and the accom-
panying fig. TIT. Plate XI.

T shall now endeayour to separate, in the Diurnal Tide, the effects of the Sun and
Moon. In equation (1.), the effect of the Sun, represented by the first member of the
right-hand ide of the equation, when observed at High Water, may be considered to
owe its periodical change almost altogether to the change in cos (8—,), the angle s
increasing day by day as the tide becomes later and later; for the angle os may be
regarded as sensibly constant during the semilunation. On the other hand, the Tamar
portion of the Dimrnal Tide owes its change to the change of j, the moon's declination,
for the angle (m—7,,) is sensibly constant. The Solar Diurnal Tide disappears at the
equinox, because then 5=0; hence we may find the Lunar Diurnal Tide, at that period
of the year, uncomplicated by the coexistence of the Solar Tide.
