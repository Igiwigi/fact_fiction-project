The equations of a generating line (since it meets the directrix line z=0, y=0)
may be taken to be

a=0y, :=þ(y—7)5
the condition in order to the intersection of the generating line with the nodal conic is
at once found to be '

as*+2hs+b+2B(f+9e) +e*=0,
and that for its intersection with the simple conic
ag? +2hs+b+20(m+le) +df=0;

and writing the equations of the generating line in the form

—! 2

the elimination of «, B, 0 from these four equations gives the required equation of the
scroll. Writing for a moment

© =a&*+2ha +,
F =gu +f >,
M=lsz +m -
eB* +2FB  +0=0,
(94*+2Myw+du?)B*—2(0y2+Mwz)B+02*=0;
or, introducing at this place the condition c=0, the first equation gives 3= £5. and

we find

we thence obtain
(04% +2Myw+ du?) +4F(0yz+Mwz)+4F%*=0,
or, what is the same thing,
(0y+2F2)*+2Mw(0y+2F2z)+©du*=0;

whence, observing that we have

the equation of the scroll is
(aa*+2hay +by* +2920 + 2fy2)*

+2(a93*+2hay + by*+ 29zx + 2fy2)(lz+my)w

+ (aa*+2hay+0b)du*=0. And we see from the equation that the surface contains the line (y=0, y=0) as a double
line, the conic

w=z0, aa*+2hay+by*+ 2gzx + 2fyz=0
as a double curve, also the conic

2=0, aa*+2hay+by* + 21aw+2myw+du*=0

-as a simple curve on the surface,—the complete intersection by the plane 2=0 being in
"fact the last-mentioned conic, and the pair of lines

2=0, aa*+2hay+by*=0. Quartic Scroll, Eighth Species, $(1, 3*), with a directris line, and a directriz skew
: eubic met twice by each generating line.

47. We 8ee, & priori, that the scroll is of the order 4, that is, a quartic scroll; in fact
for the scroll $(1, 1?) the order is =[m]+M (firs: memoir, p. 457), and we have here
m=3, M=h—4[mP=1—3=—2; that is, order =6—2, =4.
