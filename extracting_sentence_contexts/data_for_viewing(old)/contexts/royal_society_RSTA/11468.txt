Such a wholesale tendency to a rise of zero, whatever its cause, would have
introduced great uncertainty into any conclusions drawn, even as to the recovery
during the first 14 hours, the shortest interval for which results are given.

§ 54. Part 3 of Mr. Wuymrer’s pamphlet, dealing with the “Determination of
Altitudes,” discusses the best method of utilising the readings of aneroid barometers.
I hardly think that Mr. Waymrrr makes due allowance for the fact that in
mountain ascents the reduction of pressure is very gradual, even at the lower stages.
This allows accommodation to take place, so that on arrival at the summit the
instrument will not behave as it would have done if rapidly transported there.
Again the difference between descending and ascending readings is very different in
aneroids whose readings as pressure falls at a given rate may be equally correct, and
the difference increases ceteris paribus with the length of time spent on the mountain
summit. Thus the advantage to be derived from taking the mean of ascending and
descending readings—a course which Mr. WHyMPER seems to suggest in some
instances—-is very problematical.

On his p. 51 Mr, Waymrrr gives an example of a Kew aneroid certificate and
then devotes several pages to a criticism of it. On his p. 54 he says, “In the
