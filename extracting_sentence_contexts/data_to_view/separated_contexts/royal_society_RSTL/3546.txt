been exhausted before that occurrence. Hence it becomes matter of inquiry, from
whence it now derives its means of growth 2 Whether it has already sufficient mate-
rials derived from the egg, and stored up within itself for its further development ;
or whether the external inclosing membrane may not still contribute to the function
of nutrition by absorbing fluid condensed from the air of the humid locality in which
it resides? The probability of this last supposition is somewhat countenanced by the
fact, that I have constantly observed the membranes of the embryo at this period
covered with microscopic drops of fluid ; but whether this is fluid condensed on the
membranes from the atmosphere of the dwelling, or whether it results from the trans-
udation of that which was contained in the amnion, remains for future inquiry. Up to this period the embryo gives not the slightest evidence of spontaneous or
voluntary motion. Internally, it is still composed of cells of different sizes, that are
now in the course of producing muscular and other structures.
