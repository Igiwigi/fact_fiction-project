Like Derjaguin’s paper, Johnson's paper was brilliant but contained a wrong
statement that the adhesive interactions should be neglected. Independently of Sperling, Johnson
et al. [10] presented the JKR (Johnson, Kendall and Roberts) theory that united the Derjauguin
energy approach and Johnson’s idea of stress fields superposition (see a discussion by Kendall
[11]). In fact, it was shown that a solution to the adhesive contact problem may be derived using
superposition of two non-adhesive frictionless contact problems: the Hertz solution for contact
between elastic spheres and the Boussinesq solution for a flat-ended cylindrical punch. This
approach to adhesive contact problems will be referred to further as the JKR formalism. Owing
to its simplicity and elegance, the JKR approach is very popular, and it has been referenced in the
literature thousands of times [12].
