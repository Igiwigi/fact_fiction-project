(ii) Income growth projections

While population projections are more reliable owing
to more persistent demographic dynamics, income
growth dynamics are more uncertain. The main
source for these projections is the World Bank Global
economic prospects (2009). The projections are of sub-
stantial per capita income growth, although this is
expected to be lower for all regions during the period
2015-2030 compared with the previous decade.
This result is mainly driven by the fact that income
in the large developing countries is expected to
decelerate slightly. Despite this slowdown, per capita
