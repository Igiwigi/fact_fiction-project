DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES, 461

These numerous F and D relations render it certain that the sets of lines adduced
belong respectively to sets of F series and the D series. Moreover, it suggests that
the source of the 1429, 417 separations is the d sequent or F(«) = 31851'13.

A possible supposition is that their source should be in the S() limit. If so we
should expect it to appear strongly in the S lines, and so in the 8, (2) lines considered
above. As a fact, however, there is no sign of such in either of the 8 groups adduced,
except a very dubious one 1425 between two L.D. lines each of which has an
ambiguity +4. It takes place between 8, = 27964 and 26539 backwards, so that if
its source were here it would be a positive displacement on S() or a negative one
on (2), both unusual. The strongest argument for its source being in the 31851 is
that the separations in question show themselves in all orders of F (m)—in other
words, occur in the limit F (~).

The Value of the Oun—It has already been found that the value of the oun
calculated from the chemist’s atomic weight is 14°47+°01 and that the oun
multiple for A, is 183 or A, = 267°70 +02. This is too small—or the inexactness too
large—to obtain a more accurate value as in the other cases directly from the F or D
mantisse, It is, however, possible to arrive at an extremely accurate estimate by
