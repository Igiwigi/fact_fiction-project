inside the toroidal field coils to increase the plasma-wetted area. ASDEX Upgrade in its turn will
be equipped with an upper divertor such that it can study plasmas in the so-called double-null
configuration. All three devices have the possibility to study multiple geometries. Finding the
optimum divertor geometry is one part of the challenge; the second part is to find a divertor
geometry that is DEMO-compatible as it makes no sense to use a divertor in DEMO that uses
magnetic coils that are placed very close to the plasma and that are therefore very vulnerable to
the neutron bombardment coming from the plasma.

Liquid metal targets are among the new materials that are being investigated [18]. They
have the advantage that the divertor is in principle self-healing in case material is evaporated.
Drawbacks are the possibility of droplets that may enter the plasma and the fact that the desired
flow pattern might be affected by the magnetohydrodynamic forces in the tokamak. It will also be
necessary to develop a scheme in which the loop of the liquid flow is closed so that the material
cannot accumulate in the plasma or the vessel.

EUROfusion is exploiting a range of devices to test plasma-facing components. These include :
the super-conducting Magnum-PSI linear plasma simulator [19], which can mimic heat loads :=
exceeding 10 MW m7? in steady-state conditions as well as pulsed heat loads up to 1GWm~? I=
to mimic Edge Localized Modes. JUDITH [20] can test materials with an intense electron beam, :3
while the superconducting WEST tokamak [21] will test an actively cooled divertor under similar 1p
power loads as in ITER. 8
