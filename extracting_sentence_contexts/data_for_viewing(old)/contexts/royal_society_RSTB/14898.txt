repeatably community-level properties change as a result of species evolution.
Received: 12 August 2022 Here, we review studies of evolution of both natural and experimental commu-

nities and make the case that community-level properties at least sometimes
evolve repeatably. We discuss challenges faced in investigations of evolutionary
repeatability. In particular, only a handful of studies enable us to quantify repeat-

observed degree of repeatability surprising? (ii) How is evolutionary repeatabil-
