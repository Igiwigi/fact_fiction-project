UNIFORM SHEARING MOTION IN A VISCOUS FLUID. 237

if our chosen distribution had agreed accurately with V,. We also see that (18) is
equivalent to

y i[wve V da dy
\| YVEY dx dy

and if in this equation we substitute for Y an expansion of the form (16), we have the
expression
»([s (A, 'P,) . = (A.V!) da dy

a=

\\ BS (AnY,) 3 (A.W?) dar dy

Now this expression, in virtue of the conjugate relations (13), reduces to the form

; vz] A? {| vv VY, dx dy

A= —

or to ‘ RY here (bin ool

So (20) gives the value which we shall obtain for % when an arbitrarily chosen
is inserted in (18),—A, ... , ete. being the constants in the series of type (16) by which
this arbitrarily chosen ¥ is represented. Without seeking to determine A, ...,
etc., we may deduce from (20) that if our assumed ’ is in fact closely identical with a
normal solution ‘V, (so that A, is large in comparison with all the other A’s), then %
will be even more closely identical with 4,. For 4 = % when all the A’s except A,
are zero; and accordingly 4/4, differs from unity by small quantities of the type (A,/A)?,
—that is, by a small quantity of the second order,
