The mean of these three observations is 27-225 per 1000; but this mean number is of
very little consequence, being derived from numbers differing s0 greatly. It is, however,
very surprising that water from the neighbourhood of the supposed Antarctic continent
should have a salinity higher than any one found in the south equatorial regions of the
Atlantic, and only be exceeded by a single one in the North Atlantic regions. IT am
Sure that no material fault exists in the analysis, and this curious fact must thus remain
unexplained until repeated observations in that region shall procure us further informa-
tion. Should the observation be proved to be correct, it would render the existence of
a *Gulf-stream ‚Äù in the Antarctic zone very probable. There is still another peculiarity
in these observations which deserves attention, viz. the great proportion of sulphuric
acid to chlorine.
