& It is evident that Otszewskr's temperatures are uniformly below ours; and we
Bnagine that it may be attributed to his having used a constant-volume thermometer,
-vhereas ours was a constant-pressure one. Mr. Baty, who has made measurements
gf the boiling-points of oxygen and nitrogen with the same thermometer, finds
-gesults that also differ from O1szewski’s by 0°36° for O®, and by 0°15° tor N® in the
“game direction (higher). On the whole, however, we may take OLszewsk1's and our

apour-pressure curves as practically identical, save in the fact that their positions
are not quite coincident.

The Molecular Volumes of Argon, Krypton, and Xenon.

The apparatus by means of which the volume of 1 cub. centim. of each of these
gases at their boiling-points under atmospheric pressure was measured is shown in
the figure (fig. 6).

After the apparatus had been completely exhausted of air through @, which was
connected with the pump, the gas was introduced through an inverted siphon,
and dried in transit with phosphoric anhydride; when a sufficient quantity had
entered, the tube a was sealed. On raising the reservoir b, the volume of the gas
