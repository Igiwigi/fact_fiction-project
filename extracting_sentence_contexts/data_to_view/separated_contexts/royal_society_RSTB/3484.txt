We have seen in the
present paper how striking is the resemblance between the archenteron of Ornitho-

rhynchus and corresponding stages of the reptilian gastrula. We have also shown that
what we have termed the protosomites are in fact derivatives, en masse, from the
archenteric knot ; and that the cavities, actual or potential, found in their interior are
always representatives, or remains, of that originally wide transverse archenteric
lumen so well seen in our fig. 44, Plate 9. Comparison of the foregoing account of v. Spexz’s observations with our statements
of the condition present in Ornithorhynchus can only lead to the conclusion that
the phenomena in the two cases are essentially identical, and that v. Spee was
fully justified in his conviction that the appearances he met with were not due to
merely fortuitous arrangements.
