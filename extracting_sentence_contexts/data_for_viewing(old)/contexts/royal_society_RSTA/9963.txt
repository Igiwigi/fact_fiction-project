investigations of later years, which are generally considered the most important for
the estimate of the value of the surface- tension.

The table shows rather considerable deviations between the values found by the
different investigators. As an explanation of these deviations, the question of the
purity of the surface has been among the most prominent, relying on the fact that the
tension of a water-surface may decrease very considerably when the surface becomes
contaminated with even an extremely smail amount of foreign substances. This
circumstance, however, does not seem sufficient to explain the deviations among the
values found by authors who have used the same method for purifying the surface
(e.g., GRUNMACH and KaLAune; Foro and Zioprcox1).

The fact that a number of authors (e.g., VoLKMANN, Dorsry, Forcx) who have
worked with different methods have found such exceedingly good conformity among
the results of their single experiments after all seems to show that the surface-tension
of a carefully purified surface is a very constant quantity. This assumption is further
confirmed by the circumstance that several authors (KALAHNE, Dorsgy, &c.) have
uot found any sensible diminishing of the surface-tension during the time of the
experiment.

The results of the investigations by Miss A. Pockxens,* Lord Ray.ercu,f and
F. Nansevt on the influence of contaminations upon the tension of a water-surface
seem also highly to point in this direction.

In consequence of the above-mentioned, it therefore seems that a great deal of the
