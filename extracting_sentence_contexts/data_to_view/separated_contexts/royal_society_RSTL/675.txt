I am not aware that the law of the diurnal variation of the
temperature of the atmosphere at sea, has been described by
any writer, From the numerous observations, which I had
an opportunity of making, between and bordering on the tro-
pics, it appeared to me perfectly regular at a great distance
from land, when the weather was fine, and the wind steady. In these circumstances, I found the air at its maximum tem-
perature precisely at noon, and at its minimum towards sun-
rise. I shall give in illustration of the fact two instances from
my note book. April ad. S. lat. 21? g‚Äù.
