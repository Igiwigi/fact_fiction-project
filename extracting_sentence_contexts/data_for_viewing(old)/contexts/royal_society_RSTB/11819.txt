Experiment 3. In Experiment 2, we found a sex-specific differ-
ence of dispersal syndrome in terms of body size, with
dispersers being significantly larger only in females but not
in males. However, Experiment 3 revealed that the body
size of the males and females of the dispersal selected popu-
lations were not different from the males and females of the
VBCs (figure 1c; electronic supplementary material, table
S1), thus suggesting a change in the pattern of sex-specific
dispersal syndrome. More critically, contrary to the expec-
tations from literature [25,31,60], neither males nor females
in dispersal-selected populations had a greater body size
than the corresponding controls. One potential reason for
this might be the fact that under our standard nutrition, the
flies have access to ad libitum resources at any given point,
and therefore do not need to acquire and store greater
amount of resources in the body. This automatically leads
to the prediction that if selection for dispersal were to

happen under nutrient-limited condition, the dispersal
syndrome with respect to body size might be very different.

For desiccation resistance, a number of interesting and con-
trasting observations were obtained in Experiment 3. First,
contrary to the ecological dispersal syndrome (Experiment 2,
figure 1e), desiccation resistance of the dispersal-selected
