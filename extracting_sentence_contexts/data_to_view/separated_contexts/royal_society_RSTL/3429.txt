We ee from the preceding abstracts, that the values of x never rise 80 high as
two, but approach toward it accordingly as the breaking weight becomes smaller. In the pillars *77 inch diameter and 604 inches long, where the length is seventy-
eight times the diameter, the value of x is 1'805 in one case, and 1843 in another ;
and in the pillars *50 inch diameter, and 604 inches long, the length being one hun-
dred and twenty-one times the diameter, the value of = is 1:914. These facts, and
the regular increase in the value of x according as the breaking weight is dimi-
nished, show that 2 is the value to which z would approximate if the breaking weight
were infinitely small, or the body perfectly incompressible. Computations of the Strength of Long Pillars by means of the preceding Numerical
