Upon showing the bar 80 changed to those
who were best acquainted with the working of this metal, they universally
ascribed it to the action of sulphur : but nobody could explain to me why this
action should require such a very intense heat ; as up to the temperature of
melting cast iron, to which it had several times been exposed, no change took
place ; but the bar remained perfectly soft and malleable. In Dz Fzrussac's Bulletin for November 1830, there is an abstract of my
paper on the Pyrometer, which the Editor concludes with the observyation,
that * unfortunately I inclosed in the crucible which contained the register

and the bar of platinum some pieces of iron, without being aware of the fact,
which is known to all the workmen who manufacture platinum, that the mere
presence of iron/is enough to communicate brittleness to that metal.” Upon inquiry amongst workmen in this country | I cannot find that such
a property has ever been observed in the course of their experience ; and
when I consider that the bar in the cavity of the register was perfectly pre-
| served from contact with the iron nails ; and moreoyer, that it had actually
been plunged into melted iron without any change of properties ; I cannot
