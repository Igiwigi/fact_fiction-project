Further experiments with different combinations of metals should afford confirma-
tion of this theory. The more plastic the metals, the smaller will be the pressures in the
region of contact and hence the less the extent of breakdown of the lubricant film. The
position is complicated by the fact that the strength of the adsorbed film will vary for
different metals, and also by the fact that at the points where the film breaks down
three distinct types of metallic junction may occur, depending on the nature of the
metals. Nevertheless, in general, we might expect that as metals of greater plasticity
are employed the protection afforded by any lubricant would become greater, the
frictional behaviour tending more and more to resemble that shown by long-chain
fatty acids on steel. It has been shown that the extent of the wear varies for different substances but that
even with the best lubricants some tearing of the surfaces is observed.
