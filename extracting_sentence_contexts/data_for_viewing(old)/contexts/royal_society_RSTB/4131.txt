best adapted, receives great support from the facts which have been brought forward
in the present paper.

It is true that these facts have chiefly been used to show that local commonness, on
the whole, increases with age, but as the commonest species are those of wide distribu-
tion, the next commonest those developed somewhere in Ceylon and Peninsular India,
and the least common those confined to Ceylon, we may take it as extremely probable
that wide distribution also goes with commonness, and therefore with age. 1t hardly
needs pointing out that quite possibly some of the species that are now of wide
distribution originated in Ceylon in very early times. The Ceylon endemics have not
yet nearly reached the stage of average distribution ; only, perhaps, when they have
become so old that the difference in age between them and the other species has
become negligible, will they do so. The facts of distribution would seem to indicate
that the time still required to reach average dispersal would be at least,as long
as the average time between the arrival of the widely distributed species and
those also found in Peninsular India, whatever time that may have been. As the
Ceylon endemics climb the scale some of the widely distributed species will be forced
to descend.

One may, perhaps, imagine that the various species that occur in Ceylon will all
the time be becoming more and more accustomed to the local conditions, by natural
selection acting on fluctuating variation, but in any case this cannot amount to much,
or cause any structural differences between them.
