accidental contamination did not occur, one is almost forced to conclude that some
accessory factor of an unrecognised nature must have been operative in their experi-
ments; a factor absent in my own repetition of their work and absent from the studies
of every other mycologist who has carried out critical experimental investigations on
these fungi.

Furthermore, as has been pointed out, these investigators emphasise the fact that
their mutations are not of the nature of specific reactions to definite chemical or
physical stimuli, but only the results of a generalised interference with the normal
course of life of the organism. Thus ScHIEMANN(69) says: “ ... so zeigt sich als
ein Gemeinsames, dass in allen Fillen, wo derartige Farbinderungen auftraten,
Stérungen der normalen Lebens-verhaltnisse vorlagen. Es ist deshalb der Schluss
berechtigt, dass die Mutation in den beobachteten Fallen durch einen starken Reiz
ausgelést wurde.” But the experience of other investigators demonstrates the
extreme genetic constancy of species of these fungi even when placed for many
generations under the most unfavourable conditions. Numerous workers have shown
that the morphological facies and physiological activities of fungi may within certain
limits be changed at will in the single generation, but in no case, with the above
exceptions, have these phenotypic modifications had any effect whatever on the
