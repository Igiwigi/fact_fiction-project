For the particular case of revolving electrons 2m/e has the value 1-13 x 10-7.

Accurate experimental determination of this ratio is difficult. The values so far
obtained, while differing among themselves, are, in general, lower than the theoretical
ratio for electrons; the more dependable lying near to one-half of that quantity—so
near indeed that the chief interest attaching to them now is in the question whether
their value is exactly one-half or only approximately so.

The following is the account of an attempt to re-determine the ratio from this point
of view.

The chief experimental difficulty lies, of course, in the fact that the reaction impulse
tends to be masked, or-at least seriously modified, by the disturbing forces consequent
on the change of magnetism.

Three methods of obtaining its value appear to be available.

(a) A ballistic method (used by Stewart) in which the impulse turns a vertical
cylinder against the twist of a delicate fibre by which it is suspended.
