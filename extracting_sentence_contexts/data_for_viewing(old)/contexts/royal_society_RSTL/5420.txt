28. I return now to the expressions for the refractive index

EO LS] Ae;
SPS eq I+s

In the first place, it will be remarked that these differ from the value which is
usually adopted, namely, =
1

I confess I always considered that the usual mode of deducing this value from the
spread of the wave, which in fact does not spread, was more elegant than conclusive,
It is connected, if I mistake not, with the idea that the transverse front of a wave of
light, as of a wave of sound, consists of particles all of which are in the same phase ;

* Nevertheless it is worth observing, that at the critical angle (compare No. 39), in the case of 8=s,, it
results from the formule that the absorbing power of the medium has no effect in diminishing the vis viva
when the ray is turned through an angle 7â€”29 in the operation of reflexion, and this is true both for the
primary and secondary rays. I am therefore inclined to think, and other considerations confirm me in that
opinion, that the absorbing medium acts something like a file in thinning off the absorbed portions of the ray, and
requires that the ray should penetrate into its substance before it can exercise any absorbing action upon it.
