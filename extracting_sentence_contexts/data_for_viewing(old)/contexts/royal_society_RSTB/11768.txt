maintenance, monitoring and manipulating. Barbey et al.
found that intact dIPFC was crucial only for the manipulation
of verbal and spatial information in WM (left dIPFC), and for
the manipulation of information in tests of arithmetic and
spatial reasoning (right dIPFC). Lesions of the dIPFC had
no effect on performance in maintenance and monitoring
tasks: patients with dIPFC lesions could repeat a sequence
of digits in order, could repeat a sequence of tapping different
locations on a board in order and could indicate whether the
most recent item of a visually presented sequence of letters
matched a target stimulus [90].

In the light of these findings, the fact that dIPFC acti-
vation disappeared in Frassle et al.’s passive viewing
condition [111] does not necessarily mean that the content
of the subjects’ experiences were not cognitively accessed,
as relevant information maintenance—and in the light of
the Barbey et al. study [90], even monitoring—could have
occurred without dIPFC activity.

(c) Diminished P3b signal and cognitive access
Although in the access versus no-access literature, the P3b
signal is linked to fronto-parietal activity [55], its neural
generators are, in fact, debated. Some localize the source
of the P3b signal to parietal-temporal regions [136],
