In that specimen the vascular zone
surrounding the central medulla has a diameter of *2, from which figure all these
cylinders increase steadily in diameter, in the number of their component vessels, and
in the dimensions of the cellular medulla which they enclose, until we reach the largest
axial bundles of the arborescent stems. * The fact that all the specimens hitherto
found below a certain diameter have the 80lid vascular bundle whilst all above that
* This increase seems to be partly explained by what I have said on p. 466 about fig. 20.
