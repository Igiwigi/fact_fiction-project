As an example,
it appears that protein-coded genes are almost as complex in sea anemones as in
humans (Technau 2008). The distinction may well be related to the small RNAs
that protect the genome from transposes and show a high degree of evolutionary
flexibility (Grimson et al. 2008). The key for such behaviour seems to lie in
the fact that even very simple systems, such as illustrated above in the case
of simple harmonic chains with competing springs, lead already to bifurcations
and dynamic complexity. This argument has already been made some time ago
by May & Oster (1976) and has lost none of its significance. Complexity may not,
in the sense as discussed here, lead to novel behaviour, but when complexity is
combined with multi-scaling, it may well produce phenomena that go far beyond
our current expectations.
