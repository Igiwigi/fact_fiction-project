of 0°0058 thermal unit. Referring to the equation expressing the value of C, in
terms of temperature derived from the experiments upon gas at this density, we find
C, at 50° = 0°1971 and at 90° = 0°1894, or the fall has been 0:0077 thermal unit.
The agreement is only approximate. However, the thermodynamic equation and the
experiments agree in showing that the variation of specific heat with temperature at
low densities is inappreciable ; thus the variable term at the density 000188 is almost
inappreciable in value, and its changes, of course still more so. At 0° C, it has the
value 0:0007, at 50° C. the value 0°0004, and at 90° C. 0:0003.

Again, if we evaluate the variable term in the case of the density being 0°0800—
the second equi-density line on the plate—it is found that the sensibly rectilinear
plotting of the experiments is in agreement with theory. The fall in the specific heat
between about 10° and 100° C. calculates, in fact, to be 0°00103. This is a far wider
range than the range of mean temperatures in the experiments. The experiments did
not cover more than half this range, and must have been competent to show a varia-
tion of one part in 2000 upon values of @ lying between 0°223 and 0:054 grammes.
This was hardly to have been expected. And this applies more forcibly to the lowest
line, the density 0°0456.

On endeavouring to apply the thermodynamic equation to the line p = 0°180, it
appeared that it was less agreeable with the experiments. The reason of this is
probably to be found in the inapplicability of the formula to serve as the equation of
the gas at high pressures, It is, in fact, based upon ReGNavuut’s observations. Nor
