For example, 6 days of
monocular or binocular deprivation increases intrinsic excit-
ability of L2/3 pyramidal neurons in binocular V1, as
revealed by increased spiking to somatic current injection
(F-I curves). This reflects both higher input resistance and
reduced spike threshold [66]. Briefer MD (1-3 days) does
not alter intrinsic excitability in binocular V1 [66] but does
in monocular V1 [63], perhaps reflecting the fact that binocu-
lar V1 is still receiving open-eye input. Thus, homeostatic
regulation of pyramidal cell excitability can occur in vivo,
although it is a relatively slow process when networks still
receive some sensory input. Prolonged deprivation, therefore,
drives FRH in L2/3 of binocular V1 through both increased
intrinsic excitability and excitatory synaptic scaling [66].
