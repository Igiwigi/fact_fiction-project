REPORT OF THE MONTE ROSA EXPEDITION OF 1911. 89

The striking fact is that after 20 minutes the meionexy had passed off; the figure
obtained after two and a half hours depends upon a single determination, but it is
probably of value as showing that MArTHIson was not meionectic, though not sufficient
to establish pleonexy. Although 20 minutes sufficed to bring the reaction of Marutsoy’s blood back to
approximately its normal value, the blood itself was profoundly altered. The pressure .
of carbonic acid was much less than it had formerly been. ‘The question naturally
arises, What evidence was there of increase of other acid to take its place ?
