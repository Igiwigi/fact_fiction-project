the blue-violet to the extreme red end of the spectrum. The rotations are therefore
negative for the bornyl xanthate and positive for the menthyl xanthate throughout the
whole range of visual readings from Li 6708 to Hg 4358 and beyond. Within this
range the dispersion is therefore apparently normal, since the rotations increase
progressively with decreasing wave-length; but this is only because the anomalies

have been displaced to longer wave-lengths. This conclusion was confirmed by the
fact that a reversal of sign was detected in the methylene bornyl ester, IV, at about
7000 A., where a zero reading was observed, whilst a small positive rotation, « = 0:06,
[x] = 0-2, was observed at about 7100 A., using a carbon arc as a source of red light.
In the region of absorption, however, the curves of rotatory dispersion are of just the
same type as those referred to above.

(d) Astill further displacement is observed in the diphenyl dithiourethanes, where the
first absorption band is shifted into the visible spectrum, so that the solutions have a
strong red colour. The anomalies associated with the Corron phenomenon are therefore
also displaced into the visible spectrum, so that TscHuGAEFE* was able to observe the
anomalous rotations and Bruna} to measure also the circular dichroism in the region
covered by the band. But the absorption by the second absorption band is too great
to permit of photographic readings of either property in the ultra-violet. Apart from
