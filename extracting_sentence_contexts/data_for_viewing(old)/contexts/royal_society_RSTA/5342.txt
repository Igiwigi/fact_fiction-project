(equivalent columns in the MSA). This is achieved by compressing identical sites into site patterns
and assigning them a corresponding weight. This can be done because duplicate sites yield exactly
the same likelihood iff they evolve under the same statistical model of evolution. When two
sites are identical, this means that the leaves of the tree are labelled equally. Consider a forest
of trees with the same topology, where, for each tree, the labels are defined by the molecular data
stored at a particular site of the MSA and the position of the tips. Knowing equivalent subtrees
within such a forest would allow someone to minimize the number of operations required to
compute the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree. This can be seen as a generalization of the site
compression technique.

Our contribution. In this article, we extend the series of results presented in [8,9] by introducing
an algorithm that computes all subtree repeats in unrooted unordered labelled trees in linear time and
space. The importance of our contribution is underlined by the fact that the presented algorithm
can be easily modified to work on trees that do not satisfy some or any of the above assumptions
on the tree structure, e.g. it can be applied to rooted, ordered or unlabelled trees. A preliminary
version of this article appeared in [16].

2. Preliminaries

(a) Basic definitions

An unrooted unordered tree is an undirected unordered acyclic-connected graph T =(V,E),
where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges such that EC V x V with |E| =|V| — 1. The
number of nodes of a tree T is denoted by |T|:=|V|. An alphabet ¥ is a finite, non-empty set
whose elements are called symbols. A string over an alphabet ¥ is a finite, possibly empty, string
