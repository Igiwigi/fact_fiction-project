SrarkewrrscH found that a similar change was caused
by prolonged starvation. Of the others, PiscHiINGER and Mankowsky agree with
LewascHew as to the reconstitution of alveoli from the islets during rest ;
TscHAssowNiKow and Doeren regard the islets as consisting of cells in process of
degeneration, terminating in absorption. The embryological investigations of LacuEsse(15) led him to conclusions of a
somewhat similar nature. _ Already, in 1887, Bizzozero and VasaLE(16) had
pointed out that the islets were abundant in guinea-pig embryos—a fact which, at
first sight, seems to tell strongly against LewascHrw’s view, and has, indeed, been
held to do so (Oppri(17)). LaGuersse, who first gave to these structures the name
of “islets (tlots) of Langerhans,” described the histogeny of the pancreas in the sheep
and the trout. In the sheep embryo the primitive buds, from the anastomosing
tubules which form the pancreatic rudiment, are described as being of the nature of
islets (#ots primaires).
