The smaller the phase,
moreover, the less will be the projection of the twilight at

light of the illuminated hemisphere as to; be almost evanescent;
The best illustration of this, and. of the known. fact, that in
the broader phases the twilight will, on. account. of the strong
contrasting light of the luminous part, vanish-eyen at. the
cusps, is given by the spots Manilius and Menelaus. - Both are
situated near the centre of the hemisphere turned: towards our
earth ; both have considerable diameters, the. one- of 24, and
the other of between 14, and 16 seconds, and both appear very
distinctly on the third day after the new moon, with a degree
of light rather surpassing that of the twilight... These spots,
however, notwithstanding| their great diameters, vanish. on ac-
count of the increasing glare. of light, so s00n as four days after
the new. moon, although they be then still at. s0me distance
from the terminating border.* How could,,.therefore, a faint
light, measuring only - 2/7 in breadth, be. yisible /on the third
day after a new moon, at the terminating border ?\ And how

could it at the fourth day still, appear distinetly at, the bright

cusps, where it is, indeed, of a more considerable extent, but
still must, in consequence of its pyramidal form, s00n dwindle
away into a very narrow tapering stripe? This, moreover,
was precisely the case in the -many observations.
