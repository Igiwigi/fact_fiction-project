spect of the relative quantities of electricity displaced at given distances, which will
be noticed in another place (32.).

If we place at the extremity b, of the cylinder N, three or more consecutive insulated
8lices, insulating them on glass rods, in any convenient way as in fig. 4., and then
proceed to examine the electrical state of these slices whilst under the influence of
the charged body, the electricity of the distant extremity d, will frequently be found
extending up to the last section Ã¾; and, contrary perhaps to what we might expect,
the point to which the electricity of the distant extremity d extends toward b, will be
greater as the intensity of M is greater and its distance from N less, as if the displaced
electricity not being enabled to pass freely off in the direction b d, supposing M posi-
tively charged, was continually, as it were, bounding back or reverberating upon the
extremity b, a fact which may be further observed in the following experiment.

Exp. 8. Oppose a cylindrical conductor D, fig. 5., about three feet in length and
four inches in diameter, to an electrified cylinder C, charged with positive electricity.
Test the state of different points of this cylinder D by touching it with a tangent disc
of very small thickness. If we ascertain in this way the first point at which the elec-
tricity evinced is negative, we sball find on bringing the charged cylinder C within a
less distance, or otherwise increasing its intensity, that the same- point will become
positive. The same thing occurs in increasing the extent of the opposed areas at the
extremities of the cylinders, until at last the points immediately in the vicinity of the
opposed end will become poxsitive.

* In these experiments it is better to detach first the central portions M or N whilst under induction, when
