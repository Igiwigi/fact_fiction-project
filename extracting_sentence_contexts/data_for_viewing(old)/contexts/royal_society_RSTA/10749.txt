as wire (1); the length was very nearly the same, viz., 65°7 centims. Just before
fracture the values of B, and W under the torsion due to 100 revolutions were
B, = 1050, W = 383, and when the wire had freed itself from stress, By = 960,
W = 383. After fracture the values fell to B, = 787, W = 302, the changes being
much smaller than those for specimen (1). It seems probable that the diminution
of B, and W which occurs on fracture is due to the violent jar which attends the
fracture.

The values of both B, and W in (2a) and (2b) are for large twists very much
smaller than the corresponding values in (1). It is true that the permeability of (2)
before it was strained, viz, ~ = 1304 for Hy = 5, is much less than the value
p = 1694 for (1) under the same conditions. But the great difference between
(1) and (2) in respect to B, and W for large twists can hardly be due to this fact.
It is more likely due to the untwisting of the wire at the various stages of the
process.

When the wire had been twisted we found just as for (1) that W diminishes con-
siderably even after 20 cycles of magnetisation. We took 20 cycles in each case
before making the tests for B) and W, but if W is still diminishing with continued
reversals, it is hardly possible to assign any very definite value to it.

The wire, initially quite pliable, was very stiff after it had been broken by
twisting. Its length originally was 65:7 centims., and this was increased by the
torsion to 66°9 centims. The mean diameter diminished from ‘0796 to ‘0793 inch.
Thus the volume of the wire increased by about 1 per cent.
