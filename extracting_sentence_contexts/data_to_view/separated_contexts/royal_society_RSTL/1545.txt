It
is probable that it does not produce its effects, until it enters
the substance of the brain, along with the blood, in which it is
dissolved ; nor will the experiments of the Abbe FoxTanA, in
which he found the ticunas produce almost instant death when
injected into the jugular vein of a rabbit, be found to militate
against this conclusion, when we consider how short is the
distance, which, in 80 small an animal, the blood has to pass
from the jugular vein to the carotid artery, and the great
rapidity of the circulation; since in a rabbit under the influence
of terror, during such an experiment, the heart cannot be
Supposed to act $0 seldom as three times in a second,

I have made no experiments to ascertain through what
medium other poisons when applied to wounds affect the vital
organs, but from analogy we may suppose that they enter the
circulation through the divided blood-vessels. IV. The facts already related led me to conclude that alcohol,
the essential oil of almonds, the juice of aconite, the oil of
tobacco, and the woorara, occasion death simply by destroy-
ing the functions of the brain. The following experiment
appears fully to establish the truth of this conclusion. Exp. go.
