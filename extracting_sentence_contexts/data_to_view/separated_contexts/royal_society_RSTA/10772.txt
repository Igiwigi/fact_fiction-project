Sn 27. 40°8 per cent. of tin. In the cooling curve of this alloy the second and third halts are completely merged
into one. In fact, the solidus and the liquidus meet very near here at the
temperature of the G point, and the possibility of a uniform solid solution ceases,
The meeting of these two curves at the G temperature is, as Professor Roozesoom
has pointed out to us, a theoretical necessity. Sn 27. Sic. chill at 700° (not reproduced).
