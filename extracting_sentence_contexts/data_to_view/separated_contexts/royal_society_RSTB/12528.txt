Mathematical translation rules between different

approximate additive model of fitness [8], thus obtaining an simultaneously translations between different causal perspec-

approximate model for evolutionary change. So, if we break tives that can be applied under regression, additive and weak

down the process into steps, what looks like differentiation selection models. I have previously argued that, although

of the fitness function is in fact something relatively complex perhaps easiest to initially derive using direct fitness kin

and by no means obvious. We have gone from a static selection formalism [36], models of gamete evolution under

description of fitness to a model that tracks change of pheno- gamete competition and gamete limitation [32], and local

type over time under weak selection. From this perspective, it mate competition sex allocation models [83], can both benefit

no longer seems very puzzling that differentiation reveals from an MLS interpretation.
