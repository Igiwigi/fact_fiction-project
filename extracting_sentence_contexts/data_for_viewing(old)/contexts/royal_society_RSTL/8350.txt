have ever been actually seen and identified. The ingenious attempts of PasTEUR and
others to demonstrate germs in the air are manifestly illusory, Like them I have
repeatedly collected air-dust and found abundance of molecules, circles, spheres, and
particles of various kinds under the microscope ; but these could not be identified as
true spores, nor distinguished from particles of inert dust. Indeed the objects sought
after are 80 minute and 80 wanting in characteristic forms, that such a search, with our
present instruments, appears well-nigh hopeless*,

But although an obscurity hangs over the precise nature of these particles, the reality
of their existence is not doubtful ; nor is it doubtful that the ordinary development of
Bacteria and Toruls is directly due to their agency. These fundamental Propositions
of the panspermic theory may be regarded as the expression of acquired facts in
SCICNce.

1 come now to deal with those cases which have hitherto proved a stumbling-
block to the general acceptance of the panspermic theory—namely, the development of
Bacteria (without the possibility of fresh infection) in liquids and mixtures which have
been subjected to a boiling heat.

It is truly, as Dr. HuGuss BENNEvT has remarked, a * violent assumption ” that living
particles can survive a boiling heat. Nevertheless it is an assumption that-may be justified -
both on grounds already supplied in the preceding sections and by direct experiment.
The @ priori argument stands thus:—Take milk. It has been shown that pure milk, drawn
without extraneous contamination from the teat, has no germinating power. The ger-
