Srisible, the double green line near D being also occasionally seen. D was intensely
Sbrilliant, and the alt fumed away from the pole in a dense white smoke.

S The following day a fresh attack with more powerful apparatus was made. One of
=Apy's 6-inch quantity coils and a jar with about 224 square inches of coated surface
Syere employed with a powerful battery of five one-pint Grove's cells. The results,
:Showever, went exactly in the same way. Na I and Na Br gave all the metallic lines of
Sodium, which were very brilliant; whilst Na Cl gave D and the double red very bright,
Zand stretching all across the spectrum. Na F gave also D and the double red line; but
Bthe latter only extended three quarters across the spectrum, and neither D nor the red
line was 80 bright as they were in the chloride. Further observations showed that under
Zcertain circumstances all the lines appeared even in these latter salts; but they were 80
Sdim as to be scarcely visible, and the fact of these compounds behaving in direct contra-
Syention to the observations with lead was established.

TiTHUM.

Â£4 The following experiments were made with lithic iodide and chloride in coal-gas.

s Lithic Todide gave the red line of this metal, 6705, extending all across the spectrum,
S but it was very faint. 6102, the orange line, was very brilliant and about two thirds
ZE across. 4603, the blue line, was very short and nebulous when seen, which was only on
S one occasion. 'This differs but little from the spectrum given by the metal itself, except
that the lines are in the latter case much brighter, and that the red and orange extend
right across the spectrum, and the blue three quarters across.
