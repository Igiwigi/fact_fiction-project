3 the probable changes that occur in passing from the one to the other, clearly in view, I

S It-is-an -undisputed fact that active Bacteria are killed by a temperature far below

= period of latency, is necessary to enable the hardy and resistant germ to pass into that
4 organic condition in which it is 80 sensitive to heat. There can hardly be a doubt that the
EZ nearer the germ approaches the moment when it is to emerge as the finished organism,

Z hours. Supposing the heat of boiling water, or even a lower heat than that of
A boiling water, to be applied to the germ immediately before its final development, when

all its parts are plastic, when it is, in short, on the point of reaching a stage at which
