We now recognize that, at the absolute zero of temperature, a metal sharply
and fundamentally differs from a non-metal with respect to its accessible spectrum of electronic
energy levels. The ground state of a metal comprises a continuous spectrum of electronic energy states. This explains the striking fact that in a metal the application of even the weakest electrical field
produces an electrical current due to transitions to adjacent electronic levels in the continuum
of electronic energy states. By contrast, the energy spectrum of a dielectric, i.e. a non-metal, is
characterized by the existence of a finite electronic energy gap between levels. Thus, a rigorous
criterion to distinguish between a metal and a non-metal can exist only at T=O0K.
