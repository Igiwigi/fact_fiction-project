DR. E. B. WILSON ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENILLA. 807

Tt has already been stated that the primary zooid is almost always larger and more
perfectly developed than the secondary zooids derived from it. If, then, the secondary
zooid owes its rudimentary structure to inheritance from a, slightly more advanced bud,
may not the primary zooid, as Dr. W. K. Brooks has s8wggested to me, have been
produced by the multiplication of a still more perfect bud, like the zooid, for instance,
of Halisceptrum which possesses a pair of mesenterial filaments ? This in turn may
have been formed by the multiplication of a more highly organised bud, and 80 on
until a fully developed polyp stood at the beginning of the series. This will be
rendered more clear by an illustration, in the consideration of which it is necessary to
bear clearly in mind the fact that the immature bud of the sexual polyp performs the

Azame function as the zooid and that this function is of vital importance to the
YGorganism.

Suppose a secondary bud, A, to give rise by asexual multiplication to a tertiary bud,
&B, which remained longer in a rudimentary state and developed less perfectly than A,
Sand hence performed more perfectly the function of taking in water. In a succeeding
generation B gives rise to still more rudimentary individuals, C, and 80 on through
Smany generations until true zooids, permanently rudimentary, were produced. The
Zfunetions of the rudimentary and of the fully developed individuals being entirely
Sdifferent, the interme liate or transitional forms would perform both functions less
Eporkootly. They would therefore tend to disappear by natural selection until a colony
