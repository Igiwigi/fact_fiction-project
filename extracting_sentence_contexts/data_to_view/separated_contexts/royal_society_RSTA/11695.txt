Theory, which is well understood, indicates the following conditions for maximum
sensitiveness :—
(1.) The magnetic force per unit current should be a maximum.
(2.) The magnetic moment of each member of the suspended system should be a
maximum. S (3.) The mirror should, if possible, be so good that its defining power is only limited
its size; it should be optically perfect.
"E (4.) The optical magnification should be a maximum.
2.(5.) The astaticism of the suspended system should be a maximum.
6.) The field in which the suspended system moves should be zero when the
astaticism is perfect, and the directional force entirely due to the unavoidable torsion
rad the suspending fibre. Since the astaticism is never perfect, and the field can never
& zero, the torsion of the suspended fibre can only operate so as to reduce the sensi-
Breness, and must therefore be made as nearly zero as possible.
74 It is obvious that the above conditions are partially incompatible, and, as a matter
“Sf fact, it is the last condition which provides a starting-point.
& The line of argument is this. In order to prevent changes of zero, we are compelled
‘ use quartz threads. These threads are, however, very stiff.
