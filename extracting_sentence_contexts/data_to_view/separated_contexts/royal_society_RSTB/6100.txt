70 M.SNOW AND R. SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS

usually made contacts 1, 2 and 3 (that is—they made contact with the first, second,
and third older leaves) ; I, and later leaves usually made contacts 2 and 3, as in
Nos. 90 and 124A, though in a few apices they made contacts 1, 2 and 3. Thus
there was usually a gradual change from a system of contacts 1 and 2, to one of
contacts 2 and 3, and this was due to the fact that the older leaves covered larger arcs
than the younger ones. Probably this was partly because the regenerating apex
was at first small, and then gradually regained a normal size : but some allowance
