Il. On the Structure and Uses of the "Spleen. By Everard
Home, Esq. F. R.S.

Read November 26, 1897.

Is bringing forward a fact of 80 much importance, as a com-
munication between the cardiac portion of the $tomach and;the
circulation. of the blood; through the medium, of the spleen,
I shall not- take up the: time of , the, Society, by, offering any
preliminary: observations, but/sate, the, circumstances which
led to: the diseovery,- and; the.,experiments,. by which the
different facts have been. ascertained,

During the investigation of the functions of the stomach,
(in which 1 have. been. lately engaged,). it was found that
while digestion is, going on, there is. a, separation between the
cardiac and pyloric portions, either by means of a permanent
or muscular contraction. [This fact placed the process of
digestion in a new light, and led me to consider in what way
the quantities of different liquors, which are s0 often taken
into the stomach, can be prevented from being mixed with
the half digested food, and interfering with the formation of
chyle.
