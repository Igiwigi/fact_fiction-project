By these experiments it is ascertained, that a low negatiye
power of electricity separates from, the serum of the. blood an.
alkaline solution of albumen ; that a low positive power sepa-
rates albumen with acid, and the salts of the blood. That with
one degree of power, albumen is separated in a, solid form,
with a less degree, it is separated in a fluid form. From these facts, the following queries are: proposed.

_ 18t. That such, decomposition of the blood by electricity,
may be as near an approach to secretion, as could be expected
to be produced by the artificial means at present- in our
power,

2d. That a weaker power of electricity, than any that can
be readily kept up by art, may be capable of separating from


of animal Secretions. 391

the blood, the different parts of which it is composed, and
forming new combinations of the parts s0 separated.

--. 3d.” That the structure of the nerves may fit them to have
a low electrical power, which can be employed for that pur-
pose, and as such low powers are not influenced by imperfect
conductors, as animal fluids, the nerves will not be robbed of
their electricity by the surrounding parts.
