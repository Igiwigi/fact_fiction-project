mathematical arguments could be developed [5]. By contrast, for large systems of coupled
oscillators, which are our main target of study, no mathematical theory equally rigorous to the
one-oscillator theory seems to exist. Therefore, it seems difficult to proceed further without relying
upon some unverifiable intuition.

We consider first diffusively coupled homogeneous fields of oscillators with sufficient spatial
extension described typically with reaction-diffusion equation X = F(X) + DV?X, where X is
now a function of spatial coordinate r and time t, and D is a matrix of diffusion coefficients.
Mathematically, how to do reduction for such systems may seem desperately difficult as


compared with the reduction of a single oscillator. This difficulty could be imagined, e.g. from the
fact that we do not have a clear concept of infinite-dimensional centre manifold. Incidentally, the
naming ‘centre-manifold reduction’ commonly used may therefore be inappropriate for many-
oscillator problems. Instead, we sometimes used the term ‘reductive perturbation’ in the past,
although this term will not be used in this article.

From a physicist’s point of view, reduction of reaction—diffusion systems can be achieved only
by slightly modifying the reduction of single oscillator dynamics. Let us confine our arguments to
the reaction—diffusion equation. The key idea is that we still treat the problem as a one-oscillator
problem by regarding the diffusion coupling DV2X as a weak perturbation acting on a local
oscillator. Here again, the assumed weakness of the diffusion coupling could only be justified
a posteriori by making use of what is expected physically, that the length scale of the spatial
variation of X will become increasingly longer as the Hopf bifurcation is approached.
