However, given that environments under laboratory con-
ditions are tightly controlled, such a situation is extremely
unlikely.

The idea that same-generation phenotypic associations
may not always be a good predictor of the direction of evol-
utionary responses has been empirically examined before
[63]. However, it had never been tested in the context of
dispersal syndromes or their sex differences.
