merely act as a corrective on the other in the examination of the primitive Palaeozoic
species and genera. As I have already said, I use Zaphrentede practically with the
limits of Zaphrentoidea, Nicwoson, similarly Cyathophylliide as the equivalent in
the main of Cyathophylloidea, NicHoLson ; but Cystiphyllide only with the special
meaning which is attached to the family of the same name by Professor NicHoLson.

T have seen it stated, in several lately-published papers on Paleozoic corals, that
the genus Heliophyllum may be incorporated with Cyathophyllum. It is said that
the carine of Heliophyllum are not sufficient reason for a separation. I place
considerable importance on the carinze as a starting-point of a variation within the
Cyathophyllide: which may have been the origin of the main differences in the
structures of recent Astreids and Fungidie, But, in addition to this feature, there
is the fact that in Helophyllum the pinnate insertion of the septa is strongly marked
throughout growth, whereas in the typical species of Cyathophyllum, which ought to
be regarded as the standard of the genus, pinnate insertion is not observed in the
mature calyx. NrcHo.soy, on the other hand, made two distinct familiesâ€”-Cyatho-
phyllidxe and Heliophyllide. I would certainly be inclined to regard them as sub-
families,

In the Clisiophyllide (NicuH.), in addition to the columellar avea, a point may again
be made of the invariable pinnate insertion of septa.

The following families have been already treated in full systematic detail in Part [.,
and their characteristic features will be found summerized in the Table (p. 252).
Short diagnoses may be repeated here.
