In describing the formation of the salivary gland I mentioned
the changed character of the cells of the somatic part of the somite at a very early
stage, and I regard this early change as indicating that the process does not represent
the gradual alteration of the somatic part of the somite into a tubular salivary gland,
but rather a sudden loss of the character of the somite, and the assumption of the
character of a different organ. In other words, the difference from the other somites
observed at so early a period, indicates an abbreviation of development, some inter-
mediate stage having dropped out. One of the most interesting points about the development of the somites is the fact
that the so-called double segments have two mesoblastic segments each. As is well

* known, Newport held that each double segment represented two single segments of
an earlier stage in the phylogeny, which had become fused, and retained traces of
their original condition. Later on, Banrour suggested that the double segments
might represent single segments which had developed a second pair of limbs, and had
altered the nerve-system and other organs to suit them.
