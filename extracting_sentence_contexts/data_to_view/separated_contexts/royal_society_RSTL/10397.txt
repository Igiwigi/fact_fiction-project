to the produce in one or
Sther of the separation-years. With the less intensity of struggle without manure,
Ihere were, however, 12; and on plot 16, with more nitrogen and more mineral matter
Supplied, but the nitrogen applied as nitrate of soda, and with much more active
Yuxuriance than on plot 18 with the ammonia-salts, there were, nevertheless, 11. is is, no doubt, explained by the fact frequently before referred to, that the nitrogen
Sf ammonia-salts distributes much less rapidly and freely than that of nitrate of soda ;
And, therefore, even with less laxuriance, and consequently less active competition, the
growth of a more limited number is favoured. The percentage of grasses in the total produce, nevertheless, increased considerably
from one 8eparation-year to another. The increase was, however, almost exclusively
due to the increased proportion of the poor and comparatively surface-rooting Fesuca
ovina, Agrostis vulgaris, Holcus lanatus, and Anthozanthum odoratum ; which col-
lectively contributed in 1867, 32 ; in 1872, 60; and in 1877, 67 per cent.
