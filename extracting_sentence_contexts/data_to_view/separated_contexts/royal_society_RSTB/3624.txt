The evidence was
slight for the presence in the soil solutions, even in those from the dunged plot, of
other substances favourable to growth. In order to check the conclusions still further the set of experiments in this series
was duplicated with peas instead of barley (lower part of Table V). Peas do not form so sensitive a culture plant as barley because the growth is main-
tained for a long time on the food store in the seed itself, but when allowance is made
for this fact and the somewhat greater margin of error, the results obtained with
peas were in complete accord with those yielded by barley. The growth in the soil solutions being such as would be expected from the
composition of the solutions, and comparable with the growth of crops on the soils
themselves, it is interesting to compare the composition of these artificially made
solutions with that of the natural soil solution as far as it can be ascertained. The
drainage from the Rothamsted wheat plots is collected separately by a tile drain
running below each plot, and on various occasions when the drains ran during the
progress of these experiments samples were taken and analysed as below.
