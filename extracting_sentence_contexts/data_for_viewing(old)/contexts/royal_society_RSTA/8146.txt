* Tf the set is limited to distributions for which b = by, no sample point can lie outside the envelope of
hypercubes whose centres lie on the axis 7, = 4, = ... = 2.

regard to the whole set 2? As we have shown elsewhere* the method of likelihood
fixes for the critical region that part of the space that represents samples for which
the range (the difference between extreme variates) is less than a given value, say
1=1,. For samples of 2, 1= 2, — a, if 2, > a, and x, —a, if a <<, and the
critical region oq will therefore lie between two straight lines parallel to and equidistant
from the axis z, =. A pair of such lines will be the envelope of the small squares w,,
Wg, ete., of fig. 8a. In fact, the complete critical region will be as shown in fig. 8B, the
belt woo being chosen so that its area is eb,?.

For n = 3 the surface | = J, is a prism of hexagonal cross-section, whose generating
lines are parallel to the axis z, = 7, =2,. The space, Woo, Within this and the whole
space outside the cube W, will form the critical region w,. In general for samples
of n the critical region of the likelihood method will consist of the space outside the
hypercube Wo, and the space of content eb)" within the envelope of hypercubes having
centres on the axis 7, = %, =... = a, and edges parallel to the axes of co-ordinates.

It will have been noted that a correspondence exists between the hypotheses tested
