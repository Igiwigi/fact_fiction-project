there would still be a large number of hemiplastic substi- protein-coding sequences, which often include multiple
tutions (and a much smaller number of total sites available exons and long introns, can contain multiple different tree
for analysis). There is also again some variation in the topologies (figure 3). In fact, different exons in the same
number of incongruent sites among topologies, with between protein-coding gene may not share any more similarity in
8-14% and 22-24% incongruent sites for primates and their topologies than do exons in different genes (e.g. [43]). Drosophila, respectively (figure 5b,d). Because of this underlying heterogeneity, inferred gene

Among the tree topologies inferred from individual loci, trees may contain incongruent sites due to hemiplasy and
we do not expect the frequency of the two incongruent sites not homoplasy.
