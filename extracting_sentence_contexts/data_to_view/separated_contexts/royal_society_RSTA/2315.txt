To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, a dynamic anisotropy of transient wave patterns in
combination with resonant-like process was originally observed in [20], where the response of
structures modelling block rock massifs to the harmonic excitations was numerically studied.

There, an unexpected result was detected in the SCL: the action of the frequency of the point
harmonic force that is resonant for the MSL results in the development of growing oscillations
in certain selected directions, while the oscillations in other directions are practically locked into
the source vicinity. Despite the fact that an incorrect explanation was suggested for the obtained
results, the detected phenomenon attracted attention to the problem and strongly motivated its
further study. In [21], a comprehensive investigation was performed of the out-of-plane dynamics of the SCL
and of the uniform triangular-cell lattice. The new line-localized primitive waveforms (LPWs)
were discovered.
