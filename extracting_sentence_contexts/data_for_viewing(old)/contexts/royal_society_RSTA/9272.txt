namely, the sliding at the surface of separation, can be
removed by suitably increasing the tensions in the top beam and.the pressures in
the lower beam. The other dislocation, due to the different lateral curvatures, is less
easily disposed of. However, we can observe that when the beam is narrow this second
dislocation, is small, and we shall show, in fact, that it can be neglected in estimating
the flexural rigidity of a narrow beam. In the case of wider beams it will evidently
have a greater effect, and, moreover, its removal should increase the flexural rigidity
of the beam, since that removal is equivalent to adding an additional restraint to the
system. It will be shown later, however, that this increase in the flexural rigidity is
quite small, even in the extreme case when the beam becomes a plate. When the width
of the compound beam is great compared with the depth, it may be regarded as a
compound plate, and it will be seen that such a plate can be bent in just the same way
as a simple plate by couples applied to the four edges. Taking the case in which the
couples over the long edges reduce to zero (although the corresponding stresses will not
be identically zero), we have the case of a very wide compound beam bent by couples
at the ends only. For although the extraneous forces required to balance the tractions
over the lateral edges are not identically zero, they are statically in equilibrium. We
