This view is strengthened by the consideration that Rrynoups’ criterion? of
stability would lead us to expect that eddies would form in any stream of sea-water
flowing at a speed of 1 knot or more, when the depth is greater than some quantity
of the order of magnitude of 1 or 2 cm. Since the mean depth of the Irish Sea is
over 40 fathoms, mathematical considerations alone would lead us to suspect the
existence of the eddies, which can in fact be seen marking the surface of the sea in
places where the current runs exceptionally strongly, or over a particularly uneven
bottom. Several of these places are marked as “ripples” on the chart of the Irish
Sea, the sheet of water to which Mr. Srreer applied his calculations. Dissipation of Energy in Tidal Currents.
