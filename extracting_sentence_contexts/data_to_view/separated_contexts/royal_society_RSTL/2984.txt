The teeth, as I before remarked, are
perfectly white and intact ; nor did I observe that peculiar
cylindrical form of the incisores which has been assumed by
some naturalists, as one of the characters of the head in the
Ethiopian race. s
In order to complete the present essay on Egyptian mum-
mies, I must now trouble the Society with the farther details
of my observations on the age of the female under our con-
s1deration, and on the disease of which I conceive her to have
died, as deduced from the examination of the parts. When
we reflect for a moment, that the individual in question,
according to the more generally received opinion respecting
the antiquity of mummies found in the hypogei of Thebes,
had probably lived upwards of three thousand years ago,*
it will bespeak a very extraordinary power of preserva-
tion in the mode of embalming then practised, in some cases
at least, to be able to say, that the female of which we are
speaking, died at an age between fifty and fifty-five years ;
that she had borne children; and that the disease which
appears to have destroyed her was ovarian dropsy attended
with structural derangement of the uterine system generally.

Egyptian mummies. 299

That $uch are the facts, I appeal to the state of the bones of
the ilium, and of the uterus with its appendages, for proof,

The first exhibit that peculiar degree of thinning in the cen-
tre of their osseous plates which has been noticed in women
by Professor CHavssER and others, in the course of a great
number of observations, as an indication of their having borne
children, and of their having passed the fortieth year. This
thinning of the bones, in the particular part just mentioned,
has never been observed under forty years of age, and be-
comes gradually greater until fifty-five, when it has reached
its maximum, however longer the woman may continue to
live. In my mummy it will be seen, on looking at the pel-
vis, or at Plate XX. that the thinning of the iliac bones
Seems to have reached its maximum ; and as there are no
characters of decrepitude in the individual, it appears to
me, that from fifty to fifty-five was about the number of years
the individual had lived.
