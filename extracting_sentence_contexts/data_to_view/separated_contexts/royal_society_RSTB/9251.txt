Another factor that contributes to tumorigenesis is inflam-
mation which results from injury or infectious agents [42]. In this regard, it is notable that many of the more common can-
cers are associated with organs with more immediate exposure
to the external world, such as the lung, breast, prostate and gas-
trointestinal tract. In fact, the gastrointestinal tract, which has
its own immune defence hubs or Peyerâ€™s patches comprising
lymphoid cells, is teaming with the gut microbiota, which is
emerging as a key factor in health and disease, particularly
cancer [43]. The gut microbiota and its metabolism are docu-
mented to contribute to disease, such as the association of a
pro-atherogenic compound, trimethylamine-N-oxide, with
cardiovascular disease. It is probable that inflammatory metab-
olites from the microbiota stemming from short chain fatty
acids could well contribute to tumorigenesis.
