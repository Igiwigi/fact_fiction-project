117. The principal results to be deduced from experiments other than those which
are contained in this paper, are —

(1.) That the force and motion are proportional to the difference of temperature,
which results are geen to follow directly from equations (124) and (140).

(2.) That with a particular instrument the forces increase with the rarefaction up
to a certain point, after which they fall off; this result also follows directly from the
equation (140).

118. Equations (124) and (140) first revealed to me the fact that the pressure
of gas at which the force would become appreciable must vary inversely as the size of
the surface.

From equation (140) it appears that up to a certain point
