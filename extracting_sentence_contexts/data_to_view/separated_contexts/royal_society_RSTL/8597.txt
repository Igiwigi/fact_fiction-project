In Plate 6. figs. 36, 37, the furthest stage to which I have traced A. major is
given. The history 80 far furnishes interesting data for comparison with 4. minor
and with other Mollusca, though I haye fully stated the doubts and guesses connected
with the interpretation of much which is figured. In this, as in other cases, the figures
must at any rate serye as a basis of fact, interpret them how we may. In a 8ubject 80
yague and tentative as the embryology of the lower animal classes must for some time
remain, the best contribution which one can expect as yet to offer towards unrayelling
the complicated phenomena, is the obseryation and record of factâ€”a contribution which
can best be effected by few words and copious drawings. DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE MOLLUSCA. 21

The condition of the alimentary tract in the embryo of Aplysia major as we now
leave it is exceedingly interesting, and is never presented by the embryo of Aplysia
minor, nor by other Nudibranchs studied by me.
