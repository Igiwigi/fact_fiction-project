4-5 cms. sexually mature, must both be of approximately the same age, and since they
are of the same species from the same habitat, a habitat where the race of fish is approxi-
mately pure (p. 206), both groups of fish must be in the same developmental state.

That, however, the age or developmental state does in part condition sexual maturity
is obvious, and an idea of the exact developmental state in the case of the race of fish
from the source Ge, is given by the fact that none of these fish reach sexual maturity
below the length of 4-5 cms.


THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS. 259

In the case of the adult animal, the evidence points conclusively to the fact that the
annual onset of gametogenesis is conditioned by the temperature of the habitat
approaching its maximum, and it seems very probable from the above evidence that
this is also true of the assumption of sexual maturity.

In a habitat in which the high summer temperature is of relatively short duration,
and is followed by a rapid fall of temperature, only a small proportion of the fish
would be expected to reach sexual maturity by their first winter. These physical
conditions are fulfilled by the habitat Ga (see p. 223), and in this habitat the proportion
of large young fish was unusually high.

In the reproductive cycle of the adult there are four critical points (p. 201).
