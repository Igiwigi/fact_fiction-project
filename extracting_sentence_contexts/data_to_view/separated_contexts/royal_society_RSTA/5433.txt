The PDT might begin by

asking the right questions, pointing to forgotten moments and events, highlighting the opinions
expressed by the potential couple’s entourage, predicting health issues, prospects of financial
comfort—or not, identifying potential make or break disagreements, and in the end, after an

expertly guided exchange, propose to either go for it or temporize and suggest a probably more

suitable partner among the person’s other experiences and acquaintances. Then you decide!

3. Externalization of cognitive faculties

The option to let the PDT decide for you, is, in fact, the other, even more serious, challenge to
consider. Indeed, the more the PDT is developed with evermore data updating the twin’s ability
to provide counsel, the more the physical person will be tempted to trust the twin to make and
take decisions, thus displacing the centre of decision making from within to without the physical
body. This outcome of the fast-developing PDT industry is in keeping with a current phenomenon
that we call the reversal of cognitive features from inner to outer orientation.
