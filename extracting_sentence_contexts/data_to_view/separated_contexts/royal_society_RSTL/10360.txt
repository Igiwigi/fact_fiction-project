Taking the average of the four years of complete separation, there were 49 species
found in the samples from the unmanured plot, 33 only by ammonia-salts alone, 39
(over three separation-years only) with the larger quantity of nitrate, and 42 with
the smaller quantity. We have now with the mixed mineral manure alone an
average of 43, which is higher than on any plot with nitrogenous manure, whether
used alone or in conjunction with minerals. The fact is that, with nitrogenous
manure, there is more of forced luxuriance of individual species, varying, it is true,
