All the
figures for the blood volume are therefore too high by an unknown, though probably
not very large, proportion, owing to the inability of the carbon monoxide method to
discriminate between the heemoglobin within and outside the circulation—in the case
of normal rabbits Boycorr and Dovenas found that the hemoglobin left in the
muscles, bone marrow, &e., after washing out the blood-vessels as thoroughly as
possible, was about 7 per cent. of the total amount of hemoglobin in the body. Adding to this the fact that the blood volume is calculated in the HaLpang and
Lorrain Smrra method from the total and the percentage oxygen capacity, and that

* The value accepted by Htrner for the amount of oxygen which combines with one gramme of
hemoglobin is 1°34 c.e., but we prefer to give the equivalent of the hemoglobin in terms of its oxygen
capacity, as that is the value which was directly measured in our experiments.

+ A comparison of the carbon-monoxide method with WELCKER’s method on rabbits, as well as the
determination by the carbon-monoxide method of quantities of blood abstracted from, or transfused into,
rabbits will be found in Boycorr and Doveras, ‘Journ. of Path.
