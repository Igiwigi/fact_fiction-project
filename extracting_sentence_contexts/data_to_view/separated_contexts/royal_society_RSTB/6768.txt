This is best indicated by tabulating those features
in which they differ from both the Nuculidae and the Solenomyidae.

* Tredale (1939) separates the Solemyidae [=Solenomyidae] from the other Protobranchia and
places them in a separate order Palaeobranchia. He states, in explanation of this, that ‘The eden-
tulous hinge and weak shell contrast greatly with the multidentate hinge and stout shell of its
associates elsewhere, the Nuculids, the only resemblance being the simple gill seen in the animals of
both these groups. This, however, is of quite a different nature in each case, and is certainly not a

sign of any relationship whatever.” It is impossible, in the light of the work of Pelseneer (1891) and
of Stempell (1899) and of the facts presented in this paper, to admit the truth of this statement. Cc. M.
