On the migration
theory such facts receive a simple explanation, whilst on the excalation theory it is
difficult to see how they can be accounted for. :

Summary. The facts recorded in this paper may be conveniently summarised as follows :â€”

(1) The anterior collector passes through a stage in which more branches are
present than in subsequent development. As development proceeds, some of
these most rostral branches degenerate, so that the older embryos contain
less branches than the younger embryos, and adults again less than older
embryos. (2) A posterior collector is always formed in embryonic life, and is never found in
the adult forms.
