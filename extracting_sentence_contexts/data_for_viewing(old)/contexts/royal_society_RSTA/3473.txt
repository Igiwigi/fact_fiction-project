Figure 4. Evidence for shock powering of LBV giant eruptions, from Smith et al. [44]. (a) A comparison of the early (day 34)
and late-time (day 1836) spectra for UGC 2773-0, highlighting the excess blue emission. Both spectra are normalized to the red
continuum level, and in fact the red spectra appear very similar except for Ha and Ca‘ . In the blue, there is a clear excess of line
emission at late times. (b) Isolates this excess blue emission by subtracting the normalized day 34 spectrum from the normalized
day 1836 spectrum. The grey plot is the residual, and the black plot is a smoothed version of the residual emission. This residual
is compared to the ‘blue pseudo-continuum’ seen in SN 200Sip (red) on day 905 [45], which is characteristic of the forest of blue
emission lines seen in interacting SNe IIn. This indicates that the excess blue line emission in UGC 2773-0T is most likely powered
by a shock interacting with CSM. (Online version in colour.)

winds have a harder time accounting for the combination of very fast speeds while also having
most of the mass in a thin shell moving relatively slowly. Although we normally think of an
explosion as occurring on a dynamical time, Smith [43] showed that the decade-long plateau
of n Car’s Great Eruption could be explained by a shock wave ploughing through dense CSM,
as in the standard picture for SNe IIn. More recently, studies of the SN impostor UGC 2773-OT
showed clear signatures of shock excitation in its spectrum during its decade-long eruption that
