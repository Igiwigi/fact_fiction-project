vertically even in the case of oblique incidence.

In order to evaluate the attenuation suffered by a wave in the ionosphere, it is often
convenient to divide the ionosphere into a deviating region and a non-deviating region,
the latter being situated below the former. The non-deviating region is one in which
propagation can be considered rectilinear but in which absorption may not be negligible.
In this region there is no appreciable variation with height in the angle between the
direction of propagation of the wave and the direction of the earth’s magnetic field, and
consequently the main difficulty which the technique of the present paper was developed
to overcome is non-existent. The attenuation suffered by a magneto-ionic component
in the non-deviating region of the ionosphere may be calculated by integrating
the imaginary part of Appleton’s complex refractive index along the oblique rectilinear
path of the component in the non-deviating region, and this is true in spite of the fact
that the planes of constant amplitude do not coincide with the planes of constant
phase.

In the deviating region of the ionosphere the following method is available for
calculating the integrand of (25). Reflexion from the ionosphere is only appreciable
provided the effect of damping in the deviating region is sufficiently small (see p. 429).
In these circumstances Newton’s method of correcting approximate roots of equations
may be used to deduce the roots of the quartic equation (7) from the roots which are
obtained when damping is entirely neglected and which are represented by the curves
IA, RA, IB, RB in fig. 7. Let g now denote, not as in (23) a root of (7) for the case when
damping is taken into account, but a root of (7) for the case when damping is entirely
neglected. Let ¢ be the small complex correction to this root necessitated by the intro-
