developed by Burke & Taylor [40], which links the initial wave function with the final wave
function in the inner regions through the electric dipole.

In the case of photodissociation, let the initial wave function be Y%, an eigenstate of the
energy-independent inner region, i.e. yy; for some i; this will often be the ground or low-lying
