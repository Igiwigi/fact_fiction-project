9. Where to next?

The considerable challenge the UK faces is to resolve what we have now, that is, the multiplicity of
observations, which have essentially evolved over time, with a multiplicity of needs and interests.
Table 1 summarizes why broad categories of stakeholders need marine observations, which need
to be converted into ‘information’ to be of use and value. There is no doubt that each of the
stakeholder groups identified in table 1 would support the notion of a sustained UK marine
observation network. So what are the barriers to success? There is certainly no shortage of ideas
or technology to develop a sustained network. Marine observation technology is developing at an
extraordinary rate, with the advent of increasingly complex autonomous surface and subsurface
vehicles from which increasingly complex sensors are being deployed. The technology to deploy
cabled observatories is now also very well developed. Nor is there a lack of willingness to
deploy this new technology; in fact the rush to deploy all these ‘new toys’ makes the need for
a coordinated network all the more urgent.

However, one barrier is the potential for a lack of agreed priorities and responsibility among
the multiple stakeholders. Figure 6 [28] attempts to brigade the stakeholders into four broad
categories of user: policy, science, voluntary and industry. Each of these users has different
motivations and the sources of funding tend to be different. This is clearly a simplification of
reality and there is considerable overlap between the four user groups and their interests. For
