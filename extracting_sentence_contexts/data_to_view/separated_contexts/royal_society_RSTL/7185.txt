Powell of Madras, a most extraordinary change has taken place in this nebula
since my figure of it was delineated. He states that the southern end of the
curious oval yacuity close to the great star, which was decidedly closed when I
depicted it, is now decidedly open. Should this be established, it will be the
most extraordinary fact that has yet appeared in the history of a nebula.
