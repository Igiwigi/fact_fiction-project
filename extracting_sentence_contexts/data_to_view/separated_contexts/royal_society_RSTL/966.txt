In the apophyllite, however, the
agency of this secondary cause is placed in the fullest evi-
dence, The application of our general formula to the ano-
malous tints of that body, while it proves incontestably the
exact coincidence of the axes for all the coloured rays, points
out at the same time a peculiarity in its action on the more
refrangible extremity of the spectrum, of a nature $0. sin-

52 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the action of

natural and artificial bodies hitherto examined, as to render
me extremely desirous of prosecuting the research, with the
aid of more perfect specimens, and improved methods of
observation. Having arrived at the general result of a dispersion of the
axes by the s8ole consideration of the gradation of tints' in
plates of various thicknesses, it becomes interesting to verify
it by direct and independent observation. This I have ac-
cordingly done ; and the fortunate discovery of a substance
in which it is of enormous magnitude, puts it in our power to
render the fact sensible to the eye of the most unpractised
observer, by an exceedingly simple experiment, to be de-
8cribed in its place.

II. Of the general phenomena of crystals which develope tints
deviating from NEwToN's Scale, by exposure to polarised light. In describing the phenomena, I shall at present confine
myself to the tints developed along the principal section of
the crystal, which is supposed placed in an azimuth 45* with
the plane of primitive polarisation.
