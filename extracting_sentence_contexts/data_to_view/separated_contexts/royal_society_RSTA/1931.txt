The latter quantity is studied in more detail in figure 11
where it is compared against a large set of data based on experiments (Sugimoto ef al. compiled
by Hida [91] and Heberle et al. [92]), models [93] and numerical simulations [90]. Despite a slight
overestimation, the right tendency is obtained with the present method. This is very promising
considering the fact that a relatively coarse mesh and the very simple halfway bounce back rule
were used.

5. Implementation and efficiency

Common LB schemes are characterized by a separation between a local collision step, which
characterizes the physical properties of the model, and a generic, non-local streaming step. The collision step is usually carried out by manipulating the component of the populations that


deviates from equilibrium, through a linear term, as in the straightforward BGK model [49], or
a more general expression, as in multiple-relaxation-time approaches [4].
