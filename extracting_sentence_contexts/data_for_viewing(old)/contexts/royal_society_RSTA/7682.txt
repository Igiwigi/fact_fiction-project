accuracy hoped for is 1 part in 100,000, so that even if ) is known to not better
than 10% or 20°%, the final result will not be greatly affected.

4—ANALYSIS OF THE CIRCUIT

We have seen that departures from the ideal network due to eddy currents,
displacement currents, and stray inductance are to be dealt with by replacing the
simple inductances and resistances of the ideal circuit by impedance operators,
each referring to some portion of the actual network between specified points. The
zero adjuster already mentioned is essentially a device for adding an eddy-current
effect of controllable magnitude to mesh (2). Its presence will modify the impedance
operators of the three meshes, and, provided these impedance operators are measured
with the adjuster set in its proper position, the fact that it constitutes a fourth mesh
may be ignored in practice. This procedure is justified by the following analysis
of the network.

Fig. 3 represents the Campbell circuit including the zero-adjusting circuit,
indicated as mesh (4), and the various associated capacities.

Let &s, 23, £, be the impedance operators for circuits 2, 3, and 4.

Let »,. be the mutual impedance operator for circuits 1 and 2, and let all y’s
have similar meanings, except that ».,; does not include the part due to the com-
ponent S, which is called £.3, and 2,3 does not include the part due to the component
r, which is called £,;. Ignoring for the present all the capacitances to earth, we may
