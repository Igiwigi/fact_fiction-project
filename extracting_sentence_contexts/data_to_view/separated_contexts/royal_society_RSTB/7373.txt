Hence the results with histones from the ox must not be taken to disprove the existence
of cell specificity in this species; they must be regarded as negative. The histones from the
fowl present a much more favourable case. Those from the spleens and thymus glands,
assuming them to originate from the nuclei of identical cells, would be expected to be the
same, as in fact the analyses indicate, but do not prove, that they are. But the histone
from the erythrocytes is definitely different in compasition. Its arginine content is smaller
than that of the lymphocyte histone.
