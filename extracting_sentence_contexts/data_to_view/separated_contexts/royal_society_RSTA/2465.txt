We then expect that
type III radio bursts will always be injected at the strongly turbulent locations associated with the
fragmented current sheet. The type I radio burst will always be present when shocks are formed
ahead of the CME. The fact that we do not always detect them is mainly due to observational
limitations.

— Gradual events are generally considered to have a composition similar to that of the
corona or SW, while impulsive events typically have enhanced element and isotope ratios. We did not address this very important and crucial issue in this review, since the efficiency of
strong turbulence in the acceleration of particles with different elemental abundances and isotopes
has not been studied yet.

— The energy spectra based on the GLE show a double power-law, with the break between
2 and 50 MeV. This observation is not only related with the sources of SEP events.
