Serlii, none of the pinnules of fronds of
which type are constructed on the plan of figs. 13 & 14. I am therefore now inclined
to conclude that Rachiopteris aspera (as T propose provisionally to designate the petioles
just described) is a Sphenopteris. It is an important fact in reference to this question,
that we haye in the Coal-measures a Sphenopteris with a tuberculated rachis, and which
has a wide geographical range. This. is the S. Zoeninghaus! already referred to.
