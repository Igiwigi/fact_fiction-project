of high-level methods for primary thermometry. This is a fundamental change in temperature
metrology as any traceable thermometry will no longer require the sole usage of the international
temperature scales. The methods to be included in the MeP-K should be documented in detail
and provided with a complete uncertainty budget approved by the CCT. In addition, at least
two different implementations must exist and be compared with each other, as well with already
accepted methods. To advance this process and in preparation for the awaited redefinition of
the kelvin in terms of the Boltzmann constant, the project ‘Implementing the new kelvin—InK’
[4] was established within the Euramet Metrology Research Programme. The work we report on
here is part of the InK project.

In the low-temperature region, reliable thermometry is still a demanding task even though : =
a great variety of thermometers are available for temperature measurements. This is caused by : yy
the fact that most of the thermometers exhibit nonlinear characteristics, are prone to external 2
influences and instabilities and may lose thermal contact with the object being measured with aes
decreasing temperature. 22

In the history of international temperature scales, which started in 1887 when the first : 8
international temperature scale was adopted by the Comité International des Poids et Mesures DN
(CIPM), only four different truly low-temperature scales were adopted, namely the 1958 +He : g
and 1962 *He vapour-pressure scales [5,6], the 1976 Provisional 0.5K to 30K Temperature : &

Scale (EPT-76) [7] and the PLTS-2000 [2]. The ITS-90 is basically identical to the EPT-76 in the
temperature range between 0.65 K and 5 K as it is based on the same experimental dataset for the
helium vapour pressure but is represented in a different mathematical form.
