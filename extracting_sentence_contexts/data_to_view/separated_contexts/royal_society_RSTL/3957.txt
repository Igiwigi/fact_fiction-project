When these
remarkable phenomena are more fully studied, the aspect they present is that of a
disturbance continuing frequently through several successive days, changing from
one element to another, and affecting each at different hours and in different modes,
in conformity with laws, the average operation of which it has been the object of this
investigation to ascertain ; and wearing the appearance consequently, when only a
Single element is regarded, of a limitation to those hours when that element in par-
ticular is affected, but which appearance ceases when the phenomena are more
generally apprehended. It was the supposed analogy between magnetical and atmo-
spherical disturbances, which led, in the commencement of the British Colonial
Observatories, to the si'multaneous observations and record of these two great, and,
as we have now reason to believe, distinct branches of natural phenomena; and as
the inquiry advances, we are continually becoming acquainted with additional cir-
cumstances to strengthen the persuasion, that the causes of these occasional and
previously supposed © irregular” manifestations of disturbing magnetical influence
must be sought in a more distant source than in variations of the meteorological
phenomena. There is another misapprehension in regard to the nature of the occasional
disturbances which has followed very naturally from the limitation of the view to
the disturbances of a single element: an inference has sometimes been drawn in
favour of a local origin of a particular disturbance (in contradistinction to the general
fact of their simultaneous occurrence at extremely distant parts of the globe) from

the circumstance, that though the disturbance was manifested by the Declination at
one station, no indication of it was shown by the contemporaneous observations of
the Declination at another and a distant station. Now, simultaneity at stations sepa-
rated by considerable intervals of longitude implies a difference in the solar hours ;
and the obseryations at Toronto show that a difference in the solar hour may deter-
mine the question, whether a disturbance, which may nevertheless be common to
both stations, may or may not be traceable at both by simultaneous obseryations of a
single element only. Towards the attainment of a just conclusion, therefore, in
regard to a possible local origin, it is indispensable that a more extensive general-
ization should be made, and that contemporaneous affections of the three elements
ASbould be brought into the comparison.
