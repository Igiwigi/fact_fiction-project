Of the specimens tested, some appear to possess considerable merit as judged by the
standards of Farapay’s time and having in mind the purposes for which they were
intended.

In considering this matter we must disregard for the moment all that we know
concerning modern alloys, such as manganese steel, silicon steel, high-speed tool steels,
heat and corrosion resisting steels, and all the other remarkable alloy steels of to-day.
Farapay was concerned with obtaining alloys which would make better knives,
surgical and other cutting instruments than ordinary carbon steel and with discovering
alloy steels that would, amongst other articles, produce mirrors which would be com-
paratively free from liability to rusting or tarnishing.

Tn view of the statements made in his two papers that he did, in fact, discover some
steel alloys which were found to be of superior quality to those then made for cutting
instruments and edge tools, it seems quite possible that these could have been used

industrially or at least made the means of developing such steels after their further
improvement.

As regards corrosion, judging from the small specimens examined by the author in
this research, the results obtained did not differ materially from those of ordinary
steel; in fact, this could not be expected now we know the composition of Farapay’s
