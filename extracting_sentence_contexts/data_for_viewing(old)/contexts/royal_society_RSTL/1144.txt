charcoal indifferent proportions from those composing any
known compound of those elements ;—or- it may be merely
the vapour 'of a highly volatile oil, mingled in various pro-
portions with olefiant gas, carburetted hydrogen, and the
other combustible gases. Of these two opinions, Mr. DAL-
Tox is inclined to the first, considering it as supported by the
fact that oil gas, or coal gas, may be passed through water,
without being deprived of the ingredient in question ; and that
this anomalous elastic fluid is absorbed by agitation with water,
and again expelled by heat or other gases, unchanged as toits
chemical properties, as we have both satisfied ourselves by
repeated experiments. On the other hand, I have found that
hydrogen gas, by remaining several days in narrow tubes in
contact with fluid naphtha, acquires the property of being af-
fected by chlorine precisely as if it were mixed with a small
proportion of olefiant'gas; and Tam informed byDr. Hops, that
ol gas, when forcibly compressed in Gonpox's portable gas
lamp, deposits a portion of a highly volatile essential oil. The
