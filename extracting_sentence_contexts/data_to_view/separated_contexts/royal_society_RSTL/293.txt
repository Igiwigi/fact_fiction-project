This
I consider as a demonstration that the copper in the ore was
in the state of black oxide. Now, black oxide of copper is a .
compound of 100 metal + 25 oxygen. So that, the 48.6
grains of copper, extracted from the ore when in the state of
black oxide, must have weighed 60.75 grains.


« new Species of Copper Ore. 49

From the preceding analysis, it appears that the ore is. com-
posed as follows:
Carbonic acid, - -..,16,70

Peroxide of copper 60,7
Peroxide of jron - 19.50
Silica - - 2.10
Loss ” - 9.95

100.00

The silica was obviously accidental, and derived from the
quartz crystals; so that the ore, in fact, consists of carbonic
acid, peroxide of copper, and red oxide of iron. In the differ-
ent analyses, I have found the copper to vary a little, The
least quantity I obtained was 48.6, the greatest 51 grains. The red oxide of iron and siliceous matter varied also some-
what.
