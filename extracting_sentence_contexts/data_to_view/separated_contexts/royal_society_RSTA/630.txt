Einstein hoped and even believed that it will, while Bohr thought that it might not,
which is not the same as to say that it never will. In non-realist interpretations of quantum phenomena and quantum mechanics, only
predictions, moreover, in general, only of a probabilistic or statistical nature, concerning quantum
phenomena, even those associated with primitive individual quantum processes, are possible. This is one of the reasons (but not the only reason) for such interpretations, because this character
of quantum predictions is an experimental fact. As noted from the outset, the repetition of
identically prepared experiments, in general, leads to different outcomes. Unlike in classical
physics, this difference cannot be improved beyond a certain limit (defined by Planckâ€™s constant,
h) by improving the conditions of measurement, a fact also reflected in the uncertainty relations,
which are equivalent or correlative to the statistical nature of quantum predictions.
