The default frequency set-up is 30-78 MHz for the LBA and
120-168 MHz for the HBA. The LOFAR EoR project [26,27] uses a slightly different frequency
range to access higher redshifts, but has to deal with the increasing radio-frequency interference
(RFI) at the top of the HBA band (the RFI rapidly increases above approx. 168 MHz). The LBA is
clearly more interesting for studying the Dark Ages, and in fact Gehlot et al. [28] have placed the
first limits on the power spectrum for z = 19.8-25.2. They use only the Dutch array, which limits
ky to <0.16Mpce~!, and places a 20 limit of A3, < (approx. 1500 mK)? at k= 0.038 Mpcâ„¢! from
two simultaneously observed fields. They centre their bandwidth on the most sensitive portion
of the LBA band, setting frequency limits of 39-72 MHz.
