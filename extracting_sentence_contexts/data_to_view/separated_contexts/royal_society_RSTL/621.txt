Hence it appears, that the velocity with which heat is given
off from the naked surface of a heated metal exposed to: cool in
the air, is to the velocity with which it is given off by the same
metal when its surface is blackened in the manner above de-
scribed, as g64 to 693, or as 634 to 10000, very nearly; for
the velocities are as the times of cooling, inversely. Again, in the experiment No. 6, the sides of the instrument
No. 2 being covered with four coatings of spirit varnish, the
instrument was found to cool through the given interval of 10
degrees in go+ minutes,

In that time, a quantity of heat == 1627 parts, must have
made its way through the covered ends of the instrument; .and
the remainder, = 837g parts, must have made its way through
its varnished sides. This quantity, = 837g parts, would have required 664 minutes,
to have made its way through the naked sides of the instrument;
and, as it actually made its way through the varnished sides of

the instrument in goZ minutes, it appears that the velocity with
which the heat was given off from the naked metallic surface,
was to the velocity with which it was given off from the same
surface covered with four coatings of spirit varnish, as 664 to
oZ, or as 10000 to 4566,

Without pursuing these computations any farther, at present,
and without stopping to make any remarks on the curious facts
they present to us, I shall hasten to experiments from the results
of which we shall obtain more satisfactory information. But,
before I proceed any farther, I must give an account of an in-
strument I contrived for measuring, or rather for discovering,
those very small changes of temperature in bodies, which are oc-
casioned by the radiations of other neighbouring bodies, which
happen to be at a higher, or at a lower temperature. This instrument, which I shall take the liberty to call a ther-
moscope, is very simple in its construction.
