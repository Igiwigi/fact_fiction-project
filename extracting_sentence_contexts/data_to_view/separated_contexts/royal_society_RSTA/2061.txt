Comparison between theories with internal variables and EIT, for some concrete
systems, is very illustrative and stimulating. For instance, in the approach of [38] to heat transport,
a vectorial and a tensorial quantity are considered as internal variables; in the case that these
variables are identified with the heat flux and the flux of the heat flux, the resulting equations
for the heat equation, the entropy and the entropy flux become very close to those of extended
irreversible thermodynamics. The fact that the generalized entropy flux has been introduced in a
very different form than in such theory makes the coincidence of the results of both approaches
especially reassuring, as they are supporting each other. Despite their restricted character, the answers provided by extended thermodynamics to the
previously mentioned conceptual questions may be a useful guide to more general situations,
and they are helpful to give to the mentioned answers some more precise and concrete forms. For instance, the reduction of the extended entropy with respect to the local-equilibrium entropy
may be physically interpreted in two different but complementary and mutually consistent ways.
