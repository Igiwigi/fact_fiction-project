The perceived magnitude of an object, therefore, diminishes as the inclination of
the axes becomes greater, while the distance remains the same; and it increases,
when the inclination of the axes remains the same, while the distance diminishes.
When both these conditions vary inversely, as they do in ordinary vision when the
distance of an object changes, the perceived magnitude remains the same*,

Before I proceed further it will be proper to explain the meaning of some of the
terms I employ. I call the magnitude of the object itself, the real or objective mag-

* Several cases of the alteration of the perceived magnitude of objects are mentioned by Dr. R. Sura
(Complete System of Opticks, 1738, vol. ii. P- 388, and rem. 526 and 532) ; and Dr, R. Danwin (Philosophical
Tranzactions, vol. Ixxvi. P- 313) observed that when an ocular spectrum was impressed on both eyes it appeared
magnified when they were directed to a wall at a considerable distance. The facts noticed by these authors
are satisfactorily explained by the above considerations.

nitude; the magnitude of the picture on the retina, the retinal magnitude; and the
magnitude we estimate the object to be from its retinal magnitude and the inclina-
tion of the optic axes conjointly, I name the perceived magnitude. I do not use the
term apparent magnitude, bhecause, according to its ordinary acceptation, it s0metimes
means what I call retinal, and at other times what I name perceived magnitude.
