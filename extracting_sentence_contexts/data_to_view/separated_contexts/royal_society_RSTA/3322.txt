The ketonization of carboxylic acids on anatase and rutile TiO2 and monoclinic and tetragonal : =
ZrO2 has been considered recently in a very detailed and extended theoretical-experimental : &

study by Wang and Iglesia [10]. The main conclusion of this work is that ketonization turnover
rates are much higher on m-ZrOp, t-ZrO7 and a-TiO2 than on r-TiO); the reason lies in the
particular cationâ€”cation distances that stabilize the bidentate bonding mode of acetate compared
to the monodentate species. At very high coverages, in fact, the less stable monodentate acetate
ion becomes the key reactive intermediate, while the more stable bidentate molecules only act
as spectators [10]. In this work, it was also shown that pre-treatment in Hp of a-TiO? at 543K
did not result in changes in ketonization rates, indicating that either reduced centres do not form
during the treatment or that they do not play a role in the reaction. This is different from what was
reported by Pham et al., who showed that the ketonization activity increases with a reductive pre-
treatment of a Ru/TiO2 catalyst, and it drops when the reduced catalyst is exposed to O2 before
the reaction [8,15].
