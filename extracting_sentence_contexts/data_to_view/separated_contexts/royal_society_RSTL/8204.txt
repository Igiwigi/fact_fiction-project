T have, however, never, until lately, succeeded in obtaining any evidence of its presence
in the calcium spectrum ; but there is evidence to show that the metal I employed was
very pure. We have here, then, two metals with two lines common to their spectra ; and it is found
that the line which was long and bright in one spectrum, is faint in the other; and with
regard to a third line, one observer finds it in both spectra, the other in one only, and
after many attempts succeeds in observing it in the second, but only in @ s8pecimen known
to be contaminated with the first. The simplest explanation of the case, bearing in mind the facts already established in
my first paper, is that the calcium used to produce the spectrum was contaminated to a
certain extent with strontium, the strontium in turn containing calcium, a state of things
which a moment's consideration will show to be not only possible but most probable, the
close chemical relation of the two metals, and the extreme difficulty of making even an
approximate separation when mixed, being well known. Even if we knew nothing of the probability of mixture occurring in the cases of the
two metals in question, the behaviour of the line at w. 1. 42153 is sufficient to show
what is the true cause of the coincidences. ; The longest lines of calcium at wave-lengths 4226, 3968, and 3933 occur also in iron,
cobalt, nickel, barium, &c., and assume very considerable proportions, equalling or sur-
passing in length many undoubted lines of those elements; on the other hand, the iron
lines at wave-lengths 4071, 4063, and 4045 occur in calcium, strontium, and barium,
and in other metals.
