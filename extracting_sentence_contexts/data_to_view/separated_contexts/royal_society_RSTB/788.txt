It can only be said, in a general way, that both are
somewhat intermediate between the lower pliocene H. stvalensis and the existing
H. amphibius, a remark which likewise applies to H. Lemerlei; but otherwise the
® skull in the British Museum differs from the one described by GuLDBERG in various
respects, some of the variations being such that it is impossible to account for them
as being due to age or sex. The London skull appears to be equally different from
