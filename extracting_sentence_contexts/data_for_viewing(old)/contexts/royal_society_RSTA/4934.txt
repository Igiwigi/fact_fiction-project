(2) For A=2, we have

1
Mo 9(F,) =2 — 7

(3) Forn > A> 3, we have

Ma,A(Fq) =A! —

A(A — 1A! 1
qo (3)

Proof. Assertion (1) is immediate from the fact that #V(1, 1, 7)(F,) =q. Assertion (2) is immediate
from the fact that #V(2,2,n)(Fq) =2q(q —1)+q= 2q7 —4q.
For n > A > 3, we break up V(A,A,1)(F,) by the number d of distinct coordinates x, in a point.
The number of points with precisely d distinct xq’s is the product of mat (q — i) with a strictly
positive combinatorially defined integer, call it D(A, A,n,d).


We have D(A,A,1,A) =A! and D(A,A,n,A — 1) =(4)” x (A —2)! [The term (4)” is to specify
on each side the placement of the double root, and the term (A — 2)! is to specify the reordering of
the A — 2 simple roots.

So looking at the two highest order terms, we have
