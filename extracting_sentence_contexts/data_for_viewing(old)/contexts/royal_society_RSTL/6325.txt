notwithstanding this marked difference in their habitats, all the specimens of Carpenteria
yet examined have their cavities occupied by the same spongy substance :—3rd. 'That a
firm brownish yellow substance of far greater consistence than the sarcode of Forami-
nifera, is found to occupy even the smallest and earliest chambers of Carpenteria
(figs. 2, 4, a), filling them s0 completely that it can scarcely be supposed to be anything
but the animal body properly belonging to them ; and that although the substance in
question is there destitute of spicules (the chambers being too s8mall to accommodate
them, as will be seen by the comparison of figs. 4 and 16, allowing for the difference
of magnifying power), yet it is obviously the same with that in which spicules are
copiously imbedded in the larger and later chambers:—and 4th. That notwithstanding
the multitudes of sections of various Foraminiferous shells which I have made during
the last ten or twelve years, I have never found their chambers to be occupied by
a parasitic sponge of any description. I may add to these considerations the fact men-
tioned to me by Mr. DEx1s MAcpoxALD, that he has met with various forms of branching
Sponges®, possessing a peculiarly solid calcareous skeleton, and in many respects

appearing to present the same kind of transition from Sponges towards Foraminifera,
that, if my view be correct, is afforded by Carpenteria from Foraminifera towards
Sponges.
