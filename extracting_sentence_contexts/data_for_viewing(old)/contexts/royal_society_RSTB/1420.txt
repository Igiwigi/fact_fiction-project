abortive sporangia in which either the whole, or the outer portion only, oft)
spotogenous tissue has remained sterile. This view is supported by the rek
small size of those sporangia which appear to be completely filled with parene
tissue.

D. The Spores.

It has long been known that the spores of Calamostachys ave often found a
together in tetrads, each tetrad being enclosed within a common membrane, %
doubtless the wall of the mother-cell. Cases of this kind have been figured in pre:
memoirs,{ and have also been observed and figured by M. Renauwr in
fructifications.ยง The latter author lays great stress on the arrangement of
in tetrads, regarding this fact as an argument for the bodies in question being |
nature of pollen-grains, rather than spores. || ;

In Calamostachys Binneyana, at any rate, there is no ground for such a view, fi
spores certainly did not remain associated in tetrads when mature. Isolat
are just as common as tetrads, and sometimes occur together with them i
same sporangium (see Plate 81, fig. 33), while in other cases the whole spe
is occupied by isolated spores. The separation of the sister-spores from one arth
must have taken place relatively late, but it certainly happened before mati

We have paid special attention to the spore-tetrads, which are shown on
scales, in Plate 81, fig. 33, and Plate 82, fig. 34. In some cases the group 0
spores is perfectly normal, all four being of approximately equal size (fig
