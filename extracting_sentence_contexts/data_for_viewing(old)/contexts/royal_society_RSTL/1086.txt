the Decomposition of the Earths, &c, ' 343

In the best result that I obtained from the distillation of
the amalgam of barytes, the residuum appeared as a white
metal of the colour of silver. It was fixed at all common
temperatures, but became fluid at a heat below redness, and
did not rise in vapour when heated to redness, in a tube of
plate glass, but acted violently upon the glass, producing a
black mass, which seemed to contain barytes, and a fixed
alkaline basis, in the first degree of oxygenation.*

* From this fact, compared with other facts that have been stated, p. 336, it may
be conjectured, that the basis of Harytes has a higher affinity' for oxygene than
sodium ; and hence, probably the bases of the earths will be more powerful instru-
ments for detecting oxygene, than the bases of the alkalies,

I have tried a number of experiments on the action of potassium on bodies
suppased simple, and on the undecompounded acids. From the affinity of the
metal for oxygene, and of the acid for the substance formed, I had entertained the
greatest hopes of 5uccess. It would be inconsistent with the object of this paper-to
enter into a full detail of the methods of operation ; I hope to be able to state them
fully to the Society at a future time, when they shall be elucidated by further
rTesearches ; I shall now merely mention the general results, to shew that I have not
been tardy in employing the means which were in my power, towards effecting'these
