If the semigroup (T(f));>0 is stable but not exponentially stable, then
one can never expect such an estimate to hold for every initial value x € X. Indeed, having (3.5)
for every x € X is equivalent to exponential stability by a simple application of the uniform
boundedness principle, as has already been observed. In fact, for strongly stable semigroups
which are not exponentially stable we obtain the following statement; see [3,80]. Theorem 3.3.

(a) Let (T(t))t>0 be a strongly stable but not exponentially stable Co-semigroup on a Banach space X. Then for every positive r € Co(R4) there exists x € X such that ||T(t)x\| = r(t) for all t = 0.

(b) Let (T(t))t>0 be a weakly stable but not exponentially stable Co-semigroup on a Hilbert space X.
