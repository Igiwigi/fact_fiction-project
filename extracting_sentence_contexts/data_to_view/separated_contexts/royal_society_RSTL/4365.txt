THE VITAL AND PHYSICAL FORCES. 741

elsewhere,—so may nerve-force, which has its origin in cell-formation, excite or modify
the process of cell-formation in other parts, and thus influence all the vital manifesta-
tions of the several tissues, whatever «may be their own individual characters. And
this expression will also be found available for the well-known influence of mental
conditions upon the properties of the various tissues and secretions, since this influ-
ence can only be exerted through the medium of nervous agency. Further, it not
only appears that a simple withdrawal or disturbance of the nervous force supplied
to particular organs occasions a retardation or perversion of their vital operations ;
but there also seems evidence that an influence of an opposite kind may be transmit-
ted through the neryous system, which is positively and directly antagonistic to the
vital powers of the several tissues and organs ;—such, at least, appears to be the only
mode of accounting for the extraordinary effect of a shock, mechanical or mental, in
at once and completely destroying the contractility of the heart, and in immediately
bringing to a stand the vital operations of other parts; and it harmonizes well with
the fact that, in hemiplegia, the © palsy-stroke” rransmitted from the brain along the
spinal cord almost invariably affects the leg less injuriously than the arm, and for a
$horter duration, recovery first taking place in the leg, even when it has been at first
paralysed as completely as the arm. If the neryous force be regarded as a polar
force (as snggested by Messrs. Topp and Bowman, © Physiological Anatomy,” vol. i.
