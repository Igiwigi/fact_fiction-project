the excitability of the heart is great, and its decline rapid, at high temperature, while
excitability is small, and decline slow, at low temperature.

SIV. The latent period of stimulation.

Our observations show that there is a general correspondence between the duration
of contraction of the ventricle, and its excitability, and the length of the latent period
of stimulation.

In general, the correspondence is such that, with the lengthening of the contraction,

-excitability decreases, and vice versd. That these effects are in the main dependent
on temperature is shown by the fact that they can be altered at will by variations of
the temperature of the surrounding medium. Thus we may alternately obtain with
the same heart, Ist, long contraction, long latent period, and obtuse excitability, or
2nd, short contraction, short latent period, and acute excitability, at (1st) lowered or
(2nd) heightened temperature respectively.

A heart removed from the body, and examined at 15° to 18° C., shows the
gradually increasing changes characteristic of lowered temperature; independently
of this factor, however, quite similar changes supervene which are to be referred to
the natural decline of action from the life normal to the death zero. This decline is,
as for other tissues, not instantaneous, but gradual, and characterised by gradually
increasing sluggishness, first, of spontaneous action, and secondly, of responsive action.
The complete elimination of the temperature factor did not enter into the plan of our
