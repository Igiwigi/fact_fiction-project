acid is capable of two, and only two isomeric modifications, viz.,

Both these acids have now been synthetically produced, and the first must be identical
with butyric acid, since they both contain ethylated methyl as their basylous radical—a
conclusion which is in perfect harmony with experimented facts, for we have shown above
that butyric acid and ethacetic acid are undistinguishable from each other, whilst meth-
acetic acid differs in odour and in the crystalline form of its silver-salt. Ascending now to caproic acid, the number of possible isomers is augmented to eight,
this being in fact the number of possible metameric modifications of the basylous radical
of caproic acid—amyl, viz. —
