folds of the true skin beneath it, as in the original segments (14. 7.), but passed di-
rectly oyer them, and was simply protruded or extended by the growth of parts be-
neath, as in the instance of the new legs (b,c). Up to this period the young Inlus
must still be regarded as in the embryo condition, although for a day or two after
bursting the amnion, it possessed the power of locomotion, and evinced some deve-
lopment of its peculiar instinct. At its next change of skin, when it enters what I
regard as the fourth period of its development, and when it has acquired fourteen
pairs of legs, it as8umes for the first time a condition analogous to the larya state of
true insects on bursting from the oyum ; the difference between the two being, that
the analogue of this tegument of the embryo in insects is slipped off at the bursting
of the amnion on leaving the shell, while that of the Myriapod is not thrown off until
some days after it has entirely left the ovum. The correctness of this analogy is con-
firmed by the fact, that the double legs, which may be regarded as the analogues of
the abdominal legs of the Caterpillar, are not acquired until a late period in the devye-
lopment of the embryo in insects, as I have seen in the embryo of the Caterpillar of
one of the Saw-flies, Athalia centifolic, in which the first legs developed are the tho-
racic, and at a little later period, while the larva is yet in the egg, the abdominal
ones. The permanent state of Tulus is thus strictly analogous to the transitory con-
dition of the insect in the larya state, the relative development of the two being very
similar, The ITulidz and other Myriapoda are thus connected, on the one hand, with
insects in the larya state ; and, on the other, still more closely with the Annelides by
the reproduction of segments of the body ; the repetition of the segments in Tulus
and other Myriapoda being one of the last occurrences in the higher forms of Arti-
culata, in which distinct segments, or principal, and vital portions of the body are
formed after leaving the ovum. This phenomenon almost entirely ceases in the higher
