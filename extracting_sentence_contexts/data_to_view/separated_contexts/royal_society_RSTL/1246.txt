They have also observed that a small elevated ridge (bour-
velet ) is formed round the lower lip of the wound in the
bark, which makes some slight advances to meet the bark
and wood projected, in much large quantity, from the oppo-
site, or upper lip of the wound. I have endeavoured, in a former Memoir,* to explain the
cause why some portion of growth takes place below inci-
sions through the bark, by supposing that a small part of the
true sap, descending from the leaves, escapes. downwards
through the porous substance of the alburnum. Several facts
stated by HaLes seem favourable to this supposition ; and the
existence of a power in the alburnum to carry. the ap in
different directions, is proved in the growth of inverted cut-
tings. of different species of trees,f But I have derived s0

many advantages, both as a gardener and farmer, ( particu-
cularly in the management of fruit and forest trees,) from
the experiments which have been the subject of my former
memoirs, that I am confident much public benefit might be
derived from an intimate acquaintance with the use and office
of the various organs of plants ; and thence feel anxious to
adduce facts to prove that the conclusions I have drawn are
not inconsistent with the facts stated by my great predecessors. It has been acknowledged, I believe, by every naturalist
who has written on the subject, (and the fact is indeed too
obvious to be controverted, ) that the matter which enters into
the composition of the radicles of germinating seeds existed
previously in their cotyledons ; and as the radicles increase
only in length by parts successively added to their apices, or
points most distant from their cotyledons, it follows of ne-
cessity that the first motion of the true sap, at this period, is
downwards.
