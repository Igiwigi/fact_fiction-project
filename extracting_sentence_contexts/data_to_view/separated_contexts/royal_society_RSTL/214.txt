When
phosphoric acid has remained long enough upon the pulverized
ore to dissolve all it can, the oxygen is concentrated, as it were,
to the amount of 20 per cent. in the part which is dissolved;
and all that which could not be dissolved has (through the two-
fold affinity of copper for oxygen, to the amount of 20 per cent,
and of phosphoric acid for that oxide of copper, at that degree
of oxidation,) yielded up its entire share of oxygen, to favour
the combinations which take place in a new order, the only one
which can exist among the substances now present. It is, there-
fore, to the disposing affinity, * caused by the presence of the
phosphoric acid, which seeks to combine with black oxide of
copper, that the reduction of 42 per cent. of this ore is entirely

* As the term predisposing affinity has been objected to, I have used the term dis-
posing, which I trust will not bethought improper. When in two bodies which, while
together, remain in their original tate, the equilibrium of their principles comes to
be broken by the presence of a third, we cannot but allow, that it is this third which

has disposcd them to the rupture of that equilibrium; and, most certainly, be the fact
explained as it may, whatever disposes may be called disposing.

to be attributed. All the acids above mentioned are capable of
producing the same change, but in a manner, perhaps, not quite
80 distinct or satisfactory. From the foregoing experiments it appears, that copper ex-
ists in this ore in a state hitherto unknown in nature ; and that
it contains much less oxygen than has ever been suspected in any
oxide of copper; for, from the quantity which was precipitated
in the metallic state by iron, it appears to be combined in the
proportion of about 11,5 per cent.
