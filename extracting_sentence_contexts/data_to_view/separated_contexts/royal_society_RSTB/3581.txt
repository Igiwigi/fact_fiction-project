The small cells are more favourable for the study of the connections of the
neurofibrille of the axone with the intracellular network, and this for two reasons:
firstly, because in these cells the network is usually rather less complex than in large
cells; and, secondly, because a central section through the axone, including its
fibrillze, also contains a greater proportion of the intracellular network than is the
case in a section of the same thickness through a large cell, and therefore the
connections of the axone fibrille with this network are more likely to be visible. These connections are clearly seen in figs. 22, 23, which are drawn from a small
anterior giant cell; in fact, from the first, or most anterior, giant cell of the specimen. In some of the giant cells, especially in the larger ones, the axone fibrillee arise from
a series of very fine fibrils which issue from the general network. The extreme
tenuity of these fibrils greatly increases the difficulty of establishing the connection
between the intracellular network and the axone fibrille.
