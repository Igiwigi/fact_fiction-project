Parameters determined from data on low molecular weights,
say of order 10? gmol~!, will not as successfully describe behaviour of melts
1aving molecular weights two or three orders of magnitude greater. Thus, the
characteristic parameters for the PS samples associated with figure 4 are different
irom those used in predicting the results of figure 3. The fact that a single set of
parameters (within the oligomeric regime) is able to capture the UCST shift for
