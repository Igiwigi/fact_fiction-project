corrections under the condition of our experiments have to be diminished by 0:00046 ;

hence, if ¢ is any interval of temperature on the standard thermometer, and tg that on
the Baudin thermometer, we find finally
t = ty (1 — 00135). We have made a few observations which check the correction (‘00046) we have
made to eliminate the error due to the fact that, in the actual equivalent experiment,
the zero of our Baudin had not reached its final state. The Baudin was placed in
water at a temperature 10° above that at which it had previously been kept, and was

= compared after the lapse of about ten minutes with the standard. The latter instru-
& ment had been immersed in the warm water for several hours, and its zero was
8 determined at the conclusion of the comparison.
