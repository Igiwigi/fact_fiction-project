Oviduct, nidamentary gland and uterus

In most elasmobranchs, as far as is recorded, the ostium abdominale of the oviducts lies
ventral to the oesophagus immediately posterior to the septum transversum and at some
distance from the ovary, the discharged ova being swept into it by ciliary action. Though
both oviducts usually share a single ostium they are not fused together except on the dorsal
sides of their proximal ends. In Cetorhinus, however, the proximal parts of the oviducts are
fused together to form a single tube which is shallowly embedded in the ventral surface of
the liver so that the ostium is carried in a caudal direction to lie in very close apposition
with the pocket on the right side of the ovary into which the internal ovarian cavity opens.
In correlation with the great size of all the organs in this fish the falciform part of the
suspensory ligament of the liver is strongly developed, and the unpaired part of the oviducts
lies in close relationship with this ligament, occupying in fact a position corresponding to
the ciliated bridge connecting the two liver lobes and along which, according to Metten
(1939), the ova pass from the anterior end of the ovary to the ostium in Sciliorhinus. The
ostium is closely applied to the ovarian pocket so that the ova can pass directly from the
one to the other without the necessity of being swept by cilia through any part of the
peritoneal cavity. A somewhat similar apposition of the ostium abdominale to the ovary
has been described by Widakowitch (1908) in Torpedo ocellata. The fact that the diameter
of the infundibular part of the oviduct is smaller than the ripe ova has already been
