ON THE NERVOUS AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS

capable of all the functions of the neryous influence. When it is found that
such a power exists, all doubt must necessarily cease. I have, as far as I know, in the preceding paper laid before the Society, or 1
referred to, all the circumstances which ought to influence our judgement re-
specting the relation which subsists between the neryous and muscular systems
of the more perfect animals, and the nature of the influence by which it is main-
tained ; and shall conclude by shortly recapitulating the more important re- n
sults,

It appears from all the facts which have been stated or referred to,â€”

That the power of the muscles both of yoluntary and involuntary motion is
independent of the neryous system; but that both are subjected to its influence, h
this influence being the constant stimulant in the functions of the former, but
only an occasional- stimulant in those of the latter, which in their ordinary
functions are excited by stimulants peculiar to themselves. That to the muscles of yoluntary motion it is 8upplied from those parts of
the brain and spinal marrow, from which the nerye of the particular muscle
takes its rise; to each of the muscles of young; motion, from eyery part
both of the brain and spinal marrow. That these organs are the only active parts of the nervous system, and that
the cerebral and spinal nerves on the one hand, and the ganglionic nerves
with their ganglions and plexuses on the other, are only the channels through
which their influence is conyeyed, the power of both systems of nerves-being
at all times proportioned to the excitement of the brain and spinal marrow,
and s00n ceasing, and not to be renewed when their influence is withdrawn,
and being uninfluenced by causes acting independently of these organs on
either et of the neryes themselvyes or on the ganglions and plexuses.
