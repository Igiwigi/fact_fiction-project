ForBxs of Chichester, with
the recently published views of Dr. BzrTHoD, of Gottingen, who has made a series
of observations on the temperature of cold-blooded animals*, and among them several
on insects, 80mewhat similar to those which I now have the honour of submitting to
the Society. But excellent as are the views of that gentleman, he does not appear
to have paid sufficient attention to the conditions of activity or rest in the insects at
the time of making his experiments, and consequently has omitted to observe the
important fact of the existence of a distinct temperature of body in individual in-
sects-f, and also those circumstances which augment or lessen its amount, and has
estimated the temperature by placing many individuals together, which, as will pre-
sently be seen, is open to several objections. Dr. BzrraoLD has, however, anticipated
me in the expression of one opinion, unto which we have mutually been led by our ob-
servations, viz. that at all events the higher classes of invertebrated animals ought not
to be considered as cold-blooded, since it is found that under certain conditions they
have a temperature of body higher than that of the surrounding medium.
