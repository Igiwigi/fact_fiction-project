Through its ability to constantly integrate
new genetic material, CRISPR-Cas provides bacteria with adaptive immunity,
which is heritable by offspring thanks to its integration into the host genome
[11,12]. Additionally to acquisition of new spacers, spacers can also be lost. In fact, the distribution of diversity and abundance of individual spacers in
virally challenged bacterial populations is highly variable [13-17]. Acquired
spacers in type I and II systems, which are the focus of this paper, are not uni-
