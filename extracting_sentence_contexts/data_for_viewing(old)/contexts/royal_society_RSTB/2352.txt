with each other by means of fine protoplasmic threads, which traverse minute per-
forations in the cell-wall. The researches of Waurer GARDINER and others have
shown that the isolated instances of this kind which were known in the sieve-tubes and
certain endosperm cells, are typical of plant tissue generally, and he regards these
channels of communication as playing an important part not only in the conduction
of impulses, but also in the conduction of nutritive substances from cell to cell.

The description and illustrations which GARDINER gives (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 62,
p- 100) of the minute perforations which exist in the closing membranes of the pits
and walls of vegetable cells, certainly suggest that such structures are eminently
fitted for producing all the diffusive phenomena which we have found to belong to
multi-perforate septa, and it is impossible to read the descriptions without being
struck with the fact that such an arrangement is admirably adapted to bring about a
local concentration of gradient and an enhanced flow through the separating cell-
membrane, when there is the slightest difference of osmotic pressure between two
contiguous cells,

Prerrer, in his ‘ Physiology of Plants’ (Engl. edition, 1900, p. 114), when dis-
cussing the probable réle of these fine plasmatic connections, while not actually
denying that they may play an accessory part in translocation, states “ there are,
however, no observations in favour of the view that such transference is of importance
in the translocation of nutritive or excretory substances from one cell to another.
