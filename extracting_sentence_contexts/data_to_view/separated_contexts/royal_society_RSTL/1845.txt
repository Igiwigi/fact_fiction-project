When the galvanometer connexion with the axis was broken, and its
wires made fast to two conductors, both applied to the edge of the copper disc,
then currents of electricity were produced, presenting more complicated ap-
pearances, but in perfect harmony with the above results. Thus, if applied as
in fig. 11, a current of electricity through the galyanometer was produced; but
if their place was a little shifted, as in fig. 12, a current in the contrary direction
resulted; the fact being, that in the first instance the galvanometer indicated
the difference between a strong current through A and a weak one through B,
and in the second, of a weak current through A and a strong one through B
(92.), and therefore produced opposite deflections. 96. So also when the two conductors were equidistant from the magnetic
poles, as in fig.
