suggestive and carefully scripted manner sometimes arguably
bordering on active deception or ‘lying by omission’. These alle-

have concluded that ‘inquisitorial’ systems of criminal pro-
cedure, which predominate outside Anglophone jurisdictions,
are culturally and ideologically more committed to truth-seek-
ing than adjudication organized on adversarial lines [59]. The
general worry is compounded in relation to expert evidence,
because science is expected to be the paradigm of objectivity
and factual rectitude and there are enhanced risks, relative to
lay witnesses of fact, that experts themselves might collude

At this tipping-point in the discussion, we are in danger

For example, in England and Wales (and across most of the
