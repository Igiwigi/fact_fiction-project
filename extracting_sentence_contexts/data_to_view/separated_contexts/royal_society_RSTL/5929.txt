Not that 1 reject
other methods; for I find sections of the medulla, simply hardened in chromic acid, of
great service, and use them largely, particularly for drawing figures under low powers,
wand sometimes for examination under higher powers, when I have been in some doubt
Sis to the nature of the tissue. In fact, T employ whatever means appears most suitable
the occasion and most likely to lead me to the truth. But IT still contend, that
clearness, sharpness of outline and fine definition under the higher powers, —for the
tage of obtaining thick sections of great transparency, and for the durability and
Amechangeableness of the preparations when properly made, I know of no method that
Sill bear any comparison with this. 'To confirm this opinion in one respect, I may
Fhention the fact, that although STILLING, in his recent work, has described and repre-
Zented the spiral structure of the fibres of the white columns of the Calf under a power
Df 1100 diameters, he has failed to detect the nucleated cells and nuclei which are 80
Seantifully seen by means of my method under a power of 350 diameters. D

= EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. Fig. 1, Plate XIX. represents a transverse section of the caput corn posterioris and part
= of the cerviz cornu, with a portion of the surrounding posterior and lateral
EZ white columns: from the middle of the cervical enlargement of the Ox ;
2 drawn from a preparation magnified 50 diameters :—A, A, A, part of the poste-
WE: rior white column ; B, B, part of the lateral column : the small circles and
S dark spots represent the cut ends of longitudinal and oblique fibres. 'These
5 columns are traversed by a beautiful network of blood-vessels and nerve-tibres
A radiating from all parts of the grey substance.
