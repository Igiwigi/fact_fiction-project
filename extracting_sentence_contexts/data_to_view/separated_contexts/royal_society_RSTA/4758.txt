Equality of the two expressions for follows from the nullity of Z%, since 0 = d(Z%Zq) = Z¢dZ +
ZqAZ. At this point, the idea is to appeal to the procedures of geometric quantization [9], according
to which a bundle connection is provided, the bundle being a circle bundle over the symplectic
manifold (here p\/) under consideration, the curvature of this connection being the given
2-form ®. In the present situation, we are fortunate in the fact that the appropriate circle bundle,
namely N, is already to hand, the circle being the phase freedom in 14, where the momentum null
(co-)vector pa, taken to scale the rays, is spinorially split:

Pa=ara’; with phase freedom zy +> een (0 real). The 2-spinor zy’ is also taken parallel-propagated along each ray y—providing a -scaled
ray [’—the phase freedom applying to each ray as a whole. This defines our required bundle
7-space NV.
