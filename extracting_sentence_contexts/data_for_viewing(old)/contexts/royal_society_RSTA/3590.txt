(h) Hydrogen as a detergent

Alan Sturt May I make a rather rude chemical suggestion? Rude in this
environment of engineers. It looks as if this hydrogen is acting almost
exactly like a detergent. If there is an area, a space in a metal matrix to
stick to, it will. You were talking about the rate at which things appear,
hydrogen before or after a crack—it is probably already there. If you’ve
got hydrogen around, it will soak through the whole structure, and as
the opportunity appears, it’ll stick to it. That prevents the metal matrix
sticking back together again, and that’s an amateurish explanation of in
fact almost all of your initial questions.

Perhaps you are being far too sophisticated, especially when you get : 2
into quantum mechanics and the rest of it. I mean, a hydrogen atom is : >
a quantum if you like, but all atoms are. I notice we’ve slipped from : 8
hydrogen atoms, which I mentioned in an early talk on fasteners. I bo
asked for clarification and it was all rather pooh-poohed; of course it’s : ~
hydrogen atoms. But then quite a lot had been said about hydrogen ——
molecules, which are not at all the same thing, and oxygen molecules, : 4
which are certainly not the same thing. They are producing the same : S
kind of effect. : =
