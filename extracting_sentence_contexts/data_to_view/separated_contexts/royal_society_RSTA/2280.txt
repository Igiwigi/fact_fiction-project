By convexity, we can ignore the convex mixture of different machines, i.e.
on yz in equation (5.8), and choose a fixed pure state 7, e.g. xt =(1,0,...,0). Moreover, since we
are limited to sequences of length two, for any strategy, i.e. initial state 7 and transition matrices
{T(a|x)}a,x, one can obtain the same value of Bs with a measure-and-prepare strategy. In fact, T(a|x)
can be substitute with the measurement of the effect vector fa) = T(a|x)n and a preparation of the
state m*T(a|x)/(2*falx). The expression can, then, be further simplified to depend quadratically
only on two parameters, corresponding to the effect fojo and finally solved analytically (cf. the
study of Budroni et al. [17] for details). We obtain

Qrit = F- (5.20)

Moreover, an optimal machine is given by the initial state xt* = (1,0) and the transition matrices

Notice that the solution is not unique.


(ii) Qubit
The quantum case can be similarly simplified by using AoT conditions, convexity arguments and
measure-and-prepare strategies.
