HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. 371

suggested scheme of actual lines may therefore be represented as follows where
Dy, D,, stand for the normal type, and D,,(m) = D,, (m) (—550,) :-—

Dy, (4), D,, (4)
(+0) Dy (5), Dy (5)
(+9) Dy (6), Dy, (6)
(+23) D,, (7), (+8) D,. (7)
Dy, (8)
(+8) Dj, (9)

(+6 or +54,) Dy, (10). The order (4) of the first line is so large that the error limits are too wide for absolute
certainty. In fact better agreement on the whole for the satellites would be
obtained by taking the difference as 564,, i.¢., 40,,, 6, being specially associated with
this group (see p. 331). The line 6269'28 is separated from 6266°36 by 6°44, and is
therefore possibly the lateral (+28) D,, (5). The table shows of course the known essential difference between the behaviour of
the elements of Group 2 and that of Groups 1, 3, 6, signified by the signs of « in the
formula.
