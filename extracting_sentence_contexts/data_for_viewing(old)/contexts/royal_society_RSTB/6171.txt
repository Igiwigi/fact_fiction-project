The subthalamus in Echidna differs little from that of other mammals although
the tractus strio-subthalamicus might be considered a peculiarity. The fact that
the ventral nuclei of the medial and lateral geniculate bodies are extensions of the
subthalamus is in accordance with their phylogenetic history. Kapprrs (1921) and
Le Gros Crark (1932, a) have shown that the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate
body has evolved from the subthalamus, and the latter author (1933) has shown
that the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate body has a similar origin. Already
in Echidna this process has been initiated for both nuclei.

The cerebral peduncles are peculiar in that they contain no representative of the
fronto-pontine fibres of other mammals and that the pyramidal tracts lie exposed
at their medial border. It has been emphazised that the substantia nigra is confined
to the medial border of the peduncle in close association with the pyramidâ€”a fact
which accords with its supposed motor function. In the figures which Hines shows
of this region in Ornithorhynchus the substantia nigra similarly lies at the medial
border of the peduncle.

Scuusrer (1910) mapped the cortical pattern in Echidna and was unable to differ-
entiate more than five areas (he does not describe the occipital region). The
largest of these is area 3 which occupies the anterior two-thirds or more of the
lateral surface of the hemisphere. Martin (1898) found that the electrically
excitable cortex in Ornithorhnychus occupies the anterior two-thirds of the lateral
