80 that we have the kingdom 57 consisting of the single region P, the kingdom r +4
consisting of the regions Q and T, and the kingdom 3r+27 consisting of the regions
R, S, and U.

283. For a given equation if D is =—, the character is 3r +27; if D=+, J=+, the
character is +44; if D=+, J=—, then, according as 2!"L—J* is =+ or is =—; the
character is 5r or r+4i, But in the last case the distinction between the characters 5r
and +47 may be presented in a more general form, involving a parameter þ, arbitrary
between certain limits. In fact drawing upwards from the origin, as in Plate, fig. 3, the
lines xz—2y=0 and z+y=0, and between them any line whatever z+wy= 0, the point

region P if 7+py is =—, in the region Q if 7+py is =+. But we have
