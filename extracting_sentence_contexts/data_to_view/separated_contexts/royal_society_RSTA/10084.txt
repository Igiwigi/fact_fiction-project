The number registered by the revolution counter in about
2 minutes was usually taken when determining the speed. It was found that the
speed observed agreed very nearly with that deduced from the speed of the motor
and size of the pulleys, and also that the speed remained very constant for long
intervals of time. In fact, no appreciable variation of the speed ever occurred
during any of the experiments, the results of which are recorded in this paper. The motor and solenoid were run from two different sets of cells, so that varying the
eurrent in the solenoid did not affect the voltage on the motor. This latter voltage
was always indicated by a Weston voltmeter, so that if any change in it occurred, it
was at once known that something was wrong.
