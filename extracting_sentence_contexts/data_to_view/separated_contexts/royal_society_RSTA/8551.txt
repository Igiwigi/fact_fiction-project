it.* On the other hand, the extreme sensitiveness of the rotatory power of tartaric
acid to changes of temperature, concentration and solvent was regarded by Bior as
one of the chief anomalies in the behaviour of this exceptional substance. Buior had
laid stress on the fact that the optical rotatory power} of a substance was usually inde-
pendent of the conditions under which it was observed; thus the rotatory power of
turpentine was not affected by diluting it with other essential oils (‘ Mém. Acad. Sci.,’
1817, vol. 2, p. 115), or with ether (ibid., p. 116), and it even retained its optical activity
when examined as a vapour in a column 30 metres in length (ibid., pp. 126-133,
compare Gernez, ‘ Ann. de |’Ecole Norm.,’ vol. 1, p. 1); cane sugar, too, showed a
very similar rotatory power when examined in the amorphous solid state as “ barley
sugar’ and when this same product was dissolved in water (‘ Mém.
