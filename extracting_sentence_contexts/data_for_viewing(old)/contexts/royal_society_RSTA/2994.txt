strength of the anti-Hermitian part does not exceed a certain critical value, above which the PT 1B
symmetry breaks down, i.e. the energy spectra ceases to be real [2-9]. For one-dimensional single- :
particle Hamiltonians, which include a complex potential, L(x) = V(x) + iW(x), whose imaginary
part is the anti-Hermitian term in the Hamiltonian, the PT symmetry implies that the real and
imaginary parts of the potential are, respectively, even and odd functions of the coordinate [2]:

V(x) =V(—x) and W(—x) =—W(x). (1.1)

While the concept of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians was not experimentally realized in the
framework of the quantum theory, a possibility was proposed to emulate the symmetry in optical Dos
media with symmetrically placed gain and loss elements [10-24], making use of the commonly : =
known similarity between the Schrédinger equation in quantum mechanics and the equation : a
governing light propagation in the paraxial approximation. In fact, this setting may be considered 73
as a specific example of the general class of dissipated structures, the concept of which was aes
developed by Prigogine and co-workers [25]. This prediction was followed by the experimental 22
implementation of the PT symmetry in various optical waveguides [26-29] and lasers [30,31], as : S
well as in other photonic media, such as metamaterials [32], microcavities [33], optically induced : s
atomic lattices [34] and exciton—polariton condensates [35-37]. : S

The PT symmetry can be emulated in other waveguiding settings too, such as acoustics : &

[38,39], optomechanical systems [40] and electronic circuits [41]. It was predicted too in atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) [42] and magnetism [43]. In terms of the theory, PT-symmetric
extensions were also elaborated for Korteweg-de Vries [44,45], Burgers [46] and sine-Gordon [47]
equations, as well as in a model combining the PT symmetry with emulation of the spin-orbit
