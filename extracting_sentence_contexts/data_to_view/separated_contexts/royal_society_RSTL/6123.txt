The comparison of the boiling-points of the corresponding terms in the several series
of homologous substances given in the preceding Tables, exhibits several other con-
stant differences in the boiling-points for certain differences in the formulze. In addition

to those hitherto noticed, the following also deserve to be mentioned, since they are like-
wise observed in other compounds. The foregoing Tables afford many illustrations of the facts, that the boiling-point of an
acid lies 63? higher than that of the methyl-ether, 44* higher than that of the ethyl-ether,
and 132 lower than that of the amyl-ether of the same acid. These regularities appear
to obtain in the case of acids other than those quoted.
