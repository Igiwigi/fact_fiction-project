occur in larger birds that lay repeat clutches after nest failure,
it is unlikely to occur in small birds that lay multiple clutches
because they rely mostly on income to fuel reproduction.
Among mammals, evidence for such a routine seasonal altera-
tion from capital-aided to pure income breeding seems rare. A
notable exception, however, is the European brown hare (Lepus
europaeus). Brown hares typically have 3 (up to 5) litters per
year with an average litter size of 2-3 young [112]. In
Europe, the breeding season lasts from January to October
and litter size peaks in summer (approx. 2.5 young per litter),
while only 1-2 young per litter are born early in the season
(Jan-Mar; [113]). This lower litter size at breeding onset has
been attributed to the fact that young born early in the
season are costly. They are exposed to low ambient tempera-
tures, entirely lack burrows or nests, and hence have high
energetic costs of thermoregulation [113]. Although hares are
