in the air, and proved to be mere oxide of manganese, un-
contaminated by iron, and amounting to half a grain.

Manganese has been suspected in various species of cast
iron; and though Mr. Musner's experiments go to prove
that it does not usually/ enter in abundance, they can hardly
be regarded as establishing the fact of its absence. It might
not: be uninteresting to resume the investigation with the
aid of a mode of analysis 80 well adapted to experiments
on a large scale, as I have no doubt that, with proper care,
one part in a thousand, or even less, of manganese might be
insulated from iron.

The separation of iron from uranium cannot be accom-
plished by the process above described, that metal possessing
a property analogous to that which forms the subject of this
paper. By inverting the process, however, we shall succeed
even here. A mixed solution' of iron and uranium being
de-oxidized by a current of sulphuretted hydrogen, and then
