52 SIR J. B. LAWES AND PROFESSOR J. H. GILBERT ON THE

We trust, therefore, that M. Deniratn will accept our comments in all friendliness,
when we say that our own dearly bought experience leads us to believe that the above
facts are quite sufficient to render approximately accurate quantitative estimates at
the different periods impossible. From the results, it seems probable that the samples
taken at the commencement of the experiments in 1875 were less comparable with
those of 1878 and 1879, than were those of these later dates with those of 1881 and
1885. ‘Lhe losses indicated were, indeed, in most cases, much less over the second
period of 4 years; a result which is, however, doubtless partly due to the fact that no
manure was applied during that period.
