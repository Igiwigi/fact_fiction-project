My dissections of Birds have included all the orders, and, in most instances, several
families from each : I have never failed to find the thyroid gland, or to recognise its
peculiar structure : I accordingly presume that it is universally present in this class
of animals. Of its relative position it is unnecessary to say much more than is included in the
notices of previous observers, and I will merely mention that its relation to the Jarynx
seems neither essential nor constant. A more uniform and more important relation
is included in the fact, that the gland always corresponds to a particular spot of the
vascular system ; namely, that it lies on the cervical yessels, and receives its supply
of blood just opposite to the point at which the vertebral and carotid arteries diverge
to their respective destinations. II. Reptiles.
