These cavities represent the cast of some organic body which
was in connection with the frond in the angle between the two arms of the frond. This
structure is not described by Krpston. Taking all these facts into consideration, it seems highly probable that the fertile
rachis, seen on the right of the specimen (Plate 17, fig. 24, Â¢), was either itself attached to
the top of the main rachis in the angle of the fork, in the position suggested by the presence
of the small structure, or was a branch of some rachis attached in that position. The attachments of the other groups of cupules are not shown, but the orientation of
the several cupules is in most instances such that the cupule segments point towards
the centre of a sphere on the surface of which the cupules lie.
