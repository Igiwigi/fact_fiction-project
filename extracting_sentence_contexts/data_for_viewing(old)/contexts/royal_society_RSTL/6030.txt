Eblue, yellow, green, orange, violet, and white), the dichromically colour-blind have
—only three, namely, two primary colours, and the secondary one produced by their
Ycombination.
= The first mention of the dichromic explanation of colour-blindness is in a letter from
SSir Jonx HerscneL to Dr. DauTox, which, though dated 2nd of May, 1833, was only
Ppubliched i in Hexmr's © Life of Darrox ' in 1854. I have little more to do than to show

colours which T really do see, and which I can at once identify with those called, by the
