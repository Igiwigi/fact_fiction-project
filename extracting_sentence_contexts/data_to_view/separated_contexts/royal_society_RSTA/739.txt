There are instances where such ‘challenges’ can generate the core of a
TV proposition. However, the disconnect between viewer and subject within such systems-rooted
issues tends to be significant, even before the weighing of expert evidence on any particular
question is considered. Hence even where the proposed strategies are impressive and wide
ranging in scale, and where publics/audiences/voters will not be challenged in terms of impacts


on daily life, it remains difficult for specialist factual media to derive more than an occasional story
that can make it through the intensely competitive process of winning a broadcast commission. But having noted the limits of process efficiency Allwood et al. [14] go further to present
what is arguably an even more challenging theme for mass-audience broadcasting. They
propose the need for ‘reduction in overall volumes of material production’.
