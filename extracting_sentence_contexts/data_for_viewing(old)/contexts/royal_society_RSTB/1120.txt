In the case of the sciatic nerve, the alteration seemed to us to be the same in
extent whichever event occurred ; that is to say, the resting difference for the first
30 minutes slowly diminished in amount at the average rate of tgdqq Daniell per
minute, this rate of diminution becoming less afterwards.

It is, however, questionable to what extent in the suspended and isolated nerve, the
physiological. conditions which are dependent upon continuity with the cord are
maintained by any facilities which the preservation of vessels affords for keeping up a
circulation in the nerve, since this must be, undoubtedly, greatly impaired by the
exposure. The conditions of vitality would rather seem to be linked with the
maintenance of physiological connection with other nerve structures, around which
an active circulation is still being carried on, and which, therefore, retain their normal
vital characteristics. That this is probable is shown by the fact that when, as some-
times occurs, the nerve difference, owing to rapid drying, shows a steady rise in
amount, which rise continues even when no evidence of circulation in the exposed
nerve is obvious, the rise is immediately counterbalanced and converted into a fall on
systemic death of the animal, this fall occurring pari passu with the loss of excita-
bility in the central nerve structures. ‘

(c.) Physiological Changes Connected with Haxcitation.—The alterations due to
excitation were after effects, that is, they followed the development of the transient
excitatory change and consisted in a permanent slight diminution in the previously
existing difference, such as has been observed to follow nerve excitation in the case of
the Frog.
