attributed to errors arising from stray light. Such an assumption is untenable as an
explanation of the form of the loci in fig. 7. Apart from the precautions taken in both
investigations to exclude stray light, neither curve exhibits the sharp curl inwards

towards white which would be caused by appreciable impurity in this part of the
spectrum.

A second feature of both curves is the slight inward bend at 0-43 u. When this
feature was observed in the N.P.1. curve, I attributed it to experimental error, as
the displacement from a curve without this bend is completely sub-limenal. The fact,
however, that the same phenomenon, despite its slightness, emerges from the results
of the two separate investigations, suggests that it may be real, for I am unable to
account for it by any peculiarity in experimental conditions which could be common
to both investigations. The wave-length at which it occurs was, of course, in a different
relationship to the working primaries in the two investigations, and the actual colour
matches involved in determining this point on the locus were quite dissimilar in the
two cases.

As regards the divergence of the two loci, this would be sub-limenal in a single colour
match except, perhaps, towards the extreme end of the spectrum.

The general conclusion to be drawn from this comparison is that WricHâ€™s results
