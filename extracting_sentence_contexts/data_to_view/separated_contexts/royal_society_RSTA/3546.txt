Therefore, it is normal
that a trend of lower NFS»,1.2v is observed with decreasing tempering temperature as shown
in figure 15. However, the data points show a poor fit to the binomial trend line. This poor
fit is explained by the fact that tempering temperature does not have a direct effect on HE
susceptibility. Rather, tempering temperature determines the final as-tempered microstructure,
which in turn has second-order effects on hydrogen damage and transport and trapping
mechanisms.

4. Discussion

(a) Threshold curve

Threshold results presented thus far were obtained under a single hydrogen charging condition
(ie. —1.20V).
