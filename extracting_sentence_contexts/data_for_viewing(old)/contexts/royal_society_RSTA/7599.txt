as to the constancy of the specific heat of argon.

A further explanation was sought and this led to consideration being given to the
effect of the temperature gradient in the gas mixture at the maximum explosion pres-
sure. A preliminary study some years earlier had indicated that the gradient might be
very pronounced, and this had suggested that in view of the rapid change in dissociation
with change in temperature the effect might be very substantial. This, however, was
not supported by Lewis and yon Elbe who went into the matter much more thoroughly
(1934c¢) and came to the conclusion that in certain mixtures the smoothing out of the
gradient—without loss of internal energy—would cause a rise of the explosion pressure
of less than 1%. A closer study of their work showed that although these corrections
were small they tended to group themselves according to mixture composition, and the
fact that they were highest where argon was concerned seemed to be sufficiently
significant to justify the calculation of similar corrections in the case of the fourth series
of the “ Matched Explosions”. These calculations were made by the method already
indicated, and it was found that the corrections varied sufficiently with the type of

mixture to make the simultancous solution of the corrected equations—based on
“cage” heat losses—yield an argon molecular heat value of just under 2-98,

This was followed by the calculation of gradient corrections for nearly all the
mixtures of the other three series with equally satisfactory results. On applying these
corrections, the molecular heats of carbon monoxide, nitrogen and carbon dioxide in
terms of argon were found to increase with temperature as shown by the curves marked
C in fig. 14. Further, the simultaneous solution of the corrected equations—based on
