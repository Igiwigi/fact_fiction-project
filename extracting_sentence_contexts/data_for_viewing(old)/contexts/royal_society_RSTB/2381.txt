This table shows that in the early stages of degeneration the amount of phosphorus
is not far removed from the normal. It is on the 8th day, when the Marchi reaction
becomes well marked, that the first great drop in the percentage of phosphorus
oceurs. It continues to diminish and has practically disappeared by the 25th, and
absolutely by the 29th day. With signs of commencing restoration of function it
reappears, and is near the normal in the last two cats where regeneration had
occurred.

We have confined our observations to the peripheral parts of the nerves.*

We can now pass on to the histological side of the subject ; after which we shall
be better able to correlate our facts and draw general conclusions.

* Nott (loc. cit.) in some of his experiments examined the central stump of the divided nerve. He was
able to perform some of his work on large animals (horses) and so could obtain sufficient material from
the central end for analysis. Corresponding to what is termed “ disuse atrophy ” he found some diminu-
tion in the amount of protagon in this region, hut the lessening was not so marked as in the peripheral
end of the nerve. In the majority of his experiments he estimated protagon, not phosphorus as we have
done. He puts the date of disappearance of the phosphorised fat at 28 days. This date and many other
of his facts fit in very well with our work.
