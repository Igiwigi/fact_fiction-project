Whether we are awake or asleep is often thought to make a difference not just to
behaviour, but also to our conscious mental states. More specifically, which be-
havioural state a person is in at a particular time is believed to constrain which
conscious state a person is in at that time and whether they are conscious at all.
Both in folk-psychology and in prominent dream theories, conscious experience
in sleep, in the form of dreaming, is thought to differ in characteristic ways from
waking thought and experience [1]. In this view, there is a deep rift between the
types of conscious states experienced in sleep and wakefulness.

Others reject the idea that differences in conscious states map onto differ-
ences in behavioural states. Often, this is framed as the idea that there is
continuity between dreaming and waking. This continuity can refer to the
fact that we tend to dream of things we experience, think, or worry about in
waking [2-4]. Or it can mean that dreams are the same type of mental state
as waking imagination and daydreams and both are distinct from perception
[5]. More recently, dreaming has been described as an intensified form of
waking mind wandering existing on a continuum of spontaneous experiences
