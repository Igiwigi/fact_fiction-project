Although in view of these difficulties any detailed discussion of the absolute values of
the amplitudes (see table 2) would be unprofitable, it is of interest to consider how big the
amplitude should be for the field close to the b-axis if only the single ellipsoid relevant in
this region is taken into account. From the periods, if we extrapolate as in figure 7, we have
that the mass ratios are m,:m :m, = 3:75:11-6:1, and from the absolute value of # extra-
polated to the b-axis (3-4 x 10~!®) we obtain (m,mg,)*/my as 0-054, where my is the ordinary
electron mass; we thus find

m,/mg = 0-104, m,/my = 0-32 and m,/m, = 0-028.

Knowing the value of x, all the data are available for calculating the amplitude according
to the theoretical formula, and it turns out that for y = 78-9° in the ab-plane, T = 4-22° Kand
1/H = 0-65 x 10~4, the amplitude should be 7 x 10~®. The fact that the experimental value,
17 x 10~$, is higher than that predicted theoretically is puzzling, since, as was mentioned on
p. 5, if the theoretical formula has to be modified to take proper account of the disturbing
influence of the lattice this modification would probably reduce rather than increase the
theoretically predicted values. It is, however, not impossible that the discrepancy between
the observed and predicted amplitudes is due to an over-simplified description of the
Fermi surface rather than any failing of the theoretical formula.

A similar analysis can also be made for the ellipsoid mainly responsible for the de Haas-
van Alphen effect near the c-axis. If the subsidiary periods are ignored, we find (though the
extrapolations here are less reliable than for the b-axis) m,:m,:m3 = 0-52:0-055:1, and
from the absolute value of # along the c-axis, we have (m,m,)'/my = 0-067, so that
