Herman, proposed that the early universe was not only very dense but also very hot 1B
and showed that in such a universe the ratio of the matter density to the cube of the temperature :
of heat radiation is a constant (see [49,50] for an insightful presentation of their findings). Hence, if one measured that density and ratio today, they could find the present temperature :
of the leftover radiation. The authors gave an estimate of this temperature about 5 degrees :s
Kelvin, but no one gave any serious attention to this result back then and went completely :
unnoticed, despite the fact that this prediction was no other than that of the later discovered a
cosmic microwave background thermal radiation left from a very early stage, the hot big bang, in â€”
the evolution of the homogeneous universe. a)

This is a tremendous result equivalent to the discovery of a radiation era in the early universe Dh
with density exceeding that of matter. Also, this radiation survives until today with a much D8
cooler temperature. It took more than 15 years until the cosmic microwave background radiation, [<3
observationally discovered by Penzias and Wilson in 1965, convincingly explained by R.
