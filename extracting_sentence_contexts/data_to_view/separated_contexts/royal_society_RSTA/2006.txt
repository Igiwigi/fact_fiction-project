The potential distributions
commonly used in the literature lead to a spatial decay in the strength of interaction between
two particles, before reaching the final annihilation of their bond. This spatial decay can also be
modelled using the VO-RL derivative of a constant. In fact, from equation (3.1), it is seen that the
RL derivative of a constant decays with the independent variable. Thus, it appears that any spatial
decay in the bond strengths can also be modelled by using a space-fractional RL derivative. This
decay rate can be tuned using an appropriate order variation which is functionally dependent on
the selected potential field.
