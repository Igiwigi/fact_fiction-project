Following Mostow rigidity, this automatically implies that the manifold be
hyperbolic. Contrary to the situation in 3+ 1 dimensions, the fixed points are not isolated in
higher dimensions. This is due to the fact that the Einstein moduli space is finite dimensional
for n>3 (but collapses to a point for 1 =3). Such cases are handled by invoking a ‘shadow’
gauge introduced by [26]. Here however, we only state the result for the physically interesting
3+ 1 dimensional case where such moduli spaces do not appear.
