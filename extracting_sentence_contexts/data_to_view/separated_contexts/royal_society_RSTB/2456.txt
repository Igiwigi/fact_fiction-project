Some of the Sub-ungulates, a few Rodents, and the Edentata are the only other
placental Mammals similarly devoid of retinal vessels. Is this primitive condition of
the eye of the Bats due to arrested development or partial degeneration of that
particular organ through disuse, or must we regard it as disputing the high rank
which zoologists have assigned to these strange Mammals? Typical Vespertilionse
are undoubtedly met with in the Eocene epoch, a fact which favours the view that
the Bats are really a low, although in many respects a highly-specialised, order. (See
also Part IL., p. 68.)
