evidence of actual change in them is s0 incomplete as well as s limited in its range, as
to be quite inadequate of itself to establish their community of descent, yet when that
evidence is considered in its relations to analogous facts drawn from the far greater
variations of domesticated animals, and to the manifold gradations by which the
extreme types are connected, physiologists of the highest eminence have felt themselves
Justified in accepting that community as probable. Now the modifications which any
single type of Foraminifera must have undergone, to give origin to the whole series of
diversified forms presented by that group, are not greater in comparison with those of
which we have direct evidence, than are those which the advocate for the Specific
Vnity of the Human Races has no hesitation in assuming as the probable account of
their present divergence,

257. This view of the case derives great force from the fact, that there is strong reason
to regard a large proportion of the existing Foraminifera as the direct lineal descend-
ants of those of very ancient geological periods ;—a doctrine first adyanced by Professor
EHRENBERG in regard to a considerable number of Cretaceous forms ; since fully con-
firmed and extended as regards the Tertiary fauna by the admirable researches of
Messrs. Rueerr Joxes and PARKER on the Rhizopodal Fauna of the Mediterranean, as
well as by my own comparison of the recent and ſossil types of Orbitolites, Orbiculing,
Alveolina, Operculina, and Calcarina; and shown to be applicable also to the Secondary

fauna, as far back as the upper part of the Triassic system, by the remarkable results of
the investigations of the same gentlemen in regard to a well-preseryed sample of it.
Following out, by laborious and extended comparison, the method of inquiry I haye 80
much insisted on, they have found ample evidence that the fact of a wide range of varia-
