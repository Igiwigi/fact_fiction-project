an invaluable aid for helping us resolve the brain’s mysteries. Indeed,
we think that the consideration of evolutionary history ought to take its
place alongside other intellectual tools used to understand the brain, such

we argue for the importance of evolution by highlighting specific examples
of ways that evolutionary theory can enhance neuroscience. The rest of the

neural evolution, the important consequences of specific transitions that
