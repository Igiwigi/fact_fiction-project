I have just received a long communication,
partly printed and part in MS., in which he describes many fresh experiments, and
adduces arguments to show that my dynamical explanation is not sufficient to account
for more than a few of the facts he describes, and saying that he “ persists in still
believing that this force emanates from the observer, or else that the observer is the
indispensable intermediary for its manifestation.” The experiments are numerous, and are devised with great ingenuity. It is
impossible in the space of a brief abstract to do more than refer to a few of the
principal facts here brought forward. M. Tuore commences by objecting to my
having experimented in an enclosed space, saying that he always operates in free air. He thinks that enclosure may almost or quite suppress his force.
