Elongation directions appear to
stabilize below this. Comparison of the vertical girdle LPO presented in the standard glaciological stereographic
projections into the horizontal (figure 5c) with grain elongations in horizontal sections (figure 5b,
right column) shows that the mean orientation of the girdle plane, that is, the average
plane containing all c-axes, and the orientation of the grain elongations in the horizontal are
perpendicular to each other.

(d) Visual stratigraphy

The visual stratigraphy in the uppermost 950m is generally horizontal, straight and faint
(figure 52). The last feature results from the fact that air bubbles in this zone are by far the
largest and most efficient light scatterers, so that the visual stratigraphy is dominated by depth
variations in the number and size of air bubbles. The ice core in this zone appears so bright under
the LS that the recorded images seem partially washed out, with a faint stratigraphy. Within
the bubble-hydrate transition zone (BHT zone, 800-1200 m [84]), stratigraphic variations in the
number and size of air bubbles gradually increase with depth.
