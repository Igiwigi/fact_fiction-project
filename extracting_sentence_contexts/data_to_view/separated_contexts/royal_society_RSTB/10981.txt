The set-size view takes our pre-
theoretical thought and talk literally: ‘class size’ in normal
parlance refers to the number of pupils in a class, and ‘family
size’ refers to the number of family members. This view has advantages over each of the previous
views. It coheres with mathematical practice in taking each
numeral to denote a single cardinal number (unlike the clas-
sical view); it is consistent with the fact that there are
infinitely many finite cardinal numbers (unlike mentalism);
and it allows for facts about numbers which are independent
of any and all numeral systems. However, the set-size view of cardinal numbers runs into
the cognitive access problem. I will put this in the form of
an argument.
