Recently, a further improvement to the JKR theory was suggested in the works by Popov and : =

describe adhesive contact between a rigid indenter and an elastic layer of finite thickness by
means of introducing correction factors into the classical JKR relations for elastic half-spaces. The above mentioned approach [24,25] contains a priori assumptions, such as constant contact
stiffness during the virtual ‘unloading’ stage. Those assumption are required to reach the true
configuration of the system in the JKR approach.
