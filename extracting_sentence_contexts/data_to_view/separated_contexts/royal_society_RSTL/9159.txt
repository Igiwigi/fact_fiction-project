that he has only sueceeded in finding a
record of four specimens of this species in European collections. The writer has
omitted to notice that in the British Museum © List of Anseres,” &c. (p. 52), pub-
lished by the late Mr. G. R. Gray in 1844, no less than seven specimens are
mentioned, and I now give a complete list of the birds at present in the national
collection. I would call attention to the fact that the bird from the Orozettes
seems to have darker legs than the Kerguelen hird : whether this occurs only in the
dried skin, or is to be found in the living Sheathbill, must be left for future visitors
to these islands to determine. a. b. ad. c. Juv. sﬆt. Kerguelen Island.
