formed.

Tt is obvious that the method of heart formation exhibited by Hstheria resembles
very closely the typical Arthropodan type. It differs only in that the cardiac cavity
appears as a split in a continuous mass of mesoderm that completely surrounds the
gut, whereas in the typical Arthropodan type the mesoderm grows up on either side
of the gut to include the mid-dorsal part of the primary body cavity. The development
of Branchipus, and of other Crustacea such as Oniscus and Mysis, in this respect
resembles more closely the usual type than does that of Estheria. In the latter, however,
it is probable that if it were possible to work out the embryonic development of the
nauplius, it would be found that the mesoderm originates as a ventral mass that grows
up on either side of the gut, and so completely surrounds the gut by the time that the
egg hatches. In support of this is the fact that in the earliest nauplius, while the
mesoderm is definitely continuous around the gut, it forms a very thin layer in the
mid-dorsal line, much thinner than elsewhere.

Tt must be mentioned here that Nowi1korr (19), in a monograph on the anatomy of
a form nearly related to Estheria, Limnadia lenticularis L., suggests a method by which
the heart may be formed in which he assumes that the pericardial cavity is the primary
body cavity, the coelom remaining as the perivisceral cavity. This suggestion, however,
is not based on any embryological evidence and will not be more than mentioned here.

While the method of heart formation in the Arthropoda shows a uniformity throughout
the group, it cannot be said that the accounts of the subsequent fate of the dorsal parts
of the coelom pouches after the heart tube has been formed show any such agreement.
