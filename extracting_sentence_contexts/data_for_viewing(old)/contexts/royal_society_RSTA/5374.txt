While introducing the mathematical model of non-homogeneous beam heating, the effect of :s
anomalous diffusion was taken into account (see [9] for details of anomalous diffusion, and =
[10] for subdiffusion parameter measurement). On the other hand, the control of such thermal i=
plants has been discussed previously [11-13], in which a fractional order proportional-integral— :g
derivative-type controller has been employed to solve the temperature control problem. In this 73
paper, the use of a fractional order calculus to model the heating process using a thermoelectric :
module also known as the Peltier module is presented.

This paper is organized as follows. In §2, the basic facts on fractional calculus are described.
Section 3 gives a mathematical description of the heating process. In §4, experimental verification
of the heating process model is described. Section 5 concludes this article with some comments
and ideas for further work.

2. Fractional calculus

A fractional order differential calculus is a generalization of the integer order integral and
derivative to real or even complex order. This idea first emerged at the end of the seventeenth
century and has been developed in the area of mathematics throughout the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries in the works of, for example, Liouville, Riemann, Cauchy, Abel, Griinwald
and many others. More recently, by the end of the twentieth century, it turned out that some
physical phenomena are modelled more accurately when fractional calculus is used. There exist
