Thus, the dominant component of ISM dust condensed
in molecular clouds, was released, reprocessed in the ISM by shocks and cosmic rays, and
recycled into and out of molecular clouds [58]. Cosmic-ray exposure causes amorphization [48]
and transforms Fe in the crystal lattice to nanophase Fe® (nFe) [17,44,48,52] and is hypothesized
to produce nFeS [59]. In fact, amorphous olivine or amorphous pyroxene are very unstable
and would rapidly crystallize. For an amorphous silicate to be metastable, it needs to be off-
stoichiometry, which also usually means highly ‘defected’ and having lots of dangling bonds,
such as occurs by cosmic-ray damage [48,52,60]. Cosmic-ray exposure typically is thought to occur
in the ISM.
