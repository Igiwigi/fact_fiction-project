experimental and theoretical material of all subsequent sections of this paper. In
spite of this it would seem to be more convenient to bring forward even at this stage
the main conclusions on this all-important point, so that the proposed underlying
interpretation may always be kept in mind and an appreciation of the extensive data
thereby considerably facilitated.

The most obvious feature of the three phases is their increasing power of resistance,
either to mechanical extension or to chemical change, and from this limited point of
view it is most tempting to suppose that they correspond merely to outer and inner
“ ghells ” of chain-bundles or “ micelles”; that is to say, to regions of increasing organi-
zation or crystallinity as we proceed from the outskirts of any chain-bundle into its
interior. Such an idea would satisfy well enough the fundamental postulate from the
experimental facts, that the phases must be both in series and in parallel, but would
be difficult to harmonize with certain phenomena which must be accounted for in any
plausible working hypothesis. The chief of these are: (i) that the load/extension
curves for all sorts of animal hairs do not show any striking quantitative variation
from one type of fibre to another, and (ii) that the most “ crystalline ” phase appears
to be K,, the second in order of ease of extension and general resistance to chemical
attack. Without the use of a photometer we cannot yet be quite certain on this
second count, but at the moment of writing it would appear that the greatest change
in the X-ray photographs takes place in the middle range of the full transformation ;
that is, in the range which we have ascribed to the phase K,. Point (i) is perhaps
more decisive, since the concept of the three phases as being based on gradations in
the organization of chain-bundles is effectively equivalent to a theory of mixtures,
sub-microscopic mixtures which would hardly be expected to remain substantially
