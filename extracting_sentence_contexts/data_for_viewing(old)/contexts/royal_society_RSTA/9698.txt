Summary.

1. The most important result of the discussion would seem to be the considerable
weight of evidence, in addition to that afforded in Part I., that the series lines—at
least the Principal and Sharp—depend in a very definite way on a certain physical
quantity peculiar to each element which is approximately measured by what is
generally understood as its atomic volume. The numerical evidence afforded from a
study of the low melting-point elements of the first three groups of the Periodic
Table is remarkably exact. The numerous lines of all these series are represented
within limits of error, and as a rule with extreme closeness, by the formula adopted.
The argument is based on the denominator of p(1), and this is determinable with
great exactness; in fact, any possible error in this due either to error of observations
or error in the limit chosen for the series will exert practically no influence on the
result.* A change in N might do so to some extent. Any uncertainty is due to
uncertainty in the values used for the atomic volume, which might amount to as
much as 1 per cent., ¢.g., changing 2740 by 30. The high melting-point elements of
Group IT. do not show the law with such certainty, but there are clear indications of it.
In these elements the type of formula has required a modification, and, in addition,
the series are not well developed in the higher members Sr, Ba and Ra. Consequently
the limits are not determined with such certainty as in the other cases. Nevertheless
Mg and Ca quite fall into line with the others, and even in Ra it is possible to give
some indications of the value of the density of the solid metal.

The fact that the terms depend on multiples of atomic volumes as ordinarily
