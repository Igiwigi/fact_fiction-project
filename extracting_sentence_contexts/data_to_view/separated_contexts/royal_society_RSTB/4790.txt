This agrees with Hooxerâ€™s finding for Eastern England. (ii) In all save the dunged plot 2B, the average loss is rapidly reduced during August,
an observation which finds a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of carting
the crop is August 24th, so that as August advances an increasing proportion of years
occur in which the rain is too late to affect the crop. The exceptional behaviour of
plot 28 indicates that the average loss per inch of rain in the month preceding harvest
is even heavier than that shown in the diagram. (iii) In all the plots October is a month
in which the average loss per inch of rain is small, or in which rain above the average is
positively beneficial.
