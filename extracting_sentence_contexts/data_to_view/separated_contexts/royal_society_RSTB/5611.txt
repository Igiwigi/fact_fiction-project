Hetuerineton and Haroup Ratstrick. Mannitol (C,H,,0,) is the most common of the naturally occurring hexahydric
alcohols. It is a curious fact that while glucose is the most commonly occurring
hexose, the corresponding alcohol, sorbitol, is of relatively uncommon occurrence,
while mannose and fructose, which are structurally related to mannitol, are not of
such common occurrence as glucose. Mannitol is a common constituent of many plants, but occurs principally in the
curious plant exudation known as “ manna,” and is at present produced technically
by two methods, both of which are open to obvious disadvantages. (a) From “ manna.”

(b) By the bacterial fermentation of fructose.
