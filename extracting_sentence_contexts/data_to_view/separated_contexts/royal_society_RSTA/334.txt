The first, fundamental question in analysis of such three-way data is whether the three-way
structure can be simply transformed into an ordinary two-way structure without losing too much
information. In other words, can we just ‘collapse’ the data into an ordinary matrix and analyse
it with ICA, or do we need special methods? In fact, in many cases where ICA is applied, it does
not seem to be necessary to construct special methods for analysis of three-way data: it seems to
be enough to transform the data into a single matrix for a useful application of ICA. Denote by X; the data matrix obtained from the kth condition (or subject). Its rows are the
different variables i, and the columns different observations t.
