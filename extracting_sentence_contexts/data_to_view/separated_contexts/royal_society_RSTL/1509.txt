The skull is
thirty-three inches long ; the largest of the recent rhinoceros
in the collection of the Royal College of Surgeons, is two feet. The drawing of the skull from Siberia is s0 accurate, as
to make a description of its external appearance unneces-
8ary ; it is however proper to add, that all the fossil skulls
that have been examined, are alike, and three feet long ;
80 that we have now acquired a nearer approach to the form
of the skull of the rhinoceros of former ages, in that which
is represented in these drawings, and is here described, than
has before been obtained. From this fact, s0 completely


found in the interior of Africa. 41

within my own observation, I am led to believe, that although
many animals belonging to former ages may be extinct, they
are not necessarily 80 ; no change having taken place in our
globe, which had destroyed all existing animals, and there-
fore 'many of them may be actually in being, although we
have not been able to discover them. When we consider that the course of one of the greatest
rivers in Africa, the Niger, has not been traced to its source
by any European traveller, we must allow, that great tracts
of country in that immense continent remain unexplored ; in
which those animals, that are not disposed by their nature
to submit to the will of man, but, on the contrary, to fly from
him, may conceal themselves, by retiring into the wild fast-
nesses of forests, which for ages to come may never be
visited by rational beings.
