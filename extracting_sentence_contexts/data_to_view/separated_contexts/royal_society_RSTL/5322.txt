In art. (6.) I extend these results to the case
of f and @ being of different dimensions in x. In art. (7.) I give a mechanical rule
for the construction of the Bezoutic square. In art. (8.) I show how the theory of
f(x) and 6(z), where the latter is of an inferior degree to f, may be brought under
the operation of the rule applicable to two, functions; of the, same. degree. at the
expense of the, introduction, of a, known and very. simple factor, which in fact will-be
a constant, power of the leading coefficient in F(x). In art. (9.) I give another method
of obtaining directly the simplified residues in all cases. Tn art. (10.) I present the

process of successive division under its most general aspect.
