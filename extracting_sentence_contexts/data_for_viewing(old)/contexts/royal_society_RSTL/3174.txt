I shall haye occasion hereafter to describe several other nearly insoluble resins,
differing in composition from those above described, but I may here introduce the
remark, that we are already prepared to anticipate unlike rational formulze for the
Soluble and insoluble resins; since the number of atoms of oxygen contained in our
empirical formulae appear to have no relation to these properties of solubility and

there are many others in which this fact is equally apparent.

/oteâ€”The disagreement between some of the details of the above examination of
the resin of SanDARAcH, and those of Unverporsex, to whom we are indebted for the
only previous methodical examination of a large number of the resins, is to be ascribed
chiefly I believe to the mode in which Unvgrporsex examined the resins. Being
unable to have recourse to the ultimate analysis of the substances he obtained, he
distinguished them chiefly by their physical characters, which in many cases are very
fallacious. It is possible, however, that different specimens of the resin may contain
the several resins in different proportions.
