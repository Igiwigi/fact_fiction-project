It is worth noting that the generating function can also be written as an integral,

1/4 1 x
F(q,n)= Al dx,/n+=-â€”,, (2.10)
D Jay 2 4b


where qo = 2b,/n + 3 In fact, this is the same generating function as the one for the canonical
transformation from position and momentum to action angle variables, showing that the
quadrature states |q) are formally equivalent to the position and |p) to the momentum of a particle
in a harmonic potential.

As a generating function of a canonical transformation, the derivatives of F(q,1) satisfy
