Most relevant
for the later discussion of Higgs searches at this accelerator was its Run II period (2001-2011),
during which proton-antiproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV were recorded
by the two experiments CDF and D@. The spectrum of physics processes studied at a hadron
collider such as the Tevatron or the LHC is much richer and more complicated than an ete~
machine. In fact, space constraints prevent a discussion of the Tevatron physics programme here. However, just to mention one of the interesting processes, with some resemblance to those at
LEP, Z bosons can also be produced in proton-antiproton collisions and subsequently decay
to, for example, lepton-antilepton pairs. However, in contrast to LEP, here the Z boson can be
accompanied by one or more hadronic jets from initial- or final-state gluon radiation, as well by
further hadronic activity due to the so-called underlying event.
