Because with a lower
charge at the metal the core-excited state would be less well screened, the energy required to
perform the core to valence excitation in XAS would be higher. Accordingly, the absorption energy
would be higher for higher oxidation states. This is an interpretation that in principle could apply
and has in fact been applied to both K-edge and L-edge XAS of 3d transition-metal systems. Indeed, it is well established that the K-edge XAS energies [9,47,88] and the L-edge XAS energies
[88,89] increase with increasing metal oxidation state (there are many more equivalently suited
examples for this than in the references given here). Owing to the difficulties in disentangling geometric and electronic structure effects in K-edge
XAS, it is favourable to use L-edge XAS to directly probe the metal oxidation state with direct
probing of the 3d-derived molecular orbitals via the strong dipole-allowed 2p â€” 3d transitions.
