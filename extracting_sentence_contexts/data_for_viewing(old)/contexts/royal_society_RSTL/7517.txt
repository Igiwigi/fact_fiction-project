672 MR. CHARLES TOMLINSON ON SUPERSATURATED SALINE SOLUTIONS,

Potassic chlorate, potassic ferrocyanide, baric nitrate, and plumbic nitrate gave 8imilar

results.

Ammonium-nitrate solution gave apparently some signs of supersaturation ; but the
observation is liable to error from the fact that at high temperatures ammonia is given
off. According to KARSTEN, 100 parts of water at 645 F. dissolve 199-54 parts of the
salt. A hot solution (2 salt to 1 water) was filtered into a clean flask moistened with
a few drops of tig. ammon. Such a solution remained during an hour or 0 at 40, when
it 8uddenly crystallized. I may, however, remark that a number of authorities differ in
their determination of the s0lubility of this salt. But if the observation be correct, the
behaviour of this anhydrous salt resembles that of s8ome salts that crystallize with only
a small proportion of water of crystallization. Baric chloride (Ba Cl+2 Aq)is a case in
point. According to BRANDE'S Table, 100 parts water at 995 F, dissolve 51 parts of
the salt. This is equal to 244 grains of salt to one ounce of water. A solution of this
kind cooled from the boiling-point to 100* without depositing salt, and it was not until
the temperature had fallen to about 66* that the salt separated, and then it did 89
abundantly.
