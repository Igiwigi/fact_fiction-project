pital bones are flattened out, while the parietals are forcibly bent ; there is no original
tendency of the flattened central parts of the frontal and occipital bones to become ele-
vated, and the natural tendency of the parietals to become flatter is insufficient to undo
the enormous bending to which they have been subjected ; while, in addition, the direc-

S tions of the planes of marginal growth are entirely changed.

5 V. COMPARISON OF THE HUMAN SKULL WITH THE SKULLS OF VARIOUS ANIMALS.

= On comparing the human skull with that of the Chimpanzee or Orang, the most inter-
5 esting points noticeable in the latter, in connexion with the facts brought forward in this
E: paper, are the smallness of the cranial curyature, and the length of the base as compared
E with that of the arch. There is also a complete absence of balance of the head on the
= vertebral column, which is in harmony with the fact that no Ape is capable of supporting
b= itself by balance on its hind limbs, but requires persistent muscular action to preyent it
E . from falling.

D To compare the human cranium properly with crania of animals, the cranial cavity
S must be regarded as a dilated and curyed continuation of the spinal canal. The adyance
V in the form of the cranial cavity of Man, as compared with that of the Chimpanzee,
= conists in increased dilatation both in height and breadth and in increased curvature,
© whereby not only is the vault expanded, but the bones of the base are crowded together,
= the postsphenoid and presphenoid being fused, the ethmoid depressed, and the yomer
