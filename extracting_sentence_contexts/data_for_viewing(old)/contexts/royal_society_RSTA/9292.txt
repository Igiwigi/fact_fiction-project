GRAVITATION AS AFFECTED BY TEMPERATURE. 861

One peculiarity of this form of suspension is that it never of itself comes to rest.
For when the beam touches one tube at the end of a swing, it receives, by the tremors
in the apparatus, enough energy to send it to the other end of its swing. This
perpetual motion was counteracted by an arrestment (shown in the left side tube)
worked by a magnet outside the vacuum. By this device the system was brought
under control.

This form of apparatus was abandoned on account of an unexpected form of
attraction which caused the masses, m, m, to rush to the walls of the vacuum vessel
and cling there indefinitely. These forces are very strong and existed despite the fact
that there was a complete “ earthed” system of aluminium tubing lining the vacuum
vessel and that the suspension was “earthed.” After separate investigation this effect
was attributed to radiometric-pressure, which cannot be avoided in this form of vacuum
vessel.

In the final form of apparatus, to be next described, there are two distinct sets :
(a) where the attracting masses are cylindrical; (b) where these are spherical.
But as the latter ss is more important, the following description applies to it
‘ throughout.
