since been applied to the detection of special nuclear materials [15], used to image nuclear reactors
[16,17] and spent nuclear fuel [18,19].

The method is based on the fact that muons, when travelling through materials, undergo many
individual Coulomb scatterings with the charged atomic nuclei. As a result, they deviate from
their initial trajectory and exit the material at an angle with respect to their initial trajectory.

The theory of multiple Coulomb scattering, developed by Moliere and Bethe [20-22], predicts,
for the muons that go through an object, a Gaussian polar angle distribution with tails. The
dominant part of such a distribution can be described by:

where @ is the polar angle and 09 is given by
