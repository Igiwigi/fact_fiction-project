greater or less than the mean of those got from
the other experiments, the above conversion of the quadratic into the simple equation
would not have been admissible, It will be seen eventually, however, that the
conversion is legitimate, and the value of p at a temperature! of 9997 C. as deter-
mined from the simple equation is

Mathematical Formule required for the Effect of the Rotation of the Spheres or
Cylinders about their own Azes.t

Professor G. G. SToKEs has been good enough to furnish me with the following
formulze for the corrections not yet made for the effect of the rotation of the spheres
or cylinders about their own axes ;—

Let A, be the logarithmic decrement due to the rotation, then for the spheres
