The
-Bnore solid part, the mercurous sulphate, settles to the bottom, resting on the mercury,
and a clear liquid remains on the top. The zinc rods used varied somewhat in length ;
a some cells they were entirely in the clear liquid, in others they extended partly
into the more solid portion below. Various observations had shown us that this
Snight produce some difference in the behaviour of the cell.
q The differences appear to arise from the fact that when the zinc rod touches the
anercurous sulphate it becomes properly amalgamated. A small trace of iron in the
Zine, or in the zine sulphate solution, does not, then, produce any serious effect. the
owever, the zinc is only in the clear liquid, the amalgamation does not always take
lace. The zine, instead, frequently becomes covered with a grey deposit.
