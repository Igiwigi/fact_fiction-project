organ is entire.

The muscular fibres of the stomach therefore are stimulated by its contents,
in the same way as those of the heart by the blood, the usual action of both
being wholly independent of the nervous system, an inference confirmed by
many other experiments beside those here referred to.

I have, as appears from the papers which the Society have done me the
honour to publish, attempted to go a step further, and to show experimentally
that the office of the nervous power in preparing the gastric juice, may be cor-
rectly imitated by exposing the living stomach to the influence of a voltaic
pile after the supply of neryous power is interrupted. ' Those who were at first
inclined to doubt this fact, have since publicly acknowledged, on witnessing
the experiments, that the. digestive process of the stomach supported- by gal-
vanism, is, as far as we can see, as perfect as that supported by: the nervous
power itself.

It is therefore evident that-in the formation of the gastric juice, a chemical
power can Ã¾e substituted for that of the neryous system. I do not mean that,
srrictly speaking, its formation is to be regarded as a mere chemical process,

because it is only in a living stomach that galvanism can have such an effect ;
