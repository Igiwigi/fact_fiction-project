In the present stage of excavation the deposit as exposed extends east and west over
a length of some 175 metres; north and south, at its eastern end, over a breadth of
50 or more metres ; while in height opposite the Lower Fissure it rises some 50 metres,
fig. 30. Only on its north side can the approximate limits of the whole deposit be
gauged at present with any degree of certainty, though even here its lower limit has not
yet been reached. On the other hand, in spite of the deceptive appearance presented
by a septum-like mass of fallen limestone in the upper part of the deposit, Layer 3,
fig. 30, it is perfectly clear that the original top of the formation has been destroyed by
past erosion, for the cave deposits without doubt extend above what had earlier been
alluded to as the “collapsed roof” (TxruHaRD and Youne, 1930), and attain
to the actual present surface of the hillside above. A striking indication that the
Choukoutien fissures have been strongly eroded since the complete formation of their
contained deposits is afforded by the fact that a layer of extremely hard travertine,
1 metre in thickness capping the very summit of the hill just to the south of the Main
Deposit of Locality 1, is full of the bones of Chiroptera, fig. 30 and Plate 6. A whole
superstructure of dissected limestone, now no longer existing, must at one time have
existed in this place in the past, in order to explain the presence here in such a situation
of this stalagmitic Chiroptera-bearing mass.

In view of these observations it is evident that even in that part which has been pre-
served the original shape and extent of Locality 1 cannot yet completely be defined.
Nevertheless, it has become customary in the field to distinguish by special terms the
three following different regions of the deposit, fig. 29 :—

The Main Deposit, forming the most central and extensive part of the exposed beds.
