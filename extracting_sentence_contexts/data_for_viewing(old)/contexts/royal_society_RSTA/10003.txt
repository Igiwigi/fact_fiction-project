degree is dE/d0 = —3p.8, = $x 2°73x10"x2'8x10' ergs. This gives dE/d0 = 2:7
calories, which is about three times the heat required to raise the temperature ot
1 cub. centim. of platinum one degree at high temperatures.

It is possible that the number of free electrons per cubic centimetre is greater close
to the surface of the platinum than inside. The value of p, deduced from the
negative leak is, of course, the value close to the surface. Another very possible
explanation of the difficulty is that D and p, have been over-estimated. If D is
taken ten times smaller, or 1°44 x 10°, the energy required per cubic centimetre is only
0°27 calories per cubic centimetre, which is about one-third of the heat capacity per
cubic centimetre. This value of D makes the thickness of the double layer
2x 107* centim. instead of 2°6x 10~%, and with it Q’ log (D/A) is nearly as constant
as with the value used. In fact, the possible error in D is at least a factor of 10, so
that the difficulty about the specific heat is not very serious in the case of platinum
if the value of p,, deduced from the negative leak, is taken.

10. Conclusion.

The view taken in the above paper is that the effect of the hydrogen on the
negative leak is due to its presence in the surface layer of the platinum. To explain
this it is supposed that the hydrogen atoms are positively charged, so that they
diminish the charge per unit area in the electrical double layer covering the surface
of the platinum. The hydrogen appears to dissolve in the platinum at first, but at
high pressures in time forms a stable combination, having a very small dissociation
pressure. With new wires, before the stable compound has been formed, the leak is
