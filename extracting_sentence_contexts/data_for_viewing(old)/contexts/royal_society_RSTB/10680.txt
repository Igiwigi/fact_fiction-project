In May and June of 2005, one of the new variants of H5N1
killed more than 5000 wild bar-headed geese, gulls and ducks
in Qinghai Lake, in China. Before they died, the affected birds
developed neurological problems [58]. Researchers worried
that migratory birds would carry the virus to India, Europe,
the Middle East and Africa. This has since happened; but
to what extent the world trade in poultry, both official and
unofficial, might also be responsible remains an open question.

What is certain, however, is that a highly contagious strain
of H5N1 can now be reached in only a few mutations. Such a
strain could allow airborne transmission between mammals
and in this way trigger a major pandemic. In fact such a
strain already exists, thanks to laboratory scientists at University
of Wisconsin-Madison who recently created a deadly variant of
the influenza virus able to outsmart the human immune system
[59]. The somewhat nebulous justification for this work is that it
enables laboratory researchers to better understand such
viruses and how to attack them. Stephen King in his 1978
horror/fantasy novel ‘The Stand’ envisioned the global apoca-
lypse that would ensue were such a virus to escape from the
laboratory. Many of us hope it will not come to that.
