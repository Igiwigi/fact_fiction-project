Further data are required to decide whether taking-off would
occur in this way, as a relief from excessive buffeting. The optomotor theory of behaviour in wind. While there is no evidence that flying locusts do,
in fact, respond directly to the wind, there is good evidence that other insects make visual
compensatory responses to the apparent movement of the fixed background, a movement
due to their being carried over that background by the wind. The use of fixed visible
features for wind orientation has been suggested for many insects, and demonstrated in the
laboratory for mosquitoes (Kennedy 1940). It would, on the whole, be more surprising if
locusts did not respond indirectly to wind in a similar way than if they did.
