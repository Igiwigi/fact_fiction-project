value the drag increased at a greater rate than the velocity. The change was attributed
to a change from steady to turbulent motion. RayLeicu’s theory of stability of an
inviscid fluid for symmetrical disturbances makes the case when the inner cylinder is
fixed stable at all speeds.

MALLOCK’s experiments yielded the same result as Covrrrn’s, but in this case the
value of REYNOLD’s criterion was higher than that obtained by Courrre.§

MALLocK extended his experiments to cover the case in which the inner cylinder
rotated and the outer one was at rest. In this case he found instability at all speeds of
the inner cylinder. This result is in accordance with Lord Rayiereu’s theoretical
prediction for the case of an inviscid fluid, but on the other hand it seems certain, in
fact Lord Rayiereui| has proved, that at very low speeds all steady motions of a viscous
fluid must be stable.

In spite of these differences between theory and experiment there is one point in
which RayLErGu’s “ inviscid fluid ” theory is in agreement with MaLLock’s experiments,
namely, the large difference in regard to stability between the cases when the inner
and when the outer cylinder is fixed. This shows clearly that in the case when the
outer cylinder is fixed at any rate, the disturbance is not two-dimensional in character.
Whether it is actually of a symmetrical type as contemplated by RAYLEIGH, or whether
it is of some other three-dimensional form, remains to be seen.
