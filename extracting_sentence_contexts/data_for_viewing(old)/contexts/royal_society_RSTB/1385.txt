inted with what appears to be a very small amount of the melanie pigment, which
account for the brown, as distinct from yellow, colour of the wings.

But it is in certain members of the group usually described under the name
eracolus, that the greatest departure from the normal pigmentation of Pierids
ecurs. The orange “tips” which are common on the upper wings of this group may
be replaced by a brilliant red, in which the pigment I have described in Delias
undoubtedly is present. But the red may take a bluer shade, and finally, in such
ies as 7. imperator (Burt.), T. coliagenes (Burt.), and others, one finds a very
ing development of colour strongly suggesting the effect of aniline dyes of the
agenta type. On extracting these brilliant colour patches with hot water, however,

e wing being due to a superadded interference effect caused by certain finely
riated delicate scales, which, in the extracted wing, may be seen mingled with the
ordinary scaies which have contained pigment. In making this observation, 1 have

upply of which I was indebted to Mr. Grose-Smrru. I have also employed speci-
nens of Imperator obtained from the same source.

The scale-pigments of the Pieride are thus few in number, closely related, and
sily identified. I have never found a coloured patch on any single species which
ould not yield a yellow solution to hot water, nor one from which the murexide and
lepidoporphyrin tests could not be obtained.
