distribution of the radiation in the spectrum, we have to use the luminosity curve, that
is the curve which gives the relative brightness of the different parts of the spectrum
considered as light. Now the shape of the normal luminosity curve varies with the
intensity of the spectrum; the curve obtained with a bright spectrum when the cones
are principally, if not exclusively, functionary, differs markedly from that obtained
with a very feeble spectrum when the rods are alone operative. In the case of
threshold vision we have to do with rod vision except in the red and for the foveal
values obtained by observers of class I., and hence the luminosity curve to be employed
to give the relative brightness of the different parts of the spectrum is that obtained
at extremely low intensities or at any rate where the rods are alone operative. Such
a curve can be obtained by a person having normal colour vision by the use of a very
feeble spectrum but the observations are very difficult. Hence it is better to make
use of the fact that the luminosity curve of a person who has monochromatic colour
vision corresponds to rod vision only. One of us has determined the luminosity curves
of three monochromats and we have taken the mean of the three as giving the rod
luminosity curve. The observations were taken with the arc as a source of light but
by means of the energy curves given in fig. 3 we have calculated the corresponding
curve for the Nernst light. The values both for the are and for the Nernst as light
sources are given in Table IV.
