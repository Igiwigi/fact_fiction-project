If we can observe a rotation of one minute, we are in a position
to detect a retardation of X/10800. If 7 be the thickness traversed, v and Â»+8v
the two velocities of propagation, the relative retardation is I 8v/v. To take an
example, suppose that 1=20 inches, X= 5gSggth inch ; 80 that if 8v/v exceed 1073,
the fact might be detected.* It appears therefore that we are able to observe
extraordinarily minute relative differences in the velocities of propagation of the two
circularly polarised rays.
