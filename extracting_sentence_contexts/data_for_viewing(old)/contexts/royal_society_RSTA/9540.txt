with calctum by sublimation in a vacuum; an excess of oxygen was let into the
discharge tube and the calcium was oxidised to lime. No detectable ionisation
occurred during this process of oxidation in the cold, nor’even at a temperature of
500° C. or 600° C., under which conditions the oxidation must have been very rapid.
It was only when the lime formed had been raised to 700°C. or 800°C. that a
measurable electron emission was obtained. In the case of the strongly electro-
positive alkali metals it is not impossible that an electron emission (as a result of
thermal energy) occurs at the ordinary temperature of the laboratory, and if an
increased emission does occur in the presence of a reacting gas, this may be due, not
directly to the chemical action, but to the rise of temperature which accompanies it.
This momentary increase of temperature may be very considerable in the case of the
surface layer, although the rise in temperature of the bulk of the metal may be quite
inappreciable. The fact that chemical action and rise of temperature are usually
closely associated in the type of reaction with which we are concerned makes
it very difficult to prove that an observed thermionic emission is a result of either
chemical action or temperature alone.

A process which causes the liberation of electrons from matter must act either by
increasing the kinetic energy of the electrons or by diminishing the work which
an electron must do in order to escape. An increase of temperature acts in the
former manner, but a disturbance of the motions of some of the electrons would also
