A straightforward calculation shows that
(8) = a,j; — 0:0) F
=K,e7 8/2)ty_ lag, 34, — (a; — 8; _ —b-(Vo, — KV 411
=Ke [-zAg1 — ko + 5 Ako — (aij — 5i)(G1 — Ko) (Vo, — mV). (4.11)

Note that the first and the second terms in the square brackets on the right-hand side of (4.11) are
negative, while the fourth and the fifth terms are small, being of order e. If x is close to I”, then the
second term dominates the third term and if x is away from the boundary /”, then one can choose
«2 > 0 so that the first term dominates the third term. Thereby we use the fact that both g; and y
vanish at I”, they are both non-negative (by the maximum principle), and both satisfy the Hopf
lemma (since they are both supersolutions). It follows, then, that there exists a «2 > 0 and some
constant C; such that

(1 = aijdjj — b;9;)F < —Cyx e 8, (4.12)
It then follows from (4.12) and (3.2) that
(At = aij — bi9;)(—4r — F) > —(ragquij +Orbiqi + BANG, w! + Akqa w}) + Cree C2, (4.13)

Note, however, that the term in parentheses on the right-hand side above is a quadratic
nonlinearity and as such decays at least as fast as e~*!:

Now, using (4.13) and the above bound, we note that by choosing the constant «1 detcy/ Ci)cie,
we have that

(81 — aij — b;9;)(—qu — F) > Cocre eG — Cocye oF! > 0,

since B =24 —n> Ba. The previous bound implies that —q—F is a supersolution for the
operator 0; — 49; — bj0;.
