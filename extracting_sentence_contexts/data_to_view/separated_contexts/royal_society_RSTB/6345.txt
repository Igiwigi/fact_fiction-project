* On the other hand, in
the nearly related fox, as described by Rowtanps and Parkes (1936), there is a
single annual oestrous cycle, reproduction taking place in the early part of the year. Tue Gonaps

Before passing on to the consideration of the stimuli which probably act through
the intermediation of the nervous system—and this I propose to do in some detail—
it is desirable to state briefly the main known facts concerning the part played by the
internal organs in regulating sexual and reproductive rhythm. That the gonads
are essential organs in these periodic processes has presumably been recognized ever
since castration was first practised. Thus, it is well known that if these organs are
removed prior to maturity the sexual cycle never begins, or if this is done after maturity
has been reached the cycle stops.
