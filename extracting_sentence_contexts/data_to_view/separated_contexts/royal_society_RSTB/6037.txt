Both convey numerous
trigeminal contributions. In addition, fibres pass directly to the cerebellum from
the entering trigeminal root, fig. 13, while others reach it via the brachium
conjunctivum. The trigeminal nerve thus enters very largely into the formation
of the cerebellumâ€”a fact which Hines has noted for Ornithorhynchus. Ventral
spino-cerebellar fibres reach the cerebellum along the brachium conjunctivum, and
tecto-cerebellar fibres from the superior and inferior colliculi through the anterior
medullary velum. The outstanding features of the cerebellum of Echidna are the enormous hyper-
trophy of the lobus anterius and the paraflocculi, and the small size of the lobus
medius.
