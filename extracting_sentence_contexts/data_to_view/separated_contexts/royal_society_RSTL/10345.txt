MASTERS,

by external conditions. Referring the reader to his paper* for full details, it,
here be stated on his authority, that the hard woody fibres beneath the epidermis of
the leaves of grasses—** the hypodermic fibres ”—which form a protecting sheath to
the fibrovascular bundles of which they are indeed a dependence, and which mugt
greatly contribute to the rigidity of the leaf, are fostered in their growth in hot dry
Situations. Shade and moisture, on the contrary, are not favourable to their development,

It is easy to see the bearing of these facts on the question of the struggle for existence. Speaking of the cellular or parenchymatous structure of the leaves of grasses the game
botanist remarks that there are, speaking generally, three categories of cells : 1, those
with green chlorophyll; 2, colorless cells without chlorophyll ; 3, stelliform cells. The
green cells predominate in grasses growing in cool shady localities ; the colorless cells
are relatively abundant in species growing on sandy sea-coasts ; while the stelliform
cells are especially abundant in aquatic species,

Flowers, &c.—Tt forms no part of our purpose to describe in detail the inflorescence
or the floral structure of snch well known plants as those which constitute the mixed
herbage of the plots.
