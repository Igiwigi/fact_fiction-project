the broken one) referring to the extraordinary magneto-ionic component, and the other
to the ordinary magneto-ionic component. Instead of regarding (6) as a quadratic for
q’, let us regard it as a quartic for g. There are then two pairs of equal and opposite roots,
which, when plotted against N for fixed values of H° and /, give four curves JA, RA, IB,
RB which fit together symmetrically as shown in fig. 6. The broken and continuous
curves in fig. 6 correspond to those in fig. 5. JA refers to the upgoing extraordinary wave,
AR to the downcoming extraordinary wave, JB to the upgoing ordinary wave and BR
to the downcoming ordinary wave. At A the pair of roots corresponding to the extra-
ordinary wave passes from real to conjugate complex values via equality as N increases
through N,. N, is the critical electron density which has to be attained in the ionosphere
in order to produce reflexion of the extraordinary wave. Corresponding remarks apply
to the ordinary wave. The symmetry of the curves in fig. 6 about the N-axis expresses the
fact that the quartic (6) for q is actually a quadratic for q°.

Tf we now take the full wave-function (4) and substitute it into the electromagnetic
equations as in the case when # = 0, we again obtain a quartic equation for g, which,
however, is no longer simply a quadratic for q?: as we shall see explicitly in § 7, the equation
is of the form
