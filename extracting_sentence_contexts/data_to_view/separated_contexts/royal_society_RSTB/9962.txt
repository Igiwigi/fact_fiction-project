How-
ever, morphological and genetic research since the late 1980s established that all
humans are more closely related to each other than to any Late Quaternary hominin
group. This showed that humans share an ancestor who lived after other hominin
lineages had diverged [3-8], confirmed through palaeogenomic studies [9,10]. These and subsequent studies have also shown that the people of Africa are more
diverse than all other human populations [11], and together with the fact that the
earliest anatomically modern human fossils are found in Ethiopia [12-14], point
to sub-Saharan Africa as the place of origin of the species around 200000 years
ago (200 ka), consistent with genetic results [15].
