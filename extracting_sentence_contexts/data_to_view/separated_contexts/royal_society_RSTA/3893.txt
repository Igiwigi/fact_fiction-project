A value of 1 implies that all losses are due to predation : 3S
or grazing, while a value of 0 implies that group i is never consumed and all its mass losses are 12
due to natural processes unrelated to predation. Therefore, the expression (1 â€” EE;) refers to the nee)
fraction of the production of group i lost to natural mortality due to causes other than predation :
(old age, disease, etc.). a]
For the sake of simplicity, we assumed E;=0 and Y;=0 for all functional groups. The DN
assumption that E; =0 can be justified by the fact that the area of the Southern Ocean is vastly iG
greater than its perimeter (i.e. the length of the Antarctic Polar Front) and hence migration most [3S
likely has little effect on biomass on an oceanic scale. In addition, the difference in physical .
conditions between Antarctic and subantarctic waters probably prevents the former from acting
as a net biomass source or sink. The assumption that Y;=0 for all groups, while not strictly
correct, is a defensible approximation given that, on an oceanic scale, current fisheries remove
far less biomass than predators for all target groups (small mysticetes, krill and large demersal
fish) and no Antarctic fisheries existed in 1900.
