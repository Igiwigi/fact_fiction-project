'= h/87*I’ the term h/82*I’ — aw, and instead
of h/8r*1’” the term h/8721"’ — ay. To a first approximation we may regard the correc-
tion as linear, and write a, = «'n’ and a,,=«'’n’. In Table IX these facts are illus-
trated : A” diminishes as n” increases and A’ diminishes as n’ increases. Approximately
I have estimated «’=0:03, «” =0-025. As a consequence, C = A’— A” =
(h/8r21’ — h/8221") — (0-03n’ — 0-025") shows a decrease as 7’ increases, an increase
as n” increases, and a slight decrease as we travel along a sequence An = a constant.
