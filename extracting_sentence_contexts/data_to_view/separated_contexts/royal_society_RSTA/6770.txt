FOX AND R. V. SOUTHWELL ON RELAXATION

including the ‘biharmonic equation’
Viw =0 (4)

as a special case. (V? again stands for the operator 0?/Ax?+0?/dy?, and W, like Z, is a
specified function of x and y.) The main difficulty of the new problem lies in the fact
that a double boundary condition is now imposed on w: when V2w is specified at the
boundary, equation (3) or (4) can be integrated in two separate steps, each involving
the solution of (1) or (2); but such separation is not possible when both w and dw/dv
have to take specified values at the boundary, and in some problems still less tractable
boundary conditions are presented. Orthodox methods then seek a solution in the form
of an infinite series, each term of which severally satisfies one but not both of the two
conditions (Love 1928 a, b). Though formally satisfactory, a solution of this kind requires
much laborious computation before it can be utilized in engineering design, and in
stress analysis (for example) calculation is usually discarded in favour of experimental
methods depending on the photo-elastic effect, notwithstanding that much labour is
entailed both in the making of the necessary measurements and in their subsequent
reduction.
