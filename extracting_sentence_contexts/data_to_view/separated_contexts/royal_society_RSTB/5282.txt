The tracheids constituting the antennz and the
central bar, on the other hand, consist of immature, relatively thin-walled elements,
so that differentiation was evidently from without inwards (Plate 10, fig. 31), a feature
which Scorr (38) has shown to be characteristic of Botrychioxylon also. The cortex consists of homogeneous parenchyma, the cells of which are arranged in
radial series, and a companion section (Slide No. K606s, U.C.L.) reveals the fact that
these cells are still meristematic and form small spindle-shaped groups, the ends of which

dovetail into one another (text-fig. 28). The epidermis

itself consists of small regular cells, but is remarkable for if

the development of large numbers of hairs of a most
peculiar and specialised type. Those present in the Kidston
slides (text-fig. 29) are smaller and less highly differentiated
than those of the University College specimens (text-fig. 30),
but in both the hairs consist of a long finger-shaped multi-
cellular lower portion, the apex of which bears a stout
pointed portion consisting for the greater part of its length
of a single row of large cells.
