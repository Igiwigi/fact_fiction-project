Nevertheless, as the workshop on ‘Machine learning in weather
and climate’ (Oxford, September 2019) has also shown, there are still reservations about DL in
this community. Two core arguments in this regard are the lack of explainability of deep NNs
and the lack of physical constraints. Furthermore, some scepticism prevails due to the fact that
researchers have experimented with rather simple NNs which were clearly unsuited to capture
the complexity of meteorological data and feedback processes, but then extrapolate these results
to discredit any NN application including the much more powerful DL systems. In their review
of ‘Deep learning and process understanding for data-driven Earth system science’, Reichstein
et al. [14] argue that traditional ML approaches might not be optimally suited to address the
specific data challenges posed by Earth system data. They suggest that ‘deep learning methods
are needed to cope with complex statistics, multiple outputs, different noise sources and high-
dimensional spaces [of Earth system data].
