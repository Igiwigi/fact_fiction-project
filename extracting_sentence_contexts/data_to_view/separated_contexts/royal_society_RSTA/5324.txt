Figure 1 shows examples of the extracted supports of the SWT
curves corresponding to the ECG and respiration first harmonics. The advantage of using SWT for phase and frequency extraction over the more commonly
used marked events (MEs) method is that one obtains phase and frequency values at the same
sampling frequency as the signal, whereas the ME method gives values only at particular points
(e.g. peaks). Thus, the effective sampling frequency of the characteristics extracted by MEs is,
in fact, the (time-varying) frequency at which the MEs occur, i.e. the reciprocal of the current
interpeak interval (usually around 1 Hz for ECG and 0.25 Hz for respiration); all other values,
obtained by interpolation to match the original sampling frequency, are unphysical. Note that heart activity is sometimes modelled through use of the integral pulse frequency
modulation (IPFM) model [42] which, in effect, assumes that only the R-peak positions in the ECG
are informative. Within this framework, much effort has been directed towards the reconstruction
of instantaneous heart frequency (IHF), treated as the input signal.
