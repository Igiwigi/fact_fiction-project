It is now a period of five years since we entered upon the
present investigation, continuing it during the breeding seasons
of these two species of bivalves. Having at last brought our
labours to a 'satisfactory conclusion, I shall now detail the
observations we have made. The singular fact of pearls having their origin in the abor-
tive ova of these 'bivalves; has been already recorded in the
Philosophical Transactions. Before that discovery was made,
a pearl was imagined to be'the nacral- covering which the
animal has a power of-'secreting upon any extraneous body,
introduced by accident, or otherwise, between the shells, to
render its surface equally smooth and-polished with-the $hell

itself, and thus prevent it from injuring the substance of the
animal in contact with it. In the HuxTERIAn collection there are many specimens, in
which extraneous bodies of different kinds have been intro-
duced within the shells, through holes bored for that purpose,
while the animal was alive; which in the course of time
received an external coat of nacre, and bear a general resem-
blance to the pearl; some of these were glass beads, some
leaden shot ; but the lustre of the pearl cannot, I believe, be
imitated, since it is produced by the bright internal surface
of the central cell shining through the semitransparent coats
which are afterwards formed upon it.
