menstruation.

Thus out of the seventeen menstruating females, in one case only was a recently
discharged follicle found, and in that case only is it possible to say that ovulation and
menstruation were coincident. I do not myself think that we are justified in assert-
ing, even in this case, that ovulation and menstruation are coincident ; of this point I
say more below, but we are undoubtedly justified in saying, that in no other of the
cases before us is there any possibility of asserting that these two processes are coin-
cident.

The presence of ripe Graafian follicles was also looked for, and in one specimen n only
was a follicle found which could possibly be thought to be ripe. It was enlarged and
somewhat prominent, but it appears to me impossible to be assured that it was in fact
a ripe follicle, ready to discharge the ovum it contained. â€˜he female in which this
was found was undergoing Stage V. of menstruation.

Passing now to a histological examination of a series of discharged follicles, a
glance at the figs. 5 to 9 (Plate 1) will show the various stages which the discharged
follicle passes through, on its way towards complete disappearance and amalgamation
with the ovarian stroma tissue.

The first point which strikes one is the difference in the size of these discharged
follicles. They are all drawn with the aid of a camera lucida, with the same object
glass and eye-piece,
