of 9:4 millims. from 30° to 39° C., a second contraction from 41° to 50° C., and a relaxation
from 52° to 55° C.

overcome the slight tensions we have employed in our experiments. We have
invariably found that when the first contraction is well marked the later ones are
only slightly shown or even absent altogether, unless the tension acting on the muscle
has been sufficient to produce an elongation after the first contraction has ceased.
That the first mentioned is the chief cause of the small amount of these later con-
tractions is proved by the fact that when the first contraction does not occur, a
condition which, as we shall see, may be brought about in two ways, the later
contractions then produce a marked effect (see figs. 7 and 9).

There is yet another condition, set up by the first contraction, which modifies the

appearance of the later ones, namely, an increase in the extensibility caused by the
proteid coagulation. This change has already been recorded by GorscHiicu and
