The number of turns was determined by a counter attached to the mandrel
the lathe. In addition, after winding each layer a piece of thin paper was laid
it, and by drawing a pencil along a line parallel to the axis of the coil a permar
record was obtained of the number of turns in the layer. These records se
to check the readings of the counter,
The circumference over each layer was measured in three places by a steel taj
and corrections were applied for the thickness of the tape, and the fact that dur
a measurement the tape formed a helix, the pitch of which was equal to the bre
of the tape. . At the end of each alternate layer the resistance of the wire in each circuit, p
of which was on one of the wooden reels and the rest on the gun-metal reel,
determined in order to ascertain if any short-circuiting had occurred. RO ATION OF THE PLANE OF POLARIZATION OF LIGHT IN LIQUIDS. 625
