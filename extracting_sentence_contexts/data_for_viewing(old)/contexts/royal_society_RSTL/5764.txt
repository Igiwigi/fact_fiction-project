pended between the two poles in such a manner
that its axis « becomes vertical and therefore its
base A horizontal, sets with energy x axially
(fig. 1). This axis z remains similarly directed
even when we reduce the original prism to a plate,
by taking away its obtuse edges. Such a plate
appears to be repelled by the two poles like a dia-
magnetic body, while a plate cut out of the same
prism by grinding down its acute edges will be
directed, the mode of suspension remaining the
same, like a paramagnetic body, as in fact it is.

The same prism, suspended in such a manner that Fig. 2. |
its axis « may oscillate between the two poles in the
horizontal plane, points equatorially, and s8eems to be |
repelled by the poles like a diamagnetic body. We
can use in this experiment any natural prism with its ; |
summits, whose longest dimension is five or six times $346
greater than its thickness; we may use also a s8mall 11A £ |
needle twenty or thirty times as long as it is thick. os |
Tn all these cases the oscillating salt finds its position of stable equilibrium by setting
itself equatorially. When we reduce the oscillating prism to a plate, by diminishing *
the dimension of its axis, such a plate, the axis « remaining horizontal, will point |
