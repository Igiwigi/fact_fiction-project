INTRODUCTION.

Tn an earlier paper on the subject of pleochroic haloes* it was pointed out that
several features of the halo derived from the uranium family of radioactive elements
were not easily accounted for. This fact led me to undertake a more careful study of
haloes. But, although many observations and measurements were made, until recently
my attempts at obtaining solution of the difficulties were too crude to merit
publication. They were more especially hampered by the scarcity of haloes derived
from the thorium family of elements. I could find out nothing as to the mode of
origin of these haloes, and, on the observations available, it even appeared as if there
were some unaccountable difference in the course of development of the haloes derived
from the uranium and the thorium families. The initial stages of development
seemed to be entirely absent in the case of the thorium series. This was not
satisfactory. A few months ago, however, I found in a Vosges granite, a mica which
was rich in thorium haloes, Some of these haloes appeared in the earlier stages of
development ; stages corresponding to the earliest in the development of the uranium
halo. This find showed that the same course was followed in the genesis of both
