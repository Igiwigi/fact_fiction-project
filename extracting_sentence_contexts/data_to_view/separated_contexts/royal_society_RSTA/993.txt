At higher strains, the viscoelastic response of the magnetic gels was
predominantly determined by the resilience of the polymerâ€”particle network, and the magnetic
forces lost their influence because of the large gap between the particles. The rod-like shape of the composite particles plays a central role in conditioning the intensity
of the MR effect. In fact, we used a parameter for the quantification of the MR effect that only
takes into account the particle shape (normalizing by the saturation magnetization, the applied
field and the particle volume fraction). Using this parameter, such effect in ferrogels with rod-
like particles (64%) becomes considerably larger than those reached in ferrogels with spherical
microparticles (11-15%). Data accessibility.
