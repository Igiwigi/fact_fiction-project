Krannera marginata (Henr).
Carpolithus sp.

Fossilis incerte sedis.

Fasciculites groenlandicus Herr.

The following Table includes species collected by Mr. Honrrum and myself in 1921,
and some of HErER’s species which I have examined. Herr’s records are given only for
species which I have seen at Copenhagen or Stockholm.

Under Upernivik Island are included all the places where we obtained specimens :
such observations as we made did not enable us to discover any facts in favour of a
geological separation of the plant-bearing beds. Heer allocates all the plants from
Upernivik Island to his Atane, or middle, series.

The plant beds on the North coast of the Nigssuak peninsula are assigned by HEER
to his Kome series, the lowest member of his Greenland group. I have not drawn a
distinction in the Table between the different localities where plants were collected at
Angiarsuit. In the Patoot series Heer includes the bulk of the beds at Patit on the
South coast of the peninsula. The plants we collected at Patit were in part found in
pieces of shale on the talus slopes or in the bed of a glacier stream, and in part in situ at
a height of about 400 metres above sea-level. Most of the plants from Atanikerdluk

were obtained from Hrxr’s “ Liriodendron’’ bed. Herr included all the Cretaceous
