In another study set in an office with poor
ventilation, an outbreak from an index case was reported in spite of the presence of plexiglass
screens between the workers [83]. This suggested that barrier devices did not provide adequate
protection against transmission in an environment with poor ventilation and long occupancy
periods. Interestingly, another study, again in an office setting, showed that certain kinds of barrier
devices might in fact lead to increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [84]. They used a CO tracer
decay method in an office which had a reported outbreak to show that the presence of screens in
the office impeded ventilation, leading to stagnation of air in certain zones.

6. Conclusion

Evidence from the literature suggests that EC NPIs of ventilation, air cleaning devices and limiting
room-occupancy may have a role in reducing transmission in specified settings.
