187. The day on which this experiment was first made (May 27, 1841) was serene
and clear, but being aware that in certain states of the atmosphere a vertical beam
of halo-light passes through the sun, which in a meridional position of that luminary
might give rise to a perceptible prolongation, both upwards and downwards (though
in fact no such prolongation was perceived at the red end), it was often repeated, and
always with the same result, on subsequent occasions, whether the sun were on or
near the meridian, or otherwise. Comparative trials, also with other yellow papers,
fully satisfied me of the cause being traceable to a peculiarity in the colouring mate-
rial, as to its reflective powers. In particular, a certain paper (No. 1055.) coloured
with the juice of Chryseis californica, whose tint was almost identical with that of the
turmeric paper, only s0omewhat brighter, was tried, and the spectrum measured on
this paper was found to terminate precisely at 440, i. e. (correcting for semidiameter)
at 40-4, the very same as if white paper had been used.

188. To test the matter yet more pointedly, a strip of turmeric paper was fixed on
the Chyyseis paper, 80 that its edge should bisect the spectrum longitudinally from
end to end, the preceding half of the sun's lengthened image being received on the
