Such a contention I cannot for a moment entertain, since it is not merely the presence
in the two groups of an amnio-embryonal vesicle that we have to account for but also
the remarkable similarity, amounting to practical identity, in the details of the develop-
ment and structure of the blastocyst in the two. That all this similarity can be

accounted for by parallelism in development I do not believe. I prefer to
regard it as the outcome of heredity and as evidence of the close genetic relationship
of the Platyrrhine and Catarrhine Pithecoids, as evidence in fact of their monophyletic
origin. (2) The extra-embryonal mesoderm and ccelom and the chorion are formed even
more precociously than in Tarsius. The extra-embryonal mesoderm (the so-called
primary mesoderm of the early human blastocyst), the homologue of that of the
Tarsioid, is laid down long before the primitive streak is differentiated and is already
fully established (along with the exoccelom and the chorion) in the earliest known
Pithecoid blastocyst (SzLENKAâ€™s Keim 8. of Nasalis larvatus).
