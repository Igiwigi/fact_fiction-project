APPENDIX. III. ON account of the discrepancy (see p. 396) between the narratives given by Dr. Hovey and in this Report,
in respect of what happened in the cellar at Orange Hill on the afternoon of May 7th, we thought
it advisable to write to Mr. F. W. Grirritus, Kingstown, to ascertain, if possible, what were the actual
facts. We are much indebted to him for making further inquiries, and sending us the following
statement :— ‘

Letter from Mr, F. W. Griffiths, Government Office, St. Vincent, December 29th, 1902. “The constable from Georgetown, who was of the first to visit Orange Hill cellar after the terrible
catastrophe, states that he counted 37 dead bodies, and that this was verified afterwards.
