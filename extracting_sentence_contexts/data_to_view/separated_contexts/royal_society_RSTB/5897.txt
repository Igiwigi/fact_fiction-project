, and if they function as comb setules on the sixth limb, it is safe to deduce that the
same series acts in a similar manner further forwards. From what I have described so far, the functioning of the limb is closely similar to
that of Chirocephalus. Food is concentrated in the median space by the more distal
filter setze, but that these are not the ultimate filters is indicated by the fact that they
are comparatively wide apart, and further that the setules do not completely span the
gaps between them. The food particles so concentrated are sucked towards the mid-
ventral groove and finally on to the filter sete of the gnathobase. From this position
they are combed off by the comb setules on the walls of the food groove on the next
forward movement of the limb, and are finally blown forwards by the spurts of water
from the inter-limb spaces at the end of the next backstroke.
