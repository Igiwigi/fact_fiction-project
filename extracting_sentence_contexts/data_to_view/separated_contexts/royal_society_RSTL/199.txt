We have seen, in the foregoing experiments, that there has
sometimes been apparently a loss of some part of the fluid,
after an alteration of the temperature ; at other times there
appeared to be no loss at all ; and sometimes there appeared
to be even more $pirit in the instrument than there was at

first. These contradictory facts may, I apprehend, be ac-
counted for in the following manner. The mechanical ope-
ration of grinding a stopper that will fit so delicate a tube, as
is here necessary, perfectly tight, must be acknowledged to be
difficult ; and should it happen to be done accurately, so that
none of the fluid is lost in one degree of temperature, it is very
doubtful whether, on exposing this instrument to a different
temperature, the expansion would be the same in both the
tube and stopper. It appears most probable, from these ex-
periments, that they actually did not expand alike, as perhaps
no two pieces of glass ever do; and the effect to be expected
from a less expansion of the stopper than of the tube is, either
that some of the fluid would leak out, or that the capacity of
the ball would be enlarged.
