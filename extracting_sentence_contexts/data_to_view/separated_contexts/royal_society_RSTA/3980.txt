Kalendarium, Regiomontanus, 1476. (Online version in colour.)

One serious contribution to the history of solar eclipses, and one that is both scientific and
artistic, is that made by the Polish Lutheran astronomer Johannes Hevelius (1611-1689) [8]. One claim to fame derived from his observations of the Moon, which were published in his
Selenographia of 1647 and were far more detailed and nuanced than those created by Galileo in his
Sidereus Nuncius of 1610. However, perhaps the most striking fact is that Hevelius realized that
improved observations needed to be matched by excellence in draughtsmanship and engraving
worthy of publication and, therefore, he trained himself to engrave in copper, a work of great
skill [8]. Furthermore, unlike earlier scientific manuscripts in which text was dominant and
images secondary, he was pioneering in producing works in which this was stood on its head,
with the verbal text dependent on the dominant and splendid images [8]. His works are replete with precise descriptions of the tools, machinery and methods of
observation and one of his masterpieces is the engraving of a darkened room (figure 14) showing
how projecting solar images allows for safe observation of the Sun and of eclipses.”

By contrast, much painting of this period was influenced by the teachings of a resurgent
Catholic Church and a clear doctrine that divine power was revealed through natural forms [5].
