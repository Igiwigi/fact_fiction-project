value found by QUISCEE, about 1x 10-* centims., it may readily be shown from the
above formula that, if » differed from p by as much as 17 per cent., R would vary
3 per cent. between those thicknesses. As no such variation is observed we must
conclude either that the radius of molecular attraction is less than QUuINCKE's value or
that the mean specific resistance of the surface layer, the thickness of which is equal
to the radius of molecular attraction, does not differ by more than 17 per cent. from
that of the liquid in mass,

It is obvious that the electrical experiments confirm the accuracy of the revised
seale of colours. Had NewrTox's scale been used, the numbers analogous to those
given in columns II. and III, of Table IX. would have varied from 0884 to 1012.

Change of composition of the films. —The fact that films formed under constant
hygrometric conditions obey Onm's law having thus been proved, the second part of
the enquiry refers to the change of composition which might under other cireumstances
be produced.

This is illustrated by experiments on five films,

In the case of some of these the observed specific resistance rose as high as 204,
indicating, as that of the liquid in mass was only 1405, a considerable loss of water.

To determine this the specific resistance was first reduced to 20* C. by the formula

PE=Pyy{1+(0:03+0:000138)(20—t)}, (See p. 475.)
