2. The back-projection method

The imaging method discussed in this paper and that is currently under test, designed within
the context of MTR, is described in detail in [4]. Basically, it exploits the spatial extension of the
detector to localize structures of interest hidden inside large material volumes. The requirements
that the case study must satisfy for this method to hold its validity are basically geometric
constraints. A detector deployed at some depth below the level of an object, with the object in
its field of view, has in general a stereoscopic view of the object itself, in exactly the same way
as our eyes have a stereoscopic view of any object placed in our field of view. Different parts
of the detector in fact see an object along different directions and this remains valid until the
distance of the object from the detector is not excessive with respect to the size of the detector
itself. Otherwise, the detector could be approximated as a point-like detector, as is reasonable
to do in the case of measurements of volcanic edifices, where small detectors, compared with
the typical size of volcanoes, are located one or a few kilometres away from the target. If this
