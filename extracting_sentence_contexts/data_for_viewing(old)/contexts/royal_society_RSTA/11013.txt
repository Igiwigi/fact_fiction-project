best in etching lead in dilute nitric acid, is also of interest in this connection ; it has
already been described in the present paper (see p. 284). We there have a case of
lead dissolved from one crystal and deposited upon another crystal in its proper
orientation.

Tn view of these facts, we think it must be admitted that different crystal faces,
having a different orientation of their elements, differ in solubility in the same solvent.
To inquire into the cause of this difference is a further step in speculation which is,
perhaps, hardly necessary in this connection. Such differential actions may, however,
most probably be attributed to differences of electrical potential in the surfaces
involved. If we accept this view of the matter, then the diffusion across films of
eutectic becomes a case of electrolysis. Now, while diffusion in metals and alloys is
a proved fact, the possibility of electrolysis in an alloy has not yet been demonstrated
experimentally.* On the other hand, the close analogy with salt solutions leads one
to expect that alloys could be electrolysed, and those who have experimented in the
matter are not by any means certain that greater experimental resources will not
enable them to electrolyse alloys.

There is at least one fact in the phenomena of re-crystallisation which the solution
theory, apart from electrolysis, does not cover, while the electrolytic theory explains
it very readily. We refer to the fact that only strained crystals will grow, while
unstrained crystals show no tendency to change even at higher temperatures, The
explanation, on the electrolytic theory, is that in the unstrained state the crystals are
surrounded by practically continuous films of eutectic, and that electrolysis only
becomes possible when severe distortion has broken through these films in places,
