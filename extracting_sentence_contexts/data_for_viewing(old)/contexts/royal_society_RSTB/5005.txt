Wooncer (28), in the primitive-streak stages of the chick, finds only scattered
argentophil granules of different sizes in the cells, but in later stages the Golgi apparatus
assumes the typical form of granules or short rods arranged around a sphere at one

side of the nucleus. In reference to the Golgi apparatus, in earlier stages than those he
described in his paper, he states in literis :—‘‘ I consider it to be diffuse, but I have felt

it incautious to assert this dogmatically in my paper. As a matter of fact, I have sections
of unincubated blastoderms in which the cells are filled with exceedingly fine grains, just
as you find in the oocytes after the formation of the zona pellucida. At this stage they
are infinitely finer than those I have figured in the primitive-streak stage.”

In view of Woopgrr’s work on embryogeny and mine on oogenesis, it seems that the
Golgi apparatus of the young oocytes persists during maturation and fertilization as
fine scattered granules which are included in every blastomere at segmentation. They
remain in this condition in the embryonic cells up to the later primitive-streak stages,
and then gradually segregate to form the typical juxta-nuclear apparatus of each of the
differentiating cells. It would appear from this evidence that the Golgi bodies of the
oocyte of the fowl persist throughout development and form the apparatus of each
embryonic cell, as GATENBY and HirscHLEeR have shown to be the case in the mollusc.
