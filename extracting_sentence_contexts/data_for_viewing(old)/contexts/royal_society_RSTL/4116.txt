Lastly, the analyses contained in this paper may be of use at the present moment,
by contributing to show, how much still remains to be done, before we can flatter
ourselves at having attained any snre knowledge of the normal constitution of plants,
and of the range of variation of which under natural circumstances it is snsceptible,
At a time when certain enlightened members of the Royal Agricultural Society
have prevailed npon that great Body, to devote a portion of their funds to the prose-
cution of the chemical analysis of the ashes of vegetables, whatever tends to render
more palpable the importance of such an investigation, may be of service, in aiding
their meritorious efforts, to give a more scientific direction to the inquiries which such
z880ciations are intended to promote, and in vindicating the ntility of the course
which they have in this instance adopted.

Now the facts and observations detailed in the present paper contribute in two re-
spects towards this object, viz. by showing that the composition of the most commonly
cultivated plants is till open to much uncertainty; and 2ndly, by pointing out in
what way an exact knowledge of their inorganic ingredients might aid us towards the
solution of many important practical questions.

I hope, it will not be attributed to any blindness on iy part to the deficiencies and
imperfections which exist in this paper, if I remark, that an investigation of a similar
kind to the one herein detailed, if carried out on a more adequate scale, undertaken
on ground more carefully selected, conducted with a more vigilant attention to all
the minute circumstances which might influence the result, and accompanied by a
