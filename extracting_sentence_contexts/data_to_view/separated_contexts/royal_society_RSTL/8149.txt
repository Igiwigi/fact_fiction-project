Hence
there is no impoxsibility inyolved in the supposition that similar conditions may have
prevailed in Dictyoxzylon. ' These, however, are purely hypothetical suggestions; and the
further fact remains, that we have hitherto discovered no fruits that could, with reason-
able probability, be correlated with the stems in question. + Whatever may haye been their functions, these branches throw a clear light upon the
origin of the irregular vascular medullary cylinder seen even in very young Dictyoxylons,
and which . only remain, in a fragmentary tate, as detached buttresses supporting the
inner 8urfaces of the exogenous woody zones. But we must further study this subject in
the light of the facts described in my last memoir on Lepidodendroid plants.
