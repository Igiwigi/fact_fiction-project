that is

thing wn is determined by an equation of the same order as v, viz. # being prime, the

order is =n+1. The last term of the equation is constant, and the other coefficients
are rational and integral functions of uf, of a degree not exceeding 3(4—1); and not
only 80, but they are, n=1 (mod. 4), rational and integral functions of u(1—1), and
n=3 (mod. 4), alternately of this form, and of the same form multiplied by the factor
(1=2u).


'The values are in fact given as transcendental functions of q; viz. denoting by
M,, M,, M,..., M, the values corresponding to vs, v;, Vs, + + » Vn respectively, and writing
