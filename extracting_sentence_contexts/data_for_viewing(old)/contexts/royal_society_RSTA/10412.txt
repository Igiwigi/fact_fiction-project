appear to be due to the greater velocity of the currents where they meet over the
centre of the plates caused by the union of all the currents from the different sides.

554 MR. JOHN AITKEN ON THE FORMATION OF

The importance of the dustless film from the under side of the plate is evidenced by
the fact observed by Dr. Russetn that no figure is obtained unless the plate be
supported above the bottom of the receiver. When we examine by means of the
beam of light the surface of a plate laid on the bottom of the receiver, we still find
the dust-free film of air over the plate when the plate is pretty hot. This dustless
film is very thin at the edges and thickens towards the centre, and a rising current
can be seen flowing over it towards the centre, the rising current having a dustless
core. This dustless film soon disappears as the temperature of the plate falls, and
long before the plate is cold dust falls all over it, but no definite figures are formed.

Turning again to Dr. Russetr’s figures, the effect of the velocity of the current is
well shown in figs. 7 and 8. Fig. 7 was obtained with only a slight heating of the
plate, and fig. 8 by a higher temperature. In the former figure the slow currents
produced by the slight heating only kept the outside edges free from dust and
