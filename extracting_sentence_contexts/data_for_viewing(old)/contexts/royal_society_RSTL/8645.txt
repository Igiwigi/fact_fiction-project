over the east and s8outh of the Bay. The mean (sea-level) pressure at Port Blair is then
29-861, at Akyab 29867, at Madras 29-855, and at Calcutta 28:859, Hence the
pressure is nearly uniform around the coasts of the Bay, and, as might be expected,
calms are very frequent. Here, again, although less decidedly than in May, there can
hardly be any question of conflicting currents other than such as are temporary and due
to local irregularities. The north-east monsoon has not yet set in; and it is to be
remarked that at False Point, where north-east winds are most frequent, calms are also
more frequent than in any other month in the year.
'The atmosphere over the Bay is, then, calmer in October than in May ; but storms are
most frequent in the former month, and indeed, if we regard only those which disturb
Q the northern part of the Bay, one and a half times as frequent in October as in May®.
A Consequently a calm atmosphere or variable winds would appear to be a condition
5 fayouring the formation of cyclones; and this is yerified by the facts of the few storms
SZ of which I have been able to trace the antecedent conditions,
[= 1. The Calcutta storm of the 5th October, 1864, appears to have originated on or
S about the 2nd of the month, to the west of the Northern Andaman. For several days
© previously the winds in the north of the Bay were variable, but on the-whole southerly ;
= at Madras they were from east-south-east ; at Port Blair from south-west, then south-
Z east, and finally west-south-west ; and the pressure was lower at Port Blair than at any
= other station, It was not until the 2nd (that is, the day on which the storm formed)
S that a north-east wind set in down the Madras coast. From the readings of an uncom-
'S pared barometer at Port Blair, it would appear that the pressure at the Andamans had
= been lower than in Ceylon or at Madras or Calcutta, at all events since the 26th of
© September, perhaps earlier, and that it fell not less than 0-12 from noon of the 30th
Z September to noon of the 1st October,
