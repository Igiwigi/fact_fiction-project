The diminution of a given effect is greater in the former case than in the latter. That diminution is such that the effect of the combined faradic anode and galvanic
kathode is greater than that of the combined faradic kathode and galvanic anode. This fact was observed by BRUCKNER, who aw in it a proof of electrotonus inasgmuch
as the previously more effective faradic kathode is rendered the less effective during
the passage of an opposed galvanic current. To the statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 we have found no exception in all our experiments ;
statement, 5, though expressing the usual event with currents of medium strength,
requires qualification by this additional statement,

8. With increasing strength of the galvanic current, the effect of the anode of the
break induction current, when that anode 1s also kathode of the galvanic current
diminishes to a minimum, and with further increase in the swrength of the galvanic
eurrent increases up to and beyond the original normal.
