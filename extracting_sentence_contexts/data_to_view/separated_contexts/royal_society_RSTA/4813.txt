354 CAPTAIN E. W. CREAK ON THE MAGNETICAL

Before proceeding to show the remarkable amount of the disturbances of the
magnetic elements observed at Port Walcott, it must be remembered that the only
means available for obtaining the observations was on board a composite-built* vessel
with steam machinery ; in fact, that the observers had nolens volens placed the ship,
herself a disturbing magnet, between the instruments and the source of disturbance. It was therefore necessary, first of all, to determine to what extent this interposed
magnet, the ship, disturbed the needles on board. For this purpose the ship was.
swung off Baudin Island in 19 fathoms of water on May 6, 1891: (a) for values of
Dip and Intensity on the eight principal points of the compass; (b) simultaneous
observations of the Standard and Fox compasses for deviation on all points of the
compass.
