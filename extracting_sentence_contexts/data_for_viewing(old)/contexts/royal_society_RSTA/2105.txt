where L; is the initial piston position at t = 0 and Lz the end position at f = t.

Interestingly, also for the adiabatic work, the variational principle yields the same result for
L(t). This is a direct consequence of that fact that in the adiabatic processes dW(t) = dU(t) and
v,(t) = /2U()/fNm. The variation of the ensuing work 5Wgas involves terms
5Weas(t)
fNmiv-(t)â€™

Since we require 5Wgas(t) =0 for all f it then also implies that 5vz(t) =0. As a consequence, the
adiabatic variational principle yields the same solution as the isothermal case, as already stated
above.

In passing, it should be noted that there exists no smooth (non-singular) solution for the above
variational principle that satisfies the constraints L(to) = L(t) = 0. This, in turn, implies that it is
impossible to construct a machine that actually attains minimal irreversible energy losses and is
still compatible with those boundary conditions.
