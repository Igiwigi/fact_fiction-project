A huge number are dropped or have embraced the computing power of supercomputers;
side lined because they do not support mainstream opinion the ability to curate, organize and analyse massive volumes
or yield negative results. Meanwhile, neuroscience forges of data and thus to simulate and predict events and phenom-

ahead without a plan for the rapidly growing volumes of ena. Simulation modelling is, in fact, but just one of the many


aspects of applied mathematics that have benefited from expo-
nential growth in computing power. Advanced statistics,
notably machine and deep learning, nonlinear multi-variate
analysis and complexity mathematics are other relevant
examples. The armamentarium is large and sets the stage for
a paradigm shift from a purely hypothesis lead, reductionist
approach to neuroscience, to a data-led, hypothesis-generating
strategy, based on predictive simulation modelling.
