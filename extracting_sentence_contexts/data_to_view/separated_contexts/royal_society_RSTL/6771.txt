For, to compute it by
the principles I have formerly endeavoured to eſtabliſh,
let the number of our people in Britain and Ireland be
eight millions and an half, that is, five and an half in. Fagland and three millions in Scotland and. Ireland ;-

ecauſe ſome Iriſh Gentlemen have aſſured me, froms
ſome facts, that there is half a million more in their
country than I formerly allowed; for 1 did not pre-
tend to calculate them ; and then the annual number
of the dead, in Britain and Ireland, being one in 4o,.
will be about 212,500 ; which will be to the births.

baptiſms as' 83 to 149 ; which may poſlibly be the
caſe, as I myſelf have known it in one pariſh in the
Ule of Wight, where the place is healthy, and people
generally marry. But does he imagine that this pro-
