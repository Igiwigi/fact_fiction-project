that during the first twenty minutes after the stop the respiratory quotient shows
hardly any variation from the value obtained just previously to the exercise. Referring
to the results of the alveolar air analyses made under similar conditions and given in
Table TX., it will be seen that though the alveolar CO, pressure did not rise during
the exertion there was no appreciable alteration in the alveolar respiratory quotient,
nor were the alveolar CO, pressure nor the respiratory quotient altered in any
significant manner after the stop of the exercise. In two other instances we found
this to hold good after the lapse of periods of twelve minutes and twenty minutes
after the stop.

Our attempts therefore, so far as we went, to obtain indirect evidence of lactic acid
production on Pikeâ€™s Peak gave negative results up to the pace of four miles an hour.
Coupled with the fact that the alteration of the respiratory quotient was quite evident
when walking at two miles an hour and was not influenced by the duration of the exer-
tion, this throws us back for an explanation on an alteration of the metabolism, which
would mean that during the exercise a larger proportion of carbohydrate was utilised
than in the resting period.

We make this suggestion with some diffidence as it is contrary to the accepted
view, for the great majority at least of the previous observations have shown that the
relative proportions of carbohydrate and fat consumed remain the same during work
and rest.* Very likely a longer duration of the exercise than in our experiments would
have given a lower value of the respiratory quotient, for if carbohydrate is being
more readily used than fat, prolongation of the exercise must lead to a diminution of
the amount of carbohydrate available. It is possible that our result is bound up with
