In conclusion I must mention that, since this paper has been in manuscript, Sir
Wi Trors0s, in his Address to the Mathematical Section of the British Association
at Glasgow, has expressed his opinion on this same 8ubject. He there shortly states
results in the main identical with mine, but without indicating how they were arrived at. The great interest which this subject has recently been exciting both in England and
America, coupled with the fact that several of my results are not referred to by Sir
W1lLLilax 'THoMs80N, induces me to persist in offering my work to the Royal Society. 1. PRECESSION OF A SPHEROID SLOWLY CHANGING ITS SHAPE.
