808 MR. HANCOCK ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE BRACHIOPODA.

ing minute channels which run diagonally across the muscular fibres. And this belief
is in s0ome measure confirmed by the fact, that no mention is made of this beautiful
and remarkable system of sinuses in any of the several memoirs on the subject published
by that observer.

From the feeble nature of these brachial muscles it does not seem likely that in
Watldheimia the spiral portion of the arms can be unrolled. 'The true function of the
brachial canal would seem to be to sustain the grooved ridge bearing the cirri, As
the canal is a closed tube, and as it undoubtedly contains fluid, a very slight contraction
of its walls will render it firm and rigid. The coil may also, perhaps, be loosened a
little by the same action ; thus giving greater freedom to the cirri. The grooved ridge
will in this way become firmly seated, so that its movements may be regulated with
precision. These are effected by a very complicated piece of mechanism, which is
rendered obyious on making a transverse section of the part, when the substance of the
