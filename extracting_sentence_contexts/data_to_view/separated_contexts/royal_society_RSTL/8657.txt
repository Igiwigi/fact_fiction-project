If the surfaces touch also at the point P,, we may in like manner use as the formulze
for elimination the following, viz.

fact the equivalence of the two forms may be readily shown as follows. The first result
is a rational function, homogeneous in the two quantities 1"-'0, 01 . 1-22, 8ay

and in like manner the second may be represented by the equation
