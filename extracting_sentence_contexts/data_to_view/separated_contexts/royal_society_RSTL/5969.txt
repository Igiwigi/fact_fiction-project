But observing that [9]?
vanishes for I>9g, that is, I>%—3—1, it is in fact the same thing whether the series is
continued indefinitely or only to the term for which I=2—3—1, and we may consist-
ently with the condition $>n—2, continue the series as far as I=2n—8—1, except in
the case 3=0, when by doing 80 we include the term corresponding to 9=2—1, which
i virtue of the condition ought to be excluded. The expression for the term in question
is (=Y"[—1}[—1}*; hence if the sum of the series continued to the proper point is S,
the sum continued indefinitely (in the particular cage 38=0) is S+(—Y=[—1F[—1F.
but in every other case the um continued indefinitely is simply S. And by a well-known

theorem in finite differences, the 8wm continued indefinitely is in fact zero. That is.
except in the case 8=0, we have

; D=05
but in the excepted case

S+(—Y="[—1}[—1F=0;
or observing that «+B(=r—3) is in this case ==

and transforming the factorials, we
have

S=(—Y"Te}[BP,

or substituting for « and Þ their values,

S=(— Yo[8ÞFr—s)Þ—. MR.
