The molecular depression is relatively greater in those solutions where the ionization
is complete, or nearly complete, and relatively less where the conductivity shows that
more of the salt is electrically inactive.

Whether this relation between the electrical ionization and the depression of
freezing point is exact or only approximate is one of the most important questions
in the present state of the theory of solution, and, although an enormous amount of
experimental work has been devoted to the subject, it is still a question the answer
to which remains uncertain.

This uncertainty arises from two causes. The first is the difficulty of determining
the extremely small freezing-point depressions of very dilute solutions, and the
second is the fact that most of the comparisons have been made with the ionization
of solutions measured by KontrauscH, Ostwap and others at temperatures of
18° or 25° Centigrade. Now, unless the temperature coefficients of conductivity are
the same for different concentrations of a solution, the ionization at 18° will not be
the same for a definite concentration as the ionization at 0°, with which it is evident
that the freezing point phenomena should be compared.

As far as is known to the present writer, the only measurements of the ionization of
electrolytic solutions which have been made at 0° are those of R. W. Woop.* He
finds that the ionization of solutions of potassium chloride, sodium chloride, dichlor-
acetic acid, and trichloracetic acid is, as long as the dilution is great, sensibly the
same at 0° as it is at 18°, or, at all events, that the difference between the values at
these temperatures is not enough to bring the conductivity measurements into
