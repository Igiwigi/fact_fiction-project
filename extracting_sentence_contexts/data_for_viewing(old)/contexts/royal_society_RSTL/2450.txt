air that finds admittance is in great measure deprived of its oxygen, as a likelier mode
of accounting for the peculiar constitution of the gas emitted ; and conceiving that
the carbonic acid that accompanies it, is more probably derived from the calcination
of earthy carbonates, than from the combustion of beds of coal or bitumen, I am led
to conclude from the frequent absence of other gaseous products, that the oxygen
becomes united to some base, which forms with it a compound not easily volatilized
by heat.

How far these conclusions, if considered to be substantiated, tend to support that
theory of volcanos and the connected phenomena, which naturally emanated from
the discoveries of our former illustrious President, who also, at one period at least of
his life, himself advocated it, must be left for the Society to decide, as it would ill
become me to do more, than to lay before its members a statement of such facts, as
appear to bear upon a question, respecting which the highest authorities in science
have been divided.

In conc]usion, therefore, it only remains, that I should express my obligations to
the gentlemen who constitute the Committee of the Bath Waters, to whom I applied
for leave to institute the above observations, for their ready acquiescence in my wishes,
and for the facilities afforded me in the prosecution of these researches.

I must, likewise, acknowledge the kind assistance I received from several of the
residents of Bath, particularly from Mr. G. Sery, who has long taken an active con-

Davixs, Fellow of the Royal and the Astronomical Societies, a gentleman well known
