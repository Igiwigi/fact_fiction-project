When all three have interventions, the 18
model suggests that inundation is removed entirely. However, the two later peaks (on 7th and : s
15th February) do not see such positive impact. In fact, the attenuation of the larger peaks 18

means that inundation durations are either unaltered or even prolonged slightly. The model
suggested the largest intervention could prolong inundation from the middle and largest peaks
by 45 min. A series of seven design storms (all of which cause downstream outfall inundation) were also
generated using FEH catchment descriptors and run through the coupled model.
