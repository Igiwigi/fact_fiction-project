A The expression for the correction for the internal air will be gob from the above by
changing the 8ign of ma and of the whole, or, in other words, by changing the signs
Sof the 2nd, 4th, 6th . . . terms in the series in (21) or (22), It will be remembered
Sthat ma is f(cos 45*+! 8in 45*).

'Z In the previous experiments the main loss of energy arising from the friction of the
Zair may be characterised as being due to the fact that the air is pushed. A small
Sportion, however, of the loss is occasioned by the rotation of the cylinders or spheres
Zabout their own axes, and in this case the air may be said to be dragged. Professor
SG. G. SToKrs has, in the preceding note, deduced formulez by means of which this
glast portion of the whole loss of energy can be calculated, and it seemed of interest
&to determine whether the coefficient of viscosity of air would prove to be the same as
Bbefore, when the air was entirely dragged. This will oceur when only one sphere or
Sone cylinder is used, whose axis is made to coincide with the axis of rotation.
S Accordingly I followed out a suggestion of Professor Stokes in the manner detailed
Ain the following experiments.
