(i) It is difficult to robustly narrow down the uncertainty range as to when the Arctic 3
becomes free of sea ice during summer by rejecting individual models from the ensemble. 7
This is primarily because the link between the past and the future evolution of the Ny
modelled sea-ice state is often not robust enough, and because internal variability :B
hinders us to reject most models as unrealistic. Hence, in addition to estimates :
from emerging constraints, a probability distribution of an ice-free Arctic Ocean as :
estimated from all models might be the most insightful way of informing policy makers
(figure 2).

(ii) Both the simulated mean and the simulated trend of sea-ice area and sea-ice volume
are too variable even for 30-year-long periods to robustly ascribe a possible mismatch
between models and observations to a shortcoming of most models. This is partly
related to the fact that we lack an independent estimate of the true internal variability
of the system.

(iii) The usefulness of the long-term mean or the long-term trend of the 35-year-long record
of Arctic sea-ice observations is limited by the fact that its length only allows for five
data points for any 30-year mean value or any 30-year trend. These five data points are
too variable in time and too much influenced by internal variability to allow for a robust
model evaluation. By contrast, a 35-year-long record provides 35 data points for, say, the
seasonal cycle, which then allows for a much more robust assessment of the adequacy of
individual models.

In summary, despite its widespread use, the direct comparison of model simulations with
observations often only allows for rather limited inferences about the shortcomings of a particular
