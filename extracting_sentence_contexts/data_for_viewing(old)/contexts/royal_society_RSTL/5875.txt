rated from each other by a considerable space, which is divided on the median line by a
delicate, membranous septum. "The two chambers thus formed communicate with the
perivisceral cavity, by two small oyal orifices* placed one on each side of the septum ;

these orifices open into the cavity close behind the cesophagus, and directly above a
transverse fold of the anterior wall of the body. It is not altogether unlikely that these
chambers likewise communicate with the posterior canals, but I have failed to ascertain
the fact; and Voer! also states that the two canals of the arm are cut off from the
perivisceral cavity. Above the orifices there is another delicate membranous fold or
flap, which seems capable of closing them by being pressed down against the parietal
fold, to which the occlusor mnscles are attached, acting in the manner of a valve.
The membranous wall of the posterior canals is composed of two layers, an outer
homogeneous, and an inner muscular layer, each having its proper epithelium. The
fibres of the latter layer run, for the most, part, diagonally across the canal, becoming
Stransverse towards the part furthest from the grooved ridge. Here there is als pro-
vjecting into the canal a stout muscular band of a brown colour with the fibres longi-
tudinal, and extending the whole length of the organ. Throughout it is firmly attached
Sto the wall of the canal, and terminates at the root of the arm.
