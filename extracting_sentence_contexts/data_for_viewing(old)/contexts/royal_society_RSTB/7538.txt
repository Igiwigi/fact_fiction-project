560 F. J. RICHARDS ON PHYLLOTAXIS

Whatever the ultimate solution of these problems may be, the applicability of the analytical
methods proposed will remain unaffected. At first sight they appear to rest on two assump-
tions: uniformity of tangential primordial spacing and constancy of plastochrone ratio as
measured on sections from the successive pairs of primordia. Only if both these are true will
the parastichies as seen in transverse projection be logarithmic spirals, and these curves
have been used in the establishment of the theoretical relation between parastichy inter-
section angle and plastochrone ratio, and hence also phyllotaxis index.

The approximate regularity in tangential spacing, and the apparently extraordinary
exactness with which the mean divergence angle may approach particular irrational values,
have long been recognized as facts, at least in the vast majority of plants, and studies in leaf
arrangement from the first have been stimulated by these phenomena, and largely confined
to them. The second assumption, constancy of the plastochrone ratio, might on the con-
trary legitimately be questioned, and with it therefore the description of the parastichies as
logarithmic spirals. As d’Arcy Thompson (1942, p. 918) states, ‘the curves resemble, and
sometimes closely resemble, the logarithmic spiral; but that they are, strictly speaking,
logarithmic is neither proved nor capable of proof’; and again (p. 914), ‘They doubtless
resemble the logarithmic or equiangular spiral, but different spirals may look much alike;
and these are ill-suited to the careful admeasurement and rigorous verification which
Moseley gave to the spirals of his molluscan shells.’

In the first place, when estimates are made of the transverse distances of the successive
primordia from the apical centre, the logarithms of these distances are never exactly in
