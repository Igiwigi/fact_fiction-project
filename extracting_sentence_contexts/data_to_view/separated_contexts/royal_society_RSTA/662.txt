For a more detailed pedagogical introduction, we mention review
articles on geometrically frustrated magnets [2] and their Coulomb phase [3] and spin ice [4].

2. Emergent gauge fields

Antiferromagnets present an impressive variety of possible ground state configurations, crucially
depending on the geometry of the lattice where the spins reside. This is related to the fact
that interactions are frustrated once the lattice contains odd length loops and the ground state
configurations become highly degenerate. This high degeneracy can usually be traced back to an
underconstraint in the system of equations found by minimizing the Hamiltonian [5]. This idea,
amusingly enough, can also be traced back to Maxwell [6].
