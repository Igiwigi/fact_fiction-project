MACALISTER certainly states that branches
from the cardinal veins enter the kidneys, forming a reno-portal capillary plexus,
and GEGENBAUR mentions the existence of similar ven@ renales advehentes as branches
of the caudal. But neither author gives a sufficiently detailed account to enable
the reader to understand what the exact relations of the renal portal system are
supposed to be. As a matter of fact JourDarxs, following up the earlier researches of Jacops0N,
Ropin, STEENSTRA Tous8AINT, and others,* has clearly proved the existence of a
renal portal system in Raja, Squatina, Squalus, and Spinau, in all of which he
shows there to be no direct passage for blood between the caudal and the cardinal
veins in the adult. I have confirmed JourDaAin's results in Raju nasuta (21, 23),
and now find that they hold good also for Mustelus antarcticus. The renal portal veins (Plate 34, figs. 1 and 3; Plate 37, figs. 22, 23, 24, Ren,
