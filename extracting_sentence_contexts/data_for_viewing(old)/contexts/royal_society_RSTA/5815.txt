kinds of perturbations might arise, leading to difficulties in accepting this picture (in technical
language, we refer here to the property of ‘linearization instability’ and the existence of spurious
perturbations [11-15], as well as the existence of ‘spikes’ [16]).

There are, however, precise mathematical results about the behaviour of spatially
homogeneous G3 solutions [17-19], and about more general, inhomogeneous ones, the so-called
Gz solutions [20], which can also be given a description in terms of a past attractor (see also [21,22]
for recent Hamiltonian methods). However, for the general Go case without any symmetries, only
conjectures can be framed, cf. [23] for a precise presentation (see also [24~28] for other details and
numerical results). In this paper, we shall follow the notation of [23].

But perhaps a major obstacle for the plausibility and proof of the BKL conjecture is the
fact that the behaviour of the homogeneous Mixmaster universe is already formally a chaotic
system [29,30]. It possesses a smooth invariant measure [31], with a corresponding shift map
[32], and a detailed statistical theory for the Mixmaster stochastic behaviour can be readily
built [6,7]. Another complication, possibly related to the chaotic behaviour, this time seen in
the generic evolution of each spatial point in the inhomogeneous case, is connected with the so-
called gravitational turbulence [33]. This is also related to the so-called process of fragmentation,
or cellular structure, an effect discovered by Kirillov & Kochnev [34,35] and independently
by Montani [36], also recently elaborated by Barrow [37]. This process, as described in these
references, is supported by a claimed monotonic increase of spatial gradients of the metric on
approach to the singularity. It arises through the transport of energy from large to small scales,
because the Mixmaster oscillatory regime in the inhomogeneous case is ‘unstable’ and may
