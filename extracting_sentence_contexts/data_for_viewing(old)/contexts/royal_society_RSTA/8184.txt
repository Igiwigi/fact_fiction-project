and the next can then be commenced, by slow
rotation of the big wheel, counting the bands
as they pass steadily through the silver-ring
reference centre and pair of spider-lines, and
adjusting the speed so as to secure deliberate counting. To miss a band or
make a single error in counting is, of course, fatal. A very helpful fact, however,
is that if one rests the ball of the hand on the top of the pedestal on which
the big driving wheel is mounted, and which is fortunately so shaped as to make
a comfortable rest, and effects the rotation of the wheel with the first finger and
thumb, it so happens that one can only pull the wheel over sufficiently to bring one
more band to the centre, so that two bands at a time in rapid succession can never
pass and cause any missing of a band. One band per second is a very suitable speed,
both safe and not tiring. After the passage of 100 bands, the fact is noted in oneâ€™s
notebook, and each 100 as it arrives is duly given its proper sequence number. As the
end of the interval approaches one slows down, for a look has to be given to the micro-
scope ; the eye can safely be taken momentarily from the interferometer telescope to do
so, as the bands immediately stop moving when the big wheel is arrested, at most half
a band of further movement occurring. This slight backlash is not a defect, but due to a
minute amount of spring possessed by the steel-coil shaft, which is used in preference
to a solid one to connect the big wheel with the driving worm, which actuates the worm
wheel-head of the very accurate screw which moves the microscope-carrying block,
such a coiled shaft being free from disturbing thrust. Eventually, when we are entering
on the last 100 bands, the next location-signal comes in sight in the field of the micro-
scope, and we can go as slowly as necessary, with momentary and intermittent trans-
ference of the eye from interferometer to microscope, until at last the middle ruling
