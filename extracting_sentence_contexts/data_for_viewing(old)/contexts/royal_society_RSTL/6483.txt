boring whenever the instrument was withdrawn.

The foregoing section is situated, from the first three, as nearly as possible in the
direction of the Strike of the formation. It has a depth about the same as the pit
at its western end, where a vertical line cuts 27 © coal” beds having an aggregate
thickness of nearly 36 feet; instead of the solitary layer of 2 inches only in the Table
Jjust given. Those beds are known to exist, in unbroken continuity, along the entire
length of the western tunnel and the coal-pit, and onwards to the old engine-shaft, a
distance of nearly half a mile; here they suddenly cease and their place is supplied by a
series of beds having the characteristics of the uppermost portion of the second division
of the pit sections. The contrast of the two will be seen in Plate LIV.

There can be no doubt that these facts are evidence of a great fault; that the beds
on the east of it are an upper portion of the Bovey deposit, preserved, through the
intervention of a vertical displacement of at least 100 feet, from the denuding action
which swept it away on the west, after it had, by its pressure, assisted to flatten the
timber in the uppermost stratum of lignite at present existing there ; and that this denu-
dation occurred before the deposition of the © Head,” since this is found covering the
deposit alike, without considerable variation in its thickness, on each side of the
< fault.” It will be understood that it is by no means intended to intimate that this is
the only fault in the Bovey formation ; the occurrence of beds of lignite, near the
Surface, in yarious parts of the Heathfield, renders it probable that there is, at least,
another. Nor is it meant to_express the opinion that the * Head ” itself may not have
lost much by denudation ; $0 far as they are at present understood, certain facts 8eem
to imply that it may have suffered much in this way.
