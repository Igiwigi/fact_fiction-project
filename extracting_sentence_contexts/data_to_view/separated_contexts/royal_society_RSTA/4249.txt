Nevertheless, its performances are worse than those produced by the reversed COS classification
of the raw dataset—the dashed black curve is clearly above the solid blue one. However, if
we apply the PostP method to the COS classification of the pre-processed hypercube, we get a
better performance than any other COS classification with or without post-processing. In fact, the
solid blue ROC curve is above all the others in figure 6a. We can also try to apply the wavelet
transform as a denoising post-processing method. If we plot the corresponding ROC curve,
its performances are slightly worse than those obtained using the proposed method—the solid
