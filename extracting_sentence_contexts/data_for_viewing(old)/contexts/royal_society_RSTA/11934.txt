* There were three slits in the comparison shutter where this line occurs, so that three small pieces of
the line at atmospheric pressure appeared upon the photograph. Two of them may be seen on the
reproduction at 60 atmospheres. They permit the comparison line to be easily placed parallel to the
double cross-wires in the measuring machine.


EFFECT OF PRESSURE UPON ARC SPECTRA.—SILVER. 39

nebulous flutings do not occupy this particular part of the plate. At 200 atmospheres
the spectrum is, as in other parts of the plate, nearly a continuous one.

5. The Broadening of the Lines.—From the photographs we learn the following
facts within the region \ 4000 to \ 4600 :— :

1. All silver lines broaden under pressure.

2. The broadening increases with the pressure, but different amounts of exposure
make it difficult to determine if the increase is continuous and linear with the
pressure.

3. The broadening of the two Ist sub-series lines is, at normal atmospheric pressure,
unsymmetrical relatively to the superposed absorption line; increase of pressure
increases the width of these lines, and their wings are then seen to consist of numbers
of fine lines which merge into one another at higher pressure,
