'= 16. Of Thiipsinomic Ares.

E If, under given conditions, any symmetrical system or function of the constituents
& of one of the above matrices be null, then under the same conditions will the contra-
5 variant system or function of the constituents of the inverse matrix be null or infinite.
DTherefore Systems of Thiipsinomic Axes coincide with the corresponding systems of
” Tasinomic Axes.

Z 17. Platythliptic Coefficients are negative.

=

It may be observed as a matter of fact, that in consequence of the largeness of
-2 the Euthytatic Coefficients (z*), (Þ*), (4), as compared with the other Tasinomic
Coefficients, the Platythliptic Coefficients (bc), (ca), (ab) are generally, if not always,
S negative.
ZZ To illustrate this, the case of Pantatic Isotropy may be taken, for which the two
E matrices have the following forms ;—
