Such specimens do not, in any way, represent the external form of the seed,
as will be shown in my description. The entire specimen in fig. 94.represents the exact
form of the interior of the testa, the lower or tumid portion of it corresponding to the
nucleus with its thin investing membranes, and the prolonged upper portion, with its
three diminishing concave surfaces, of which only one appears in the figure, repre-
senting the interior of an elongated micropyle. It is important that this fact should be
correctly understood, since many of even the most recent references to these secds are
rendered erroneous by a confusion between their external contours and their internal
casts. Thus Dr. Bairouk describes 7. oliveforme as © an ovate, acuminate, three-ribbed,

' and striated fruit or seed ” (* Palzeontological Botany,” p. 63), whereas it was twelve-ribbed,
and we have no evidence whatever that its surface was striated.
