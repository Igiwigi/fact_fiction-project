State dependence of the ocean mass adjustment alone, on the other hand, does have a dramatic
effect. Figure 4 shows the bifurcation sets and maximum maps for fixed ne =0 and for n- =0.11

in figure 4a and for nc =0.22 in figure 4b. Already for nc =0.11, the difference with the case of D8
nc = 0 in figure 3 is striking: resonance tongues have become wider and overlap more, with larger if
regions where one finds period-doublings. The torus bifurcation curve now extends to c = 10 near : x
the top of figure 4a, and there is a notable change in the size of the observed maxima. Moreover, : =
there is a region with complex dynamics and additional saddle-node and torus bifurcation curves :2

that entered the frame at large values of c above 7 = 1. These are caused by the state dependence
— large c values mean large amplitude, which leads to larger fluctuations of the delay time t,. In
fact, the scaling relationship between c and 1, as a result of equation (2.6) implies that these curves
will diverge off to c—> 00 as n- — 0; similarly, they move closer to the other bifurcation curves
as nc increases. The existence of non-trivial dynamics for large values of c is in stark contrast
to the dynamics in the constant-delay case, where solutions for sufficiently large c are trivially
dominated by the periodic forcing.

Figure 4b, now for nc = 0.22, shows a considerably more complicated bifurcation set compared
with figure 4a. The bifurcation curves that emerge from the right-hand side of figure 4a have
shifted towards lower values of c in figure 4b, such that they now interact with the pre-
existing structure of resonance tongues. This gives rise to many more and overlapping resonance
tongues that extend all the way to large values of c near Tt, =1. In this region, we find many
and overlapping curves of subsequent period-doublings, which we refer to here as a period-
doubling cluster. In this part of the (c,7,)-plane, there are not only period-doubling cascades
