first papilla or the cornified plug, according to the degree of injury and consequent
type of regeneration. This is illustrated by the diagrams of cross-sections in figs.
45-51, Plates 25-27. Fig. 45, Plate 25, is through the tip of the follicle, and shows an
indefinite mass of cornifying material within a thick sheath. The sheath of the
follicle is also unusually thick, and the distinction between the two sheaths is very
obscure. In this cornifying mass attempts at ridge formation may be seen, fig. 45a,
Plate 25. Fig. 46, Plate 26, is slightly lower down, and shows the tip of the second
papilla ; fig. 47, Plate 26, shows the beginning of the crease which marks the region
where a constriction will take place between the distal and proximal parts of the
second papilla. Above this crease, traces of barbs are to be seen among the inter-
mediate cells of the second papilla. These never form true barbs, although they
cornify and become separated from the rest of the epidermis, figs. 48-50, Plates 26-27.
The curvature of the whole follicle is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial
transverse sections, both first and second, and finally all three papillae are present
in the same section, for a certain distance down the follicle. Near the base, the
second and third papillae are completely separated by dermal tissue. This is fore-
shadowed in fig. 51, Plate 27, where the proximal and distal parts of the follicle are
separated by intermediate cells.

Regeneration of feathers after plucking, therefore, differs from normal regenera-
tion, owing to the base of the follicle in the former condition having to regenerate
