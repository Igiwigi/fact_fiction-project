velocity at which a fluid, which enters a pipe in a high state of turbulence, passes
from eddying motion to stream-line motion, and which is well defined in all the pipes
used in these experiments except the small one under discussion. The other refers to
the case in which a perfectly undisturbed fluid enters a pipe in stream-line motion
which persists until, with considerable care, a velocity of about seven times that of the
former critical velocity can be reached before it breaks down into eddying motion.
If shght disturbances are present this breakdown occurs earlier.

It is evident that the behaviour of the small pipe in these experiments is analogous
to the second case of critical velocity mentioned by Rrynonps, and that the
turbulence existing outside the orifice to this pipe was not sufficiently violent to
correspond to turbulent flow, whereas in the case of the other pipes it was so.
Further confirmation of this was found in the fact that by fitting a bell mouth-piece

inlet to the pipe to ensure steadier conditions, and making a series of observations of
surface friction, the velocity at which the flow became fully eddying, as shown by the
ordinates of the curve reaching the same value as for the other pipes, was almost
precisely that found by ReyNoups for his upper limit, 7.Â¢., at a value of vd/v = 16000.

When the mouth-piece was removed and the fluid, which in this case was air, was
drawn into the open end of the pipe from the room, by the suction of a gas holder,
the observations plotted in fig. 8 were obtained. These show a critical value of
