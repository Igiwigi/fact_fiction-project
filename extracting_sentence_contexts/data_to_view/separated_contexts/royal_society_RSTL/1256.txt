A considerable portion of the descending true
sap certainly stagnates above the wound, and of that which
escapes into the bark below it, the greater part is probably
carried towards, and into, the roots; where it preserves life,
and occasions some degree of growth to take place. But a
small portion of that fluid will be carried upwards by capillary
attraction, between the bark and the alburnum, exclusive of
the immediate action of the latter substance, and the whole
of this will stagnate on the lower lip of the wound ; where I
conceive it generates the small portion of wood and bark,
which Hares and Du Hamtr have described. I should scarely have thought an account of the pr-ceding
experiments worth sending to you, but that many of the
conclusions I have drawn/in former memoirs appear, at first
view, almost incompatible with the facts stated by HaLes and

Du HamtL, and that I had one fact to communicate relative
to the effects produced by the stagnation of the descending
sap of resinous trees, which appeared to lead to important
consequences. TI have in my possession a piece of a fir-tree,
from which a portion of bark, extending round its whole
stem, had been taken off several years before the tree was
felled; and of this portion of wood one part grew above, and
the other below, the decorticated space. Conceiving that, ac-
cording to the theory I am endeavouring to support, the wood
above the decorticated space ought to be much heavier than
that below it, owing to the stagnation of the descending sap,
I ascertained the specific gravity of both kinds, taking a
wedge of each as nearly of the same form, as I could obtain,
and I found the difference greatly more than I had anticipated,
the specific gravity of the wood above the decorticated space
being 0.590, and of that below only 0.491: and having steeped
pieces of each, which weighed a hundred grains, during twelve
hours in water, I found the latter had absorbed 69 grains, and
the former only z1.
