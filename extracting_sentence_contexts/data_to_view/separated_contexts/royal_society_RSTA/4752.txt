According to the principles of our ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics [6],
the universe is always in a state where all beables 6;(t) at all times t, take precisely defined values. Therefore, the photons emitted by the source « must have well-defined polarizations in exactly
the same basis that is later employed by Alice and Bob, already when they are emitted, at time
t=fp in figure 1. This feature is an evident fact of all explicit models that we can produce, and
is the central assumption of the CAI, but now it is also clear that it is exactly here that we have


to face our ‘conspiracy’ problem. Did the photons commit ‘conspiracy’ by knowing in advance
which basis to pick, the very same basis that Alice and Bob would decide to choose, by consulting
the distant quasars, or the mice in their cages? Quantitatively: we must explain how the photons could ‘pick’ the basis a for photon w and
basis b for photon 8, already at time t = t.
