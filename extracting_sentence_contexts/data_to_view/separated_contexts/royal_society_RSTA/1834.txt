The total percentage spread of the values of s (or Â«) in the group is in most cases

* satisfactorily small. The value of 6-7 per cent. for the high velocity group of type I.
shells is probably partly due to the fact that the fuzes of shells 1-to 4 were slightly
damaged before firing in forcing the shells into the cartridge cases. At a velocity of 1580 fs. results were obtained with guns of both twists of rifling. The couple deduced from the results for the gun rifled one turn in 40 calibres is, in the
cases of shells of types I. and IIL. slightly smaller than that deduced from the other
gun.
