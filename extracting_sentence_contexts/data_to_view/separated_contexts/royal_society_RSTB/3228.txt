RenAvuttt says “dans les Sigillaires cannelées, Favularia tessellata, Fav. Saulii,
les cdtes longitudinales dues 4 de vraies cannelures sont trés appréciables sur la
surface interne de la zone subéreuse.” Scort,t in his “Studies,” concludes that “the ribs may be looked upon as
representing a series of fused leaf-bases, a view which is supported by the fact that
the ligular pit, which must clearly have belonged to the leaf-base, is placed on the rib
immediately above each leaf-scar.” The structure of the ribs of a Sigillarian stem of the Rhytidolepis section with
distant leaf-scars, such as Sigillaria scutellata, Bronen., is fully illustrated by the
material described here. The leaf-bases, consisting of parenchymatous elements,
form, in the uncrushed condition, bracket-shaped projections from the surface of the
rib, the sloping shelf of the bracket bearing the leaf-scar and also the ligular pit
