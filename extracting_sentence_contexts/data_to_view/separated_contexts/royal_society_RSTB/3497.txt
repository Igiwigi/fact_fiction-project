crest, and more particularly that of the Trigeminus ganglion, in the Gymnophiona. In his text-figures and descriptions, the differentiation from the neural crest of three
ganglionic lobate expansions, much as we have shown to occur in Ornithorhynchus,
becomes manifest (cf: eg., his text-fig. B). Were it not for the fact of the association
of this phase of ganglionic development with the uprising of medullary folds, the
resemblance to the condition in the neurular stage of the Monotreme would be even
more striking. In reference to trigeminal development, Brauer claims to demonstrate that the
ophthalmic portion of the Trigeminus-ganglion complex has both a separate and
a different origin from that of the maxillo-mandibular component. The former
originates solely from a thickened epidermal placode, and receives no contribution
from the neural crest.
