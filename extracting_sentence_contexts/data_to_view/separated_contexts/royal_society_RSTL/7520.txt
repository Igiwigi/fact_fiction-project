, Some other general conclusions may be fairly educed from this
result. It is of course well known that plants by exposure to air constantly absorb oxygen and
exhale carbonic acid. Now the further fact may be added, that, of the oxygen absorbed
during a day, part may not appear as carbonic acid till after the expiration of a week. This explains the cireumstance noticed by DE SAusSURE and others, that the volume of
carbonic acid exhaled during a day is sometimes more and sometimes less than that of
the oxygen absorbed. The actual process is not 80 simple as has been generally supposed.
