same way on the working hypothesis (since the larger gaps here, as usually, were also
the farther from the growing-point), and the next task was therefore to consider how
the behaviour of the first and second primordia after the isolated primordium can be
explained. Although the explanation is not so simple and obvious as that of the
behaviour of the later-formed primordia, yet it is shown in Sections (7) to (13) of Part 2
that very probable explanations can be offered on the basis of the working hypothesis,
and these explanations are supported by various observations. This part of the investi-
gation was inevitably rather lengthy and complicated, but from it there emerged points
of interest concerning the shapes of the primordia, the manner in which they occupy
the available spaces, and the circumstances in which they become asymmetric. In
Part 3 it was shown that the results of isolating I, can also very well be explained on
the working hypothesis. It is therefore concluded that the working hypothesis, since
it covers adequately all the main facts, is probably in the main correct, though future
experiments may easily show that it needs to be added to or qualified in various ways.

Van IreRson, as was stated in the introduction, has shown in a masterly manner
that most of the main facts of phyllotaxis can be explained as necessary consequences,
if four so-called “ facts of observation ” are taken as granted. One of these was that
the new primordia arise in the larger gaps between the previous ones, but, until the
point was experimentally tested, it was really only an assumption that the positions
of the new primordia are actually determined by the positions of these gaps. The
present experiments show that they are so determined, and consequently the probability
of his theory is greatly increased. His theory is, however, worked out only for plants
in which the primordia may be considered to be circular in outline, and consequently
it needs to be further considered to what extent it will hold good for plants such as the
