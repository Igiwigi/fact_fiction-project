This is quantified by integrating the incident SWR that effectively reaches the
ocean surface, that is, after being attenuated by clouds and sea ice over the year. This is shown
in figure 1 in the cumulative SWR anomaly between polynya versus no-polynya years. In fact,
higher cumulative SWR should lead to a general increase in PP in the Arctic Ocean and its
marginal seas [80] where enough nutrients are available in the euphotic zone [64,81]. As a result of
the controlling effect of sea ice on phytoplankton production and, hence, food availability for the
bivalves, correlations between local sea-ice cover and the growth rate of benthic organisms can
be expected and have already been observed. Very high concentrations of sea ice can be viewed
as an inhibitor of PP and the growth of consumers, and, by contrast, a low sea-ice cover leads
to increased PP and food availability for the benthos.
