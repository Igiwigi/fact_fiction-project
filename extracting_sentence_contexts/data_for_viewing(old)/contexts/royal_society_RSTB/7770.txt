'= All the specimens studied are somewhat variable in colour, individuals ranging from
- black to white, the lighter parts being translucent and the whole surface shiny. It has not
ES proved possible to obtain any chemical analyses of their composition.

E Comparison with other faunas
‘3 There is little agreement concerning the exact American equivalent of the Llandeilo
Limestone, but Shimer (1934, Chart A) shows the Llandeilo as broadly equivalent to the
@ Black River or Chazy formations. Dr Alwyn Williams (personal communication, June
= 1950) states: “... the presence of Nemagraptus gracilis in the Black River indicates that
fany pre-Black River, post-Beekmantown rocks should correlate with the Llandeilo.
3 G. A. Cooper, however, considers that the Llandeilo and Black River are equivalent since
& both mark the horizon at which the punctate brachiopods first make their appearance,
3 but against this is the fact that I have collected punctate brachiopods from the Upper
$ Llanvirn.’ Branson & Mehl (1933, p. 20) consider the base of the Stones River represents
3 the base of the Llandeilo.
Q_ It is therefore difficult to give any exact American equivalent of the Llandeilo Lime-
stone, but formations of Black River-Chazyan age may be considered as broadly equivalent.
Three conodont faunas of this age have been described. Stauffer (1930, 19354) has
described the fauna of the Decorah Shale and of the Glenwood Beds (1935 a), and Branson
& Mehl (1933) have described that of the Plattin Limestone of Missouri. It should be
emphasized again that these faunas can only be considered as broadly equivalent in age
to that of the Llandeilo.
The following observations may be made on the distribution of genera in these
formations:
(i) The number of genera represented in the Llandeilo fauna is considerably smaller
