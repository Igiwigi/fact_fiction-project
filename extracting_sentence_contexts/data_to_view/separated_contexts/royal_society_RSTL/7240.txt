28. If it were only a question as to the determination of the specific heat of this
naphtha, the method described in the preceding might be advantageously replaced by
another. For by this method the specific heat of the liquid must be found somewhat
too great, owing to the fact that in the empty space in the glass under the stopper a dis-
tinct quantity of yapour is formed, which condenses when the glass is dipped in the
water of the calorimeter (compare ( 25). Direct experiments, in which this forma-
tion of vapour was almost entirely avoided, have shown that the method used for the
previous determinations, that is, the use of glasses for heating the liquid in which a
