We will fix our attention on two salient examples,
the binoxide and tetroxide of nitrogen. As8uming the gaseous densities of these substances as given by various observers to
be the true densities of homogeneous gases, it must be admitted that the ponderable
matter of two units of binoxide of nitrogen is identical with the ponderable matter of
a unit, of nitrogen and a unit of oxygen; and also it must be admitted that the ponder-
able matter of two units of tetroxide of nitrogen 1s identical with the ponderable matter
of a unit of nitrogen and two units of oxygen. The facts here stated are incompatible
with the expression of the symbols of the units of the binoxide of nitrogen and of the
tetroxide of nitrogen respectively by an integral number of prime factors, on the hypo-
thesis that the symbol of hydrogen is expressed as « [Part T. Section VIII. (2)]; for we
cannot find, on that hypothesis, any positive and integral solutions of the indeterminate
equations connecting the integers, which are the indices of the prime factors by which
these symbols are expressed. Now if this be regarded as a true statement of the facts, it must be allowed that the
binoxide and tetroxide of nitrogen are not only (what indeed, perhaps without excep-
tion, they are) the most curious of all chemical substances*, but are absolutely unique
objects not made in the same way as other things, or turned out of the same workshop
with them ; in short (as I before said) they must be © chemical monstrosities,” © lusus
