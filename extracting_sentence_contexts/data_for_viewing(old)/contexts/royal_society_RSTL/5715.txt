Syhich connect the anharmonic ratios. The equation in fact expresses a certain relation

E win four sets (z, 3, y, 3) and four other sets («, BY, 3,); a relation which may
e termed the relation of the homography of the anharmonic ratios of four and four
ts: the notion of this relation is also due to M. CnASLEs.

V 113. The general relation

I 1 & +ÞB ” (3 |=0
Z 1, & +Þ' Q &B'

may be exhibited in a great variety of forms. In fact, if the determinant is denoted by
L, then multiplying by this determinant the two sides of the identical equation

bot —@u, 1 |=(u—v)(v—w)(w—u),
v*, —o, 1
ht —wv, 1
ve obtain
Y{u—v)(v—w)(w—u)=| (u—s (=P ), (v=« No—B ), (w—e Y(w—P ) |
| (u—&)u—P'), (v>e')(v—P'), (we) (w—P')
(u—e")(u—PB"), (v—e")(v—B"), (w—e")(w—P")
