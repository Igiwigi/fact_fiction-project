The aberrations of some contemporary labourers in this field show that it will bear
repetition :—* La premidre chose A faire dans I'ftude d'un animal fossile est de recon-
noitre la forme de ses dents molaires; on d6termine par-la 8'il est carnivore ou herbivore”#,

These test-teeth were fortunately entire in the upper jaw of the skull of ThylacoleoF,
and in the cast of the lower jaw originally describedÞ.

The major part of the molar series was represented by one large and most efficient
carnassial, followed by a single small tubercular above, which was opposed to a semi-
tubercular molar and a second more minute tubercular tooth below. Here was no molar machinery for the mastication of vegetable food, but a maximized
modification of the teeth for the division of fleshy fibre, and 80 much of the tubercular
form added for the final crush or squeeze of gristle or other tough part escaping the
shears, as exists in the most, carnivorous of the placental mammals.

$ 8. Location of Laniaries.—From these facts, with faith in the Cuvierian principle,
I inferred a concomitancy of laniary teeth at the fore part of the jaw © to pierce, retain,
and Kill” the prey, whether such laniaries held the relative position to a suture tech-
nically determining them to be © incisors ”” or © canines.” It is now determined that these
laniaries are, as was inferred in my Second Paper ||, incisors. A co-adapted pair at the
fore part of the lower jaw were opposed to a slightly separated pair in the upper jaw.
