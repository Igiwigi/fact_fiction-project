Wo om dentatum, there can, I think, be little doubt that this is homologous with
1& sImilar body surrounding the c2sophagus of 80 many of the larger marine Nema-
ids, and concerning which both EBrrTy and myself have already expressed our opinions
ut: it does not belong in any way to the nervous system. It differs altogether from the
22ous cgophageal band now distinctly recognized in 80 many Nematoids, not only by
£position, which is often far removed from the mouth, but also by its structure and
Eposition. No fibres can be recognized in its tisswe, it is considerably larger and
wker in 8ize, and, in addition, seems to be connected more intimately with the
z2phagus itself than with the parietes of the body.

Rotwithstanding the existence of well-developed ocelli in many species of free Nema-
2s, both EprrTa and myself have been quite unable to detect any nerve-filaments in
Mmexion with them, or in fact any certain evidence of the presence of a neryous
Zem in these animals. That ch a system does exist I have not the smallest doubt;
nf considering the difficulties besetting its recognition even in large species of parasitic
Enatoids, I think that our failure hitherto in demonstrating its existence in these com-
matively minute animals is after all, notwithstanding their transparency, no very great

Te for wonder.

bave lately, in examining some of these animals with a #” object-glass, detected
Ime almost invisible fibres swrrounding the cegophagus. I have recognized them
stinctly in Monhystera stagnalis. and in Plectus parietinus. In this last species they are
$aated, too, just anterior to the orifice of the ventral gland. I think it very probable
hat this may be its nervous ce80phageal band, but cannot speak more positively on the
