However, this should not be taken
to imply that thinking or even instances of metacognition are
uniformly absent in dreams. Lucid dreams, in which dreamers
realize they are dreaming and often have some degree of con-
trol over the unfolding events, are a good example [51,53];
but even in non-lucid dreams, various types of thinking,
speech and even metacognition occur, often in response to
dream events [113]. The phenomenology of mind wandering has been less well
explored, likely owing to the fact that this is a younger field. Overall, visual imagery and inner speech seem to be the most
common formats, whereas other modalities such as (non-
speech) auditory, tactile or gustatory imagery are comparatively
rare [76]. Some evidence suggests that individual mind wander-
ing episodes tend to involve imagery in just one format and
modality rather than more complex combinations [76].
