P, JOULE AND PROFESSOR THOMSON ON THE

tions of these properties may be made to contribute, along with direct measurements
of the pressure for various particular conditions of the pressure, towards completing
the determination of the function which expresses this element in terms of v and #. But it must be remarked, that even complete obseryations determining the pressure
for every given state of the fluid, could give no information as to the values of # on
the absolute scale, although they might afford data enough for fully expressing p in
terms of the volume and the temperature with reference to some particular snbstance
used thermometrically. On the other band, obseryations on the specific heats of the
fluid, or on the thermal effects it experiences in escaping through narrow passages,
may lead to a knowledge of the absolute temperature, f, of the fluid when in some
known condition, or to the expression of p in terms of v, and absolute values of t ;
and accordingly the formulz (7), (8), and (15) contain # explicitly, each of them in
fact essentially involving Carnor's function. As for actual observations on the specific
heats of air, none which have yet been published appear to do more than illustrate the
theory, by confirming (as Mr. Joure's, and the more precise results more recently
published by M.
