I would here refer to another experiment, described at page 1:6 of my Treatise,
performed with a pile (fig. 6.) of half frogs, from which the upper half of the thigh
had been taken away. In this pile the proper current is in opposition to the muscular
current, for which reason the current obtained is very weak, and sometimes null. I
have till, however, constantly observed that if the frogs employed for this experiment
are very robust, and in those conditions which we have seen to be fayourable to the
proper current, the signs of a current which this pile gives, though always very weak,
are in favour of the proper current ; while, on the contrary, when the frogs are taken
in the conditions unfayourable to the proper current, the slight current which this
pile gives are in fayour of the muscular current.

From the sum of these facts I am again forced to conclude, as I was led by my
former experiments to do, that the proper and the muscular current are in general
subjected to the same laws, and that both these currents vary in the same sense,
under the same circumstances.

But why should the proper current belong exclusively to the frog ? This is the
problem the solution of which I had long been anxious to arrive at, and hope finally
to have given a satisfactory explanation,
