Its periodic motion
along the closed orbit itself is regarded as an unperturbed motion to start with. Admittedly, no
analytical solution of such a general oscillation is available. Historically, this fact might have
worked as an obstacle to hitting on the idea that this intractable mathematical object can still
be chosen as the starting point of a perturbation theory of reduction. This may partly explain the
reason why the appearance of the phase reduction theory is relatively new compared, e.g. with
the asymptotic theory of weakly nonlinear oscillations.

(a) Definition of phase

Let the time-periodic solution of X = F(X) with frequency w be given by a 27-periodic function
x(¢), where the phase ¢ varies as ¢ = wt + . The initial phase w is an arbitrary constant.
