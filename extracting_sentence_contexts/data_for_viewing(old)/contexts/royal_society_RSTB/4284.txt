The Bolling-curve.

The curves for boll production per plant, expressed by the number of ripe bolls
per plant per day in each weekly period, are plotted in fig. 5 from the data in
Tables XXI-XL of Appendix I.

They do not present many new features, being identical with the flowering-curves
from which they were derived, as to their form, but differing in amplitude. The
difference is due to the shedding of about 40 per cent. of the flowers after they
have opened. This difference is practically constant throughout all varieties of
cotton in any part of Egypt, though some suffer more in the south, where it is
hotter. The fact that all spacings are equally affected has a direct bearing on our
former conclusion, that the automatic self-regulation of the plant is sufficient to
compensate for the different environmental conditions. It also indicates that the
cause of this comparative constancy in shedding is one which acts at regular intervals
over a short period, and there can be little doubt that the condition of water-strain
which occurs every afternoon is this cause.

Although the average amount of shedding in good cultivation is practically constant,
there are fluctuations from the average with which we shall deal later.

That there should be such a marked resemblance between the curves of flowering
and of bolling is important in the analysis of yield, since it indicates that flowering
is the principal determinant ; and since flowering in its turn can be traced back to
