foot, or a foot (which are the errors most likely to occur), without the trouble
of bringing the instrument and adjusting it two distinet times at the same
spot. The mean of the four and the mean of the two observations ought of
course to make 10,000 *. In the detail of the proof-levels, the correction for
curvature is additive instead of subtractive; and in fact the whole operation
is reversed, + standing for â€”.

In the course of my levellings, having instruments not generally used, I
made some few notes, which I take leave here to transcrihe.

In adjusting the station-staff, it is difficult to know when the zero on the

vane is made to coincide with the horizontal wire of the telescope. I have
found the most convenient and correct mode to be, to observe
with the wire forming a diagonal to the lines on the vane, by
which, when the staff is near, the two small black lines at
each end of the vane could be seen; and when the vane was
