But after some weeks of labour,
T found myself in secure possession. of the result that gases and vapours exhibited, in
Telation to radiant heat, phenomena far more surprising than those observed by
Merzoxt in liquids and solids. On the 26th of May 1859 the subject was brought
Dpfore the Royal Society,* and on the 10th of June I was able, by illuminating the
Yal of a galvanometer and casting its image upon a screen, to demonstrate in the
Boyul Institution not only the fact of absorption, but the astonishing differences of
zhsorption which gases and vapours equally transparent to light manifested in regard
© radiant heat.f
DThe following gases and vapours were then examined:—Air, oxygen, hydrogen,
Ftrogen, carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, nitrous oxide, coal gas, ammonia, olefiant gas,
Ezulphide of carbon, chloroform, benzol, iodide of ethyl, cyanide of ethyl, formate of
#hyl, acetate of ethyl, propionate of ethyl, iodide of amyl, chloride of amyl, amyline,
olute alcohol, amylic alcohol, methylic alcohol, ethylic ether, ethylamylic ether,
phuric ether, and some others. In the Philosophical Magazine for 1862 I have
Sven samples of the results obtained with a few of these substances ; and I will here
wnfine myself to the remark that were the measurements there recorded multiplied a
Bindred-fold, they would fall far short of the number actually executed in 1859. Z With a view of compelling the feeblest gases and vapours to show, if they possessed
E their capacity to absorb radiant heat, the * method of compensation” was invented.f
Without prejudice to the delicacy of the galvanometer, this method enabled me to
ing into play quantities of heat far greater than those ever previously invoked, my
Diject being 80 to exalt the total radiation that a minute fraction of that total should
Sveal itself to experiment.
