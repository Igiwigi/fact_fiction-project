and connected them with the well-known Carboniferous
plants called Sigillarie. The conclusions thus arrived at by the great French paleontologist were almost
universally accepted at the «ime when I began my investigations into these subjects,
some thirty years ago ; I soon obtained clear proofs that many of the Carboniferous
Cryptogams, unlike their lying representatives, were provided with a secondary,
exogenously-developed, vascular zone. “That this is the case with most of Brone-
nrArt’s Lepidodendra is now an almost universally accepted fact. But these plants
vary ina very remarkable manner as to the stage of growth at which this secondary
development makes its appearance. In some, like the L. selaginoides, it exists in very
young twigs.
