If a current be s0 directed that it may act chemically in one part
of its course, and magnetically in another, the two actions are always found to
take place together. A current has not, to my knowledge, been produced which
could act chemically and not magnetically, nor any which can act on the
magnet, and not af the same time chemically *,

sidering the influence which is present in what we call the electric current, —
whether in metals or fused bodies or humid conductors, or even in air, flame,

also fail to be currents,

never been resolved into simpler or elementary influences, and may perhaps
best be conceived of as an avis of power having contrary forces, exactly equal
in amount, in contrary directions.
