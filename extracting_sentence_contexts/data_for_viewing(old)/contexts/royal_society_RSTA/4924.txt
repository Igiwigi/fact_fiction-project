(b) Structure of coronal loops

What can the three-dimensional MHD models tell us about the formation of coronal loops? By
synthesizing the coronal emission, one can locate the exact position of a given loop at any given
time, and using the output from the MHD model, one can then study why that particular loop
appeared and why it looks the way it does.

One of the puzzling questions on loops concerns their diameter and constant cross section.
Observations show that loops in EUV and in X-rays have a roughly constant cross section [104,
105], and that this diameter seems to be of the order of 1.5-2 Mm for isolated loops [103,106]. So
modelling is confronted to explain not only the constant cross section, but also their finite width.
The constant cross section seems to contradict the fact that the magnetic field is expanding, and
the finite width raises the question as to what fundamental width across the magnetic field would
determine this.


Even in a potential field extrapolation, where in general the magnetic field expands with | |
height, the constant cross section could be an artefact of the observing geometry because the

shape of a magnetic (flux) tube varies along the loop [107]. However, then at some places one
should see also strong expansion, which does not seem to be the case.

In a three-dimensional MHD model, the shape of the resulting loop in coronal emission
depends not only on the magnetic field structure, but also on the thermal properties (temperature
