We would draw attention to the fact that our results for cane sugar, where they
overlap those obtained by Messrs. Morse and Fraser,t are somewhat higher. For
instance, a solution containing 282 grammes in the litre is given by them as having
an equilibrium pressure of 22°49 atmospheres, while we obtain 25 atmospheres, this
value being taken from the curve.

There seems to be no mention in Messrs. Morse and Fraser’s account of their
work of any steps taken to determine the amount of solution which came through the
membranes. A small “solution leak” would make a considerable difference to the
pressure they obtained, not so much on account of “back” osmotic pressure, but
because the passage of a small volume of solution would have a large effect on the
level of the mercury in the manometer, the more so as the diameter of the latter is
only 0°5 millim. and it is a closed one. The general excellence of their work, however,
