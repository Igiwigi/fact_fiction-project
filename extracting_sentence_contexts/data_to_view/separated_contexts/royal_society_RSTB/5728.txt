would be entirely self-consistent, were it not for the specimens 280 and 442. Of these

tissue is present. In 442 the grafted piece was extensively injured during the operation
and the failure to form neural tissue may be due to this fact. Thus, from the grafts recorded in the table, it might be possible to argue that the
anterior end of the primitive streak always formed neural tissue if conditions were
favourable, while the posterior end never did. The varying results obtained with
middle thirds would then depend solely on whether they extended far enough anteriorly
to include any of the presumptive medullary material.
