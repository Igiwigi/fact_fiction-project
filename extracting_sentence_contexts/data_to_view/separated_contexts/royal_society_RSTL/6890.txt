40, i) in a direction from within outwards

Z certain fibres from the upper third of the second layer of the septum and left ventricle
S posteriorly, a third portion (e”) pursuing a similar course to unite with the fibres from
& the upper third of the third layer of the septum and from the left ventricle. If that
surface of the dependent or free leaf of the valve which is directed towards the right
& ventricular wall be examined, a fourth portion (4) is found to be continuous with the
E fibres of the upper third of the fourth or transverse layer. The muscular valve of the
S bird may therefore be said to be composed of the fibres entering into the formation of
= the several layers of the right ventricular wall, (the ventricular wall in fact bifurcates
8 or Splits up towards its base,) the external layers forming the outer wall of the valve,
the internal layers, which are slightly modified, forming the inner. It is to this splitting
up of the right ventricular wall towards the base (Plate XIV. fig.
