We have no reason however
to think the experiments on this day less trustworthy than others, as none of the
precautions usually taken to ensure accuracy were neglected. Defective insulation ab
the needles, involving a deviation of the circuit, would have resulted in an increased
and nob a diminished value of the thickness. The fact that Film I. of the same date
yielded the value 12:53, which does not differ much from the mean of the others,
precluded the possibility that a different liquid had by some mischance been used. The number 12:53, however, had been derived from a single observation, and hence
might appear to be less trustworthy than the others. To set all doubt on this point
ab rest, the 8pecific resistance of the liquid used was without delay redetermined, and
was, as was expected, found to be normal.
