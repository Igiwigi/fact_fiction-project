Their peculiarly intimate
relation to the blood capillaries seems to indicate, as I suggested in my former paper,
that they serve as repositories for certain matters absorbed by the blood from the
chyme as it passes over the intestinal surface ; these matters are however, doubtless,
altered by the recipient cells and converted into sugar, perhaps also into oil or biliary
matter. It is clearly proved that sugar is made in the liver, that it is not found in the blood
entering the liver by the vena porta, but that it exists in very large quantity in the
blood passing out by the hepatic vein; the substance also of the liver, the parenchyma,
contains abundance of sugar, as I have repeatedly observed. These facts: show that
one, and probably the chief function, of the hepatic cells is to elaborate sugar from
the materials intended to be employed in respiration ; and that having done 80, they
allow this product to return into the circulating fluid, where it perhaps undergoes
further changes before it terminates in carbonic acid. The parenchyma of the liver
thus resembles closely a ductless gland, such as the suprarenal capsule, allowing its

* To this the liver of a fatted pig presents a remarkable exception ; its cells seem inapt to receive the oil
which 80 accumulates in the subcutaneous tissue.
