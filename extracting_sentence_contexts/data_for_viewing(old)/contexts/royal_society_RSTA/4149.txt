complex valued fit properly fits the individual real and imaginary parts of the fidelity amplitude.

(c) Coupling of an additional ‘closed’ channel

For the two cases, where the antenna is terminated by a reflecting hard wall or an open end, we
may assume a = 0, resulting in «rp = tanh(ig7/2) =itan gr/2, and

H%, =H +tan (3) kwWrWt. (6.4)

el

Here the coupling is purely real and the antenna does not correspond any longer to an open
channel but only to a scattering centre. In fact, this interpretation is true only as long as the
absorption in the antenna can really be neglected. This becomes questionable, as soon as yr
