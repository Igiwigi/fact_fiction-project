functions of 8, and â€”=0 + 2 a, suffices to determine 0.

If we suppose C and C' to represent the extreme red and
violet rays, it is evident that the coincidence of the extra=
ordinary pencils-of the same order for these two extremes,
will ensure that of the intermediate ones, at least very nearly.
It would do $0 precisely, were the value of 9 for any inter-
mediate ray, such a function of k as would result from mak-
ing 6 constant in the preceding equation, because the two
laws, that of the dispersion of the axes, and that of the magni-
tude of the rings of different colours, would then act in exact
opposition to each other throughout their whole extent. It
is, in fact, a case precisely analogous to that of the compound
achromatic prism, where if the law of dispersion in the -one
medium were identical with that in the other, a perfectly
colourless pencil would emerge, and when these laws differ,
the coincidence of the red and violet rays ensures an approxi-
mate coincidence of all the rest. Should these laws however
differ very considerably, an uncorrected colour will appear
at the point s0 determined, and a nearer approximation will
be obtained by uniting two of the more powerful intermediate
rays, such as for instance the mean red and the blue, or
limit of the green and blue.

This then is the origin of the virtual poles or points be-
