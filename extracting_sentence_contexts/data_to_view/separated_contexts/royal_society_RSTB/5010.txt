The other orders of Paleozoic Amphibia are still very imperfectly known; but
there is some evidence to show that the Lepospondyli and Phyllospondyli exhibit similar
evolutionary trends to those which we have just established for the Labyrinthodontia ;
and that at any given period the members of these two orders are of more advanced
structure than the Labyrinthodonts. We can therefore accept the Embolomeri as the most primitive of all Amphibia, and
those which must most nearly resemble the fish ancestors of that class. The fact that the evolutionary trends which we have been considering pass onward
unchanged from the Embolomeri, through the Rachitomi to the Stereospondyli, whilst
the habits of the animals concerned change froma primarily aquatic through a terrestrial
to a secondarily aquatic mode of life, suggests that they are not induced by any external
environmental conditions but have their origin within the animal’s body, and owe
their constancy of direction to the mechanism which determines the characters of the
adult being so constructed as to be capable of modification only in certain definite
ways. The interest of this conclusion is much enhanced by the occurrence of similar trends
in other orders, even the Urodela, which differ in many respects from other Amphibia
showing traces of their presence. The extremely close resemblance between the Dipnoi and the Urodela, a resemblance
covering the respiratory and circulating systems, the urogenital apparatus, the brain,
the skull, the histology and the embryology throughout, indicates them as the first fishes
to be considered in the search for Amphibian ancestors.
