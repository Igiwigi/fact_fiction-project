Looking northward, numerous parallel spurs project
into the valley from the eastern plateau; the dip in the spurs seen to the N. from
Wei-si is to the E., whereas in the hills H. of Wei-si the prevalent dips are N. or 8. from
an upfold with an axis trending approximately E. and W.

The general evidence observed during the traverse from Chi-tien to Wei-si may be
summarised as follows : the rocks of the Ta-li series, seen along the Yangtze Kiang, rest
upon schists and gneisses, upon which, in the hills E. of Wei-si, lie remnants of the
Minchia Series ; this series has been intruded by various porphyries and some felsite. GEOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF CHINESE TIBET, ETC. 195

We saw no direct evidence of the intrusion of the granite into the Minchia Series, but
only into the older schists and gneiss; but that the granite also is post-Minchia is
probable from the evidence seen farther to the N.

$6. The Ying-an River to the Mekong,

Amongst other evidence of great changes in the river system of this region is the fact
that many of the tributaries flow northward, in the direction opposite to that of the
river which they join. Thus, the Ying-an River rises near a windgap 8.8.E. of Wei-si,
flows past that town and reaches the Mekong after a northward flow in a direct line of
25 miles. At Wei-si a broad valley separates tae high gneiss range to the W. and the
hills formed of the Minchia Series and igneous rocks near the Li-ti-ping.
