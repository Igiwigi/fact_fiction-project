The IIoT platform allows the integration of third-party equipment, e.g. working with
CNC equipment provided by other manufacturers, given that this equipment has the adequate
process interface, special connectors that work e.g. with their web-interfaces. A physical object to be manufactured in the cyber-physical platform is called here ‘smart
product/smart workpiece’. As a matter of fact, the smartness of the product consists in this
research project of the capability of the physical object to provide the operator of equipment,
the production supervisors, the maintenance technicians, the production managers, and all
components of the platform (on all three levels) with real-time (current) data and information
necessary for performing decision-making processes and their functionality, at the corresponding
phase of the product, production system and production process life cycles. Such an object is first identified at the entry point into the ICPS. As a part of this operation,
the object receives a tag through which it acquires a digital identity.
