together the lateral and admedian spines. This bone bears a well-defined ornament of
tubercles. The admedian spine, exceedingly wide and powerful, is firmly held for three-
quarters of its length by this dermal bone, and its admedian border also is surrounded
by dermal bone which appears to be continuous with that which is interposed between
the two spines. Finally, the shoulder girdle is completed by a pair of elements which
seem to articulate both with the dorsal shoulder girdle and with the ventral dermal
element surrounding the base of the admedian spine, and are themselves connected by
some form of sutural union. It seems probable that these bones lay on the ventral
surface because in specimen P. 299 they are continued forward by a triangular patch
of large scales. These anterior elements which meet in the middle line are hollow and
filled with clear crystalline calcite; in other words they are presumably perichondral
bone laid down round a coracoid cartilage. The whole arrangement is unique and
extraordinarily difficult to determine. The essential facts, however, are that the lateral-
fin spine is firmly clasped between two independent bones; the admedian spine is
inserted into a slot in one of these; and there is a third ventral element which

articulates with the other two. No supporting elements are to be seen in association
with any of the other paired fins. The specimen Powrie 1891, 92, 334 shows a series
of ceratotrichia associated with the pectoral fin.
