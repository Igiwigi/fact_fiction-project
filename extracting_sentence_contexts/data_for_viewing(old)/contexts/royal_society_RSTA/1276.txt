is the free energy of the liquid crystal molecules. Here, we denoted with fg def —(a/2)
tr(Q?) — (b/3)tr(Q5) + (c/4)(tr(Q?))? the bulk potential and by 8FipG/IQ = —LAQ — aQ — b[Q? —
(tr(Q*)/3)Id] + cQtr(Q?) the variational derivative within So. The L,a,b,c constants are specific to
the material with L> 0 anda,beR, c>0.


If u=0 the Q-tensor equation would simply be a gradient flow of the free energy. For u 4 0,
the molecules are transported by the flow (as indicated by the convective derivative D;) as well
as being tumbled and aligned by the flow, a fact described by the term:

def

S(Vu, Q) = (D+ 2) (2 t si) t (2 t 5) (ED — 2) —2& (2+ si) tr(QVu), (2.3)
where D def 1/2(Vu + (Vu)") and 2 det 1/2(Vu — (Vu)") are, respectively, the symmetric part and
the antisymmetric part, of the velocity gradient matrix Vu. The constant é is a material dependent
constant, the case = 0 being referred to as the co-rotational case.
The equations for the flow u resulting out of the linear momentum conservation satisfy the
forced Navier-Stokes system:
Ou + (u-Viu=vAu+ Vp+av-T
