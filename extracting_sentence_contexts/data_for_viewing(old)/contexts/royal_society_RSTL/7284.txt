this amount is by the hypothesis proportional to the quantity of substance remaining ; 80
that we have the equation

which gives

y=ae,

where @ is the quantity of substance at the commencement of the change.

This equation expresses the fact that the quantities of substance remaining after a
series of interyals of time increasing in arithmetical progression, form a series in geome-
trical progression. After the intervals 0, 1, 2, 3, ... minutes, the quantities of substance
remaining are

a geometric series of which the ratio is 6%. The curve which expresses this relation
between & and y is a logarithmic curve.

As the actual determinations of the oxidizing residue had been made at equal inter-
vals of time, it was an easy matter to test the applicability of this hypothesis. It
appeared that although these numbers were in most cases nearly in geometrical pro-
