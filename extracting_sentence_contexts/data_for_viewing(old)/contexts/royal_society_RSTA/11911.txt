ROTATION OF THE PLANE OF POLARIZATION OF LIGHT IN LIQUIDS. 635

irection or in the other through these two layers of fine wire. If the intensity
he illumination of the two halves of the field is the same, on making and reversing
current, the one half and then the other is darkened to the same extent. In each
ing the position of the analyzer was adjusted until on using the auxiliary current
in the manner described, each half of the field appeared to be equally darkened. In
this way the eyes do not seem to be strained so much as in the ordinar ‘y method of
king the settings. Other points which help in the same direction are the mode of
luminating the scales of the verniers and the thermometers to which reference has
eady been made, and the fact that in a series of observations the observers took
wns at making the settings.
With high double rotations, such as 30° or 40°, we were much troubled, to begin
h, by bright patches, which appeared in the field of view, and prevented the .
justment of the two halves to equal intensity. This effeet was found to be due to
t, which, having suffered reflection at the far end of the tube, traversed the liquid
second time, was again reflected from one or other of the glass surfaces which closed

the jacket or the cell containing the quartz plate, and finally reached the analyzer,
Baving traversed the liquid three times. Its plane of polarization was therefore
Eptated through an angle three times as great as that of the light which had only
