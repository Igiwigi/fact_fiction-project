They imply that a naive interpretation
of the fluid equations (2.1) as partial differential equations is no longer possible when Re — oo. As in quantum field theory and critical phenomena, the development of a valid dynamical
description in that limit requires a regularization of these divergences [24]. Regularizing by a
suitable ‘coarse-graining’ operation, the resulting regularized dynamics in fact corresponds to
what in mathematics is called a weak formulation of the fluid equations: see [46], §2 or [25]. In this
formulation, one may pass to the limit Re oo and, under physically reasonable assumptions
consistent with observations, the limits (along suitable subsequences) exist and are described as
weak Euler solutions [47], in agreement with the ideas of Taylor and Onsager. In the following
section, we explain in physical terms the regularization that has been employed in the recent
mathematical literature on wall-bounded flows [1-4] and explore its consequences.
