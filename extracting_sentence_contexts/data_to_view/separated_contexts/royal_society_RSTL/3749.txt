Each vellzl was placed immediately upon the
window ; and it was obſerved that the blood in the
firſt was lateſt in coagulating, and had a cruſt over
the whole ſurface; that in the ſecond, had a.cruſt
only upon a part of its ſurface; but that in the third
and fourth had no cruſt, and manifeſtly coagulated
before: either of the other two. From theſe experiments it is evident, that the
properties of the coagulable lymph can be ſoon
changed; ſince, in the ſpace of three or four mi-
nutes, the diſpoſition to coagulate was increaſed, and
probably too the lymph was thickened. It might
indeed, at firſt ſight, ſeem poſſible, that blood-letting
had only let out the vitiated part ; but this is highly
improbable ; for, ſuppoſe a part only of the blood
was vitiated, that part muſt have been equally diffuſed
through the whole maſs, and there is no likelihood
of its getting out of the veſſels beſore the reſt of the
blood ; and conſequently it ought to have appeared in
thelaſt equally as in the firſt cup, but it did not, Bleed-
ing, therefore, in thoſe caſes alters the nature of the
blood, not by removing the vitiated part, and giving
room for new blood to be formed, as has been
ſuſpe&ed ; but probably by changing that ſtate of
the blood-veſſels on which the thinneſs, and lefſened
tendency of the lymph to coagulation, depends ;
which ſurely is a very curious circumftance, This

fad is the more remarkable, fince it ſhews the im-
probability of the opinions of thoſe who maintain,
that this vitiated blood is the cauſe of the diſeaſe,
fince the diſeaſe remained, though the properties of
the blood were changed *. From this obſervation we may be led to think,
that it may be'uſeful to receive the blood more fre-
quently into ſmall cups, inſtead of a baſon, and to
attend more carefully to the alteratior” produced
upon it by bleeding ; as we may by that means per-
haps learn to determine better, what quantities
ſhould be taken away in particular caſes, For it
would ſeem probable that the operation is likely to
have the moſt effe& on the diſeaſe,. in thoſe caſes
where the greateſt change is produced by its means,
on the diſpoſition of the blood to coagulate ; and of
that change, we can judge, by comparing the blood
in the firſt cup, with that in the laft ; for the fiſt
cup will nearly ſhew the ſtate of the blood at the be-
ginning ; and the Jaſt cup the ſtate of the blood at
the latter part of the evacuation,

It frequently happens, that inſtead of an inflam-
matory cruſt over the whole ſurface of the crafſamen=
Zum, there is only a partial one, which appears in large
ſpots or ſtreaks. In ſuch caſes I haye obſerved, that

proportion as the yeſlels were emptied, and as the animal became
weaker, It may likewiſe be neceflary to mention, that though
the inference is here drawn from two experiments only, yet I
have likewiſe obſerved the ſame appearance in other caſes, which
I have thought'it unneceſſary to relate,
