cranially, lies within a venous lake is another feature of interest, which probably has
a physiological significance. The reason why some species have a carotid rete while others
do not is not at all obvious, and the fact that even in those species in which a rete is
present the vessels which supply it are not the same (e.g. the cat, the sheep, and the
pig) makes the problem still more complex. Not the least of the peculiarities which has
to be explained is the presence of a carotid rete in species so diverse in their habits as
Felidae and Artiodactyla. Much more information is required from comparative ana-
tomical and physiological studies before a satisfactory explanation for the existence of the
rete is forthcoming.
