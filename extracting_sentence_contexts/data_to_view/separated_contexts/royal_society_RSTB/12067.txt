Conversely, higher levels of the hormone
induce the cleavage of Atg5 and impair the Atg5—-Atg12
conjugation process, thus switching to apoptosis [55]. A final consideration concerns the PI3K/Akt pathway,
which plays an important role in regulating a number of cel-
lular processes, such as cell proliferation, cell survival, cell
death, signal transduction and protein synthesis, and which
may also deserve attention as a potential point of interaction
between autophagy and apoptosis. This signalling pathway
in fact represents the mediator that leads to the activation
of autophagy at metamorphosis via nutrient signals and hor-
mones, at least in the larval fat body [5]. Furthermore, a
recent study has reported that the expression of apoptosis-
related genes, such as caspases, during the spinning period
is regulated by PI3K/Akt, suggesting a possible role of this
signalling pathway in activating apoptosis in the posterior
silk gland of B. mori, too [80]. However, further investigation
is needed to confirm this hypothesis for the PI3K/Akt path-
way and, hopefully, to characterize the putative regulatory
mechanism.
