The criterion is expressed as a limiting value of a non-dimensional quantity akin to
the quantity Vd/v which we have taken as the “* ReyNoups’ number ” of our problem.
Numbers of this kind are known from experiment to be criteria of critical velocity in
all cases where instability has been found to oceur; and ReyNoups seems to have
concluded from this fact that his calculations had some bearing on the basic question
of stability.

The application of ReyNotps’ method to our problem was made by H. A. Lorentz,
who obtained the limiting figure 288 for Vd/v, taking as his assumed disturbance
a species of “ elliptic whirls.”

11. But if the type is chosen arbitrarily (as in these investigations), the rate at which
the integral is found to increase will as a matter of fact afford no indication of stability
or instability. As remarked by G. I. Tayuor§: “It does not determine an upper
limit to the speed of flow which must be stable, because some other type of disturbance
might exist which would increase initially at a lower speed of the fluid. Neither does it
determine a lower limit to the speeds at which the flow must be unstable, because the
assumed disturbance which initially increases might decrease indefinitely at some
later stage of the motion.”

Orr’s Extension of the Method.

12. A considerable improvement in method has been effected by ORR, who employed
the calculus of variations to find that type of disturbance in which, for the least value
of 8, the kinetic energy integral can be momentarily stationary. In this way he
