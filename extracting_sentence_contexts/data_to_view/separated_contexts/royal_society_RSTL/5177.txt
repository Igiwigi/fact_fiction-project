Before I was aware that albuminous
matter produced with sugar and sulphuric acid the saine reaction as bile, I conceived
that I had found certain proof of the presence of biliary matter in the cells by applying
this test to a thin slice of liver and watching the changes under the microscope ;
under the action of the acid the tissxue became much more translucent, and developed
along its margin a beautiful permanent crimson tint. The very same however, even
more intense, was produced by treating a section of kidney in a similar way, so that
it was manifest the reaction depended on nothing special to the liver. One other fact we may receive from chemistry, which is also corroborative of the
view that the sugar and bile are not produced in the same parts, viz. that the bile
does not contain the hepatic sugar. M. Bernarv distinctly states this, and on
repeating the experiment I obtained the same result.
