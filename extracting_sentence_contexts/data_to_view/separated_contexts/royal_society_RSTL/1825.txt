purposes, would keep an accumulation of the proper powers
in store, which, in the case of the cuckoo and swift, would be
entirely useless. Whether there be a regular gradation in the size of the testes
(that of the bird itself being considered), throughout the whole
race, in proportion to the time taken up in pairing, I cannot
determine, not having had an opportunity of subjecting the
matter to a full investigation. However, I thought the fact
already shown of sufficient importance in natural history, to
be worthy of communication, as it forms a kind of sequel to
Mr. HuNTrR's paper on the subject. With due deference to the late Dr. Darwin, I am inclined
to think that the opinion he set forth respecting the pairing
of cuckoos, was taken up hastily, and that the birds which
his friend saw were not cuckoos feeding their nestlings, but
goat-suckers, whose mode of nesting corresponds with the
relation given, and whose appearance might be mistaken for
them by one not perfectly conversant with the plumage and
the general appearance of cuckoos when on the wing. Is it
probable that the cuckoo, which is invariably a polygamist,
and never pairs, nests, or incubates in this part of the island,
should fall into opposite habits in another part ?
