istence of exhalant arteries with open mouths, which in the secreting glands opened
directly into the excretory canals. It is probable that this accurate observer mistook
the efferent vessel of the Malpighian body for a uriniferous tube, for the efferent
vessels of those Malpighian bodies that lie near the medullary part of the kidney, take
the same course as the tubes, and are often large enough to be readily mistaken for
them. The statement, however, of Ruyscn and othersf, that the tubes may be in-
Jected from the arteries, is true, though in a different sense from that in which they
understood it.

ScnumLansky 4, some years afterwards, entertained more complete views of the
connection between these bodies and the uriniferous tubes, and he has even given an
ideal diagram of this connection, which shows that he had a very clear conception of
the fact. From a considerable error, however, in the proportion of these bodies to
the tubes (represented in his figure), it has been suggested that his description could
not have been drawn from nature; a censure that seems to have been little merited.

spicuous for the sterling accuracy of its observations than for the sagacity displayed in the reasonings based on
them.
