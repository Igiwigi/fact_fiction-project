sponding o-chloro-p-nitrophenol reveals approximately a 20-

fold difference in affinity, probably owing to the loss of hydro-
gen bonding interactions with the acetic acid moiety. Within the
p-nitrophenol series, there is a clear trend between atomic
radius of the o-substituent and the corresponding apparent
Kg. An approximately sevenfold difference between o-methyl-

pnitrophenol and p-nitrophenol reveals that atomic radius contributions made by each amino acid to the phenolate-
