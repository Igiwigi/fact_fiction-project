place of origin is, however, different, and will be referred to below. Soon after this
the first leaf becomes recognisable from the outside, and a bud consisting of several
leaves surrounding the stem apex is formed before any trace of a root is visible.
The origin of the latter member has not been observed in the examples investigated.
Sometimes, in addition to the bud arising as a continuation of the apex of the
process, another may be produced laterally, or two buds of similar size may form
side by side on the tip.

Returning to the earliest stage, fig. 6 represents part of a section in the direction
of the dotted line in fig. 5, including the apex of the sporophyte. â€˜The most striking
feature of the section is the definite though irregular line of demarcation between
the cells of the process and the tissue of the sporophyte. The contrast depends
mainly on the fact that the sporophyte tissue consists of small cells of meristematic
appearance, while the cells of the prothallus have large vacuoles and thicker walls,
which stain deeply with Bismarck brown. Occupying the apex an initial cell of the
usual form is seen, and the succession of cell walls shows that segmentation proceeds

as in the apex of a fern stem. In a central position and separated from the

sporophyte tissue, which it resembles in all respects, is a small group of cells. Other
sections of the series showed that at one point this group was continuous with the
main mass of sporophytic tissue, and that some of its cells had developed into
