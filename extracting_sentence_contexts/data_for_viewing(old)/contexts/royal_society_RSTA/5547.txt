accumulate and electric double layers form, are likely to play a key role in the response of IPMCs.
However, these interfaces are hard to probe experimentally or through macroscopic theoretical
and computational approaches, due to their small thickness, in the range of 0.1-100 nm [13].

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a viable approach for modelling IPMCs at the
atomistic scale, as they allow the researcher to track the motion of individual atoms in sufficiently
large structures. Despite the considerable number of MD simulations on bare ionomers without
electrodes [14-18], atomistic-level models of IPMCs remain untapped. While previous literature
includes simulations of composites comprising ionomers with random nanocarbon inserts [19],
no model examined sandwich-like composite structures such as IPMCs. Moreover, due to the
extensive use of ionomers as proton-exchange membranes in hydrogen fuel cells, most of the
literature has focused on protons, that is, hydronium counterions [14,17], rather than metal
ions [20-22] which are of greater interest for IPMCs. In fact, protons produce much smaller forces
in IPMC actuators than metal ions or small organic molecules [7].

Further, the effect of an external electric field has received limited attention [23-30]. These
efforts mostly considered the effect of an external electric field on the ionomer structure
and properties, under the premise of fully periodic ionomer membranes. These simplified
configurations, however, bear limited practical value in the study of IPMC physics. Allahyarov
and Taylor [23] studied morphological changes of polymeric backbones upon application of
electric field with coarse-grained MD, showing the formation of a topology that favours
