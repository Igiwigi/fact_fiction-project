On account of the
shift of the growing-point, the distances of points in the diagram from the old and the
new growing-points are represented by their distances from the lines B A B and BtA1B!
respectively. The amount of shift of the growing-point is represented by the distance
A A? or B B!, which is the distance between the above two lines at 0° and 180°. Since
