He concludes
that in the general course of evolution as illustrated by this group there is a gradual
regression and final disappearance from the skull of the foramen for the twelfth nerve,
an increase in the size of the interpterygoid vacuities and of the parasphenoidal
rostrum, a replacement of the basi-pterygoid processes of the basi-sphenoid by
expansions of the parasphenoid and exoccipital, a reduction and final disappearance of
the basi-occipital, basi-sphenoid and supra-occipital bones. If this should prove to truly represent the general trend of evolution, especially as
it affects the expansion of the parasphenoid, it might be possible to derive the
Urodeles, as Moopte has done, from the Branchiosauria, though no support to this view
is afforded by Lysorophus. For the fruitful discussion of these problems we need more facts. Much may be
revealed by further study of the Devonian fishes, now being so successfully investi-
gated by Goopricu, Watson, and Day,* and we look forward with hope to a time
when the internal anatomy of these forms will be as fully exposed as that of
Lysorophus.
