In practice such conditions will but rarely occur, because, as is well known, any
slight difference in the height of the supports, or in the manner in which the beam
bears upon them, will upset the symmetry altogether.

The ultimate step in the process of thinning down the boundary conditions is taken
when one of the two boundaries of the infinite plate is itself removed to infinity,
leaving only one plane bounding an otherwise unlimited solid.

This problem also has been solved by Lami and Ciarryron (loc. cit.) in terms of
quadruple integrals. In this case the limiting conditions at infinity cease to be
important, because, in a solid infinite in three dimensions, finite stresses are not
transmitted undiminished from infinity, as in a rod or lamina. ‘The solutions, in
fact, will lead to stresses that become zero at infinity. This has been shown by
Bousstnesg (‘ Applications des Potentiels 4 l’Etude de l’Equilibre et du Mouvement
des Solides Elastiques,’ Paris, GAUTHTER-VILLARS, 1885), who has interpreted Lami
and CLApEyRon’s results, and obtained by a new method simple expressions for the
stresses in an infinite solid, due to arbitrary surface forces applied to a bounding
plane. The same results have been obtained by Professor Crrrutt (“ Ricerche
intorno all’ Equilibrio de Corpi Elastici Isotropi,” ‘Reale Accademia dei Lincei,’
vol. 13, 1881-2) in a different way.

BoussIvEsQ, on p. 280, suggests a possible application of his method to the case
of two parallel planes, but he makes no attempt to follow it up.
