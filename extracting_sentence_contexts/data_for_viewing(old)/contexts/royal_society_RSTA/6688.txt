Since the lattices A” have bounded determinants, and each has only a bounded number
of points in H, it follows (by Mahler 1946a, theorem 2 and its proof) that this sequence of
lattices contains a convergent subsequence A”, A, ... such that also each sequence of
points Py”, Py, ..., etc., is convergent. Denote the limiting lattice by A, and the limiting
points by P,, ..., Po,4;, where P, is not O. The lattice A has exactly 2k+-1 points in K(,
and these are arbitrarily near to P,, ..., Po).

t This body corresponds to F(x,, x2) = max (—%, x», x, x»/k).

We now use the fact that K has automorphisms which transform any point other than O
into points arbitrarily far from O. Let Q be a particular automorphism of K such that the
point QP, is outside H. Then, provided 7; is sufficiently large, the lattice QA” has a point
QP outside H, and also, by the hypothesis of the induction, has at least 2k+-1 points in H.
But now the lattice A® has at least 2k+-1 points in the bounded body Q-'H, and has two
additional points +P) in K, If r; is sufficiently large, K°? contains Q-'H, and so A’?
has at least 2k +3 points in K*, contrary to supposition. This contradiction establishes the
induction from k to k+1, and so completes the proof of lemma 1.

LemMA 2. Suppose that K is a fully automorphic and boundedly reducible star body, and let k be
a positive integer. Then there is a bounded star body H,, contained in K such that, if A is a lattice with
determinant A<A(K), then there are at least 2k-+-1 points of A in H,,.
