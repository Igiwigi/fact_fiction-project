8. Sources of Error. Different photographs, obtained exactly in the same way, sometimes differ con-
siderably in the value they give for the molecular velocity, and there is little doubt
that the chief cause of error lies in the fact that the discharge is not a straight line
parallel to the slit, but takes place in irregular curves, and, as appears already on
Dr. Feppersenâ€™s photographs, the successive oscillations of the same discharge take
sometimes very different courses. When we first began to work we used smaller
capacities, and our results were more irregular, because the course of the discharge
was more erratic. The large capacity acts in the direction of making the path of the
discharge straighter, unless the sparking gap becomes too great.
