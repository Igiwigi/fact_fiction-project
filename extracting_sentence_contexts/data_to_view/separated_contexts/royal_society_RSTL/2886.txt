I was first led to the particular consideration of the subject of temperature in in-
sects by some observations on the temperature of wild bees in their natural haunts,
which were made by myself at Richborough, near Sandwich in Kent, in the autumn
of 1832, at the suggestion of Dr. Marsnas Har, for the purpose,—similar to that
of my observations on respiration, as noticed on a former occasion*,—of ascertaining
what relation, if any, subsists between the natural heat of these insects in their hyber-
nating condition and the irritability of their muscular fibre. The results of these
obseryations on the temperature of Bees are shown on Table HI., Nos. 1 to 14,
and together with many other facts connected with the physiology of insects were
communicated to Dr. Har, a short time afterwards. These observations were

+ In submitting these observations on the Temperature of Insects to the consideration of the Royal Society,
I have felt myself imperatively called upon to make the above remark, in explanation of the nature of my sup-
poxed obligations to Dr.
