Whilst then response i. is an affair of fractions of seconds, ii. is an affair of
fractions of minutes, and iii. of fractions of hours, All three effects are characterised
by positivity of the dorsal aspect of the column, and thus of the plates; and in all
three the decline occurs at first rapidly and then more slowly,

The production of these three conditions not only brings the Torpedo organ into
analogy with other electromotive tissues, muscle, nerve, &c., but throws some light
upon the phenomena displayed by the latter tissues. It is the special characteristic
of the electrical organ that any excitatory change must always, whether local or
general, produce electromotive phenomeva of the same kind ; the dorsal surface of the
columns must become positive to the ventral. In the organ of the Torpedo it is easy to recognise the fact that in the effect of
injury which corresponds to the demarcation-current we are dealing with a state
of excitation. This is not so easily recognised in such tissues as muscle and nerve,
