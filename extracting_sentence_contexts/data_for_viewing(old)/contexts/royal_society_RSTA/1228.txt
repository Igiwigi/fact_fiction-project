important because the operators forming the semigroups are rarely given in a manageable
form but in many cases something substantial can be said about the resolvents. (By contrast,
unless extra conditions are met, convergence of Laplace transforms of a sequence of vector-
valued functions does not imply point-wise convergence of these functions, see e.g. [2] p. 42,
[3] pp. 319-320, or [4] p. 13 and pp. 47-48.)

Three remarks are here in order. The first is that to prove (2.2) it suffices to show (2.3) for just
one 4 > w; this is handy, as we seem to remember curious situations where proving (2.3) for all
2. > w was next to impossible because one A > w was particularly uncooperative, despite the fact
that, as we already said, convergence of the resolvents for just one 4 > @ is known to imply this
convergence for all A > w.

The second remark is that in fact each semigroup {T,(t),t > 0} may be defined in a different
Banach space, say X;; the theorem remains in force provided that X, in a sense converge,
as r— 1, to the space X where {T(t),t > 0} is defined, with technical changes related to the
way (2.2) and (2.3) are then understood. This modification is important from the viewpoint
of stochastic processes, and has been devised so that approximation theorems may cover the
case of diffusion approximations (H.F. Trotter’s paper [5] was based on his PhD dissertation,
and his PhD advisor was William Feller). For reasons that will become clearer in the following
sections, we will, however, restrict ourselves to the case where all semigroups act in a
single space.

The third and final remark is that convergence in (2.2) is in fact, by nature, uniform for
t in bounded subintervals of Rt: you may prove it for all t>0 separately or, as is usually
easier, prove (2.3) for just one A >, and the convergence in (2.2) will turn out to be uniform
