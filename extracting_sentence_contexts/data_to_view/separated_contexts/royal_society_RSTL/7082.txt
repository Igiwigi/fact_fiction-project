This difference is still more striking on comparing the salinity of the equatorial region
with that of the northern Atlantic region (second region), whose mean is 35'932 per
1000 salt. Tt deserves further attention, that the maximum of the equatorial region is
below the mean of its neighbours both to the south and to the north. Tt appears to me
that this curious fact can be explained only by the vast quantity of fresh water which
the Niger, the Ogaway, and a number of other West African rivers carry in this region
into the sea, which all gets into the equatorial current, and moves to the westward. It
is evident that this warm water must increase its relative quantity of salt by eyaporation
during its motion across the Atlantic, and a comparison of the analyses of the single
samples of the water from the equatorial current shows that this effect really takes
place. The easternmost sample contains the minimum, with 34'238 per 1000, and the
two westernmost- samples contain the greatest quantity of salt, with 36-084.
