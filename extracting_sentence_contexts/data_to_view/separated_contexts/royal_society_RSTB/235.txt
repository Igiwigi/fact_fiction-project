It is further to be remarked
that at centres 85 and 83 the primary movements almost equalled in number the
absolute representation. (See Table I., p. 252.)

(iii.) Character of the Movements.—(a.) Absolute-—Of the 40 movements of the
thumb,

26 were flexion and
14 ,, opposition. Consequently the general movement of flexion of the digit into the palm was the only
movement obtained.
(b.) Primary.—Of 37 movements,

25 were flexion and
12 ,, opposition. These facts, coupled with those we noted in our previous paper, leave it beyond
doubt that this region, viz., the middle third of the ascending parietal convolution,
is the focus of representation of the movements of the thumb. REPRESENTATION OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE Fincers (See Plate 42, fig. 17).

(i.) Total or Absolute Representation.—The fingers are represented, in order of
diminishing intensity, at the centres :—

It is worthy of remark that at 85 the representation of the fingers was found to be
present 15 times, in contrast to 8 times at 87 and 7 times at 83. The total number of movements observed was 54.

(ii) Primary Representation.— Primary movement of the’ fingers was observed at
the following centres, in order as before :—

82, 85, 83, 81.*

On close scrutiny we found that at centre 85 the index finger was primarily

* Note complete absence of primary representation of the fingers at centre 87.
