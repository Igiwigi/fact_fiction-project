expertly guided exchange, propose to either go for it or temporize and suggest a probably more

3. Externalization of cognitive faculties

The option to let the PDT decide for you, is, in fact, the other, even more serious, challenge to
consider. Indeed, the more the PDT is developed with evermore data updating the twin’s ability
to provide counsel, the more the physical person will be tempted to trust the twin to make and
take decisions, thus displacing the centre of decision making from within to without the physical
body. This outcome of the fast-developing PDT industry is in keeping with a current phenomenon
that we call the reversal of cognitive features from inner to outer orientation. Both body and mind,
are augmented, but outside the frame of the skin. Sensory extensions, projection of the body in
robotics and virtuality in the form of avatars (with new possibilities, e.g. virtually disappearing or
flying), augmentation of the mind in symbiosis with the cognitive environment of the network, all
