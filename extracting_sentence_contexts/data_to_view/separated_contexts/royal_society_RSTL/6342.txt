Diverr, in a letter on this point, says, * In a shaft swnk
135 fathoms south of the pit” (7. e. in the direction of the dip of the beds) © T had, in
99 feet sinking, some good beds of coal. When we ceased to sink we had, I believe,
some six or seven fathoms between us and the top of the uppermost bed of lignite
in your sections.” This estimate, as to the depth at which the © 5th” bed would have
been cut, is fully borne out by the dip of the beds and the distance of the shaft, if we
aszume that no * fault” exists in the interval and the dip remains constant. On both
these points we have direct confirmatory evidence for the distance of sixty-three fathoms
south of the pit, as subterranean workings have been carried s0 far, © by driving down
the dip,” and show that the beds exist in unbroken continuity and uniform inclination;
that is, the beds have been followed to a depth of 80 feet below the bottom of the
« Coal-pit.”

Though the workmen have named the 72nd the © Iast bed,” it is no more than an
expression of the fact that it is the last or lowest they work. That there are till lower
beds is certain, since Mr. Driver says, © I sank a shaft about 13 feet” (below the bottom
of the pit) © and cut two tolerable beds of coal.” 'The workmen speak of still earlier and
deeper borings, and state that thin layers, or © shells,” of lignite were found separated
by thick beds of © muddy clay.” Omitting these traditions, however, we are now in
possession of the following figures.
