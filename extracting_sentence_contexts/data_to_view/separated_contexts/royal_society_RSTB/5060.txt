The determination of these processes
as axones or dendrites is only possible when they can be followed to their endings. The
dendrites run to other ganglia more or less adjacent to their seat of origin. There they
form a delicate varicose plexus, the fibres of which terminate in minute knob-like
swellings either on the surfaces of the bodies of other nerve cells or in an apparently diffuse
fashion in the intercellular spaces (fig. 21, Plate 31), though it may be that this latter
appearance is simply due to the fact that the related cell-bodies are unstained. The
axone, on the other hand, usually enters a fibre-bundle and may run in that for a long
distance, even passing through other ganglia. In its course it may divide, and eventually
