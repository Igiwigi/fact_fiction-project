Mr. Burrow, having ſome conne&ion with theſe
two laſt pariſhes of Lingfield and Edenbridge, im-
mediately wrote to the Rev. Mr. Goodricke of Ling-
field, to inquire into the truth of this report : and
Mr. Goodricke's anſwer confirmed the fact of its
-being felt there, and at other adjacent places ; and
added, © that it ſhook the beds and windows, and

* made the plates rattle; and went off with a noiſe,
« like a ſmall guſt of wind.” However, Mr, Burrow did not then judge it to be
either regular or proper to trouble the Society with
this account ; becauſe Mr. Goodricke only received
it from hearſay and report, he himſelf happening to
be abſent from Lingfield at that time. But Mr. Burrow having paſſed ſome days, during
the late receſs of the Society, at a place called Star-
borough-caſtle, which lies nearly b:#wwveen the two
churches of Lingfield and Edenbridge (ſcarce four
miles diſtant from each other), he has had an oppor-
tunity of being more particularly and circumſtan-
tially informed of the fact, as far as relates to thoſe
two pariſhes : and he is now aſſured, that it was cer-
tainly and undoubtedly felt and obſerved by ſome
perſons in each of thoſe two. parithes ; tho' (as it
happened in the dead of the night, when moſt peo-
ple were faſt aſleep) it was not generally perceived :
nor was it much ſpoken of, even by thoſe, who
were ſure they felt it. 'The perſons, from whoſe own mouths he can
authenticate the fact, are James Martin, Adam Kil-
lick, Mrs. Jewell, and Mr. Chapman : and he has
no leſs doubt as to.
