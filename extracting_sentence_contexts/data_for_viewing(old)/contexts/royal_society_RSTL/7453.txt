does not exist in the Crocodile as an independent bone, the postfrontal entering into
direct sutural connexion with the mastoid (temporal bar) and with the zygomatic: but
from the position and form of the Crocodile's postfrontal it 1s perfectly clear that this
bone of Lacertians is nothing but a detached portion of the postfrontal; and for such it
has been taken by CuvIER, at least in /quana (Oss. Foss. vol. v. pl. 16. fig. 23, #); in
Monitor and Varanus it is also present, although its sutural connexion with the post-
frontal has been left unnoticed by CuvieR; in Grammatophora it is absent. Profess0r
Owex does not describe it as a separate bone (Osteol. Catal. vol. i. p. 663, or Anat.
Vertebr. vol. i. p. 154), but mentions it as a continuous portion of the postfrontalF.

HorLar, who has made researches into the developments and homologies of these
bones, has come to the conclusion that the bone considered by CUuvIER to be the mastoid
in Reptiles and Vishes, is in fact the 8quamosal. A comparison of the skull of the Cro-
codile with that of Zatteria seems to support this view, inasmuch as CuyigR's © partie
6cailleuse du temporal ” of Crocodiles appears merely as a segment of the zygomaticÞ,
with which it is reunited in Hatteria.

Very remarkable is the form of the os guadratum (0) and its junction with the hind
part of the pterygoid (7); both bones are much dilated, forming a vertical plate composed
of two laminz, the lamine being immoyeably united by suture, the quadrate being the
anterior plate, the pterygoid the posterior. This sutural kind of union appears to be
unique among Lizards, which have those two bones united by a joint allowing of moye-
ability to a more or less considerable extent. The condyle of the quadrate has a deep
