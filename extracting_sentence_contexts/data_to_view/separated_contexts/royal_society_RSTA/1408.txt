This indicates that when larger
nominal areas are brought into contact and their adhesion is measured upon separation, that the
effect of surface roughness may play a more dominant role. The increased surface roughness of the stock EHA/BA/MMA films may be partially explained
by CNC aggregation, while CNCs seem to promote latex particle coalescence and increased CNC
loading may result in less homogeneous films due to aggregation induced by the incompatibility
between CNCs and polymer. In fact, using transmission electron microscopy, we have previously
demonstrated there is indeed some CNC aggregation at higher loadings (particularly at 1 wt%
CNCs [6]), and CNC aggregates may further change the coalescence and morphology /uniformity
of the polymer film. We note that previous imaging of these films showed areas completely void
of CNCs while other areas were clearly enriched with loose CNC aggregates [6]. We believe that
this heterogeneity in CNC distribution is directly linked to the variability in the PSA tack and
peel strength measurements.
