Now, as the rapidity of volatilization is known to
Rbe increased by a reduction of pressure, it follows that a larger amount of the combustible
would be thus removed from the upper portion of the wick in rarefied than in com-
pressed air. Nevertheless this influence of reduced pressure must be yery small in the
case of bodies poxsessing 8uch high boiling-points as tallow, wax, &c., and hence its
influence upon the rate of combustion in rarefied air cannot be perceived. Oppoxed to the above facts and considerations stands the observation of M. TrGes,
that candles burn much more rapidly in air compressed three times than in air at the
ordinary pressure. This discrepancy, the cause of which can now only be conjectured,
may perhaps. reside in some_ of the cireumstances, described above, under which the
experiments were made. 'The constant supply of compressed air to a chamber such as that
