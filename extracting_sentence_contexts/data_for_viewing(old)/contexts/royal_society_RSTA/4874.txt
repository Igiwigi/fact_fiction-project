of 20Wm~?°C"!, with a fixed atmospheric temperature of —20°C. The vertical velocity was
calculated using equation (6.3) with a = 0.003 and R, =5. We see that, in this monotonic-growth
scenario, the temperature field remains approximately linear, the salinity decreases over the 100
days simulated to a modal value of approximately 6 ppt, while the brine volume also decreases to
a modal value of less than approximately 0.1. In consequence of the ever-changing porosity, the
maximum Rayleigh number is maintained at a roughly constant size. Many other scenarios have
been explored, particularly by Griewank & Notz [20].

The brine flux predicted by this model is shown as a function of time in figure 1. In comparison,
the dashed curve shows the prediction of a zero-layer Semtner model with the same boundary
conditions, with brine fluxes determined by assuming a fixed ice salinity of 4ppt. The very
close agreement between these two models at late times is coincidental and unexpected given
the approximate nature of the examples chosen here for illustration and the fact that the two
calculations give rather different predictions (not shown) of the thickness of sea ice as a function
of time. However, the correspondence of the functional forms predicted is relevant and indicates
that the convective model can be tuned to give similar long-term trends as a fixed-salinity model
for a given scenario.

7. Discussion and conclusion

Brine drainage from sea ice is a complex process involving interactions between fluid flow in a
porous medium and phase change that affects the fluid-mechanical properties of the medium.
All of that happens on horizontal scales of millimetres to centimetres, and the internal flows
are intrinsically three-dimensional on those scales. An understanding of the underlying physics
has led to the recent emergence of one-dimensional models that seem capable of predicting
