where the superior parietal lobule is complexly folded I have found that the operculum
anterior fossee parieto-occipitalis may be continued right on to the dorsal surface to
include the sulcus intraparietalis; so that an extensive operculation may extend
from the sulcus calcarinus on the medial surface to the sulcus intraparietalis on the
lateral surface. In this hemisphere there does not appear to be an operculation of
this nature. The apparent branch of a fissura parieto-occipitalis is in reality the inner
end of the branch of the sulcus intraparietalis which bounds the arcus parieto-occipitalis
anteriorly. It is probable that it is only superficially confluent with the sulcus limitans
precunei. The grounds for this view are (a) the lack of development of the upper
part of the preecuneus, (b) the simplicity of pattern of the sulci of the precuneus, (c) the
identification of the sulci in the cuneus as the incisura parieto-occipitalis, the sulcus
paracalcarinus and the sulcus limitans ares striate, superioris. The small posterior
arm of what appears to be the fissura parieto-occipitalis is, if the above facts are valid,
the upper end of the suleus limitans precunei. A series of Australian brains shows
some which are very similar to this in which the operculum anterior fosse parieto-
occipitalis is only developed in its lower half. In higher forms the increased operculation
leads to the covering of the incisura parieto-occipitalis and the sulcus paracalcarinus
(21p) together with the arcus intercuneatus. When this occurs we get a simple linear
fissura parieto-occipitalis. In the Bushwoman, the sulcus in the cuneus lying more
or less parallel with the sulcus limitans-praecunei, is the sulcus paracalcarinus (21p),
having a distinctly simian form. Between the sulcus limitans precunei and the sulcus
paracalcarinus the incisura parieto-occipitalis (217) is seen cutting the dorso-medial
