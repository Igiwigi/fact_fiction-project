J. THomson (‘Recent Researches in
Electricity and Magnetism,’ p. 158). The following explanation may be offered of
the fact that this is a minimum striking potential, and that it is approximately
constant. The negative glow in any gas [as has been shown by Warpure (‘ Wied. Ann.,’ 31,
p. 579)] requires for its production a definite potential difference (about 340 volts in
the case of air), independent of the pressure, and constant, so long as the glow is not
crushed into a smaller space than that which it would naturally occupy.
