The formuls and curves for the reconstruction of stature which are given in this
memoir, must by no means be taken as final. No scientific investigation can be
final ; it merely represents the most probable conclusions which can be drawn from
the data at the disposal of the writer. A wider range of facts, or more refined
analysis, experiment, and observation will always lead to new formule and new
theories. This is the essence of scientific progress. All, therefore, which is claimed
for this paper is (i.) that it exhibits a better theory of the reconstruction of stature
than any which has so far existed—it might not be too much to say that nothing
which can be called a theory has hitherto existed; (ii.) that it determines the
constants of the formule given by that theory as well as the existing data allow of ;
(iii.) that it gives values for the probable statures of prehistoric races, which have
far less divergence among themselves, whatever be the bone or combination of bones

used, than those suggested by previous investigators; and lastly (iv.) that it
indicates what additional data ought to be sought for, and to some extent what is
the inner meaning of divergent results, for the great problem of racial differentiation
by natural selection.*

Of the general conclusions reached by the author, perhaps two deserve restating
and emphasising here.
