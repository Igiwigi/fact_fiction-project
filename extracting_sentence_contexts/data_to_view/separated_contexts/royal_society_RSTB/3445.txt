the knot of Specimen DD, by the small und not very prominent mass of cells forming
the posterior lip of the blastopore in figs. 9 and 10, Plate 4. The blastopore itself
would then be represented, in the knot of Specimen Y, by the line of continuity
between the vesicular ectoderm and the knot-tissue around the central cell-plug. And the latter is, in fact, surrounded and limited by a sulcus, the peripheral
boundary of which would represent the blastoporic rim. In text-fig. 6, we present
a schematic surface-projection of the central plug in relation to the rest of the
knot, showing its overlapping anteriorly. TEXxt-FIG. 6.—Schematic Surface-projection of the “ Cell-plug” (‘c.p.” in text-figs. 4 and 5) in Primitive
Knot of Specimen Y.
