For each of the five ship types, the calculated values for the possible savings in kg per nautical
mile, as well as the calculated possible cost, emission (CO and other greenhouse gases like CO2Â¢)
and pollution savings are shown. In each case, we calculated the values for the three friction
reduction scenarios. In order to put all these figures in a more comprehensive context, we calculated the values for
a fictional journey for each of the ship types.

(a) Bulk carrier /kuna

The bulk carrier Ikuna (figure 4a) was built in 1986 and has a dead weight tonnage of 6666 tons. It is a ship of the Indian company Mercator Limited. It is powered by two medium-speed 4-
stroke engines and the initial fuel consumption (shortly after cleaning) at a reference speed of 11
knots is around 47 kg per nautical mile [48].
