DIFFRACTION OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL SOUND PULSES 19

When ¢— X is not small, 8X(¢—X) is large and we can drop the tan“! symbol in the first
term to obtain the result (88) corresponding to the behaviour of the slit as a simple source.
It will be noted that as ¢—X increases, the first term in (93) decreases whilst the second
increases, and the pressure has in fact a minimum, within the range of validity of (93), given

The pressure /, on the back of either half-plane has been evaluated at points distant
Y = 0(0-2)4 from the edge for times ¢ = 0(0-2)4. The relevant values of Gp are given in
tables 1a and 16 which were calculated from equation (40) to an accuracy of three units
or better in the fourth decimal place. The function /, was evaluated from equation (42) for
