sary as soon as we take a view unrestricted by the method of moments ; of the so-called
heterotypic curves between + = 3 and r= 7 it should be noticed that they not
only fall into the ordinary Pearsonian types, but have finite values for the moment
coeflicients 8, and 8,; they differ from those in which 7 exceeds 7, merely in the fact
that the value of 8,, calculated from the fourth moment of a sample, has an infinite probable
error. It is therefore evident that this is not the right method to treat the sample, but
this does not constitute, as it has been called, “ the failure of Type IV.,” but merely
the failure of the method of moments to make a valid estimate of the form of these
curves. As we shall see in more detail, the method of moments, when its efficiency is
tested, fails equally in other parts of the diagram.

In expression (3) we have found that the efficiency of the method of moments for
location of a curve of Type IV. is
