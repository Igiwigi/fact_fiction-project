played a key role in promoting the periodic table to the scientific community. Scerri [1] argued : =

Darwin’s contribution is overwhelmingly shaped by the scope of his ability to accommodate
diverse facts and disciplines. His synthesis spanned anatomy, embryology and systematics, which
comprised the bulk of the life sciences of his day, and united them under a single conceptual
framework. It then went further by incorporating biogeography, behaviour and palaeontology.
Darwin made predictions, but the role of prediction in the success of his theory was small by
comparison.

7. Fact versus theory

The different public receptions of the periodic table and Darwin’s theory can be attributed to one
running afoul of religious beliefs while the other does not, but there are other reasons as well. The
foundation of the periodic table is the elements and their properties. All elements are retrievable
and the assessments of their properties can be replicated.
