As each
disturbing cause—first the mountains, secondly the possible variation in density below,
thirdly the ocean—was thought of and the effect calculated, the resulting curvature, of
course, came out differently. ”

In the present communication, however, I shall demonstrate that no change in the
curvature of the arc, within reasonable and indeed wide limits, can possibly have any
appreciable effect on the calculated amplitude. It is this fact which leads to the result
T have announced in the first paragraph. I will explain how this result did not flow
from my former calculations. The length of the arc s between two tations is

a(1—4zs)).—$az 8in A cos 2M,

z and m being the amplitude and middle latitude, and «., s the semi-major-axis and
ellipticity.
