only a small smearing (Navier-Stokes—Fourier) of the order of a mean free path. However,
when the gradients increase, also the dispersion effects come into play which is precisely
what the surface energy is responsible for in Korteweg’s picture. It is clear that the non-
locality associated with this effect is essential since no truncation of the Chapman-Enskog
series is possible.


Of course, one could argue that continuum mechanics plays no role in predicting the motion of the Lo |
radiometer and that one must rely exclusive on kinetic theory. This is the one of the conclusions

made in the survey paper [48]. Their point is a fair one. However, this view would fail to consider “a

6. Obstruction to the passage from Korteweg to Euler

Let us recall the balance laws of mass, momentum and energy for a compressible fluid given by
system (2.1) The usual prescription for achieving a limit from a fine-scale theory to a macroscopic :
theory is via the concept of a weak solution to the relevant system of partial differential equations [=
so that the limit system is satisfied in the sense of distributions. In particular to obtain a weak 3
solution to the Euler equations as a limit from Korteweg theory would require the extra Korteweg :8
