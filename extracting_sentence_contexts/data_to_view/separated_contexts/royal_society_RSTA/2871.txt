The calculation of Au(u? + v* +1?)
was also complicated by the fact that the gas was not assumed to be at rest; but on revision, despite these
simplifications, I decided to omit the routine calculations altogether. Equation (26) was not given in the paper as originally written because it is connected with the
conductivity of mixed gases, and I was then unaware of any experiments on the subject which would
make so tedious a calculation worth the while. I have since found such experimental data, and have
therefore worked out the formula (26), the results of which (as will be seen in Part III.)
