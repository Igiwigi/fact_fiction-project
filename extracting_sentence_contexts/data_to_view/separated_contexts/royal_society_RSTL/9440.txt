Now making the functions on the left equal in sets, and dividing by any requisite
Py integer, we have a result which may be written

IhiÞ() +haf(9)+ +» +hnGu(Yn)=W

where the þ's are similar functions, m is any number whatever, W is an algebraical
and logarithmic function of the y's, which are themselves connected by 0 relations, and
the //s are any numbers whatever. If we express 0 of these variables as functions of the rest and call them 2's, putting
n for m—0O, we can write

hom) +hþ(1)+ - - - +hh lg =wth$ (4) + : tho o(2):

Or making, as we may, the ks each=unity we have shown how to find the
expression required,*

* The 8ubscript letters attached here, and not before, to the functional symbols introduce no novelty. They are only intended to suggest the fact that what we have written y-(z1), y-(#g) . - - are really y-(z1, 91),
V(g, vg), - - +; While yy and yy . . . are not necessarily the 8ame functions of a1, ay . . This has not
been hitherto overlooked, it is only more clearly put in evidence now.
