These mean data all correspond to the limit T â€” oo in our analysis. We see in figure 1a that the
1/7 power law is a good fit to the mean streamwise velocity profile over most of the channel
width, except in the viscous sublayer where u, ~ y+. Best fits reveal, in fact, that the power
m is slowly decreasing with Re. Figure 1b shows that the drag law is Blasius-like, but with an
exponent somewhat smaller than 1/4. The plots in figure 1c,d show that our hypotheses (4.6) and
(4.7) are reasonable if one takes h = 12v/u,, with both mean streamwise velocity and Reynolds
stress exhibiting near power laws.
