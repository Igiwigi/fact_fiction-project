crossing the fibres of the superficial or first external layer at an acute angle, the fibres of
the second and sixth layers at a slightly obtuse angle, and the fibres of the third
(Plate XIV. fig. 31) and fifth (Plate XIV. fig. 32) layers at a very obtuse angle. When,
however, the spirals formed by the fibres of the internal layers of the right ventricle
(Plate XIV. figs. 36 & 37) are examined or compared with the spirals formed by the
fibres of the internal layers of the left ventricle (Plate XII. figs. 6 & T), the segmentary
nature of the former is at once apparent, these in no instance forming complete double
conical spirals similar to those found in the left ventricle, but only spiral fragments, or
at most flattened rings, 8uch as would be obtained by isolating or detaching a portion
of a perfect cone composed of the double conical spirals described.

Pifth layer of the right ventricle (Mammal). The fifth layer of the right ventricle
(Plate XIV. fig. 32), from the fact of its being immediately to the inner side of the
fourth central or transverse layer (Plate XIII. figs. 23 & 28, p g), is the first of the in-
ternal ones (Plate XIV. fig. 32, pp, 49). The fibres composing it proceed in a very

oblique spiral direction from behind forwards and from right to left upwards; and
are aggregated into well-marked fascicular bundles which are continuous anteriorly
(Plate XIV. fig. 36, 0) and for the most part posteriorly with fibres having a like direc-
tion on the right third of the septum (p'q'). They are continuous also with the fibres
of the third external layer at the base. As the common fibres do not extend to, or im-
plicate the internal layers, the fibres of the right third of the septum readily become
