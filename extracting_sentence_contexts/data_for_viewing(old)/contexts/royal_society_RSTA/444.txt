wealth.

Let f(v, t) be the density of agents which at time f > 0 are represented by their wealth v € R,.
As explained in §2, the time evolution of the distribution of wealth, say f(v,t), consequent to
binary interactions of type (3.1) among agents of the system, is obtained by resorting to kinetic
collision-like models [4,34]. The time evolution of the distribution of wealth obeys here a bilinear
Boltzmann-like equation, which in weak form reads

In (3.2), the post-interaction wealths v* and w* are given by (3.1). Also in this case, (-) represents
mathematical expectation, and the expectation takes into account the fact that the interaction
coefficients p; and qj are non-negative random variables.


In [4], the trade has been modelled to include the idea that wealth changes hands for a specific 6 |
reason: one agent intends to invest his wealth in some asset, property, etc., in the possession of his

trade partner. Typically, such investments bear some risk, and either provide the buyer with some a
additional wealth, or lead to the loss of wealth in a non-deterministic way. An easy realization 1B
of this idea [14] consists in coupling saving propensity with some risky investment that yields an <
immediate gain or loss proportional to the current wealth of the investing agent, : 3
