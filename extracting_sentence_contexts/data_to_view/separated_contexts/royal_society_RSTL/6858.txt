Adding
two atoms of hydrogen and one of carbon to the formic ether, we obtain acetic ether,
and by this addition the balance is turned; for though acetic ether falls short of 8ul-
phuric ether in multitude, it transcends it in absorbent and radiant power. Outstand-
ing from all others, when equal yolumes are compared, and signalizing itself by the
enormous magnitude of its absorption, we have boracic ether, each molecule of which
embraces no less than 25 atoms. The time now at my disposal enables me to do little
more than glance at these singular facts ; but I must direct the attention of chemists to
the water molecule: its power as a radiant and an absorbent is perfectly unprecedented
and anomalous, if the usually recognized formula be correct. 342 PROFESSOR TYNDALL'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO MOLECULAR PHYSICS. $6.
