WHALES OF THE GENERA MEGAPTERA AND BALASNOPTERA. 233

axial rotation is mainly concentrated in the atlanto-epistropheal joint. In the
Mystacocetes, however, the shortening up of the cervical vertebrae, and in some forms
their fusion, effectually prevents both side-to-side movement and rotary movement,
except in front of the atlas vertebra.

In those Whales in which the cervical vertebrae remain separate, it is evident,
from the accessory articulation that exists between the atlas and the axis vertebra
above the spinal cord, that any rotary movement about the odontoid, or about the
epistropheal centrum that sometimes takes the place of the odontoid (see Smers, 29,
p. 189), is of the slightest extent (Dwicur, 8, Plate 6, fig. 5, c). Owing to the
fact, however, that the two occipital condyles, taken together, present the form of
a hemisphere, fitting into a basin-shaped atlas vertebra*, the looseness of the marginal
part of the synovial capsule permits of slight movements in all directions, up-and-
down, side-to-side, and rotary.

That the coalescence of the two condyles in Whales is secondary is the view already
taken by Gaurr (1908,} p. 522) and pe Buruer (6, III, pp. 124-5, and V, p. 3) upon
embryological grounds, and it is supported by paleontological considerations. In
Prosquaiodon, for instance, as has been shown by ABEL (1912,} Plate 3), the condyles
are like those of an ordinary Mammal, and are too wide apart to permit of any but a
hinge-movement in an up-and-down direction. The syncondyly of modern Whales is
thus to be regarded as a purely secondary feature, associated with the transfer of the
rotary joint from the atlanto-epistropheal to the atlanto-occipital position.
