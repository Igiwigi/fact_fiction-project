The very remarkable pelvic fin of Macropetalichthys is of course
comparable with a primitive Elasmobranch like Cladoselache, but it is equally similar
to the primitive pelvic fins found in Sturgeons and in Saurichthys and Palaconiscids. There remain only two of STENsIoâ€™s comparisons.

(10) The non-articulation of the palato-quadrate with the ethmoidal region. Even
if true this fact would provide no evidence of Elasmobranch affinities; the palato-
quadrates of Acanthodians always end in a free anterior border which lies behind the
ethmoidal region.

(1) The general shape of the neuro-cranium with its widened ventral surface was
by far the most Elasmobranch-like of all the structures of the fish. This resemblance
becomes much less striking when critically considered. The very long occipital region
is unparalleled in Elasmobranchs, where indeed it is always exceptionally short.
