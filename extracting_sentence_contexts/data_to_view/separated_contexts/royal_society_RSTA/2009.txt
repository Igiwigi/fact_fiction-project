This separation in Kr, X and RaEm has been explicable as due to
a displacement close to 5A, on the mantissa of a d(1) sequent. In the present case
the example taken is not the most important F series, but its limit will be near that
to which the separation is due. The displacement required in it to produce a
separation 150 is very close to 5A,, in fact 5A, produces 149. The separation in
question then is caused by displacement of the normal A,-multiple for this series. The second reason is based on the form of the oceurrency curve, which shows the
same sharply defined single peaked curve as in X. It is represented in Plate 2,

It may be interesting to note that all Srark’s A*** lines, 7.e., whose sources have
lost three electrons, all show ¢ links except one.
