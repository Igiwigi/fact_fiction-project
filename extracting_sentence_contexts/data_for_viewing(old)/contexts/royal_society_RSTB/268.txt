Yune state that certain “paquets de granules réunis ont, suivant M. Perrier, des
queues trés longues et déliées ; ce sont done de véritables zoospores” (22, p. 570). That
certain “ paquets de granules” do exist buried in the tissues of the adult I willingly
admit, but they have no sort of resemblance to the true sacculi, and the account given
above of the development of the latter is entirely opposed to the supposition that
they are formed by collections of these granules. Moreover, the fine processes of the
spherule-bearing sacs were described by Perrter as joining the wall of the sacculus ;
they exhibit no amoeboid movement, and are not in the least suggestive of flagella.

But the strongest argument of all against this part of Vor and Yune’s theory is
the fact that during life the contents of the sacculi are absolutely colourless, which is
entirely inconsistent with the statement that they are algoid zoospores. Yet this
fact should have been well known, since it has been frequently mentioned (21, p. 527.;
6, p. 127 ; 18, p. 67).

(3.) It is impossible absolutely to prove that the yellow-cells and sacculi have no
connection with one another ; but their extremely different appearance in the living
animal and the entire absence, so far at least as my observations go, of any inter-
mediate structures between them render such a connection so highly improbable,
that the onus of proof must rest with Messrs. Voet and Yuna.

The Skeleton.—As already mentioned, the number of stem-joints in the free-swim-
ming larva is variable, but by the time the larva fixes itself from thirteen to fifteen

Very shortly after fixation all the stem-joints in succession, beginning with the most
