This is evident also
from experimental data of several publications. Finally, in the authors’ opinion, the determination of the compressive strength of composites in
the presence of voids should consider not just the void content but more importantly the critical
number of affected fibres using a probabilistic approach. Owing to the fact that the formation
of voids cannot be avoided during the manufacturing process of composites, the presented
approach has to be extended to further load cases, e.g. transverse tensile, shear loading. This
would create the possibility to integrate a parameter of failure criteria to estimate the upper and
lower bounds for critical loads in the phase of design. The precondition, therefore, is whether a
critical size/position or certain amount of voids exists and how voids influence the mechanical
behaviour under various load cases. : =
