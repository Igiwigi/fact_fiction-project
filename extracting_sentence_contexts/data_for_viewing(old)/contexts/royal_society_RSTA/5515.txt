with the blurring of the boundaries between internal logistics systems and manufacturing
automation systems in flexible and novel configurations working alongside human operators.

From relatively simple pick-and-place operations, there is a progression now to more
intelligent capabilities. For example, to handle a range of tasks where different tools are required,
aided by the evolution of modularity in the robotic systems and the configuration of different
transport systems to allow such autonomous systems to be used for a wide variety of tasks, in a
variety of environments.


(b) Dynamically integrating manufacturing automation with internal logistics

The DIALOG research project at WMG addresses the fact that much of manufacturing and indeed
industry more widely operates in a far from optimal manner in the face of volatile customer
preferences and often unforeseen disturbances.

The vision is for practical, dynamically adaptable automation systems that are readily scalable.
Further to this, the concept is to enable a new form of low-cost manually operated intra-logistics
systems that can be readily and progressively automated through the addition of autonomous
mobile robots (AMRs).

The application focuses on integrating this system of systems within a generic infrastructure
and related configuration tools, with use cases in the automotive seat assembly, riveted body
assembly fastening, battery module and pack production, horticulture, and food and drink
sectors. These will be oriented around the application of a generic approach based on the use of
