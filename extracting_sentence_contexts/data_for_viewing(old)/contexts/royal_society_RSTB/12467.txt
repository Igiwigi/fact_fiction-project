While the role of hippocampal ripples in memory conso-
lidation has been linked to replay of behaviourally relevant
sequences from previous experience, it is not clear whether
such sequences also exist during extra-hippocampal ripples.
Studies from various cortical areas, even those not receiving
direct CA1 output, show coordinated hippocampal-cortical
replay [136-141]. Yet, no study to date has reported the
involvement of cortical fast oscillation in cortical replay,
and, although cortical replay is associated with spindles
and delta waves [142], the overall relationship between the
coupling of hippocampal-cortical ripples and coordinated
replay is unclear. The fact that different subsets of ripples
(as clustered by LFP profile) are associated with distinct
activity patterns across most of the brain [9] presents a chal-
lenge for determining the contribution of specific
hippocampal replay events in driving divergent responses
in efferent regions.

5. Conclusion

More than four decades have passed since ripple oscil-
lations were first described in the rodent hippocampus
[143], yet the function and mechanism of this phenomenon
are far from fully understood. Throughout this review, we
