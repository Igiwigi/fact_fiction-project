all cases, in the central 5 Â¢ of each double track as observed in the plates.

The mean range of fission tracks in B 1 and C2 emulsions, desensitized by 0-5 % uranyl
acetate solutions, is 24-0 4. The mean total range of fission fragments in air is 44 mm., hence
the stopping power of these emulsions for heavy ions is 1840 approximately. In strongly
desensitized plates, the mean range is reduced, and it is 23-0 in an emulsion desensitized
with a 4% uranyl acetate solution. This effect may be explained on the basis of the range-
velocity relation for heavy ions derived by Bohr (1941) ; this shows that the specific ionization
decreases with decreasing velocity over the greater part of the trajectory before rising to
a sharp maximum at very low velocities. This maximum, however, is concentrated within
a very short distance, of the order of the mean diameter of the grains in a photographic plate,
and its effect is therefore not normally evident in the Ilford plates. The general decrease of
specific ionization with decreasing velocity does, on the other hand, account for the fact
that, in strongly desensitized plates, the latter parts of the fragment tracks are not recorded,
since the density of ionization is insufficient to render the grains developable. The observed
mean range under these conditions is, therefore, less than the true mean range of the fragments.

3. THE ANALYSIS OF RECOIL TRACKS PRODUCED BY NUCLEAR COLLISIONS

The occurrence of a large number of nuclear recoil tracks along the path of a fission
fragment is a consequence of the high charge and high mass (vide Bohr 1940) of the fragment.
Such recoil tracks occurring in the central parts of double-fission tracks may be confused
with the tracks of particles emitted at the instant of fission, and it is therefore necessary to
make an analysis of the recoil tracks in order that they may be distinguished, on the basis
either of their total abundance or of the deflexion of the fission fragment track.
