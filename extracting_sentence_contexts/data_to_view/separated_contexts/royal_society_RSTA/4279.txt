III. P between Q, and R,. In the inner spherical nucleus the vortex lines lie on
the same side of the stream lines as the meridians—they are, in fact, exactly similar
to the second category. At the boundary between the central nucleus and the outer
layer ¢ = 0, the stream lines coincide with the meridians, In the outer layer the
stream lines lie on the other side of the meridian, with the vortex lines beyond. When
P coincides with R, or \ is the second \, parameter the stream lines coincide with the
vortex lines again, but on the opposite side of the meridians.
