It
is with difficulty the letters can be made out when the paper is taken from the yo-
lame, but by immersing it in a solution of iodine they become a deep blue, verging
on a black, whilst the ground remains of a yellow colour, which by the continued
action of the fluid changes to a light violet. On drying, the ground becomes con-
siderably darker, and the printing, though evident, indistinet, appearing in s0me posi-
tions the lightest, in others the darkest portions of the paper. These, and the facts
above-mentioned, render it probable that we may eventually succeed in copying
prints, &c. by mere juxtaposition. R. H.
