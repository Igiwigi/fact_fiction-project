results. In fact the corresponding ROC curve, plotted in dashed black in figure 62, would be
below the random guess curve without the reversion. If we apply the PostP method to the
reversed COS classification, we can improve the classification performance. This is verified by
the increase in the area under the ROC curve (plotted in solid black in figure 6a). However,
even with post-processing, the COS classification of the raw hyperspectral image still needs to
be reversed. To solve this issue, we devised and applied the pre-processing method PreP based
on the MIF algorithm and described in the previous section. The COS classification of the pre-
processed hypercube is shown in figure 5b. Its ROC curve, plotted in dashed blue in figure 6a,
is now directly above the random guess curve without any need to reverse the classification.
Nevertheless, its performances are worse than those produced by the reversed COS classification
of the raw dataset—the dashed black curve is clearly above the solid blue one. However, if
we apply the PostP method to the COS classification of the pre-processed hypercube, we get a
better performance than any other COS classification with or without post-processing. In fact, the
solid blue ROC curve is above all the others in figure 6a. We can also try to apply the wavelet
transform as a denoising post-processing method. If we plot the corresponding ROC curve,
its performances are slightly worse than those obtained using the proposed method—the solid
