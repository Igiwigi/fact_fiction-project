It has hitherto been spared, because, like
other evils of greater magnitude, its ill effects have not been very startling and sudden, and
it was hard to believe that so harmless-looking and quiet a thing could do much mischief. The unseen and little-noticed causes of death and disease, however, are by far the most
fatal. The small germ of typhoid or drain fever slays its thousands every year; but this
fact attracts less general attention than the drowning of five hundred by a collision or by a
flood. Yet of these the first is the most easily preventable evil. So we have been content to
pour the refuse from our domestic fires into the open air, and leave the work of scavenging
to unaided natural forces; to disregard ‘matter in the wrong place,’ so long as it has not
killed its hundreds or thousands at a time, and have tolerated something like suffocation,
so long as it performed its work slowly, made no unseemly disturbance, and took care
not to demand its hecatombs very suddenly and dramatically.
