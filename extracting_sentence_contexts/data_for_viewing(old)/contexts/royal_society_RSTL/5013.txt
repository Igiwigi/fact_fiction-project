the peritoneum, and is filled by a fluid which is wngquestionably an organic fluid, In
the Annelida the peritoneal membrane is not vibratile, the oscillations of the fluid
contents cannot therefore be due to ciliary vibration. This fact distinguishes the
Annelids from the Echinoderms, Medus# and Zoophytes : it further proves that the
movements of the chylaqueous fluid are not in ALL cases dependent on the presence
of cilia. The rule is snspended in this class. In Glycera alba, and in one or two
other species, however, the peritoneum where it penetrates the appendage is lined by
vibratile cilia. Anteriorly to the researches herein recorded, I am not aware that any
anatomist has recognised the real physiological meaning, or described the true
histological characters of the chylaqueous fluid in the Annelida. In the historical
introduction to this paper I have already indicated the extent to which the researches
of M. QuaTreraces have proceeded in that direction. To him undeniably belongs
the credit of having independently determined the fact of the existence of *a fluid‚Äù in
the visceral cavity of the Annelid. The first publication of his generalized results
occurs in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles for 1852. The results of wy dissections,
announcing the existence of a chylaqueous system of fAluid in the Annelida, were
first made public at the Meeting of the Bvitish Association, which was held at Swan-
Sea in the year 1849. It was not until this year (1852) that I became acquainted

ence to, the fluids. 'The light already reflected on the question of their organization, which has 80 bog re-
mained unanswerable, has rendered the habitats, unusual though they be, affected by these eccentric beings, n0

longer an arcanum, a theme of superstitious wonder, in physiological science.
