Rabbit all the ova of one impregnation are discharged at ahout the same time. This
is opposed to the opinion of Prgvosr and DuwmasF, that in the Rabbit at least two
days elapse before all the ova destined to be developed have left the ovary. That I
am correct in this particular, is rendered still more probable by the fact, that in the
Fallopian tube, and in the beginning of the uterus, minute ova are generally (though
not in every instance) met with lying very near together}. Having found more than
three hundred ova in the uterus and tube, I may perhaps venture to speak with some
confidence as to their particular localities, which it has uniformly been my practice
to record. A general idea of the situation in which many of the minuter ova have
been observed, may be obtained from the Tables (par. 319.),

131. If my endeayours to obtain ova when just on the point of entering the tube
were for a long while fruitless, unexpected facts were noticed, amply repaying all the
lahour. It was in the course of those wearisome endeavours, that the germinal ve-
sicle first presented itself in situations which made me doubt its disappearing at the
period hitherto snpposed. I saw it in mature ova half-way between the surface and
the centre of the yelk,â€”a locality which was remarkable from the fact, that ante
coitum, and even while the ovum is yet immature, the germinal vesicle is seen to
have passed to the surface of the yelk. Now such a situation of the germinal yesicle
would probably have escaped wy attention, if the observation had not been many
times repeated. Yet on a knowledge of the fact that the germinal vesicle returns to
the centre of the yelk, depends the possibility of fully understanding the oyum in
some of its future phases.

132. I shall now describe the changes apparently resulting from sexual connexion,
