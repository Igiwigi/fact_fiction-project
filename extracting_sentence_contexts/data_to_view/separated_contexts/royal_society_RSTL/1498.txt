MY DEAR SIR,

Ir can scarcely have escaped the notice of the most inatten-
tive observer of vegetation, that in whatever position a secd is
placed to germinate, its radicle invariably makes an effort to
descend towards the centre of the earth, whilst the elongated
germen takes a precisely opposite direction ; and it has been
proved by Du Hamer * that if a seed, during its germination,
be frequently inverted, the points both of the radicle and
germen will return to the first direction. Some naturalists
have supposed these opposite effects to be produced by gra-
vitation ; and it is not difficult to conceive that the same agent,
by operating on bodies so differently organized as the radicle
and germen of plants are, may occasion the one to descend
and the other to ascend. The hypothesis of these naturalists doesnot, however, appear
to have been much strengthed by any facts they were able
to adduce in support of it, nor much weakened by the argu-
ments of their opponents ; and therefore, as the phenomena

observable during the conversion of a seed into a plant are
amongst the most interesting that occur in vegetation, I
commenced the experiments, an account of which I have now
the honour to request you to lay before the Royal Society. I conceived that if gravitation were the cause of the descent
of the radicle, and of the ascent of the germen, it must act
either by its immediate influence on the vegetable fibres and
vessels during their formation, or on the motion and consc-
quent distribution of the true sap afforded by the cotyledons :
and as gravitation could prodtice these effects only whilst the
seed remained at rest, and in the same position relative to
the attraction of the earth, I imagined that its operation would
become suspended by constant and rapid change of the posi-
tion of the germinating seed, and that it might be counter-
acted by the agency of centrifugal force. Having a strong ill of water passing through my garden,
I constructed a small wheel similar to those used for grinding
corn, adapting another wheel of a different construction, and
formed of very slender pieces of wood, to the same axis.
