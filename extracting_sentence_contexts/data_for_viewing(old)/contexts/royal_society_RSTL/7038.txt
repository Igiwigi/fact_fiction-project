lower gravels have a more washed, sorted, and worn character than the upper gravels,
although there is in these also a certain proportion of angular materials.

As the various Eocene, Miocene, or Pliocene strata spread over the South of England
and North of France prove that, at s0me comparatively late geological period, the sea or
large lakes extended over that area, it follows as an almost necessary consequence, that,
when the land rose from beneath those seas or those lakes, a mass of debris, in quantity
and length of transport proportionate to the greater or less rate of elevation and the
depth of the snperincumbent waters, must have been spread oyer the bottom of the
channels along which the water flowed off; and assuming the rise to have been tolerably
uniform over considerable districts, the course of the currents would be influenced by the
form the land assumed during its emergence, or in fact by the present watersheds, which
either result from or else bore part in that operation. In either case the ultimate effect,
80 far as our position is concerned, would be the same. That this must have been a
vera causa to a certain extent is manifest, inasmuch as that which was sea or lake is
now dry land; and although it will not explain the origin of all the high-level gravels,
there is a certain proportion of these beds which may nevertheless have this older and
independent origin®*: it is to be distinguished by rising higher up the hills, and not
being restricted to s0 definite a level as some of the other beds. I have reason to believe
that some of the gravels in the South of England and the higher levels of the Somme
valley may be of this age,—such as those above Epagnette, and the higher leyels of
those above Breilly and Montiers. In proof of the existence of some gravels older than
those of St. Acheul and yet belonging to the Somme valley, I would mention the not
uncommon occurrence at that place of subangular flints, with a deep brown staining,
