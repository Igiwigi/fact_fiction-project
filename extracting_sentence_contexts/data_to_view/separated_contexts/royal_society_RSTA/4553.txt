If this were the
case, then we would expect to see a considerable reduction in the inter-model spread in the
ConvOff experiments. The standard models have a range of 1.07 (—0.34 to 0.73) W m*K~!. This
range is not reduced however in the ConvOff experiments; in fact it increases by 23% to 1.32
(—0.52 to 0.80) Wm~* K~1. Similarly, the standard deviation increases by 25%. At face value, this
would seem to indicate that differences in the details of convective parametrizations are not the
dominant cause of inter-model spread in global mean cloud feedbacks in this particular selection
of climate models.
