The rivers carry the mud with their
waters into the ſea, at the bottom of which that mud
depoſits itſelf. From the riſing of the bottom of the ſea, that of
the level of the water naturally follows. Dr. Do-
nati furniſhes us with a great number of facts in
proof of this. He obſerved, that at Venice, in Iftria,
and in Dalmatia, the level of the waters is ſeveral
feet higher than it was formerly. This elevation of
the waters is obſerved only on the northern and
eaſtern coaſts of the Adriatic.
