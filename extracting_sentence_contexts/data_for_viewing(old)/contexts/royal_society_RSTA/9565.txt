(iii.) On the Measurement of Wind-velocity.

The simplest laboratory method of obtaining a stream-line wind-velocity, whose
value is known directly without reference to the calibration of Pitot-tubes or anemo-
meters, is realized by the use of a whirling table to which is attached a light arm at
the extremity of which the object to be experimented upon is attached. The advan-
tage of this method is, however, more apparent than real. It is well-known that in
such a disposition of apparatus a vortex is created in the neighbourhood of the
rotating arm, so that the velocity of a point at any radius relative to the room does not
represent its velocity relative to the air. In addition to the difficulty mentioned
results obtained from air-velocities measured from motion in a circle cannot in some
classes of work be applied with safety to linear motion. In fact so serious have these
objections proved themselves to be that the method of obtaining velocity by means of
a rotating arm has been abandoned in meteorological work and in aeronautical
problems.(*) . :

Pitot Constant,” ‘Phil. Mag.,’ 21, p. 352, 1911; also in the ‘Report of the Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics,’ 1909-10, p. 15; 1910-11, ‘ Report,’ No. 34, p. 50, by Messrs, BRAMWELI. and SILLICK.
