Therefore, we may choose N and I’ so that €g is small as we want and q(x), on D5, is large as we
want.

3. Proofs

For reasons of space, we omit some secondary details in the following proofs; for instance we
do not write explicitly the definition of solution, the proof that energy and maximum principle
estimates are satisfied, the proof that we may pass from the weak to the mild formulation. We
only mention that the energy estimate follows by applying the Stratonovich calculus (the same as
ordinary calculus) to (1.3), while the maximum principle is a consequence of the fact that Q(x, x)
is non-negative definite for all x € D.

(a) Proof of theorem 1.2

The first key ingredient is the reformulation of the Stratonovich equation in It6 form

aT = («AT + £gT) dt +} wy VT AW,

where
(LoT)(x) = 7 uj(x) - V(uj(x) - VT(x)).

where we have also used the assumptions of uniform convergence of the series of the derivatives.
