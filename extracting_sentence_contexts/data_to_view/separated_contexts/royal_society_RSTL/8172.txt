8ays, © DE BLAINVILLE first connected Myriopoda with Annelida by means of the bristly
genera, the Annelida Errantia ; but subsequently remarked a closer connexion between
the two classes in the singular #uliform genus Peripatus.” De QuarReFaGesF does not place Peripatus with the worms, but in his * Histoire
Nat. des Annel6s” gives a short account of these animals in the Appendix. He dwells
on the fact that Peripatus has feet armed with nails, to which muscles are attached,
and not bristles lodged in a follicle. He considers that Ds BLANVILLE was near the
mark when he formed a special class © Malacopodes” for Peripatus, but that M. GERVAIS
was most in the right when he placed the group in affinity with the Myriopods. M. Ds QraTReFAGES was evidently quite right in following M. Gzrvais in this
matter.
