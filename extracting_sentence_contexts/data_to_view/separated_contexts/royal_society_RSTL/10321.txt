Owing to this, and to the most prominent plants flowering
And seeding early, and frequently shedding seed before cutting, their permanence was
Sfavoured. This was especially the case with Bromus mollts, which frequently produced

-Sthe other hand, the fact of this plant being usually annual, or biennial only, may serve
to account for the great fluctuation in its degree of prominence in the different seasons,
Edependent presumably on the climatal cireumstances having been favourable or other-
