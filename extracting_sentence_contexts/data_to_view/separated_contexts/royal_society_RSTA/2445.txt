the effect of gradully increasing the
“proportion of oxygen between the limits 2CH,+O, and CH,+0, was investigated. ‘SThe initial pressure was nearly the same (12°6 to 12°75 atmospheres) throughout
Sthe series. The most noteworthy fact brought to light was the total cessation of any
“gseparation of carbon after the proportion of oxygen exceeded the limit 3CH,+ 20,. 4 In interpreting the results given in Tables I. to IL. it is important to distinguish
e between (1) the primary oxidation of the hydrocarbon, which is an exceedingly rapid
> process, and is probably completed during the short interval between ignition and the
= ‘attainment of maximum pressure ; and (2) certain probable secondary interactions
g whose influence may extend far into the subsequent long cooling period.
