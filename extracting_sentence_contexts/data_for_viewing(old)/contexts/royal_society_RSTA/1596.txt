Figure 5. The erosion of the yellow amplitude basin in the parameter space (t, $2) are represented in the presence of a forcing
of amplitude F = 0.02. The colour bar relates the colour with the oscillations amplitude. Panels (a—d) show the basins for
[4 = 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05, respectively. (Online version in colour.)

we can see that for 4 = 0.04 the yellow basins is completely gone. In fact, figure 5 shows us, as
we increase the values of jz, the erosion of the higher amplitude basin. But, it also shows that
the effect of introducing a forcing is to create a yellow ‘island’ around 2 =1. This means that
near a specific frequency the forcing is able to counter the damping effects and to recover the
high-amplitude interwell oscillations. In figure 5c, where 4. = 0.04, we can see that still the small
high-amplitude island resists, and it is centred around that frequency value. So, we call it the
resonance frequency 2; = 1. It is interesting to note that this frequency value is different from the
max Observed in figure 2h. Now the yellow island disappears for 4 = 0.05, figure 5d, suggesting
a shift for the minimal value for which the interwell oscillations disappear when the forcing is
present.

Additionally, it is remarkable that the yellow amplitude basin (t € [3.8, 4.5]) is the only one that
seems to be affected by the presence of the forcing or the damping. This region is less stable and
