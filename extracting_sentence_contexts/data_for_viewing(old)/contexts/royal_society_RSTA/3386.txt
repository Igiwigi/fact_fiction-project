By enumerating all of the length-8 self-replicators, we were able to show that self-replicators
are not uniformly distributed across the fitness landscape and that viable genotypes cluster
together. The size of these clusters varies: there are a few clusters with many genotypes and many
clusters with a few genotypes, but the cluster size distribution has a gap. The edge distribution
of the clusters is similar to what has been found in random RNA structures, and the mean degree
differs between replicator types.

Genotypes with different replication mechanisms were in different clusters with no
evolutionary trajectory between the two. Empirical studies of RNA-based fitness landscapes,


biochemical model systems for the origin of life, also show that these landscapes consist
of isolated fitness peaks with many non-viable genotypes [19,20]. The fact that both RNA-
based landscapes [19,20] and these digital landscapes have similar structures suggests that the
evolutionary patterns we see in these Avida experiments may be similar to those one would
have seen in the origin of life on Earth. The presence of isolated genotype clusters in both
digital and RNA fitness landscapes further suggests that the identity of the first self-replicator
may determine lifeâ€™s future evolution, as other evolutionary trajectories are not accessible.
However, if populations can evolve larger genomes, non-accessible evolutionary trajectories may
later become accessible, as mathematical results on the structure of high-dimensional fitness
landscapes suggest [44].

To test for the effects of historical contingency in the origin of self-replication in Avida, we
evolved all of the 914 replicators in an environment where they could increase in genome size
and evolve novel traits. Previously, we found that the evolvability of spontaneously emergent : =
