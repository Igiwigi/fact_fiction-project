This implies
un" (xo) — U"*1(—x9) — (x0, (1 + De) = 0. We also compute
(Mlo)(x) = ppx + rlo(x)

which is affine in x. Using the convexity of u”, we then see that (5.9) implies

Lolo) — WOO) 5 Malp)(xp) = 0. 6.10)

Finally, we see that this implies (5.3), because
—}o7 9" (x9) =0

follows from the fact that g is tangent from below to the affine function Ip (because of (5.6)). Case 2: x_ finite and x4, = +00. We consider a sequence of points x“. — +00.
