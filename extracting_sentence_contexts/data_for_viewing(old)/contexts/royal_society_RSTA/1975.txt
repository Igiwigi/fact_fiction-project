We should like to know the behaviour of real substances at low temperatures, for instance,
in astronomy, where it is of interest to understand how condensed matter behaves in the cold
(approx. 3K) of interstellar space. One of the most abundant molecules in the universe is water,
and so theoretical work has examined how its solid phase, ice [20], should sublime at low
temperatures and pressures [21]. For example, one piece of work, interested in the possible
behaviour of ice on the Moon in permanently shaded craters near the lunar poles, where a typical
temperature might be 40K, found that ‘for temperatures below 70K, the sublimation rate of an

exposed ice surface is much less than one molecule of water vapour lost per square centimetre of :3
surface per hour’ [22]. There is not a great deal of experimental confirmation of the behaviour of : =
the sublimation curve approaching absolute zero. At the lowest temperatures, close to absolute : 8
zero, there is work on helium [14,23], as illustrated in figure 1 for helium 4. In fact, the behaviour i>
of the sublimation curve approaching the origin of zero temperature and pressure tangentially to : <
the temperature axis, in agreement with the thermodynamic argument presented above, has been : >
used to determine temperatures below 5 K from the saturated vapour pressure of liquid helium. 138

5. Localized excitations: solitons and discrete breathers 8

The initial work of Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou looked at low-frequency (long wavelength)
excitations of the chain of atoms. The responses of the system, the localized excitations in the
form of successive recurrences of states where energy was concentrated in one oscillator, were
