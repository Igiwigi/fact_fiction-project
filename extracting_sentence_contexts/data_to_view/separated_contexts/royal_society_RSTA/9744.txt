Since we have seen that, for
«(s, t) to be of positive type, it is sufficient that all the singular values of (7) should be
positive, we may now state the following theorem :—

In order that a continuous symmetric function « (s,t) defined in the square
asssb, astsb may be of positive type, it is necessary and sufficient that the

functions
$1, 8. Riss ay, s
»H(81j.9),, «(2 bs Ye le 2 eee A A Sart 5 (7 (i)
Sj, Se Si, Say +++) Sn

should never take negative values when the variables 81, 82, +5 8, ... each range over
the closed interval (a, b).

It may be remarked that, as a corollary of this theorem, we have the notable fact
that, if any continuous symmetric function is such that the integrals

are none of them negative, then the functions (8) have the same property.

§11. The properties of the determinants (8) may be used to obtain some idea of the
nature of functions of positive type. Let us suppose, in the first place, that there is
a point (a, a) belonging to Q at which one of these functions «(s,¢) vanishes.
