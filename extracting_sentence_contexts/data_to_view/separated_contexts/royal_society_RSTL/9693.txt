of mercury and a temperature of 15% C., the number 0:1124. According to
MAXWELL the viscosity should remain constant until the rarefaction becomes 80 great
that we are no longer at liberty to consider the mean free path of the molecules as
practically insignificant in comparison with the dimensions of the yessel. My observations show that this theoretical result of Maxwerr's is sufficiently near
the actual fact in air to confirm the accuracy of his reasoning, although there is a
variation showing that disturbing influences are at work which make the coefficient of
viscosity (taken as proportional to the logarithmic decrement) nob quite constant. The results are embodied in the following table and diagrams. The first half of Table I. gives the viscosity of air, in 80 far as it is represented by
the log.
