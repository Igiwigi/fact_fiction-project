We conclude that the blue detuned perturbation is more efficient, in agreement with
observations reported in [34,35]. We interpret that this detuning corresponds to the detuning
between the CS wavelength and the absorber cavity resonance. In fact, we have observed that
the most efficient perturbation is at the wavelength of maximal absorption when applied on the
absorber device in the absence of coupling with the amplifier device. In order to increase the
success rate, the perturbation has been amplified via an optical tapered amplifier (TA in figure 1)
for the following measurements. Other than the TA, the perturbation beam is so astigmatic
that it has to be corrected.
