Sproportionally rapid.

The enormous amount of rapid contraction at this period was, in the writer's opinion,
et by that deformation of the spheroid which hollowed out the ocean-bed to very
emuch the general outlines that we now see, and so assigned the general forms to the
gcontinents.
S 'This cannot be viewed at present as much more than a conjecture; still it is one not

Gunbroken over such vast areas, and which should give to the sections of both land and
ocean-bed their actual forms, which (without regard to mountain and valley) are but
vast flat, raised-up plains, dipping more or less abruptly down to equally shallow, flat,
saucer-like plains of occan concayity. Lateral thrust or radial pressure at local centres
seems here equally inapplicable. It is for the physical astronomer to investigate the
causes of this yery striking and obviously not chance-configuration of this deformation
on the surface of our globe. [It should also be remarked that a certain order in the
form of the land (coast-lines) and sea indicates that these are not the mere result of
8uperficial actions, &xuch as deposition, denudation, and local oscillations of leyel, but
