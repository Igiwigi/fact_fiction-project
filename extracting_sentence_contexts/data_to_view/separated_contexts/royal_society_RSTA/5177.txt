For astrobiology studies, carotenoids, other pigments and few other biomolecules were
suggested as biomarkers, compounds that can be detected by Raman spectroscopy in the frame of
future Mars missions. For detecting them in the frame of future Mars missions, the application of
Raman spectroscopy was proposed [38-40]. In fact, it was shown that on the Earth carotenoids can
unambiguously be detected in lichen encrustations [41-44]. More important for the future Mars
missions context, pigments were unambiguously detected in desert halite crusts (scytonemin and
carotenoids), bottom gypsum layers of halophiles microbial mats (spirilloxanthin), as well as in
microplancton inhabiting brines form salterns (bacterioruberin f-carotene) using miniaturized
instruments [23,45]. During laboratory-based studies, however, frequently carotenoids were identified (alongside
sometimes with other pigments) without the discrimination of the specific ones.
