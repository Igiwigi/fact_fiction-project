the inverse of a cone of revolution will be a quadrinodal cyclide.

Cor. 2, Since a cone of revolution is the enyelope of a yariable sphere which touches three planes, we infer
by inversion that a quadrinodal eyclide is the envelope of a variable sphere which touches three fixed spheres.

If in this mode of generation the points common to the three spheres be real, two of the four nodes of the
eyclide will be real and two imaginary.

If the points common to the three spheres be imaginary, the four nodes of the cyclide will be imaginary, In
this case it is evident the three spheres may bo inverted into three spheres whose centres are collinear; now the
envelope of a variable sphere which touches three spheres whos centres are collinear is evidently a ring formed
by the revolution of a circle round an axis in its plane. Hence the inverse of 8uch a ring is @ quadrinodal cyclide
whose four nodes are imaginary ; in fact, a ring formed by tho revolution of a circle round an axis in its plane
is a quadrinodal cyclide which has two imaginary nodes at infinity.
