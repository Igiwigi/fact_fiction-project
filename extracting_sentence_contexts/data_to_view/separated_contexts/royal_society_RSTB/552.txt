Hence should be recognised, whether as real
advance in knowledge, or as only incentive to further investigation, the importance of
the cumulative evidence of the last few yearsâ€”of which that furnished by the experi-
ments of HELLRIEGEL and Wiirarra is certainly the most definite and the most
striking, pointing to the conclusion that although chlorophyllous plants may not
directly utilise the free nitrogen of the air, some of them, at any rate, may acquire
nitrogen brought into combination under the influence of lower organisms, the
development of which is, apparently, in some cases a coincident of the growth of the
higher plant whose nutrition they are to serve. Such a conclusion is, however, of such fundamental, and of such far-reaching
importance, that further proof must yet be demanded, before it can be accepted as
beyond question. Should it be eventually fully established, it would certainly suffice

to explain facts hitherto not fully explained. On the other hand, should it not be
established, and a soil source of the whole of the nitrogen of the Leguminose be
conclusively proved, the facts of agricultural production would, it seems to us, be
equally well explained. To this point we shall refer again in our general concluding
observations.
