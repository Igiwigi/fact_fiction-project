pecting that the absorption was owing to the presence of car-
bonic acid, I introduced some lime water to a volume of the
expanded gas amounting to 356 measures, when they were
immediately reduced to 512. The contraction would probably
have been still more remarkable if the gas had been farther ex-
| panded before the admission of the liquid. The change in the
lime water was very trifling; but my friend Mr. Ruee, who
witnessed this as well as several of the other experiments, and
who is much conversant in the observation of chemical facts,
was satisfied that, after a while, he saw small flocculi of a pre-
cipitate on the surface of the mercury. This contraction of
bulk cannot be ascribed to any other cause than the absorption
of carbonic acid; for besides the fact that the colour of syrup
of violets and of turmeric, which I also tried, were not affected
by exposure to the electrified gas, I have this objection to the
absorbed gas being ammoniac, that no diminution either of
bulk or transparency occurred on the admixture of muriatic
acid gas with the electrified air; whereas ammoniac would

have been exhibited under the form of a neutral salt. When
water was passed up to this mixture of the two gases, there
was an absorption not only of the muriatic gas, but of some-
