Continued loading
increased the maximum relative strain energy to the point where the fracture initiation location
shifted from the weld metal to an area near the weld metal and base metal interface. This change
in location was a direct result of the weld and base metal nonlinear material responses and the
presence of the weld crown. This analysis also demonstrated that the defect was a less critical
feature of this system and the base metal would in fact govern fracture initiation. The analyses provided excellent insights into the role of these weld flaws in fracture initiation
and quantitative input into the ship maintenance decision process. They were based on the
material behaviours and fracture properties, and predicted weld flaw fracture initiation without
an a priori specification of location.
