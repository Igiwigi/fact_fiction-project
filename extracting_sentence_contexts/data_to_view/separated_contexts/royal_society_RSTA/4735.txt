For ft; <t < fy, the state is

3(X = x1 FE Hay) + (XK — a1 — + HOY). For t > tz, the state is
8(X = xy + t= Yay” (Y)) + 8(X = xp + F= ty)(bY”*"(). The possible outcomes of a (fictitious) stress-energy measurement at a late time t = T > fp are
thus either finding the photon heading along the first ray X =x) + t) — f and the system localized
in the support of yw, or finding the photon heading along the second ray X = x2 + f2 — tand the
system localized in the support of Ws. Suppose, for example, we consider a real world defined by the first outcome. Our rules for
constructing the system's beables imply that, for t < 2t; — f2, and for x = x1 or x2, we condition on
none of these outcomes, as all of them correspond to observations within the future light cone.
