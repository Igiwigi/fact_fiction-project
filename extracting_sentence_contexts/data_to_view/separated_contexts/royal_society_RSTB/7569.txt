The locomotion of non-migrants forms part of their
immediate feeding or mating activities, while that of the locust migrant does not, having
an uncertain biological effect which is discussed elsewhere (Kennedy, in preparation).

Moreover, if migrants travel farther, without being distracted by incidental features
along their route, than do non-migrants, it is their locomotory drive which not only impels
the migrants but which also prevents them reacting to the incidental features. This is
evident from the fact that when migration is slackening, but before the locomotion itself has
ceased, the migrants change their reaction to conspicuous external objects, from avoidance
of them to attraction to them (pp. 199 and 245). We must picture the steady locomotion as
the clearest expression of a generalized ‘drive’ or ‘mood’ (Tinbergen 1942) which expresses
itself also in the detailed reactions of the insect—or, as we might say, in the insect’s changed
‘attitude’ to the same external features. That is not to say that the change of ‘attitude’ is
determined wholly physiologically, by internal causes, and still less that it implies a con-
scious state.
