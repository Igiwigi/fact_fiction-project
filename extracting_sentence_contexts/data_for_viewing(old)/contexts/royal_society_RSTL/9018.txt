the number of the germs. If the number deposited were one an hour, we should haye
thirty millions a day sown in the tubes. Probably the average time necessary for
infection is very much less than an hour. At all events 30,000,000 of germs daily
would be an exceedingly moderate estimate of the number falling into our thirty layers
of tubes. This, moreover, would only be a fraction—probably a small fraction—of the
germs really present in the air, In his Presidential Address to the British As80ciation
at Liverpool, Prof. Huxrey ventured the statement that myriads of germs are floating in
our atmosphere. Untrained experimenters and rash reasoners haye ridiculed this state-

ment, In view of the foregoing calculation it, however, expresses the soberest fact
Indeed, taking the word myriad in its literal sense of ten thousand, it would be simple
bathos to apply it to the multitudinons germs of our air.

$ 27. Some Experiments of PASTEUR and their Relation to Bacterial Clouds.

Quite recently I had occasion to refresh my memory of PasTeuR's paper published in the
* Annales de Chimie ' for 1862. The pleasure I experienced on first reading it was revived
by its reperusal. Clearness, strength, and caution, with consummate experimental skill
for their minister, were rarely more strikingly displayed than in this imperishable essay.
Hence it is that during recent discussions, in which this and other labours of the highest
rank met with such scant respect, those in England most competent to judge of the
value of scientific work never lost faith in the substantial accuracy of PasreEUR. One
