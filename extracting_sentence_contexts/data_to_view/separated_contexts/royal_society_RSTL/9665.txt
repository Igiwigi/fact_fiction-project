With these favourable
80il-conditions, the plant takes up more from the atmosphere within a given time. But, how far it does s0 simply as a result of a more favourable condition of the cell and
Sap, due to a more favourably balanced supply of nitrogenous and mineral food, in-
dueing greater activity of a given leaf-surface, or how far it is that,. conjointly with
greater vegetative activity, there 1s, as there necessarily must be, also a constantly
increasing above-ground surface, and hence a complex and cumulative action, is a
question beyond the scope of our observed facts to determine. That the increased
as8imilation of carbon over a given area cannot be entirely accounted for by the 8nppo-
sition that the particular species of plants developed have a greater assimilative power
for a given leaf-surface than those they have replaced, would appear from the fact that,
when a given amount of nitrogen, as nitrate of soda and ammonia-salts respectively, is
applied for one and the same description of crop—barley, for exumple—there is also
found a greater fixation of carbon—that is more growth over a given area—under the
influence of the nitrate.

11. 275 lbs. Nitrate of Soda, with Mixed Mineral Manure, containing Potass; Plot 16. The next selection of results hows the effects of the mixed mineral manure with
only 275 1bs. of nitrate of soda per acre per annum ; that is, only half as much as was
applied on plot 14, and containing, of course, only half as much nitrogen as the
