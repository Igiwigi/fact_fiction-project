metrical distribution (7.e., its exposure to varying conditions of pressure and light
intensity), have been shown to have no significance with regard to the occurrence of
anural development, and since such development seems to be confined to this family
and its origin to be polyphyletic, it is very probable that it is to be correlated with the
outstanding peculiarity of the family, namely, its unattached sand-flat habitat and its
adaptation to such an existence.

Tf Table I is consulted it will be seen that of the nine species of known development
that live unattached, eight have anural development. Of anural species that are
attached there are but the small viviparous Molgula bleizi, recorded only from Roscoff,
and the large oviparous Molgula retortiformis, with its relatively large eggs. Of the
species that produce urodele larvee, all but one out of the fourteen listed here are attached
forms. Such facts are more briefly summarised below :â€”

Of viviparous forms 8 species are urodele, 2 anural.

Of oviparous forms, 5 species are urodele, 8 anural.

Of attached forms, 13 species are urodele, 2 anural.

Of unattached forms, 1 species is urodele, 7 anural.

There is accordingly not only a correlation between shore-living attached forms and
viviparity on the one hand, and sand-flat free-living oviparous forms on the other, but
there seems to be a corresponding association between the presence of urodele larvae
