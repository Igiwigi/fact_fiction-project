Tt is in fact by means of these comparatively simple canonical expressions that M. Here

@ real equation.

318. An equation (a, 6, c, ...Lx, y)*=0 is real if the ratios a: 6: c, &c. of the coeffi-
cients are all real. In speaking of a given real equation there is no loss of generality
in assuming that the coefficients («, 6, c, ...) are all real; but if an equation presents
itself in the form (a, 6, c, ...X, y)"=0 with imaginary coefficients, it is to be borne in
mind that the equation may still be real; viz. the coefficients may Sari an imaginary
Eommon factor in such wise that throwing this out we obtain an equation with real
Fefficients.
