This species in cultivation has foliage remarkably like that
of the Ocnothera Lamarckiana of bE VRixsâ€™ experiments, but with leaves somewhat
narrower, more pointed, and less crinkled than in that species. The flowers were,
however, small like those of O. biennis. It is proposed to call this species O.
paralamarckiana, not only on account of its resemblance to O. Lamarckiana, but also
because it produces numerous trisomic mutations, in fact, in a much higher propor-
tion than they have ever appeared in O. Lamarckiana itself. A full technical
description of this new species will be published elsewhere. Figs. 1 and 2 are from
photographs of typical plants of the 1933 culture in the rosette and flowering stages
respectively.
