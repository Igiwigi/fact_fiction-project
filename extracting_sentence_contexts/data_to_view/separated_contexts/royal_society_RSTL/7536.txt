The cerebral capacity is but, small, is
Sless than that of the 8kull from the Neanderthal cave, which in the development of the
Sregion of the frontal sinuses and superciliary ridge, closely resembles the old Batavian
8kull figured by BLUMExBAcH in his last * Decade,” No. LXTIL. A The conclusions which I deduce from the examination of the foregoing facts of the
human skeleton discovered in the Cavern of Bruniquel are as follows :—

They exemplify the distinctive characteristics of the human genus and species, as deci-
dedly as do the corresponding parts of the present races. They show most affinity with the oldest Celtic types, the cranium being oval, and

rather dolicho- than brachy-cephalic in its general proportions. The cranial capacity or brain corresponds with that of uneducated Europeans of Celtic

origin; and exceeds that of the average Australian aboriginals.
