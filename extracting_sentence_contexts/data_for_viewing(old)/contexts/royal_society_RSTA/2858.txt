fast and likely repeated during each major eruption event, and the stripping of forests and mass
wasting by the most extreme acid rain events would have had devastating effects on all life
on land.


(f) Wildfires as killers on land

There is considerable evidence for prevalent wildfires at the time of the PTME. These would
have looked spectacular, like the lava flows around the Siberian Traps eruptions, but their role
in causing global extinction might have been modest. Forest fires happen all the time, and may
devastate ecosystems locally or regionally, but life soon recovers and heals the scars.

In fact, wildfires were common throughout the Permian and right through to the PTB, and then
there is a long gap during the Early Triassic and much of the Middle Triassic, when fossil charcoal
is not reported, or was at least very rare, as were other indicators of fire, including inertinites and
pyrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [64]. Wildfire has been posited at the PTB at Meishan
in South China, based on abundant charcoal, black carbon and carbon spherules [14]. Wildfire can
kill directly as forests were burnt down, but most animals would have been able to flee. Wildfires
contribute to extinction also by releasing trace gases and particulates into the atmosphere that
can in turn influence atmospheric chemistry and climate. Further, wildfires remove forests and so
enable mass wasting and wash-off of sediments down rivers and into lakes and marginal seas.

Today, many ecosystems are beset by frequent wildfires, and yet they recover. Australia
today is perhaps the most fire-affected continent, and large proportions of the northern tropical
savannah landscapes are burnt [65]. Yet, much of the savannah biota is remarkably resilient to
