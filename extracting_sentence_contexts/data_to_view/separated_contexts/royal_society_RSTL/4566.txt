The novel scale of Solution Densities, which are suggested by the different dif-
fusibilities of salts, and to which alone, guided by the analogy of gaseous diffusion,
we can refer these diffasibilities. Liquid diffusion thus supplies the densities of anew
kind of molecules, but nothing more respecting them. The fact that the relations in diffusion of different substances refer to equal
weights of those substances, and not to their atomic weights or equivalents, is one
which reaches to the very basis of molecular chemistry. The relation most frequently
possessed is that of equality, the relation of all others most easily observed. In liquid
diffusion we appear to deal no longer with chemical equivalents or the Daltonian atoms,
but with masses even more simply related to each other in weight.
