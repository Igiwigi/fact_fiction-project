INTO THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHT-IRON PLATES. 691

found necessary, as the metal gave indications of weakness in consequence of the lap
being rather narrow. Another reason for enlarging the lap was a desire at the com-
mencement to begin with the least possible quantity, and by direct experiment to
ascertain the maximum distance which the plates should oyerlap each other in the
joints, and to determine the strongest and best form of uniting them. To these points
every attention was given, for the purpose of collecting the facts on which are founded
the tabulated results on that part of the sabject which treats of the comparative dimen-
sions of rivets and extent of the lap in reference to the thickness of the plates. In this
department of the inquiry will be found the depth of lap, diameter and length of rivets,
and the distances of holes for nearly every description of joint ; also the thickness of
the plate, with a column of strengths as deduced from the experiments.

If we examine the nature of the fracture in the foregoing experiments, it will be
found that the machine-riveting is superior to that done by the hammer ; the mean
of the three first experiments being to the mean of the fourth and fifth as 5:4. In
the eighth and ninth the strengths are nearly the same.

On comparing the strength of plates with their riveted joints, it will be necessary
