bone cell is as great as that of the epithelial cell, and if one grants not only the
viability of the transplanted epithelium, but also its power of extensive proliferation,
then, judging by analogy, the bone cell ought to show, as it has done in this instance,
equal capability of living and growing when transplanted. The smaller the graft
the greater the proliferation.

Bone GROWING IN SPONGE.

Is there any direct evidence to show that transplanted living bone actually grows
and proliferates instead of forming, like blood-clot, a passive framework for the
granulation tissue to penetrate, and which framework will then be absorbed ?

In this relation an interesting fact was observed, where a minute portion of bone
broken off from the deeper layers of a new osseous growth, far removed from any
periosteal connection, was found growing in the midst of a sponge filled with
granulation tissue.

After removal from the fibula of a central sequestrum, measuring 3 inches in
length, a hollow cylinder of new osseous tissue was left. Into this hollow cylinder
a piece of decalcified, aseptic, specially prepared sponge (Professor Hamiuronâ€™s
method) was being introduced, when it became entangled on an osseous spicule
projecting from the central aspect of the new bone into the lumen of the hollow
cylinder.

This spicule became embedded in the sponge so firmly that it was detached from
