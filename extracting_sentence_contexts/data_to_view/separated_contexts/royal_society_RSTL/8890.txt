This involves the following problem :â€”To remove a given quantity of matter from
one part of a sphere to another, the layers excavated or piled up not being greater than
k in thickness, 80 as to make 4/ D*+F? a maximum, the axes being 80 chosen as to make
B==0 If D', Y! be the products of inertia referred to other axes having the same origin
and axis of 2 as before, it may easily be shown, from the fact that D*+F*=D*+F7,
that D*+1? is greatest and equal to E* for that distribution of matter which makes
D'=0 and E' a maximum. * See Tnons0x and Tarr, Nat, Phil.
