However, it is misspent energy to seek the solution of the mystery of resegmenta-

segments has been met with before any Amniota came into existence, even long
before there was anything like a segmented vertebral column; it is ready in
Dipnoi and Holocephali, which have no segmented centra in their axial skeleton,
