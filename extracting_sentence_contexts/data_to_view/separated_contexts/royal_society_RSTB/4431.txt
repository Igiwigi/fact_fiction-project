In the experiments with work of 1056 kg.m. per minute we got unmistakable
evidence of the formation of lactic acid in several cases; the amount, however, did
not appear to be very great, while it seemed quite likely that in the later stages of
the work production and elimination of lactic acid were balanced. In neither of these
cases does there seem to be any reason for supposing that CO, would be expelled from
the body after the stop of the work out of proportion to the oxygen consumed. The facts seem to us capable of another interpretation. Whilst admitting that
there will no doubt be a tendency during the work to accumulation of CO, in the
active parts of the body owing to the amount of CO, held in the blood and tissue
fluids being dependent on the partial pressure of CO,, and that this excess will be
given off directly the work stops, the close similarity both in general character and in
rate between the diminution of the hyperpncea after stopping the work and the
diminution of the hyperpnoea when breathing is resumed after holding the breath,* or
when fresh air is breathed again after exposure to an atmosphere containing CO,f,
suggests the necessity of a deeper explanation. In the latter two cases the difficulty
was pointed out of explaining the gradual subsidence of the hyperpnoea without any
signs of marked periodicity of the breathing, unless the assumption was made that
the respiratory centre is itself charged up with more CO, than normal in consequence
of the rise of alveolar CO, pressure while the breath is held or air containing CO, is
breathed, and that the washing out of this excess from the respiratory centre when
the breathing recommences or fresh air is again breathed takes an appreciable time.
