If a camera/eye only rotates about its optic centre, these polar angles are
the only sensible way to describe the relative visual direction of objects in the scene, because they form a coordinate frame that is independent of the direction the
eye is looking (i.e. independent of the fixated point). (b) When the camera/eye translates (or, equivalently for binocular vision, going from the left to the right eye)
there are changes in these angles (change retinal eccentricity, App, and change in meridional angle, A@pg). Thus, the 2D coordinates of optic flow and binocular
disparity are derived from the natural coordinate system (perhaps the only logical coordinate system) used for defining visual direction in a freely rotating camera/
eye. (Reproduced from [36] with permission from Elsevier.). (Online version in colour.)
