the respired carbon at each time for the entire respiration flux of all terrestrial ecosystems. This
global backward transit time distribution can be characterized by its corresponding mean E,/(t),
median m)(t) and quantiles QO (t), where the subscript b represents backward transit time and a
is a percentile (i.e. mp(t) = QP (#)).
To assess how the shape of this global backward transit time distribution changes over time,
we define the ratio h(t) as a measure of homogeneity of transit times

The motivation for this ratio comes from the fact that for an exponential distribution the
median is the product of In(2) and the expected value. If the transit time distribution would have a
shape close to an exponential distribution, then 1 ~ 1 and the transit times would have the higher
degree of homogeneity. To better understand the concept of homogeneity in transit times, recall
that for a one-pool system in equilibrium, mean age and mean transit time are equal, and both
are exponentially distributed [8,11]. Therefore, the ratio h(t) gives an indication of how different
is the system from a homogeneous system with no differences in rates among pools. The ratio
h(t) also gives an indication of how different are the mean and the median transit times. Because
larger transit time values have a stronger influence on the mean than the median, decreases in h
over time would indicate increases in the contribution of older carbon to the total respiration flux.
Another metric to assess how homogeneous is the transit time for the entire terrestrial
biosphere system is the ratio of the mean backward transit time to the mean system age,
