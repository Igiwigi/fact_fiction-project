The particular elastic invariants :

will be of fundamental significance, subsequently. The first theme to be discussed in the paper is the following: give a finite functional basis for
the set of elastic invariants, and a similar basis for the measures of defectiveness. (I will be precise
about what is meant by a functional basis later.) These tasks were addressed in [11-14], and I note
that some of the results relevant to the first task can be read in terms of, and understood by means
of, Cartan’s theory of equivalence of vector fields, as set out by Olver [15]. The second theme (there are five in all) relates to the fact that two distinct crystal states may
not be elastically related to one another even if they have identical measures of defectiveness. I
say that, as in [11,12], two crystal states are related by (implicitly non-trivial) neutral deformation
in that case, and remark that the corresponding changes of state can be interpreted in terms of
rearrangements of vector fields, or ‘slip’. The equations that determine whether or not a crystal
state XY (cf. (2.1)) allows neutral deformation are partial differential equations for lattice vector
fields {I/,(-)} in a crystal state also defined on 2 € R,

2s ({I,()}, 2}. (2.8)

One solution of these partial differential equations is {I,(-)}, neutral deformations exist if there is
a solution {1/,(-)} 4 {Ia(-)}.
