status competition and the level of social inequality. The
paper concludes with a discussion of the results of our
model and their implications for understanding patterns of
fertility variation and fertility decline.

(a) Proposition 1: despite their egalitarian nature,
status affects both well-being and fitness in

small-scale societies

A review of the published data suggests that status hierarchies
may be present in all or at least most human societies [6,7]. In
fact, many researchers argue that status seeking is a basic
human motivation [8,9]. Most human societies have multiple
