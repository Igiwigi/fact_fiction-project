The capsizing of a ship is theoretically equivalent to the escape of a particle from a
potential well, which has wide applications in physics, chemistry and engineering. So, with no
loss to the Navy, I was able to cast my work in this wider framework. In fact my most cited paper
(see §7 about citations) is on chaotic phenomena triggering the escape from a potential well [41].

(g) Importance of writing books

A book can be thought of as a solid structure built of many of our ‘brick’ modules, and indeed
a series of papers can often evolve into a book. Like the bricks themselves, this structure helps
writers to organize their material, and put it into good, preserved, order. Many researchers have
said to me that they needed to write a book, even if just to keep their own files in order.
