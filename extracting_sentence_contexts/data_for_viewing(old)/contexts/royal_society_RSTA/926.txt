theory [19], as well as for stochastic partial differential equations [20-23]. LDT uses the dynamical


equations to approximate the asymptotic behaviour of the tail for any given up-crossing level 4 |
by identifying the most probably initial condition that corresponds to a trajectory that crosses

this level. This involves the solution of an optimization problem in the high-dimensional phase â€œ3
space of the dynamical system, which can be expensive to solve. Moreover, the method provides :8
information only for the tail of the PDF and not its full form. ig

In this work, we rely on a blended data-equations perspective that uses a small amount of data as : a
well as the equations of the dynamical system. This is motivated by the very nature of extreme :&
events as described above, i.e. the fact that they form due to the synergistic action of randomness {2

and dynamics and to this end we need information for both. The data information represents a
rough description of the underlying stochastic attractor or set where the system lies most of the

time (brown-shaded region in figure 1a) and is expressed as a small number of samples or second- : &
order statistics. The equations, on the other hand, are used to collect information for the instability Dos
regions (green-shaded region in figure 1a), such as growth rate or trajectory information for these : =
domains of the phase space, associated with strongly transient dynamics. Note that data-driven : a
approaches may also be used to recover the dynamics for extreme event regions, allowing for the : 2
formulation of purely data-driven (equation-free) approaches that use the presented ideas. This aes
is a very important topic that will be treated in the future. 22
