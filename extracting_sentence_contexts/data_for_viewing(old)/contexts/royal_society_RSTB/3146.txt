The mesoderm bands of the Polygordius arise so late, relatively, in development,
in comparison with the head-kidneys, that their consideration hardly comes within
the scope of the present research. From the time the head-kidneys become
functional until the appearance of the mesoderm bands, there is a short period in
the larval life-history during which the larva undergoes considerable change in
shape; this is brought about by the formation of the anal papilla, which gives
it a more conical outline. Its examination, shortly before this change tikes place,
indicates that the mesoderm bands have not yet appeared. Careful examination
of the anal region shows the presence of two large nuclei, one on either side
of the anus, which probably represent the rudiments of these structures. These
nuclei or cells are very unlike the teloblasts HarscHex (8) has described as giving
rise to these bands, and at no later period of development can I ever find them as
well marked as indicated in his figures. His figures, 57, 58, and 59, in fact, are
very misleading in this respect.

The real pole cells of the mesoderm bands, if such we can call them, lie close under
the ectoderm, against its inner surface, almost touching the gut. They are most
satisfactorily seen in ventral views of the larva seen en face, and are conspicuous
for their large dark oval nuclei and lack of surrounding cytoplasm. These nuclei
are the same as those seen in fig. 13 behind the rudiments of the nephridial cells.
In side views they are seen against the gut, as shown in fig. 30. As the
larva changes from the condition shown in fig. 13 to that of fig. 30, these cells,
I believe, move backwards till they take up their position finally against the gut.
Close to these cells, but not to be confounded with them, are two large cells seen
side by side on the surface of the ectoderm. They are clear and vacuolated,
