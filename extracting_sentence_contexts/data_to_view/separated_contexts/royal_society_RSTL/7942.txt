It would be interesting to know the exact value of Â« for an
infinite tube projecting into unlimited space free from obstructing bodies, the thickness
of the cylindrical tube being regarded as vanishingly 8mall. Heixmonrz has solved
what may be called the corresponding problem in two dimensions ; but the difficulty in
the two cases s8eems to be of quite a different kind. Fortunately our ignorance on this
point is not of much consequence for acoustical purposes, because when the necks are
short the hypothesis of the infinite plane agrees nearly with the fact, and when the necks
are long the correction to the length is itself of subordinate importance. Nearly Cylindrical Tubes of Revolution. The non-rotational flow of a liquid in a tube of revolution or of electricity in a similar
solid conductor can only in a few cases be exactly determined.
