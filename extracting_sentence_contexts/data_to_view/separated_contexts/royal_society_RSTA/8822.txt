Certain displaced sets are given in the tables. If 23418 is ‘5 less (dA = 08) the
¥», vs become exact and it is F,(3)(4A’,). The numerical proofs of these allocations are
not given, as these displacements have no importance at present beyond the fact that
they exist.

m= 4. Direct lines are found for F,, n = 1, 2, 4, 6, whilst 5 appears displaced
+5°01 = 2x 2°50, to observed lines 26265, 26275. There is also a line 26067 ahead of
26065 by 2°51.
