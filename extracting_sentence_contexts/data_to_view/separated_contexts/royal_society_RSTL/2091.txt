the animal to which the sand adheres ; and hence, when the
worm is dug up, this part is generally found to be covered
with an imperfect arenaceous tube ; within which the mo-
tions of the body are performed with perfect freedom, but
which cannot be removed entire. This tube is in fact left
behind in the progress of the animal, and forms a complete
lining for the hole, which it supports, and keeps pervious
through its whole length. The worm is thus enabled to as-
cend readily to the surface, and the water is admitted freely
to the branchiz. A few of the anterior rings of the Arenicola progressively
diminish in size, and each admits of being completely folded
within the ring immediately behind it.
