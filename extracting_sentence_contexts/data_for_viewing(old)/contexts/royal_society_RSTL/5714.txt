Syhich connect the anharmonic ratios. The equation in fact expresses a certain relation

E win four sets (z, 3, y, 3) and four other sets («, BY, 3,); a relation which may
e termed the relation of the homography of the anharmonic ratios of four and four
ts: the notion of this relation is also due to M. CnASLEs.

may be exhibited in a great variety of forms. In fact, if the determinant is denoted by
L, then multiplying by this determinant the two sides of the identical equation
