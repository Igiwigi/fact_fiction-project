it is extended inwards and forwards, in the form of a broad nipple-shaped protube-

rance, the orifice of which is opened behind in the middle line. This protuberance

(fig. 37.) is situated above, and a little behind, the two large outlets of the systeric

arteries (w), through which the blood is transmitted to the sides of the segments.
The reason for this imperfect structure of the valves may perhaps be explained by the
fact that the blood is distributed from the heart in the Scorpion in opposite directions,
partly backwards to the tail, but chiefly forwards and outwards to the head and sides,
as in the Myriapoda, and hence it may be necesary that a reflux of the blood should
not be entirely prevented, as may be required in those instances in which the whole
current is in one direction. This also may be the reason for the valves being formed
more transversely, and less completely than in insects. The structure of the organ is
exceeding thick, opake, and muscular. It is formed of two layers of fibres, longitu-
dinal and circular in each layer, the most powerful of which are the latter. On its
internal surface it is smooth, and lined by an exceedingly delicate membrane. through
which the strong circular fibres are distinctly marked. It is by means of these that
its most powerful contractions -are effected, the auricular action being chiefly the
result of the relaxation of these fibres, assisted by the reactions of the lateral muscles.
