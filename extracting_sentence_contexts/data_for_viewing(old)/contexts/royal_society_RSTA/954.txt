Proof. The proof of this statement if well known (e.g. [23, §1.5, Whitney’s theorem] or [24,
statement 7.1]), but we still want to briefly explain some of its steps to reveal important underlying
phenomena. The first step is to find x, y,4, @ without touching H and F.

Lemma 2.5. Under the above assumptions, there exist local coordinates x,y,a,g such that
(x, y, 4, 9)|p = (0,0, F(P), 0) and

H=4(P +p +da)y+a(Q)), FHA, (2.3)
where a(A) and b(A) are real-analytic functions with b(F(P)) = 0, b’(F(P)) £0.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that H(P) = F(P) = 0. First of all, we need to kill one
dimension using the fact that H and F Poisson commute. As dF(P) 4 0 we can choose a canonical
coordinate system p1,91,p2,q2 such that F =qz. As H and F commute, we conclude that H does
not depend on py, i.e. H = H(pi,q1,42). Thus, p2 does not play any role, so we may forget about it
and continue working with p1,q1,92-

Let us now think of H as a function of two variables q; and p; depending on q2 =A as a
parameter. We have 9H/dp\|p = 8H/4q1|p =0 and, without loss of generality, 7H/dp{|p #0. We
are now in a quite standard situation in singularity theory.

By a parametric version of the Morse lemma, the function H can be written as H = +(x? +
f(q1,4)), for some new local variable x =x(p1,q1,4) such that x|p=0 and dx/dp; 40. Now,
condition (ii) of the definition of a parabolic point is satisfied if and only if the function f(q;,0) in
one variable q; has order 3 at the point q;|p. Hence, this function can be written as a for some
