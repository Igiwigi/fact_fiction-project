The
graph is sparse because only those similarities that are above a certain similarity threshold are
retained. MCL performs random walks from every vertex (protein) in the graph. It exploits the
fact that most of these walks will be trapped within tightly connected clusters, hence driving up
the probability mass that is accumulated within each cluster. In order to avoid densifying the
intermediate matrices and making the computation infeasible, MCL performs various pruning
strategies that are shown to not hurt the quality of the final clusters [39]. The simultaneous random walks directly map to a sparse matrix primitive that is commonly
known as SpGEMM, which computes the product of two sparse matrices.
