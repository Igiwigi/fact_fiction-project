BS Þ. Variations from day to day. N
E Nearly all obseryers have found that the absolute quantities recorded on any day
Fil not correspond with those' of other days; but as the inquiries were not made
Hnder precisely the same external cireumstances, it was not possible, with certainty,
assign any cause to which the variation could be attributed. It would not
erhaps be unreasonable to presume that, with identity of external cireumstances
<n successive days, the system would not vary in any appreciable degree ; but a
Terence to Plate XXXIV. will show that whilst in not a few instances the quan=
ties obtained were constant, in many others the variation from day to day in the
ount of carbonic acid amounted to half a grain, and in a few to even one grain
Per minute ; and that this was not due to any error in the inquiry, may be inferred
from the fact that, when a food was under examination which did not vary the
respiratory changes, the same numbers were obtained in sevyeral 8uccessive experi-
ments within from one to two hours. Hence we must search within the system for
the explanation, and we shall find reason to believe that the nature of the night's
rest, and the amount of nutriment remaining in the system, cause yariations in the
amount of carbonie acid expired in the early morning, before food has been taken,
On many occasions I noted these conditions at the time that I made the experiment. Thus I passed a restless night on April 7, June 1, 16, 18, 23 and 24; had short night's
Sleep on April 24 and 28; was not well on April 15, 16, May 8, 18, June 14, and
