The smell of the pure explosive gas somewhat resembles
that of burnt sugar, mixed with the peculiar smell of oxymu-
riatic gas. Water appeared to take up eight or ten times its
volume ; but the experiment was made over mercury, which
might occasion an error, though it did not seem to act on the
fluid. The water became of a tint approaching to orange.

When the explosive gas was detonated with hydrogene,
equal to twice its volume, there was a great absorption, to
more than +, and solution of muriatic acid was formed ; when
the explosive gas was in excess, oxygene was always ex-
pelled, a fact demonstrating the stronger attraction of hydro-
gene for oxymuriatic gas than for oxygene.

I have said that mercury has no action upon this gas in
its purest form at common temperatures. Copper and anti-

Â®* In page 245 of the Phil. Trans. for 1810, I have mentioned that the specific
gravity of oxymuriatic gas, is between 74 and 75 grains per 100 cubical inches. The
gas that I weighed, was collected over water and procured from hyperox, muriate of
potash, and at that time I conceived, that this elastic fluid did not differ from the
oxymuriatic gas from manganese, except in being purer, It probably contained some
of the new gas; for I find that the specific gravity of pure oxymuriatic gas from
manganese, and muriatic acid is to that of common air, as 244 to 100 Takir'g this
