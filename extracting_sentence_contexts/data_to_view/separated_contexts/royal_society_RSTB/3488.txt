An examination with a pocket lens shows that each separate group consists of two
distinct parts, a densely aggregated central region tapering downwards to more or
less of a point, and a lighter, less populated region around it (text-fig. 1, 4-8). Under a low power of the microscope, it can be seen that this dense central mass
consists of cells apparently falling downwards; the lighter region consists of cells
swimming irregularly upwards (Plate 36, fig. 52). If kept in the dark, the Euglenz continue to exhibit this phenomenon of
â€œaggregation for several days, until they die, in fact. In one series of experiments
I found that the length of time during which the aggregations persist varied from
four to eight days, but during these periods a large number had become rounded off
and settled to the lower side of the tube, and during the last two days the
