selenium remaining in the salt-cake did not amount to 1 per cent. of that mixed with
the sulphuric acid at the commencement of the process, so that the salt-cake process
gets rid of most of the selenium as well as the arsenic.

It is possible for some small trace of selenium to get into the black-ash furnace.
If it does, it is presumably in the condition of free selenium, sodium selenate, or
selenite. Now the trace of free selenium will probably be volatilized to a great
extent, and pass off with the other gaseous products. As for the selenite and
selenate an experiment to be described indicates that they will be decomposed,
yielding free selenium, with which some of the lime will form calcium selenide.
We find, however, calcium selenide is decomposed when suspended in water by
carbonic acid gas yielding free selenium, but not a trace of selenium hydride. These
facts were established as follows :â€”

About 4 grams of precipitated chalk were converted into calcium selenate, and this
was reduced by hydrogen (pure) to calcium selenide. During the operation much of
the selenide decomposed into free selenium and lime (?), and there was a considerable
evolution of selenium hydride. The process was stopped while the evolution was in
full progress. On washing the contents out of the tube we probably had a mixture of
free selenium, calcium selenide, calcium selenate, and perhaps other products, A
stream of carbon dioxide gas (pure) was passed through this mixture, including the
water, contained in a set of potash bulbs, and as a result a large quantity of selenium
was deposited, but not the slightest trace of selenium hydride could be discovered
either by the smell of the emergent gas or by heating the delivery tube red-hot.
