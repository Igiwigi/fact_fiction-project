The INWORK report presents
the global floating offshore wind foundation development in the USA, Europe and Japan [8]. According to this report, five full-scale floating offshore turbines are planned to be installed in
2014, two in 2014/2015 and three in 2015, worldwide. Despite the fact that a number of these
solutions are available in concept [8-10], a complete understanding of the behaviour of floating
platforms is not present and still demands significant investigation [11]. These offshore structures
have widely variable and complex dynamic responses due to intense and complex environmental
loading dominated by high wind and wave forces at the locations of their operation [12-15]. Monitoring of this complex dynamics is important for offshore wind energy solutions because
the exposure to wind, wave and combined wind-wave loading can be widely variable [16-19]
and may lead to significant practical issues for successful implementation of this technology at
its site [20,21].
