From what has been above stated, this quantity must be a maximum with respect to 9,
considering {, //, and g* as constants. This gives
â€”p.8in 8+ cos8=0.
* The tendeney of the tangential differential motion of two particles very near together, to bruise or dis-
locate the mass, will manifestly depend on the contortion or twisting produced by this relative motion, and
therefore on the angular change of position of the line joining the two points. Thus, in fact, 2 is the quan-

tity to be really made a maximum. This is equivalent to considering g constant in differentiating as in the
text.
