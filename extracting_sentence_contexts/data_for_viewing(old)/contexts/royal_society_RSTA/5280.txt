the synchronization of oscillators on a limit cycle can be thought of as the same phenomenon,
if the extended nature of the spatial coordinate is ignored and only the spatial phase
is considered. Implementing light-mediated atom-atom interactions opens the possibility
for tunable and controllable realizations of long-range interacting and mean-field models for
synchronization [20], and indeed this was exploited in [7,21] to connect the viscous CARL
dynamics to the Kuramoto model for synchronization of coupled oscillators [22]. We show in the
following that this connection is not limited to CARL, but applies also to the symmetry-breaking
transverse instabilities studied in [15,16]. Moreover, the connection made in [7,21] referred to the
case where strong damping is present in the system (hence the denomination ‘viscous’ CARL),
which in the Kuramoto analogy translates into the case where the oscillators have zero natural
frequencies (their distribution is a Dirac delta function). We extend here the Kuramoto analogy
to the situation analysed in [15,16], where no damping is present and a finite spread exists in the
natural frequency spread of the fictitious oscillators.

2. Single-mirror optomechanical instabilities

(a) Basic scheme

We consider the single-mirror set-up [23,24] depicted in figure 1, where a cold gas of two-level
atoms is illuminated by a pump beam of amplitude F, frequency w) and wavenumber ky. The
pump beam is detuned by 6 = a9 — wat from the atomic transition (frequency wat, linewidth I’),
and is retroreflected by a mirror of reflectivity R placed at distance d from the cloud to form the
backward beam (amplitude B). We can thus envisage a situation where fluctuations in the atomic
spatial properties can modify the refractive index distribution in the atomic ensemble and in turn
the phase profile of the field. These phase fluctuations are converted into amplitude fluctuations
