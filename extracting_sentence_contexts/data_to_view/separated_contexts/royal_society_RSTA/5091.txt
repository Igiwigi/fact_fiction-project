A broad overview of the scaled FOWT tests performed so far can be found in Miiller
et al. [38].


5. AFOSP experimental campaign and results

Particularly during early pre-design of a FOWT, the outlined Froude scaling approach may be
unnecessarily complex and cost-intensive, as it requires a wind turbine model with redesigned
blades and access to a large combined wind and wave basin. Owing to the fact that typically
an existing wind turbine is chosen for a developed floating substructure, the focus of the
early experiments can be placed on identification of global system behaviour in terms of
platform eigenfrequencies, RAOs and tower base loads as well as tower top displacements and
accelerations during typical operational and extreme load cases. To establish these quantities, the
rotor thrust force may be modelled by simpler approaches ranging from concentrated masses
with added point forces [50], drag discs with a rotating body [4] to real-time controlled thrust
actuators (so-called software in the loop (SIL) approaches) [51,52].

(a) AFOSP experimental set-up

The RAO and wind—wave tests for AFOSP were performed at the CIEM (Canal d’Investigacié
i Experimentaciéd Maritima) wave flume at the Laboratory of Marine Engineering at the
Universtitat Politécnica de Catalunya, which is 100 m long, 3m wide and up to 7 m deep. Figure 6
shows a descriptive diagram of the experimental set-up.
