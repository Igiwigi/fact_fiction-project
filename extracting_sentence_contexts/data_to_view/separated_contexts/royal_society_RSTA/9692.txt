The
authors, therefore, feel justified in saying that both the end of the eutectic line and
the maximum of the heat evolutions along the line IL are consistent with the
existence of a definite compound Al,Zn;. The determination of the position of the point H and of the curved portion of the
solidus from H to D, having been based entirely on microscopical evidence, will be
described in connection with that portion of the work, and we pass on to consider the
line of points shown on the diagram in fig, 4, mostly lying within the area CDHG. It will be seen that these points lie on a perfectly smooth curve, starting from the
temperature 638° C., at which a minute heat evolution is observed in most varieties
of aluminium, including the comparatively pure variety used in preparing the present
series of alloys.*

Samples of aluminium have, however, been obtained which do not show this heat
evolution, and this fact would suggest that the thermal change in question does not
occur in the purest varieties of aluminium, but that its occurrence is determined, and
its intensity accentuated, by the presence of certain other elements. One of the
authors, in a recent research on the alloys of aluminium and manganese, found a series
of small heat evolutions starting from this temperature in nearly pure aluminium, and
continuing at the same temperature, but with increased intensity, with successive
additions of manganese until the concentration of the point Mn;A1 is reached. In
the present series of alloys the addition of zine also appears to intensify the heat
