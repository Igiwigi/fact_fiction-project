Gritys, to make special search
for Lepidostrobi, which we 8oon succeeded in discovering, and at a more recent period
Mr. GrevE has forwarded me additional specimens. They are all of one species, which
fact is important, since it leaves little, if any, room for doubting that they belong to the
same Lepidodendroid plant as that whose stems and branches constitute the great mass
of the deposit.

'The general aspect of longitudinal sections of these strobili is that common to Lepi-
dostrobi. They usually have a diameter of from less than half an inch to nearly an inch ;
each sporangium extends from the central axis to the periphery, exhibiting in the longi-
tudinal sections the form, s0 prevalent amongst these fruits, of an oblong parallelogram. In one of these sections now before me I count sixteen vertically disposed sporangia in
an inch of the length of the Lepidostrobus.
