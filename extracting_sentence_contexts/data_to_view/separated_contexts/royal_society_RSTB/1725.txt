The
lobes were, no doubt, each sub-divided into segments in the horizontal plane (see
Photograph 18, figs. 26 and 27; also Wiutamson’s fig. 29), but only the stumps
of these segments remain. The lower lobe appears to have been the broader, for at
several places in the radial sections it is shown in its full extent, where the upper
lobe is either missed altogether, or only partially shown (Figs. 24 and 25), The
lower lobe was often, perhaps always, trifid, receiving the three anterior branches of
the leaf-trace ; the upper lobe appears to have been more frequently bifid, receiving
two bundles only (see Photograph 18, and fig. 9), but sometimes this also received
three bundles, as shown in Fig. 27. That this is really an upper lobe is shown by
the fact that its bundles do not separate until quite near the periphery. Owing to the paucity of the sections of the pedunclet and their frequent obscurity,
it has not been possible to work out the course of the bundles with the same minute-

ness and certainty as in the axis of the cone. Enough, however, is shown to prove
that their course and subdivisions follow the same general rules as in the axis, with
