Proof. Uniqueness of the solution follows since the difference of two solutions of (iaCP 4s)
solves the homogeneous problem (aCP 4s) for the initial value up = 0. In case Lf =g the function
u defined in (5.1) gives a solution of (iaCPy4s). This follows immediately from the fact that
u(t) € D(A®) implies that LA,,u(t) = Bu(t) for all t > 0. a

(c) Decoupling for analytic semigroups

The problem (aP2) consists of two differential equations where the second one describes, by
means of the boundary operator B : D(B) Cc X > 3X, an interaction between the state space X and
the boundary space dX.

The aim of this section is to ‘decouple’ this problem, i.e. we show its equivalence to a
system consisting of two independent Cauchy problems: the first one on the space Xo = ker(L)
of functions having zero trace governed by the operator Ag with abstract Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The second one on the boundary space 0X governed by a Dirichlet-to-Neumann
