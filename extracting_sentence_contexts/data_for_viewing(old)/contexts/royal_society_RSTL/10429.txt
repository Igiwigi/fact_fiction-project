> yentral axis of the bud has a constanb position with reference to the primary polyp,
which is shown in fig. 184*; a-p represents the long axis of the primary polyp, and
dâ€” the dorso-ventral axis of the bud. The latter cuts the former nearly at a
= right angle, but is always inclined slightly forwards (4 represents the anterior
& extremity of the axial polyp).

T will add a brief account of the habits of the young colony at this stage.
Tf the creature be left to itself it gradually comes to a state of rest, burying the
= peduncle in the sand. The body always assumes nearly the same position, the dorsal
8ide (as determined by the interior structure) being held upwards and the buds extend-
Z ing horizontally on either 8ide. The anterior part of the main polyp, with its crown
2 of tentacles, is directed obliquely upwards and forwards. This position is maintained
S throughout all the following stages, and this is, I believe, a fact of the greatest import-
ance which stands in causal connexion with the bilateral syrmetry of the organism.
The tentacles of the axial polyp may at this stage be entirely retracted into the
anterior part of the body. This is effected by the invagination of the oral end of the
body, the tentacles being at the same time strongly contracted. When fully
expanded they are held nearly horizontally with the outer portion curving gently
backwards. When the polyp is hungry the tentacles are moyed actively back and
forth, 80mewhat after the fashion of a Synapta, but without regularity. If supplied
with food, such* as Gasteropod veligers, the tentacles close eagerly upon it, and
i is held for gome time closely clasped by them. They are then taken into the
c80phagus and passed in a bolus down to its lower portion where they remain for
some time, the lower opening of the cesxophagus remaining tightly closed. The
