Tn the first place it will be noticed that in all cases the ratio is much less than
when no salt is added to the solution. At optical thicknesses above 450 up, the
number varies on each side of unity, giving no evidence of a change in specific con-
duetivity. This is proved by the films numbered 2, on July 11 and 12. At thicknesses
between 200 and 450 p.n., the ratio is generally above unity, being in some cases as
large as 1°27 or 1°28. It is, however, to be observed that there is no clear indication
of an increase in the ratio as the film thins, The value corresponding to the smallest
optical thickness is not the greatest in the cases of film 2, July 12, and film 4,
July 11, and is actually the least of those furnished by measurements on film 3, ;
Faly 11.
sy The optical and electrical measurements of the thickness of black films formed of
#28 per cent. solution are in as close accord as the nature of the experiments will
yermit, the electrical being as a matter of fact rather the smaller of the two. Thus,
fom Tables VII. and I., we get 10°6 p.y.,and 12°4 p.p., for the mean electrical and optical

icknesses respectively. The discrepancies between the individual experiments are
tZo great to enable us to insist on the accuracy of this difference, but it is evident
téat there is no such striking divergence between the results of the two methods as
i@remarked when no salt is present.

We have tried from time to time to obtain some measures of the electrical thick-
= of films formed of a solution containing 3 per cent. KNOs, at thicknesses inter-
ediate between that corresponding to the black and 200 p.p. Such observations
Gould be very valuable in helping us to decide whether there is.or is not a real
Saximum of specific conductivity at about 100 p.n., which is suggested by the fact
