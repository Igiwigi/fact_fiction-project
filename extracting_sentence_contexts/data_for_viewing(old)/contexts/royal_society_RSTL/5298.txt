is one of the earliest facts in molluscons development, and it has a corresponding
influence over their whole organization.

The Archetypal Vascular System and its modifications —It may be questioned
whether the © archetypal” heart has a single or a double auricle, but it is certain
that in proportion as the symmetry of the branchial apparatus and of the whole body
is preserved, we approach to the form of heart with a double auricle. Thus we have
a double auricle in Chiton and Haliotis, and a close approach to it in Tethys, Janus,
and the Folide.

In the Cephalopoda the contraction of the branchio-cardiac veins has been
observed by Mitxe-Epwarps and KGrukKeR, 80 that they may be considered to be
auricles. This is another curious illustration of the fact, that what is commonly
considered the most concentrated and highest organization does not occur in the
reputed highest forms of Mollusca.

The heart lies above the intestine, and gives off the aorta anteriorly. This
runs forwards through the cephalo-pedal ring with the cesophagus, and terminates
eventually in the buccal mass. Its main branches may be classed as visceral and
pedal.

It is needless to enter here upon the beautiful discoveries of M. MiLxNz-Epwarps,
with respect to the incompleteness of the circulation in the Mollusca. The facts I
