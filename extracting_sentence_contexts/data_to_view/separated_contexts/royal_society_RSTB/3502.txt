The aggregations described in the
present paper are, however, as I shall endeavour to show, not due to heat, but are
in large measure the mechanical result of the action of gravity combined with cohesive
forces acting upon organisms heavier than water. In the first part of the paper a description is given of the movements of Euglena
and the various experiments made to determine the conditions under which the
aggregations of this and similar organisms occur. The second part contains a general
discussion of the facts observed and the conclusions drawn from them. Evetena Vrripis.
