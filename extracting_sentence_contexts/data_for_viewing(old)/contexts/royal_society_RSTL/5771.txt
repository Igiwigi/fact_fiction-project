22. The only explanation of this phenomenon hitherto given, and adopted apparently
without hesitation, is that of M. AGass1z and the Messrs. ScHLAGINTWEIT. These
observers attribute the phenomenon to the diathermaney of the ice which permits the
radiant heat to pass through the substance, to heat the bubbles of air, and cause them
to melt the swrrounding icef.

The apparent simplicity of this explanation contributed to ensure its general accept-
ance; and yet I think a little reflection will show that the hypothesis, simple as it may
appear, is attended with grave difficulties. [

23. For the sake of distinctness I will here refer to a most interesting fact, observed
first by M. A6as81z, and afterwards by the Messrs. SCHLAGINTWEIT. In the © Systeme
Glaciaire*Þ it is described in these words: © I ought also to mention a singular property
of those air-bubbles, which at first struck us forcibly, but which has since received a
very satisfactory explanation. When a fragment containing air-bubbles is exposed to
the action of the sun, the bubbles augment insensibly. Soon, in proportion as they
enlarge, a transparent drop shows itself at some point of the bubble. This drop, in
enlarging, contributes, on its part, to the enlargement of the cavity, and following its
progress a little, it finighes by predominating over the bubble of air. The latter then
swims in the midst, of a zone of water and tends incessantly to reach the most elevated
point, at least if the flatness of the cavity does not hinder it.”

24. The satisfactory explanation here spoken of is that already mentioned: let us
