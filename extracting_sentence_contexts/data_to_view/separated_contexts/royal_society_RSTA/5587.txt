Numerically, we examine the ML closure on a simple test model, the Lorenz â€™96 (L-96) system, 3 |
that was first introduced by Lorenz [26] as an idealization of atmospheric waves in midlatitude. While the model is simple, it carries some properties of realistic turbulent complex systems 3
[27,28] such as the energy preserving advection-like nonlinear term, and a wide spectrum of oS

unstable modes through the nonlinear coupling between states. Beyond the simplicity, which
allows us to carry the numerical verification with moderate computational costs, our choice to
investigate this case is largely motivated by the fact that closure models for a coupled system of
the mean and covariance statistics have been well developed and improved in [4,9,28]. These
parametric closure models, developed based on clever physical intuition, have demonstrated
accurate statistical predictions. In such a configuration, we found that the ML-based model can
produce accurate statistical responses (comparable to the parametric model) on moderate to large
forcing amplitudes.
