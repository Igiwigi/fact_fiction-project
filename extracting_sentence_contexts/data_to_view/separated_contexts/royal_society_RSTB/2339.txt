As stated above, this “seed,” like the
others figured by WILLIAMSON under the same name, is no doubt our Lepidocarpon Lomazi, but from the
nature of the specimen the evidence as to the presence of endosperm is inconclusive. OF FOSSIL PLANTS FROM THE PALASOZOIC ROCKS. 311

signs of archegonia. I could not, however, satisfy myselt that this specimen is really
a Lepidocarpon, though the fact that the nucellus or sporangium is free from the
integument down to its base is in favour of this attribution. From WILLIAMson’s
remarks,* it appears that he referred this specimen to his Cardiocurpon Butterworthi,
which, from its cylindrical stalk, must have been of quite a different nature from a
Lepidocarpon, and may rather have been related to the true Cardiocarpon of
Bronentart and Carrutuers. In any case, the nature of Writtamson’s prothallus-
containing seed must for the present be left an open question.
