The most commonly used technique today is fluorescence microscopy, which
can be used to visualize the dynamics of a protein directly in a living cell or
organism [5]. Fluorescence microscopy can provide detailed information
about the localization and the dynamics of a macromolecular complex, and
over the past years there has been an increase in single-molecule-based
techniques that can provide insights into the structural conformation of a
protein [6,7]. However, the level of detail is limited by the fact that the signal
comes from the fluorophore used for detection rather than from the target
protein (figure 1). An alternative method to analyse the cell is electron tomography (ET), and
although it provides a more static image, the details are at higher resolution
compared to fluorescent microscopy. ET can be performed either on fixed
and stained samples or under cryogenic conditions (cryo-ET).
