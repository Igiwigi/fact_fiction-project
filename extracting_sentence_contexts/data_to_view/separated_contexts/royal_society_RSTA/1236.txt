Regardless of whether either explanation is responsible, the discrepancy between current
models and observations of Uranus is intriguing and might provide useful insight to coupled
tropospheric-stratospheric dynamics and coupled stratospheric dynamics and chemistry. To make
further advances in this topic, an additional way to break the strong degeneracies between
temperatures and abundances in mid-infrared emission observations would be valuable (e.g.
spatially resolved measurements of the S(1) quadrupole line of Hz—as will be possible with
JWST [172]—to help constrain stratospheric temperatures, in situ temperature measurements
from probe(s), better derivations of stratospheric CH, vertical and meridional distributions at
visible and near-infrared wavelengths that are not so degenerate with temperature), as would
additional observations that target the stratospheric distributions of hydrocarbons.

(c) Effects of external material

Oxygen-bearing species such as HO, CO and CO are present in the stratospheres of Uranus
and Neptune [31,33,34,47,51-53,58,60,78]. Any CO2 and H2O being carried up from the deep
troposphere on Uranus and Neptune would be expected to condense long before reaching the
stratosphere, and although CO does not condense and can have a deep tropospheric source, the
fact that the mixing ratio of CO is greater in the stratosphere than the troposphere on both planets
indicates a source from outside the planet. Delivery of oxygen from the ablation of interplanetary
dust particles is the right order of magnitude to explain the observed amount of HzO, CO2 and
CO in the stratosphere of Uranus [148,173], but cometary impacts or local satellite/ring material
could also contribute [52,148,149]. For Neptune, the expected dust influx rates are far too small
to explain the large observed amount of CO in Neptune’s stratosphere, pointing to a very large
cometary impact within the last approximately 1000 years [42,53,58,60,148,150,173].
