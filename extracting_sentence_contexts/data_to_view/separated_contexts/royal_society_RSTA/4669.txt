We note significant enhancement
(about 3 orders of magnitude) in the conductivity of electrons in the z-direction in this superlattice. Importantly, at room temperature the electron transport, and thereby the conductivity, is
determined by a wide range of electronic states with energies separated by a value of the order
of kgT. Thus, the fact that conductivity enhancement is large demonstrates that the metamaterial
effect is ‘broadband’ on the scale of the energy fluctuations determined by the thermal agitation,
and hence is not due to a resonant effect. In subsequent works, we have further demonstrated that
the paradigm of transformation optics may allow bulk materials to be designed with an isotropic
zero mass and a giant nonlinear response [32], and to have a ‘perfect lens’ for electron waves [33]. Furthermore, the proposed ideas, in particular the extreme anisotropy regime, can be extended
to graphene electronics [34,35].
