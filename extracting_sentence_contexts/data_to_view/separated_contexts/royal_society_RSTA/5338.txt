Though of frequent occurrence in the neighbourhood of Oran, and not
uncommon in Algeria, there is no record of them in the provinces of Constantine
and Tunis. Ordinary surface breccias continue, however, into the former province. These facts would seem to imply that, as on the coast, of Asia Minor, the depth of
the submergence decreased eastward, but closer investigation is needed (see Map). Egypt.â€”It may be a question whether the submergence extended beyond the
Lybian desert. There is no well-defined evidence in proof of it in Egypt, for the
breccia described by General Prrr-Rivers near Thebes,{ and in which he found
chert or flint implements, does not appear to be a Rubble-drift, though it possesses
some of its characters.
