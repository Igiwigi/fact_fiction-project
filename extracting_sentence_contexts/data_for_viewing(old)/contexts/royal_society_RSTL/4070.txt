pedo can till give the shock either voluntarily, or from external irritations.

We also know that if one of the electric organs of a living torpedo be rapidly de-
tached, we can still obtain the discharge on irritating one of the nerves ramified
within the organ.

We have also shown, some time ago, that on acting upon these nerves with the
electric current, we obtain the discharge under the same conditions and the same
laws as those under which we have muscular contraction on acting upon the mixed
nerves. Hence the remarkable analogy found to exist between muscular contraction
and the electric discharge of fishes.

The most singular and the most important fact in a theoretical point of view is the
discharge which we obtain when we take a very small part of a prism of the electric
organ of the torpedo, and irritate it in any manner. Electric discharges always take
place, as is shown by the contractions of the galyanoscopic frog.

I have very lately repeated this experiment in a variety of ways, and have always
found that, on irritating one of the small nervous filaments distributed to the organ.

we obtain the discharge from that small portion of the organ into which the nerve
penetrates. We have thus eyery reason to conclude that the electric organ of the
