The conserved quantity Q generates the symmetry in the sense that, under an infinitesimal
symmetry transformation, the change in any field ¢ is given by the commutator

$o(t,r) =ielO(t r), QI], (5.7)

where ¢ is an infinitesimal parameter. The fact that the symmetry is spontaneously broken means
that there is some field ¢ whose vacuum expectation value (0|¢|0) is not invariant under the
transformation, i.e. (0|[, Q]|0) 4 0. However, if Q is time-independent, this can happen only if
there are possible intermediate states with zero energy in the limit of zero momentum, in other
words massless particle states. The development seemed to have reached an impasse.
