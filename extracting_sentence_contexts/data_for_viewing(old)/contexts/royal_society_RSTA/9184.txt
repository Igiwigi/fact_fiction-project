sathe greatest change of angle observed, are also equal ; or to express it differently, the

‘replacement of K by Cs is accompanied by twice as much angular change as that of

7K by Rb (average changes K by Rb, 23’, and K by Cs, 47’, maxima 57’ and 119’),

Ejust as the change of atomic weight Cs—K (= 93) is double that for Rb—K (= 46).

-2 The amounts are so large as to be entirely removed from any possibility of error,

Z which, on a generous estimate, cannot exceed 3’,

> The second main fact is illustrated by the closeness of the structural dimensions
= (those of the unit cell of the space-lattice) of the ammonium and rubidium salts, the

E rubidium salt being the intermediate metallic salt. So very close are the total
"= volumes of the cells (the molecular volumes, for the Rb salt 216°96 and for the NH,

& salt 216°53) and their edge-lengths (the topic axial ratios), that the crystals of the

"3 two salts are practically iso-structural, that is, their space-lattices are congruent,

3 practically identical, capable of being represented by the same model on any scale
within reason.
