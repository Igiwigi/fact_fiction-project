Hilbert saw the role of axioms 73
for physics as a way to put it on a firmer footing, or, in his words as quoted in [4], to support and : XS
fortify ‘when signs appear that the loose foundations are not able to sustain the expansion of the 22
rooms’. The metaphor here was that science is a growing edifice of different rooms in which the [4
different branches operate. The physics here is already out there, we approach it patchily and then : *
mathematics has a retrospective clarifying role, although also an explanatory role if, ideally, one : =
finds axioms that lead to exactly the physics that is observed. :8

In fact, Hilbert took the view that mathematics in general is ‘not like a game whose tasks
are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules’ [4,6] but rather that good axioms are part of
a pre-existing structure of ‘mathematical reality’ as I would put it. In my experience, many
mathematicians would also agree with this, although many would not. For example, the French
mathematician Dieudonné [7] famously argued the other side—that mathematics was more like a
game of chess in which there is no absolute truth because the rules are arbitrary.
