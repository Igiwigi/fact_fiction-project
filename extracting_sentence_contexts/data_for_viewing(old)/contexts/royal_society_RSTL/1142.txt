different proportions, the greater proportions are multiples of the
less by an entire number.

A different view of the subject has lately been taken by
the ingenious author of the Bakerian Lecture, published in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1820. In that paper, Mr.
BRANDE has endeavoured to prove, that the gas called light
carburetted hydrogen, or simply carburetted hydrogen, or
hydro-carburet, is not entitled to be considered as a distinct
Species; that the only aeriform compound of charcoal and
hydrogen, which is with certainty known to exist, is the gas
called olefiant, or bi-carburetted hydrogen; and that the
gases evolved by heat from coal and oil, are in fact nothing
more than mixtures of olefiant and simple hydrogen gases
in various proportions.

In assuming, in the first Essay, the existence of light
carburetted hydrogen as a definite compound, characterized
by its requiring, for the complete combustion of each volume,
two volumes of oxygen, and giving one volume of carbonic
acid, I relied on the sole authority of Mr. DaLron ; for the
gas of marshes, though before known to be inflammable,
had not been subjected to accurate examination by any other
chemist. Mr. CRUtcKSHANK, indeed, speaks of it as © pure
hydro-carbonate;””* but since he classes it in that respect
