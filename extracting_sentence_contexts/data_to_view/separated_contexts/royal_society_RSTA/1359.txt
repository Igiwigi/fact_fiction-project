The
Segre cubic locus corresponding to II contains the five associated planes of V,° corre-
sponding to the points P,,..., P;. { It is in fact generated by all the lines which meet
any four and therefore the fifth of these planes; for such lines correspond to cubic
curves through P,, ... , P;, and just one of these curves passes through an arbitrary point
of Il. Any four points of ¢; determine a prime II ; so that there is just one Segre
cubic of the system YY which contains four given planes of V,°, and that is generated
by all the lines which meet those four planes. Recapitulating then: To points of cs
correspond, in X, a V,° of planes; to five points of cs lying in a prime correspond five
associated planes of V;°; and to the prime itself corresponds a Segre primal containing
these planes.§ and determined by any four of them.||
