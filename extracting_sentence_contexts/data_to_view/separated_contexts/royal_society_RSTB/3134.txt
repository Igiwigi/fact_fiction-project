It is, moreover, always lined on its inner foetal surface by a layer of cells separating
it from the blood sinuses. The position of the nuclei is towards the foetal surface. This fact, together with the absence of anything like a basement membrane on the
maternal side leads me to conclude that it is the advance edge of the trophoblast and
not the uterine epithelium. The staining reaction also suggests the same interpretation. Within this comes a mass of trophoblastic cells honeycombed with spaces (Z.) filled
with maternal blood, which increase in size nearer the inner edge, and here may be
seen to open into much wider sinuses, the innermost walls of which are quite thin.
