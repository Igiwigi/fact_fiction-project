only once, but it has not been particularly sought for. Frequently, however, has the
existence of snch a mass been observed with the same mulberry-like form. And in
repeated instances the vesicles of the mass, more or less separated, have exhibited
the tremulous motion above mentioned. In one instance the motion was com-
parable to that observed in separate globules when in the neighbourhood of cilia in
motion.

287. It has been remarked by Professor Burpaca-f, that © the mammiferons ovum,
not only in its form, but also in its vital relations, resembles a hydatid,” The re-
semblance, however, was probably not conjectured to be 80 very close as from the
above facts it appears to be. (Compare Plate IX. fig. 151. with several of the figures
in Plate VI.) It remains to be discovered whether the mulberry-like structure with
its germ in the oyum of Mammalia, also performs rotatory motions. The thought
that it may do 80 has naturally suggested itself, from the striking resemblance in
form, composition, and locality} of that structure in the mammiſerous oyvum and the
nterine yesicles in question.

288. It is known that the embryos of a number of Mollusca, as well as the germinal
granules of some Polypes, &c., perform rotatory motions. We are indebted to Pro-
fessor GraxT for some very interesting facts on this subject. Several obseryers have
noticed this phenomenon in the ova, or yelk-ball, of certain animals. An instance of
its occurrence in the latter appears to have been observed by LEEUwENAork in 1695,
but the sabject claimed little attention until revived by Carus and E. H. WrBen.
