5 which is transitional among the higher vertebrates, is here permanent. These endo-
A skeletons are nearly all what may be termed chondriform. The two processes of

growth being essentially different, it is desirable to apply to them distinet and in-
telligible names, and thus avoid the necessity of employing descriptive phrases every
time that each one is referred to: the terms chondriform and membraniform appear
sufficient for this purpose ; the former being employed to designate those calcareous
growths which are formed within the substance of the true cartilage, and the other
being applied to the analogous growths which are formed by the calcification of
laminze of fibrous membrane. I would first direct attention to some examples of
chondriform bone, as constituting the simplest type of true osseous structure.

Several writers have recorded the fact, that in the Plagiostomous fishes the carti-

forming the os8eous covering of the cartilaginous skulls of the Sharks and Rays;
but neither of these authors bas noticed the minute structure of these plates, or re-
cognized their true physiological relationship to other forms of ichthyal and mamma-
lian bone. Professor OwEN, in his admirable lectures, advances somewhat farther ; he
