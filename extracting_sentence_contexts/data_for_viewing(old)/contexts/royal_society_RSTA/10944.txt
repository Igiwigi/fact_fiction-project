in default of cross-fertilisation ? We might have expected a high degree of homotyposis
in the field bean or the tare vetch, where failing cross-fertilisation we are told there
will be self-fertilisation. We find on the contrary, however, in these results some of
the lowest homotypic correlations of the whole series. The sweet pea also in its two
series presents some very remarkable results. If the sweet pea be entirely self-
fertilised then we should expect the homotyposis of both ovules and ripe seeds to be
fully up to the average. In neither case is such a result reached, although in one
series we have a value for the ovules higher than that obtained for anything
except the broom. The noteworthy fact, however, is that the results for the two
series of sweet peas differ so widely in character! In the first series it is the
abortion which is most individual in character; in the second series it is the ovules.
In the first series the ripe seeds have far less individuality than the aborted seeds,
in fact, the smallest homotyposis I have yet observed ; in the second series the ripe
seeds have a value rising to ‘2, which is higher than that of the aborted seeds. Ash

trees from Monmouthshire, Buckinghamshire, and Dorsetshire, gave results in good
agreement ; but sweet peas from two different nursery gardens in the same district
give strikingly divergent homotypic correlations !

According to Darwin (‘The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation,’ 3rd edition,
p- 153) the sweet pea “in this country seems invariably to fertilise itself.” He bases
this statement on (a) the difficulty of access to bees and other insects, ()) the fact that
