* The tendeney of the tangential differential motion of two particles very near together, to bruise or dis-
locate the mass, will manifestly depend on the contortion or twisting produced by this relative motion, and
therefore on the angular change of position of the line joining the two points. Thus, in fact, 2 is the quan-

tity to be really made a maximum. This is equivalent to considering g constant in differentiating as in the
text. 724 MR. HOPKINS ON THE THEORY OF THE MOTION OF GLACTERS.

Let 0, and 0, be the two values of 8 which satisfy this equation ; then
[
tan 0,= tan 0, ==;

and :
=; o
8; =itan 'Z +180 q

From the above expression for v, 0, gives Â» a poxitive value, and 0, the same numerical
value with an opposite sign, the one being the algebraical maximum value, the other

the minimum one.
