ing power of at least six or seven reiterated interior reflections,
all of which may be seen through the side of the prism, had
any share in the production of these streaks, I fixed on one
side of it a glass, of which the lowest surface was emeried,
and on the other a metalline plain mirror, but found that the
streaks were both in number and colour perfectly alike in
them all.

By this account it is evident that the streaks derived from
the blue bow contain not only the colours of the blue reflected,
but alsv those of the red transmitted part of the spectrum.
This fact is a clear indication of the office which is performed
by the surface of the subjacent plain glass, which is simply
that of reflecting back the rays of the transmitted red part of
the spectrum, which being mixed with the blue part, both
together, by their intersections, produce the observed streaks,
as will be explained hereafter.

That the colours of the transmitted part of the spectrum are
reflected back into the prism, is a point which I suppose will
be admitted ; but if it should be imagined that the red rays in
the streaks of the blue bow might come into the prism by a
scattered reflection of the light which falls on the plain glass
under its base, then I say that a sheet of white paper or double
