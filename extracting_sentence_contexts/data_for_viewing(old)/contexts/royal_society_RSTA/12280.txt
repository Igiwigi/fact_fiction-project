(1.) As the depth of water in the calorimeter increased, the work expend
forcing the tubes through the water also increased ; and the rate of rise in temper
ture (which ought to have diminished) was much greater when the mass of the water â€”
was large. .

(2.) This change in the quantity of heat developed would not have been fatal, sin
it could have been determined separately for each mass of water used, and we pe

capriciously, even when the mass of water and rate of revolution were constant ; al
we have never arrived at any satisfactory explanation of these variations. It appe
probable, however, that their origin was due to differences in pressure between #
