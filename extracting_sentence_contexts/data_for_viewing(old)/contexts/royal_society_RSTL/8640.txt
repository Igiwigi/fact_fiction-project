very clearly shown in the chart for July (Plate XLVT.). The greater part of Centra
India and the whole of the Lower Provinces, together with Lower As8am and Cachat
have now a mean temperature below 85*. But the Punjab and the Bikaneer desert Â«til
range aboye 90%. The highest temperature is that of Rawul Pindee, where the fall fron
June amounts only to 24*.

From July to October (Plates XLVI. & XLVIL.) the temperature gradually decline:
in such measure that by the end of September or the beginning of October it is nearl
equalized over Northern India. In the Central Provinces, indeed, and in Rajpootang
also at Calcutta and some other stations in Bengal, there is a slight rise of temperatur
in September just before the rapid fall sets in.

To sum up the above facts briefly. The distribution of temperature in Norther
India presents three very distinct phases, corresponding to the three seasons alread
defined. In the cold weather two loci of minimum temperature are situated in th
Punjab and Upper Assam, and there is a secondary locus of abnormally low temperaturt
extending apparently from Bareilly to Benares. With this exception the general cours
of the isothermals conforms more nearly to the parallels of latitude than at any othe
SCAaSON.

In the hot weather a temperature focus is found in Central India, and the upland
and plateaux south of the Ganges and eastward from the Sahyadree mountains haye'
temperature considerably higher than that of the Gangetic plain, the maritime belt, 0
the surrounding seas. The Upper Punjab and Upper Assam are still the coolest part
of our area.
