Proposition VimThe apparent thickness, as measured by the electrical metho
different black films formed of an unsalted solution is very variable. In
cases, at all events, this is due to a real variation in thickness.

The results given above are sufficient proof of the apparent variability o
thickness of the film.

The best proof that this variability is sometimes real, is the fact that we |
distinctly seen two different shades of black in the same film. NerwTon recogâ€™

one occasion asked us whether we have noticed the same phenomenon. So

tint is but slight and may easily be overlooked, but in many cases a definite lu
demarcation can be observed between the two tints, so that we can certainly
