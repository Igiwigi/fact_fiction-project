Z has recently done the sameF. The results of the observations by PrevosT and Dumas,
S QuarreFaces,and myself, although differing greatly in detail, coincide with the general
5 results obtained by SyaLLanzant,—that only an exceedingly small quantity of seminal
A influence, and consequently only a very limited number of vibratile spermatozoa is
=D necessary to effect impregnation. They agree, too, in the fact that the number of

£ eggs impregnated is always much fewer than that of the spermatozoa supplied to

S them; and, consequently, that there is reason to think that fecundation is not the

result of a single, isolated spermatozoon, although it has not been ascertained what
-2 is the number actually required. The course I have pursued in putting this curious
Z question to the test, has been different from that of either of the distinguished

5 naturalists mentioned. It has not been that of diluting the impregnating fluid in a

8 very large quantity of water, and then applying a minute drop of the water to the
= Frog's egg, as done by SPALLANZANI ;—nor has it been that of reckoning the number
E of spermatozoa on a given surface of a micrometer plate, and then immersing the
& plate in water with a quantity of eggs, and afterwards observing how many of them
Z became fecundated,—the course followed by Prevosr and Dumas ;—nor has it been
s byestimating the number of spermatozoa in a given bulk of fluid, and then ascertain-
S ing the number of eggs fecundated by them, as done by QuaTREFacts with those of
= the Hermella and Teredo ; but it has been by direct application of the spermatozoa
on the point of a pin to the surface of a single egg in a glass cell; and then observing
beneath the microscope the number of spermatozoa deposited from the point of the
pin, applied in a similar way as to the egg, on a plate of glass.
