I would be glad
ro find this out, but I doubt that all my little Search
will not be able to do it. 1 will proceed as far as I
can. Let us ſuppoſe, in the firſt Place, the North to be
intirely paſlive, and that all the Variation of Cold
and Heat is owing wholly to a DefeRt, or Exceſs, in
the South-weſt Wind : So that, when the South-weſt
blows, it ſhall be always warm; and, when it ceaſes
to blow, it ſhall be ever cold. If this be Fact, then
it will follow, that whilſt the South-weſt blows with
the ſame ſteady Gale, the Weather ſhall be of the
fame Degree of Heat: But we find it otherwiſe ; for
the Nights, in a mild Winter, are colder than the

Days, the ſame South-weſt till blowing 3 therefore
Cold, with us, is not wholly owing to a Slackneſs
of the South-weſt Winds. Let us now ſuppoſe the Privation of the Sun's Heat
to. be the only Cauſe of Cold: The Conſequence
will be, that all Places equally diſtant from the Sun,
will be equally cold. But it is well known, that, in
the ſame Northern Latitude in Europe, Cold is
greater on the Continent than in Iſlands : Therefore
Privation of the Sun's Heat is not the only Cauſe of
Cold.
