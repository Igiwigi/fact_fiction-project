If the length of the cantilever is L, it follows that

L My,

oq = 8407 a7 (15-10)

The value of y for the case in which the cantilever remains elastic was shown by Reissner
(1904) to be 4-090. YIELDED MILD STEEL BEAMS 235

A calculation with n = 20 for the case in which ‚Äù = 1-0 and the bending moment at the
encastered end was equal to the fully plastic moment gave the value 3-980 for y, so that the
reduction in L/2d as compared with the value calculated on the assumption of elastic
behaviour was only 2-7 %. The small effect of yield in this case is due to the fact that the
reduction in B occurs near the encastered end of the beam, where the angle of twist, and
consequently the secondary bending moment, is small. 16. EXxPERIMENTAL WORK

Owing to the difficulty of obtaining suitable specimens of steel strip of sufficient length,
the experimental work was restricted to the case of pure bending, which of all the cases
considered involved the use of the shortest specimens.
