The sphere, therefore, acts on external particles precisely as an infinitely small magnet

of moment -- Cx Y*F held in the direction of the lines of force. Here we may pause to observe the very remarkable fact that while the effect of a thin
rod or plate magnetized in a direction parallel to itself is nearly proportional to z, the
effect of a plate magnetized at right angles to its plane, or of a solid sphere, is almost
independent of the value of z,

Thus, taking WEBER's obseryations, the values of z for steel and soft iron are nearly

would therefore haye more than seven times the effect of a steel rod or plate of the same
dimensions ; but in the case of spheres the proportion of the effects would be

or the effect of the hardest steel sphere is within 4 per cent. of the effect of a similar
sphere of s0ft iron, and within 5 per cent. of the effect of a similar sphere of a substance
infinitely susceptible of induction, and hammering such a sphere would make no per-
ceptible difference in its effect. At the equator outside, and anywhere in the interior, the force of the sphere, as we

this force therefore would, within 5 per cent. in the case of a steel sphere, and within
1 per cent. in the case of a soft iron sphere. neutralize the effect of the earth's magnetism.
