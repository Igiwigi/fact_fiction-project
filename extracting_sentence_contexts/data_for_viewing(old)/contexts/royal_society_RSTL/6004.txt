recorded in the Transactions of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society for 1856, in
the rate of the functions on five persons of different sexes and ages. A low and uniform
state of system is therefore the characteristic condition in a prolonged fast; and it is
very like that which occurs with food at the end of the interval between the meals. It
has also been shown that in a fast of this duration the quantity of carbonic acid does
not progressively diminish, but is the same at the end of twenty-seven hours as it was
at the end of 44 hours.

There is therefore a state of the system which is nearly uniform under all the circumÂ»
stances of the day, when the body is uninfluenced by exertion or the primary proces8es
of digestion, and which may be called the basal or normal state. From this but little
can be taken away; and the additions must be due to exertion or the temporary influ-
ence of compound aliments. This I shall subsequently show to be a fact of mach
interest and importance, since it will be proved that certain substances which, as food,
must contain nutriment, do not increase the products of respiration over this basal line;
whilst others, including all compound aliments, do produce an increase.

The great uniformity in the state of the system during fasting renders that period
particularly fitted for the determination of the numerical relations between the carbonic
acid, air inspired, and rate of pulsation and respiration, and also as a basis with which
to compare the influence of food and other agents. The law before mentioned in refer-
ence to myself was well exemplified in this experiment; for the cubic inches of air
inspired are very nearly represented by the half of the product of the pulsations and the
respirations. There was 1 gr. of carbonic acid to 52:5 cubic inches of air; which if
we consider it as a normal, the proportion with food is less and with exertion is greater.
