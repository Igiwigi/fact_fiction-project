That part of the Selachian palatoquadrate lying anterior (medial) to the orbital pro-
cess (“‘ Oberkieferfortsatz ” of German authors), appears to have been entirely lost in
bony fishes. The portion of the palatine cartilage anterior to the ethmopalatine arti-
culation in Amia, Lepidosteus and the Teleosts, must, therefore, be regarded as a new
formation, and this view is supported by the fact that this part of the palatine chondri-
fies independently in Amia and certain Teleosts. Further, in view of the fact that in
Amia, Lepidosteus, and in several Teleosts, this part of the palatine is continuous with
the ethmoid region of the neurocranium during the early stages of development, it is
possible that it has been derived from the cartilage of the cranium itself and has become
secondarily detached. Lunpsoret has shown that in certain bony fishes the cell

* Their anterior ends are linked together by a small median copula in certain sharks.
