stimulating the same hemisphere.

The foregoing two selected experiments illustrate the conditions which are observed
with the hemispheres in a normal state. Before considering the further evidence
afforded by massing our observations, we must draw attention to the greatest
difficulty in connection with this branch of enquiry, and which prevents us from
speaking so positively upon this point, when the results noted at the beginning of
any experiment are added to those recorded at the end, We refer to the great
tendency of the cortex to become hyperexcitable after one or two excitations, and,
consequently, for the excitatory state to pass from one hemisphere across to the other.

This is especially liable to occur when through repeated excitation the cortex has
been thrown into a hyperexcitable state. This is, in fact, the objection which may
be urged against any conclusions derived from massing together results, many of
which being repetitions involve previous excitation. The same objection can also be
urged with equal truth against the results of most of the observations of earlier
experimenters ; but upon the question whether this objection accounts for the whole
of the results to be immediately given, we have no means of expressing any decisive
judgment. It is, however, easy to understand that a considerable proportion of the
bilateral effect noted in the two halves of the cord when all the results are taken
may be due to this circumstance.

The average amount of the bilateral effect obtained in the two halves of the split
cord when one hemisphere is directly excited is as follows :â€”
