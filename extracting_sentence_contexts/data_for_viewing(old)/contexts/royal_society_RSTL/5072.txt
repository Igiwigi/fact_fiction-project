is also frequently confounded with that of Jeast intensity, although they represent
different phenomena, and occupy different positions on the globe. By some authors
the terms © pole of intensity ” and * pole of verticity ” have been introduced, by which
ambiguity is indeed avoided ; but, whilst the term © pole ” is retained, it must be ad-
mitted that in one of the two instances at least, it is used in a sense which (what-
; ever may have been its earlier signification) is inconsistent with modern definition
from high authority (that of M. Gavss), and with that general understanding of its
meaning, which has grown up under the hypothesis, imagined by some natural philo-
sophers and now known to be erroneous, that the magnetism of the globe is analo-
gous to that, of a sphere of soft iron rendered magnetic by induction. The points of
maximum of Force have also been called * foci” or © centres of Force,” terms how-
ever which have not been suffered to pass without objection. In papers strictly
limited as these Contributions are to investigations into the facts of terrestrial mag-
netism, I have thought ir preferable to employ expressions, which although they may
bave the real disadyantage of appearing somewhat awkward, especially when they
come to be frequently repeated, are subject to no ambiguity, and are obviously un-
connected with any hypothesis.

In advocating the consideration which, in a general view of the earth's magnetism,
appears to be due to the points in each hemisphere which form the centres of the
systems of isodynamic lines, and are themselves points of greatest Force, —and to the
circle or curve which encompasses the earth and unites the points in each geogra-
phical meridian where the magnetic force is weakest,—I am far from desiring an
undue importance to be attached to them, over the points where the needle is ver-
tical (or its inclination is 90*,) and over the line where the direction of the needle
