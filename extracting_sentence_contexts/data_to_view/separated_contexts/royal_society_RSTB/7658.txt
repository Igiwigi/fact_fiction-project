The success of experimental neuroscience has brought
with it a problem very similar to that faced by these other biological disciplines. The quantity and complexity
of relevant data, and their dispersion through an extensive literature, make it very difficult to derive reliable
conclusions about the information they collectively bear about the nervous em. An example of the
the problem is provided by the fact that more than 14 000 reports of connections between the different gross
structures of the rat brain have been reported in the past 20 years (Burns & Young, this issue). Data so
numerous and complex provide ample opportunity for the derivation of false hypotheses if treated informally,
simply through the ease with which inconvenient data can be overlooked or forgotten. These complex and
numerous data plainly require analysis in order to develop and substantiate hypotheses about the organization
of the rat brain.
