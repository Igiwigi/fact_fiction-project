62 DR. PHILIP ON THE NERVOUS AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS

parts which receive the nerves proceeding from them, become subject to every
part of the brain and spinal marrow.

Such being the case with respect to the ganglions and plexuses, it is not
likely that we shall find the nerves themselyes, whether ganglionic or cerebral,
capable of supplying any part of the influence they convey; but that nothing
may be taken for granted, this als is a point which must be determined by an
appeal to facts.

It is to be recollected that here, as in other cases, the onus probandi rests
with the asserter. This would still be the case, although his position were less
improbable than that, while there is an evident and acknowledged source of
neryous influence, and that adequate to the production. of the phenomena,
another source of it should exist. Those who maintain such an opinion must
adduce the proofs of it. Let. us inquire to what they amount.

While the connexion of the neryes with the brain and spinal marrow exists,
the nerves are capable of exciting the muscles, causing the evolution of caloric
which supports animal temperature, forming the secreted fluids from the blood,
and supporting the other processes of assimilation by which the structure of
