but also included forms with round, flat, elliptical and tetrangular valves. It seems
therefore likely that the subspecies distinguished by taxonomists (see Hustepr 1930)
forma biangulata and forma tetragona, with oval and tetrangular valves respectively,
represent variations of the same type.

In cultures with many cells produced from auxospores there also occur forms which
show a close resemblance to what is described as Ditylum sol Grun., the marginal
ridge being more undulated, with several longitudinal lines showing up in girdle view,
without the collar of small spines and with triangular valves, the sides of the triangle
being slightly concave. As the distinction of this species is almost exclusively based on
those characters it is not unlikely that what has been regarded as two species of
Ditylum are again modifications of one species. This question should, however, be
settled by someone with better taxonomic qualifications. I mention the above facts
to show that even in pure lines there exists a considerable range of variability affecting
a number of characters of systematic importance.

(a) Cell division
The cells of Ditylum grow in a longitudinal direction until they reach a certain
maximum size which is rather uniform within a culture, but which may differ markedly
from subculture to subculture (see p. 27). The division of the nucleus and protoplast
then takes place and the new valves are formed inside the parental shell before the
