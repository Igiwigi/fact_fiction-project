Owing to their finite size, cilia from the left/right side of the node (KV) could
potentially bend differentially (grey dotted lines) when exposed to a direc-
tional cilia-driven flow (arrows). (L, left of the embryo; R, right; A, anterior; P,

abnormal kidney development [3,17]. In kidney cilia, the
mechanosensory signal is proportional to the amount of bend-
ing of the cilium [18]. Can this sensory mechanism be acting in
the node? In earlier work, we argued that it could not [8]. Our
argument then was that the symmetry of flow across the node,
allied to the fact that the flow operates at very low Reynolds
number, implies that at the equivalent places on the left and
the right, the flow magnitude will be exactly the same, and
hence, a mechanosensory mechanism would give the same
signal on left and right and could not function as required.
The former point is correct: the flow magnitudes are indeed
necessarily symmetric between left and right across the node
owing to basic fluid mechanics; however, the latter point is
not correct.

We later realized that we were wrong: that it is in theory
possible for a mechanosensory cilium to detect a difference
between the left and right sides of the node, because such a
