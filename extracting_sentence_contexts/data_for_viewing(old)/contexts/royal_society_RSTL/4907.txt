Series”), but also a very considerable number of compound ethers, and some of their
derivatives.

In order to arrive at this result, we have submitted many silyer-salts to the action
of iodide of allyl, expecting to obtain by double decomposition iodide of silver and a
compound ether, from which it would be possible afterwards to extract the alcohol.
The silver-salts are in general powerfully attacked by iodide of allyl, but comparatively
