Probable observational error = +3 Nb = (difference)? = +3.
No. experiments —1

Coefficient of variation per cent. = +0°01.

In Tables XI. to XVIII, pp. 161 to 169, we give the value of y (calculated) for
each group in Column VII.; the error per cent. (Column VIII.) being the coefficient
of variation obtained as above.

Fig. 7, p. 150, represents the above group of experiments; the most probable point
of intersection obtained by calculation is shown by a large cross.

Attention may be drawn to the fact that no “ smoothed curves” have been used in
the above reduction.
