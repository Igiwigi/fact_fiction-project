nutrition (pp. 321-323).

The general conclusions based upon sections A and B are that increase in egg-
volume or increase in proportion of yolk to cytoplasm induces a telescoping of
development, and that the telescoping is due both to a retardation of the rate of

differentiation of the larval tissues and to an acceleration in the rate of cell-division
in the permanent tissues. The development of the larval chordate structure and of
the permanent ascidian structure are virtually independent of one another. This
is confirmed by the facts recorded in a previous study (BERRILL, 1929) that in the
Molgulidae the development of the larval chordate organization may be completely
suppressed without interfering with the normal development of the permanent
structure.
