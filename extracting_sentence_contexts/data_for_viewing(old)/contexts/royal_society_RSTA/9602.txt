7 to 7-5 amperes, and almost all our measurements have been made with currents
between 6 and 8 amp. With 7-5 amp. and a 3 mm arc the voltage was about
52 to 54.

The photographs (negatives) reproduced in figs. 1 and 2, Plate 1, were taken
by mounting the screen so that it could be dropped, thus exposing a sheet of
“ gaslight ” paper pinned just behind. Fig. 1 shows the bare arc for an exposure
of about 1/20th sec., as estimated from the size and position of the aperture in the
falling screen ; the actual size may be judged by the millimetre squares ruled on
the print, the magnification in the reproduction being about 8 : 1.

It will be seen that most of the “ light’ affecting this paper comes from the arc
itself. That this is chiefly ultra-violet is shown by the fact that when a Jena G.G, 3
filter was introduced the image for 1/20th sec. exposure was too weak for reproduction,
and showed only the carbon tips. This filter has a fairly sharp cut-off about
425 my, transmitting freely above 450 my, and scarcely at all below 400 mu.

Fig. 2 shows the result of a 1-second exposure through the G.G. 3 filter. This
caused over-exposure of the carbons, so that the relative importance of the arc is

exaggerated. To the eye the image of the arc is scarcely visible compared with
those of the carbons. The photographs illustrate the well-known fact that almost
