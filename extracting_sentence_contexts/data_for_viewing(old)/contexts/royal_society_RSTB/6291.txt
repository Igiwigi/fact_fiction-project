This chain is afterwards frequently broken at various places when the strains are
set up which orient the chromosomes in a zigzag arrangement at metaphase.

When a chain contains an odd number of chromosomes, e.g., Nos. 4 and 7, it is
usually regarded as including the extra attached to one end ; but in such figures
as 31 and 32 this cannot be so. Here the break in the ring must have come between
homologous chromosomes. Of course, as has long been recognized (Gates, 1923),
the homology of the chromosomes in a pair cannot be so strict in the catenated
Oenothera as in other genera, and it is probable that the homology of the chromosomes
in some pairs is closer than in others. In these forms, where there is no evidence of
laterally paired ends, it is probable that the homologies of the various pairs are not
very close, i.e., the homologous chromosome ends may be very short, too short for
side-by-side pairing. These conclusions appear to be supported by the fact that
breaks in the chain not infrequently occur between chromosomes which are regarded
as homologues.

There is a period in first metaphase when the connections between chromosomes
are stretched to the utmost. Then the forces applied at the spindle fibre attachment
to the middle of each V-shaped chromosome increase to the point of breaking these
connections. This is the beginning of anaphase, as represented in figs. 41-43,
Plate 23. Fig. 41 is unusual. Seven chromosomes are passing to one pole, 6 to
the other, and two chromosomes left in the median plane of the spindle are being
stretched out by forces apparently pulling in opposite directions. This condition
is evidently similar to that described in another trisomic /ata-like mutation (GATEs
and Tuomas, 1914, fig. 49). Other cases of like character have been interpreted
