near wave-lengths 4029 and 4077 and at 42153, The latter line has been ascribed by
Tnarfx to calcium, and is coincident with a strong solar line. An inspection of the
photograph, however, at once showed me that this line is really a strontium line, smce
it is thickest in the spectrum of that metal; 0 that this single plate was at once sufficient,
in the light of these researches, to establish the presence of strontium in the reversing
layer of the 8nn.

It is seen, then, that a comparison of a photograph of any spectrum with the photo-
graphs of the other spectra in which coincident lines occur, will be sufficient to show to
which spectrum a disputed line belongs. It will be also noticed that the three calcium
lines first mentioned are nearly as thick in the lower (ï¬†trontium) spectrum as in that of
calcium itself, while the difference between the thick lines of strontium and the corre-
sponding lines als visible in the calcium spectrum is very great. All these facts are
easily explained on the supposition that the calcium was very much less impregnated
with strontium than the strontium with calcium. In fact I had such faith in the
efficacy of the method, and in the opinion that coincidences are merely due to impuri-

ties, that I did not even consider it necessary to change the poles, but proceeded at once
to place the strontium salt on that which had just before served for the ignition of the
calcium. This at once accounts for the greater impurity of the former. In nearly pure
strontium the same lines are een, but they are then thinner and shorter.
I may remark that the lines at 4045, 4063, and 4071 are due to an iron impurity;
these are the longest lines of iron in that portion of the spectrum photographed.
1 may conclude this statement by remarking that the above facts have been given as
