Sex of
the index bird was not a significant predictor of transmission
success in either model (sexF: B < 0.38 + 1.14, Fy, < 1.10,
p> 0.19). All transmission events were detected between
day 12 and day 24 PI. Overall, rates of transmission were low, despite the fact
that birds remained in constant contact over the entire exper-
iment. Only 7/91 naive birds (7.69%) showed signs of
pathology, and 9/91 (9.89%, including those with pathology)
were considered infected using our pathogen load cut-off. While no birds in our sentinel groups showed visible pathol-
ogy, 5/18 sentinel birds showed transient low-level pathogen
loads at some point during the study and 1/18 sentinel birds
met our conservative definition of ‘transmission’ for naive
group members.
