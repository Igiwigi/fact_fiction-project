Having made a small rectangular box divided into two equal compartments
by a diaphragm of bladder, I introduced into one of them a disc of hard copper,
and into the other an equal disc of soft copper. These discs being connected
with the cups of the galvanometer, and the chambers filled with water, a con-
siderable galyanic effect was produced, and the needle turned round as it does
when the place of the hard copper was supplied with a disc of zine. I then
poured a little nitrous acid into the chamber containing the hard copper, and
observed that the effect was diminished. By adding a little more acid the
needle turned round several degrees in the opposite direction. This experiment
completely overthrows the assumed principle that the galvanic effect increases
with the conducting power of the fluid interposed between the metallic plates,
since by increasing the conducting power of the fluid the effect was diminished,
and by a proper increase was completely destroyed. It is a curious fact, that
if nitric, sulphuric, or muriatic acid be used instead of the nitrous, the results
will be. quite the reverse.

Having thus, I trust, satisfactorily shown that the electric theory is founded
on false principles, I shall now very shortly examine the truth of the most ge-
nerally received chemical theory of galyanism.

3. Dr. WorLrasrox assumes that positive electricity is set at liberty by the
combination of oxygen with one of the metals. This principle is frequently
true, but in many cases it is totally false. This will be rendered obvious by
the following experiments.
