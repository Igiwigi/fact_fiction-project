seems little prospect that either physostigmine or guanidine will be able to displace
the cobra venom from its combination in the nerve ends, and on the other hand,
when they are injected before the venom, they do not seem to have any prophylactic
value.

Bane and Overton (19) found that the presence of calcium salts reduced the
toxicity of cobra venom to tadpoles immersed in it, and I have therefore tested
whether calcium lactate and chloride possess any antidotal action in mammals; these
salts were injected intravenously after the cobra action was well developed. I could
not find that they had any effect whatever on the progress of the poison.

Animals anesthetised with urethane, paraldehyde or veronal generally survive
under the minimal lethal dose of venom longer than normal animals, and in fact
urethane is the most efficient antidote that I have met. It prolonged the intoxication
very distinctly in many cases, and in some seemed to promise recovery, although the
animals all died in the course of the night, probably from excessive heat loss. This
action of urethane was at first puzzling, but is susceptible of a simple explanation.
For any movement increases the CO, of the blood, and thus increases the activity of
the respiratory centre, which in turn throws a greater burden upon the enfeebled
nerve terminations. Now the nerve ends which are continually receiving impulses
are those which fail first both under curara and under cobra venom. Anything that
diminishes active movement without impairing the respiration is thus beneficial in
cobra venom poisoning. And the inference is clear that in cases of cobra bite, absolute
rest should be imposed, if necessary, by means of a hypnotic or bromide. Alcohol
has long had a reputation in some forms of snake bite, more especially in rattlesnake
