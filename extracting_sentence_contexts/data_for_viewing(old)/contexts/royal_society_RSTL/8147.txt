is not the slightest room for doubt about our European ones: they are all modifications
of the Lepidodendroid type. The distinction drawn by BRONGNIART between the Sigil-
taric which have medullary rays and-the Lepidodendra which have not, T have now shown
to be merely due to difference of age. In its young state the Burntisland Diplozylon
is an ordinary form of Lepidodendron. As it, develops it passes through successive stages
of growth, all of which appear to be more or less permanently represented amongst other
matured Lepidodendra, though within what limits has yet to be ascertained, since, as I
have already suggested, some of the forms described in my last memoir may be parts of the
same plant at different ages, though in several of the examples there described this is
certainly not the case. Long before attaining to the dimensions and stage of growth in

ria, identical in eyory other respect with S. ficoides, but in which the medullary rays are similarly composed of
scalariform cells. Remembering the fact that a Diplozylon from the same locality, which I described under
Corn\'s name of D. cycadeoides, possessed the same features, the question arises, how far may these similarly
constructed plants haye borne the mutual relations of root and stem ?

which it becomes a true Diplozylon, this plant possesses a well-defined cellular pith. Its
central axis is 29& composed of bundles of vexsels, but of vertical piles of true cells. As
