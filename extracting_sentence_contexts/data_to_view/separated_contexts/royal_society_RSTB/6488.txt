I have found them to be constant in all
Mycetophilid larvae, including S. leptogaster. Every group consists of four small
sensory hairs of equal length. They are so minute as to require a high magnification
(oil immersion lens)—a fact that may account for Scumrrz having overlooked them. The labium and hypopharynx are described together in Scumrrz’s paper. The
labium is said to be rudimentary and completely hidden within the head.
