A focus on a dominant herbivore may also ignore the
importance of secondary herbivores that may have much
different impacts on landscapes because of differing foraging
behaviours. Diverse herbivores can alter the impacts on
woody plant encroachment and plant diversity because of
diverse foraging behaviour [34]. Species that have more of a
selective foraging behaviour that focuses on woody plants
can be very important to grassland conservation by altering
woody plant encroachment and diversity even if they are
not dominant [34]. In some cases in the North American
Great Plains, prairie dogs may be keystone species that influ-
ence large herbivore distribution, plant species composition
and biodiversity. In fact, the widespread changes in the distri-
bution and abundance of small herbivores have probably led
to more significant plant community change than have
changes in large herbivores. For example, the elimination of
the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys Iudovicianus) in some
parts of its distribution can contribute to increased woody
cover and shifts in the herbaceous plant community [35â€”
38]. Black-tailed prairie dog populations are now estimated
to be at only 2% of their historic levels and may have histori-
cally had an equivalent landscape-level impact to large
herbivores and fire [39,40]. The effects of other species of
small mammals are not as well studied, but have probably
had major effects on grassland landscapes. In summary, to
