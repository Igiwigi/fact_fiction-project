ITS STRAINS AND REACTIONS 155

Still more recent trials with undiluted juice have confirmed the view that whilst
the green areas in the leaves of infected tobacco plants may contain a small quantity
of X, it is not unusual for them to be entirely free of any virus.

From these experiments it appears that our X% sources, originally derived from three
separate plants of the Majestic potato from the field, are not mixed with any of the
less virulent strains. It is not possible, however, to exclude the presence of X°, for that
being necrotic in its action would presumably occupy the same leaf areas as the X”
strain. The differential reactions obtained between the two strains (p. 144) make it
unlikely that any appreciable quantity of this strain is in fact admixed with the 1
source under observation.

Why the X* strain, originally derived from potatoes in the field, should be free from
admixture with X° or X“ so commonly present, is an interesting problem to which at
the moment there seems no obvious explanation.

The disease is readily communicated by means of sap inoculation, and less so by
means of grafting. In the latter case we may find the following:

(a) Failure of union between scion and stock.
