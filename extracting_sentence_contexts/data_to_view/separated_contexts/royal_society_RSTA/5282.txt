The experiment of filling «a telescope tube with water as suggested by
Boscovicn, and tried by Arry, and more exactly by Horx,* aims at a motion quite
different from that above contemplated. It aims at moving a portion only of the
ether in a partitioned-off region of space. It is easy to show that on FREsNEL's
theory no different aberrational effect can be thus observed than is observed with an
air telescope ; in fact, FrusNeL himself, in his original letter to ARaco (§ 4) contem-
plated this experiment, and predicted its negative result, but it may be instructive to
