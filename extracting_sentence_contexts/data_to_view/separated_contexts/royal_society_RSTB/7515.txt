The carotid rete

The extracranial rete is a tightly packed network of interlacing arterial vessels through
which blood is transmitted from the external carotid arterial system to the circle of â€™
Willis, to the orbit, and to the ethmoidal region of the nose (see figures 10 to 15). The rete is wrapped around the internal maxillary artery as the latter crosses the medial
pterygoid muscle (figure 13). It is closely related to the branches of the trigeminal
nerve, and in fact the maxillary division of this nerve passes directly through it. The rete
is shaped like a pyramid, with a base situated antero-laterally, and three sides, forming
respectively an inferior, a supero-lateral, and a supero-medial surface.* The base is
concave and is closely applied to the muscle cone of the orbit, and the apex lies at the
origin of the rete from the internal maxillary artery. The inferior surface rests upon the
medial pterygoid muscle, the supero-lateral surface is adjacent to the temporalis muscle,
and the supero-medial surface lies immediately beneath the base of the skull.
