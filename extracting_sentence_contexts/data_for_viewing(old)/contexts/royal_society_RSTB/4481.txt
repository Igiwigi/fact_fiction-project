usually to follow the inclination of the slits of the pits ; the shreds produced, elongate
by slipping, along planes inclined to these. The slip-lines on the shreds present all
the characters of the spiral striations described by NAceui and his followers for the
walls of many elongated cells.

When longitudinal shearing stresses, operate on thick-walled cells, e.g., in the
autumn wood of Spruce, or in the fibres of hard woods, separation occurs in the middle
lamella between adjoining cells. The middle lamella offers less resistance to the
shearing stresses than the other layers of the thick wall. This mechanical weakness
of the middle lamella is not manifested in the tension and compression failures since
the stress is mainly taken by the other layers of the wall in these cases.

It would be possible to use, to some extent, the facts described above in support
of the micellar hypothesis of NAcrtt. It has been shown that, in regard to their
mechanical properties, the cell-walls of wood manifest an anisotropy closely parallel
to that shown in regard to such other physical properties as double refraction and
swelling. In terms of the micellar hypothesis, the axes of greatest optical elasticity,

* Andaman Padouk and Swamp Cypress also conform to this type.

+ The different degrees to which plastic yielding by slipping occurs in tension and compression,
respectively, of course holds for both types.
