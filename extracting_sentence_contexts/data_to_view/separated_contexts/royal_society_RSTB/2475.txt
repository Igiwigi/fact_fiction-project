All Artiodactyls, Equidee, Hyracidee, Cetacea, and Sirenia.
Marmots, Viscacha, and a few Sciuridze. It will be seen that the pupils of the Cetaceans are horizontally oval, having thus
the opposite direction to that of the Pinnipedia. This fact is possibly indicative of relationship of the Cetacea with the Ungulata,
proved sufficiently on other grounds, while the Seals agree with what occurs in the
other sub-orders of the Carnivora. I have found that horizontally oval pupils do not act to mydriatics, myotics, or light
with anything like the same rapidity that we find to be the case with vertically oval
or round pupils in all the orders other than the Ungulates. The pupils of the latter,
whether round or oval, are all remarkably insensitive to light, drugs, or accommodation
as compared with most of the other Mammals; nevertheless the pupil of every
Mammal is affected by a solution of atropin, at first becoming slightly contracted and
afterwards dilating to its fullest extent.
