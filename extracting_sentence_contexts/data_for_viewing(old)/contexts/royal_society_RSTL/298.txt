From the preceding analysis, it appears that the ore is. com-
posed as follows:
Carbonic acid, - -..,16,70

Peroxide of copper 60,7
Peroxide of jron - 19.50
Silica - - 2.10
Loss ‚Äù - 9.95

100.00

The silica was obviously accidental, and derived from the
quartz crystals; so that the ore, in fact, consists of carbonic
acid, peroxide of copper, and red oxide of iron. In the differ-
ent analyses, I have found the copper to vary a little, The
least quantity I obtained was 48.6, the greatest 51 grains.
The red oxide of iron and siliceous matter varied also some-
what. The least quantity obtained was 19 grains, the greatest
25 grains, These variations are owing chiefly to the admix-
ture of quartz crystals, and partly to the specks of malachite
and red oxide of iron with which the ore is interspersed.

The carbonic acid is obviously combined with the black
oxide of copper, 80 as to constitute carbonate of copper. Now
carbonate of copper, as I ascertained by a direct analysis, is
