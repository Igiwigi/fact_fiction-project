T. R. ROBINSON ON SPECTRA OF ELECTRIC LIGHT;

and O. As to metals, the lowest number, 12, occurs in No. 85; but the average is far
above this. These facts may be explained in two ways. We may suppose that the action of the
electric discharge on the molecules which transmit it has in itself intermittences which
tend to produce maxima of light recurring at intervals, and which are effective in doing
80 when the forces inherent in these molecules are in accordance with them. If that
accord be perfect, the development of light will be intense; but if imperfect or wanting,
the corresponding light will be feeble or will vanish.
