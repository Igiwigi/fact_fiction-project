As a very large number and: very varied selection of samples is necessary for
generalisations, it will be readily seen that the above tables are insufficient, but they
serve to point out the fact that the fungus of LZ. temulentum (or a closely related
form) has a wider distribution than has heretofore been known.

General Conclusions.

The life cycle of the fungus of Lolium temulentwi is probably unique. From the
absence of spore-formation, and from the facts above described, we must conclude that
this fungus ean live for a considerable time without forming spores, passing
from plant to embryo through succeeding generations. It is, of course, not
inconceivable that such hyphze should go on indefinitely without an intervention of
spore-formation, though the phenomenon is so remarkable that it is impossible to
resist seeking for the spores. Many mycorhizal fungi, as far as is known, form no
spores, and several domesticated flowering plants might also be cited as analogous
