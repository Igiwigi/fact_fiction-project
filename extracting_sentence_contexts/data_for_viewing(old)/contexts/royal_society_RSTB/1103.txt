The fact that the character is not sufficient to define an order of mammals, :
to doubt whether it is sufficient to define the animal group which some writ
named Theriodontia. Sir R. Owxn did not adhere closely to the defi itic
Procolophow was included under it, and in that genus there is no indicatic .
differentiation of the teeth, which are uniform in size, and conical.
As the order was at first constituted, it included animals showing some diy
structure. It is, therefore, convenient to endeavour to fix the type whi

families, and arranged the genera in groups in the following sequence :— ~
Binarialia with Lycosaurus and Tigrisuchus.
Mononarialia with Cynodraco, Cynochampsa, Cynosuchus, Galesaurus, Nytho
Scaloposuurus, Procolophon.
