Flies are capable of changing heading via a pure yaw Assuming that the initial command to bank is generated by
manoeuvre with no adjustment in roll or pitch [24,57], but an internal signal, is the counter-bank also the result of a (slightly
banked turns appear to be the preferred means of changing delayed) feed-forward command or is it triggered by sensory
direction. An analysis of flight trajectories within a wind feedback resulting from the early phases of the manoeuvre,
tunnel found that body saccades account for 80% of all and if so, which modalities are involved? The time course of
changes in heading [58]. Banking by just 30°—which a fly bank, counter-bank and yaw during free flight manoeuvres
can perform in a couple wingbeats—creates a sideways along with data from tethered flight experiments provide
