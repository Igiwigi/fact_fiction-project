fact that an injection of agar-sol will sometimes kill the anaphylactic guinea-pig as
rapidly as does the ready-formed anaphylatoxin. Post-mortem Appearances,

The permanent distension of the lungs, first described by AvER and Lewis (6),
has long been regarded as the most characteristic result of death from anaphylactic
shock in the guinea-pig. It is so, in the sense that it is the expression of the
bronchial spasm which is the cause of anaphylactic death in that species, The
failure of the lungs to collapse, when the chest is opened after death, cannot by
itself, however, be regarded as indicating any connection between the cause of death
and anaphylaxis.
