Conceive, further, that each particle of the liquid has that pressure applied to it
which is required in order to keep its motion sensibly the same as if there were no
friction ; the solid body must of course be urged forwards by a pressure equal and oppo-
8ite to the resultant of all the before-mentioned pressures. The action, amongst the liquid particles, of pressures sufficient to overcome the fric-
tion, will disturb to a certain extent the motions of the liquid particles, and the figures
Q of the surfaces of uniform pressure ; but it will be assumed that those disturbances are
D small enough to be neglected, for the purposes of the present inquiry. The smallness
E of the pressures producing such disturbances, and consequently the 8mallness of those
= disturbances themselves, may be inferred from the fact, that the friction of a current
S of water over a surface of painted iron of a given area is equal to the weight of a layer
&0 of water covering the same area, and of a thickness which is only about 0036 of the
Sh height due to the velocity of the current. = Those conditions having been assumed, let it now be proposed, to find approximately
D the amount of resultant pressure required to overcome the friction between the wave and
S the wave-s8haped 80lid. -2
