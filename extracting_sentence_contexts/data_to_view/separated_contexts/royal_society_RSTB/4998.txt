These epithelial characteristics are fully apparent in the thymus of Lophius, and the
original glandular foundation of the organ is even more clearly indicated than in the
placodal adherent type of thymus common to other species. For it is possible to trace
the epithelioid stellate cells of the reticulum, and the scattered mucous and granular gland
cells of the thymic lobules, through irregular connective-tissue spaces lined by an
epithelium of a transitional character to a duct-like diverticulum of the pharynx, in which
the mucous membrane differs in no respect from that lining the general surface of the
branchial cavity. The condition present in this fish is such, in fact, as would result from the breaking
up of the deeper parts of a follicular mucous gland (such as those characteristic of the
base of the tongue of a mammal) by an excessive invasion of leucocytes amongst the
cells of its lining epithelium, spreading apart the stratified cells to form a supporting
reticulum and scattering the gland cells throughout the resulting adenoid and reticular
mass.
