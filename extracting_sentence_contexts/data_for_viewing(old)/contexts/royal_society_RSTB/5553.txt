use compressed air. This was drawn from taps laid at convenient intervals in acompressed-
air supply pipe which circled the incubator room. The method of aeration used at
first was to bubble a slow stream of air continuously through the whole apparatus.
Later, however, this was abandoned, as it was found that more interesting results were
obtained by passing about 400-500 c.c. of sterile air through the apparatus during
the space of one hour per day. This method of “controlled aeration” is probably
responsible for a number of the interesting results obtained—especially with the
Aspergilli and Penicillia—a fact which is discussed in greater detail in Parts III and IV.

At the end of a metabolism experiment, which is stopped, if possible, before all the
glucose has disappeared, in order to minimize destruction of possible metabolism
products, a quick current of air is passed through the whole metabolism apparatus for
two or three hours. The culture flask F is taken off for examination and analysis,
and the various parts—the sulphuric acid bubbler G, the carbon dioxide absorption
bulbs H, I, J, K, and the aspirator Q—are disconnected and their contents submitted
to analysis. In all cases portions of the mycelium are immediately transferred to
OzapeK-Dox agar and beer-wort agar and incubated at 24° C. to test the purity of
the culture, while another portion is examined microscopically for contaminations.
