It is clear, however, that the mixed light here described as green
has some power of opening the stomata. The following experiments make this
certain, in which control leaves were covered with black cloth or paper, so that the
green light did not reach them :—

25 Trianea, May 26, 1897.—Green light for 80 mins. . stomata open,

Control leaf (covered). . cor Sit,

x May 18, 1897.—Green light for 40 mins, . » ‘Open,

a Control leaf (covered). . - shut.

4 Caltha, May 13, 1897.,—-Green light for 37 mins. . open,
By Covered half of leaf » shut. S The fact that red is more efficacious than green may also be illustrated.

E The experiments just given are almost the only ones in this series in which the
2 action of blue light was tested. I must therefore postpone the discussion of this
part of the spectrum. I will here only say that I cannot believe that the slight
opening power in the “green” light depends on the mixture of blue in it.
