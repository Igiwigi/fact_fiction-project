dentition and many other characters, but have a peculiar broad parietal region and a
palate which though open is of a different type.

Unfortunately this simple classification is not quite satisfactory, as some new types
have been found that cannot easily be placed in these groups, and others that, being of an
intermediate structure, tend to break down the sharp distinctions of the groups. In
fact no classification is likely to be completely satisfactory till our knowledge is greatly
increased, not only as regards the many different carnivorous types that have lived,
but also as regards the details of the anatomy of those already known. When one
considers how many different classifications have in the last hundred years been given
of the living mammals. in which every detail of the structure and development can
be studied, one will not too hastily criticise the paleontologist who can usually study
only fragmentary skulls, teeth and bones.

Our knowledge of the structure of the Cynodonts is fairly satisfactory, only a few
points remaining unknown, but the Bauriamorphs, apart from the skulls, are very
imperfectly known. Of the Therocephalians also our knowledge is still rather incomplete.
We know many skulls, one or two pretty fully, but the posteranial skeleton is imperfectly
known. Of the Gorgonopsians we know much of the skull, but apart from a nearly
