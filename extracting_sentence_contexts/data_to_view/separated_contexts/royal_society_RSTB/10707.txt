The estimation sample is much smaller than in
the preceding subsection because convicts were only present
in 32 of the 91 historical counties. The results for overall life
satisfaction are no longer statistically significant but the
results for marital satisfaction remain robust to this esti-
mation strategy, except for the result for the marital
satisfaction gap at the household level. The fact that only marital satisfaction results are robust actu-
ally gives credence to the idea that the mechanism coupling
male-biased historic sex ratios and modern-day satisfaction
operates through the quality of mating and relationships,
rather than more generally. Table 3. Marital satisfaction is higher in formerly male-biased areas: IV regression results.
