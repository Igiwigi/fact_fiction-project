Complexity and narratives

If experiments and models are not up to the task, where can we
turn? Some ecosystems researchers concluded that complexity,

as manifest in wicked problems, are best investigated and
understood using narratives, including diverse contend-
ing narratives [17,27,28]. The notion of using narratives to
understand EIDs (as differentiated from merely communi-
cating information pre-digested by experts) offers some
possibilities for working through the current global swamp
of contested facts, values and policies [17]. If narratives are such effective tools, why have EID
researchers not used them more often? There are several
reasons for this, having to do with both academic cultures
and the nature and framings of the issues being addressed.
