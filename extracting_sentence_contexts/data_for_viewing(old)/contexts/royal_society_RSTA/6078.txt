and quasi-neutral mutations [3-5] and the fact that partial functionality is better than no
functionality at all [6]. Actually, molecular complexity might be relatively straightforward to
achieve.

Molecular function is highly redundant. The same molecular phenotype can be obtained
from an astronomically large number of different genotypes, as revealed by computational
and empirical studies of complete genome spaces for short sequences [7-9]. Such genotypes
are organized as networks-of-networks [10,11], a non-trivial topology with important dynamic
consequences [11] that also points to the need for an updated metaphor to represent adaptive
landscapes [12]. The abundance of phenotypes is not homogeneous in sequence space [8,13-
16], since most sequences are mapped into a small fraction of very large phenotypes. This
fraction, however, suffices to guarantee a spectrum of different and efficient enough functions
so as to sustain life as we know it. The high dimensionality of genotype spaces and the fact
