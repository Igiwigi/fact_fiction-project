resolution, as they can afford to sacrifice sensitivity in these
more brightly lit waters in order to maintain good temporal
resolution. In addition, the fact that juveniles live at warmer
temperatures than the deep-living adults could have a signifi-
cant effect on their temporal-resolving power, as increases in
