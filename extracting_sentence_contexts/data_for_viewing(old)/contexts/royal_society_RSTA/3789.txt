modes with considerable magnetic dipolar (MD) moment [7-9] were extensively studied in the
nonlinear-optical regime [10], being mainly associated with metamaterials and ‘metamolecules’
supporting optically induced magnetic response. Examples include the second- and third-
harmonic (TH) generation in split-ring resonators [11], fishnet metamaterials [12,13], split-hole
cavities [14] and nanosandwiches [15]. A special contribution of MD modes to the nonlinear
multipolar response of metasurfaces was indicated [15-17].

Observation of MD modes [18] in arrays of dielectric resonators [19] and, in particular, silicon
nanoparticles [20,21] was an important step towards low-loss all-dielectric nanophotonics [22].
Having extremely low absorption in the near-IR spectral region, silicon is even more attractive
in the nonlinear regime [23-25]. Previously, we have shown that MD modes can substantially
improve the nonlinear response of silicon nanodiscs [26,27] and their oligomers [28,29].
Apart from the fact that the MD mode is often the lowest-order mode of a high-index
subwavelength spherical or disc-like nanoparticle, it remains unclear whether there is any further
advantage of using this mode for nonlinear conversion processes when compared with ED or
higher-order modes.

In this paper, we compare the nonlinear effects produced by optically isolated silicon
nanoparticles being pumped at their ED and MD resonances, by employing third-harmonic
generation (THG) spectroscopy technique. As depicted schematically in figure 1a, we observe that
exciting the MD resonance leads to a large THG yield compared with the case of ED resonance
because of the stronger field confinement within the nanodisc for the MD resonance. This is
supported by rigorous numerical calculations of the electric field distributions that show strong
enhancement of the overall local field for the MD mode, and rigorous numerical simulations of
the nonlinear-optical response.
