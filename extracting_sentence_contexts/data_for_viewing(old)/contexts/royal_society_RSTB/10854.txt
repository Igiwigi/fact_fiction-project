Although the previous discussion has focused on how acety- H4Ac is largely carried out by Tip60, as part of the NuA4-

H4 tail also contains multiple modifications that can recruit HR. Because 53BP1 functions to limit end-resection and
specific DSB repair proteins to the chromatin. These include blocks HR [165-169], this implies that Tip60 opposes 53BP1

53BP1 binding, and acetylation of lysines 5, 8, 12 and 16, of 53BP1 to the adjacent H4K20me2 [77,170]. Further, the
