for all a,a’,b and b’. Here p(A\a,b) denotes a probability density function over some hidden- 2 |
variable 4, conditional on the orientations of Alice and Bob’s measuring apparatuses,
represented by the points a and a’ (for Alice), and b and b’ (for Bob), on the unit 3
sphere. In fact, it may only be necessary to violate (4.8) partially [1,2], suggesting that 1B
this might be a fruitful area to explore in order to create viable realistic causal theories ig
of fundamental physics. However, an important objection to any proposed violation of :8
measurement independence is that it can give rise to correlations that seemingly have no basis et
in physical theory, suggesting some implausible fine-tuned conspiracy operating in the universe :
at large.

Consider the example proposed by Bell himself [3], where a measurement orientation is set by
some pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). The output of the PRNG is determined by, and
depends sensitively on, some input variable. For example, the value of the most significant digit
of the output variable may depend on the value of the millionth digit of the input variable. In : =
