One of these equations is
C0.C(u+u)C(u—v)=Cu0% — DD

Taking herein v” indefinitely 8mall, we obtain

CuC"u—(Cu)?__ O02 D'/0\? DP
(607 [3-0 C0'/ Cu

where the left hand side is in fact = log Cv, or this second derived function of the

theta-function Cu is given in terms of the quotient-function —_ hence integrating
twice, and taking the exponential of each side we obtain Cu as an exponential the

Pan, of a squared quotient-

function. This in fact corresponds to Jacopr's equation
