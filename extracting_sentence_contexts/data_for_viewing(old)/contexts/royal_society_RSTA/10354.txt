In a similar way, the number of particles R of the matter C present at any time
can be deduced by substitution of the value of f(t) in equation (5). These equations
are, however, too complicated in form for simple application to experiment, and will
be omitted.

13. Changes in the Active Deposit from Thorium.—If the variation of the activity,
imparted to a body exposed for a short interval in the presence of the thorium
emanation, is due to the fact that there are two successive changes in the deposited
matter A, the first of which is a ‘rayless’ change, the activity I, at any time ¢ after
removal should be proportional to the number Q, of particles of the matter B present
at that time. Now, from equation (4), it has been shown that

The value of Q, passes through a maximum Q, at the time T when
Ag/Ay = eT H-M™
The maximum activity I; is proportional to Q, and
