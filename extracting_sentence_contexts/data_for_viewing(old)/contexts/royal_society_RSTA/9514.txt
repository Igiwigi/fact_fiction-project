* An atom of iron has 11 magnetons, and the gramme-atom of iron (56 gr.) contains 6°8 x 10° atoms,

therefore 1 ¢.c, of iron (whose density is taken as 8) will contain $:8x10° atoms.


CONSTITUTION AND TEMPERATURE ON MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY. 103

Prof. J. W. Nrcuorson during the discussion on “The Structure of the Atom” (issued
with ‘Roy. Soc. Proc.’ for July 20) are interesting :—

“T think that Prof. RurnerrorD has made it clear that the nuclear atom is, as a
matter of fact, the only basis upon which profitable discussion of the constitution of
the atom can really be carried on. The main rival theory, as Prof. Hicks has just
indicated, is the magneton theory. It seems that just recently in the course of a
discussion it has been shown that the magneton theory and the nuclear theory do
probably amount to exactly the same thing.”

Future work will test this. But in the meantime it is clear that the magnetic
forces cannot be neglected. |

While this work has been passing through the press, some further extensions have
been made. In particular, there is one which I should like to refer to here because
