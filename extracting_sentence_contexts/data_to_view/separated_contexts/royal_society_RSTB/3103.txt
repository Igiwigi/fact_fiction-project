It is not, however, only the completion of yolk formation, but also the complete
cessation of all cytoplasmic activity, which coincides with the termination of
nucleolar activity. As we have already seen, the production of the basophile
nucleolar substance shows no relation to the commencement of yolk formation, but
is produced continuously throughout the growth of the egg. This substance must
be the result, therefore, not of yolk formation itself, but of a much more fundamental
vital process of the cytoplasm, a conclusion which is supported by the fact that we
already have, in the “ peripheral spherules” presently to be described, an obvious
by-product of the actual process of yolk formation.*

That the nucleolus deals with the waste products of cytoplasmic activity rather
than with the nutritive material in the caryolymph is also indicated by the ultimate
fate of the discharged material described below. The nucleolus of Antedon would thus appear to be derived from the chromatin,
and to function as the excretory organ of the cell, the waste products of cytoplasmic
activity undergoing their final changes within its substance and being discharged, -
now, presumably, inert and harmless, into the cytoplasm, where they slowly
dissolve away.
