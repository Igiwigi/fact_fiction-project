Blue lines represent veins; red lines represent arteries. Acquisition techniques weighted toward the microvascular signal often have relatively
low CNR and therefore require long acquisition times or high field strength to be successful. VASO, vascular space occupancy. (b) Many studies that use high-CNR
T,*w fMRI rely on the fact that voxels can be separated into low-resolution voxels that sample large veins (pink cube) and high-resolution voxels that are dominated
by microvascular signal (black cube). (Online version in colour.)
