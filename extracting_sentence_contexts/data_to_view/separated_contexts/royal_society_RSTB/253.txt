Of the oral depression described by him as occurring between tbe fourth
‘and fifth ciliated bands (11, p. 590) I could find no trace,
Although Wyvitte THomson asserts that the larva “swims with either extremity
‘| in advance indifferently” (21, p. 522), I find that in almost all cases the ciliated
‘) tuft is directed forwards; indeed, out of hundreds of larvee examined, I never saw
‘one swim in the opposite direction, except when it encountered an obstacle, in which
a - ease it would reverse its motion for a short distance, always, however, resuming before
long its original course. The fact that when at rest the cilia all curve towards
the anterior end is probably connected with this mode of swimming.
& (2.) Internal Anatomy.—We left the larva at the end of the fourth day with a
QS ring-like alimentary canal, and four cavities derived from it, namely (1), an anterior
8 body-cavity, running forward into the preoral lobe, and at its posterior end turning
© slightly to the left to open into (2), the hydrocele, which is at present a simple
%» yesicle; (3 and 4), the right and left body-cavities, which are still connected by
a solid cord of cells passing through the mesenteron; but very soon this cord is
% completely absorbed, so that the mesenteron has no longer the form of a ring, but
& rather that of a disc flattened between the body-cavities. 3 Rather before this stage is reached an important change takes place in the
2 positions of the right and left body-cavities.
