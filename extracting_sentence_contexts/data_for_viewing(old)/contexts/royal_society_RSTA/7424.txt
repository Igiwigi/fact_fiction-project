We then have f
G(s) = n2 V2 + 6317 + 2xa, V+K7, (842-1)
and G,(s) = 7, V—2kf,. (8-42-2)
Condition A now becomes, by (8-41°8),

S= 42, Vint [nt V2+ BPr?+ 2ka, vids {22 vex+t)| —(o, V—2kf,)?r?>0.

(8°42-3)
Before reducing this further it is worth pointing out that S is an increasing function of f/V
and, provided that a, is not too great and negative, is also an increasing function of x. This
may also be deduced directly from (8-41-6). From it we conclude that acceleration damping
(ie. the effect of thé terms in f/V) and jet damping (terms in x) have a stabilizing influence on
the motion of the rocket. This explains the well-known fact frequently observed in trials
that many rockets which become unstable after burnt have a comparatively steady motion
during burning.}

Now write ; S, = 4G3f?— (0, V—2xf,)?, (8-42-4)

t E.g. when the projectile is spun by inclined jets. The neglect of the two terms may not be justifiable
immediately after launch in the case of a constant or a decreasing spin; in view of the marked effect of
acceleration and jet damping in the early stages of flight, this however is not likely to be important.

¢ There are, of course, several other factors which contribute to the decrease in stability after burnt.
Among them are the effects of supersonic velocity and of accelerated motion upon the position of the centre
