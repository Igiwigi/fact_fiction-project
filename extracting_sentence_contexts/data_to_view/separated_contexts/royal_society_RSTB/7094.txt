BIREFRINGENCE OF DEVELOPING WING SCALES IN EPHESTIA SERICARIUM (SCOTT)

At about 72 hr. after pupation under the conditions described, the lateral marginal scale
rudiments on anterior wings of LE. sericarium are seen to be positively birefringent with
respect to the long axis of the rudiment (the slow vibration direction is parallel to the long
axis) when formalin-fixed wings are examined in water. The rudiment is, in fact, bire-
fringent as soon as it can be recognized, that is, at a length of 6 to 74. Figure 4, plate 1,
shows lateral marginal scales, about 74 long, from a pupa not more than 84 hr. old,
photographed in the diagonal position between crossed nicols with a jgth wave-length
mica plate in the addition position.
