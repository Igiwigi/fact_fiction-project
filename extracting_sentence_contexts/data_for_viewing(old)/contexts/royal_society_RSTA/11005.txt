triangles and rectangles. These figures are similar, and similarly oriented, over the
entire area of any one crystal, but they are generally different in shape and orienta-
tion on adjacent crystals. In this respect they resemble the geometrical etched pits
in iron and geometrical air-bubbles in cadmium described in our previous paper cited
above. ‘Their occurrence in cast lead that has been exposed to dilute nitric acid has
been described by Professor Mrers and Mr. A. Dick in the ‘ Journal of the Mineral-
ological Society, April, 1899. Professor Miers measured their crystallographic
angles, but does not connect them definitely with the crystallisation of the solid metal
—and Mr. Dick’s view is that they are promiscuously deposited crystals due to
electrolytic transfer of lead from the upper to the lower surface of the specimen.
Careful microscopic examination shows that in some instances this is the case
in sheet lead. Some of the geometrical figures can be seen to be the outlines of
deposited, or at all events, projecting crystals ; but the remarkable fact remains that
even here these crystals are deposited with their elements in the same orientation
as those of the crystal upon which they are being deposited. In many cases, how-
ever, geometrical markings are found which form the outlines of pits instead of pro-
jections. Sometimes these pits occur on the same grain as the deposited crystals, and
both then have similar outline and orientation.

Fig. 5, Plate 4, is a photograph of such geometrical markings on etched sheet-
lead, seen under oblique light and magnified 100 diameters.

The observations here described form a full demonstration of the marked crystalline
structure of sheet-lead, but the origin of this structure is not immediately apparent.
Sheet-lead is produced by rolling out cast ingots of the metal without the aid of heat.
