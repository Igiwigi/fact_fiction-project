A difficulty arises in connexion with all problems of diffr:

action by sharp edges.
The whole theory of w

ave motion in such problems is based upon the assumption that

the displacements of the medium are everywhere small. But when an edge is sharp
the solution may make the displacements at the edge infinite, so that the above assump-
tion is broken. It is only due to the fact that these infinite displacements are confined to
points very close to the edge that the theory, in its application, is but little affected.
