Mr. CARLISLE on @ Peculiarity, &c, 99

into a number of equal-sized cylinders, which occasionally
anastomose with each other. They are exclusively distributed
on the muscles ; whilst the arteries sent to all the parts of the
body, excepting the limbs, divide in the usual arborescent form;
and, even those arteries of the limbs which are employed upon
substances not muscular, branch off like the common blood-
vessels. I counted twenty-three of these cylinders, parallel to
each other, about the middle of the upper arm; and seventeen
in the inguinal fasciculus.*

This fact appeared at first too Solitary for the foundation of
any physiological reasoning ; but, having since had an oppor-
tunity of prosecuting the inquiry, among animals of similar
habits and character, I have been encouraged to hope that the
result may eventually assist in the elucidation of muscular

* motion. The Bradypus tridactylus, or great American Sloth, has

a similar distribution of the arteries of its limbs to that already
described in the Lemur tardigradus; which will be better under-
stood by the annexed figures. See Plate II. figs. 1 and 2; and
the explanations. The communications of these vessels with
each other are more frequent than in the Lemur tardigradus,
