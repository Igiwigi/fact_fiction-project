At the same time, it is evident that the applicability of harmonic
balance-based methods is limited. For starters, their validity can be rigorously justified only for
quasi-linear systems or for the case of nonlinear potentials with power close to 2 [35]. Harmonic
balance-related methods are nevertheless also used for quartic or even stronger nonlinearities
[36], and do in fact yield reasonably good results, albeit with limited and a priori unknown
accuracy. Partial remedy for the case of periodic solutions can be achieved by accounting for
multiple harmonics in the expansion. Still, the attempts to use slowly varying amplitudes for
multiple harmonics may lead to a system that mathematically is even more complex than the
initial one.
