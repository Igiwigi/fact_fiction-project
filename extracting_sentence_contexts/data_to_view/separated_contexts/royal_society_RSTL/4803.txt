* This explains a circumstance which has always hitherto been a difficulty to me; the united testimony of
the best-informed inhabitants, not only at Chamouni but elsewhere (as at Zermatt and at the Simplon),
to the effect that during winter the lowest end of a glacier, which terminates in a valley, does not greatly pro-
trude, nor force the snow before it. This arises in fact from the comparative smallness of the motion which

the tongue of such a glacier appears to possess, especially in winter. + Travels, p. 141. Geneev
