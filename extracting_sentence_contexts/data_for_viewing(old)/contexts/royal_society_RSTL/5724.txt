which are connected by

| A A+B+C=0,
Q then we have
Y a I=S(A*+B*+C?)= —4;(BC+CA+AB),
5 a=I=z4z(B-O)(C—A)(A—B);
= and for the discriminant we have
5 a0 =zhp(a—PY(a—1)(a—B)(—1)(B=I(7—ÞY
I =345AB*C?,
H and it is easy by means of a preceding formula to verify the equation O =F—27F*
Z 139. The formulz show a very remarkable analogy between the covariants of a cubic
= and the invariants of a quartic. In fact—
= For the cubic. For the quartic.

5 B=(y—ea—Py), B=(y—e)(B—3),
E C=(a—BY(w—7y), C=(u—BN(y—d).
ij And then we have corresponding to each other—
EZ For the cubic. For the quartic.
i The Hessian, The quadrinyariant.
2 The cubicovariant, The cubinvariant,
S The cubic into the square root of the discriminant. The discriminant.
5 140. For the two covariants, we have
