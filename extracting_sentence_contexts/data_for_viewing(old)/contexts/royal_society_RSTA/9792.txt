from A,+A, have possible variations which will bring them within, although the
closeness is not so marked as for the doublet elements. The sequence formule are
well established in Groups I. and III., but there are uncertainties in Group IL. which
yet require clearing up. In this relation also, the table shows slight regular variations
as, e.g., A, and A, err from the general mean in different directions, but in these cases

the values of A,+A, come much closer to it. The values of (A,+A,)/w* are therefore
added to the table. It is clear, however, that when the spectroscopic observations
are good, the relation here established will enable very accurate measures of the
atomic weight to be obtained. In fact, with the possible accuracy attainable in
spectroscopic measurements, it may be hoped to obtain far more reliable values of these
constants than by weighing, except in those cases where they are small. The table,
for example, affords considerable support for BRAuNER’s estimates, except, possibly,
in the Mg group, where the irregularities are due to spectral causes. The case of Zn
dnay be taken as an example here. Its spectral values are very good, it shows with
go = = 65°40 the multiple 543°357 instead of 542°70+°30. If the excess is due to the
‘value of the atomic weight, it should be ‘048 larger, which would be allowable within
“Beavnmn’ 8 estimates to bring it to the adopted value of q, 7.¢., w = 65°448. This is
nore fully considered below. The numbers for Se also seem to show that 79'2 is too
Amall for its atomic weight. 79°40 would make q for A, = 362°16 and for A, = 861°77,
“Gnd the spectral uncertainties would account for the outstanding differences.
