Tuts paper is a study of the binary alloys composed of gold and aluminium. The
fact that metals in many cases form definite chemical compounds with each other, is
becoming increasingly evident as attention is given to the subject. But there are
many pairs of metals whose freezing point-curve affords no indication of chemical
combination, and which probably do not combine with each other under the conditions
of our experiments. It is therefore desirable, in seeking for such compounds, to
select a pair of metals which are known to have a peculiar relation to each other.
