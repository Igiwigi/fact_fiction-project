sulphat of alumina and lime, silica, and potash.. | In my exami-
nation of the compact species there was no appearance of the
sulphat of lime until the last; and in every-experiment, previ-
ously to the fresh appearance. of crystals of alum, that had
been long delayed, silica and sulphat of lime were deposited.

I forbear entering into any further-;details concerning my
former experiments on this-curious fossil; as-I- have reason to
think that it will still require a more-particular and minute ex-
amination, on account of another ingredient which eluded my
notice, and which may possibly. impart to itits peculiar character.
The scarcity of it has been hitherto a great bar to my experi-
ments ; I shall record, however, a few. facts' which. I have
lately observed, in the hope that at-a future time I may be able
to resume my examination of it.

I was induced to pay more attention to the volatile ingre-
dients of this substance.* With this view, I introduced some
of the crystals into a small retort, adapted a receiver unto it,

* Mr, Humynry Davy, whose well known skill and sagacity have probably ren-
dered' the researches of another person superfluous, had, I found, been engaged in the
analysis of a mineral which is thought to be identical with the subject of these obzere
vations. He informed me that he had obseryed a, peculiar smell, and acid properties
in the water distilled from the substance which he examined.
