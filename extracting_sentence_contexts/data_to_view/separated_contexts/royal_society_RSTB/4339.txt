A portion of G.’11 is plotted
for comparison, before its feeble rise has begun at all. The idea of Pre-determination is very useful here. If the crop has been sown and
cultivated in a normal manner, and yet is, on the average, a “late” one, the fact
shows that the cause was most probably a deficient water supply during May, a time
to which less importance in this respect is commonly attributed than to June, since
it is in the latter month that the effects pre-determined by deficient water supply in
May are visible. It is here that we obtain the first indication of a real major seasonal effect. Thus
far we have spoken of the water supply as if an actual deficiency of irrigation water
were involved, as it was in the curve G.’10, G. 11, and MK. ’13.
