The difficulties in the way of understanding how
the ordinary processes of evolution can have first brought about such a preliminary
retardation are, of course, considerable, unless it be that the retardation is itself a
favourable character, by its preventing the undue crowding of the young animal’s
mouth, while, at the same time, the full number of teeth are developed for use by
the adult. In this case it would be comparatively easy to understand the assumption
of a milk dentition by the two steps, each favourable in itself—(1) of a retardation
for packing purposes of the permanent tooth in some large-toothed form, followed, in
a later generation, by (2) the temporary development of a deciduous tooth in one of
its descendants with the teeth so small that the gap in the tooth-row during youth,
inherited from large-toothed ancestors, had become a defect to be remedied in this
most effective manner. Turning now to the actual facts, we find that there is among the Marsupials. a

* It seems better to use this term rather than “ milk-molar,” as the milk-teeth have nothing to do
with the true molars, and that name is, therefore, productive of constant confusion.
