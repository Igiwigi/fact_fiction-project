AND ENVIRONMENT OF SINANTHROPUS PEKINENSIS. 83

when reading therefrom projected measurements such as mandibular length and
bicondylar breadth. In its general features, however, the reconstruction presented
accurately reflects our present knowledge of the morphology of the adult Sinanthropus
mandible.

In the adult as in the juvenile stage, the general aspect of the Sinanthropus jaw
would seem to have been unexpectedly neanthropic, except for the morphology of
the symphysis, and certain regions of the horizontal ramus. In the former, attention
has already been directed to the fact that the symphysis, reconstructed in fig. 14, is
only a representation on an enlarged scale of that characterizing the juvenile jaw, a
circumstance which was unavoidable at the time the reconstructions were drawn, and
which is indicated by interrupted lines on the latter.

The maximum thickness of the horizontal jaw ramus in Sinanthropus occurred on
a level opposite the distal border of M2. This is a feature in which the jaw closely
resembles that of Palwoanthropus (H. heidelbergensis), but differs sharply from more
modern types. In typical neanthropic modern jaws the area of greatest horizontal
thickness is usually represented by a quite circumscribed bulge, which, when all three
molars are functional, usually occurs opposite or mesial to the mid-diameter of M2,
the thickness of the ramus diminishing sharply both in front of and behind this point.
