however applicable in practice.

— If n#m, let r=max(n,m) be the rank of the sheaf. Assume that (x,@) is not Kummer
induced. Then, provided p > 2max(n,m) +1, and p does not divide an explicit positive
integer, we have: G° =SL, if n—m is odd (and GG" if |n — m| =1); G? =SL,, SO, or
Sp, if m — m is even and either r ¢ {7,8,9} or |n — m| 4 6 (see [17, Theorem 8.11.3]). Here
also, more precise criteria for which G° arises exist, as well as a classification of the few
exceptional possibilities when |n — m|=6 and r € {6,7,8}.


Example 3.5. If g is the empty tuple, n > 2 and x is an n-tuple where all components are trivial,
then it follows immediately from the definition that (x, @) is not Kummer-induced. Thus, the last
result recovers, for p large enough in terms of n, the fact that the geometric monodromy group of
Ke, contains SL, if n is odd, and contains either SO, or Sp,, if 1 is even.

In order to apply the results of the previous section, it is of course very useful to have some
information concerning the projective automorphism groups of hypergeometric sheaves. Many
cases are contained in the following result.

Proposition 3.6. (1) Let x1, @; and xX, @2 be any n-tuple (resp. m-tuple, n2-tuple, mz-tuple) with
X, disjoint from @, and x» disjoint from @5, and with m, +n, >1, mz +n2>1. Letae Fp. Then we
have a geometric isomorphism

[xa}*Hyp(x1, 01) = Hyp(X2, 2), (3.1)
