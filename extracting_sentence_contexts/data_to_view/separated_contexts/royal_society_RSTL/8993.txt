= d 3. Effects of Artificial Seqmentation on the Rhythmn.â€”We have next to consider
[= Dr. Eiier's obseryations concerning the effects on the rhythm of Aurelia which result
2 on cutting the animal into segments ; and here, again, I much regret to say that I cannot
E wholly agree with this author. It will be remembered that he says he found evidence
> of a yery remarkable fact, viz. that by first counting the natural rhythm of an unmuti-
= lated Aurelia, and then dividing the animal into two halves, one of these halves into
& two quarters, and one of these quarters into two eighths, the sum of the contractions
= performed by these four segments in a given time was equal to the number which had
| previously been performed in a similar time by the unmutilated animal, And not only
be 80, but the number of contractions which each segment contributed to this sum was a
Y number that stood in direct proportion to the size of the 8egment ; 80 that the half
= contracted half as many times, the quarter a quarter as many times, and the eighth
5 parts one eighth part the number of times that the unmutilated Aurelia had previously
A contracted in a period of equal duration. I am glad to observe that Dr. Enter does

not regard this rule otherwise than as liable to frequent exceptions; for, as already
observed, I cannot say that my experiments haye tended to confirm it.
