i, XII. The Breitenbach Meteorite.

Sus Siderolite of Breitenbach was acquired for the British Museum in the year 1863.
2It was found (in 1861) at Breitenbach in Bohemia, at a spot not very far distant from
= the Saxon frontier, or indeed from Rittersgriin, in Saxony, a place in which a very fine
mass, that bears a close resemblance to the Siderolite of Breitenbach, was almost con-
Stemporaneously found. A little way to the west of the centre of the line joining Rit-
Stersgriin and Breitenbach lies Steinbach, a village in the environs of Johanngeorgenstadt,
&mear Schwartzenberg ; and here in 1751 was also found a mixed meteoric mass in which,
Sas in the two already mentioned, iron, sponge-like in its structure, encloses siliceous mi-
Snerals that do not present a familiar aspect. The three meteorites are, in fact, 80 similar
0 one another and $0 dissimilar to any others in European collections, that there can be
-Slittle doubt they belonged originally to the same meteoric fall.
3 STROMEYER® in the year 1825 examined a siderolite in which he found as much as
S61-88 per cent. of silica. This remarkable result, together with the numbers of his
Sanalysis, he interpreted as indicating the presence of a magnesian trisilicate, probably
Smeaning thereby a sesquisilicate (magnesium epideutosilicate), 'The specimen which he
<analyzed he described as coming from Grimma, in Saxony. This specimen was, in fact,
Sa portion of a mass preserved in the collection of the Duke of Gotha, and doubtless
= believed by STROMEYER to be a portion of a stone which was known to have fallen in
Sthe middle of the sixteenth century in a wood near Naunhof in the neighbourhood of
2 Grimma, CnLapxif, however, held this view to be untenable, grounding his opinion
Zon the completeness of the meteorite preserved at Gotha, both as regards its form and its
