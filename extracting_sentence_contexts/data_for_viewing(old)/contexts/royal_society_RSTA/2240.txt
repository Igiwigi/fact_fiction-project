Indeed, the imaginary parts agree, and since both members are analytic also the real parts agree,
after adjustment of the, possibly time-dependent, additive level in g. We also see that

in such regions. In other words, the time derivative of the velocity potential is a single-valued
function having a direct hydrodynamical interpretation. The fact that ¢ is globally single-valued
can be seen as a way to express Kelvin’s Law (2.9) for conservation of circulations. By contrast,
the imaginary part of f need not be globally single-valued (but the derivative f/0Z always is).

As a further remark, Bernoulli’s equation, stating that the right member of (6.9) is constant in
the case of stationary flow, comes out very nicely: when the flow is stationary, so that ¥ =0, then
f is analytic and real-valued in regions without vorticity, and hence equals a (real) constant there.

In the point vortex case, one may view the usage of f as one way (out of many) to get rid of the
pressure p. Indeed, the pressure shows up only in the real part of f, and one can see its role there
as just a way to make this real part equal to the harmonic conjugate of (minus) the imaginary part,
namely w.
