Clusters were determined by finding the
optimum level of inertia gain (p < 0.05).

obliquidens, which share a short calf dependence (less than 1 groups for the duration of their lives [37,38], they both show allo-
year), the tendency of mother-—calf pairs to live in groups with parental care, and during death events they always had at least
other conspecifics [34-36] and the presence of escorts interven- one escort present with the mother. The largest cluster consisted
ing and carrying the dead. Another group was made by Orcinus of Cephalorhynchus hectori, Delphinapterus leucas, Grampus griseus,
orca and Pontoporia blainvillei, which were clustered together Physeter macrocephalus, Sotalia fluviatilis, Stenella attenuata, S. fron-

owing to the fact that juveniles remain with the maternal talis, S. longirostris, Steno bredanensis and Tursiops truncatus,


Table 1. The cosine squared (cos’) scores for the most important variables used to characterize the first two axes (dimension 1 and dimension 2) of the MCA
with variables close to one are best represented by the two dimensions. Also shown is the percentage (%) contribution of the yes/no assignments for each
category.
