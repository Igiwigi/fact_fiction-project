This view of the case derives great force from the fact, that there is strong reason
to regard a large proportion of the existing Foraminifera as the direct lineal descend-
ants of those of very ancient geological periods ;—a doctrine first adyanced by Professor
EHRENBERG in regard to a considerable number of Cretaceous forms ; since fully con-
firmed and extended as regards the Tertiary fauna by the admirable researches of
Messrs. Rueerr Joxes and PARKER on the Rhizopodal Fauna of the Mediterranean, as
well as by my own comparison of the recent and ſossil types of Orbitolites, Orbiculing,
Alveolina, Operculina, and Calcarina; and shown to be applicable also to the Secondary

fauna, as far back as the upper part of the Triassic system, by the remarkable results of
the investigations of the same gentlemen in regard to a well-preseryed sample of it. Following out, by laborious and extended comparison, the method of inquiry I haye 80
much insisted on, they have found ample evidence that the fact of a wide range of varia-

tion in this group is not confined to the present epoch, but that it is true also of the
Foraminiferons fauna of all the geological periods to which their researches have
extended. * Our own experience of the wide limits within which any specific group of
the Foraminifera multiply their varietal forms, related by :some peculiar conditions of
growth and ornamentation, has led us to concur fully with those who regard nearly
every species of Foraminifera as capable of adapting itself, with endless modifications of
form and structure, to very different habitats—in brackish and in alt water,—in the
several zones of shallow and abyssal seas,—and under every climate, from the Poles to
the Equator. In arranging our synoptical tables of the Mediterranean Rhizopoda, recent
and fossil, and in comparing their numerous specific and varietal forms one with another,
we have not confined ourselves to our collections from this region, but have necessarily
made comparisons of forms from almost every part of the globe, from the Arctic and
the Tropic Seas, from the temperate zones of both hemispheres, and from shallow as
well as deep-sea beds.
