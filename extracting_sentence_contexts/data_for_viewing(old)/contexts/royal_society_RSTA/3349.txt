primarily in the linear setting.

The dearth of literature detailing the role that the pressure function plays in flows with 3
vorticity is not surprising. From a theoretical perspective, chief among the reasons for this deficit :8
are the severe mathematical complications inherent in rotational flows [5,6]. As an illustration of : <

this, we note that while it has been rigorously proven that the profile-recovery problem is well
posed for solitary water waves with general vorticity distributions [7], no such result currently
exists for periodic water waves. Additionally, the paucity of mathematical research analysing the
pressure function in its own right no doubt stems from the fact that, for a perfect (incompressible
and inviscid) and homogeneous fluid, the pressure distribution function serves primarily as
a Lagrange multiplier maintaining the divergence-free constraint on the velocity field of the
flow. Nevertheless, although it plays an apparently indirect mathematical role in prescribing the :
fluid kinematics, it is noteworthy that direct, rigorous mathematical analyses of the pressure =
distribution function itself have recently gleaned rich and detailed qualitative information 3
concerning the fluid motion underlying various irrotational water waves prescribed by the fully
nonlinear, exact governing equations [8-10]. Physically, this is not surprising as the pressure nee)
appears as the diagonal term in the stress tensor and is the driving force in the equation of motion. :

However, converse to these mathematical difficulties, it is well known that flows with vorticity [4
are relevant in a physical context, for instance, being vital in the modelling of wave-current DN
interactions [11-14]. This is particularly pertinent when considering that pressure sensors are :3
