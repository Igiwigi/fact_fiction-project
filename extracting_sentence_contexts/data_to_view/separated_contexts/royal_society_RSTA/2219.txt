Whereas Helmholtz’s aim was to understand real fluids ultimately composed of {=
particles acting at a distance, Maxwell was interested in vortex-like processes in space; both his : a

Maxwell emphasized the role of his model at the outset of the paper: ‘I propose now to examine : =
magnetic phenomena from a mechanical point of view, and to determine what tensions in, or 13
motions of, a medium are capable of producing the mechanical phenomena observed. If, by the : =
same hypothesis, we can connect the phenomena of magnetic attraction with electromagnetic DR
phenomena and with those of induced currents, we shall have found a theory which, if not true, : o
can only be proved to be erroneous by experiments which will greatly enlarge our knowledge of 3
this part of physics’ [12, p. 162]. Maxwell’s usage of ‘hypothesis’ here reflects the fact that he was :3
doing something methodologically new and going beyond his contemporaries’ understanding of [eS

‘model’ [46]. The hypothesis could suggest experiments for testing. Provided the theory correctly
described known observations, its hypothetical basis could not be challenged except by extending
the realm of observation.
