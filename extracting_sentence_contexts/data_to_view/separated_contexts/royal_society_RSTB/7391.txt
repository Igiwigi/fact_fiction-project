Accepting this value and applying it as a correction
to the more numerous estimates based on single sections, it appears that the phyllotaxis
index of a typical Lupinus apex as used by Snow & Snow is about 3-2 to 3-3; in plan the 3:5
system of parastichies intersects at 100 to 105°. A few longitudinal sections of Lupinus apices are presented by Snow & Snow, and others
are given by Pilkington (1929); from them estimates are obtainable of the apical angle of
the cone that best fits the region of primordial initiation. Unfortunately for the present
purpose these apices had usually been mutilated some time before sectioning, a fact that
may possibly account for a rather high variability among the estimates derived from them. The angles measured are respectively 48, 48, 52, 56, 58, 59, 60, 63 and 78°, with a mean of
58°. Hence the equivalent phyllotaxis index of an average apex is about 3-25 — 0-75, or 2-5,
and on the apical surface the phyllotaxis is almost exactly midway between the 2:3 and
3:5 orthogonal systems.
