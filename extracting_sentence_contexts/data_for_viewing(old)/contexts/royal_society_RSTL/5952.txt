Q The male system of the Hirudinei is well known to anatomists. As to its descriptive
anatomy, the author has nothing now to add. He is desirous only to offer a few obser-
Soations with respect to its homology.
- In speaking of the ovaria it should have been stated that they are all of equal size
Zand development. It is however a fact of singular morphological interest to note that
Xin that particular anmlus at which the testicular series converges, or that from which
Shey arise, the ovaria are wanting. Now it is only necessary to suppose that the two
:Segmental organs normal to this particular annulus, instead of obeying the rule applying
to all the others, experience a special growth and expansion, giving rise, not to 0varia,
ut to highly developed and systematically distributed testes, and the morphologist
21s at once furnished with the key by which he may unlock the mysteries of this most
Scomplex and hitherto incomprehensible system of organs. In fact the two series of
Stesticular organs, proceeding from (or converging in a penis at) one median point, repre-
Szent two segmental organs, united at the mid-line and modified into this special system

Zof parts. But all this is accomplished, not by the introduction of a new structure or

years before by Ducts of the female 8ystem of Hirudo officinalis. The male system in Hirudo vaces is
-Leorrectly described by DE QUaTREFAGEs. The true feminine organs he has completely overlooked. The
