Principal Forres was struck with this difficulty respecting the adequacy of the internal
forces to produce the crushing effects ascribed to them, and the consequent mobility of
the component particles inter 8, though, regarding ice as viscous, the difficulty may
naturally be supposed to have appeared less to him than if he had regarded it as a solid
gubstance. He puts the difficulty in the following form *:—<* Were a glacier composed of
a 8olid crystalline cake, fitted or moulded to the mountain bed which it occupies like a
lake tranquilly frozen, it would seem impoxsible to admit snch a flexibility or yielding
of parts as should permit any comparison to a fluid or semifluid body transmitting
pressure horizontally, and whose parts might change their mutual position, 80 that one
part should be pushed out whilst another remained behind.” The difficulty as thus
stated is equivalent to that above mentioned. Principal ForBres meets it as follows :—
* But we know in point of fact that a glacier is a body very differently constituted. It
is clearly proved by the experiments of AGass1z and others, that a glacier is not a mass
of ice, but of ice and water, the latter percolating freely through the crevices of the
former to all depths of the glacier; and as it is a matter of ocular demonstration that
these crevices, though very minute, communicate freely with one another to great
distances, the water with which they are filled communicates force also to great distances,
and exercises a tremendous hydrostatic pressure to move onwards, in the direction in
which gravity urges it, the vast porous crackling mass of seemingly rigid ice in which it
is, as it were, bound up.

* Now the water in the crevices does not constitute the glacier, but only the principal
vehicle of the force which acts on it ; and the slow irresistible energy with which the icy
mass moyes onwards from hour to hour with a continuous march, bespeaks of itself a
