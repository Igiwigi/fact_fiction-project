284 DR OC. A. MAC MUNN ON MYOHAMATIN AND THE HISTOHAMATINS.

third myohzematin bands having partially coalesced, and the second band being as dark
as the third, the band before D being, however, well marked. Hence this change is
not the same as that effected by acids. I have tried the effect of a current, of oxygen
passed over insect muscle placed in a snitable gas chamber placed beneath the micro-
spectroscope ; but, although the gas was passed for ten minutes, and the experiment
several times repeated, the myoha:matin bands persisted. The reason, of course, may be
that the gas did not penetrate the 8ubstance of the muscle, but merely passed over its
surface.* Still the fact remains that exposure to air diminishes the intensity of the
bands, that as I have found repeatedly the bands are less distinct when the insect is
killed in flight, that when thus invisible, or nearly 80, they can be brought back by the
use of STOKEs's fluid or ammonium 8u]phide. Hence, then, myohematin can be oxidised
and reduced in the case of insects ; its fully oxidised state is denoted by the absence
of bands, its reduced state by their presence. The same was found to be the case with
the histohzematins, 80 that one may safely conclude that these pigments are concerned
in the respiration of the tissues in which they occur.

Myohzmatin also occurs in spiders. It is present in the muscle of the cephalo-
thorax of Xpeira diadema, Tegenaria civilis, and other spiders ; in these the muscles
are pale, and, therefore, contain but little myohzmatin, but its bands can generally
be brought into view by treatment with reducing agents (spectrum 16, Chart IIT.).
