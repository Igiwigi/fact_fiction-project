Some could also argue that given that neural probes
are very delicate structures, such a technique should not be considered. However, if one were
to perform chip thinning before the integration step of the soft substrate with the more rigid
electronics, the risk of damage to the neural probe could be attenuated. In fact, a study performed
by Sacher ef al. [66] demonstrated that back grinding could be a suitable chip thinning method for
photonic neural probes with a thickness ranging from 50-92 um. In addition to this, there have
been techniques explored to reduce mechanical damage to the chips caused by back grinding,
such as the one explored by Morcom eft al. [67], known as taiko, where grinding is not performed
on the periphery of the back, non-active side of the wafer, leaving a ring structure that enhances
the structural integrity of the wafer. The second method has been gaining more interest within the literature in recent years.
