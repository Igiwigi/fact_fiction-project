The fact that
these two enlargements were already available provided a very strong motive for using
the iron spectrum as the basis of the new series of observations. It was these considerations, together with the important part played by the iron are
in the development of standard series of wave-lengths, that led us finally to concentrate
our efforts almost exclusively on determining the rotations produced by quartz in the
lines of this spectrum. A larger number of lines, extending also somewhat farther into
the ultra-violet, could have been obtained by using electrodes of nickel-steel instead of
iron ; but in view of the extra difficulty of identifying the nickel lines, and the fact that
their wave-lengths were less certain than those of the iron lines, the idea of using’ this
spectrum was abandoned after a trial, and no attempt was made to work up the photo-
graphs that had been taken with these electrodes. The iron spectrum ceases to be of real value beyond a wave-length of 2327 A.U. In
order to bridge the gap between this point and the ultimate limit of transmission of light
through the calcite polarising-prisms and lenses, a few photographs were taken with
electrodes of copper and of silver-cadmium alloy, The cadmium lines were regarded as
of special interest in view of their employment by Sorer and Sarasin in 1882, but in
the region beyond the international series of standard iron lines the wave-lengths of
the cadmium lines are still so uncertain that no value can be attached to a comparison

of the observed and calculated rotations ; in fact, if any use were to be made of the
readings in this distant region, it would be as a means of predicting wave-lengths rather
than rotatory powers.
