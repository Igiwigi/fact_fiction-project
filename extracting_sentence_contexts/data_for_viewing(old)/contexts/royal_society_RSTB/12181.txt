as a reservoir. Recently, Gabalda-Sagarra et al. [143] have
shown how the GRNs in a range of cells (from bacteria to
humans) present a structure quite suited for RC. Empirically
inspired GRNs are simulated and used as reservoirs to solve
benchmark problems as well as known optimal topologies.
They also show how an evolutionary process could success-
fully train output readouts stacked on top of those GRNs.
These examples with physical bodies and gene cross-
regulation highlight a potential abundance of repertoires
in nature.

They also highlight the importance of embodied compu-
tation [132,144]—the fact that living systems develop their
behaviour within a physical reality whose elements (includ-
ing bodies) can participate in the needed calculations,
become passive processors, expand an agent’s memory, etc.
In robotics, this opens up huge possibilities [145,146]—e.g.
to outsource much of the virtual operations needed to

simulate robot bodies. From an evolutionary perspective,
the powerful and affordable computations that RC offers
through compliant bodies raise a series of questions. For
example, with animal motor control in mind: since RC is a
valid approach to the problem and it seems to provide so
much computational power for free, why is it not more
