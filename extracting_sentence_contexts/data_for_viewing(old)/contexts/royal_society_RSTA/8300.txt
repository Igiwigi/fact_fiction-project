junction. The arc for which p < a looks something like a quadrant of an ellipse, concave
upwards, and with minor axis vertical, but it is flatter than an ellipse towards the end of
the minor axis, where g = 0, and is curved up more sharply towards the end of the
major axis, where ep =a. At this point, the junction, the tangent is vertical, and the
curvature infinite. The ordinates of the curve at the vertex (pe = 0) and the junction
(pe = a)areintheratioz: 2. The other arc starts with a vertical tangent At the junction,
where its curvature also is infinite, is concave downwards, and has a horizontal asymptote,
coinciding with the trace of the axial plane, in which the curve lies, on the undeformed
horizontal bounding plane of the solid. The curvature changes sign in passing through
the infinity at the junction, so that the junction presents the appearance of a point of
inflexion. ‘The infinite curvature does not, as has been supposed, imply anything extreme
in the way of extension or contraction of the radial filaments at the bounding curve of
the pressed area. It appears, in fact, from (2) that all such filaments are contracted
uniformly within the pressed area, the amount of the contraction being }p/(-+ p),
and extended outside this area, the amount of the extension being }pa?/(% + p) ¢?,
The discontinuity of strain implied in this statement is in accord with the indeterminacy
of stress already noted.

4. Variable Pressure over Rectangle.

$4.1. In §2.5 it was found that, if the pressure were uniform over the rectangle,
the derivative o*y /ex dy would be infinite at the corners. Let the point (x, y, z) approach
the corner A for example. ‘The stress-component <y tends to become positively infinite
