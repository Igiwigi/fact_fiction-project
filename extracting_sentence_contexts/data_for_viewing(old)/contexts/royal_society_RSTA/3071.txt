M. Heurs gravitational wave detector sensitivities, the standard
quantum limit of interferometry. To overcome
this limit, various techniques are being proposed,
among them different uses of non-classical light and
alternative interferometer topologies. This article
explains how quantum noise enters and manifests in
an interferometric gravitational wave detector, and
gives an overview of some of the schemes proposed
to overcome this seemingly fundamental limitation,
