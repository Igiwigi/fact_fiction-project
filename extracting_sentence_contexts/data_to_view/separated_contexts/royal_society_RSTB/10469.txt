Conclusion will greatly benefit from using co-designed (and co-produced)
research involving researchers in both health (medical and veter-
inary) and ecology disciplines as well as practitioners in ecology,
conservation, land-use planning, public health and veterinary
sciences in reducing the risk of disease emergence. Human efforts to minimize biodiversity loss could also reduce
disease risk, mostly by reducing contact between humans and
wildlife and limiting introduction of exotic species, even if
these efforts maintain areas of biodiversity of pathogen
hazards. Despite the fact that we do not fully understand bio-
