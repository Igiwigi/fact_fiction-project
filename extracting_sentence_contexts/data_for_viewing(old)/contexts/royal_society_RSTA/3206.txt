theories where matter and antimatter have different properties.
Finally, the equivalence principle, the fact that all interactions of the SM fields with charges
related to the energy-momentum tensor are universal, is a foundational assumption of General
Relativity. It is tested to hold to a high accuracy [24]. But it is easily violated in extensions of
General Relativity with extra fields, so there are no fundamental reasons to consider it as sacred.

3. Tests with individual particles

With the previous remarks in mind, one can move on to develop modifications of the SM that alter
the way matter and antimatter interact with each other. It is highly desirable to do it in ways that
allow one to construct a complete theory. By this I mean theories where the points discussed in

1In fact, it seems that it can be violated in non-local Lorentz invariant theories [23], but I do not know how to make sense of
these theories.


the previous section can be clarified. Furthermore, one should be able to extend the modification 3 |

to the different regimes that operate in Nature: relativistic and including particle interactions.

Without these possibilities, it is not clear what a given modification is really testing. â€œ3
As an example, let us consider the case of the possible new interactions in antimatter particles. :B

We start with the action for a test particle in a gravitational field: is
