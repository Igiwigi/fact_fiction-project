We cannot assume geographical barriers within the area, so that
speciation by physical isolation could take place. Rather the proliferation of forms and
numbers seems to have been a spontaneous reaction to a diversified and favourable
environment. This would seem to be, in fact, a typical case of explosive evolution in
ammonites, such as those to which attention has been called by Schindewolf (1936) and
Swinnerton (1938), and presumably to be explained by ecological and genetic speciation
(cf. Huxley 1942, chapter 6). Concerning comparable explosive radiation among the gastropods of south-east
Europe during the Neogene, Wenz has made some apposite remarks (in Krejci-Graf
& Wenz 1932, pp. 115-117), and I am indebted to Mr R.
