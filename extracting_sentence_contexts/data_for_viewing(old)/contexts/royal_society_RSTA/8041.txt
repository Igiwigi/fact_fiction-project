Such an arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the simplest
orthogonal cell given above is not 4-65 A., but 9-3 A., represented on the equator by
an intense second order (200).

The strongest evidence that the equatorial spacing, 9-8 A. (the reflection (001) ),
must be associated with the lateral extension of the side-chains comes from an X-ray
study of water adsorption and the action of steam. “Quadrant photographs ” (see
above) of porcupine quill, both « and 8, brought first to 0° R.H. by prolonged drying
over phosphorous pentoxide and then to 100% R.H., show that though the bulk of the
water adsorbed by animal hairs leaves the X-ray photograph unchanged, I, some of it
does actually penetrate the crystallites in such a way as to increase the spacing, 9-8 A.,
by a few per cent. The action of steam, however, as already mentioned, is even more
striking. Fig. 23, Plate 8, an X-ray photograph of human hair stretched in steam
