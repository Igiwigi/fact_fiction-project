More importantly, the study highlights
various points relevant for the public health policies of the pandemic. Our results indicate that
an initial low fraction of infections among the risk group can lead to an underestimation of the
potential future stress on the health care system. In fact, we observed such an underestimation
during the summer months of 2020. In this period, the reported cases were mainly among younger
people, leading to a reduced stress on health care systems. Consequently, the public discourse
advocated tolerating higher prevalence levels, i.e. restoring social fabric while coexisting with
virus transmission.
