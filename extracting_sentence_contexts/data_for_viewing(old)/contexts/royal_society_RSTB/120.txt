Comparison of Mortality Statistics with the Composition of the Air of
Dwelling-Houses.

One of us, being the Medical Officer for Dundee, made arrangements for the year
1884 with the various Registrars of Deaths in the town, whereby, in addition to the
information which is usually given on the registration of death, full particulars were

comparison of the death-rates with the composition of the air in various classes
of dwelling-houses.

This, we believe, is the first time such a comparison has been made, and is, in fact,
the first time it has been possible, owing to the lack of necessary data. The following
Table represents the results we have thus obtained. In constructing this Table, there
has been a difficulty as regards the deaths occurring in the Infirmary and Poor-houses.
These deaths, in the case of some diseases, materially affect the results, and, as they
are almost always those of people belonging to one- and two-roomed houses, we have
added a final column to the Table, in which the data for the Infirmary and Poor-

houses are added to those for the one- and two-roomed houses together. The
numbers in this column for those diseases which are not materially affected by
