It would indeed appear that the barium and sodium nitroprusside contained a
body in which the iron and cyanogen are in the same proportion as in ferrocyanogen
(Fe Cy,). But as the silver salt precipitated from them does not contain an excess
of carbon, it can scarcely be supposed that this would not be precipitated. But in
fact there are no data further than the mere ultimate analyses upon which reasoning
can be founded with regard to this dissolved and combined foreign substance in the
partially decomposed nitroprussides. As however all their essential characters and
their crystalline form remain altogether unaltered, we cannot view the foreign sub-
stances as more than accidental. SECTION IV.â€”Action of Caustic Alkalies on the Nitroprussides.
