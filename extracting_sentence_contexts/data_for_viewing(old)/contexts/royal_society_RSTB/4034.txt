reduced. They showed by analysis of the alveolar air and various control experiments
that the onset of each period of breathing is due, not simply to rise of the alveolar
CO, pressure, but to diminished alveolar oxygen pressure in addition; and that the
cessation of each period depends similarly on rise in the alyeolar oxygen pressure.
Henperson has further shown that there are variations in the gas content of the
arterial blood which correspond with this conclusion.* Want of oxygen is thus a
necessary condition to the production of the periodic breathing, which is essentially
due to the fact that the excitation, in so far as produced by the want of oxygen,
occurs very rapidly and ceases very rapidly. The centre thus responds like an engine
provided with a very sensitive governor but no fly-wheel, and thus acts periodically.
The normal stimulus of CO, pez se, on the other hand, acts and ceases much more
gradually, with the consequence that normal breathing is quite regular, like the
working of an engine with a heavy fly-wheel.

The very rapid effect produced by want of oxygen in helping to excite the respiratory
centre must be carefully distinguished from the comparatively slow, gradual, and long-
lasting effect due to an alteration in the alkalinity of the blood. Dovenas and
HALDANE suggested that the rapid effect is due to production of lactic acid in the
cells of the centre itself, and that the equally sudden disappearance of the effect when
the alveolar oxygen pressure rises is due to very rapid oxidation or assimilation of this
