Circuits, then, and their arrangements symbolically embody or represent the architecture of
measuring instruments capable of detecting and measuring quantum events, and also enabling
the probabilistic predictions of future events. Their arrangement and operations in the second
respect is enabled by rules that should ideally be derived from certain sufficiently natural
assumptions, independent, for example, of the correspondence principle, which make quantum
theory depend on classical physics. On the other hand, circuits and their arrangements are
still described classically, a fact related to Bohr’s correspondence principle, a connection that,
however, requires a separate analysis. An important difficult question is the relationships between the architecture of the ‘circuits’,
that is, experimental arrangements used in the experiments, in the standard (infinite-dimensional)
QM, and the architecture of the theory, or the same relationships in QFT. Consider the double-
slit experiment, say, in the interference pattern set-up (both slits are open and no counters
installed allowing one to determine through which slit each particle passes).
