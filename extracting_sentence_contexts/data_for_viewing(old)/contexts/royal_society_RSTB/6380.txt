time needed for the completion of maturation and the process of fertilization itself,
in addition to the first cleavage proper. The comparison of successive intercleavage
intervals is thus valid only from the first cleavage onwards. It is accordingly seen
that there is no significant progressive decrease in the intercleavage interval. The
rate of cleavage and development, being inversely proportional to the egg radius,
must therefore vary with the ratio of the volume to the external surface of the whole
and not with the ratio of volume to combined surfaces of the individual cells.

Since the ratio (volume)/(external surface area) seems to determine developmental
rate, the controlling factor is probably the rate of gaseous exchange between the total
protoplasmic mass and the total external surface of the egg or embryo.

If this be so, then in spite of the fact that the intercleavage intervals remain
virtually constant as the blastomeres decrease in size, there should be an increase in

cleavage rate if the blastomeres are isolated from one another, since their originally
mutual surfaces become part of the external exposed surface of each.

ReveERBERI (1932) has found that fertilized fragments of Ciona eggs divide more
rapidly than the intact eggs. In Ascidiella, however, more exact data have been
