powdered rock-salt) ; and it is therefore reasonable to suppose that other 8ubstances may
exist which, whilst they are very different to the eye, may have the same action on dark
radiant heat. We may also fairly assume that a substance may exert a considerable
selection on the rays which it absorbs and reflectsâ€”that, in fact, there may be, in the
ultra-red region of the spectrum, thermic colours, as in the visible spectrum we have
optical colours; 80 that whilst two snbstances may absorb to the same extent heat-rays
of one refrangibility, they may be quite different in their actions on heat-rays of another
refrangibility. These snppositions are not only resonable but yery probable: let us see
how they account for the facts. Light falls on the black and white surfaces of a radio-
meter, or other similar instrument. That which falls on the white surface is nearly all
reflected back again. Were the surface perfectly white al the force which went into
the bulb would be reflected ont again ; the incident ray would contain in itself a certain
amount of potential work ; but as the emergent beam would come out with no loss of
intensity, no work could haye been done on the reflecting surface. In practice this
does not quite hold good. Pith is not a perfect reflector, some light stops behind,
that which comes from it is not quite equal to that which it receives, and the balance
makes itself evident by causing the pith to move to a slight extent.

171. But in the case of light falling on the lampblacked surface the result is yery
different. Here, practically, the whole of the light is quenched by the lampblack.
Force is poured into the bulb, but none comes out. What, then, becomes of it? 1t is
