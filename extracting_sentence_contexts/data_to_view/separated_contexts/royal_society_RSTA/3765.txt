no account of the nature of the other variety of Becquerel rays. I wish to make
some mention of a possible solution of the question, indicating how far it appears to
fall into line with the known facts. Let us, then, imagine that the absorbable rays consist of a stream of positive ions
moving from the radio-active body. Now we know that the positive ions in gases carry the same charge as the
negative, and that they have an enormously greater mass (J. J. Tomson, â€˜ Phil.
