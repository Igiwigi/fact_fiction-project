10!2 consider the ‘block-like’ structure of genomes: the fact
that different regions (introns, exons, regulatory
regions, etc.) exhibit different dynamics of evolutionary
change. They exploit these differences to devise a
multiple sequence aligner that can make allowance for
the regional heterogeneity of evolutionary process to
permit improved alignments, and can simultaneously
estimate the regional structure of a genomic region in
typical cases where this is unknown. Wang & Rannala
