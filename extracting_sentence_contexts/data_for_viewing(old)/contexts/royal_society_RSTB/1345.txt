In April, 1884, ScutumBERGER (34) presented a note to the Académie des Sciences
in which he urged the view that the empty Orbulina shell and that with Globigerina-
like contents, were dimorphic forms of the same species, comparable to the forms
which had been shown to exist in the species of Nummulites and Miliolids. After
reviewing the evidence he proceeds as follows (p. 1004) :—-* La loge unique de
VOrbulina est Vhomologue de Ja loge initiale des autres Foraminiféres : lorsqu’elle
reste vide, elle est de la forme A; avec la série de loges internes elle est de la
forme B.”

ScHLUMBERGER concludes with the remark that the case of Orbulina is in favour
of the view that the forms A and B are distinct from their origin.

The ascertained facts appear to be as follows :—

varying in size, and the largest shells of the sample are of this character. In
, the interior of the sphere is more or less completely occupied by a spire of
bers closely resembling a free Globigerina shell. This is firmly attached to the
of the investing spherical chamber. In rare instances (e, wood-cut) the Orbulina
ber does not completely enclose the Globigerina chambers, and in that case the
spherical surface of the Orbudina is interrupted by the prominences formed by
