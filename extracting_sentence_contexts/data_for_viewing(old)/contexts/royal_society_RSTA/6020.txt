The fact that all higher order terms of the Taylor expansion, including the ones involving moments
of the random variables, are O() and thus vanish in this limit may be rigorously proved [9]. By
integration by parts, we can pass the derivatives from the test function to the distribution g;(v)
and, under the assumptions that g;(0,t) =0 (no individuals with zero wealth) and g;(v,0) has
moments M, bounded for s = 2 + 5 for some 6 > 0 (see [9,19] for further details), we get
