MR. G. 9. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSAZ. 197

The explanation which T have offered to account for the phenomena of artificial
rhythm is, that an alternate process of exhanstion and restoration of excitability on the
part of the contractile tissnes causes the constant stimulation of minimal intensity
alternately to fall below and to rise above the limits of adequacy. This explanation
has been tested and supported by various experiments, which ib is not necessary again
to detail. Taking, therefore, this explanation of the artificial rhythm as satisfactory,

*it follows that it probably has an important bearing on the facts of natural rhythm.

For if in the production of artificial rhythm the exhaustion of contractile tissues is
found to play 80 essential a part, ib becomes incredible that it should not likewise
play some part in the production of natural rhythm. TI am therefore led to suppose
thab in all ganglio-mnscular tissnes which present rhythmic movement, the rhythm
is not exclusively due to any resistance mechanism on the part of the ganglionic
tissues, but that ib is ab any rate in large measure due to this alternate rise and
fall of excitability on the part of the nuscular tisswes. And I have submitted that
this view is sustained, @ priori, by the fact that rhythmic action is of the most
frequent occurrence in lowly organized tissues where as yet there has been no segrega-
tion of ganglionic structure, and, @ posteriori, by the fact that in Sarsia the same
ganglia supply at the same time a stimulus to the rhythmic action of the lowly
