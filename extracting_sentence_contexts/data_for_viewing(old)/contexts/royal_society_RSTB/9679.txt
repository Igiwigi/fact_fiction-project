quern fragments led Wright [83] to conclude that this type of
grinding implement was discarded or destroyed when a
house was abandoned. In the Holocene record of the Balkans,
the incompleteness of the broken objects was interpreted as
indicating that missing fragments were deposited elsewhere
in a process that might have aimed at linking people with
places [84,85].

It is noteworthy that two shallow bowls (objects 90-1360
and 02-157) at Ohalo II were found lying face-down on the
floors of Brush Huts 3 and 13, respectively. No fragments
from these objects were recovered on those floors or anywhere
at the site [91]. The fact that these shallow bowls are broken and
the possibly deliberate ‘burial’/—face-down—of the objects
onto brush hut floors warrant further analyses. If confirmed,
these patterns may represent the earliest examples in the
region of deliberate breakage and burial of selected objects in
