This, as we shall see, is really a consequence

of the smallness of b, its mean value in practice being about 0-015. For q write

equation (7) in the form

1/s—1 = 4X? — cos Qe+

1 272 2 2
4q+—;= 4q (hi f?—l? +f"),

and substitute for q, #? and f? in the right-hand side, getting

4q=- 45+! sin’ 4. cost x (a* a aly oie (16)

Finally equation (8) gives

» _ 47a" cos’ « ”

The equation for g is obtained by substituting for q, ? and f* in (7), which becomes

4? (1—a?*) (a?—g’) {a?—g? + (1—a’) #*} —a‘(1-g?) = 0; . . . (18)

this is a quadratic for g*, whose solution may be written

g° =sin® $a (1 - a ; ici =i oe ena (1)
where @ is given by
cot 6 = AK’ cot? a—(tan’$a)/40. . . . . . . « (20)

The ambiguity is settled in practice by the fact that g? must be small if equation (14)
is to be taken as a first approximation to the solution. In practice, as we have said,
bissmall. Valuable information as to the nature of the solution is, therefore, obtainable
by considering its limit as b>0.
