However, the Polynesian islands have typically steep-sided
reefs that act as a natural protection against tsunamis. Let us finally remark that, in contrast with
the 2004 tsunami, which caused a devastating flood on the coasts of Sri Lanka, the 1883 tsunami
generated by the volcanoes at Krakatoa was hardly notable in Sri Lanka, although both tsunamis
were triggered in a similar region by comparably strong seismic events. The huge difference in the
effects on the coast of Sri Lanka could be explained by the fact that the earlier event happened in
the month of August as opposed to the 2004 tsunami which occurred in the month of December
when under the northeast monsoon the Equatorial Indian Ocean current propagates along the
equator towards Sri Lanka, thus enhancing the effect; see the discussion in [34,35,37-39]. It is,
therefore, of interest to investigate the effects of tropical currents on the propagation of tsunami
waves in the spirit of [14] taking into account also the influence of the Coriolis effect, see [7,8] for
recent discussions of equatorial current fields. Data accessibility.
