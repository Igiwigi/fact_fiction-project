These bodies were closely contrasted with the pure «-amyl nitrite, with one

nother, and also with the other members of the series of nitrites in which bases

‘@ther than amyl were present. ‘a They show amongst themselves only small variations in their activity upon the
Bilood- “pressure and pulse of animals examined under similar circumstances. z From nine experiments which dealt wholly, or in part, with the contrasted action

Sf these bodies, the following facts have become clear :—

& (1.) That the blood-pressure is reduced to a somewhat greater extent by the pure

‘nitrite than by the other three. This difference in reduction is at most but a slight
mppue, the proportionate increase from pure a-amyl nitrite being only about 3 per
nt, above the next in activity of the three mixed nitrites, and not over 6 per cent.
