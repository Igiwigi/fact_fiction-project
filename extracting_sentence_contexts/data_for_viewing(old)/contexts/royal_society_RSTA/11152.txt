the small diameters.” In consequence, dy/dn, or the stress, is greater in the latter
case. The above argument assumes that the same number of stream-lines cross each

diameter. This will undoubtedly be the case, and M. Boussrves@’s proof will hold, if
the boundary of the section be everywhere convex, for then it is evident that each
stream-line will consist of a single simple oval (fig. 10). But when we deal with
sections like those of the present paper it is by no means so clear that this will be
the case. There may be stream-lines which consist of two separate ovals (see fig. 11),
and it then becomes very much open to question towards which part of the section
the lines will be most crowded. In fact in some eases, as we have seen, this will
occur at intermediate points, F (fig. 11), and in other cases the narrowness of the
neck or the sharpness of the bend will counterbalance the limited number of the
stream-lines through the neck, and the fail-points will be at B, B.

§19. Comparison with Saint-VENANT'S Results. “Efficiency” of the various
Sections.

When we compare the results given by these sections bounded by confocal ellipses
and hyperbolas with those given by DE Saint-VENANT in his edition of the ‘ Lecons
de Naver’ for the “sections en double spatule,” we find very good agreement. Thus
the critical value of the ratio of breadth of neck to length for which the fail-points
split up each into two is given by Sart-VENANT as *3247. For the sections of this
