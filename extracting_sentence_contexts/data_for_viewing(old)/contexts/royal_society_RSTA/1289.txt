One of the assumptions of theorem 3.4, which is standard in the literature [7,11,25,26], is that the
LICQ condition holds for every & ¢ &. This condition ensures that i) the maps § > LMP 2. (&),
for k=1,...,M, are affine and hence continuous, and ii) for any & belonging to the intersection
between two regions 3;’s the corresponding LMP vector is unique, so that the affine maps agree
on the intersections resulting in an overall continuous map.° We now proceed to relax ii), allowing
jump discontinuities in LMPs.

5In particular, active constraints can change without causing a jump discontinuity in the LMPs.


Consider two neighbouring regions, which we denote as Z; and = ;, and let H be the
hyperplance separating =; and Ej. The fact that LICQ holds at =; implies that, if {i1,...,iq} are
the binding constraints at optimality in the OPF for & € = i, then in view of equation (3.4) we have
qSNg, where we recall that Ng is the number of decision variables in the OPF (i.e. the number
of controllable generators). As we move from = x on to the common facet F = 2; H between
regions ©; and = jr which has dimension n; — 1, there could be an additional constraint becoming
active (coming from the neighbouring region £j), and since LICQ holds on F we get q+ 1<ng.
In general, critical regions can intersect in faces of dimensions 1,...,ng — 1, and enforcing LICQ
to hold on all these faces could imply the overly-conservative assumption q + ng — 1<ng.

In what follows, we relax the assumptions of theorem 3.4 by allowing LICQ to be violated on
the union of these lower-dimensional faces
