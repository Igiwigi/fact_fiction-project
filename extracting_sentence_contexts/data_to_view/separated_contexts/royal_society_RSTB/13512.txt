As song learning progresses, the sounds produced diversify and occupy a larger acoustic space, although pro-
duction constraints may limit which sounds can be sung. As learning proceeds, notes converge and become more stereotyped, forming clusters within the acoustic
space. (b) When each individual (denoted by a different colour) sings syllables that fall within narrow regions of acoustic space, and different individuals use
different parts of that acoustic space, there are no distinct population-wide categories. (c) Population-wide categories arise when the syllable clusters of different
individuals coincide in acoustic space.
