This confirms (2-49) (and the companion for g,;(00)) ; it shows furthermore, that the factors
¢; (and c}) are independent of i. Since 7 specifies the initial values we conclude that, when
A, >0, the system has the ergodic property, in the sense that the asymptotic distribution is
independent of the initial distribution. From (2-46) we have
