The description which I have already given of the ice-fall of the Rhone and of the
Strahleck arm of the Lower Grindelwald glacier, applies generally to the fall of the
Glacier du Geant. The terraces, however, are here larger, and the protuberances at the
base of the fall of grander proportions. These latter are best seen from a point near A
upon the Glacier du Geant; they are steepest on that side, in consequence of the
oblique thrust of the western tributaries of the glacier. All that I have said regarding


306 PROFESSOR TYNDALL ON THE VEINED STRUCTURE OF GLACTERS,

the toning down of the ridges to rounded undulations which sweep in curves across the
glacier, applies here also. Referring to the section of the glacier of the Rhone in fig, 4,
it will be seen that the word * dirt‚Äù is written opposite to each hollow. In fact the
dopressions between the protuberances are, to some extent, the collectors of the fine
superficial dirt. This is also the case upon the Glacier du G6ant ; but here I noticed
that the frontal slopes of the protuberances were also covered with a fine brown mud.
Lower down the glacier the swellings disappear, but the dirt retains its position upon
the ice, and afterwards constitutes the dirt bands of the Mer de Glace.

A remarkable change in the form of the bands occurs where the glacier is forced
through the neck of the valley at Trelaporte. They sweep across the Glacier du Geant
in gentle curves with their convexity downwards ; but in passing Trelaporte the arms of
the curves are squeezed more closely together, the vertices are pushed sharply forwards,
8 that on the whole the bands resemble a series of hyperbolas which tend to coincide
with their asymptotes.
