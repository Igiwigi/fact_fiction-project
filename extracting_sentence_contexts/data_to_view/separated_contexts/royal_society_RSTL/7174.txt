Diethacetie acid, Amylacetic or enanthylic acid. Although we have not as yet obtained with certainty acids originating from the replace-

radicals, yet there can be little doubt that the third atom admits of a similar substi-
tution ; and we have, in fact, obtained indications of the formation of acids depending
upon this threefold replacement—an operation which, if carried out with amyl, would
obyiously produce triamyl-acetic acid, possessing the composition of margaric acid :
