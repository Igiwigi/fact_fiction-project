And we see from the equation that the surface contains the line (y=0, y=0) as a double
line, the conic

w=z0, aa*+2hay+by*+ 2gzx + 2fyz=0
as a double curve, also the conic

2=0, aa*+2hay+by* + 21aw+2myw+du*=0

for the scroll $(1, 1?) the order is =[m]+M (firs: memoir, p. 457), and we have here
m=3, M=h—4[mP=1—3=—2; that is, order =6—2, =4.
