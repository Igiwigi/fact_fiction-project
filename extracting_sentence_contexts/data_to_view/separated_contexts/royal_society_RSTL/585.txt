Analytical Experiments and Observations on Lac. By
Charles Hatchett, Esq. F. R. S.

Read April 12, 1804. Taz period is uncertain when the substance called Lac, s0
curious in its origin and 80 useful to many arts, was first intro=
duced into Europe; and, although it probably was known to
the ancients, yet the inaccuracy of their descriptions precludes
this from being stated as a positive fact. The natives of India have long employed it for various pur-
poses, exclusive of those which cause it to be in request with
Europeans; but many of the Indian processes are undoubtedly
as yet unknown to us. One of these, of a very useful nature, was some time since
obligingly communicated to me by CyarLes Wilkins, Esq.
F.R.S. and has been the cause of this inquiry into the nature
and properties of lac.
