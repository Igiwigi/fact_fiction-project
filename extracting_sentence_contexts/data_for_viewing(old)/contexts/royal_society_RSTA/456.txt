One region which is particularly lacking in ocean flux estimates is the Southern Ocean. This is
unfortunate as many of the latest generation of climate models appear to have a strong warm
bias in the Southern Ocean; this can reach more than 5K locally in some models. Rectifying
SST biases in a coupled model is unfortunately non-trivial as the root cause may lie in the
representation of atmospheric processes (e.g. clouds or winds), or ocean processes (e.g. vertical
mixing) and/or a combination of nonlinear ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. Furthermore, the lack
of in situ ocean fluxes leads to uncertainty in the Southern Ocean flux measurements which in turn
makes closing the global heat budget difficult. Many different flux products have been developed
using in situ data, satellite data, numerical models and combinations of these. However, there
are significant differences between these products [29]. Coverage of in situ observations of
fluxes in the Southern Ocean is generally very poor and particularly so in austral winter. In
fact, the first successful air-sea flux mooring measurements of the Southern Ocean were only
carried out in 2010 using the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS) [30]. This gave us the first
estimate of the annual air-sea flux climatology (a small net ocean heat loss of 10 Wm~?) and the
seasonal cycle, including several extreme turbulent heat loss events. That SOFS deployment was
extremely valuable but it only lasted 1 year and sampled a single location in a very large ocean.
Sustained air-sea flux observations at more sites in the Southern Ocean are needed in order to
better estimate the climatological heat fluxes and help to resolve the causes of model biases in
this region.
