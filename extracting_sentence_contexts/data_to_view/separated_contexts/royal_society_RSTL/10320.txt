Summary and Remarks. The above observations show that a respiratory colouring matter is present in
Actima mesembryanthemum, Bunodes crassicornts, and other Actinie. That it mus
be respiratory is shown by the fact that one of its decomposition products is capable
of existing in a state of oxidation and reduction. That it is closely related to hamo-
globin is shown by the results attending my attempts to convert ib into hamochromogen
and hematoporphyrin, as the pigments corresponding to these, obtained from the
above Actiniz, are undistinguishable from those obtained from hazmoglobin. The occurrence of biliverdin in such lowly-organised animals is of great interest ; ib
may probably be looked upon as excretory, and, as I said above, a part of it seems to
be present in the state of a chromogen, as proved by the action of acids upon it.
