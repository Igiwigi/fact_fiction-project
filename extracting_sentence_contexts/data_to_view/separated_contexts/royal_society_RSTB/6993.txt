Thus, although the character
of a sediment in a general way depends on a number of independent variables, it is possible
in this case* to establish a rough linear series of lithological grades which are recognizable
in the field. The grades are determined macroscopically by grain size and approximate
composition, utilizing also weathering characteristics, degree and nature of lamination and
colour. Emphasis is laid on their essentially macroscopic characters, on the fact that several
are arbitrarily selected types and that all are chosen with a view to demonstrating graphically
a certain type of continuous change or sedimentary rhythm. Nevertheless, in view of the
fact that macroscopic characters are largely qualitative, in the case of the shale and mudstone
types very short notes on distinctive features and figures roughly defining grain size are
added from an examination of thin slices under the microscope. Grade 1.
