the Kochen-Specker [24] theorem, confirm that if all variables could have a value simultaneously,
the predictions of QM would be violated. Therefore, something must determine when a variable
has a value.
The textbook answer is ‘when we measure it’. This obviously makes no sense, because
the grammar of Nature certainly does not care whether you or I are ‘measuring’ anything.
Measurement is an interaction like any other. Variables take value at any interaction.
However, (this is the key point) if a system S interacts with a system S’, QM predicts that in,
a later interaction with a further system S", a variable b of the S$ US’ system is not determined
by p’. Rather, it is determined by the joint dynamical evolution of the S U S’ quantum system. In
physicists’ parlance: quantum theory predicts interference effects between the different branches
corresponding to different values of the variable a, as if no actualization had happened.
We have thus to combine the presence of these interference effects (which pushes us to say that
a had no value) with the fact that the variable a does take a value.!

1m Many World interpretations, a takes a value indexically relative to a world; in Bohm-like theories only an (abelian)
subset of variables has value, not all of them; in Quantum Information interpretations, a takes a value only when the
interaction is with the idealistic holder of the information; in Copenhager-like interpretations, when the interaction is with
the ‘classical world’; in Physical Collapse theories, when some not yet directly observed random physical phenomenon
happens. ...


The answer of relational QM is that the variable a of the system S actualized in the interaction
with S’ takes value with respect to S’, but not with respect to S’. This is the core idea underlying the
‘relational’ interpretation of QM.
