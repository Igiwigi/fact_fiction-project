Unless that is the case, the energy of elastic strain of the

the displacement in addition to those of the first order, and the equilibrium between
two contiguous portions will not depend on continuity of displacement and of surface
traction alone : other quantities also would have to be continuous for which there is
no interpretation in the ordinary analysis of elastic reactions: the elastic stress
would in fact not then be expressible in terms of tractions on interfaces. In such a
case the only procedure that seems open, as the science of mechanics is now con-
stituted, would be to transfer the effects of that part of the elastic energy which
involves higher differential coefticients to the class of intrinsic or non-mechanical
deformations. 45.
