The stem and ascending process of the post-temporal are very similar to those of
Akysis, "he inner surface of the stem forms the outer boundary, and the reourved
distal portion of the modified transverse process the inner and anterior walls, of the

this process seams, as it were, to haye been crowded out by the abutment of the
anterior margin of the transyerse process against the posterior and opisthotic plates
of the exovcipital.

The air-bladder differs in no essential feature from that of .dhysis, and, as in the
latter Siluvoid, is completely constricted into two small laterally placed air-sacs,
