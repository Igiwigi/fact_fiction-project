Z T think there can be no doubt that the lateral veins, which may now be fairly con-

Sidered as characteristic of Plagiostomes, are homogeneous with the epigastric or

Snterior abdominal veins of Amphibians and Reptiles. When first suggesting this
omology (21) I was unaware of the support afforded to the determination by the

Facts of embryology. In Amphibia (2, P- 539) there are in the embryo two epigastric
eins which open in front into the sinus venosus, while posteriorly they are connected

Awith the iliac veins, and also receive factors from the allantoic bladder and rectum.
Reference to fig. 1 shows that a very slight shifting of the proximal end of the
brachial vein would make it open separately into the precaval sinus (anterior vena
cava), while a displacement mesiad of not more than one or two millimetres would
canse the lateral vein to open directly into the sinus venosus.

I have elsewhere (21 and 22) advanced the hypothesis that the lateral vein may be
looked upon as derived from the vein of the continuous lateral fin of the ancestral
vertebrate, from which, according to the BaLrour-Twacner theory, the limbs of
vertebrates are evolved. On this hypothesis the discovery of the veins and of their
