He refers to
the mean annual fall at Fort William of 86 inches, and at Loch Nevis of 82 inches,t
whereas at Laggan ib is only 46 inches. But Laggan is as far from the hills in
question as is Forb William, and more recent observations given by Mr. SYMONDS
(f British Rainfall,‚Äù 1876-7) show that the rainfall ab the Bridge of Roy is in fact
62 inches annually, and that that place comes within the line of above 50 and under
75 inches fall. \

Mr. Jamresox's view is, however, supported by the authority of Professor TYNDALL}
who considers that the position and greater height of the mountains south of Glen
Spean caused them to intercept the moisture carried by the Atlantic winds which
would therefore have reached the hills north of that glen in a state of greater dryness
and warmth. But the difference alone between the height of the hills from the wes coast at Mull
to Ben Nevis and of the hills eastward of Ben Nevis, is, on the whole, with the
8ingle exception of this and one adjacent mountain, s0 small, that the effect of greater
condensation could have been only of a very limited local character, apart from the
general decrease which everywhere obtains in proceeding from the west to the east
coast.F That this general condition contributed however to a much larger development
of the ice-sheet on the west coast than on the east is tolerably certain.
