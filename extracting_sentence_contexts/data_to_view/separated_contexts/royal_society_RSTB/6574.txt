In referring to EBERSTALLER’S statement that the sulcus frontalis medius does not
join the precentral, but only begins (usually by a transverse piece) quite a distance
in front of it (see in this series $.9.R., A.954.R., and others) he says :—“‘It is different
in Neanderthal men. In all my casts its connexion with the precentral (mostly
the inferior) seems to exist. On the La Quina left hemisphere it connects in Kerrn’s
Gibraltar cast and in recent men.”

In his interpretation of Dusseldorf Neanderthal man and La Chapelle R. (see
his fig. 1), the connexion of the sulcus frontalis medius with the sulcus praecentralis
inferior is clearly portrayed, as is also the fact that the sulcus frontalis inferior is
rudimentary. Whether this interpretation of the sulci in ‘Neanderthal man is
correct or not, it is very impressive that it so closely accords with the conditions
seen in Q.1905.R., S.6.L., $.4.L., S.5.R., Q.2788.R., and other hemispheres. Kappers goes on to say :—‘‘ Concerning anthropoids I must confess that this
fissure is very often described (recently again by Mrncazzint (1928)) as S. frontalis
inferior.
