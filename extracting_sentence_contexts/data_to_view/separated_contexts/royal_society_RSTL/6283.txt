Upon a mean of ten experiments with this
£ apparatus, the delay at the contact-maker appeared to be no more than 0'-0143, which
& converted into distance, at the greatest transit-rate observed, gives a correction of 17-3
feet per second, and at that of the least of 12:8 feet per second, both additive.

-2 It may be remarked that the small error due to inertia, &c. in this apparatus tends
Z nearly to correct itself, the extremely small time lost at starting of the disc being very
Snearly equalled by its tendency to be carried a little too far by the velocity impressed ; the
S whole inertia also of the disc-barrel, &c. was extremely small in proportion to the moving
Sweight W.

= Another correction requiring to be attended to in these experiments was the time of
E hang-fire in the charge of the mine, that is to say, the time required for the burning of
V 8uch a portion of the whole charge of powder as should be sufficient to rupture the
& rock around, and 80 start off from the focus the wave-impulse perceived in the seismo-
E 8cope—in other words, the time lost between the instant of first ignition of the powder,
S viewed as simultaneous with that of making contact at the firing-battery B, and the

starting of the wave of impulse to be measured. In my former experiments at Killiney Bay, it will be recollected that it was in my
power to determine this experimentally and rigidly, the moderate charges of powder
there employed admitting of this, and that T found it amount for 25 lbs. of powder to
07050513, or to about 2th of a second. Such is, in fact, the time that the full charge
of a 68-pounder takes to burn. But in the present case direct experiment was impossible ;
and the yalue for this correction can only be approximately obtained, by observing the
time that elapsed in some instances between the moment of making contact at B and
the first great visible movement of rock at the face of the heading. This obseryation I
