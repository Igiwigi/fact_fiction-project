It has been pointed out that one precondition for
the origin of societies of insects was a ‘get together’ rule that
should operate after individuals are born. This is a key require-
ment in order to achieve a cohesive group. However, less
importance has been given to the fact that, when such a step
has been achieved, group responses resulting from phase tran-
sitions emerge too [18,180—182]. Here also, interactions among
individuals can trigger system-level responses provided that
critical thresholds are reached [18,181,183]. These transitions provide the group-level dynamics
required to perform different types of tasks.
