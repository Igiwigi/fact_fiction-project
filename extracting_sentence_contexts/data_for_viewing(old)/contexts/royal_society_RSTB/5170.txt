composed of metamorphic rocks ; on the plains to the N. of it are extensive deposits
of limestone, recorded, for example, by TEICHMAN (1922-1, pp. 178, 213) and CoaxEs (1919,
pp. 239, 240). The age of these limestones is unknown. 'TeICHMAN remarks their
association with red and green shales and sandstones, so they may belong to the Minchia
Series ; but they may include eastern extensions of the Jurassic limestones of Western
Tibet.

The comparison between north-western Yunnan and the Himalaya should be made
between parts of that chain where its trend is transverse to the ordinary pre-
Himalayan strikes in Kashmir. No argument against the extension of the Himalayan
line eastward of Assam is valid unless it recognises that the Himalayan movements
had there to adapt themselves to the structure left by the Hercynian movements.
When that fact is allowed for, a striking similarity between the Himalayan and Yunnan
sequences is apparent.

§ E.—The Chinese Continuation of the Himalayan Line.

The possible further extension of the Himalayan line eastward of Chinese Tibet we
do not discuss in detail, as it would involve consideration of the geological structure of
parts of central and south-eastern China ; but we may refer briefly to the three possible
lines of extension. The Great Khingan Mountains, which were regarded by Kroporkin
(1904, pp. 333-4) as the Himalayan continuation, are fundamentally distinct in structure ;
