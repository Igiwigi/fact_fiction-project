200 nm film, shifting towards higher temperatures with increasing film thickness. Moreover, ¢m
reported in this work is rather lower than that previously reported in PBLZST ceramic (approx.
4200), a phenomenon that may have been brought about by a number of factors, such as smaller
grain size, formation of a ‘dead layer’ between film and substrate, internal stresses and substrate
clamping. If the thickness of the film further increases, it could be expected that tetragonal phase
would dominate in the film and ¢m of the film would be close to that of the bulk material.
Notwithstanding this fact, ¢m and the corresponding temperature (Tm) are clearly film thickness-
dependent, as can be seen in figure 4b, suggesting that both values are dictated by Fr and Fy. The
value of Tm shifts to higher temperature with the film thickness due to the increase of tetragonal
phase, as shown in figure 3. The ém values do not vary monotonically with film thickness, which
is suggestive that the ‘dead layer’ does not contribute significantly to PBLZST thin-film dielectric
response. It is also clear that a minimum in em is observed at 400nm, which coincides with
the ‘mostly’ rhombohedral to rhombohedral/tetragonal phase transition, an observation that
corroborates the results reported by Pertsev et al. [17] and Kelman et al. [16].

According to the PBLZST ceramic phase diagram, the application of an electric field of
12.5kVcm™! induces an antiferroelectric—ferroelectric phase transition [13]. We have previously
demonstrated that, in 200nm PBLZST thin film, such an antipolar—polar phase transition is
