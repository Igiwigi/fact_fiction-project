The stele, in fact, is of rectangular outline. In other instances where a triangular system of incisions was used (figures 9, 10), the stele
was of triangular outline; and in yet others where a rectangular system was used, the stele
was of rectangular outline. The shape of the stele, in fact, is directly related to the cross-
sectional outline of the isolated terminal region. Higher up, where there is a return to
the approximately cylindrical shape of the normal shoot, the stele is approximately circular
in transverse section (figures 78, 81, plate 10). Figure 11 shows a transverse section of
a shoot which had been dissected by six radial longitudinal incisions, the apical meristem
being left intact.
