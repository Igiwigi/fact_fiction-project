The millboard test, however, which is
advocated by Unwin, should give a constant value, although it is not the value which
would hold for a cylinder under uniform pressure. (d.) Diagrams 12-14 suggest an explanation of the fact that, when short cylinders
are strongly compressed between very hard surfaces, pieces are sometimes cut out at
the ends of an approximately conical shape. The same occurs when spherical pieces
of metal, such as ball-bearings, are compressed between parallel plates. This is usually
explained by saying that the material breaks along the planes of principal shear.
