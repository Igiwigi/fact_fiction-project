fish, it is unclear whether they use discrete or continuous
quantities (or both) for the association with space.

Clearly, the limited, if any, amount of experience available
to newborn chicks and newborn humans with different numer-
osities before testing strongly supports an innately predisposed
mechanism for the association between space and number.
This would fit in well with a crucial argument that has been
put forward by Gallistel [1,2] concerning the need for a
common currency in the brain to represent different kinds of
magnitudes (discrete as numerosities or continuous as spatial
distances) in order to perform computations like ratio, which
has been proved in fact to be available to both human infants
[54], adult monkeys [55] and newborn chicks [56].

However, despite the behavioural resemblances, and
differently from in the case of geometrical cognition, it is
hard to say whether we are here facing common, homologous
brain mechanisms, or evolutionary convergence, or mere
resemblances reflecting completely different underlying
mechanisms.

Let us start by considering current evidence for the under-
lying mechanisms of approximate number representation. We
know that humans and other vertebrate animals share an evo-
