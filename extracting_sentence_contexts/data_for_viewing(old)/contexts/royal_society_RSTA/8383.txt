Let us change the origin to the point (0, —c). Neglecting additive constants, the
function becomes

This new function demonstrates incidentally a fact that is known already, namely,
the fact that the barrier is a stream line, for if we put Z = & where & is real, we have that

91 (6 — 3) 3 (6 — ft

9,4) 95 (EPH) =e

since the numerator and denominator are conjugate functions, and also

exp[i22(5 — )e ]|=2 so that |J(Z)|=1.

has simple zeros at the positive vortices of the system. Originally the vortices were
