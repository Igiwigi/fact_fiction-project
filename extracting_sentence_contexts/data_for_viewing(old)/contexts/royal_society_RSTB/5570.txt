than with the emergences of Psilophyton. There is one point concerning their arrange-
ment, however, in which the appendages of Thursophyton scem strikingly comparable
to the spines of Psilophyton. It has been found that large and small appendages may
be inserted close together on the shoot of Thursophyton (Lana, 1925, figs. 28-39). As
in the case of Psilophyton princeps this feature became evident in isolated macerated
portions of the incrustation, though it was not noticeable in the specimen on
the rock.

These brief references to early microphyllous plants will suffice to show that there are
indications of a series in complexity and specialisation from the type of Psilophyton,
through that of Thursophyton and Asterorylon, to that found in the Lycopodiales. Our
detailed knowledge of the pertinent facts for these and other early microphyllous forms
is still very inadequate. Sufficient has been said to indicate the interest, for com-
parative purposes, of additional information regarding the appendages of any of these
plants as contributing to the solution of the morphological problem of the origin of the
small Lycopod-type of leaf.

The details regarding the sporangia that are described in this paper do not call for
much discussion. They afford the proof that the structures in question are sporangia,
containing spores of one kind. The wall of the large sporangium is shown to be composed
of two layers, an outer black carbonised layer and an inner, thin, brown, translucent
layer. The black layer may reasonably be supposed to be derived from a strongly
thickened epidermis. The inner layer may, perhaps, best be compared with the per-
sistent inner layer of the sporangial wall of Rhynia and Hornea, which was termed a
