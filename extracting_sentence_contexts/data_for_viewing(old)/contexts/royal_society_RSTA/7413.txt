sensitive to asymmetries of design and functioning, such as are caused by inaccuracies in
manufacture, by uneven gas flow and by distortion of the metal components under the
severe stresses set up during burning. These asymmetries can produce considerable devia-
tions from the mean trajectory and are the primary cause of the characteristic high dispersion
of the rocket as compared with shell fired from guns. Accordingly, it is important to know
how the various asymmetries affect the motion, and which of them are of most importance,
so that care may be taken to ensure that the relevant manufacturing ‘tolerances’ may be
confined within as narrow limits as possible. A great deal of the complexity of the mathe-
matical theory is due to the fact that perfect axial symmetry is not a legitimate assumption.

The mathematical theory applies to both rotated and unrotated rockets. Unrotated
rockets are usually stabilized by fitting fins near the rear end in order to ensure that the lift
moment is stabilizing. If the projectile is rotated it may be possible, as for a shell, to stabilize
the motion without using fins. However, since the length-diameter ratio of a rocket is
usually higher than that of a shell, owing to the necessity of providing space for a combustion
chamber, it is not always possible in practice to impart enough spin to stabilize projectiles
without fins.

The assumptions made at each stage are clearly stated. _ -
