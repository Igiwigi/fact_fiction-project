Although this modification of the usual procedure is formally trivial, practically it effects
a considerable saving of time, particularly in view of the fact that the values of / are usually
1 or 2 figure numbers, and that the difference between ¢, and ¢, can usually be made, from
the first estimate, sufficiently small for the calculation of (3-2) to be made mentally.

Numerical integration

For the calculation of the mean magnetization at a given value of h of an assembly of
ellipsoids orientated at random in the field (see table 6, § 4), the value of the integral in

(2:19) is required, namely

cos ¢ = {""cos¢ sin 0d. (3-3)
