with plates of glass 4 millimetres thick. According to MELLON, 61 per cent. of the rays
of a Locatelli lamp are absorbed by a plate of glass only 26 millimetres thick. Pro-
fessor Macxus surrounded his flame by a glass cylinder, and this, it may be urged, par-
tially sifted the heat of the lamp before it reached the end of the tube. But in s0 doing
the glass cylinder itself must become intensely heated, and to the heat of the cylinder
the glass ends of the tube would be opake. They would absorb it all. Cold air admitted
into such a tube is exactly similar to cold air let into my front chamber, it chills what
is in part the source of heat, and maintains that chill by convection. The heat applied

may, in fact, be thus analysed. 1. We have a portion, almost wholly luminous, which
went through the tube direct to the pile; 2, a portion arrested by the first glass plate;
3, a smaller portion arrested by the second glass plate; 4, we have the heat radiated by
the first glass plate towards the second, and wholly absorbed by the latter; 5, we have
the heat radiated by this latter against the pile. This analysis will probably enable us
to understand how Professor MaGxus obtained an absorption of only 24 per cent. with
the blackened tube, and as much as 14:75 per cent. with the unblackened one. With
the latter, the source, and the plate of glass nearest the source, send a copious flux down
the tube to the plate at the opposite end; the oblique rays are in great part reflected by
the interior surface, and thus reach the plate adjacent to the pile. With the blackened
tube this oblique radiation is entirely cut off, the rays incident on the interior surface
being absorbed. Thus the plate of glass adjacent to the pile must be much more
intensely heated with the unblackened tube than with the blackened one. The differ-
