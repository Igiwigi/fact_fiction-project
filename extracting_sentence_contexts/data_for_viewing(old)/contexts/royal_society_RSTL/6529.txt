their own different from that of their elements. In even a simple mixture like air, T
have shown that its spectrum, with a given metal, cannot certainly be deduced from
those of its parts, and it is probable that this rule may be widely extended.

The bearing of this on electro-spectral analysis is obvious; for if the presence of one
substance can be shown in any instance to disguise or transform the spectrum of another,
or if the state of density, solution, alloyage, &c. have influence, it becomes necessary to
eliminate such effects before we yield implicit confidence to this powerful guide. This
implies a wide range of experiment and of cautious study ; in fact, a complete system of
Spectral research through the whole range of our chemical elements and their compounds,
conducted with strict inductive logic, and with the highest appliances of chemistry and
optics. Whatever shall be s0 effected will be © an eyerlasting gift” to science, because,
taking nothing for granted, it will be a real fact.
