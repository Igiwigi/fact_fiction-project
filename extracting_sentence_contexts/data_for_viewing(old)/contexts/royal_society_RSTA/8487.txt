When this was done, it was found that the errors in the two series were predominantly
parallel, ¢.g., the two series would show three pairs of positive errors, followed by one
pair of negative errors and a further pair of positive errors, with only one pair of errors
of opposite sign. Various explanations might be given of this clearly-established
parallelism. hus, if the systematic errors were greater than the casual errors, both
formule would show a run of predominantly positive or predominantly negative errors.
But in the “ quartz ” series, where the casual errors were much larger than in the “ glass ”
series, this explanation could not be maintained, in view of the fact that the sign of these
concordant errors often showed an abrupt reversal. On further investigation, this
reversal was traced in some instances to the presence of recorded satellites, positive errors
being shown by lines with a satellite of shorter wave-length and conversely. ‘This
discovery affords a possible explanation of the very baflling fact that the differences
between the observed and calculated rotations were often much larger than the probable
error of the rotations, or than any conceivable error of the wave-lengths. ‘Thus, in the
range from 2413-310 to 2373-737, where the systematic error is only — 0-002°/mm.,

* The last line to be identified gave (after correcting an error of calculation) a deviation of 0-086°/mm.
between the observed rotation and that calculated for what was thought to be the nearest line. Further
calculation showed that the difference from the value for a neighbouring line, which was obviously the one
that had been read, was +. ‘The error was therefore not in the reading, but in its interpretation,
