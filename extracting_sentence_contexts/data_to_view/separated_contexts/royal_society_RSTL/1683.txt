When
the action of the sponge was moderate, only the hydrogen
and carbonic oxide were consumed, or at most the olefiant
gas was but partially acted upon. Adding more hydrogen,
80 as to occasion a more rapid diminution, the olefiant gas
also was burned ; but the carburetted hydrogen always es-
caped combustion, unless the hydrogen were in such propor-
tion that the ball or sponge became red hot. From the facts which have been stated, it appears that
when the compound combustible gases mixed with each
other, with hydrogen, and with oxygen, are exposed to the
platinum balls or sponge, the several gases are not acted
upon with equal facility ; but that carbonic oxide is most dis-
posed to unite with oxygen ; then olefiant gas; and lastly,
carburetted hydrogen. By due regulation of the proportion
of hydrogen, it is possible to change the whole of the carbonic
oxide into carbonic acid, without acting on the olefiant gas or
carburetted hydrogen. With respect indeed to olefiant gas,
this exclusion is attended with some difficulty, and it is gene-
rally more or less converted into carbonic acid and water.
