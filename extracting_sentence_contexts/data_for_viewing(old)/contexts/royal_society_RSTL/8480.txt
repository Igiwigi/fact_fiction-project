(+1) +2(f—0+1)Y=0,
that is

26f— 38+ 66?— 30+2=0),
or finally

(28 —0+1)#@—9+2)=0.

We have thus (26+1)*=8, that is 44\+36%+1=0 or 4Þ+3k+1=0, or else

(#+2)*=8, that is 643f+4=0 or F+3k+4=0; viz. the equation in k is
(4P+83k+1)(F+34+4)=0,
these being in fact the values of þ given by the modular equation on putting therein Q=1.

The equation of the order 32 thus contains the factor 4(Q, 1)* at least twice, and it
does not contain either the factor Q—1, or the factor {(Q, 1)* belonging to the quintic
transformation ; it may be conjectured that the factor {(Q, 1)*} presents itself six times,
and that the form is

{(Q, 1)}(Q, 1Y'=
but T am not able to yerify this, and I do not pure the discussion further.

22. The foregoing considerations show the grounds of the difficulty of the purely alge-
braical solution of the problem ; the required results, for instance the modular equation,
are obtained not in the simple form, but accompanied with special factors of high order.
