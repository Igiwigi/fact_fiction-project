the descending node is at the first point of Aries, the inclination to the equator is the
difference of the other two. In this manner the inclination of the moon's orbit to the
equator may vary from about 183?, which value it had in 1829 and 1830, to 28Z?,
which is its value in the present year 1838. Consequently the mean declination of
the moon for different years will be different, and the semimenstrual curye ob-
tained by taking the mean of the year will correspond to different declinations in dif-
ferent years. The mean declination for 1834, obtained by taking the correction to
be proportional to the square, is, for 1834, 17%2 ; for 1835, it is 18*6 ; for 1836 it is
19*7; for 1837 it is 20*2. Hence on this account alone the semimenstrual curye of
1837 and 1834 would differ. For instance, for 8 transit, the difference of effect of
declination 17%2 and 20%2 is 6® or 8®; and hence the semimenstrual curyes will de-
viate from each other by such a quantity. Accordingly this feature appears in the
results of the Bristol observations ; and we have in this fact a very remarkable evi-
dence that the effects of declination are discoverable in the tides of each year,

The Bristol observations for 1834, 1835, 1836, and 1837 being reduced, according
to this view, to a common parallax and declination, give the following results, from
which the agreement of different years may be judged of.

* The mean parallax of the different hours of transit is not the same : the greatest parallax occurring near
the syzygies, in consequence of the moon's variation, as I have already observed. Hence the semimenstrual
curve obtained by taking the mean of each hour of transit, requires a correction for parallax to reduce it to the
general mean.
