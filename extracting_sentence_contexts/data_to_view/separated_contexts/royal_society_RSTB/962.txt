The external phenomena attending menstruation in S. entellus is marked by
discharge which flows from the vagina during about four days each month, ’
Unlike M. rhesus, there is no vivid colouring of the buttocks, stomach, thighs
tail, and the only other external sign of menstruation is a slight swelling of {
vulva, and, sometimes, of the nipples of the mamme. 4
The dark colour of the labia and of the nipples prevents any external sign
flushing being seen, but just within the labia the skin is seen to be flushed during ¢
menstrual period. I have not examined the discharge from the vagina of 'S, entellus further tha
determine the presence of a slimy white matter—probably mucus, of cells resembl
pus cells, of red blood corpuscles, and of débris of cells both epithelial and belongit
to the stroma layer of the uterus and squamous epithelial cells from the vagina. The climate of Calcutta, and the fact that the discharge occupies some time
travelling down the vagina, made it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain material it
condition to repay study. I have, however, several menstruating M. rhesus now
my possession, and hope before long to publish the results of examination of t
menstrual discharge in these animals.
‘As soon as the Monkeys were killed, the uterus, with part of the vagina, the tub
and ovaries were cut out altogether, The uterus was then opened from the exte
os uteri along the left and anterior borders, and the ventral wall was turned back,
The vagina is a wide sac with very thick muscular walls, much folded on the
inner side and lined with a thick layer of squamous epithelium. Projecting into t
vagina at the further end of the sac is a small papilla, in the centre of which is
small hole leading into the cervix of the uterus.
