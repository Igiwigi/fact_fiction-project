Carran WirLson, in a very early stage of my magnetic
experiments, took considerable interest, not only in their
application to the purposes of navigation, but in the funda-
mental laws on which that application was founded ; and in
pursuit of his own particular views he undertook, in his last
voyage, to decide, by actual experiment, some of the points
which were not in the beginning universally admitted ;
amongst which one of the most important, was that relating
to the change of position of the ideal magnetic sphere which
I had imagined for the purpose of magnetical reference, and
for the convenience of reducing the laws of action to their
most simple and general form. According to the results
which I had obtained, it was presumed, but not confidently
asserted, (See page 65, 18t edition © Es8ay on Magnetic
Attractions” ) that this sphere, in different parts of the world,
would take up different positions with regard to the horizon,
following in all cases the changes of position of the dipping
needle, Captain W1LsoN proposed to repeat these experi-
ments at different places, where he might have an oppor-
tunity, on his outward and homeward voyages : viz, at St.


Mr. BarLow on the secondary deflections produced, &c, 277

Helena, Bengal, and in China; and he had the satisfaction
of finding the sphere nearly inverted in his different expe-
riments, the law in all cases strictly following those which
had been predicted from my first series of results. The confirmation however of this fact is now of but se-
condary interest, because it has been demonstrated, and
admitted by all who have taken any part in the enquiry ; I
shall therefore pass over these experiments, and mention
only the curious observations alluded to in the title of this
Paper. The apparatus which Captain WiLsoN employed was
exactly similar to that which I made use of in Woolwich, viz. a large and strong round table with a hole in the centre, and
a 13-inch mortar shell, with a contrivance for raising and
lowering the latter through the centre hole.
