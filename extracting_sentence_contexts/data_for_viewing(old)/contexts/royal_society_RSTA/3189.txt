In this case, it is convenient to define G49 = span{e!2""T e. |neZ, k=0,1,2,3}, Gy =cl(Gao) and
Gi = {X € D°((0,1)) | (X, Jo e2""*e,) =0, neZ, k=0,1,2,3}. Then D°([0,1]) has the direct-sum
decomposition D°([0, 1]) = G4 ® Gi.

In fact, one can easily extend the results above to the case where H'(c)=0 and
the algebraic multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue is n, which, as we recall, must be an
even number. In this case, £L"ey—1 = L"~len_2 = L"en_3 =--- = Leg =0, a1 = (J~!en-1,€0)
0 and M= (Jo 'e, ek))jk=0,...n-1 is invertible. Similarly, we define Gro = span{e!2"7T e, [ne
Z, k=0,1,2,...,n—1}, Gy=cl(Gyo) and G* ={X € D°((0,1]) | (X,J-te2""*e,) =0,neZ, k=
0,1,2,...,n}, and observe that D°([0,1]) = Gn Gh.

4. Floquet analysis of the spectral stability of solitary travelling waves

In this section, we consider an alternative approach for studying the spectral stability of solitary
travelling waves that is analytically equivalent to but numerically different from the eigenvalue
problem (3.4). It is based on the idea that the considered travelling waves on a lattice are
periodic orbits modulo shifts, and solitary travelling waves in particular can thus be identified
