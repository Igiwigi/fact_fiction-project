It was tempting to regard this as the missing bone;
but the line of separation, which should in that case be a line of suture, lies on both
sides immediately above, and in contact with, the edge of the splenial bone of the
lower jaw, and follows its course. It would seem that pressure acting through this
bone has broken the palatal plate across along the line of separation, which is
therefore a fracture and no suture. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that
the lines of separation on the two sides do not correspond with each other as closely
as might be expected were they true sutures,

The absence of a transverse bone is possibly a primitive character, and recalls the
prevalent structure of the Stegocephalian palate. The Parietal (Text-fig. 2, Secs. 401-487, and text-figs. 5 and 6),â€”Looked at
from above the parietal bones form together a St. Andrew's cross raised to an
elongated peak in the middle.
