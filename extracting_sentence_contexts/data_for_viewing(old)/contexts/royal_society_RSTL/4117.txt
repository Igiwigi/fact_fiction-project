or $ix, and even as many as ten successive shocks may be obtained, and which cause
the contraction ; and when the turpentine has been interposed, the shocks are from
four to 8ix. The depth of the insulating stratum was always such that a current from
a pile of fifteen couples of plates could not penetrate it.

I have gilded the muscular conductor, and stretched the galyanoscopic nerve upon
its surface; on passing shocks from the small jar I still had contractions in the gal-
vanoscopic frog. In this case also it is to be obseryed that contraction neyer went
beyond the second or third discharge.

Finally, on interposing very fine plates of mica between the surface of the musecle
and the galyanoscopic nerve, the frog contracted at two or three successive discharges
from the small jar. I will here call attention to a fact 80mewhat remarkable, which has
always occurred in these experiments: on passing the first shock of the jar accom-
panied by the spark, the contraction of the galyanoscopic Å¿rog almost invariably fails.


SHOWER UPON INDUCED CONTRACTIONS. 233

What inferences may be-drawn-from-these experiments to aid our decision as to
whether the induced contraction admit of an explanation on the supposition of an
electric discharge similar to that of the jar, and taking place during the contraction
of the muscle?

Before examining this point, I will relate a few other experiments upon the induced
