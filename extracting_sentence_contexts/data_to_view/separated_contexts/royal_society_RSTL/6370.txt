I received the most prompt and cordial co-ope-
£ ration from the proprietor, Jonun Diver, Esq., and was s0 fortunate as to secure the

s8ervices of Mr. H. KrerixG, the well-known fossil-collector, of the Isle of Wight. The lignite-beds, having suffered less from the weather than the interstratified clays
and and, stand out in relief, like a series of rude mouldings, on the wall of the pit,
especially on its southern side; 80 that it is not difficult to make out, in a rough way,
the snccession of the beds. Nevertheless the clay and sand have been s0 much washed
over the surface of the wall that it is impossible to do more than this; hence it was
decided to make a fresh section—in fact, to cut a series of steps, on a large scale, by
which to descend the face of the artificial cliff from top to bottom, and thereby accom-
plish the. double work of collecting fossils and disclosing the geology of the deposit. *
