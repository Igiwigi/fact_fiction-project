The frontal lobe of these Chinese brains strikes us by the height of its slope. This is
obvious if we compare it with Dutch or Japanese mesocephalics. The Chinese frontal
lobe is somewhat less semicircular, but has some resemblance to a highly curved nose,
an appearance correlated with the fact that the facies orbitalis of the skull is fairly high
and has a more oblique or vaulted shape than in other meso- or sub-brachycephalic
skulls, e.g. the Japanese (and Dutch). As a consequence the thinner lower part, the
rostrum of the frontal lobe, is more evident in the Chinese, a feature already noted by
PaRKER and MILs (1886) and by Dercum (1889, 1892). The average of the Japanese-skull is slightly less mesocephalic than the Chinese.
