However, there is no
systematic and direct ranking between the LGM model results when comparing their respective
LGM cooling and the estimates of their climate sensitivity [4]. One of the main reasons is certainly
that the relative strength of each feedback is different for those contrasted climates. This should


be related to the fact that the total LGM forcing is a mixture of LW (greenhouse gases) and SW
(albedo) forcings that triggers each feedback differently compared with future climate projections
that are mainly driven by LW forcing resulting from increase greenhouse gas concentration in the
atmosphere. Therefore, despite the ranking for individual feedbacks being similar, the ranking
between models is different when considering the sum of all the feedbacks and, thereby, model
climate sensitivities. This has strong impacts on our views on the possibility to use regional
evaluations of LGM surface temperatures to constrain future climate sensitivity.
