They are more elongated than among Lizards,
though Scaphewosaurus* has similar bones, but shorter than in Compsognathus and
some Ornithosaurs, like Dimorphodon. No near parallelism is possible with Dinosaurs,
because the bones of the digits are so greatly elongated in Protorosaurus, for this
condition gives a Lacertilian character to the hind-limb, though the stoutness of the
phalanges and metatarsals is more Dinosaurian. From the shortness of the first and
fifth digits, and especially of the metatarsals of those digits, the foot has a suggestive
aspect of degeneration, which, when the metatarsals came to be carried in an elevated
position, might result in the development of such a foot as is seen in Allosaurus,
though the fact that the fourth metatarsal is the longest seems to offer some difficulty
in the simplification of the Protorosaurian foot. The digital bones are ossified on the
Dinosaurian type. The shoulder-girdle and fore-limb.â€”The shoulder-girdle is less perfectly
preserved than the pelvis.
