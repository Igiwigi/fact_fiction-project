$ 26. TEMPERATUREs of Volatilization of Chloral methyl-alcoholate.

The initial pressure in the still was 2'2 millims. On heating with aniline vapour, the
temperature gradually rose more and more slowly to 40'6* without alteration of
pressure. On raising pressure to 55 millims., the 8ubstance melted completely at once.
The melting pressure lies, therefore, between 2'2 and 5'5 millims. Here, again, no
relation between temperature and pressure is observable.

$27. It was noticed that the vapour-pressure of the methyl alcoholate in the
barometer-tube was lower than that of the hydrate at the same temperatures, in spite
of the fact that methyl alcohol is more volatile than water ; and 1t appeared likely
that the substance would be more stable than the hydrate. This was found to be
the case by the following determinations of vapour-density, It will be noticed that
while the vapour-pressure at 785% is 160 millims., the density was determined at

1314 millims.
