The only reptilian teeth which are really coated with cementum, 80 far as T am aware,
are those which are implanted in more or less complete sockets or in a groove. Thus the
teeth of the Crocodile and of the /ehthyosaurus have cementum upon their basal portions;
but whether the inference that cementum is in all cases associated with implantation
in sockets will be borne out by a more extended series of obseryations, T cannot as yet
with certainty say. In proof of my statement that the thin outer layer upon Ophidian teeth is enamel,
the following facts may be advanced :—

Its refractive index is high, s0 that it resembles enamel and does not resemble
cementum. It is very brittle*, 80 that it is often entirely lost in grinding down a thin
section, and is invariably much cracked when it does remain 7 8i7u (se Plate 48. fig. 1). The application of acids to the sections wholly removes it, whereas cementum is even
less affected by acids than is dentine.
