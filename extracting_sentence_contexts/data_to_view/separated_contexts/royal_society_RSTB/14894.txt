This formulation is reliant on small discrepancies between
visual and auditory stimuli (less than 10 visual degrees), for
large discrepancies subjects might instead rely on a causal
inference model [40,45]. The empirical weights were determined by modelling
responses to the incongruent trials as

r = (1 — wp)(@yxy + Wax) + 0.5tp + €,
