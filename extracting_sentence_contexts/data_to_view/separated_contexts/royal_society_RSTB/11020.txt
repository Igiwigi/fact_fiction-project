This
was clearly indicated by the fact that ¢; tan; Was well above
the actual c,; when c, was at the current atmospheric level of
400 pmol mol” and at the actual greenhouse growth c, of
449 pmol mol! (figures 3 and 4c). In contrast to previous
studies [4], stomatal limitation plays a role in the speed of
induction, declining from ca 0.5 in the first 3 min to about 0.3
at steady state, indicating that about 20% of the lag is due to
stomatal movement (figure 5c). This is also indicated by the
fact that when the leaf is at the ambient c, of 400 ppm through-
out, c, declines to about 200 pmol mol! before recovering to ca
230 pmol mol’ at steady state (figure 5b). Combining the ray
tracing model of Zhu et al. [25] and the modelled kinetics of
Rubisco de-activation and activation on sun-to-shade-to-sun
transitions following Woodrow et al. [3,23,24], losses due to

day at latitude 44°N for a point on the flag leaf, assuming one layer of ran-
domly distributed elements above the leaf [25]. (b) The cumulative gross
assimilation of CO, assuming that A* instantaneously adjusts to the
steady-state value fit to the light response curve (figure 1a), ie. no lag
on a shade to sun transition (solid line); versus accounting for the lag
imposed by Rubisco re-activation (dashed line). (c) As for (6) but showing

photosynthetic efficiency was a key control on ¢; (figure 5c). the slow induction were calculated. Parametrized on the data
Pre-treatment at c,=400pymolmol”' resulted in rapid reported here for wheat flag leaves, the lag in activation of
declines of c; to a minimum that was maintained for Rubisco following shade to sun transitions resulted in a 21%
