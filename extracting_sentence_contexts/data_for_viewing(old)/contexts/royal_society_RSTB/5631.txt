of this type is that of B6vine (1926), who has recently described the immature stages
of Psephenoides gahni, from material collected in the Nandhaur River, Haldwani
Division of Kumaon. He has described the habits of the larva by inference from its
anatomical structure. I made observations on the habits of the Psephenus-like larvee
in a small stream, below Dumpep, in the Khasi Hills. Both the types, viz., with
abdominal gills and with anal gills, were fairly common in this stream.

* Mr. K. G. Brair has read through the account of the Coleoptera, and for this my best thanks are due
to him.

f Beetles showing diverse affinities have been grouped in the family Dryopide and by recent authorities
they are split up into three distinct families. Bévrne (1926) has discussed the probable relationships of
the beetles of this assemblage, but in view of the fact that my collection has not yet been determined, I
refrain from referring to them by their distinctive names. The Psephenus- and Psephenoides-like larve
that I have collected in great numbers from several places in India are found living together in the same
stream. The former are characterized by the presence of free branchial filaments on the ventral side
(Inams, fig. 480), and the latter by the presence of a group of retractile anal gills (figured by Bovine).
According to Bévina, Psephenide and the Dryopide (including Elmidw) are distinguishable only on the
character of the gills,


AND EVOLUTION OF THE TORRENTIAL FAUNA. 203

The larvee (Plate 18, fig. 1) were found in great abundance on the underside of stones in
rapid-flowing water about 6 to 7 inches deep. When the animal was crawling, the
