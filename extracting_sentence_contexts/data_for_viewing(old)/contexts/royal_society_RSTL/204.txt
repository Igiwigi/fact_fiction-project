air.

The whole theory of hygrology, as far as I have been able
to collect the. phaxnomena of that class, appears to me com-
prehended in; the foregoing propositions, founded on facts.
The objects. of | that science are in general the: cause of eva-
poration, and the modifications of the evaporated water. The
common source of the water thus disseminated in the atmo-
sphere, is the surface of the earth ; whence, in spontaneous
evaporation, both in air and i vacuo, as well as in ebullition,
we ee that, water fly off with latent fire. If we collect that
product in a close space, it acts in the same manner as/a new
quantity , of expansive fluid. We [know from experience,
that an expansive fluid is really produced by ebullition, and by
evaporation in an exhausted vessel: there is no reason why
the cause. of evaporation, and its, product, '$hould- change in
any case, only by the -presence of air; and in examining
