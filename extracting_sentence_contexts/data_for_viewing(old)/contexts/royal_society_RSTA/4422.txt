1,...,n, whereas in the non-coherent receiver, the phase information is lost, and the output is
only the magnitude |r(iT;)|. It can be shown that the coherent receiver in combination with the
inner transmitter (4.3) and the AWGN waveform channel (4.1) generates the complex discrete-time
AWGN channel

where w; are complex independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance
of =E[|w;|*] =No/Ts = NoW. The variance of the transmitted symbol x; is o2 =P for alli.

The capacities of these two discrete-time channels are shown in figure 4a, where the shaded
region indicates that the capacity of the non-coherent channel is known by means of upper
and lower bounds (see appendix) but not exactly. Despite the fact that they both communicate
over the same waveform channel, their capacities are quite different. Interestingly, the capacity
of the complex discrete-time AWGN channel is log,(1 + 02/02) bit/symbol, which corresponds
to (1/Ts) log,(1 + 02/02) bit/s. This is exactly the same expression as (4.2), which shows that
this combination of transmitter and receiver is, indeed, optimal for the continuous-time AWGN
channel. This optimality can be understood by means of Nyquistâ€™s sampling theorem, which
states that any complex waveform band-limited to [f,f + W] can be completely described by
its samples taken at rate W. Hence, if the waveform is time-limited to a large time interval T,
then 1 = WT complex numbers are enough to completely describe the waveform. In other words,
there is a one-to-one correspondence between x(t), 0 <t<T=nT, in figure 1b and x1,...,X, in
figure 1c, and analogously for y(t), which means that the continuous- and discrete-time AWGN
channels are equivalent and have the same capacity. For general channels, however, there exists
no such equivalence between continuous- and discrete-time models.
