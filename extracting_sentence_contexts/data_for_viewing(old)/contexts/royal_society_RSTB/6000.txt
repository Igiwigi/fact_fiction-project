Its inner margin remains stationary close against the sides of the front edge of the caudal
furca, and its outer parts swing backwards and forwards about this margin just as a
door swings about its hinges. During the greater part of the suction stroke of the
fourth limb, the fifth limb rotates forwards so that it closes the inter-limb space between
the two limbs from behind, and conversely during the greater part of the backstroke, it
swings backwards and so allows the outflow of water from this inter-limb space.

The relative movements of the limbs of Daphnia are difficult to follow and, as far as
I am aware, have never been fully described. It is possible, however, to observe
accurately certain facts which can be plotted in the form of curves and from this the
type of rhythm of the limb movements can be deduced.

The fifth, fourth and third limb appear to move forwards almost together, that is,
there is a very small phase difference between them. There is a difference, however,
and it is very important. The fifth limb swings forwards and is followed almost
immediately by the forward suction stroke of the fourth and then the third limb.

The phase difference between the third and second limb is greater, but the second
limb does not move much in a backwards and forwards direction. Its movement is
mainly lateral, though the third limb appears to push it forwards at the end of its
forestroke.
