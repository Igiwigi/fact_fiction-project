Injection of neuro-active chemicals to produce a lesion
addresses the problems of the interaction between lesion def-
icit and its recovery by measuring behaviour before there is
time for recovery. The injections are small, usually done
with a microliter syringe, and can be made on one day and
the behavioural effect tested on the next day. The day wait
follows from the fact that the neuro-active chemicals are kill-
ing neurons, and their effect is usually not instantaneous. Waiting until the process is closer to being complete avoids
studying behaviour when there might be transient activity,
such as a hyperactivity preceding neuron death. In addition
to behavioural measurement soon after the lesion, a signifi-
cant advantage of the chemical lesion over the surgical or
electrolytic ones, is that the injection can be precisely directed
by first locating the target area with neuronal recording.
