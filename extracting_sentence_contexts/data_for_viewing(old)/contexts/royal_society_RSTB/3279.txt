tissue found here is really of the nature of phelloderm we think extremely probable
for the following reasons. Although there is no definite cambium outside the
phelloderm, there are often some cells to be found (Plate 15, fig. 8) in the
parenchymatous tissue immediately bordering on the secondary cortex which
have the appearance of having recently divided. Further, the tangential walls
of the outer of the radially arranged elements of the periderm are often much
closer together than those lying more internally, and, further, they are distinctly
thinner.

It would thus appear likely, so far as the imperfect evidence will permit us to
judge, that the secondary tissue is really phelloderm, and that the phellogen was
of a periodic nature and not a persistent tissue. The latter conclusion is supported
by the fact that, in some transverse sections of the phelloderm, definite rings of
growth can be seen, like those found in the bark of some Lepidodendrons. This is
well seen in the periderm of Specimen H.

The elements of the phelloderm are thick-walled prosenchyma, usually somewhat
elongated longitudinally, and prismatic in shape. They are seen in transverse
section on Plate 15, fig. 8 (Specimen C), Plate 15, fig. 9 (Specimen G), in radial on

Plate 16, fig. 6 (Specimen F), and Plate 15, fig. 11 (Specimen E), and in tangential
