grown in full sunlight in 1934 and 1935 were markedly more luxuriant. They show
strong resemblance in foliage characters to the well-known specimen in the Jardin
des Plantes which bE Vries identified with O. Lamarckiana. This specimen is figured
by pE Vries (1914, Plate 19) and also by Davis (1927, Plate 5) and was obtained
somewhere in eastern North America by Micuaux in the eighteenth century. The
luxuriance of Micuaux’s specimen indicates that it was perhaps a garden specimen
from seeds collected by him. The foliage of O. paralamarckiana is very similar to

that of the specimen in question, and in fact agrees with it in leaf shape more closely
than does the Lamarckiana of DE Vries because of the more pointed leaves of O.
paralamarckiana, but the Micuavux specimen has long petioles. There is, however,
a great difference between O. Lamarckiana and O. paralamarckiana in flower-size,
which almost certainly involves more than one factor for petal-length. Investiga-
tions of its trisomic mutations, which are much more frequent than in 0. Lamarckiana,
are being continued. Mr. C. E. Forp determined the chromosome catenation as a
ring of 14, from a normal plant in culture 1.33.
