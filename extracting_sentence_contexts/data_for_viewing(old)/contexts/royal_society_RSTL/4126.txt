The number of observations from which each of the first three results is obtained
is 221; in the fourth case it is 238.

We have here in both years a consistent indication of the greater influence of the
moon on the barometrical pressure at periods of perigee than at those of apogee.

The effect of the solar action on the atmospheric pressure is far more difficult to
be shown by any mode of grouping the observations than is that of the moon, not
only because it is much smaller, but because it is masked in the diurnal barometric
oscillation by the much greater and variable influence of the solar heat in producing
atmospheric variations. That it is eliminated, in common with the other variations
which depend on the sun's horary angle, by the process described in this paper, may
be inferred from the fact that no significant difference appears in comparing the
excess in the values of b6â€”b at the lunar hours of 0 and 12, at the periods of syzygies

'and quadratures, during the twelve months from October 1843 to September 1844
inclusive. The mean values in this comparison have been taken from the observations
at 0 and 12, 6 and 18 for 36 hours preceding, and 36 hours following, the epoch of
each syzygy and quadrature. The mean excess at 0 and 12 at the periods of syzygy
is *00337, and at thoze of quadrature 00345.

The quantities treated of in this communication will justly appear to many persons
as extremely small ; but the consistency of the partial results, when the observations
are broken into periods of six months, places beyond doubt the power of observyation,
in appropriate circumstances and continued for a suflicient time, to determine both
