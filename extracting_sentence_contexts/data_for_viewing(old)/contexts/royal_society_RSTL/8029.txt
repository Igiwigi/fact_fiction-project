to take the sagging- as well as the hogging-strains into account in calculating the strength
required in her structure.


452 MR. E. J. REED ON THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF

The third typical ship, the © Bellerophon,” next claims attention ; and I shall suppoge
her to occupy the two extreme positions of support amongst waves of the same dimen-
Sions as those taken in the *© Victoria and Albert,” 300 feet long and 20 feet high. The
reults of the calculations are graphically recorded in Plate XX. fig. 25 and Plate XX1,
figs. 26 & 27. It has been previously shown that the still-water strains of the © Bellero-
phon' bear much resemblance to those of the * Victoria and Albert,” and the same thing
is true of their strains on the wave-crests and in the wave-hollows. The fact that the
excess of weight amidships in still water is proportionately less in the © Bellerophon' than
it is in the © Victoria and Albert” prepares us, however, for the result which calculation |
develops, viz. that the hogging-moment of the © Bellerophon* on the wave-crest bears a |
larger proportion to the sagging-moment in the wave-hollow than the corresponding hog-
ging-moment of the © Victoria and Albert' bears to the corresponding sagging-moment,
On the wave-crest the excess of buoyancy amidships in the © Bellerophon' amounts to 1000
tons (a striking change from the 250 tons defect existing in still water), while the excesses
of weight at the bow and stern amount to 445 and 555 tons respectively ; the resulting
strains,—maximum shearing-force 959 tons, maximum hogging-moment 43,600 foot-tons.
The latter is about 32 times the maximum hogging-moment for still water; and it is expe-
rienced by a section very near the middle of the length, although the section of maxi-
mum still-water strain is considerably abaft the midship section. In the wave-hollow
