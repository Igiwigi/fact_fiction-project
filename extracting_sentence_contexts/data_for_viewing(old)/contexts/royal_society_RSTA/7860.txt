Choosing any two points of © as foci, we draw the ellipse with eccentricity <'. Then the set
covered by all these ellipses is the ellipse which is confocal to & and has eccentricity <<".

One could ask this question. In what cases is it possible to invert the operation
which leads from % to (2)y,? This means : let be a convex set and N, = 1.

By Theorem 9, all admissible numbers N, form an interval with origin 1. Tf is
an ellipse with eccentricity ¢, there is always an wm’ provided that N, =1/e. For
sufficiently large N,, perhaps even for all Ny > I/e, there is no 9%’. In the case of a
circle every N, is admissible. Later on (Theorem 22) we shall see that in fact the

circle is the only set for which (55) has solutions for every No.

§ 4—GromETRIGAL INTERPRETATION OF Nu (7)

In this paragraph we shall prove that the value of Ny,(_») has a simple geometrical
meaning. This interpretation will give us much new information about the
