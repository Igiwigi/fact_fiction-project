the dimensions of the chromosomes. The considerable size of the nuclei so
characteristic of many parasitic plants is often entirely unrelated to the occurrence
of specially large chromosomes, nor does it involve a broad equatorial chromosome
figure (z.e., one containing many chromosomes) at metaphase. What may perhaps be
designated as the trophie condition of the nucleus does not, then, necessarily afford
a reliable indication of the amount of chromatin actually present within it, though
it may well be determined by the accumulation of other substances related to, or
derived from, the chromosomes.

On the other hand, we cannot disregard the effects which external conditions
may sometimes exert on the chromosomes themselves. R. Herrwic, when experi-
menting on the reaction of developing embryos of Strongylocentrotus lividus to
high and low temperatures, discovered the important fact that the chromosomes
of cells which were produced at low temperatures might be two or three times larger
than those formed under warmer conditions. Probably this difference is to be
attributed to the more rapid succession of mitoses at the higher temperature, and
the consequent curtailment of opportunity for growth on the part of the chromosomes.
Mors (1909) also drew attention to the fact that, during spermatogenesis in the

cockroach (Periplaneta Americana), the dimensions of the nuclei and of the
chromosomes are larger in the earlier than they are in the later spermatogonial
divisions.
