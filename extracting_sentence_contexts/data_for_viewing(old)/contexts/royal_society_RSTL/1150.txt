tortoise, Seem to be a connecting link between 'those of the
animals in question, and those-of serpents and lizards.

Perhaps additional facts are not required to prove, that
the-secretion.of the kidneys of animals depends more on the
intimate and -invisible structure of these organs, than on the
kind of food the animals consume ; were such facts wanting,
there would be no difficulty in furnishing them. How dif-
ferent is the urine of the brown-toad and that of any species
of small lizards ! yet flies are the favourite and common diet
of both animals. Other remarkable instances might be men-
tioned, of similarity of diet and difference of urinary secretion ;
and, vice versa, instances might be afforded of difference of
diet and similarity of urine : I will mention one only ; it is that
of parrots and snakes ; their urine, as I have found, being
much the same, consisting chiefly of uric acid, though their
diet is altogether different, the birds feeding entirely on vege-
table matter, and the reptiles entirely on animal matter, But
let me not be supposed to maintain that the urinary secretion
