80 by exposure to hydrogen, the same series should be re-produced in the inverse
order, if it act only by removing oxygen. This, however, does not take place ; on the
contrary, it appears that as from C1, Hjy N O,, there is formed by oxygen C;, Hy,

the facts be given. That deoxidation is not the characteristic process, obtains also
probability from the fact, that neither sulphurous acid, nor a solution of a suIphite, has
any effect upon azolitmine, either free or in alkaline combination. The sulphurous acid
reddens litmus as any other acid, but has no power whatsoever to remove its colour.

There is no circumstance, in the history of the colouring bodies, of more interest
than that of the bleaching powers of chlorine ; whether considered as affording the
theory of a process, 80 long and s0 deservedly esteemed one of the most important
applications of chemistry to the arts, or examined with regard to testing by its means
the generality and exactness of the important views recently deduced, concerning the
constitution of organic bodies, from the results of the action of chlorine upon them,
by studying in a new class of substances, how far the principle on which it acts may
be modified or confirmed. Before the study of organic chemistry had attained the
accuracy which it now possesses, chlorine was considered to bleach by decomposing
