A NEW CONSTITUENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE, 215

Mr. Crookes, who a short time ago called attention to the flame rising from platinum
‘terminals, which convey a high tension alternating electric discharge, and pointed
out its dependence upon combustion of the nitrogen and oxygen of the air.*
Mr. Crookes was kind enough to arrange an impromptu demonstration at his own
house with a small alternating current plant, in which it appeared that the absorp-
tion of mixed gas was at the rate of 500 cub, centims. per hour, or nearly 20 times
as fast as with the battery. The arrangement is similar to that first described by
Srorriswoopr.t The primary of a RuumKorrr coil is connected directly with the
alternator, no break or condenser being required; so that, in fact, the coil acts
Simply as a high potential transformer. When the arc is established the platinum
Serminals may be separated much beyond the initial striking distance.
& The plant with which the large scale operations have been made consists of a
© Merrirens alternator, kindly lent by Professor J. J. Taomson, and a gas engine.
As transformer, one of Swinpurne’s hedgehog pattern has been employed with
Success, but the ratio of transformation (24:1) is scarcely sufficient. A higher
Gotential, although, perhaps, not more efficient, is more convenient. The striking
Blistance is greater, and the are is not so liable to go out. Accordingly most of the
Spork to be described has been performed with transformers of the RuumKorrr type.
& The apparatus has been varied greatly, and it cannot be regarded as having even
‘Jet assumed a final form. But it will give a sufficient idea of the method if we
Hescribe an experiment in which a tolerably good account was kept of the air and
