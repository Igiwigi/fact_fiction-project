coefficients p can be obtained as p = DMâ„¢1.

We apply the two methods to a single FHN oscillator that receives 400 random impulses
(stimulus duration: t = 20, stimulus strength: V=0.01,0.02,...,0.12) as external forcing G(t).
Parameter values of the FHN oscillator and the sampling time interval were set to be the same
as those in the previous sections. For simplicity, natural frequency w and the external signal
G(t) were assumed to be known. The number of the Fourier components was set to D= 10. The
integration time was set to T= 150. For impulse strength of E=0.01 and E = 0.04, the estimated
phase sensitivity functions are drawn in figure 3b,c, respectively. In both panels (b) and (c),
estimation results of the multiple shooting method (solid red lines) are consistent with those of
the adjoint method [65]. The least-square method (dashed blue line), on the other hand, recovered
the phase sensitivity function faithfully for a small impulse strength in (b). The estimate is,
however, deviated from the other two curves for a large impulse strength in (c). In fact, as the
impulse strength is increased, the estimation error increases much more rapidly in the least-
squares method (dashed blue line) than the multiple shooting method (solid red line) (figure 3d).
The least-squares method [43,46] assumes that phase of the oscillator evolves linearly in time
according to the natural frequency. This approximation is effective as far as the external force is
weak. If stronger perturbations are applied, inducing non-small phase shifts, this approximation
increases the estimation error. The multiple-shooting method, on the other hand, takes into
account the phase shift induced by the external perturbations by faithfully integrating the phase
equation (4.1). The estimation error has been therefore reduced by the multiple-shooting method.

(b) Chaotic phase synchronization

Next we show how the estimated coupling function can be used for modelling chaotic phase
