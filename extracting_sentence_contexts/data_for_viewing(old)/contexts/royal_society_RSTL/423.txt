siderable portion either of the brain or spinal marrow. Itis
as readily influenced by agents applied to the anterior part
of the brain, as by those applied to the cervical part of the
spinal marrow. This is what we should expect when we
trace the various origins of its nerves.

If it be said that the results of these experiments imply a
contradiction, that we cannot suppose the power of the heart
to be wholly independent of the brain and spinal marrow,
and yet influenced by stimuli applied to them, the reply is,
that such are the facts, of the truth of which any one may
easily satisfy himself. Daily occurrences correspond with these
facts. We rarely see the action of the heart destroyed by
injuries of the brain and spinal marrow, unless they are such
as interrupt respiration ; yet its action is constantly influenced
by affections of the mind, '

On a closer examination of the phenomena of the nervous
system, we hall find other similar difficulties. The experi-
ments of M. LE GaLLots prove, in the most satisfactory
manner, that a principal function of the spinal marrow is to
excite the muscles of voluntary motion, and that it can per-
form this office independently of the brain. It performs it
