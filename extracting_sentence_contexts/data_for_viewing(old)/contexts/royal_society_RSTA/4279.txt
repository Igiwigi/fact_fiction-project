of these processes in classical physics is mechanics, which is now replaced by QM, as a non-realist
theory that only predicts, in probabilistic or statistical terms, the effects (observed in measuring
instruments) of such processes without representing them.

Although this elaboration may appear to announce a programme different from the one Bohr
came to follow later, defined by his emphasis of the irreducible role of measuring instruments in
quantum physics, by taking this view one would miss Bohr’s understanding of the significance


of mathematics in QM. From ‘Atomic theory and mechanics’ on, Bohr always saw quantum El
physics as defined by the essential roles of both measuring and mathematical instruments, of
experimental and mathematical technologies, in their reciprocal relationships. The very appeal
to ‘instruments’ is hardly casual. Apart from the fact that such choices of expression are never
casual in Bohr, the point is consistent with Bohr’s view of mathematics, as also (although not
only) a technology of thought, specifically in physics [69].

Experimental technology is a broader concept than ‘measuring instruments’, and it would,
for example, involve devices that make it possible to apply the measuring instruments or
other devices. More generally, technology is a means of doing something, and doing it more
successfully than previously. The experimental technology of quantum physics enables us
to understand how Nature works at the ultimate level of its constitution (in Bohr and the
present view, via the effects of quantum objects on measuring devices), or obtaining and using
information through quantum phenomena, which quantum objects enable us to have and =
manipulate, as in quantum cryptography and computing. Quantum objects themselves are not :
technology; they are something technology helps us to discover, understand, work with and
