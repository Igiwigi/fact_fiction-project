An even stronger restriction would be to only allow ‘cuts’, with fOM=
{Xp X1p1/-++/XN} OF {X1,X2,.--, X11}. AB Cc D x

Stronger restrictions on possible dichotomizations translate into stronger restrictions on the pairs : 3
Ry Re whose canonical representation is contextual. This fact is especially important if one 12
considers expanding CbD beyond categorical rvs. Thus, it is easy to see that if one considers mea)
all possible dichotomizations of two conteNt-sharing rvs with continuous densities on the set of :
real numbers, then the system will be contextual whenever the two distributions are not identical. a]
Let the densities of these rvs be f(x) and g(x) shown in the graphic above. If the set of all splits DNS
of these rvs forms a non-contextual system, then any discretization of these rvs should satisfy aon
corollary 4.5 to theorem 4.4.
