In the curve the straight line represented by Mrs. Ayrron’s equation is also given.

observed P.D.’s is very marked, the error in the calculated result being no less
than 32°6 volts for an are length of 30 millims. At the same time this is not due to
any difference in the nature of the carbons, since the actual experimental values
obtained by Mrs. Ayrron,* and on which her equation is based, fit the Curve VII.
with considerable accuracy. The whole of this large difference between Mrs. AYRTON’S
equation and the experimental results is due to the fact that the equation is based on
the range of are lengths of from 1 millim. to 7 millims., and that the equation no
longer represents the facts if we extrapolate any considerable amount. Even over
the range of from 1 millim. to 7 millims. the connection between the P.D. and length
for constant current is not accurately a straight line, as can be seen either in
Curve VII. or by a careful examination of Mrs. Ayrron’s experimental results.

Tf the are length was kept constant and the current varied, a similar difficulty was
found with very small currents of 1°5 ampéres and lower, namely, that the observed
P.D. was less than the calculated P.D., so that Mrs. Ayrron’s equation can only be
considered as approximately representing the facts within the limits she used, and
must not be applied to very small currents or long are lengths.
