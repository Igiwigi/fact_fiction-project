4. Concluding remarks

The action principle has been studied for the Fokker—Planck equation, and the associated weak
invariant has been shown to be the Noether charge generating the transformation, under which
the action remains unchanged.

It is noted that the variational approach discussed in the present work is radically different
from the one that is directly applied to thermodynamic variables and is somewhat criticized
in [37].

The theory developed here is free from a specific form of a kinetic equation (at least, as long
as it is linear). For example, it is straightforward to apply it to fractional kinetics with spatio-
temporal non-locality. In fact, the action principle for the fractional Fokker—Planck equation and
the corresponding canonical theory have already been constructed [29].

It is also pointed out that there have been continuous research activities of non-local non-
equilibrium thermodynamics [38-41]. It may be of interest to examine such discussions from
the viewpoint of generalized kinetics as in the traditional shift from the kinetic stage to the
hydrodynamic one. Weak invariants and their possible roles in generalized kinetics are yet to
be explored.

As long as limited to genuine classical thermodynamics, the bath implies the heat bath even in
the non-equilibrium regime, and accordingly exotic baths such as the energy bath mentioned
in §1 do not exist there. However, the thermodynamic formalism has high-level universality.
Thermodynamic analogues are ubiquitously observed in various fields such as econophysics,
