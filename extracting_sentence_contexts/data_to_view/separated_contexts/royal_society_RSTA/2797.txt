Crater density and crater flux models indicate a global average model surface age (AMSA) of ca 750
+350/—400 Ma [53]. AMSA represents an integrated geologic history; it is not an absolute age, nor
does it reflect a singular unique history. In fact, crater density together with crater modification
data [54,55] reveal three separate AMSA provinces of sub-equal areal distribution (figure 1b)
[10,11]. The lack of spatial correlation between these AMSA provinces with topography, crustal
plateaux (old), tesserae (old), volcanic rises (young) and fracture zone terrain (young) suggests a
rich surface history. Although we currently have no means to determine the absolute geologic
time represented by Venus’ surface, Monte Carlo modelling indicates that the impact crater
characteristics held up as ‘evidence’ for catastrophic resurfacing (near-pristine, near-random
distribution, etc.) can be accommodated by plausible geologic histories spanning several billion
years [56-58].
