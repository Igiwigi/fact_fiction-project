Olefiant gas is similarly affected, but not
to the same extent. The glass tube is much blackened, but the spectrum is constant. BgrTHeLoT has, in fact, already shown that olefiant gas is decomposed by the electric
current, acetylene being at the same time produced. Indeed, as acetylene may, accord-
ing to BerTHELOT, be formed from its elements under the influence of the electric dis-
charge, it is inconceivable that a hydrocarbon gas could be perfectly decomposed in
such a tube as I have described. The spectrum under investigation having then been obtained in one case when only
carbon and hydrogen were present, and in another when all elements but carbon and
nitrogen were absent, furnishes, to my mind, sufficient evidence that the spectrum is
that of carbon.
