animal was placed on its back the motions to recover its position were feeble and
ineffectual, and almost entirely ceased without the body recovering its natural posi-
tion. But motions were instantly re-excited when pressure was made over any of the
ganglia; and the limbs, both anterior and posterior to the ganglion pressed on,
were thrown into violent actions on both sides of the body, exactly as in the original

experiment on the Lobster. Pressure on the cut extremity of the neryous cord, in
the posterior half of the body, induced scarcely any movements. When the anterior
portion of the body, with three or four pairs of legs attached, was separated from the
posterior, there were acts of progression as in Iulus. But the most striking fact was,
that when that portion of brain which had been removed from the head in connexion
with the antennal ganglion and antenna was irritated, contractions were immediately
excited in the joints of the antenna. How difficult to understand is the influence
of that power which resides in this mysterious centre of all the animal movements !

Experiment 14.â€”The body was divided at a stroke between the second and third
pairs of legs. Sensation was perfect in the head and two pairs of legs, with which there
were voluntary attempts at locomotion. But volition and sensation were s0oner lost
than in Tulus, and this also was the case with the reflected movements, all which had
ceased in less than three hours. In each of these experiments on Lithobius sensation
and volition ceased in the anterior portion of the body in a few minutes, and sooner
in proportion to the fewer legs connected with the head. Reflex actions continued to
