can proliferate rapidly and give rise to all kinds of tissue, nervous, digestive,
muscle, gonadial, heart, etc., if there be need.

These statements suggest that the maintenance of a high degree of differentiation
is incompatible with cell division, at least rapid enough to be of use in regeneration ;
that moderate differentiation and rapid cell division are compatible although the direc-
tion of differentiation seems to be irreversible ; while totipotency is to be associated
with tissues, such as limiting inner membranes that have never become moderately
differentiated.

It is obvious from the foregoing pages that the primary germ layers have no
significance in bud development and that only the degree of differentiation of
a tissue is of importance. The germ layer theory was, in fact, shown to be invalid
with regard to adult organisms and to be merely part of embryonic mechanics by
Hrorr (1896), in his famous monograph.

XIIâ€”Conctusions AND SUMMARY

The nature of budding is described for twenty genera of ascidians, in eight for
the first time.
