was gone through. In every case the magnetic force was put through 20 cycles of
reyersal before the magnetic observations were made.

One effect of the cycles of twisting was to diminish the “permanent set” of the
wire. Thus, reckoning from the position of the wheel when the wire was set free
after a twist of 50 revolutions, 10 cycles with the load between the limits of

+ 300 grammes caused the wheel to turn back through $ revolution.

It will be noticed that the curves in figs. 13, 14 do not always form closed figures.
This is probably in the main due to the fact that the preliminary cycles of twisting
were gone through in a few minutes, while the one during which the tests for
B, and W were made occupied about an hour. We have often observed a similar
effect when a copper wire is put through cycles of loading and unloading. There is in
this case so much “creeping” when a load is applied, that, if a cycle of loading and
unloading with a given range of load is performed slowly after a number of cycles of
loading and unloading performed comparatively quickly with the same range of load,
the curve connecting the elongation and the load is not closed.

The curves exhibit in a highly developed form the want of symmetry which was
rudimentary in the experiments of § 58 (fig. 11).

In every case the maximum magnetic force was kept at the constant value
