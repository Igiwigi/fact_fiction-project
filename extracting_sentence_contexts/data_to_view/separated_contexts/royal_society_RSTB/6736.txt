All we may perhaps permit ourselves to say to-day is that
some viruses, like the X virus, are complex organic particles endowed with but a few of
the characters encountered in the simplest known living organisms. Such viruses fit into
neither of the accepted categories of the living and non-living. The facts are there: we
must adjust our concepts to them. The writer desires to express his deep gratitude to his former colleague Mr F. C.
Bawden and to his present colleague Dr R. Dennis for the unstinted assistance they
have rendered him throughout the whole course of these investigations. It is not too
much to say that without their generous co-operation this work could not have been
brought to a conclusion.
