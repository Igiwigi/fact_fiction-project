But apart from its
theoretical import, we lay stress on the fact as showing augmentation of excitability
in the presence of opposed electromotive forces. We may observe further that with
strong induction currents it does not appear, that with subminimal induction currents
the increase is alone seen and only with greater strength of the galvanic current, and
that exceptionally with induction currents of moderate strength the increase brought
about by the galvanic current appears without previous decrease. In seeking confirmation of the hypothesis applied to the fact expressed in the
preceding statement, we were led to look for an analogous effect with the combined
induction kathode and galvanic anode, and found ourselves entitled to qualify
statement, 4 by the following statement :—

9. With inereasing strength of the galvanic current, the effect of the kathode of the
break induction current, when that kathode is als anode of the galvanic current,
diminishes to « minimum, and with further increase in the strength of the galvanic
eurrent increases, but not up to the original normal within endurable strength of the
galvanic current. After several failures we verified this statement with moderate strength of the
induction current.
