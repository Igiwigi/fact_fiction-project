(gsin @/uy) tis distinctly less than unity.

For different values of @ and uy we get a variety of paths which can be easily plotted;
we may call them “neutral’’ phugoids, since they are distinguished by the fact that
the machine is statically neutral. The statically neutral aeroplane is dealt with by
R. Fuchs and L. Hopf (ibid. pp. 235-9), but no explicit general solution is given.
