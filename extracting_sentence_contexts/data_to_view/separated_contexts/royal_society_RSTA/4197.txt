We adopt the analogous
requirement here, that the set of subgroup elements (as points of R°) be discrete. This restriction
is a strong requirement [19,20], which restricts the value of S, the composition function x and the
form of the Lie algebra g. In fact (with some technical assumptions) there are just three classes
of three-dimensional Lie groups that have discrete subgroups, according to Auslander et al. [19],
and I concentrate here on results available for just one of those classes. So take

Xe yex+yt Zuplp-xAy), (6.5)


where it turns out that jz must be a rational number and that the components of p € R° can be | 2 |

taken to be relatively prime integers, if there are to exist discrete subgroups D C G. One calculates

that, with e, = 1,(0), 3
Ta(x) = en + Spx Ap-ea), e=x, a=1,2,3, (6.6) 1B

by the process given above, so that from (6.6)2 elements of the Lie algebra can be identified with :e
elements of the group.
