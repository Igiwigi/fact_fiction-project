that that is explicable by the ventral ends of the root fields being wider than the
dorsal ends of them, and that the difference is greatest for the lowest two thoracic
and the highest lumbar segments.

In the animal body the greatest departure from a simple and regular figure is
caused in the vertebrate forms by the excrescence of the limbs. How does the
segmentation of the body behave in the region of the limbs? In the Frog it has been
shown above that the simple zonal character of the root-fields, although disturbed in
the hind limb, is not actually departed from and is still easy to perceive. “The
cutaneous field for each posterior root meets the middle line of the body both
ventrally and dorsally.” Each root-field sweeps down the limb and up again upon it,
so that the free apex of the limb is by this test about equidistant from the mid-
ventral and mid-dorsal lines; the digits are, in fact, so many points on the lateral
line of the body, as they were shown to be at the earlest origin in the embryo. The
most segmentally anterior portion of the skin of the hind-limb of the Frog is found to
occupy the extensor aspect (front) of the thigh. Next come the extensor and peroneal
aspects of the leg, then the dorsum pedis, the sole, the calf, and, finally, the most
segmentally posterior is the flexor aspect (back) of the thigh. It is the comparatively
small number of nerve-roots distributed to the hind limb of Rana that in its case
makes the arrangement of such an obvious kind, The skin of the limb in Rana is
supplied practically by four roots only.’

Turning to Macacus rhesus, one finds that if the surface of the limb be considered
to be bounded proximally by Poupart’s ligament, and by a line passing from the
anterior superior spine backwards over the ischial tuberosity to the genital fold, the
