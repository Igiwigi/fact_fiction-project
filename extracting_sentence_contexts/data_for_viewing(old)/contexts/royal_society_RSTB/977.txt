behaviour of the secondary and tertiary compounds, it is highly probable that, on
account of their great instability, they would at once undergo hydrolysis on coming
into contact with the acid of actively contracting muscle, and that the separated
nitrous acid would then immediately react. The slowness with which the nitrites
of high molecular weight act may be ascribed to the circumstances that these
bodies enter much less readily into combination, and are far more stable than the
: secondary and tertiary compounds. The weak chemical union between the nitrites
and certain constituents of blood and muscle, of which their physiological action
affords indications, although substantiated to some extent as regards the blood by the
eexperiments of GAMGEE, requires detailed chemical study with respect to the nature
‘we the compound, as well as to its modes of decomposition.
2 In conclusion, the following are the principal facts which have been established with
Zeference to the connection between the various phases of the physiological action of
Ahese nitrites and their chemical constitution.
S In respect of all phases of the physiological action, the secondary and tertiary
Sitrites are more active than the corresponding primary compounds. ‘This is to be
Bhiefly attributed, not to the direct physiological effect of the secondary and tertiary
groups, but to the great facility with which these compounds suffer decomposition.
a In respect of the acceleration of the pulse, the power of the nitrites varies directly as
‘Sheir molecular weights, and they therefore fall into an order identical with that, of
she homologous series. This same relationship, increase of activity corresponding
“vith rise in molecular weight, may also be traced, though less uniformly, in their
power of reducing blood-pressure and of inducing muscular contraction.
4 This order appears to be the result, not so much of the direct influence of the
