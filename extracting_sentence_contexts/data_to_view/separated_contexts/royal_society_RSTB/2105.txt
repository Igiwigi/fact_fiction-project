As in the adults and older embryos the pelvic girdle of the embryo is nearly
always pierced by the 29th spinal nerve. Only in one instance out of six was it
pierced by the 30th nerve, and then only by a branch from the latter (fig. 7 F
and also fig. 2 F). These facts preclude the possibility of limb migration occurring
during the ontogeny of the individual, such as has been described by Mouirer in the
case of Torpedo (1893). :

General Considerations. It was stated in the introductory part of this paper that the main object of this
investigation was to ascertain whether, at any period of the development of the
animal selected, the number of branches composing the nervus collector was greater
than that found in the adult. As a logical consequence of GEGENBAUR’s theory we
should expect such to be the case, and the ontogenetic history of the nervus collector,
its maximum development in young embryos, and its subsequent gradual decrease
through the later stages of embryonic existence leading to its condition in the adult,
must, if there is any truth in the recapitulation theory, all point to its primitive
character.
