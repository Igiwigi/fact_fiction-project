Even the
Ungulata, in which the membrane is by far the most developed and active, blink
freely, Consequently the primary use of this third lid, viz. that of cleaning the
corneal surface, is lost within the class of the Mammalia, and its preservation in the
Ungulata calls for a special explanation. Now the Ungulata alone are those which “ graze” in the proper sense of the word. They poke their heads down into the long and sharp grass, while they are notoriously
those which have most need of being on the alert for the Carnivores, their natural
enemies ; in fact, they have to keep their eyes open all the time, and these are, in
addition, rather large. The fully developed nictitans protects the cornea from injury,
and sweeps with great rapidity over it and back again into its concealed position.*
That the primary object of this third lid is that of sweeping is obvious enough. It
exists fully developed in all the lower classes of vertebrates, from Elasmobranchs and
Amphibia through the Reptiles and Birds, with a few special exceptions, ¢.g., Snakes,
where it is lost for obvious reasons.
