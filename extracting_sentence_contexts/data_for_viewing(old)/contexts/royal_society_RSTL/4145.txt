for containing a gasiform fluid, which could not escape detection when they coalesce
and adhere to the glass. Globules of gas, of whatever nature, cannot possibly be
confounded with one of these liquid globules, from their being much darker, and
the smallest of them considerably larger than those of water, independently of their
remaining permanent when inclosed between two surfaces of glass. In Canada
balsam they present, on a very minute scale, the exact representation of external
objects which surround the microscope, which, however, is seen on liquid globules
when they are sufficiently large. Thus, in looking through the microscope, I have
seen at the lower part of one of these air-globules portions of my own face or body ;
and in the same way an extensive view of trees, houses, &c. may be traced with all
its details on one of these microscopic globules not larger than 0-01” or 0:02”,
Fig. 3 represents the image of part of the hand, as seen in a globule of air, drawn
under the camera lucida. I mention this fact, as I believe that the telescopic action
of the microscope, by means of these hollow prisms, may be capable of several
interesting applications.

By breathing gently on the snrface of Canada balsam, it will become covered with
a film of moisture, reflecting various colours in proportion to the quantity deposited.
Any bright object viewed through it will appear surrounded by a halo of brilliant
colours, such as those seen sometimes encircling the sun or moon. These coloured
films, under the microscope, are decomposed into colourless particles of water, which
