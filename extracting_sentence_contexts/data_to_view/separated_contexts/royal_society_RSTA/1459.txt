For completeness, the corresponding resolution limit for any
combination of illumination (NAjj),) and detection (NAget) apertures in imaging of elastically
scattered light is described by

ra

d=—__*~__ (1.2)
NAinu + NAget

which holds both for oblique coherent illumination at the border of the illumination NA as well
as incoherent illumination up to this numerical aperture. Note that most microscopy users use
full-aperture incoherent illumination via a condenser, which leads to a massive loss in contrast
at medium to high spatial frequencies. Only very careful observation shows that by increasing
the illumination NA the resolution limit is in fact increased, despite the apparent loss in contrast. Abbe’s oblique illumination geometry was in this respect very helpful to maintain contrast. In
fact, the same lateral resolution limit (equation (1.2)) also applies to confocal microscopy imaging
scattering samples.
