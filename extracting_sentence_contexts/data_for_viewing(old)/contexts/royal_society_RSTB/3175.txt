space, therefore, is wholly unrepresented in sublimate material, and its presence in
other material must be an artifact due to shrinkage during fixation. Indirectly the
absence of the clear space in sublimate material is due to the greater capacity of this
reagent for fixing simple proteids in the absence of a free acid ; for the coagulation
of these waste or metaplastic substances with which the yolk nucleus and general
cytoplasm are loaded prevents the shrinkage which produces this space in other
material. That this is the explanation of the absence of the clear space in sublimate
material is very clearly shown by the fact that, even in acid fixed material, there is
no clear space accompanying the yolk nucleus when this structure is faintly stained,
and when it is, therefore, presumably less heavily loaded with non-coagulable
material (figs. 28 and 42).

In the second place, both the clear space and the yolk nucleus of the older oocytes
have lost the regular form they possessed in earlier stages, and it is then frequently
seen that the outline of the clear space corresponds exactly with that of the yolk
nucleus, a correspondence which can only be explained by supposing that the two
surfaces were originally in contact and have been separated by shrinkage (fig. 38),
and is wholly incompatible with the supposition that the space is caused by an
accumulation of fluid material in the living egg. This interpretation of the space
as a split due to shrinkage is also supported by the presence, on the surface of the
