1. Arteria cerebrales posteriores (figs. 1, 2, a.c.p.). A posterior cerebral artery
éomes off close to the point of division of the internal carotid and takes a somewhat
sinuous course upwards between the optic lobe and the cerebral hemisphere. At
about the level of the top of the optic lobe it divides into two branches, one, which
I propose to term the saccular artery, running upwards alongside the dorsal sac, and
the other, which I propose to term the superior cerebral, running forwards over the
top of the cerebral hemisphere.

la. Arteria sacculares (fig. 1, a.s.).—The saccular artery of each side runs
upwards close alongside the wall of the dorsal sac and supplies the corresponding
half of the choroid plexus of the dorsal sac. It also gives off branches to the wall
of the pineal gland, especially (on one side) two important branches, the anterior and
posterior pineal arteries. It is a remarkable fact that these branches may be given
off from either the right or the left saccular artery.

la’. Arteria pinealis anterior (fig. 1, «.p.a.).—This is an unpaired vessel which
runs forward beneath the pineal gland (= “ pineal stalk”) and ultimately
accompanies the pineal nerve to the pineal eye.

la”. Arteria pinealis posterior (fig. 1, a.p.p.).—This runs backwards to the
posterior portion of the pineal gland, lying at first between the wall of
the pineal gland and the dorsal sac.

In one specimen the arrangement of the saccular arteries and their branches is as
follows, as determined by a series of sections parallel to the sagittal plane. On the
