The more intense the compression-wave, the more rapid the
= combustion in its path, and the more rapid the cooling in its wake.
=) The “kick-off” which the explosion gets when the gases are fired near one end of
sa tube considerably modifies the initial progress of the flame, especially when this is
E comparatively slow: compare fig. 66 where the spark is passed af the end of the
E tube, with fig. 67, where the spark is passed 4 inches from the end of a similar tube.
6 For this reason the experiments made on the time required in different gases to
xg develop the detonation showed anomalies which only disappeared on firing the gases
3 by means of wires which just penetrated through the stopper at the end of the tube.
g The mean distance in which the detonation is developed in different gases is shown in
= the following table, according to the position of the spark :—

The mixtures most affected by the position of the spark among those experimented
_ with are those of hydrogen and oxygen. The considerable “run” required before
_ the detonation is set up when electrolytic gas is diluted, confirms my previous

experiments on the rate of explosion of these mixtures.

centre of a tube. 1 the flame overtakes the sound-wave before it reaches the ends
of the tube, as in fig. 61, the explosion exhibits intense retonation-waves followed by
rapid cooling; but when the sound-waves are first reflected from the ends of the
} tube, as in fig, 65, the explosion shows less intense waves and a longer illumination,*
These differences in the mode of burning must affect the maximum temperatures and
pressures produced in an explosion.
