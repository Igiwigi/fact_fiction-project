Line 243 \ = 5080°70 is apparently reversed and displaced towards the violet, but
this is found to be due to the strengthening under pressure of a faint line on its violet
edge.

(5) Displacement Diagrams.—In Diagram 1 lines are drawn connecting the
different readings of the displacements at different pressures of a few of the spectrum
lines dealt with, and each line represents the behaviour of one spectrum line. The
proportionality between the displacement and the pressure is apparent from the
diagram, and is approximately linear. In Section 7, p. 224, this point is further
examined. ‘The diagram further illustrates the fact that the lines are capable of
resolution into two groups according to their rates of displacement, a feature which is
more fully treated later. The diagram includes both reversed and bright lines, but does not distinguish
between them. Without exception the former fall into the group with the
smaller displacement.
