that it did not contain any thing entitling it to this appellation. Tt extended from 12
feet south of the entrance to near the mouth of the Steep Slide Hole, and lay imme-
diately beneath the firs: bed. Its greatest thickness did not exceed 1 foot, which it
attained about 2 feet from its commencement, and it gradually thinned out southwards.
No organic remains were found in it, nor did any thing resembling it occur elsewhere in
the cavern.

The Third Bed, s8ometimes called the Loam Bed and the Bone Bed, consisted of
a reddish-brown, tenacious, clayey loam, and contained a large number of angular and
subangular fragments of limestone, which varied in size from very small bits to masses
weighing even a ton. The large blocks were found only in the West and South Cham-
bers, and in the gallery connecting them, where the angular character of the roof, unlike
that which obtained elsewhere, as well as the fact that the blocks were confined to the
upper portion and surface of the deposit beneath, showed that they had fallen from aboye
at a comparatively recent period. Pebbles of quartz, trap, and limestone were of frequent
occurrence, especially in the Flint-knife Gallery and in the West Chamber. Nodules of
iron-ore, well rounded, as if by travel, were occasionally met with in both the principal
galleries. Dr. Percy pronounced them all to be specimens of the brown or hydrous
hematite. Fragments of stalagmite, apparently portions of an old floor, were also
found in this bed in the Wes: Chamber, the western part of the Flint-knife Gallery,
and in the Steep Slide Holeâ€”portions of the cavern in which it does not appear that
a floor of this kind ever existed. Some of them measured as much as 18 inches square,
and from 3 to 4 inches thick, At least a cartload of this material must haye been
found.
