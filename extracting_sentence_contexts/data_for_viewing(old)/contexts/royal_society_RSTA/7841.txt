special case for ¢ = 1), if k = 1, while if k > 1, R, + s/s, depending only on the

total scattering coefficients of the air. The latter case, of course, corresponds to

an ozone concentration which decreases to zero at infinite height, proportionally
to m‘', or, if the atmosphere is exponential (at least at great heights) to e“~'”.

The case k <1 corresponds to an ozone concentration increasing indefinitely
upwards. I have shown* that such a distribution is improbable, and that, in fact,
above a certain height the concentration is likely to decrease. Thus we may expect
that (on a plane earth) the limiting value R,, will be s’/s.

When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, it is difficult to obtain J,
in terms of known functions, and especially so unless the air density is distributed
exponentially. Hence only exponential atmospheres will be considered in the
present case.

If the atmosphere is uniformly exponential, then
