It is associated from our point of view with the net of lines of the
plane w as we remarked above. But from the analytical point of view it is as simple as
could be. In fact if we take II to be z= 0, and / to be y = z = u = 0, and the conic
to be y® — za =u=t=0, then the direct and reverse transformations are given

by :—

X =f —a@ x = Y?— UX

respectively, so that the transformation is exactly symmetrical. ‘l'o planes of 1 through /
there correspond points of the base conic of ¥"; and to the whole prime containing
Land ¢, there corresponds the line of contact I’ of the quadrics 1’. Also to the neigh-
bourhood of any point of | there corresponds one point of I’.

{2, 4 (3), 4}. In this transformation quadrics of ® touch a given prime TI along a given line | of the
prime and pass through three fixed points P, Q, R.
