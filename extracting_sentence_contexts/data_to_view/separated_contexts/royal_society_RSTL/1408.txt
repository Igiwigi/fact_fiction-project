Few substances, perhaps, have less claim to be considered as
acid, than oxymuriatic acid. As yet we have no right to say
that it has been decompounded ; and as its tendency of com-
bination is with pure inflammable matters, it 'may possibly
belong to the same class of bodies as oxygene. May it not in fact be a pecutzar acidifying and dissolving
principle, forming compounds with combustible bodies, ana-
logous to acids containing oxygene, or oxides, in'their pro-
perties and powers of combination ; but differing from them,
in being for the most part, decomposable by water? On this
idea muriatic acid may be considered as having hydrogene
for its basis, and oxymuriatic acid for its acidifying principle. And the phosphoric sublimate as having phosphorus for its
basis, and oxymuriatic acid for its acidifying matter.
