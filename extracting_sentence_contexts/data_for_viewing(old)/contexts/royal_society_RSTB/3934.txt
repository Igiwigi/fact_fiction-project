usual type for such characters, the deviations of the parents being partially inherited
by the offspring with regression to the population mean. The correlation between
parent and offspring was given in 1909 as 0°336 +0°012. (2) On the other hand,
when single pure lines were considered separately he found, that though the
distribution of the variants round the mean also followed the normal curve, the >
inheritance was of quite a different type, the correlation between parent and offspring ;

being in fact nz. This is to say, considering a pure line as a population by itself,
the deviations of the parents from the population mean were not inherited at all.
In 1909 he gives the correlation between parent and offspring for such a population
of 712 beans, all descended from a single ancestor; as —0°018 + 0°038, i.e. of no
significance ; (3) he also showed the non-inheritance of variation within the pure line
by selection. In his 1903 paper he gives the effects of selection for one generation, in
19 pure lines. The results are summarised in his “ Ubersichstabelle 4,” in which are
included 574 parent seeds belonging altogether to 19 pure lines, together with their
5494 offspring. The parent seeds are divided: into two classes, plus and minus
variants from the means of their respective pure lines, and it is shown that the mean
weight of the offspring of all the plus variants is to that of the offspring of the
minus variants as 98°5:100°9. That is, in the total the plus variants had actually
rather smaller offspring than the minus variants. In his book of 1909, chapter X, he
