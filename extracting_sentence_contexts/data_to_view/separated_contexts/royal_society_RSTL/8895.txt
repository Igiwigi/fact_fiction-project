Butterworthii, as a memorial of the valuable aid which its discoverer
has rendered me, by supplying me with specimens of the Oldham fossils, as well as by
his quickness in detecting new forms and his skill in preparing sections of them. Figs. 132, 133, & 134 represent three seeds from a slab of shale from Swinehill Col-
liery, near Stonehouse, Lanarkshire, for which I am indebted to Joun Youxs, Esq., of
the Glasgow Hunterian Museum*. The seeds are scattered over seyeral large slabs of
shale in great numbers, no two of them being exactly alike, save in the fact that they
are all compressed, as well as more or less fluted longitudinally. They also exhibit the
appearance of a surrounding margin ; but I suspect that this may merely have been a
result of pressure acting upon a thick testa, which would resist that pressure where it
was folded back upon itself. These seeds appear to me to agree with the figure and
description given by Dr.
