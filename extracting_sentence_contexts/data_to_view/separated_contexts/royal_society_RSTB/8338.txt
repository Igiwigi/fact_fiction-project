He (and others) argued that humans

had existed free of smallpox for millennia on several conti-
nents, seemingly showing that unoccupied niches pose no
hazard for pathogen emergence. He also emphasized that
monkeypox is not a new disease, and has probably been spil-
ling into human populations since ancient times. In fact, the
second point annuls the first. The absence of smallpox (and
measles and many other infections) from the Americas and
Australia is clearly an example of dispersal limitation. These
viruses emerged in humans in the Old World, from animal
hosts present only in the Old World [42].
