should be remembered, however, that the International Committee have not only
accepted Benorr, Fasry and Prror’s determination of the number of interference
fringes of Cd, (and therefore of the half, the number of wave-lengths) in the metre as
affording the standard length of the international metre, but as affording also the
primary standard wave-length of light, that of Cd,. Supposing, however, we entertain
the objection, the next best course is obviously to use the most trustworthy value
derived from other recent work, namely, that of Housvon for the brighter component
(predominatingly acting as shown below) of the doublet, 6562-8473. As he himself states
that this value is too low when referred to the cadmium standard, the true value must
be somewhat higher. When it is thus used (p. 312) to calculate the number of wave-
lengths of red cadmium light in the yard, the result is 1420205-9, as shown on p. 312,
4} wave-lengths less than when the author’s value is used directly. Or we can employ
the author’s neon result to calculate the wave-length of H,, from the facts that the yard
contains 1393290-5 H, wave-lengths and 1562408-6 Ne, wave-lengths, and using the
standard Ne, wave-length 5852-488 A.U. This affords the value for H, 6562-865 AU
These are the most probable alternatives when the author’s result is excluded. For it
is clear that the brighter component of the H, doublet is responsible for the bands at
the conclusion of the base-line count, the intensity having diminished to eventual
feebleness with increasing separation of the two reflecting surfaces up to 24 mm, If,
however, we use the value for the “ optical centre of gravity” of the doublet, that of
Curtis 6562-793, we obtain the number 1420194-1 for the Cd, wave-lengths in the yard,
15-7 wave-lengths lower than that derived from the neon determination. The mean
result of the neon and hydrogen determinations would then be 1420202-0 wave-
lengths of Cd, in the yard, supposing we assign an equal value to the Ne, and H,
determinations. But the author emphatically attributes a higher value to the neon
