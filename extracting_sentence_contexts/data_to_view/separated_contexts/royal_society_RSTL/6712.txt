The formula deduced from the observations, from which the conducting-powers were
calculated, was

A = 12-222 —0-040787e+0-00007088e?,

or
x =100—0-33372t+0-00057992,
corresponding to a percentage decrement of 27:573 per cent. From our experiments with alloys we should deduce that the cobalt and nickel wires

were not pure, and we are justified in making this statement by the fact that we have
not yet found any metal in a pure and solid state to decrease in conducting-power
between 0? and 100? less than 29-307 per cent., and, further, when we consider that,
although these metals may have been pure when in the state of powder, yet very little is
known about their behaviour to the crucibles at the high temperatures at which they fuse. It is well known how difficult it is to procure chemically pure iron in a fused state, on
account of its decomposing the crucibles in which it is melted and taking up some im-
purities. Assuming, therefore, that cobalt and nickel behave like most other pure metals,
namely, decrease in conducting-power between 0* and 100?, 29-307 per cent., we may
Mleduce from the above data the conducting-power of the pure metals.
