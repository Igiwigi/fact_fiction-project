qj in equation (3.14) arise from differentiation of the term fq{q2 in the Hamiltonian with :
respect to q1 and q2, where 6 = a), + a?) + a). In fact, this example is particularly attractive for : 2
demonstrating the present approach since energy exchange between the modes can be described :5
(to leading order) by this single nonlinear term. Also, as observed in the equation for q; in the ,
reduced-order model, 8 is essentially the amplitude of the parametric excitation provided to
mode 1 from mode 2, given by 2614291, and is therefore related to the stability region of the
linear parametric resonance of q1. The qj term in the equation for q2 captures the back-coupling of
the driven mode onto the driving mode, as required for passive coupling, which is beneficial in
frequency dividers [32]. The combined effect of this coupling is the possibility of energy transfer
between the modes when there is a two-to-one internal resonance.

The optimization problem for this resonance is therefore formulated as
