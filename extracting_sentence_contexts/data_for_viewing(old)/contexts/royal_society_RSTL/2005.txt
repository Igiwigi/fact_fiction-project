2 That there really exiſts in the blood a very ative and volatile
Principle, may very well be ſuſpeCted from ſeeing that the poi-
Jon of the viper prevents the coagulation of the blood when it is
grawn from the veſlels, whilſt, on the contrary, it produces a
oagulation of it within the veſſels. It may be ſuppoſed, that
omething evaporates from the blood when it is drawn out,
hich exiſts in it while within the veſſels. On this hypotheſis
is aQtive and vital principle may be conſidered as the reſult of
e whole animal oeconomy, not excluding the nerves which
may moſtly contribute to it. But all this is only mere con-
RCure, more or leſs probable, and unſupported by experiment,
FVe ought to abide by ſure facts, let the mode of explaining
Bcm be what it may. Now theſe fats are, that the American
Zoiſon does not aCt on the nerves, and that its a&tion is intirely
gn the blood.
2 Before my experiments no perſon would have doubted but
hat the a&tion of the American poiſon was immediately on the
erves.. All the external ſigns declared it to be ſo. Theſe ſigns
hen are equivocal, and they are falſely adopted by phyficians
Yr the certain proofs that a diſeaſe is purely nervous. All theſe
ymptoms may exiſt without the nerves being in the leaſt af-
ed : the alteration of the blood alone is-ſutficient to produce
iem in a moment. The principal phyſicians have attributed
