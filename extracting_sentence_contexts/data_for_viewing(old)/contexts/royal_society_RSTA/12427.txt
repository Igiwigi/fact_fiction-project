retical statical standpoint, and nothing short of actual experimental determination of
the strains produced and their exhaustive analysis would be sufficient to determine
the proper stress-function. But when the subject is attacked from the dynamical
standpoint, the indeterminateness disappears. From the two circuital laws of variable
states of electric and magnetic force in a moving medium, combined with certain dis-
tributions of stored energy, we are led to just one stress-vector, viz. (136). It is, in
the magnetic case, the same as (188); that is, it reduces to the latter when the
medium is kept at rest, so that J, and @, become J and G. -

It is of the simple type in case of isotropy (constant tensor), but is a rotational
stress in general, as indeed are all the statically probable stresses that suggest
themselves. The translational force due to it being divisible conveniently into (a)
the electromagnetic force on electric current, (b) the ditto on the fictitious electric
current taking the place of intrinsic magnetisation, (c) force depending upon space-
variation of »; we see that the really striking part is (b). Of all the various ways of
representing the forcive on an intrinsic magnet it is the most extreme. The magnetic
“matter” does not enter into it, nor does the distribution of magnetisation ; it is

where the intrinsic force hy has curl that the translational force operates, usually on

the sides of a magnet. From actual experiments with bar magnets, needles, &c., one
would naturally prefer to regard the polar regions as the seat of translational force,
