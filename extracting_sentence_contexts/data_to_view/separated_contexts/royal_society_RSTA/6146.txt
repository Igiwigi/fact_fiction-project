The microscopic evolution of the system is defined as a
low-level evolution process (LLEP) and, after some time, it will lead to a stable or metastable
emergent pattern, i.e. a high-level phenomenon (HLP). Note that we did not specify if f[-]
is deterministic or stochastic, and if the system is open or closed, since any combination of
them is plausible, in principle. In fact, if the system is open and the dynamical rules are
deterministic, the contingencies of the flux of parts and states through S provide additional
external conditions, whereas if the system is closed there is only one external condition, i.e.
the initial one. If the dynamics is stochastic, then accidental effects provide additional external
conditions. It is clear as a full knowledge of S, f[-], x9 and eventual external conditions
might allow, through computational analysis, to evolve microstates and observe unexpected
macrostates.
