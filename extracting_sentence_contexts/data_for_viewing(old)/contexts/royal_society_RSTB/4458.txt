The only other Lower Permian form which is sufficiently well known to be
compared with Capitosaurus is Trimerorachis, a very specialised aquatic type. This

animal differs just as does Eryopsin most characters, but it has already a very reduced
basisphenoid, and the apparent basipterygoid processes which have distinct articular
facets for the pterygoids seem to be mainly or entirely parasphenoid.

That Eryops is typical of the general structure of Rachitomi of its time is indicated
by the following facts :â€”

1. That a single occipital condyle, the middle portion of which is formed
by the basi-occipital, is known to occur in Archegosaurus, Chelydosaurus,
Actinodon, Trematops.

2. That definite slender basipterygoid processes are known in Archegosaurus,
Actinodon, Broiliellus, Cacops, Onchiodon, all of Lower Permian age.

3. That small descending processes of the tabular are known in Archegosaurus
and Actinodon.
