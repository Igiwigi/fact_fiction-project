and even if we suppose for a moment, that the chains made
use of in the measurement of the bases may-not admit of equal
precision with the rods of platina employed-in France, never-
theless, the degree of care employed in their construction;/ in
the mode of using them, and the pains taken to verify their
meagures was such, that no. error that. can have occurred-in
the length of the base, could make any perceptible difference
in the $ides of the series of triangles, of which the whole -ex-
tent does not amount to. s0. much as three degrees.

Nevertheless, the results deduced by the author, from this
measure alone, would lead to the: supposition that the earth,
instead of being flattened at the poles, is in fact more- elevated
at that part than at the equator, or at, least, that-its surface- is
not that of a regular solid. For; the, measures of different
degrees on the meridian, as reduced; by.Lieut. Col. Mupc,
increase progressively, toward the equator,

The following table of the different measures of a degree
in. fathoms is given by the author in his Memoir, f
