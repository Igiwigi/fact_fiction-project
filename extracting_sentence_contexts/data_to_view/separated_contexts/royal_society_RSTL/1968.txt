F. R. 8. I determined to preſent to the Society
the following account of ſome thermometrical experi-
ments and obſervations, the greateſt part of which were
made as long ago as the year 1776. The courſe of thoſe
experiments having been often interrupted by mechani-
cal defects in the conſtruction of infiruments, and by
yarious other circumſtances, muſt not be conſidered as
complete inveſtigations of the propoſed views, but rather
as firſt attempts, which are to be proſecuted in caſe of
better opportunities, They contain a few facts, which
to me ſeem new and worthy of notice; and, perhaps,
the obſervations concerning the conſtruftion and uſe of
the inſtruments uſeful in experiments of this ſort, may
be of uſe to thoſe perſons who have the opportunity, and

are willing, to proſecute this experimental inquiry. Vol. LXX, 4H Having

Having read in a volume of the Philoſophical Tranſ-
actions the account of an experiment made with a ther-
mometer, whoſe bulb.was painted black, and was expoſed
to the rays of the Sun, in which caſe it had been found,
that the thermometer ſhewed a much greater degree of
heat than when not blackened, I was deſirous of trying
the ultimate limits of this difference, For which purpoſe
I conftrudted two thermometers, the ſcales of which
(being made by trialYcoincided ſo perfetly well together,
that when the thermometers were put in equal circum=
ſtances, no difference could be perceived between the Ue<
grees of heat ſhewn by them. '
