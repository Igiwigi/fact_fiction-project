The second, or axis, consisted of a very narrow body irregularly elliptic;
with two surfaces, the upper of which presented a central hemispherical elevation
(odontoid process), and which, when the bone was placed 7 8itu, occupied the anterior
semicireular space between the articular facets of the atlas. This eminence was partt-
ally separated from the body of the axis by a well-defined fissure, situated transversely in
the posterior wall of the body of the vertebra, where the osseous incrustations or epl-

physial disks of two vertebra were distinctly visible, separated from each other by
rudimental articular surface, thus bearing out the theory promulgated by P
Owex, that the central elevation of the axis vertebra is in reality the homologue of
centrum or body, not of this segment, to which it would now seem to belong by o/
coalescence, but, of the atlas. This theory is further evidenced by the fact that t]
odontoid process appears to haye three points of ogzification, 5 first, a mall irregular
tached piece of bone imbedded in the apex of the elovation, ang which represents
upper epiphysial disk of the atlas; secondly, a point of ossification, but much larger, i
fact forming the greater part of the odontoid process, and coalescing anteriorly
laterally with the upper surface of the axis; and thirdly, a small flat thin plate which
formed the upper boundary of the transyerse fissure, before noticed as existing in the
posterior wall of the body or centrum of the bone,

Surrounding the hemispherical eminence, there was a crescentic-shaped depression,
which received the posterior articular surfacgs of the atlas. The posterior surface of the body of the axis was concave, and in outline irregularly
elliptical; it was slightly grooyed posteriorly. The neurapophyses arched backwards
and terminated in a bifid neural spine, which was more robust than that of the atlas.
