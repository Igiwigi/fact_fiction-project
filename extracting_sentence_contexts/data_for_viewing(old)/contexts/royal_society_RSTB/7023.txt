encloses the meristele. During the further development of the circum-stelar parenchyma
(some of which is of cortical origin, some of medullary origin and some of vascular origin)
the approximately square or rectangular cross-sectional outline of the lateral segment tends
to become circular. Concomitantly, in relation to the development of parenchyma, the
several strap-like meristeles, which were originally disposed parallel to the epidermis,
eventually occupy a central position and together acquire an approximately cylindrical
shape. In brief, the co-ordinated structural changes effected during the growth of a lateral
segment are such as tend to produce a figure of equilibrium. The several series of illustrations
presented here show how varied are the changes undergone by the severed meristeles in
the isolated segments. In the distal region of segments in which only a single strap-shaped
meristele is present, the meristele becomes differentiated like a protostele: it has a circular
outline in transverse section and occupies a central position in a segment which is also of
circular outline. In fact, a radially symmetrical structure is produced.

In the older literature the endodermis has usually been held to originate inâ€™a specific
region of the developing shoot, i.e. either in the inner layer of the periblem or the outer
layer of the plerome. It is true that, in the normal development, endodermis occurs with
great regularity in a specific position, i.e. just outside the pericycle. Nevertheless, the
present observations show that endodermis may be formed from incipient vascular tissue
which otherwise would have developed into the several components of the stele. Hence
it would appear that endodermis is not necessarily a tissue of fixed morphological origin

-but rather that it is typically differentiated in a position of interaction between the cortex
and the incipient vascular tissue.
