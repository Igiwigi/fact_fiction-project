Byency of these rapidly elongating corpuscles, different colonies more or less distant
“trom one another may become united.
3 When water or any fluid substance or particles of any foreign body come in contact
a the cells, they at once form plasmodia, and very soon develop vacuoles. These
re at first small, but after a time assume enormous sizes (fig. 37). Very dilute acetic
id, caustic potash, alcohol, quinine, &e., are all capable of producing the vacuolation.

5. Action of the Calomic Corpuscles on Bacteria.

Since Mercunikorr called the attention of biologists to the universal occurrence
in the animal kingdom of cellular ingestion of microbes and certain foreign bodies,
much work has been done to establish the doctrine of phagocytosis. But whilst it
must be at once conceded that the ingestion of microbes is an important fact to be
observed in the struggle between cells and bacteria, yet it is obvious that phago-

cytosis alone constitutes only a link in a more or less obscure series of phenomena.
Tn the case of the coelomic corpuscles it is very easy to demonstrate that all the cells

are not phagocytic. In making this statement, I have specially kept in mind
possibility of a negative chemiotaxis, and have made allowance for what has
called “discrimination in the choice of ingesta.” As already stated, there are in
ccelomic fluid, even normally, great numbers of bacteria which are rarely or never
