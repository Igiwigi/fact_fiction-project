3 for if two sets of values of a, y, z, w satisfy (539), the five quaternions included in
= (540) must be co-planar. Now (540) imposes two conditions on the line pg, and
i therefore represents a congruency of lines; and from the conditions implied in (540)
© we can select but two combinatorial functions with respect to p and g. These are

(f( pp), f (pa) f (ap), F (99)) = 9 (SF (ep), Po) +f gp)f(qq). 7) =0 . (541);

and the congruency is therefore common to two complexes of the fourth and third
orders respectively. But these complexes contain the congruency

Lf (pp), F(p) +f (ap) F@M]=O-. . «©» (542),

and this is foreign to the question, being, in fact, the congruency (496) of Art. 132 of

connectors for the permutable function f( py) +/(qp). When this is rejected, there

remains the congruency of connectors of two pairs of homographs, and its order and

Equations (541) being supposed satisfied, they are equivalent to
