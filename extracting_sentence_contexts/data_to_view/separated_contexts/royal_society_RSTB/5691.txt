For in normal Fibonacci phyllotaxis, such as that of the
Lupin, since three primordia make up a cycle, the gap in which each subsequent
primordium falls is the gap between the next older primordium but one, and the next
older but two, as can readily be seen from fig. 5, A. And within this gap, the new
primordium falls rather closer to the older of the two primordia on each sideâ€”a fact of
which the explanation will become clear below. Normally, therefore, I, would have
fallen in the gap between I, and I;, and on the opposite side of the apex from I, (see
fig. 5, A).
