The sodium was
now heated and the flow of coal-gas stopped. In a short time the reversal of the D lines
was complete. 'The gas was now admitted, and a small quantity only had passed when
the black lines were reduced to threads. In my former communications to the Royal Society I have pointed out the extreme
importance of these facts in connexion with solar and stellar physics. In observing the
swn by the new method, we get various Fraunhofer lines thickened in the 8pots and
thinned in the chromosphere and prominences ; and in these latter, in some instances,
notably in the case of F, we find the lines gradually widening as they approach the limb
of the s8un. While this may be remarked as a solar demonstration of the correctness of the
conclusion at which Dr.
