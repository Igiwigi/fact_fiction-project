p» for the mean squared displacement, (x2(£)) oc t#. When describing the broad ensemble statistics
of random walkers, a constant fractional exponent suffices. For cell biology [5-9], studies of tracer
particles in mammalian cell cytoplasm [10], in cellulo vesicle transport [11-13] and loci in bacteria
[14] were all shown to be well described through a constant fractional exponent. Quantifying
dynamic cellular processes has been a major success for anomalous transport theory and much
scientific work is still ongoing [15-20]. However, current experimental studies [21-23] are finding
evidence of heterogeneous anomalous transport in intracellular processes while the theory for
heterogeneous anomalous transport (specifically when the fractional exponent yz is no longer a
constant) remains largely neglected. In fact, it is given knowledge that the cellular cytoplasm is a
vastly heterogeneous complex fluid [24].

In particular, organelles responsible for cellular metabolism and degradation called lysosomes
move predominantly subdiffusively with heterogeneous fractional exponents that depend on
their spatial positioning [21,25]. This implies that lysosome dynamics should be adequately
described by a fractional diffusion equation with a space-dependent fractional exponent, (x).

More interestingly, lysosomes also maintain a stable non-uniform spatial pattern clustered near : =
the centrosome in the cell [25]. So a challenge for modelling was posed: What is the asymptotic : =
distribution to the space-dependent variable-order fractional diffusion equation [26] and does the 13
experimental distribution of lysosomes match this asymptotic distribution? i=
Recently, we found the asymptotic representation of the solution of the variable-order 8
