system is a more constant feature of the echinoderm nervous system, its variable
constitution in the different classes of the phylum further demonstrates the variable
nature of the motor system generally. The conclusion to be drawn is that while
the functional sensory system is comparable in all groups except the crinoids, the
motor system, both in respect to its apical and hyponeural divisions, exhibits varying
degrees of development and is not strictly comparable throughout the phylum,
It is clear, therefore, that before comparison of the motor system of the various
classes can be attempted, it will be necessary to consider the conditions which
determine motor nerve development.

It has been shown in this account of the nervous system of Marthasterias glacialis
that the motor fibrillae are not restricted to the hyponeural system (Lange’s nerve)
and the apical nerve. ‘The latter represents, in fact, a condensation of the fibrillae
of the lateral motor nerve, which condensation is associated with the innervation of
the apical longitudinal muscle. In the same way, Lange’s nerve must be regarded

as a local centre serving for the innervation of the inferior transverse muscle. The
motor nervous system of Marthasterias glacialis, as far as it can be traced, is, in fact,
developed where it is most required, 7.e., in the neighbourhood of the muscles of the
arm and disk. Comparison of the motor systems should be made with this fact in
mind, and not merely by reference to the hyponeural and apical systems which,
from the evidence provided by the study of Marthasterias glacialis, are only parts of
