Form of the Sporophyll. From the part we have it is evident that a large
number of sporangia were massed together, and not as in Lygodiwm placed
separately, each in an enclosing indusium. From indications of epidermal-like cells
(seen in the drawing at e, text-fig. 2) it appears probable that the arms of tissue A, B,
and © were united by laterally running soft tissue, and that they are, in fact, the
veins of a foliage-like fragment. The character of the cells in a, B, and © supports
this view, for they are considerably elongated, as are the cells over veins. No actual
vascular tissue is recognisable, though there is a very narrow cell in B which
resembles an annular thickened element, but if, as we imagine, the section is cut
tangentially to the surface of the veins, it may well be that it escaped their tracheids
just as it has escaped the connecting lamina.
