three ensemble members of the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model MPI-ESM in its low-
resolution set-up MPI-ESM-LR that were submitted to the CMIP5 archive [12]: for the same
model and the same external forcing, one of these simulations projected an increase in Arctic
sea ice over the period 1979-2012, while another simulation resulted in a decrease of Arctic sea
ice similar to the one observed (figure 3). The fact that one simulation resulted in an increase in
Arctic sea ice does not tell us anything about the capability of this model to realistically capture
the processes that determine the future evolution of Arctic sea ice: despite a stark disagreement
between this simulation and the observed sea-ice evolution, the model might well be very useful
for our purposes, as reflected by the fact that another simulation with the same models matches
the available observations quite well. This is simply a reflection of the fact that reality just realized
a single trajectory of the infinite number of possible trajectories that are allowed for any given
external forcing to the system.

The simple example depicted in figure 3 indicates how important it is to reasonably take
internal variability into account for any attempt to reject a specific model for any purpose that
is affected by internal variability. This hence usually affects all applications of climate model
simulations that span time scales on which internal variability of the specific observable becomes
