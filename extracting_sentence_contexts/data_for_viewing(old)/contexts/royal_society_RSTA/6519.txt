in Joyce. For example, does it refer to something like a classical-like ultimate reality, say, that of

the chaos-theoretical type, or quantum-like, RWR-type ultimate reality? As I have argued from a
the outset, these are two very different ways of mixing chaos and order, and these not the only :
such ways, especially if one moves beyond scientific ways of this mixing, which Joyce surely
contemplated and staged in his text. The novel does say, undoubtedly referring to its own project,
making the ‘I’ in the sentence that of Joyce: ‘I am working out a quantum theory about it for it is
really most tantumising [a play on tantalizing] state of affairs’ [46] (p. 149). At the surface level,
the shift from ‘tantalizing’ to ‘tantumising’ may be seen in terms of Shannon information, but only
at the surface level, for it still involves a play of qualia. But, apart from the fact that this sentence
alone does not tell us how the novel configures thus quantum theory, the ‘quantum theory’
