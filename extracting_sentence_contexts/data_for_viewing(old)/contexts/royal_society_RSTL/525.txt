tain the causes, and to explain the various cases, of horizontal
refraction, which I had either observed myself, or had seen
described by others. .

At the time of writing that essay, I had not met with the
Memoires sur Ãž Egypte, published but a short time before; and
I was not aware that an account had been given by M. Moxce,
of the phenomenon known to the French by the name of
mirage, Which their army had daily opportunities of seeing, in
their march through the deserts of Egypt.

In the perusal of this memoir, I could not fail - to derive
instruction-from the information it contained ; but, as the facts
related by him accord entirely with the theory that I had
advanced, I was by no means induced to adopt the explanation
that he has proposed, in preference to my own.

2 Dr. WorLasToN's Observations on horizontal Refraction ;

The definite reflecting surface which he supposes to take
place between two strata of air of different density, is by no
means consistent with that continued ascent. of rarefied air
