the evidence being already in fayour of the hypothesis that the pasxage of contrac-
tile waves depends on the presence of certain differentiated elements whose function is
presumably nervous, such evidence would be further strengthened if it could be shown
that in the very same tissue there occur other differentiated elements whose function is
demonstrably nervous. Now that such elements as the las; mentioned do occur in all
parts of the excitable tissues of Aurelia aurits is a fact concerning which there can be
no question.

(5) If any part of the polypite of Awrela be stimulated, the natural rhythm becomes
accelerated and the systoles more powerful. Again, if any part of the irritable surface
of the swimming-bell be stimulated, not only do the swimming-motions become more
rapid and powerful, but the lobes of the polypite writhe about in answer to the stimu-
lation. These complementary facts clearly prove the occurrence of reflex action between
the polypite and the swimming-bell reciprocally. Similarly, if seven lithocysts be
removed, and the remaining one be of a somewhat weakly character, 80 as not to inter-
fere with the observation by its excessive spontaneity, it may often be observed that if
a portion of the irritable surface of the swimming-bell be submitted to a stimulus of
sÂ£omewhat less than minimal intensity as regards the starting of a contractile wave
from the point of stimulation, a contractile wave will nevertheless start from the single
remaining lithocyst s0 s00n as time has been allowed for the stimulus to travel from
the point of its application to that of the lithocyst. The greater the distance between
these two points, the less certain is the experiment to succeed ; but in many specimens
it may 8ucceed every time, even though the stimulus be applied at the opposite side of
the swimming-bell from that in which the lithocyst is placed. In such cases, however,
it is very important to observe that stimulation of certain tracts of tissue is followed
