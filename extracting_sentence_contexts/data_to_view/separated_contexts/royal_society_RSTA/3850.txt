Those who were in ships off the island saw a flash of fire,
followed by loud crashing noises. The eruption was sudden in its outburst, and
lasted only for a day or two. These are, in fact, the distinctive features of the eruptions of 1812 and 1902, as
observed by those at some distance from the voleano, and the whole account resembles
in many respects very closely some of the narratives which were published in the
spring of this year. If Drror was able so exactly to predict the circumstances
of future eruptions of the Soufri√©re, he must have had even more of the creative spirit
of imagination than he has hitherto been credited with. Humpotpt made several references to this eruption, though it is not exactly
known from what sources he drew his information.
