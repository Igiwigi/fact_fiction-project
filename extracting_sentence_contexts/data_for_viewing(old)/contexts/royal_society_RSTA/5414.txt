models, including three-dimensional ocean models with prescribed freshwater
flux and restoring conditions to surface temperature [70], and three-dimensional
models coupled to a simple atmosphere [71,72]. Sakai & Peltier [73] proposed that
millennial deep-decoupling oscillations could explain Dansgaard—Oeschger events.
Colin de Verdiére et al. [33,74,75] complement this early proposal with a fairly
complete theory based on ocean circulation model experiments. The oscillations
described by Colin de Verdiére et al. involve the processes of turbulent vertical
mixing (neglected in Winton & Sarachik [68]), advection and convection, which
unify the salt oscillator with the deep-decoupling oscillation model. Incidentally,
Colin de Verdiére et al. [74] dismiss the nonlinearity of the equation of state as
he cause of the oscillations.

There is, across the model hierarchy, consistency about the fact that the
ransition between the oscillating circulation regime and the so-called diffusive,
1aline regime (without deep convection) is associated with a homoclinic
oifurcation [33,76]. The nature of the bifurcation between the convective regime
and the oscillation is more model-dependent. Timmermann et al. [76], based on
experiments with the eight-ocean box Gildor-Tziperman model, find a Hopf
vifurcation; salt-conserving experiments with a two-dimensional ocean model
show a transition towards a finite-period cycle, but of increasing period as the
oifurcation is approached; experiments with a more idealized model, formulated
as a two-equation dynamical system, reveal the signature of an infinite-period
vifurcation [33].? The latter implies that Dansgaard—Oeschger events, at the
ime when they appear soon after the glacial inception process, should be very
ong but of a similar amplitude to the Dansgaard—Oeschger events coming later
