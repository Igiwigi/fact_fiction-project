upon the raw materials of the animal fabric, such, perhaps, as
the albumen of eggs, and the blood. But, until by synthetical
experiments the peculiar substances of animals are composed
from what are considered to be elementary materials, or the
changes of organic secretion imitated by art, it cannot be hoped
that any determinate knowledge should be establighed upon:
which the physiology of muscles may be explained. Such
researches and investigations promise, however, the most pro-
bable ultimate success, since the phenomena are nearest allied
to those of chemistry, and since all other hypotheses have, in
their turns, proved unsatisfactory.

Facts and Experiments tending to swpport and illustrate the pre-
ceding Argument.

An emaciated horse was killed by dividing the medullaspinalis,
and the large blood-vessels under the first bone of the sternum.
