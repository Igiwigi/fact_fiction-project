The IGHV gene rearrangement
frequencies are included in tables 1 and 2, the IGHD frequen-
cies are shown in table 3, and the IGH]J frequencies are shown
in table 4. The average lengths of IGHD genes within the VDJ
rearrangements were also determined, and are included in
table 3. Calculation of the average length of each gene
within VDJ rearrangements is complicated by the fact that
some rearrangements include very short IGHD genes. It is
impossible to be confident of any alignment of a human
IGHD gene that is shorter than 8 nt [34], and alignments of 8
or more nucleotides were therefore used to gauge the extent
of exonuclease activity within the mouse. Such IGHD align-
ments were seen in 63.2% of BALB/c and 62.7% of C57BL/6
VDJ.
