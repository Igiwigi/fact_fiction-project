It is worthy
of remark, that the whole of these structures are formed in the ovisac, in which, as
before shown, only one egg is secreted at the same time, and is then passed, com-
plete in all its parts, into the oviduct, to be impregnated preparatory to the produc-
tion of the new being.

3. Deposition of the Ova, and Habits of the Species. I have never yet seen the Iulidz in coitu, but from the fact that the oviduct in the
female, at the season of depositing her eggs, is always completely filled with them, all
equally developed, as well as from the entire absence of a spermatheca, we may rea-

sonably conclude that the act is of short duration, and that oviposition takes place
very s00n after impregnation. From the circumstance that many eggs are far ad-
vanced when the animals are collected in the autumn, I at first supposed that season
to be the proper period for depositing the eggs ; but the facts now about to be stated
induce me to believe that this process takes place very early in the spring. In order to observe the habits of these animals, I collected from thirty to forty of
them in the beginning of October, when they were preparing to hybernate, and
placed them in a tin box, covered at the bottom with clay and sand mixed with vege-
table mould, the soil in which they were captured.
