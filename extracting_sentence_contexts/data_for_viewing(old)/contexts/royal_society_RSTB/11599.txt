of prestigious /innovative projects’ as the outcome. The multilevel
linear model had empty random-effects equations, meaning that
_ (is project prestigious?) +1 (2.1) the single-level linear model with no project team effects was a

(number of individuals in project) ° : better fit for the data than the multilevel model. In other words,
there was no nesting by the project team. Similarly, the multilevel
Poisson model was not a better fit for the data than the single-level
model with no project team effects. Therefore, I examined the
extent to which network structure and spatial layout were associ-
ated with membership in prestigious and innovative project teams
using Heckman sample selection regression models, and did sen-
sitivity analysis using the multilevel mixed effects Poisson models.
I ran the Heckman model to account for the fact that the theoretical
framework (figure 1) assumes that in interacting and collaborating
individuals identify expertise in others and form perceptions on
the prestige of project teams through social cognition. Spatial cog-
nition plays a role in how individuals navigate the physical space
of the organization, which is related to the formation and mainten-
ance of social ties and networks. Thus, the correlation between
network structure and prestige outcomes is contingent on the
association between spatial cognition and social networks. The
Heckman sample selection model consists of two equations: a
probit selection equation to model the likelihood that an individual
will have a higher than median degree (centrality in the network
based on number of ties), and, contingent on this, a linear outcome
