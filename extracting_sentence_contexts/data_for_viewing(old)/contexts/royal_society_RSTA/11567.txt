52 MR. O. W. RICHARDSON ON THE IONISATION

about nine-tenths of the hydrogen originally present in it at the end of the
experiment, so that the experiment appears to warrant the conclusion that the
amount of the negative ionisation depends very little on the amount of hydrogen in
the wire. In fact, the hydrogen appears to act by altering the condition of the
surface of the wire, and once this change has taken place it is very little affected by
changes in the amount of hydrogen either outside or inside. The most reasonable
view appears to be to suppose that the positively charged hydrogen atoms form an
electrical double layer, which helps the corpuscles out of the metal.

A few measurements of the variations of the ionisation, both positive and negative,
with the temperature were made in hydrogen. Experiments at pressures of the
order of 1 millim. were found to be particularly difficult to carry out on account of
the length of time required for equilibrium to be established and the difficulty
of being certain that it was established. The following values, with a pressure of
1:90 millims, represent the best series of measurements at this kind of pressure.
