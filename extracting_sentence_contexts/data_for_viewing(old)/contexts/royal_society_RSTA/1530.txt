two-dimensional fluorescence Hessian SIM [21]. The optical path diagram is shown in figure 1b.
The dual-mode uses the same detection objective lens to image the same cell at the same location.
ODT can acquire the three-dimensional RI distributions of the entire cell in these two modes,
which reveal organelles with different refractive indices, such as lipid droplets, mitochondria
and lysosomes [21]. Therefore, even in samples such as live cells, it is expected that organelles
with different RI may scatter and distort the incident light, which causes reconstruction artefacts.
Meanwhile, since light scattering is closely related to the RI distribution of the sample, we
can calculate the scattering and distortion of the SIM incident light using the RI yielded by
the ODT.
