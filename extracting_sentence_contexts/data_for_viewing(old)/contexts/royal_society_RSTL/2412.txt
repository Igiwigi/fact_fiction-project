at & I, it will, by the increase of decomposition within, show how much greater the
intensity is there than at the former points. The connexions of P and N with the
voltaic battery are of course to be continued during the whole time.

726. A third form of experiment in which difference of intensity was obtained, for
the purpose of testing the principle of equal chemical action, was to arrange three
vyolta-electrometers, 80 that after the electric current had passed through one, it
should divide into two parts, which, after traversing each one of the remaining in-
struments, should reunite. The sum of the decomposition in the two latter yessels was
always equal to the decompoxsition in the former vessel. But the intensity of the di-
vided current could not be the-same as that it had in its original state ; and therefore
variation of intensity has no influence on the results if the quantity of electricity remain
the same, The experiment, in fact, resolves itself simply into an increase in the 8ize
of the electrodes (725.).

727. The third point, in respect to which the principle of equal electro-chemical
action on water was tested, was variation of the strength of the solution used. In order
to render the water a conductor, sulphuric acid had been added to it (707.); and it
did not seem unlikely that this substance, with many others, might render the water
more $ubject to decomposition, the electricity remaining the same in quantity. But
such did not prove to be the case. Diluted sulphuric acid, of different strengths, was
introduced into different decomposing apparatus, and submitted simultaneously to

the action of the same electric current (714.). Slight differences occurred, as before,
sometimes in one direction, sometimes in another; but the final result was, that
