in No. 1 I,a arose before I, and was not joined to it, and in No. 5 I,a, though joined to
I,, was at a slightly lower level (see fig. 5) and had therefore arisen before I,. In No. 4
I,a arose at nearly the same time as I,, as in the previous experiments. Now in the
present three experiments it was recorded that P, was young at the time of operation,

so that I, also must have been young. This fact is significant, for the results resemble
those of another series of eight experiments in which similar operations were performed
on the presumptive area of I,. These experiments will not be described in detail, but
it may be mentioned that in all of them a complete leaf developed on the anodic side of

while in all of them its other stipule lay beneath the stipule of I,.
