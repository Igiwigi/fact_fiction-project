isolating at its extremity, and it was necessary to excite it by friction in order to renew
the experiment. This circumstance is probably attributable to the formation of a thin
film of oxide. The point and plate of copper gave out a luminous are of a beautiful
green light, which contrasted in a remarkable manner with the blue reflexion
visible in this, as in the other experiments. Mercury was likewise employed, both
as a positive and negative electrode. In a vacuum as well as in atmospheric air,
the luminous effect was most brilliant. The mercury was excessively agitated, rising
up in the form of a cone when it was positive, and sinking considerably below the
positive point when it was negative. The quantity of vapour thrown off by the mer-
cury during this experiment filled the bell so quickly that it was not easy to observe
the details.

I $hall terminate this section by stating a fact which appears to me to be import-
ant ; it is the influence which the nature of the metallic points forming the electrodes
exercises on the temperature which they acquire in relation to the production of the
voltaic are. If the two points are of the same metal, both platinum, or both silver,
the positive one alone becomes incandescent throughout its whole length. If the
Silver point be positive and that of the platinum negatiye, the latter becomes incan-
descent, and the silver one is much less heated. 'Thus, when the voltaic arc is formed,
the circuit must be regarded as completed, and then it is those parts of the circuit
which present the greatest resistance to the current which become the hottest ; at
first it is that portion forming the arc itself, and then, in the rest of the circuit, the
metal which is the worst conductor. But if the conductors be of the same material
on both sides of the arc, or if there be only a slight difference of conductibility be-
tween them, then the development of heat, instead of being uniform, as it might ap-
