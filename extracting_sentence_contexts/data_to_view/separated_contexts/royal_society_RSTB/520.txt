peas when everything was sterilised, or when the sand was not seeded by the soil-

extract, the negative result with the lupins when their soils were not seeded, or when
they were seeded with the same extract as the peas, and the positive result when
seeded with the extract from the sandy soil where lupins were growing, seem to
exclude any other conclusion than that the micro-organisms supplied by the soil
extracts were essential agents in the process of fixation. Further, the development
