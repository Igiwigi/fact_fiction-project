arisen from some error
committed in making the experiment. Happily for the progress of science, the matter was. again
taken up, about twenty years ago, by Professor PicTET; and
the interesting fact, which the Florentine academicians would not
discover, was put beyond all doubt. But till, this ingenious and
enlightened philosopher did not consider the appearances of a
reflection of cold, which he observed in his experiments, as
being real ; nor was he led by them to admit the existence of
frigorific emanations from cold bodies, analogous to those calo-
rific emanations from hot bodies, which he calls radiant heat. He every where speaks of the reflection of cold (by metallic
mirrors) as being merely apparent ; and it is on that supposition,
that the explanation he has given of the phenomena is founded.
