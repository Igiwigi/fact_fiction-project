to a time scale half that for the remaining steam curves.)

loaded with a suitable small weight, placed in a steam chamber or a vessel containing
the caustic soda solution, and its extension followed by means of a travelling microscope.
Whatever the load, and therefore whatever the rate of extension, since the only
difference between the various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded
fibres stretch more quickly, the limiting extension at rupture was always roughly the
same. (The fibre which gave the curve marked (a) broke at an extension just over
80% ; this was probably due to some irregularity in diameter, aggravated by incipient
decomposition during the prolonged time (1500 minutes) for which it was necessary
to keep the fibre in the steam chamber under the small load used on this occasion.)
The wool fibre which gave the curve (b) extended as far as 104% in 90 minutes without
breaking.

The changes brought about in the load/extension curve of hair by steam or water at
higher temperatures are for the most part permanent ; the curve which is character-
istic of the normal fibre in water at ordinary temperatures, and which leads to rupture
at extensions between about 50%, and 70%,,* can never be recovered by any subsequent
