mode of generation of the fresh water muscle and oyster ;

of the pullet, the frog, the earth worm and barnacle. But
as it will require another season to complete this investiga-
tion, I am desirous of preceding it with an account of the
formation of pearls ; the discovery of which was made in the

fresh water muscle.

new facts respecting pearls at this moment, when the public
mind is directed to the improvement of the pearl fishery, and
