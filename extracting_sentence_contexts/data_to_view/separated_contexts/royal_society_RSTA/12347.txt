This
calculation showed that for a P.D. of 3000 volts between the needle and the quadrants,
the amount of such attraction was quite unable to account for the observed diminution
of sensibility with large charges in the needle. Dr. HopKiyson says in his paper,
“Increased tension of the fibres from electrical attraction does not therefore account
for the whole of the facts, although it does play the principal part.” The experiments
that we made at the end of 1886 and beginning of 1887, confirmed by the calculation
above referred to, proved that, at any rate in our specimen of the quadrant electro-
meter, the principal part of the anomalous action was not caused by an increased
tension of the fibres, and that, therefore, some other cause must be looked for to
explain the observed results. The following investigation was, therefore, undertaken
to ascertain the cause, and the means of removing it, and we are happy to say that it

* We do not know whether the weight, with the fine wire attached, supplied us by Messrs. Waite is
exactly the same as is supplied generally by them with the quadrant electrometer, if so the users must
experience a very unnecessary difficulty from the Blackburn-pendulum-like vibration of the needle.
