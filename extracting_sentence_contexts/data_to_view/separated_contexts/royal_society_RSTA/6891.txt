It is remarkable that this
idea of representation in closed circles should, in this subject, have received more attention
than the more natural concepts of representation in open circles and at the origin. If we take, as base for H(1/r), the Taylor base {z"}, we see from § 3 that the biorthogonal
set is again the Taylor base {z"} in H(r). Theorem 2-1 states the well-known fact that every
f¢H(r) is represented absolutely by its Taylor series in some D,(r). From theorem 2-2
we obtain:

Turorem 4-1. Let {p,(z)} be any sequence of functions in H(r) such that every fe H(p) (for a

given p>r) is represented in some D,(r) by a series of the form + Cy b,(Z).
