almost coincides, and at high temperatures it actually coincides, with the curve of its
higher homologue, methyl isobutyrate. It is more than likely that the large viscosity-
coefficients of the formates are associated with the fact, previously established, that
of the five lowest fatty acids, formic acid has, at low temperatures, the largest
coefficients, and that these coefficients are larger than they might be expected to be
even on making allowance for molecular aggregation.

On comparing the isomeric propionates and acetates, it is seen that although the
curve for ethyl acetate is very slightly to the left of that for methyl propionate, the
curve for propyl acetate is far to the right of that for ethyl propionate. This is
the result of the influence exerted by the symmetry of the molecule in lowering
the viscosity. In the first case the acetate is a symmetrical compound and the
propionate is unsymmetrical ; in the second case both compounds are unsymmetrical.
In conformity with the general rule, the curve for methyl isobutyrate lies well to the
