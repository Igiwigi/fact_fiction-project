terrace can be separated by mapping from another or from the Dunsmore gravels, and
such distinction has to be made on considerations of height. Fortunately, No. 4 terrace,
even as far upstream as Rugby, is still clearly below the Dunsmore gravels. On con-
siderations of height alone, however, there could be confusion with the Baginton-Lillington
gravels, and it is fortunate that the pebble content of these (whether they be the pure
Bunter type of Baginton or the Bunter-Jurassic development of Lillington) immediately
allows separation from the flint-rich terraces. Only the River Sherbourne, flowing from
the north-west, lacks flint in its poorly developed terraces, and in this respect resembles
the River Tame to the west of the Warwickshire coalfield.

Perhaps the most striking feature of the system of terraces is that their height distribution
is completely at variance with that of the Older Drifts. This arises from the fact (which will
be amplified later) that the Older Drifts fill a pre-glacial valley which slopes down to the
north-east, whereas all the terraces conform with the present Avon in falling in level to the
south-west. This has the effect that the long profile of a terrace such as No. 4 crosses the
plane of the base of the Older Drifts. In the Lower Avon mapped by Dr Tomlinson, No. 4
terrace is scores of feet below the older series, and even at Warwick its top is 40 ft. below
the base of the Baginton-Lillington gravels. Upstream from here it approaches towards
the older series and first rests on the Baginton-Lillington gravels at Baginton on the Sowe
and near Willenhall on the Avon; from these points it creeps progressively over the sub-
divisions of the Older Drifts and near Coombe and Rugby is banked against the Wolston
clay. One may guess that, near the source of the Avon, No. 4 terrace will grade into the
Dunsmore gravels or the Chalky Boulder Clay, from which it derived its material by
erosion.
