246 Mr. HENNELL on the mutual action of

While preparing some of the sulphovinates, I was struck
with the very great change produced in sulphuric acid by
mere mixture with alcohol.

440 grains of sulphuric acid were mixed with an equal
weight of alcohol of specific gravity ,820 ; the mixture when
cold was diluted with water and saturated by carbonate of
s0da, partially dried, of which it required for saturation g98
grains, while 440 grains of sulphuric acid not mixed with
alcohol saturated 555 grains of the same- carbonate of soda,
$0 that Z of the acid had been saturated by the alcohol.

440 grains of sulphuric acid mixed with its own weight
of alcohol, as before, and then poured into a solution of ace-
tate of lead, 542 grains of sulphate were precipitated. The
same quantity of sulphuric acid unchanged by alcohol gave
2313 grains of sulphate of lead; thus 4 of the sulphuric
acid had lost its power of precipitating oxide of lead from its
Solutions ; it had in fact been converted into sulphovinic acid. M. Voctr, who has particularly described some of these
salts, and I believe also M.
