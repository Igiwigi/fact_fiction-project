The
dissipative forces are therefore not powerful enough in smoothing out the microseisms
when there is a marked difference in the wind velocity lasting for 1 or 2 days or more over
the different parts of the sea, and the conclusion is, therefore, irresistible from the observed
microseisms that unless a depression or a storm has formed there is not much difference
in the mean wind velocity over the main parts of the sea, and even if there is any it
does not last long to be effective in producing waves of different periods, a conclusion
which is also supported by the uniform configuration of the normal isobars* during
the monsoon months. A variation in the amplitude of the microseisms will, however, be caused by a slow
variation in the velocity of the wind prevailing over the sea areas. In fact, it will be
shown later in this paper that the amplitude of the long-period microseisms, which are
caused by waves over the shallow sea near the coast during pronounced land and sei
breezes, undergoes a diurnal variation analogous to that of the wind. A case involving superposition of waves of different periods which calls for special
treatment is that of microseisms associated with storms in the Bay of Bengal and the
Arabian Sea. In these storms, the wind velocity in the storm area will differ widely
from that in the surrounding regions.
