may easily happen, there has in these cases been a post-mortem infiltration of the
active material into the anterior from the posterior lobe.

That the activity of the extract so far as the heart and blood-vessels are concerned
is confined to the posterior lobe was determined by Howett; our results, as will
be seen, extend these observations to the diuretic effect. This is the more
remarkable, because the anterior lobe is very obviously of glandular structure, being
composed of masses of epithelial cells which here and there surround a lumen or
line a cyst-like cavity, and which have numerous large sinus-like blood-vessels
ramifying amongst them. The posterior lobe, on the other hand, is composed mainly
of a tissue which resembles nerve grey matter, with many glia cells and, according
to some authorities, a few nerve fibres and some scattered nerve cells; it consists,
in fact, to all appearance of neuroglia with, perhaps, some nerve tissue, as the mode
of its formation from the floor of the third ventricle might lead one to expect.
There is, however, a layer of vascular epithelial tissue covering the part of the lobe
where it abuts on the intraglandular cleft before noticed, the more superficial cells
being arranged somewhat like the cells of a columnar epithelium. This epithelial
layer passes at the edges of the intraglandular cleft into continuity with the
epithelial tissue of the anterior lobe—of which, in fact, it appears to be an extension ;
it probably belongs to the hypophysial part of the gland, and the intraglandular
cleft—which is not present in all animals—is also wholly hypophysial.* The
cleft itself is occupied by a small amount of glairy fluid,} which is probably secreted
by the cells which bound the cleft. It is difficult to determine whether there is
any difference in activity of an extract made from the anterior layer of the posterior
lobe, which includes this epithelial structure, and from the middle and the posterior
