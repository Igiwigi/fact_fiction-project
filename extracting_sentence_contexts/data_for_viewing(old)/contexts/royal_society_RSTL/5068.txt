242 MAGNETIC SURVEY IN NORTH AMERICA.

of the United States, (Commissioner for exploring the North-Eastern Boundary of the
United States under the act of Congress of July 20th, 1840, Principal Astronomer
and Head of the Scientific Corps on the part of the Government of the United States
for the joint survey and demarcation of the Boundary under the Treaty of Wash-
ington,) for the results of observations of the Inclination made from 1841 to 1845
at thirty-eight stations, chiefly in the parts of the country in which the Boundary
Commissioners have been engaged. These observations were made with an incli-
nometer by GamBEgy, with the exception of three stations, where an instrument of
TroUGuToON and Simms was employed*; they appear to have been made with extreme
care, and the results are remarkably accordant and satisfactory. Major Granam's
observations have a particular value, in placing beyond question the fact that the
direction of the isoclinal lines in that part of the American Continent is to the north-
ward of east, whilst in the whole range of country elsewhere comprehended in this
survey, these lines have a direction more or less from the northward of west to the
southward of east : the geographical position in which certain of the isoclinal lines
attain their greatest southing is thus satisfactorily ascertained. Major GRanam states
that the results now communicated are abstracted from a paper which has been pre-
sented to the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and which will be here-
after published in the Transactions of that Society.

From Dr. Locks of Cincinnati I have received the result of a very extensive series
of observations of the Inclination and Force, on which he has been engaged for eight
years (1838 to 1845 inclusive), comprehending the determination of both elements at
