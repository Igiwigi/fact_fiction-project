The arrival of CV larvae disrupted
of the two species were observed. We consider that these established LS aggregate, but failed to attract the whole
findings partially contradict our third hypothesis and can group. In fact, it looks like larvae took different decisions:
be explained by collective decision processes. some favoured thermal optimization, others aggregation
Here, larvae had the choice between accelerating their and many sited in-between. In the other half of replicates,

metabolism through thermal optimization (i.e. relocation) or larvae choose aggregation and formed a single and dense
aggregate in larger groups to locally liquefy food for better interspecific group. However, the choice of this group for a
and faster assimilation (ie. perturbation).
