The numbers in these two groups are, to within the limits of the error of experiment,
constant. Accordingly we may assume that if v, v', and v” are the volumes at the same tem-
perature of quantities of the solutions, the volume of each of which at 0? C. is unity, the

Secondly, noticing that the numbers in each of the above groups are approximately
-equal to each other and to unity, and bearing in mind the fact that the differences
