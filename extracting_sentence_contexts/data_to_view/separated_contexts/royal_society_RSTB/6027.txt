But
structural features of this wall, such as the pits on radial walls and the trabecule,
or bars of cellulose, which sometimes traverse the space of a tracheid from one
tangential wall to the other, are extraordinarily constant in position. The pits are
always on radial walls, their borders never overlapping the tangential walls, whilst
the trabecule run in a very straight radial line through a radial file of tracheids. These facts are contrary to a method of growth of the wall which involves a continua!
spiral displacement of its substance. The only alternative method whereby a cell can increase in length with no
alteration in girth is that indicated in fig. 8. The inclination of the fibril alters so

as to accommodate the increased length of A B.
