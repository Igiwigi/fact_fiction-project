Figure 6. The right parts of the probability distributions of X = In |q,| and insets for the whole distributions for inverse (a =
0,1/4) and direct (a = 3/4, 1) cascades. The left slope —2 is due to a simple fact that the moments (|a|?) = (exp(qX))
diverge for g < —2. The distributions collapse to the large-deviation form away from the pumping. (Online version in colour.)

lognormal distribution of stone sizes [34]. Applying this to fluid turbulence [3] leads to
unphysical results, as was noticed by Frisch [1]. Indeed, a lognormal distribution leads to negative
¢q for sufficiently large q, which does not make sense. In addition, if the multipliers were
statistically independent, one would compute In P(X) = —kH(X/k) or ¢q proceeding from P(c)
by a standard large-deviation formalism: H(y) = min,[zy — Go(z)], where Go(z) = In J do e”? P(o).
Such derivation would express (|a,|7) via (e7°*), which is impossible since the former moments
exist for all q, while the latter do not because of the exponential tails of P(a), see also [12,13].
Therefore, to describe properly the scaling of the amplitudes, one needs to account for the
correlations between multipliers. Physically, it is quite natural that the rule how the distribution
changes along the cascade must be encoded in the correlations between the steps of the cascade.
