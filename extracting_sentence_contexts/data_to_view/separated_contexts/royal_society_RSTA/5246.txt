The paper
was not published, as I hoped to be able to obtain evidence of a more definite character, ‘seh as that

which is now adduced in Articles 7 and 8 of this paper, which shows that the equations are incomplete,

except for steady motion, and that to render them integrable from rest the terms of higher orders must
be retained, and thus contirms the argument I advane e

ed, and completely explains the anomaly. FLUIDS AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE CRITERION. 153

The fact that these conditions are realized, under certain circumstances, has afforded
the only means of verifying the truth of the assumptions as to the boundary con-
ditions, that there shall be no slipping, and as to » being independent of the
variations of mean-motion. Verification of the Assumptions in the Equation of Viscous Fluid.

28. As applied to the conditions of PoisruiLtn’s experiments and similar experi-
Aents made since, the results obtained from the theory are found to agree throughout
e entire range so long as w’, ’, w’ are zero, showing that if there were any slipping
must have been less than the thousandth part of the mean flow, although the
wential force at the boundary was 0°2 gr.
