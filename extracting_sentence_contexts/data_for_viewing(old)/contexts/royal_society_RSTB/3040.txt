We do not propose, however, to enter into a thorough discussion of the
phenomenon of periodicity; but to consider more particularly the disturbing effect
of periodicity on the results of any given stimulus. The nature of this effect may be
readily imagined, and the effect itself not infrequently makes itself felt. One
example must suffice. Under certain conditions of illumination, pigment contraction
takes place. The experiment runs on, night falls, contraction persists. In the
morning a temporary expansion occurs, which soon gives place to a re-contraction.
It is generally easy to allow for complications of this sort by performing experiments
at various times of the day, and by comparing the results; but negative results
become very troublesome ; an element of uncertainty attaches, for example, to many
of our experiments on the effect of monochromatic light, owing to the fact that
failure to produce a pigment movement does not necessarily mean failure to effect a
stimulation of that pigment. j

C, The Chief Colour-phases induced by various Light-conditions.

Certain conditions of illumination call forth definite pigment movements, which
result in the production of well-marked colour-phases in Hippolyte, Macromysis,
and Palamon. These we now describe, not only on account of their intrinsic
interest, but also because they serve as useful starting-points for further
experiment. In the case of Palemon, they have been previously described by
Poucnert (1876).
