This amount therefore, for any particular unit of time, is a certain fixed
proportion of the total quantity undergoing change. If, now, the system of com-
pensation be 80 far disturbed as that while other conditions remain the same the quan-
tity of substance be allowed to diminish, it seems probable that the total amount of
change occurring at any moment will be proportional to the quantity of substance then
remaining. :

Adopting this hypothesis, the law of connexion between the quantity of substance
remaining at any time, and the time during which the change has proceeded, may be
found in the following way :â€”

Let y represent the amount of substance remaining after the change has proceeded
for a time w, and let, dy be the diminution of the substance during an infinitesimal time

dz, then Z represents the amount of 8ubstance which disappears in a unit of time; and

this amount is by the hypothesis proportional to the quantity of substance remaining ; 80
that we have the equation

dy

Fn
which gives

y=ae,

where @ is the quantity of substance at the commencement of the change. This equation expresses the fact that the quantities of substance remaining after a
series of interyals of time increasing in arithmetical progression, form a series in geome-
trical progression. After the intervals 0, 1, 2, 3, ... minutes, the quantities of substance
remaining are

a geometric series of which the ratio is 6%. The curve which expresses this relation
between & and y is a logarithmic curve.
