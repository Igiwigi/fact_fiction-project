This may, in part, be accounted for by the comparative scarcity of
conodonts in the Pen-y-garnedd Limestone. More extensive collecting, and the applica-
tion of statistical methods may modify this apparent discrepancy. The fact that individual conodont species most probably represent components of a
compound jaw apparatus (Scott 1934, 1942; DuBois 1943; Rhodes 1952), should not,
however, be overlooked, for it may provide an explanation of the relative abundance of
these species. This problem can only be solved by the collection of complete conodont
assemblages, and this is impossible when the present method of extraction (p. 268) is
employed. The present study indicates the degree of similarity which may be expected between
the conodont faunas of formations of a broadly similar age.
