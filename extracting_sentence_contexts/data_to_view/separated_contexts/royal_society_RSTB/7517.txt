The circle of Willis

Apart from the fact that the circle of Willis receives part of its blood supply from the
internal carotid arteries and from the occipital arteries via the basi-sphenoidal plexus, the
vessels related to the circle are essentially similar to those seen in the sheep and the goat. The basilar artery is again a relatively insignificant vessel, diminishing in calibre caudally
(figure 29). PIG, Sus scrofa
(Figures 5; 31, 32, plate 18; 33, plate 19)

In the pig the carotid rete is situated intracranially within the cavernous sinus, but it
lies more posteriorly than in the other artiodactyls.
