As the electroweak generalization of the Dirac monopole, this monopole should exist if the
standard model is correct. This means that the true final test of the standard model should come
from the discovery of the electroweak monopole, not the Higgs particle [13-15]. In fact, since the
electroweak monopole comes from the non-trivial topology of the standard model, the discovery
of this monopole must be viewed as the topological test of the standard model. An important issue in the electroweak monopole is its mass, which is a crucial piece of
information for us to discover the monopole. We could not predict the mass of the Dirac
monopole, which has made the experimental detection of the monopole a blind search in a
dark room [21].
