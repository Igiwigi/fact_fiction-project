states, on the authority of KLEINENBERG, that in 8ome of the apparently delaminate
types the segmentation is unequal, which © probably indicates an epibolic gastrula.” While the occurrence of epibolic gastrulz among these forms is by no means improbable,
it eannot be accepted on this evidence alone ; for the segmentation of Renilla shows that
such an inference may be entirely false. It is a curious fact that in two at least of the invaginate forms, viz. : Acting equind
(JourDAN), and Cerianthus (KOwALEVSKY), a yolk-mass is formed in the gastric
cavity some time after the invagination has occurred, though no traces of it exisb in *
earlier 8tages.
