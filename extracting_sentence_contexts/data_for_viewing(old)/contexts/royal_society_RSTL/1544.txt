matter : for had we no where an instance of any alteration in
the appearance of nebulz, they might be looked upon as per-
manent celestial bodies, and the successive changes, to which
by the action of an attracting principle they have been con-
ceived to be subject, might be rejected as being unsupported.
by observation.

The various appearances of this nebula are $0 instructive,
that I shall apply them to the subject of the partial opacity of.
the nebulous matter, which has already been inferred from its
planetary appearance, when extremely condensed in globular
masses ; but which now may be supported by more direct
arguments. For when I formerly saw three fictitious nebulous,
Stars, it will not be contended that there were three small
$hining nebulosities, just in the three lines in which I saw them,.
of which two are now gone and only one remaining. As well.
might we ascribe the light surrounding a star, which is seen
through a mist, to a quality of shining belonging to that
particular part of the mist, which by chance happened to be
situated where the star is seen. If then the former nebulosity-
of the two stars which have ceased to be nebulous can only be
ascribed to an effect of the transit or penetration of their light
through nebulous matter which deflected and scattered it, we
have now a direct proof that this matter can exist in a state of.
