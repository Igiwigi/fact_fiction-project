the proximate killers of life. The earlier tension between impact and volcanism models has
simplified, with a realization that asteroid impact might have been a prime driver only of the
mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, 66 Myr ago. Further, it is becoming clear that
hyperthermals, environmental breakdowns driven by massive volcanic eruptions, were likely the
cause not only of the mass extinctions at the ends of the Permian and Triassic periods, but of many
more events. The aim here is to explore how hyperthermals kill plants and animals, both in the
sea and on land, using the Permian—Triassic mass extinction as the exemplar event, because it has
been most studied, but it provides models applicable to all hyperthermal-driven crises on Earth.

The idea that large igneous province (LIP) volcanism might have caused mass extinctions
emerged through the 1980s and 1990s, when Rampino & Stothers [1] and Courtillot [2
documented the coincidence of timing between phases of LIP volcanism and mass extinctions.
The link between volcanism and killing had in fact been noted earlier, when Vogt [3] suggested
