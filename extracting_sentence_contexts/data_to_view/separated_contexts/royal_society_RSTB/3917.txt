Xx HE. miliaris $, when the inheritance was maternal, as in the
years 1909-11, the presence of posterior epaulettes and posterior pedicellarize was
never so well marked as in the parent forms of H. aecutus and E. esculentus. In
addition, the appearance of these characters in the hybrids was to a certain extent
delayed, and their growth, after their first appearance, was slower than in the pure
species. This fact has also been noticed by Depatsteux (16). LANG (50) has
observed that in crossing snails, the rate of development of some of the characters
in the young hybrids is much slower than in the pure forms. In these experiments
Lane crossed Helix hortensis and H. nemoralis, where the parents are red and
yellow.
