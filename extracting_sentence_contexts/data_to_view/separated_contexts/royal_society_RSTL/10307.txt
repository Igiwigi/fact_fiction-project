constitutes the impurity and this exiguous 0'01 is the precious material to be extracted,
and when, moreover, its chemistry is absolutely unknown, the difficulties of the
problem become enormously enhanced. Tnsolubility as ordinarily understood is a
fiction, and separation by precipitants is nearly impossible. A new chemistry has to
be slowly built up, taking for data uncertain and deceptive indications, marred by the |
interfering power of mass in withdrawing eoluble salts from a solution, and the
slubility of nearly all precipitates in water or in ammoniacal salts when present in
traces only, What is here meant by © traces ” will be better understood if I give an |
instance. After 8ix months work I obtained the carth didymia in a state which mosb ©
chemists would call absolutely pure, for it contained not more than one part of _

water.”
