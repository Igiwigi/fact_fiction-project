symmetrically, and s0 nicely balanced as regards length, strength, and direction, that I
am of opinion the order of contraction is very precise and well defined. I am further
inclined to believe that the fibres of the several layers contract towards certain points,
the more longitudinal anterior, posterior, and lateral fibres contracting from above
downwards in the direction of the urethra s0 as to approximate the apex and fundus,
the slightly oblique, oblique, and very oblique spiral fibres contracting towards the
points where they cross each other, viz. towards the anterior, posterior, and right and
left lateral raphe. That this centripetal and downward action of the oblique fibres to-
wards the points of intersection takes place is rendered probable by the fact, that in the
contracted bladder the anterior, posterior, and lateral ridges (where they exist) are thrown
into bold relief*, the sides of the viscus in some instances coming together 80 com-
pletely that their mucous surfaces adhere. In such cascs, if any urine be present, it
is, as a rule, confined to the immediate vicinity of the uretral orifices, and not diffused
throughout the cavity of the bladder generally, as it would most likely be if there were
not a strong persistent lateral action.
