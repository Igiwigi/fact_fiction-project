We know as a matter of experimental fact, that the
specific inductive capacity will not thereby be largely altered. This will mean, not
that the quadratic expression in d is but slightly altered in form, but that the equal
expression in d’ is thus slightly altered. Moreover, to express simply the fact of
electric and magnetic isotropy of fluids requires that the independent variables should
be the dashed letters. Let then

Ids =Uds =U'ds’ orl=ml’=ml” ...... (1)
where
L is an explicit function of 0, ; p’, P, v;d, D, C, H
v ‘ " 60°; psp’, ¥s a, DC, Hs 9 - (2).
i” ” ” 0, eo; Ps ps ¥; a’, he Cc", H”

Defining \’, X” similarly, it may be said here what will appear incidentally later,
that \’ and U’, and again, ” and 1’, are related to one another exactly as are \ and /;
