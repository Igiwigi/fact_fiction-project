According to MULLER (17, p. 272) this anastomosis and the trunk that connects the
lower lateral cutaneous artery with the supra-hepatic rete, which he regarded, taken
together, as a simple branch of the lateral cutaneous artery, constitute one of the

trunks of supply to the supra-hepatic rete ; he figures it as an unbranched vessel running
from the lateral cutaneous artery to the rete, and evidently did not observe its connection
with the lower lateral cutaneous artery. This is an important omission, and probably
led MULLER to the assumption that the flow of blood within this vessel is to the rete,
whereas it is almost certainly the other way, from the rete to the lower lateral cutaneous
artery. For what Mier takes to bea single vessel is in fact twoâ€”(1) a trunk connected
at one end with the supra-hepatic rete and the pericardial artery (fig. 15, /.lat.cut.r.) and at the other directly continuous with the lower lateral cutaneous artery; and
(2) a branch (the anastomosis) (fig. 10, an.)
