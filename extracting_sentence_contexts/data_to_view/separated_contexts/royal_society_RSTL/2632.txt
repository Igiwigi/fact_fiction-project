The same re-
marks apply in comparing the horizontal columns ec and x or c and cf.

43. In comparing Tables X. and XI. there is one important fact to be observed ;
viz. that we do not get the exact ratio of the respective quantities of electricity on the
charged cylinder until we arrive at the most perfect inductions, as in the action of
the plates p and g : here the reactions are as 2: 1, or nearly 80, whereas in comparing
the similar plates and parts touched with the less powerful plates d e Â£ the discre-
pancies are considerable, evidently showing that we have not really arrived at the
true ratio of the quantities by means of these plates. 44.
