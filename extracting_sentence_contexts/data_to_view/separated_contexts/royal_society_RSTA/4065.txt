If remotely
applied transverse tension (or compression) and in-plane shear stress are combined with the :
axial tension, then these additional loads will affect the local load transfer by changing the local :=
stress field. Without fully analysing these modifying effects, it is commonly assumed that the 23
transverse load (tension or compression) has no effect and that the in-plane shear contributes to
the fibre failure mode in tension in the form of a quadratic interaction, as in equation (2.3). In mea)
fact, this equation also suggests that if the in-plane shear is the dominant loading mode, then :
the mechanisms of shear cracks leading to transverse crack formation, discussed in §§3e and 4e, a]
will be modified by the imposed axial tension in the same way. Obviously, this assertion is not DNS
supported by any analysis at the microstructural level. ares

Consider next the fibre failure mode in compression, discussed in §§3b and 4b. Although [8
different mechanisms underlying this failure mode are possible, in the common case of glass— .
epoxy and carbon-epoxy, the mechanism involved is plastic microbuckling leading to kink-band
formation.
