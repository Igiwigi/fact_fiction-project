where Q,, means 0Q(q, 4) /0q and not, as in (1-1), 0Q(g, 0) dq. The suitability of the trans-
formation is verified by the fact that, on the critical locus (2-2), the coefficients in (2-4) are
regular and those of the second derivatives are not all zero.

In general, a single-valued solution Q(q, ¢) of (2:4) is converted by (2-1) into a multiple-
valued function of g, @ with branch points on the locus (2:3). It is easily proved that 0°4/0¢°
vanishes only when sing = 0 or g = 0, +1, so the said branch points are in general simple.
If « = 0 they are real in the supersonic range g,<q<1; but if «+0 there is only one real
branch point, at which # — 0 and q has the subsonic value satisfying

To find the position co-ordinates from a solution (9, ¢) of (2-4) we use (1-4) along with
