Most currently used models in biology, cognitive psychology and economics are either classical-
like statistical models or (probabilistic or statistical) models based in chaos and complexity
theories. In many cases, these models work reasonably well. However, there also appear to
be phenomena in considering which they do not appear to be effective or work at all: their
predictions fail, similarly to the way such models failed in the case of quantum phenomena, which
failure gave rise to quantum theory, beginning with Planck’s law.

Beginning with A. Tversky and D. Kahneman’s work in the 1970-1980s (e.g. [50]), certain
experiments in cognitive psychology encountered situations predicting which appeared to
require (non-additive) probabilistic rules akin to those encountered in quantum mechanics. This,
naturally, suggested using quantum-like models in mathematical cognitive psychology and, then,
economics, in part in view of the fact that certain economic behaviour, too, involves psychological
factors of the type analysed by Tversky and Kahneman. Previously, these factors had not been
considered in mathematical economic modelling or elsewhere in economics. Kahneman was
eventually awarded a Nobel Prize in economics (Tversky died a few years earlier and thus
was not eligible). At this stage of history, if one needs a model able to predict quantum-like
probabilities or, more generally, address experimental situations analogous to that of quantum
mechanics outside physics, one need not invent an appropriate new formalism. One already
has mathematical models that could be used—those of quantum mechanics or of quantum field
theory, although models based in the latter are uncommon beyond physics. It might be noted that
most of the quantum-like models currently used in cognitive psychology are finite-dimensional,

180f course, in the Bayesian scheme of things, there may be events to which one cannot assign probabilities, but not in general.
