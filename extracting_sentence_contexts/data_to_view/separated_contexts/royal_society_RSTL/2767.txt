The vulgar doctrine about this In--
fAuence is, that it is exerted at the ſyzygies and quadra=.
tures, and for three-days before and after each of thoſe ;
epochs. There are 24 days therefore in each ſynodic'
month, over which the Moon at this rate is ſuppoſed to
preſide; and as the whole conſiſts but of 29 days 124 |

hours,



[ 279 ]

hours, only 5+ days are exempt from her pretended do-
'minion. Hence, though the changes of the weather
ſhould happen to have no connection whatever with the
Moon's aſpects, though the fact ſhould be, that they take
place at all times of the Moon indifferently, and are diſ-
tributed in an equal proportion through the whole ſyn-
edic month; yet any one who ſhall predict, that a
change ſhall happen on ſome one of the 24 days af-
Soned, rather than on any one of the remaining 52,
Fill always have the chances 24 to 5+ in his favour. Kerely becauſe more changes will fall with in the greater
Hme, and, upon an average, as many more in proportion
= the time isgreater. It is evident therefore, that this is a
Matter in which men may eaſily deceive themſelves, eſ-
pecially in ſo unſettled a climate as that of this iſland:
nd the advocates for lunar influence are not to imagine
they have fact on their fide, unleſs it ſhould appear, ,
From ſuch tables as theſe carefully kept for a long courſe
#f years, that the changes happening on the days, which,
hey hold to-be ſubject to the Moon, are more than thoſe
Fhich happen on the nemipies mm in a much greater
Proportion than that of 24 to 55.
