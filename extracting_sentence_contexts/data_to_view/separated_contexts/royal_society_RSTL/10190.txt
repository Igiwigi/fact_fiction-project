When we learn that the © displacement” in a conduetor
having a current in it increases continually with the time, it is almost impossible to
avoid picturing something moving along the conductor, and it then seems only natural
to endow this gomething with energy-carrying power. Of eourse it may turn out that
there is an actual displacement along the lines of electromotive intensity. But ib is
quite as likely that the electric © displacement” is only a function of the true displace-
ment, and it is conceivable that many theories may be formed in which this is the
cage, while they may all account for the observed facts. Mr. GLAZEBROOK has already
worked out one such theory in which the component of the electric displacement ab
