cases; and the respiration absolutely so, The skin, as above stated, is well warm,
even to the tips of the hands and feet. Further, the fundamental distinction between
the condition and that induced by any chemical nervous depressant, is clear in the
following two features. (1) The spinal motor neurons, though profoundly inaccessible
to stimuli, applied vd skin or afferent nerve-trunks, are perfectly open to any applied
vid the pyramidal paths : excitation of the pyramidal tract at the top of the cord
evokes as readily as or more readily than ever, in both limbs, its usual variety of
movements. (2) Excitation, mechanical or by weak electric currents quite impercep-
tible to the tongue, of the central ends of the spinal posterior (dorsal, sensor y) roots
emselves, fairly readily evokes the usual reflex movements elicitable—although enor-
‘ously stronger stimuli fail absolutely when applied to the skin and afferent nerve-
unks. At first finding this, I supposed an explanation might lie in the fact that
die roots contain large numbers of afferent fibres from muscles,* while the peripheral
#erve-trunks and surfaces tried, are chiefly cutaneous ; but excitation of the spinal end
& the hamstring-nerve, with its quantities of afferent nerve-fibres from muscle and deep
Siractures, caused no more effect ; caused, in fact, less effect than a pure cutaneous
snsory trunk, such as the long saphenous. This condition, although most usual and
Sriking i in the Monkey, and therefore here chiefly described in his case, is seen, to a
rtain extent, also in Cat and.Dog. When, in them, the spinal depression is great,
Bi is easily found to be more marked when examined by excitation of skin or peripheral
rves, than when examined by excitation of the afferent spinal roots ; the motor
“Reactions, provokable from the former, are less ample and less numerous than from
he latter. It is no question of escape of exciting current to the motor roots
Shomselves. Finally, this further point seems clear, from the above analysis of
