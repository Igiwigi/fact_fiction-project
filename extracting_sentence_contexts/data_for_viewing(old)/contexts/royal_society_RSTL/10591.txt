plot 16 has, on the average, not only of the two complete separation-years, but als
including those of partial separation, yielded considerably more total gramineous
herbage, more leguminous herbage, and about the same amount of miscellaneous.

It would be of little use to compare the actual produce of individual species on the
three plots with that without manure, though the results are given for reference in
the table, The comparison of the produce of the different groups and species on each
of the two new plots with that on 16, is of much more interest. The most striking
points indicated are that, although there was a much greater amount, of both Agrostis
vulgaris and Festuca ovina on both plots 19 and 20 than on plob 16 in the first
Separation-year (1872, which was also the first year of the experiments on 19 and 20),
there was, in the second separation-year (1877), on both a less amount, especially of
Agrostis vulgaris. The fact is, that whilst both these grasses had increased considerably
from the first to the second of these two separation-years on the older plot 16, each
greatly diminished from its higher original amount on plots 19 and 20. Alopecurus
protensts again showed on both the new plots, and in both seasons, a great deficiency
compared with plot 16, although on both it showed an actual and considerable
increase. Toleus lanatus, on the other hand, was in much greater, and in more
rapidly increasing, amount on the two plots 19 and 20 than on 16 ; and it inereased
very much the more largely on the nitrate of potass plot 20, where in the second
separation-year it contributed more than a third of the total gramineous herbage.
Avena flavescens also, especially in the first year, yielded considerably less on plots
19 and 20 than on the older plot 16, though on both it rather increased in actual
amount. Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perenne, and Avena pubescens, were also each
more or less in deficiency on plots 19 and 20. Cynosurus eristatus and Anthozanthum |
