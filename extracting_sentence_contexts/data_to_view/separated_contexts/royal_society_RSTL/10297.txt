When a dry mixture of carbonic oxide and hydrogen is exploded with 12 to 15
per cent. of oxygen, at a pressure greater than the critical pressure, and at a tom-
perature 8ufficiently high to prevent any condensation of steam, the coefficient a 18
found to be 4 when the hydrogen is equal to or greater than the carbonic oxide, but
3:7 when the carbonic oxide is three times the hydrogen. This difference I believe to
be due to the fact that carbonic oxide and oxygen, under the conditions of these experi-
ments, are incapable of direct combination, 80 that when the volume of hydrogen taken
is less than double the volume of the oxygen, there is present during a part of the
reaction an excess of oxygen chemically indifferent to the three other gases presentâ€”
steam, carbonic oxide, and carbonic acid. 672 MR. H. B. DIXON ON CONDITIONS OF CHEMICAL CHANGE

For instance, in the last three experiments of Table XL., where 17-5 parts of oxygen
were exploded with 73'3 of carbonic oxide, and 26'7 of hydrogen, there was only sufficient
hydrogen to burn at once 13:3 parts of oxygen ; now, supposing the hydrogen to have
been all burnt at once, then the other 4'2 parts of oxygen had to wait until the corres-
ponding quantity of steam, formed at first, had been decomposed by the carbonic oxide,
Of course the steam produced at first immediately began to react with the carbonic
oxide, but owing to the deficiency of hydrogen, the rate of formation of steam was
limited, during a considerable portion of the reaction, by the rate of formation of
carbonic acid through the double decomposition of steam and carbonic oxide. The
intensity of the reaction was thus diminished.
