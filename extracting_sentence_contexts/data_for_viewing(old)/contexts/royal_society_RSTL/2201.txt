harbours thus circumstanced is generally uncertain, and in tempestuous weather is
frequently dangerous, or eyen impossi√æle.

The action of the sca, which gives motion to the shingles and produces the evils
complained of, has long been a subject of speculation ; but I have not found that it
has been systematically investigated. Indeed, the contrariety of opinions advaneed
npon the subject, sufficiently indicates an entire absence of that satisfactory mode of
inquiry which is essential to the foundation of a safe and practical deduction.

Very little has been written upon the snbject ; and such facts as have been men-
tioned have only been referred to incidentally, or with a view to geological science.
My present object is exclusively practical in its nature, and my observations have
been limited to such facts as would assist in establishing certain and fixed rules for
controuling the motions of the beach, so far as to enable us to preserve a clear channel
through it in all seasons, and in every variety of weather ; and to accumulate and pre-
serve the shingles, where it is needful to do 80.

The suhject at first sight appears greatly complicated ; and were it necessary to
discuss minutely all the modifications arising from the variety of forms and local cir-
cumstances, it would perhaps be too much 80 for general description. I have, how-
ever, limited my investigation to those simple and unyarying laws to which nature
always adheres; and therefore the following observations must be considered as re-
stricted only to certain general principles, subject to a variety of modifications.

The principles which I propose to illustrate will (under similar circumstances) at
