SAMPSON: A NEW TREATMENT OF OPTICAL ABERRATIONS. 157

If we compare the scheme

1+, o/B
—(1l—n) B+By—eBo, n+y—-o

with the equations (4), we see the aberrational scheme is the equivalent of a linear
scheme, for a single surface, for which the plane of origin passes through the point
x = o/(1—n) B, that is, through the actual point of incidence x = $B(b,?+¢,")...;
if we take the curvature as B(1+4eq?+4er*), and the refractive indices « (1—48’—4y’),
nu’ (1—487—4,”) respectively. As to the latter it may be noticed that the exact equation for refraction of a ray
impinging at the origin, and in the plane Ozy, is

w sin (tan-? 8) = w’ sin (tan-' 6’)
or, to our order,

un (1—$6*). 8 = nw’ (1-48"). 6. Hence the aberration y may be described as due purely to the obliquity of the ray
to the axis, and the aberration w to the lateral separation from the axis, and we see
that the somewhat remarkable fact that two functions w, y suffice to express the
aberrations of every ray may be stated in the form that there is no term which is
produced jointly by obliquity and lateral separation. If in any instrument we have a number of surfaces each introducing aberrational
terms, and if the schemes preceding and following the surface (7) be compounded so
as to read, say, {g,...}, {g’, ...}, then the whole may be represented by

9; h 1 +0,, o,/B, g, hv
. . (10)
k, l ae (1 —n,) B, + By, —¢,B,w,, Nyt We— Wo, K, v

and the portions added to the general scheme in consequence of the aberrations of
the 7 surface will be

and in this the schemes {g,..-}, {g’,...} may be taken at their “ normal” values

without regard to aberrations introduced by surfaces other than the surface (7). If
then we write, adding the effects of all the surfaces,

and if we now denote by {g,...} the scheme got by compounding all the normal
schemes of the instruments in succession} whether these are refractions, or mere shifts
