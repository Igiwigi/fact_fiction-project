pull could any evidence that this indicated the original presence of spores be
obtained. A feature of difference from Y. oblonga is that there is no trace of the
differently organized tip to the sporangium. The difference in the method of
preservation makes it difficult to decide how much reliance to place on this distinc-
tion, but it appears to be real and may be important.

Discussion

The examination of these specimens had led us to interpret them as exhibiting
asmall number of large sporangia grouped on the end of a stalk, and to regard it as
highly probable that these sporangia were radially arranged and coherent to form
a peculiar fructification. The presence of the outer zone continuous with the margin
of the stalk, and the fact that in none of the specimens was there any sign of the indi-
vidual sporangia being displaced or diverging from one another were in favour of
some type of firm coherence among them. Though incompletely known, it appeared
to be a peculiar type of fructification suggestive of derivation from a terminal group
of large sporangia of the kind known among the Psilophytales. Comparisons with
Telangium and Xenotheca (ARBER and Goopr, 1915) suggested themselves as possible,
though not close. The description would have been left with this interpretation
in the hope of more light being shed on the question by the discovery of better
preserved specimens.
