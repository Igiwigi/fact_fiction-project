of proto-helium is primarily of the Fundamental type; the three associated series
may be regarded as coincident with it. (9) The “ Pickering ” lines associated with the “4686” series are also probably due
to proto-helium, in which case the series would include lines nearly coincident with
the Balmer series. The observational evidence on this point is incomplete, but the
assignment of these lines to proto-helium is supported by the fact that one of the new
combination series of magnesium is related to the “4481” series exactly as the
extended Pickering series would be related to the “‘ 4686 ” series. (10) The slight differences between the observed positions of alternate lines of the
“ 4686” series and those calculated by Rypsere for the “ Principal ” series of hydrogen
are in very close agreement with Bonr’s theoretical formulz for hydrogen and proto-
helium.
