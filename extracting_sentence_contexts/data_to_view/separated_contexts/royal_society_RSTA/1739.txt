For Z ~ 1, as in the hydrogen hot-spot, this leads to field
growth rate 0.3fT,/(elzlr) ~ 20 Tps}. The collisional source term can be of a similar magnitude to
the Biermann term. In fact, it may exceed it. This is because hydrodynamic motion acts to smooth
the pressure gradients and reduce the Biermann growth. The collisional term has no such natural
stabilization, since it acts on composition gradients which can even exist in pressure equilibrium,
such as in an ideal isobaric hot-spot.
