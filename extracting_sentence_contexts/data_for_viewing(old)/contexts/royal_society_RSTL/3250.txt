167. The figures in Plates VI. and VII. illustrating © &ages,” I have thought it
proper to draw on fixed scales, scrupulously copying nature in regard to size. If
however, these figures be referred to, the not uninteresting fact will be made evident,
that there is no fixed relation between the size of the entire ovum, and the degree
of development of its most essential parts. An extraordinary instance of this is
afforded in Plate VII. fig. 124. where in an oyum of less than 4” the embryo had attained
a stage far beyond what is usual in ova many times as large (par. 218.). On the other
band, Plate VI. fig. 110. presents an instance in which development (as compared
for example with that of the oyum fig. 113.) appeared to have been retarded.

168. Nor do any two parts of the ovum necessarily keep pace with one another ; a
fact well shown in Plate VII. fig. 124., where the incipient umbilical vesicle (bb7) and
the structure am. are very far behind the embryo in the degree of their development.

169. In the following description therefore of successive stages, it will not in ge-
neral be desirable to state particularly the dimensions of the oyum, nor minutely to
detail the condition of any of its parts but those that serve to mark the stage.

Third Stage of Development.

170. When discharged from the ovary in the state exhibited by Plate V. figs. 96. and
97., the ovum was found in the following condition at the distance of one inch from
the infundibulum in the Fallopian tube (Plate VI. fig. 103. «.), The germinal vesicle
(c), was visible in the ellipsoidal mass that occupied the centre of the fluid yelk.
