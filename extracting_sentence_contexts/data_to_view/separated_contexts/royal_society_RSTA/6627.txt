LEMMAS ON CONVERGENT PRIME IDEALS

£ It has been mentioned that certain problems in ramification theory are untouched by the
Bheory of the discriminant-ideal, as represented by Theorems 6 and 7. The rest of Part I is
Edevoted to such problems. The results of §§ 6 and 7, applicable to strongly convergent prime

deals, are generalizations of the main classical theorems on prime ideal structure associated
with the classical different-theorem.{ The need for such generalizations is placed beyond
Sdoubt by the fact that a case of Theorem 13 has already been used in the geometrical papers
Oof Zariski. In §7 there is also a discriminant theorem, Theorem 10, which to some extent

overlaps Theorem 7. If the maximal condition holds in , every prime ideal of ® is strongly

+ The statement and proof of Theorem 7 would clearly remain valid if, contrary to one of the conditions
paid down in the Introduction, Z were inseparable over K.
