they represent (stand for) previously experienced quantities and they enter into
computations. We must keep both roles in mind when we look for them.

When looking for a brain mechanism, we entertain various candidate mech-
anisms. These are hypotheses of the form ‘x is the thing for which we are
looking’. To decide among the candidates, we must form as clear a picture as
we can of the properties that must be exhibited by a neurobiological entity
for it to be the basis for a plausible hypothesis. I elaborate on the referential
and operational constraints on numerons first. I then consider what these
constraints suggest about the neurobiological realization of numerons.

My focus is on numerons as entities in long-term memory, that is, on symbols
that carry quantitative experiential facts forward in time for use in computations

the symbols in memory stands in contrast to the focus of con-
temporary neurobiological work, which is understandably on
