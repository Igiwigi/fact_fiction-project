with 1 and 0 referring to the values nj; =1 and nj; =0, respectively (recall that 5[n;(C;)] refers
to the Dirac delta-function). In equation (4.4), the dependence in t —t’ comes from the fact
that the average is not done over AW but over an expression like equation (3.2), with t — fo
replaced by f’. By following an analogous procedure to that shown in Bronchart et al. [10], the linearized
evolution equation for the coarse-grained values fj, may be written as?
