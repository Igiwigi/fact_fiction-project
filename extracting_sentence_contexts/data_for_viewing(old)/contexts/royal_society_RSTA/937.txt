Second, the question of jurisdiction will become inevitable, especially with the scale of
international breaches. Equifax and Facebook are internationally functioning bodies, and so
impact citizens internationally. The European Union may have been one of the first entities to
implement modern data protection regulation, but inevitably most questions and legal concerns
about data usage will strongly involve notions of national boundaries.

Finally, various bodies and professional societies have proposed standards to guide data
governance and privacy. For example, the British Standards Institute has already proposed a
standard for the ethical design of robotic devices (BSI BS 8611:2016 Robots and robotic devices);
there are also multiple IEEE standards (https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/) projects in this area.
Should regulation lag behind or prove difficult, establishing standards may be a soft approach
to the topics of data governance and privacy. In fact, this type of approach may well mirror
suggestions offered by Reed [5] in this issue.

7. The impact of algorithms on human behaviour

Human behaviour is often the subject of data collection. Savings in terms of costs and general
utility will no doubt accrue after further application of analytics to this type of data. Concerns
in terms of using such data are often in terms of the monopoly of a few entities in being able to


collect such at-scale observations [14]. Entities in the commercial sector are increasingly instituting
their own ethics committees [78] to allay public concerns. The notion of a monopoly is now being
discussed in terms of data, as it becomes increasingly clear that the diversity of human behaviour
