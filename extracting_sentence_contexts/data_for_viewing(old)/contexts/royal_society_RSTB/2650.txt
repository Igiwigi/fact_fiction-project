scopic structure resembles Paleozoic carinate Cyathophylloids, and it is possibly best
looked upon as a curious antetype of the synapticulate Fungine, resembling certain
Cretaceous types even more than the known Jurassic relatives.

(3). Thamnastreine represented by the typical genus Thamnastrea of distinct
Mesozoic character, and introducing the great Jurassic concourse of this extinct sub-
family of the Fungide.

(4.) Astraide. This large family, although so profusely represented in the Triassic
fauna, is of distinct post-Paleeozoic character. Indeed, its preponderance in individuals,
together with the striking radiate character, have done much to encourage the idea
of a paleontological break between the Palzozoic and Triassic-Recent coral faunas.
Yet the curious fact is that everyone admits, in a general way, the descent of this
family from the Paleozoic Cyathophylloids. The latter may be said then to have
most completely undergone a change in form during the interval that elapsed between
Carboniferous and Triassic time. At the same time, true Cyathophyllids are present
in the St. Cassian Triassic strata,* which is a somewhat older deposit than the
Zlambach strata above discussed,

According to those results, I find it utterly impossible to accept Professor Frecu’s
dictum that “The great change of the Anthozoa had been carried out before the
Muschelkalk and after the Permo-Carboniferous period.” I have indicated, in direct
contradiction of this, the connection afforded by the Jurassic corals with the main
groups of Triassic corals, and have brought forward evidence of a continued series of
