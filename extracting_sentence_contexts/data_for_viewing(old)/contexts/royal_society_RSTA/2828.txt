1-270km diameter) with near-random spatial distribution [30-34], leading to proposals of
catastrophic resurfacing and the suggestion that Venus’ geologic records span only a few
100 million years [4,35-38]. The related global stratigraphy hypothesis calls for catastrophic
emplacement of 1-3km thick ‘wrinkle ridge plains’ across approximately 80% of the surface
[39-42]. However, a growing number of studies are inconsistent with the notion of catastrophic
resurfacing and global stratigraphy [3,10,11,13,43-51].

Absolute time is difficult to constrain. Venus’ lack of small craters (due to atmospheric
screening) greatly hampers surface age determination, and assumptions about surface formation
severely limit unique temporal interpretations across even huge areas (>>2 x 10” km?) [30,52].
Crater density and crater flux models indicate a global average model surface age (AMSA) of ca 750
+350/—400 Ma [53]. AMSA represents an integrated geologic history; it is not an absolute age, nor
does it reflect a singular unique history. In fact, crater density together with crater modification
data [54,55] reveal three separate AMSA provinces of sub-equal areal distribution (figure 1b)
[10,11]. The lack of spatial correlation between these AMSA provinces with topography, crustal
plateaux (old), tesserae (old), volcanic rises (young) and fracture zone terrain (young) suggests a
rich surface history. Although we currently have no means to determine the absolute geologic
time represented by Venus’ surface, Monte Carlo modelling indicates that the impact crater
characteristics held up as ‘evidence’ for catastrophic resurfacing (near-pristine, near-random
distribution, etc.) can be accommodated by plausible geologic histories spanning several billion
years [56-58].
