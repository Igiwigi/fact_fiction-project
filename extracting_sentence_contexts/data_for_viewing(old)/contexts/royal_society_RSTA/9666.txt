were dealt with in four groups—

(A) Sunspot minimum years, 1890, 1899, and 1900;
(B) Sunspot maximum years, 1892, 1893, and 1894;
(C) Highly disturbed years, 1891, 1895, and 1896 ;

(D) Other years, 1897 and 1898.

The largest “character” figure for the five days 107 to 111 occurred on day 111
in group (A) and day 110 in group (B), but on day 107 in groups (C) and (D) ; while
the lowest figure occurred on day 108 in group (A), and on day 111 in groups (C)
and (D). Considering this variability, much weight cannot be attached to details in
the results for the fourth associated subsequent pulse. The fact, however, that the
figures for all five days 107 to 111 are so decidedly in excess of the normal seems
clear evidence that this pulse is by no means negligible.

The primary pulse in Table V. shows the two characteristics noted in the discussion
of fig. 2. The third day prior to the representative disturbed day is decidedly quieter
than the average day. The rise to the maximum in the primary pulse is considerably
more rapid than the subsequent fall. This a-symmetry is also clearly shown by the
first and second associated subsequent pulses. :

The ratio borne by the excess of the maximum “ character” figure for the primary
pulse over the normal to the corresponding excesses for the associated pulses are as
follows :—
