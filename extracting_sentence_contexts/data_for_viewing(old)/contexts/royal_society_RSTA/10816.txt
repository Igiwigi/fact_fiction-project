The experience gained during this eclipse indicates that the determination of
definite intervals before totality by the observation of the cusps is of great value.

Observations on Natives, Animals, &e.

Three observers were told off to note the behaviour of the natives, animals, &c.,
during the eclipse. The notes were collected by Lieutenant Buackerr, who has
summarised them as follows :—

“The natives, so far as was observed from the fort, were not much disturbed
by the eclipse. They had been previously warned not to light fires, the smoke
of which might interfere with the observations, and also not to make a noise. On
the beach a few—according to a matter-of-fact observer thirteen—ran into the sea,
and bathed, as is their custom on these occasions; they also set up a discordant
yell for 3 minutes. It was ascertained afterwards that a large proportion of the
natives retired to another beach about 3 miles away out of sight and hearing
of the fort, and here, undisturbed by the local police, were able to bathe and howl
ad infinitum.

“This district being particularly devoid of land birds, owing to the barren
nature of the soil, not much was gained from observations. A few small birds
twittered a good deal during the partial phase, and especially about 10 minutes
before totality, but at 7 minutes before totality a sudden silence fell on them all.
Some crows (Corvus hiemalis) were observed to roost, and martins were seen to be
flying unusually high. Bats were not observed to be disturbed in any way,
