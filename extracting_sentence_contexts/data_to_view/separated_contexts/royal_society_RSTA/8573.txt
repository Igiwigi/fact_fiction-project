Similarly if ~ has no singularities and v is a solution which behaves like e~*"/R
near a particular point P (R denoting the distance measured from P), we see that

: du _,, 0) ag =
(7°11) (ue » St) 8 = Arp,

provided that P is inside the surface S. Equations of similar forms apply when tlie space considered is outside the surface
8; but then the sign of the last equation (7°11) is reversed, giving

é : ow ou ‘
(7°12) f(uS—o oH) dS = + detip

it is then necessary to assume also that at infinity, u, v both correspond to
divergent waves (unless it is known that wu tends to zero more rapidly than 1/r).

* Compare MACDONALD, loc. cit., pp. 120-122. The cause of the difficulty is to be found in the fact
that now the stationary value may be expected to arise from values of n for which « is small. Then n is
nearly equal to z, and in all such cases more complicated analysis is inevitable. In fact the approximations
to S, (2) and E, (2) require to be modified by different formule corresponding to the cases n > 2, <2
and to the cases in which |n —2| is of order 2/s or of lower order.
