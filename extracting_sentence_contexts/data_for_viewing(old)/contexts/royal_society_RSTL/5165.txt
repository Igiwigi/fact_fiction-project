A FACT not yet well understood is the spontaneous formation of nitric acid, or
rather nitrates which takes place when azotic organic matters putrify in contact with
strong bases and atmospheric air. Some chemists hold the opinion that under the
cireumstances mentioned, nitric acid is formed ont of the nitrogen of the organic
substances and atmospheric oxygen, both elements being determined to unite with
one another by what is called the predisposing affinity of the bases for nitric acid.

Others maintain that the said acid originates entirely from the oxygen and nitrogen
of the atmosphere, and suppose that these elements are by a sort of capillary action
brought into such a condensed s8tate as to combine into nitric acid, under the addi-
tional influence of the predisposing affinity of the hases for that acid.

According to the notions prevailing at present nitric acid comes from ammonia,
