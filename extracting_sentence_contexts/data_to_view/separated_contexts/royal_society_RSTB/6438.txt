The action of the lateral ciliated tract is confined to the left side of the gut, and
particles entering down the right side of the oesophagus will be more remote from its
influence. It has been seen that there is a backward ciliary current on the right side
(fig. 4, v.) which will naturally help to drive them backward, but the complication
here is the existence of a strong forward current along the roof of the diverticulum
(dc.). Owing to the fact that the diverticulum passes to the right of the oesophagus
and pharynx, particles on the right side of the oesophagus will be much more influenced
by it than will those on the left side. It is a fact that in transverse sections of animals
which have been placed in a carmine suspension for some hours, carmine particles
can be seen in the lumen of the diverticulum, and it must be the forward current along
the roof of the diverticulum which is mainly responsible for this. The existence of this
forward current is perhaps the most puzzling feature of the alimentary canal.
