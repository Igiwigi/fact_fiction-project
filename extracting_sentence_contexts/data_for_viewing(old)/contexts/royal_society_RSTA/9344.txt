The complete passage from the ¢-form to the $-form must take place in three stages,
corresponding to the fact that hair in cold water may be stretched twice as far, and hair
in steam three times as far, as hair which is perfectly dry. It is possible that these three
stages are an expression of the three obvious ways in which the «-chain may be written
down, but in any case it seems clear that the constituent involved in the middle stage,
from about 30 per cent. extension to about 70 per cent. extension, is that part of the hair
substance which is sufficiently crystalline to give rise to the X-ray photographs. It is
proposed to deal with this, and all the other many points bearing on the complex elastic
properties of hair, in the next communication of this series —W. T. A.|
