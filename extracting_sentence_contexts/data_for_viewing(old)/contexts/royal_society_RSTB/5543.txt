formed the labrum-epipharynx of the caterpillar. The latter, it may be mentioned,
possesses a slightly bifid labrum reminiscent of the double origin of this organ.

(b) Mesoderm.—It has already been pointed out (HAsrHAmM, 1927) that anterior to the
region concerned with mesoderm formation by overgrowth and invagination, a region
of proliferation is set up from which develops a mass of cells, the anterior mesenteron
rudiment. The first three pairs of mesoblastic somites behind this are those of the
mandibles, maxillee and labium respectively. The position of these appendages has
already been noted and little need be said about their associated mesoderm beyond
the fact that it develops in the same way as in other regions of the body behind (Kasr-
HAM, 1927) and that each somite lies against the base of its appropriate appendage
(fig. 50). The head mesoderm in front of the mandibles, however, develops from the
proliferated mass of cells hitherto designated anterior mesenteron rudiment. The area
of such proliferation marks the position of the future mouth and the cells arising on the
yolk side of the germ hand at this place are continuous with the mandibular mesoderm
behind them.

Three distinct mesodermal units are formed: an anterior mass of head mesoderm is
separated from the anterior side of the mesenteron rudiments ; this is the labral meso-
derm belonging to the protocerebral segment of the head (fig. 55). It passes forwards
and part of it enters each of the hollow labral lobes. A more posterior part of it separates
off and lies behind the epipharyngeal lobes overhanging the mouth (figs. 53 and 54).
