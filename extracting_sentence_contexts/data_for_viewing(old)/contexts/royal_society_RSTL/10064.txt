Lucas (24), 1811, described the gland as divided into lobes, lobules, and alveoli
(follicles). He noticed that the alveoli, when seen from the surface, have a polygonal
area,

Sir A. Coortr (25), 1832, gave drawings of the lobes of the Calf's thymus, with the
communicating vessel. (See his fig. IT.) He found that the thymus consists of ropes,
which can be unravelled, and which are disposed in a spiral manner ; he thought he
recognised two large absorbent vessels, which run down the cervical portions and
terminate in the innominate vein.

HavasreD (1), 1832, confirmed JacopsoN's (19) obxervation as to the difference
between the fat glands and the thymus, and demonstrated most clearly the imcrease of
8ize in the thymus after birth ; giving drawings proving both facts. He noticed that
if thin layers of the thymus of infants are viewed by transmitted light, the central
part of the follicles is more pellucid, He found the supposed cavity in the thymus to
be hardly present in health.

GuLrirver (36), 1842, noticed a 8omewhat similar fact to that which had been related
by WrArrox (34), as he 8aw that, in overdriven Lambs, the thymus shrinks ; but that
if the animals are afterwards well fed, the gland fills out again. Gvrzver followed
Hrwsox (10) in considering that this organ provides germs for the tissues of the
blood.

Biscnory (28), 1842, also considered that the function of the thymus is to form
blood corpuscles.
