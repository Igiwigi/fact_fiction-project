Indeed it
is difficult to conceive how a body of the formula C,, Hz, O;, can be decomposed into
alcohol and carbonic acid. It is therefore far more probable that the formula of this
substance is C,, Hz, O:z, which is also that of grape-sugar when dried at 100? C. In
fact, were it capable of being crystallized, it would no doubt be considered as iden-
tical with grape-sugar. If this be granted, then it follows that the formula of rubia-
nine mast be either C,, H;, O,; or C,, Hy, Og, as will be seen by the following equa-
tions :=
