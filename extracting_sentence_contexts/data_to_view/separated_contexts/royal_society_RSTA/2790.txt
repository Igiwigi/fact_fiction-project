A THEORY OF ASYMPTOTIC SERIES. 283 The novelty introduced in these assumptions lies in the fact that we consider a,
and R, (or, more precisely, the moduli of these quantities) as functions of n for all
values of n, no matter how large. Tt will be convenient to give names to the quantities A, B, /, 1, p, o; we shall call
k, l, p, Â© characteristics of the series (1); & will be called a grade, l an outer grade,
pa radius, o an outer radius of the expansion, The quantities A and B will be
called constants of the expansion. Tf an inequality of the form (1A) can exist when k=, but not when k <k,, we
might, for greater precision, call /, the principal grade of the series ; and the smallest
possible value of p associated with /, might, in like manner, be called the principal
radius ; similarly we could define the principal outer grade and the principal outer
radius, But it is found that this additional precision is unnecessary, and we will
accordingly prove all our propositions for any possible characteristics ; and, further,
it may be stated that the characteristics, determined for particular series (such as
the asymptotic expansion of the gamma function) by the ordinary processes of
analysis, are of such a magnitude that, although they may not be principal
characteristics, we could not expect to obtain any additional knowledge of the
functions investigated by knowing the actual values of the principal characteristics.
