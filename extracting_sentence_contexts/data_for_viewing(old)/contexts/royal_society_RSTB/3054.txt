There is no satisfactory evidence in support of the view that the true ferns have
been derived from the Cycadojilices, although these appear to have considerably
antedated them in time.

The descent of the Leptosporangiate ferns from the Botryopteridee@ seems to me
much more probable than from any other paleeozoic group, as far as known to us
at present. In such existing genera as Lygodium, Gileichenia, and Trichomanes,
which have protostelic cylinders, there is a great resemblance in general type of
structure to the stems of the Botryopteridee, though they differ in many details.
In fact, these existing genera have a most archaic facies, not only in the structure
of their stems, but also in some cases in their dichotomously divided fronds, and
amongst palzeozoic “ferns” dichotomy of the main rachis and pinne was of very
frequent occurrence. Not only in these points do some of these genera agree with
the Botryopteridea, but there is still occasionally seen on the sporangia of
Lygodium and Schizea an annulus formed, in part at least, of more than one row
of cells, though the annulus here occupies a different position on the sporangium
from the corresponding structure in the Botryopteridee.

Future discoveries may give good ground for altering some of these views, but
from what is at present known of these ancient types of vegetation, these conclusions
seem quite justified,
