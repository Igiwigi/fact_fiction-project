man.’

’Notably, hypotheses which highlight the advantages conferred by
propensity to learn and by social status associated with linguistic pro-
ficiency, are compatible with this scenario [101].

° Additionally, recent findings show that previously, the productive
abilities of monkeys’ vocal tracts significantly underestimated their
vocal capacity. In fact, monkey vocal tracts appear to be speech-
ready [109].

‘That some of the subject matter of communication during teaching
was structured (tool production) does not imply that the com-
munication itself had to be structured identically. Conceivably,
for example, a communication system could be improved through
an increase in referentiality, without incorporating structure.
Even communicating about hierarchically structured tools is
possible using non-hierarchical referential sequences. Such communi-
cation may indeed have been an intermediate phase of language
evolution [132].
