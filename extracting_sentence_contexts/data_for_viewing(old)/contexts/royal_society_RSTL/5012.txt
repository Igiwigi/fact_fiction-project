volve; each is essential to the maintenance of life. The history of the chylaqueous
fluid and that of the blood-proper will be studied in this class with more minuteness
than in the former, for it seems not a little probable that the © tangle unrayelled” by
the study of these fluid elements of nutrition in the Annelids will conduce to more
exact views than those now prevalent in physiology with reference to the mechanism
of nutrition in all invertebrate animals.

All the recesses and ramifications of the general cavity of the body in the Annelids
communicate freely with each other, constituting thus one common space. This
space is lined by a distinct membrane, which is obviously the anatomical analogon of
the peritoneum, and is filled by a fluid which is wngquestionably an organic fluid, In
the Annelida the peritoneal membrane is not vibratile, the oscillations of the fluid
contents cannot therefore be due to ciliary vibration. This fact distinguishes the
Annelids from the Echinoderms, Medus# and Zoophytes : it further proves that the
movements of the chylaqueous fluid are not in ALL cases dependent on the presence
of cilia. The rule is snspended in this class. In Glycera alba, and in one or two
other species, however, the peritoneum where it penetrates the appendage is lined by
vibratile cilia. Anteriorly to the researches herein recorded, I am not aware that any
anatomist has recognised the real physiological meaning, or described the true
histological characters of the chylaqueous fluid in the Annelida. In the historical
introduction to this paper I have already indicated the extent to which the researches
of M. QuaTreraces have proceeded in that direction. To him undeniably belongs
the credit of having independently determined the fact of the existence of *a fluid” in
the visceral cavity of the Annelid. The first publication of his generalized results
occurs in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles for 1852. The results of wy dissections,
