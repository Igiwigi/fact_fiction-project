182. Thad made the principal part of the foregoing observations,—when two others
followed, which had not been at all anticipated. For, although the facts observed
had led me pretty nearly to the conclusion, that every tissne in the body has its origin

A in corpuscles having the same appearance as corpuscles of the blood, —yet the thought,
@ I confess, had not occurred, that the spermatozoon and the oyvum might be imme-
E diately derived from the same source. It was not until the red colouring matter was
S noticed, by which I recognized corpuscles having the same appearance as altered
E blood-corpuscles, in some seminal fluid under examination, from the testis of a Bird,
= that the idea suggested itself, and led to a farther examination.

E which bave been mentioned in the preceding pages, now make it easy for me to see

& of discs, or rather, cells filled with discs,—the altered nuclei of corpuscles having the
© Same appearance as corpuscles of the blood.
