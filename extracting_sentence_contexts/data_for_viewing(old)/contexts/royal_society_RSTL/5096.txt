Recurring now to the ratios in Table XIIL., and directing our attention to the
character of the inequality which they show to have existed in the amount of
disturbance in different years, the facts which present themselves most obviously
and unquestionably to our notice are, that in the years 1843, 1844 and 1845, the
ratios were uniformly considerably less than unity, and that in the years 1846, 1847
and 1848, they were as uniformly considerably greater than unity. The mean ratios

in the three first years are, at Toronto 0'69, and at THobarton 0-68 ; whilst in the
three last years they are at Toronto 1:33, and at Hobarton 1-34, Facts of such
remarkable character, evidenced by the independent and concurrent testimony of 80
large a body of observations at stations 80 widely distant from each other, seem
to be well deserving the consideration of magnetical physicists ; more particularly
of those who are disposed to regard thermometrical differences as the cause of the
periodical and other magnetic variations. The ratios of disturbance in the years
1846, 1847 and 1848, were nearly twice as great as in the years 1843, 1844 and
1845. Did there occur any notable differences of either local or general temperature,
or thermometrical peculiarities of any description, in the years in question, to which
variations of such magnitude in the ratios of magnetic disturbance can be ascribed,
or with which they can be connected ?

We should not however derive all the advantage which an examination of the
