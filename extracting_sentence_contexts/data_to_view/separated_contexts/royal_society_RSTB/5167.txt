Leaf-scars are seen at each node, but the preservation is
too poor to afford evidence of the occurrence of scale-leaves or short shoots, and it is not
possible to identify the leaves with certainty. The association of leaves apparently
agreeing with S. Hirikiana and the fact that similar leaves are attached lead me to regard
the specimen as a branch of Sciadopitytes. ‘The upper internode is narrower than the
lower, a feature recalling branches of the recent Sciadopitys in which, as Mr. WALTON
pointed out to me, there is a considerable reduction in the amount of vascular tissue from
one internode to the next above. Locality.—Upernivik Naes.
