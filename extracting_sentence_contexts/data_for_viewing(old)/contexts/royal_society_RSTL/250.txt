of producing exactly the same symptoms as the original disease.
This effect of inflammation upon the end of a nerve, explains
the startings of the limb which occur too frequently after ampu-

bf tation.

&1 These most commonly are met. with when the- limb is taken
E off above the knee, and the nerves and-vessels have; been pre-
S viously inflamed higher than the part | at which they were
E divided; and where the nerve is confined by the thickened
SI state of the surrounding parts.

5 The same fact also explains the cause of locked jaw, when
