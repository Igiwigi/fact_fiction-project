This synchroni-
zation occurs at the global level between the automaton
and the transients, and not between the cells of the auto-
maton. When TIGoRS is present, there is a nonlinear
relationship between the input sampling rate and the
Hamming distance between the transient stimulus and the
transient response of the automaton. This synchronization

occurs in spite of the fact that the underlying rule space of
the automaton is constantly changing. The presence of
TIGoRS demonstrates that finite duration spatio-temporal
transients are the proper dynamical states to be studied. In
the presence of TIGORS, the dynamical action on these tran-
sients causes the dispositional cellular automaton to act as a
primitive stimulus-response system [33].
