The asymptotes of P(X) are determined by the singularities of the generating function G(y). For
X; — —oo, the leading singularity in the upper half plane is y=2:. This follows from the fact
that for any i there is a finite probability of zero amplitude, so that the moments (|q;|1 diverge for
q < —2. At the left tail, it gives limy,_, 55 P(X;) « exp(—2X,), which is indeed observed in figure 6.
It is not clear at the moment how to find the singularities in the lower half-plane that determine
the positive moments and the anomalous exponents.

Of course, if multipliers were statistically independent, then (8.2) would break into a product
and one would be able to find the statistics of amplitudes using the standard tools of large
deviation theory. Such theories of multiplicative cascades go back to Kolmogorov’s work on
ore pulverization, where at every step of the cascade a stone is broken into random pieces
independent of the previous steps; assuming a finite variance of multipliers one obtains
