We make the approximation that the sufficiently close in space and (ii) the recombination distance =

of this range the allele is either fixed or lost. We take €=1/2K, is that clines will only attract each other if there is a spatial S

copy of the allele is present in the deme. For a carrying double heterozygotes are produced (see electronic sup- =
