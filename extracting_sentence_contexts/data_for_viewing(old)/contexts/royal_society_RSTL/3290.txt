lowing case proves, and it deserves particular attention, that the limits of the ancient
waters cannot even approximately be inferred from the present extension of the an-
cient beach-lines. MaccuLLoca has drawn in his map a shelf intermediate between
the two upper ones, on the face of the mountain (Tombhran) opposite to where Glen
Turet joins Glen Roy: Sir Lavpzr Dick has not noticed this shelf*. Perceiving its
* Until I aw this shelf I doubted its existence, because I had not been able to discover others mentioned
by Maceviiocn : thus one is figured by him in a ravine branching from Glen Roy (improperly called by him
Glen Fintec), which, though having ascended it, I was unable to see. Again MaccuLLocu =tates, that two
shelves occur in Glen Gluoy, whilst Sir Lauvzr Dick, who seems to have examined most carefully this glen,
could find only one. I may here remark, that should two shelves be hereafter discovered there at the same
relative height from each other with those of Glen Roy, and this is tated to be the case by MaccvLLocn,

the fact would be highly satisfactory on the theory of the shelyes having been sea-beaches. From an excellent
point of view, however, on the ide of Ben Erin I could see no trace of a second shelf, MaccuLLoch also

importance I examined it with serupulous care. It occurs rather nearer the lower
than upper shelf, and as these two are only eighty-two feet apart, and are here strongly
marked, it was scarcely possible (especially as I purposely looked at it from every
point of view,) to,make any mistake in the absolute parallelism of this intermediate
shelf. It can be traced for nearly three quarters of a mile; at the west end disap-
pearing quite insensibly, like the lines in Glen Collarig, but at the other end rather
more abruptly in a water course. I walked along its whole length, and its structure
