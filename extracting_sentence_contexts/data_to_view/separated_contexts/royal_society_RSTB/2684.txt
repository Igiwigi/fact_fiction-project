With an agreement so close in this respect, we might reasonably expect to find an
equally marked correspondence between the jaws and suspensory apparatus, but, as
we have already seen, this expectation is disappointed. These structures in |
Palseospondylus remain, we believe, without any precise analogy. Reasoning upon
the observed facts alone the position of the gammation and pre-gammation is as
anomalous on a Selachian as upon a Dipnoan interpretation ; they suggest the idea of
a divided sub-orbital bar, but this, though ending close to the middle line of the skull
on the one hand, and to the auditory capsules on the other, is united to neither. The primitive connection of the quadrate bar with the trabecula in the Dipnoi and

Amphibia is behind the eye, and this is the connection of the gammation with the
cranial walls in our youngest specimen, but in larger specimens, though apparently
freed from this connection, the gammation has not entered into union with the
auditory capsules ; it may have done so, but there is no absolute proof that it did. Still, our friend, Professor Brrpe@r, who has carefully studied our reconstructions,
remarks that “it looks as though such a connection must have existed” ;
in this we fully concur, and if we may assume that the appearance represents
the fact, we may identify, as we have done, the gammation with the hyo-
mandibular, the pre-gammation with the palato-quadrate, the posterior trapezial
with the hyoid, and the anterior trapezial bars with the mandible.
