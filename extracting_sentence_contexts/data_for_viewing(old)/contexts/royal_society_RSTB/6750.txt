Corbicula africana, Cleopatra pirothi, etc., all nilotic species which serve to show that the
lake has been above this point since the last lava was extruded, and since the introduc-
tion of the nilotic molluscan fauna to the lake basin, that is, after the early Middle
Pleistocene. On the other hand, these shells could not have reached a position about
140 ft. above the present lake at a later date than the Gamblian rise of the lake (see
Table, fig. 8). Therefore they are not younger than the beginning of the Upper
Pleistocene. But before that time two lavas had already been extruded, the earlier

having been heavily eroded before the extrusion of the latter. This fact seems to indicate
a considerable lapse of time during which subaerial weathering was taking place, and
this may well have been during the Chelleo-Acheulian retreat of the lake. The
Mollusca recovered from the underlying deposits include only three species, but none
of these is known from other fossiliferous horizons of early Middle Pleistocene or
later age in the lake Rudolf Basin, and it suggests that the Gaza Beds are of still earlier
age. Finally, two of the three species of Mollusca from Gaza are identical with Kaiso
forms from Lake Albert and Lake Edward. The third species is also known from the
Kaiso, but is given a varietal name for local palaeontological purposes (see Appendix
A). On the above evidence the Gaza Beds are taken to be of Lower Pleistocene age.

Unfortunately, there is no record of Mollusca having been found in those of the
Omo Beds which have yielded the mammalian fauna. Nevertheless, the occurrence of
