The case was found to
be very different however with Australian skulls ; some, it is true, gave confirmatory
results, as, for instance, No. 991 with the nasion 67 millims. and the fronto-zygomatic
suture 63 millims. above the plane, but in others, such as Nos. 998 and 999, all three
sutures stood at the same level, while in others again, No. 995 for instance, the
nasion measured 61 millims. and the fronto-zygomatic suture 64 millims. above the
plane. The skull of a Zulu followed Krampercer’s law, the nasion having a height
of 60 millims. and the zygomatic suture of 55 millims. FACIAL CHARACTERS OF THE NEANDERTAL RACE. 331

Whatever may be the rule for the majority of existing races, KRAMBERGER’S
statement cannot be applied to the Australian skull; but were, the facts even as this
distinguished observer asserts, it does not appear to me that they furnish a sufficient
basis for the conclusion he derives from them, viz., that the frontal bone is elongated
towards the nose (“dass das Stirnbein nasalwiirts verlingert ist”). On the contrary,
the nasion, as shown by angular measurements (p. 323), is not rotated forwards and
downwards to a markedly greater degree than ig the Australian skulls we have
described : and if a comparison be made on the basis of the Frankfort line, it will be
found that the nasion of the Gibraltar skull stands in some cases above, and in
others lies below, that of the Australian skulls. Owing to the absence of fixed
points in the skull, it is difficult when two sutures change their relative position to
determine the relative share of each in the movement ; but in the present case I am
inclined to think that the displacement has chiefly affected the fronto-zygomatic
suture which has been shifted upwards in recent skulls as a consequence of the
shortening of the fronto-zygomatie process.
