* Although the remnants of the latticed rods are faint, they appear to be actually continuous with the
spicules from which the two plates arise, and in other specimens this is clearly the case.


CALCAREOUS TEST OF ECHINOCARDIUM CORDATUM. 275

In Eechinus miliaris the writer (1926, p. 267) showed that genital 3 arose as a prolifera-
tion of the right postero-dorsal spicule, and that genital 5 was similarly formed from
the right post-oral spicule. The fact that plate y in Echinocardium cordatum is formed
from the same larval spicule as is genital 5 in Eehinus miliaris seems to prove that plate y
is indeed genital 5.

The small spicule lying anterior to the anus (a.) is undergoing resorption and will soon
disappear entirely. If it is assumed that plate y is genital 5, the arrangement of the
ocular and genital plates around the central anus recalls that found in a regular urchin
such as Hehinus. The membrane in the neighbourhood of the anus must represent
the periproct of the adult.
