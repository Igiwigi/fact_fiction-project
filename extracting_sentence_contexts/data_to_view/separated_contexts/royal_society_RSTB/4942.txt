Thus, in all, five tube-feet, those belonging
to the first series (Ia-Vb), are passed on to the buccal membrane. What happens to
these ? The fact that the secondary series of buccal tube-feet are in all respects similar
to those found in the corona, and are at first external to the buccal plates, seems to prove
that they have in reality come from the ambulacra. Further, small buccal plates are
laid down opposite the inter-ambulacra before any appear opposite the ambulacra
(fig. 31). Fig. 32 shows that, although plates have now appeared between the large
buccal plates and the ambulacra there is a distinct space (X) opposite the plates Ia, Ila
IIIb, 1Va, Vb, which would be sufficient to allow of the passage of a tube-foot.
