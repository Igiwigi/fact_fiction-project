fig. 8(a) or (b) does not indicate the path actually followed by a characteristically
polarized wave-packet incident upon the ionosphere at an angle @ to the vertical. It
merely indicates for each level in the ionosphere, both for the upward and downward
journeys, the directions in which individual wave-crests move across the wave-packet

when situated at that level. The actual path followed by the wave-packet still remains
to be investigated.

There emerges from this interpretation of figs. 7 and 8 an interesting and important
fact concerning the critical electron density which must be attained in the ionosphere
in order to return a magneto-ionic component to the surface of the earth. It might be
thought that this critical electron density could be deduced by putting the angle of
refraction y equal to 47 in Snell’s Law as we did in (2) for the case when the earth’s
magnetic field is neglected. Since, from fig. 4, putting = 47 is equivalent to putting
q = 0, this method would imply that the critical electron densities of the magneto-ionic
components are given by the points D and F in fig. 7, that is, by the levels d and ¢ in
fig. 8. This method is in general wrong. For we now see that it only expresses the con-
dition that individual wave-crests are moving across the wave-packet horizontally,
whereas the true criterion for critical electron density is clearly to be obtained by
expressing the condition that the wave-packet as a whole is travelling horizontally.* We
may expect that the critical electron densities are actually given by the points A and B
in fig. 7 since dq/0 N is infinite there, and we proceed to prove that this is in fact the case.
