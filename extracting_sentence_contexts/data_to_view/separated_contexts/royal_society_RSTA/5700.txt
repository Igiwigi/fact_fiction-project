It would be of interest to see such analyses carried out for MHD,
both for EDQNM and for DNS, as well as in the context of the solar wind for which more refined
data is now available, including at small (ionic and even electronic) scales through the recently
launched MMS (Magnetospheric Multi-Scale) mission and the Parker Solar Probe. And finally, (v):
the direction of the cascade is not determined by these exact laws which can be observed to change
sign, for example in the solar wind for the total energy [88]. In fact, helical invariants in extended
MHD, which covers both the regimes of Hall current and electron inertia, have a more complex Da
behaviour [89,90]. Hg, which in that paper is called ion canonical helicity, is shown to undergo :3
either a direct or inverse cascade (in the latter case when the magnetic energy is in excess), a fact ad
that may be linked to its dominant physical dimensionality as the ion inertial scale varies. This DR
may also be associated with the non-locality of energy transfer, for example in Hall-MHD (see are
[91] and references therein). a)

(c)_ The role of cross helicity :8

The cross-helicity Hc is the correlation between the velocity and magnetic fields.
