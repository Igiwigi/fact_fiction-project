If, as is possible by means of the electric current, the discontinuity was filled up, by
liquid being forced into the black space, the equilibrium would be unstable. As 800n
as the external force was removed the © grey,” intermediate in thickness to the black
and coloured films, would be absorbed or stretched until ib became black.

(2.) If the simpler supposition is made that there is only one alternation of repul-
gion and attraction to be considered, the law of the change of the surface tension
might be represented as in fig. 2.

In this case there would be a preliminary difficulty in explaining the formation of
the black, inasmuch as when the point P' was reached any further decrease in thick-
ness would be resisted by an increase in tension. As a matter of fact, however, the
black is generally firs formed in small specks, and if, owing to a gudden disturbance,
the film were thinned to below the maximum of surface tension, equilibrium would be
poxsible if the thickness were that corresponding to Q”. The parts of the film of
thickness intermediate to P' and Q' would shrink, and an apparent discontinuity

would be established.

This 8upposition is als0 less satisfactory than the last, inasmuch as the equilibrium
would be nnstable. An accidental thinning below Q' would produce rupture. The
