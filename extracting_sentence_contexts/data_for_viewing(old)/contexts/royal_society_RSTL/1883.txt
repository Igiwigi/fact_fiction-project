versed variety of which is much songht after by the Chinese ; Oliva oryza,
Nassa reticulata and IN. Thersites; but there are some genera in which I do
not recollect to have noticed its occurrence, as, for example, the Cypraee and
Ovule.

A bivalve shell is composed of a dextral and a sinistral valve, united together
by a ligament. When the two valves are separated, and spread out on a table
with the umbones above, and the front end towards the obseryer, the valye to
the right (the left when on the animal and in its usual walking position,) re-
sembles a dextral, and that to the left a sinistral, very depressed spiral shell.
This is well illustrated by comparing the left valve of an Isocardia with a Con-
cholepas. In some very rare instances these shells also are reyersed, but the
fact is not easily observed, except in the unequal-valyed kinds. 'There were
formerly in the TANKERvILLE collection two specimens of Lucina Childreni, in
one of which the right valve was a dextral shell, in opposition to the general
structure. A much more remarkable yariation is to be obseryed in some of
those bivalve shells, whose under valve is attached to foreign bodies ; thus, for
example, most of the Chamce are attached by their left valve, but some species,
sch as Chama Lazarus, are frequently attached by their right valve, under
which circumstance the teeth proper to the left and usually attached valve are
transferred to the right, and vice vers.
