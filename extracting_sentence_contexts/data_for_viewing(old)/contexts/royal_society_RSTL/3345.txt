culum is turned to some bright object, as for instance the enamelled dial-plate of a
watch, or the moon. The irregularity of the whole surface will then -be apparent,
more at the joints where the speculum is in separate pieces, but still more where
there is a flaw or crack. The cause is obviously this: the metal under equal friction
wears everywhere unequally, and therefore the inclination of the minute portions, I
might almost say elements, of the surface, deviates slightly, but sensibly, and quite
irregularly from the general curyature, producing an aberration independent either
of general figure or aperture. A surface of speculum metal yields in the same irre-
gular way to the action of acids, as indeed all metals do, but the more s0 as their
texture is crystalline or fibrous. In proportion as the resinous surface is soft, and
the polisher heavy, the irregularity increases, and therefore we should conclude that
the harder the surface and lighter the polisher, the less the defect; and such is the
fact. The accuracy of the general figure depends mainly upon the motions of the
machine and the thinness of the resinous surface. If the resinous surface is 80 hard
that the particles of polishing powder no longer sink into it deep enough to be held
fast, then the polish is destroyed, the polishing process passing into that of grinding ;
long, however, before that limit of hardness has been attained, the resinous surface has
lost its essential quality of expanding laterally, and therefore of preserving its exact
coincidence of figure with the speculum. I have found that the two properties appa-
rently inconsistent with each other, can be imparted to the polisher at the same time,
simply by using the resinous composition of two different degrees of hardness, 0 as
to form two very thin strata, the outer one being the harder. The resinous surface
