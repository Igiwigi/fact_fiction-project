W. WARDLAW ON THE SHOOT APEX OF DRYOPTERIS

In relation to the experimental procedure, metabolic and mechanical factors are modified
and important morphological changes result. The growing region, in fact, shows con-
siderable diversity in its morphogenetic activity. This is true of the lateral segments as well
as of the isolated meristem. During normal growth at the apex, pressures and tensions
are developed between the several enlarging tissue systems.
