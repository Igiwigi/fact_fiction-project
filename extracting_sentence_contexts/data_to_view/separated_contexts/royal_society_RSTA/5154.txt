But however that ma
be, a consensus of various grounds seems to require the zether to be stationary on t é
present theory. Thus if the motion of solids moved the surrounding ether, t
moving solids would act on each other with a hydrodynamic forcive, which would |

THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 775

Again, such a view would disturb the explanation, as above, of the fact that the
reive on a charged conductor in an electric field is a surface-traction equal at each
joint of the surface to the energy in the medium per unit volume. There is in any
ase nothing contradictory in the hypothesis of a stationary «ther ; if the fluid is not
lowed to stream through the circuits of the atoms, we have only to make the
ordinary supposition that the molecules are at distances from each other considerable
ompared with their linear dimensions, and it ean stream past between them. 77.
