what features are of most importance. Any departure from the mean, whether rise
or fall, is followed sooner or later by a change in the other direction. Which change
is the most fundamental, or whether they possess equal significance, are questions to
which no reply is at present possible. The fact that the two falls shown by the
diurnal inequality occur, the one wholly in night hours the other wholly in day hours,
suggest these falls for consideration in preference to the forenoon and afternoon rises
of potential. They are compared in Table IV. with one another and with the range
of the diurnal inequality. When the principal maximum occurs in the afternoon
and the principal minimum in the morning, as is generally the case at Kew, the night
Sfall and the range are identical.
“ The .quantities in the three first columns of Table IV. are expressed as fractions of
the corresponding mean monthly values given in Table I. The ratio borne by the
Linequality range to the mean value for the month is much less variable than is the
Gabsolute value of the range, and a similar remark applies to the night fall. On the
other hand, the day fall actually diminishes as the monthly mean increases. At
Smidsummer it is very nearly as large as the night fall, but at midwinter it is only
