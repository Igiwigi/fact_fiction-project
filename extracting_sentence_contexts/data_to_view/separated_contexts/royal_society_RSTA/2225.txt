Kinetic energy tends to half of its initial
value. Therefore, at large times, mathematical expectations of kinetic and potential energies are
equal. This fact is in a good agreement with the results presented in paper [48]. Oscillations of the kinetic energies, described by formulae (6.3), (6.4), decay in time. At large
times, the system tends to thermal equilibrium, i.e. to a state with spatially and temporary
uniform distribution of kinetic temperature [37].
