The vessels do not exhibit their characteristic reticulations on the
surfaces which are parallel to this section. In every one of the sections which I have
made in this plane I have obtained the same result. The reticulated structure is con-
spicuous in the yascular walls parallel with the medullary rays; but instead of being
continued round the entire tube, the reticulations appear to terminate abruptly, and with
defined though irregular margins, as represented at d', on reaching the tangential surfaces,
which latter merely exhibit a thin, uniform, and apparently structureless layer of car-
bonaceous matter. 'These facts must be correlated with what I have previously mentioned,
viz. that in the stems of Asterophylites (se ante, p. 44) the reticulations of the vessels
were more definite on such of their walls as are parallel with the medullary rays than
are those tangential to them. The rays themselves (F') are numerous, and, like those
of the stem (Plate II. fig. 13), consist of from one to four cells (rarely five) arranged
in a single vertical line. Plate VIII. fig. 51 represents the lateral aspect of one of these
medullary rays, where the cells (F) are seen to have a regular mural arrangement.
