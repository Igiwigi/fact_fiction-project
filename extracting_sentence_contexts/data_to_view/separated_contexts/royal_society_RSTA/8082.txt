The series of terms of damped harmonics and aperiodic damping factors is not of any
particular interest, as it is noticed that no term can be large compared with the rest. On account of the fact that all the terms are damped it is continuous. If | < +g¢,x/2, there are no damped harmonies and the torsional couple expressed
by this series dies away aperiodically. If] > +,c.= 2. the torsional couple represented
by this series will change sign before it dies away.
