at each step ft, one needs to propagate only the amplitudes of the vertices exactly at distance t :=
from the initial vertex. This means that, in practice, one does not need to store in memory the a
entire transfer matrix T, but instead a new transfer matrix J; is defined at each step that only :B
propagates amplitudes from vertices actually relevant for that single step of propagation. This (2
requires storing only (N — H(y) ) non-zero entries instead of N2N of the full transfer matrix T = DA. DA

The vector v; needs to store only (") entries. 1M

(b) Numerical results :s

In this section, we apply the previously described methods to the transverse-field Ising spin
glass Hamiltonian (2.1). Here, we immediately face an issue: the computation of the forward
approximation is obstructed by the fact that the spin glass term Hy = — >; Jijojo, has highly
degenerate energy levels. This gives rise to diverging terms in equation (4.4) when E, = Ej. To
avoid this problem, we add a weak and random longitudinal field term Hong to the Hamiltonian

Ho:
Fong = — > hia,
i

where each h; is distributed uniformly in (—h,h) with h = 0.001 (this has to be < 1/N but > e~*).
This has the effect of splitting the degeneracies while introducing only a negligible effect on the
energies of the configurations (and therefore in the amplitudes Wq(b)) and on the amplitudes of
transition between non-degenerate states.
