Ss 5. LEMMAS ON CONVERGENT PRIME IDEALS

£ It has been mentioned that certain problems in ramification theory are untouched by the
Bheory of the discriminant-ideal, as represented by Theorems 6 and 7. The rest of Part I is
Edevoted to such problems. The results of §§ 6 and 7, applicable to strongly convergent prime

deals, are generalizations of the main classical theorems on prime ideal structure associated
with the classical different-theorem.{ The need for such generalizations is placed beyond
Sdoubt by the fact that a case of Theorem 13 has already been used in the geometrical papers
Oof Zariski. In §7 there is also a discriminant theorem, Theorem 10, which to some extent

overlaps Theorem 7. If the maximal condition holds in , every prime ideal of ® is strongly

+ The statement and proof of Theorem 7 would clearly remain valid if, contrary to one of the conditions
paid down in the Introduction, Z were inseparable over K.
+ Cf. Krull (19395), Fricke (1928), Dedekind & Weber (1882). The classical different-theorem is not
ectually a special case of Theorem 13, but can be deduced from Theorem 8 by a similar method. Theorems
for minimal prime ideals, deducible from the classical theorems by the method of prime ideal quotient rings
(as indicated in n. 35 of Krull (1935)), are likewise included in the results of §§ 6 and 7. The preceding remarks
about the classical different-theorem do not apply to the more penetrating ramification theorem of Grell (1936).
The first step towards a generalization of the kind effected here was taken by Zariski, who proved special
