caustic needle, pregnancy cannot continue. Whether Born’s theory is right or
wrong, FRAENKEL and Coun have undoubtedly demonstrated a very intimate con-
nection, already known to be close, between the existence of the corpus luteum and
the occurrence of pregnancy in so far as the latter appears to be in some way
dependent upon the former. But on the other hand, it is a now generally accepted
fact that whereas the ovarian changes characterising the early development of the
corpus luteum are the same, whether or not the discharged ovum is to become
fertilised (in other words, that the so-called corpora lutea vera and spuria are by
origin identical structures), yet the later changes depend upon the occurrence or non-
occurrence of pregnancy. In this sense the further development or degeneration of
the corpus luteum may be said to be determined by the state of the uterus.

From these and similar facts it may be inferred that the functions of ovulation and
cestrus do not stand to one another respectively either in the relation of cause to

* The questions concerning the ovary generally as an organ of internal secretion, and its possible
functions apart from the production of ova, have less bearing on the subject of the present memoir. For
a recent summary of the work done on these questions, Drxon’s paper (1901) may be consulted. It is
stated that after the performance of ovariotomy, menstruation generally ceases, the small percentage of

cases where it still continues being accounted for on the supposition that both of the ovaries were not
completely removed. But ovariotomy, like castration with male animals, has a profound influence over the
constitution as a whole, often seriously impairing the health, and not merely preventing the occurrence of
menstruation and cestrus. GLAss has shown that transplantation of the ovary, after ovariotomy had
been previously performed and had induced distressing symptoms and cessation of menstruation, may
