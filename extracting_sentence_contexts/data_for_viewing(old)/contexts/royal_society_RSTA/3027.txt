(a) Theorem 1.1 for anti-de Sitter space

Clearly theorem 1.1 is stated in very general terms, however, one might worry that there are
implicit assumptions about the global (asymptotic) geometry within which the black hole of
interest sits. In fact, all that is really required is that the radiation can be remotely separated from
the black hole’s interior and its surrounding neighbourhood (on distances large compared to the
UV cutoff, presumably the Planck scale). This is all we need to ensure that maximal entanglement
between R and B and/or N may be identified as contributing to the thermodynamic entropy of
these systems (as discussed in the main text).

What about if there is a boundary to the space-time, such as in AdS space? Here the radiation :
could travel all the way to the boundary and return in a finite time, so we have to worry about =
any returning radiation which is no longer well separated. In fact, there is a simple accounting 3
(or relabelling) trick that allows us to handle this straightforwardly. To see what this relabelling [8
involves let us first recall that Levy’s lemma constrains the correlations in a very general way: In :
particular, the order in which subsystems are ‘sampled’ is irrelevant, only the dimensionalities DA
of the identified subsystems play a role. This means that we can simply redefine R (figure 1) Dw
as that radiation from an earlier epoch that remains well separated from the black hole and its :2
surrounding neighbourhood at the epoch of interest. Any earlier radiation that falls back into the :g
black hole neighbourhood (or into the black hole itself) is then incorporated into B’, N’, R’ or some [&
combination of all three. :

With that relabelling everything goes through as before. The ‘PT’ (now no longer necessarily
a time) refers to any scenario where the thermodynamic entropy of any radiation, from earlier
epochs and which remains well separated from (B,N), equals one-half the Bekenstein-Hawking
