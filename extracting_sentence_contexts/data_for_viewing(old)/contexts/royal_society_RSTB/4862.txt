at one time of the year were associated with rainfall or lack of rainfall at another time,
then correlations would appear in the rainfall distribution values, and such correlations
would indicate the nature and extent of such mutual correlations between different parts
of the season. Hooker observed, in the short period of 21 years at his disposal, a correla-
tion as high as -+- 0-6 between the winter rainfall (1st to 8th weeks) and that of the pre-
vious autumn (37th to 44th weeks), and concluded that so large a correlation indicated a
real interdependence between winter and autumn rainfall. More recently W. 'T. Russet
(13, 1922) has calculated the correlation coefficients for monthly rainfall between con-
secutive and between alternate months. For Greenwich (65 years) no appreciable corre-
lations are found between successive months, but in the alternate months it is found
that June and August have a positive correlation -+ 0-55. Such a value should occur
by chance from uncorrelated material once only in 900,000 times, so that even allowing
for the fact that it is the highest of the 24 values obtained, it would appear to be sig-
nificant of a real association. It should, however, be borne in mind that any secular
changes either in total rainfall, or in its distribution through the year, as may exist at
Greenwich, have not been eliminated in this coefficient, and, in the second place, the
distribution of monthly rainfall is far from normal, and in consequence the probable
error of such a determination may be distinctly higher than that calculated for normal
distributions.

The correlations obtained between the 65 values a’,..., f’ are not, in any case,
high. The transformed values (¢ = tanh~' 7) are set out in Table VIII, since these
