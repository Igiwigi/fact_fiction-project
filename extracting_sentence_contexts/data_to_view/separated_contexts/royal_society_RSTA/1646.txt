Moreover, the solution is given
by

u(t, x) = I. flelAx+y)uldy), Â£>0, xeX, (4.4)

where i; is the centred Gaussian measure No,g, with covariance Q; for f > 0, and jug = 50.

(a) Ornsteinâ€”Uhlenbeck semigroups on spaces of continuous functions
The right-hand side of (4.4) is meaningful for every f â‚¬ By(X). Setting

Tee) :=| fle4x-+yuldy), #20, f EBX), vEX, (45)

T(t) is a contraction semigroup on 5,(X). The fact that T(f) maps B)(X) into itself and it is a
contraction is obvious. The fact that T(t) is a semigroup is less obvious. It can be proved rewriting
T(t +s), for t,s > 0, as

T(t +s)f(x)= I.
