The ingot was then cut and polished as usual. A comparison with
fig. 89 makes the great increase in the amount of H very evident. The Isolation and Analysis of the Bodies » and H.—The fact observed during the
etching of the alloys, that hydrochloric acid has no perceptible action on the crystals
of y or H, can be utilised for the separation of these bodies from an alloy in which
one of them is present together with tin. If we wish to get pure y, the alloy must
be sharply chilled at a temperature above 400°; to obtain pure H, the alloy must
have been maintained at a temperature a little below 400° for a period long enough
to transform all the y. It is in the observance of these two precautions that our
method of isolating the substances constitutes an advance on previous work.
