represented by spatial derivative operators must be added, thereby transforming the systems of ed

ODEs into systems of nonlinear partial derivative equations.

The attitude of Ilya Prigogine faced with these systems was that of a thermodynamicist
and a statistical physicist. He saw them as equations describing the evolution of macroscopic
quantities fluctuating out of thermodynamical equilibrium. For small excursions out of that state,
the equations are linear in the fluctuations of the macroscopic variables and nothing new appears :
apart from the equilibrium properties. However, for large fluctuations, these equations become =
nonlinear. Such large deviations can be sustained in a system by imposing on it external fluxes 3
of matter, momentum and energy. Ilya Prigogine realized that when the values of these fluxes
crossed some thresholds, qualitative changes emerged in the spatial and temporal organization nee)
of the systems. These transitions were in fact, from a mathematical standpoint, related to :
bifurcations. Very early, Ilya Prigogine foresaw that the emergence of primitive living organisms [4
from inanimate matter was due to such transitions appearing when some thresholds in the DN
intensities of external fluxes were crossed. a

Inspired by this vision he attracted many researchers from a large spectrum of disciplines and 8
engaged them in an extensive and multidisciplinary long-term research programme about the ,
properties of nonlinear dynamical systems. This programme concerned domains as far apart as
hydrodynamics, plasma physics or nonlinear optics, and molecular biology, insect societies, plant
communities or the growth of cities. This led his group to many important breakthroughs in these
fields [1].

Through many discussions, Ilya Prigogine transmitted the virus of nonlinearity to me. I mainly
