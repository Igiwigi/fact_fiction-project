Evolution of the efficiencies of the fluorescent OLEDs [1,7â€”12]. (Online version in colour.)

and the HAT-CN lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, a heterojunction
formed by these two materials is capable of dark generation of mobile charges in moderate electric
fields, a process that is frequently used in practical OLEDs to generate holes. The reverse reaction
is a typical recombination process, with one distinctive feature: the same close alignment of
energy levels that allows dark charge generation also unavoidably precludes recombination from
producing any electronically excited states of the molecules involved in a recombination event. In fact, the only electronic states energetically accessible as final products of such recombination
are the ground singlet states. Therefore, the yield of singlets is 100% and the yield of the emissive
excited state (nr) is 0%. Although this example neither explains high efficiencies nor suggests the
possibility of higher-than-expected yields of the emissive singlets, it clearly demonstrates that the
spin-statistical 3: 1 ratio can be drastically perturbed, for example, by the energetic factor.
