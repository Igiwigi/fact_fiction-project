Tn view of the statements made in his two papers that he did, in fact, discover some
steel alloys which were found to be of superior quality to those then made for cutting
instruments and edge tools, it seems quite possible that these could have been used

industrially or at least made the means of developing such steels after their further
improvement.

As regards corrosion, judging from the small specimens examined by the author in
this research, the results obtained did not differ materially from those of ordinary
steel; in fact, this could not be expected now we know the composition of Farapay’s
steel determined by the author’s examination.

§ 2.—Circumstances oF Farapay’s Researcu.

In order to obtain a proper perspective of Farapay’s work in this branch of steel
metallurgy, it is necessary to refer to certain events which occurred during the closing
years of the eighteenth century. About that time much interest had been aroused by
the reputed remarkable properties of Wootz or Indian steel. Dr. Hetenus Scorr,
afterwards first Member of the Medical Board of the Bombay Presidency, sent
specimens of this material to Sir Joseru Banks, then President of the Royal Society,
and who remained its President for no less than 42 years. At the instance of Sir
Josepu Banks, P.R.S., the nature and properties of Wootz or Indian steel were
