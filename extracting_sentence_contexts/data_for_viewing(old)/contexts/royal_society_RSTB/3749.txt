the quadrato-jugal, is a groove bounded on each side by a ridge. The lower jaw
bears a strong median ridge which plays in this groove and forms the main articular
connection—a very mammalian character. The inner of the two ridges on the
quadrate plays in a groove on the condyle of the jaw—thus recalling the Reptilia.
Thus in the whole arrangement there is a mixture of characters, but the mammalian
preponderates.

Another point of interest is the great length of the articular surface presented by
the lower jaw as compared with that on the quadrate. This renders possible a great
range of vertical movement or a wide gape, comparable with that of the sabre-
toothed tiger, and necessitated, as in that animal, by the existence of long tusks.
That the tusks were not used as digging organs is suggested, as Owen pointed out,
by the fact that they show no signs of wear; they were probably defensive organs,
possessed by the male, but not by the female (Oudenodon).

Lower Jaw.—Broom’s description of the lower jaw, written in 1904,* is a very
great improvement on that of 1901.+

The dentary is by far the largest and most massive bone in the jaw and is more
than half its length. Its upper surface presents two high and narrow ridges running
practically parallel to each other along the symphysis and diverging behind it.
Between them on the upper surface of the symphysis is a median prominence.

This arrangement of ridges and prominence is similar to that described by HuxLey
in (Dicynodon) Ptychognathus Murray: in 1859.{ On the outer side of the
