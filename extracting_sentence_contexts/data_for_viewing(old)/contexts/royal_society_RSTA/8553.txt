we thereby assume that any portion of the path relative to the air has a length equal
to that of its projection on the vertical, or in symbols

There remains, however, this distinction between s and h, that whereas h increases to a
maximum at the vertex and then decreases, s increases all the time.

With the approximation (10) and the fact (4), the vertical dynamical equation (8)
becomes

Tt is seen that (11) is of the same form as it would be in still air, so that we may regard h
as already given by the solution of (11) which has been obtained in naturalized form in
$4.3 above. When / is known, s follows immediately from (10).

And when s is regarded as independent of the relative velocities rx, ry, then the
dynamical equations (6) and (7) are linear in rx, ry as (1) and (2) were not. Further, in
(1) and (2) both components rx, 7y occur in both equations, whereas in (6) and (7) the
components have an equation each. For these reasons the approximation (9) makes a
great simplification. Of course, it cannot be valid at the top of the flight where ry = 0,
but the proportion of the erroneous part to the whole will diminish as greater heights are
