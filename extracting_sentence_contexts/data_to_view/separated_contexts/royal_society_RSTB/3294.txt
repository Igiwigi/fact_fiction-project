or more of
the whole mass of the coal ball. In some localities, however, iron pyrites figures largely
in the nodules, particularly in those found in the Halifax district, and there is
commonly a small proportion of iron carbonate. Itis an important fact that quartz is
absent, and that the amount of alumina and silicates is so minute as to be a negligible
quantity, except for purposes of minute analysis, thus showing that muddy or detrital
matter was absent from the mass of material which was petrified as “ coal balls,” and
that practically pure plant masses were mineralised by the dolomite or mixture of
carbonates. The amount of carbonaceous matter left as such in the mass is very
various, and it is probable that it depends on the state of perfection that the
mineralisation had reached (see p. 200). The presence of iron pyrites is so common in beds which are rich in fossils, and
so frequently results from later reactions, that it need not be taken into account in
dealing with the theoretical side of the question of the formation of the coal balls.
