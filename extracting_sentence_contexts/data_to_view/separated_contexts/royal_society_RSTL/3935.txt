In some cases I have seen the needle go back, in
others rise to 2% or 3%, But these variations are too uncertain in the greater number
of cases, and most generally correspond to a too sudden motion of the elements of
the pile which disturbs their contact. TW" HY

Let us then conclude that direct experiment answers negatively to the question
we proposed to solve, whether there were evolution of electricity in muscular con-
traction,

Having got rid of this part of the question, the next which presents itself is the
consideration of the phenomena which we observe in the proper current (for which
we employ whole frogs), and which consist in signs of increased intensity on first
touching the lumbar plexuses of the frogs with potassa, while, on the contrary, an
acid s0lution' causes the needle to fall instantaneously. To arrive at a knowledge of
these facts I have repeated and varied my former experiments, and the explanation
of the facts is as follows :—

Whatever be the form of the elements used for constructing the muscular pile,
that is to say, whether it be made of-entire frogs, of halves of thighs, or, as described
(fig. 13.) , if the surface of the muscular elements be bathed with an acid or alkaline
s0lution, it constantly happens, whether there be contractions or not, that the de-

the alkali be repeated, or the solution too concentrated, This effect is identical with
that already described, which occurs in the muscular elements immersed for a few
Seconds in acid or alkaline solutions.
