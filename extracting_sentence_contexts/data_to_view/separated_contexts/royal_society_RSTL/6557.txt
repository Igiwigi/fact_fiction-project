1st, that while the lateral masses of the ethmoid are Ccon-
tinuous with the vomer, the central plate is never truly continuous, but only con-
tiguous to the yomer ; 2ndly, that the central plate must, for reasons above stated,
play the part of a centrum ; and 3rdly, that, as Professor Goopsir has shown, Pro-
fessor OweN's view is inconsistent with the relation of the olfactory neryes to the central
plate F.

3. The frontal and the central plate of the ethmoid belong to one segment. The fact
of the central plate of the ethmoid having no early connexion with the yomer, as well as
its tendency to remain distinct eyen after the vomer and it have come in contact, shows
that it is not part of the same centrum as the yomer; therefore, inasmuch as we have
already concluded that it is a centrum, it can form no part of the vomerine segment. On the other hand, the presphenoidal centrum is complete without it. In these cireum-
stances it becomes apparent that the central plate of the ethmoid is the centrum of a
segment intervening between the yomerine and presphenoidal.
