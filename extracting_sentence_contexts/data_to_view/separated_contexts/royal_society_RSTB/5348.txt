The articular surface looks entirely outwards. The
clavicles, though preserved, are somewhat crushed, and there are small portions of the
interclavicles also preserved. The most interesting point in connection with the shoulder girdle of this specimen is
the fact that there is a large well-developed ossified sternum. In the plate this is figured
in the crushed condition, and in the text-fig. 2 as it would appear before being crushed. There is little doubt that its upper border articulated with the coracoid and its lower
border has a clear articulation for either a cartilaginous or bony xiphisternum.
