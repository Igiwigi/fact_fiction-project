Orange (maximum at about 6000A). This photoreceptor is probably identical with that
found by the author, at the fixation point for orange of 6200A; and the same as those
receptors which are found to give an orange sensation when stimulated by white, red or
yellow lights. Thus there is some evidence that this receptor has been identified in the
human retina.

Yellow (maximum at about 5800A). A definite fixation point was found for yellow rays,
but in no case was a sensation of yellow produced by micro-stimulation with other coloured
lights. Even yellow light itself looked white when a narrow ray was caused to fall on the
fovea. This substitution has been shown to be due to the antichromatic responses. In
favour of the presence of this receptor is the fact that this part of the spectrum has a very
high brightness. It is unlikely that this would be the case if there were in fact no receptors
present from 6000 or 6200A on the one side, to 5400A on the other. Stiles & Crawford
found quite a different retinal direction effect with yellow rays than for red, green, and blue
rays. Even allowing for experimental error, the magnitude of their effect in the case of
yellow was not the mean between that for red and that for green. This lends support to the
idea that yellow receptors are also present in the human fovea.

Many workers in the field of colour vision—Hering, Donders, and G. E. Muller—have
regarded the claim of yellow to be a primary colour, nearly as strong as those of red, green,
and blue. This view is substantiated by the result of experiments on adaptation. The colour
