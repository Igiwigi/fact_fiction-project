The method adopted ensures that there are no errors
arising from considerations of this character, which would be appreciable in comparison
with the unavoidable experimental error. In all the curves but two the original three-
volt standard could be retained. In fact, it approximately satisfied the condition just
described, the current at zero volts in these cases being on the rapidly rising part of the
characteristic. The relative currents thus obtained were then plotted for each series against the
actual volts given by the voltmeter and the amount of displacement along the voltage
axis was judged, which would be necessary to bring all the curves as nearly as possible
to coincidence. This amount is, of course, in general different for the different curves,
but is the same for every experimental point belonging to any one curve.
