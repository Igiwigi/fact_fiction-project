It differs altogether from the
22ous cgophageal band now distinctly recognized in 80 many Nematoids, not only by
£position, which is often far removed from the mouth, but also by its structure and
Eposition. No fibres can be recognized in its tisswe, it is considerably larger and
wker in 8ize, and, in addition, seems to be connected more intimately with the
z2phagus itself than with the parietes of the body. Rotwithstanding the existence of well-developed ocelli in many species of free Nema-
2s, both EprrTa and myself have been quite unable to detect any nerve-filaments in
Mmexion with them, or in fact any certain evidence of the presence of a neryous
Zem in these animals. That ch a system does exist I have not the smallest doubt;
nf considering the difficulties besetting its recognition even in large species of parasitic
Enatoids, I think that our failure hitherto in demonstrating its existence in these com-
matively minute animals is after all, notwithstanding their transparency, no very great
