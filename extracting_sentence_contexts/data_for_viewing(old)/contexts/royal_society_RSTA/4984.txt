that
Fi =F OL, or (Fj) ~F, @L,

and we will usually check it in this form.

Example 2.3. We just give quick examples here, leaving more detailed discussions to §3.

(1) Let U= G,,. Given n > 1 even (resp. odd) and a k-tuple (a;) of distinct elements of FF (resp.
elements distinct modulo +1), we take F; =[xaj]*Kn, where Ké,, is the n-variable Kloosterman
sheaf with trace function KI;,(x; p) (see §3).

Then (J;) is strictly U-generous. This follows from the theory of Kloosterman sheaves, in
particular the computation of the geometric monodromy groups by Katz [18], and the fact that
there does not exist a rank 1 sheaf £ and a geometric isomorphism

[xa]}*Ken = Kl, @L or [xa]*Kly ~ D(Ken) @ L,

for a#1 ifn is even, and for a ¢ {+1} if n is odd. (In other words, we have Auto(Ké,) = 1, and for
r>3 odd, Auti(Ké,) contains the unique special involution x +> —x; see §3 for details.)


(2) Given Fo self-dual and lisse on Gm, with geometric monodromy group equal to Sp,, such
that the projective automorphism group of Fo is trivial, and a k-tuple (a;) of distinct elements of
F, we may take F; =[xaj]*Fo on U = Gy, and (F;) is then strictly G,,-generous.
