have used a variety of motor sequence learning (MSL) paradigms which test the
process by which discrete, independent actions become unified and performed
effortlessly as a unitary sequence through repeated practice (see [3,4], for
reviews). Changes in performance seen during the acquisition of such skills
are known to be incremental, implicit in nature, long lasting and dependent
upon anatomical and functional plasticity within motor-related brain struc-
tures, including the striatum, cerebellum, motor-related cortical regions, as
well as the hippocampus (e.g. [5-8]). Yet, following the initial acquisition
phase, the newly learned information is then thought to be processed and reac-
tivated offline, such that initially labile memory traces become fixed into the
physical structure of the brain through a cascade of events occurring at both
the synaptic/cellular and the brain systems levels; a process called ‘memory
consolidation’ [9,10]. In fact, studies using MSL paradigms have repeatedly
shown that the procedural memory consolidation process of motor skill rep-
resentations is primarily observed hours or days after the first training
session, although Cohen ef al. [11] have recently reported that the same offline
