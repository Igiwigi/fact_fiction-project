Endothermy has been defined as
the presence of any mechanism of non-shivering thermogenesis that increases
both body temperature and resting metabolic rate (RMR) [1]. Mammals, the
only extant synapsids, are endotherms [2-5]. The origin of mammalian
endothermy is poorly constrained both phylogenetically and temporally, in
spite of the fact that the acquisition of this ability is a key innovation
(endotherms are less dependent on climatic conditions and can occupy more
ecological niches [6]). Many approaches have been used to constrain the phylo-
genetic and temporal frames of this acquisition. One of them involves
identifying unequivocal anatomical correlates of endothermy such as respirat-
ory turbinates or evidence for an insulative pelage [7].
