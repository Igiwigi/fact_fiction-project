Equations which show that O (as well as G) is a point of the Hessian, and that the
Dpoints G, O are corresponding poles of the cubic.

5 13. The line EF Joining a pair of conjugate poles of the cubic is a tangent of the
- ippian *.

AQ In fact, the equations (A), by the elimination of «, Þ, y, give

—(P+#f/+£)+(—l+4)Et=0,

which proves the theorem.

14. To find the equation of the pair of lines through F, and to show that these lines
are tangents of the Pippian.

The equation of the pair of lines considered as the first or conic polar of the conjugate
pole E, is

X(a*+21yz)+Y(4+2w)+Z(2*+20ry)=0.
