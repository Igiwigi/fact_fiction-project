A simple transformation of co-ordinates, using the matrix, (a), enabled the orientation
of a kamacite crystal with respect to the axes of the octahedrite to be obtained. For
example, in the case of crystal A, the cube axes, xyz, of the kamacite are related to the
axes, XYZ, of the octahedrite by means of the matrix, (b), given below:

X 14 Z
x +0076 -+0-758  —0-648
y +0148 +0634 +0-759 (6)
z +0986  —0154  —0-064

It is then found that the (011)-plane of crystal A is inclined at an angle of 1°-5 to the
(11T)-plane of the octahedrite. Thus crystal A belongs to the family of kamacite crystals
which have formed on Widmanstatten plane 1, a fact which agreed with visual observa-
tion of the crystal on the plane of section, PQ.

Some 21 kamacite crystals were examined in this manner. Of these 15 were found to
satisfy the test that a {110}-plane of the kamacite was nearly parallel to a {111}-plane of
the octahedrite. In all these cases the crystals lay along the well-defined directions of the
Widmanstitten figures. In the remaining six cases no {110}-plane of the kamacite came
within 9° of a {111}-plane of the octahedrite and the crystals were either of irregular
outline, or contained schreibersite inclusions (swathing kamacite). These crystals do not
belong to the Widmanstiatten structure. It should be remarked, however, that these six
non-Widmanstatten crystals were picked out for special study, and do not therefore
represent a random sample of the kamacite crystals. By far the greater proportion of
kamacite crystals are of the Widmanstatten type.
