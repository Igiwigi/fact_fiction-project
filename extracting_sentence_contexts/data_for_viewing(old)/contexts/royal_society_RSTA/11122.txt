often be approximately reached by a proper classification. In our present data the
probable errors vary from about ‘02 to ‘04, values which by no means hinder us from
drawing general conclusions, and which allow of quite satisfactory general results.

(2.) So far we have only spoken of the two classes, which are necessary if we
merely want to determine the correlation. But if we wish to deal with relative

variability we must have more than two classes. We have, in fact, in our tables
preserved Mr, Garron’s eight eye-colour classes and the seventeen classes under which
the coat-colour of thoroughbred horses is classified in WETHERBY’S studbooks, Such a
classification enables us at any rate approximately to ascertain relative variability,
and, what is more, to reconstruct approximately the quantitative scale according to
which the tints must be distributed in order that the frequency should be normal.
For, in order to attain this result, we have to ascertain from a table of the areas of
the normal curve the ratio of the length of the abscissa to the standard deviation which
corresponds to any given increase of frequency. Let us suppose that three classes
have been made—n,, 73, 3, represented by the areas of the normal curve in the
accompanying diagram so marked. Let , and p, be the distances of the mean from
