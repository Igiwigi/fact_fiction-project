compared with that thrown back more towards the sun, and the greater flatness of the”
heat-curve and the increase of percentage of heat transmitted by glass at or near full moon
are at, once explained.

The complete solution of the question would probably be complicated, and, owing to
the very unequal distribution of mountain and plain, perhaps unprofitable, even if we
possessed fuller data than we at present have on which to base our calculations.


OF HEAT FROM THE MOON. 627

A further, but probably a less important, cause for the divergence of the heat- and
light-curves lies in the fact that the moon's surface to a certain extent © regularly
reflects” as well as diffuses light and heat.

Let R, R' be respectively the light and heat regularly reflected.

D, D' be respectively the light and heat regularly diffused, unchanged in refran-
gibility.
E, F' be respectively the light and heat regularly absorbed and afterwards emitted.
F, F' be respectively the light and heat regularly radiated after more than one
reflection.
A As long as DE Ep=b the two curves will be identical, even though R and R' be
Wh different function of the elongation from D+E+F and D'+E'/+F'!. But if this rela-
