156 DR. FRANK HORTON ON THE DISCHARGE OF

The variations in Q are not greater than can be accounted for by the errors of
experiment. The mean value is lower than that given by Witson (viz., 131,100), but
this is probably due to the fact that the present experiments were performed with a
gas pressure of several millimetres in the apparatus, whereas Wixson’s result was
obtained in a good vacuum.

Taking Q = 121,900 and the current per square centimetre at 1610° C. as
5°91 x 1077 ampére, the value of the constant A in the formula «= A@le-2™ js
1:55 x 10°, so that the equation for the current « (ampéres) at the absolute

temperature # becomes
&@ = 1°55 x 10°,

The following is a comparison of the currents calculated by means of this equation
and those found experimentally.
