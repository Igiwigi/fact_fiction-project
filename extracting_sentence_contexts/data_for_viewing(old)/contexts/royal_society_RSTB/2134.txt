to the inclination of the axis of the shaft to the vertical
when the trochlea and capitellum are placed on a
horizontal plane.

The oblique length of the humerus does not represent
“so closely the effective length of the bone as does the

similar measure in the femur, but it would seem to be a

better measure of it than the maximum length. This

appears to be proved by the following rather remarkable
fact. On ascertaining the coefficients of correlation for the
lengths of pairs of bones, it was found that all the bones
except the radius were more closely correlated with the
tho. puvtioal.-Aubadeis. aha. anced maximum length of the humerus (AC) than with its
prominent point of head is oblique length (AC’). The radius, on the other hand, in
en "Veanan “ei, both sexes, would seem to be slightly more closely corre-

Let us consider the articulations along CC’. If the inner margin of the trochlea,*
C, be supposed to become a little more prominent, then the oblique length will be
shorter. Other things being equal, the humerus will be thrown further outwards
and the capitellum C’ will approach the head of the radius, which bone will con-
sequently have to be somewhat shorter if there is to be free play for the supination
