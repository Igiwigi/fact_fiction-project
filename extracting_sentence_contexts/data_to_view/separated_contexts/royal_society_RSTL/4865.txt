The ink passed quickly and
freely through three filters without losing any of its intense black colour, and carried
with it only a very few extremely minute granules, much smaller in size than the
spermatozoa of the Frog; 80 that it seemed fair to conclude that the colour imbibed
by the ova from ink, in MM. PrevosT and Dumas experiment, was due to the admis-
sion of the chemically combined colours of the fluid, and not to an admission into
the texture of the egg-envelopes of solid particles held merely in suspension in the
fluid. Consequently this experiment seemed to negative the supposition that, from
the fact of the interior of the egg-covering becoming blackened, solid particles of
matter, equal in s8ize to the spermatozoa, must have penetrated into the envelope
during its expansion ; and there seemed less reason to believe that the spermatozoa,—
bodies very much larger than the ink-granules,—could enter it. Carmine was then
tried. A s0lution of this colour could scarcely be made to pass through even a single
filter.
