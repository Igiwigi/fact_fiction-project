mechanism in many giant LBV eruptions (see review by Smith [1]).

Studies with quantitative spectroscopy [15-18] have disproven the conjecture that S Doradus
brightening events are caused by developing pseudo-photospheres in optically thick winds, as
suggested initially by Davidson [11] and reviewed by HD94 [7]. The mass-loss rates of S Dor
maxima are not high enough to make such large pseudo-photospheres, and so they are more
ikely to be caused by envelope inflation or pulsation [19,20]. This inflation may arise due to the
subsurface Fe opacity peak. Moreover, bolometric luminosities during S Doradus eruptions are
not really constant [17], probably because energy from the radiation field is put into work that
must be done to inflate the envelope. Similarly, the idea that giant-eruption maxima are caused
by pseudo-photospheres in opaque super-Eddington winds is challenged by light-echo spectra
of n Carinae [21,22] (although see [23]), by detailed analysis of the ejecta around n Car that are
better matched by explosive models [24-26], and by the fact that many extragalactic giant LBV
eruptions are relatively hot at peak luminosity rather than cool [3,27,57].

Two more recent results create severe problems for the traditional view of LBVs: (i) some core-
collapse SNe (especially Type In) appear to have progenitors that have been identified as LBVs.
This is prohibited in the standard view of LBVs as massive stars in transition to core He burning.
(ii) The environments of LBVs (and some SNe IIn) are remarkably isolated. As discussed recently
by Smith & Tombleson [28], the central paradigm of the role that LBVs play in stellar evolution
and their connection to stars with the highest initial masses is probably incorrect, because their
isolation from massive O-type stars dictates that they are largely products of binary evolution
and not a transitional state in the lives of the most massive stars. There are many ways in
which violent binary interaction may be important for understanding LBVs and related transients
[1,28-31], but these are not part of the traditional view. These two aspects are discussed in more
