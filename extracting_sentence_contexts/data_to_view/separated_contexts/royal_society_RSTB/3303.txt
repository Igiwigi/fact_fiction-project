On the other hand Lomax ( : 02) states
definitely that his experience in the mines leads him to believe that “the various
portions of plants have been carried to their present position after being broken in
fragments, and before petrifaction, or they have been carried from a parent bed after
petrifaction,” thus bringing forward an opposing view, which, if proved, would make
it clear that the “coal balls” do not contain representative plants of the coal
in which they are found, but have been derived from another locality, possibly even
from an earlier epoch. It is of prime importance to determine which of these two

views is correct, for upon our interpretation of the facts depend all the theoretical
considerations and the conclusions which are to be drawn from the structures found
in the “ coal balls.” In this present paper we bring forward a series of facts which appear to prove
conclusively that the coal balls do actually represent the flora of the coal in which

they are found, thus supporting the conclusions reached with more scanty evidence
by Hooker and BINNEY. The subject of the coal balls and their structure was discussed at the York
Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1906, when
Professor Werss (:06) contributed a paper dealing with the past work on the subject,
which was followed by one (Stores, :06) giving an account of the work which was
being done at the time. The facts then stated, and the conclusions drawn being
similar to, but less complete than those presented in this paper, no reference to the
York communication is needed here.
