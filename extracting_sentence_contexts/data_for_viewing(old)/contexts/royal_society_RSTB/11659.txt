found. As the collection of the human remains was heavily
damaged during the Second World War, the number of indi-
viduals is rather vague. Based on the surviving collection of
860 bones the MNT is 21, but the real number could originally
have been much higher, possibly up to 50. If correct this would
make the Avelineâ€™s Hole collection the largest sample of human
remains from the early Mesolithic of Europe. The dating of the
assemblage is based on 18 AMS radiocarbon measurements on
17 left ulnae and 1 cranium, therefore representing an MNI of
17 individuals. The dates between 11200 and 10900 cal BP
indicate a use of the cave as a burial place in the transitional
period between Preboreal and early Boreal. This relatively
short time span and the fact that subadult individuals,
especially small children, are underrepresented, could indicate
that the cave was selectively used as a burial place by a larger
group or by several smaller groups over 100 or 200 years.

Similar radiocarbon dates have been found at two skulls
and a mandible from a sandpit at Greylake, Somerset, UK
(table 2). The human remains including postcranial fragments
representing a minimum of five individuals were excavated
in 1928, but dated only recently to the early Boreal. The
facts that skulls and long bones, together with some smaller
skeletal elements were preserved might indicate the presence
of complete burials at the site.
