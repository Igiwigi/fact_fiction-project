Were this a well authenticated fact, I shonld consider it a decisive
proof; but I am doubtful of the fact. I have never heard of sea weed having been
brought up by the lead from great depths in sounding ; in no charts which I have
ever consulted is such bottom noticed. And there are certain facts which are hardly
in accordance with it; such as the state of iron cannon which haye been sunk in
deep water during a long period, and have been converted, as it were, into plumbago;
such as the preservation of wood under sea water for many years, and indeed for

with greatest violence, sandstone barriers are forming from the deposition, amongst
the sand thrown up, of cementing carbonate of lime, set free from its solution by
the disengagement of the carbonic acid gas, owing to the agitation ; 80, in the greatest
depths, deprived of oxygen, vegetable matter may be tranquilly subsiding, and in pro-

maximum density, judging from the formation of peat, appears to be most favourable.
