the centre of inertia from the centre of the ellipsoid; it is duly considered in the
paper, but is shown to vanish to the requisite order of approximation ({§ 2, 14).

The co-ordinates of points are determined by reference to the ellipsoid J, which
envelopes the whole pear, and the formula for the internal gravitation of J, inclusive
of the rotation @, is of a simple character. The size of J is indeterminate, and
therefore the formulze must involve an arbitrary constant expressive of the size of J.
But the final result # cannot in any way depend on the size of the ellipsoid which
is chosen as a basis for measurement, and therefore this arbitrary constant must
ultimately disappear. Hence it is justifiable to treat it as zero from the beginning.
It appears then that we are justified in using the formula for internal gravity
throughout the investigation. If the artifice of the enveloping ellipsoid had not
been adopted, it would have been necessary to take note of the fact that the pear
is in part protuberant above and in part depressed below the ellipsoid of reference.
M. Porncaré did follow this last plan, and then proceeded to prove the justifiability
of using the formula for internal gravity throughout, The argument adduced above
seems, however, sufficient to prove the point.


310 PROFESSOR G. H. DARWIN ON THE STABILITY OF THE PEAR-SHAPED

Although the constant expressive of the size of J is put equal to zero—which
means that the pear is really partly protuberant above the ellipsoid—I have found
that a considerable amount of mental convenience results from always discussing the
subject as though the constant were not zero, so that the ellipsoid envelopes the
