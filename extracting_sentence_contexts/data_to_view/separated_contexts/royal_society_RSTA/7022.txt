The symmetry conditions imply symmetry about the origin. Therefore
S(—%, Ip —2) =f(% 952) (2-2)

After (2-2) the symmetry conditions are easily seen to be equivalent to the invariance of
Runder a rotation of 120° or a reflexion in the line x = z. From this fact it easily follows that

(2:1)

S(%s 2) ts symmetric in all the variables. (23)
It is obviously enough for a full description of R to describe its part in the sector «> 0, 2> 0. It will therefore be supposed in the rest of the section that x>0,2z>0. The convexity condition is equivalent to

S (81 +2 Yt + Y05 21 +22) Sf (5 Ya 21) +A 25 Yos 20) (2-4)
* £ is generated by P and P, or P and P, according as OPP,P, or OPPsP, has area equal to A,
