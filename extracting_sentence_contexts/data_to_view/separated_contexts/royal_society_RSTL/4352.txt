It is given to every
*01 from *00 to 80. The other argument is the © Apparent Azimuth of the Ship's
Head from the Neutral Position,” which is the same as the *apparent azimuth of the
polar magnet” or *azimuth of the polar magnet as measured from the disturbed
position of the compass-needle,” or the angle EBF in fig. 1. This is used as the
argument of the Table, because, in the examination of the disturbance of ships' com-
passes, it is usually most convenient to fix the ship in position by means of its own
compass; and in fact all the observations supplied to me have been made in positions
of the ship s0 determined. As the observations of deviation of ships' compasses are
usually made from © point” to © point ” of azimuth, the diyision of the cirele here
employed is that by points and decimals of a point. The Table is carried to 8 points
only, as the polar-magnet-deviations from 8 to 16 points are the same in reversed
order; and those from 16 to 32 points are the same as those from 0 to 16 points with
change of sign.
