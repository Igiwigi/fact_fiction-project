If the field is changing energy can pass into the conductor, as there may be
temporary E.M.I. set up within it, and there will be transformation. But we already
know the nature of this transformation, for it constitutes the induced current. Tndeed,
the fundamental equation describing the motion of energy is only a deduction from
Maxwerrs equations, which are formed 80 as to express the experimental facts as far
as yet known. Among these are the laws of induction in secondary circuits, and they
must therefore agree with the law of transfer. We can hardly hope, then, for any
further proof of the law beyond its agreement with the experiments already known
until 80me method is discovered of testing what goes on in the dielectric independently
of the secondary circuit.
