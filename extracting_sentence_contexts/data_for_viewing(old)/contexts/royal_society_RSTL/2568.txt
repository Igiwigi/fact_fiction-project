$. 15. On the influence by induction of an Electric Current on itself :—and
on the inductive action of Electric Currents generally.

1048. 'Tur following investigations relate to a very remarkable inductive action
of electric currents, or of the different parts of the same current, and indicate an
immediate connexion between such inductive action and the direct transmission of
electricity through conducting bodies, or even that exhibited in the form of a spark.

1049. The inquiry arose out of a fact communicated to me by Mr. Jexxix, which

is as follows. If an ordinary wire of short length be used as the medium of commu-
nication between the two plates of an electromotor consisting of a single pair of
metals, no management will enable the experimenter to obtain an electric shock from
this wire; but if the wire which surrounds an electro-magnet be used, a shock is
felt each time the contact with the electromotor is broken, provided the ends of the
wire be grasped one in each hand.

1050. Another effect is obseryed at the same time, which has long been known to
philosophers, namely, that a bright electric spark occurs at the place of disjunction.

1051. A brief account of these results, with some of a corresponding character
