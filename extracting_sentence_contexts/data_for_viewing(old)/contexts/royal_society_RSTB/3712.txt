argument is seriously affected. I do not think, however, that the evidence for
regarding them as belonging to the same neuromere is any more convincing than
that for regarding them as belonging to different neuromeres, and, if my suggestion
as to the neuromery is correct, they are actually separated by an intervening
neuromere. We shall have occasion to refer to this question again when we come to
deal with the comparison of the pineal organs with the lateral eyes.

V.—TuHe Pineat Compuex.

Under this heading I propose to describe the minute structure and relations of
those organs which form the main subject of the present memoir, viz., the dorsal

* My attention has been called to the fact that in mammals the recessus geniculorum are said to belong to
the fore-brain. In Sphenodon they certainly appear to belong to the mid-brain (¢f. text-fig. 10), and I
think this view facilitates the interpretation of the neuromery. I have not attempted, any comparison
with the mammalian brain in this respect, and it is, of course, possible that the use of the term recessus
geniculorum for the structures in question in the case of Sphenodon, in which I have followed GisI, will
prove to be unjustifiable, I am indebted to Prof. E:tior Smiru for information on this point.
