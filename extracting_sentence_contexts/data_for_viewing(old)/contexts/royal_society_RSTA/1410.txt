During the earthquake slip, the potential energy (strain energy plus gravitational energy) in Dh
the system, W, drops by AW which can be written as : s

AW=Es +FA+GA, (2.3) ~

where Eg is the energy radiated as seismic waves (and thus the component that can be estimated
from seismic recordings), F is the fictional energy loss per unit area (F = 04S) and G is often
referred to as the fracture energy per unit area. Essentially G accounts for all the energy dissipation
in excess of that in F, probably involving heat as well as creation of new surfaces. It may be more
accurately referred to as the breakdown work [34], and I use the terms interchangeably.

The energy balance is easily interpreted in the simple case shown in figure 2a, often referred to
as the Orowan model [35], in which breakdown work is negligible (G=0), and so
