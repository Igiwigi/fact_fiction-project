marked vortex system, when the intermediate ridge behaves much as a full ridge, as
observed. That the particles which form the intermediate ridge are, in fact, on the
whole smaller than the particles of the main ridges was proved by collecting particles
from both types of ridges when the appearance was as illustrated in fig. 7, Plate 21. As a result of several measurements, the mean diameter of the particles of the main
ridges came out to be 0-071 mm., and of the intermediate ridges 0-054 mm.
