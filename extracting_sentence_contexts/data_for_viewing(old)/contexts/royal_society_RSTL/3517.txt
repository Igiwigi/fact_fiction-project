2014. The displacements appear to be most extraordinary, as extraordinary as those
consequent on dilution (2005.) ; and thus show that there is no general ruling in-
Auence of fluid conductors, or even of acids, alkalies, &c. as distinet; classes of s8uch
conductors, apart from their pure chemical relations. But how can the contact
theory account for these results > To meet such facts it must be bent about in. the

most extraordinary manner, following all the contortions of the string of facts (1874.
1956. 1992. 2006. 2063.), and yet never showing a case of the production of a current
by contact alone, i, e, unaccompanied by chemical action.

2015, On the other hand, how simply does the chemical theory of excitement of
the current represent the facts: as far as we can yet follow them they go hand in
hand. Without chemical action, no current ; with the changes of chemical action,
changes of current ; whilst the influence of the strongest cases of contact, as of silyer
and tin (1997.) with each other, pass for nothing in the resnlt. In further con-
firmation, the exciting power does not rise, but fall, by the contact of the bodies pro-
duced, as the chemical actions producing these decay or are exhausted ; the conse-
quent result being well seen in the effect of the investing fluids produced (1918.
1953. 1966.).
