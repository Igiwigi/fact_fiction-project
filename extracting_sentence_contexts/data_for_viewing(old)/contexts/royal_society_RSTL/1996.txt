evidently be equal to ul I take this opportunity to make
this observation, as algebraists are sometimes not sufficiently
precise in their notation of exponentials.


expressive of the law of human mortality, &c. 519

This equation between the number of the living, and the
age, becomes deserving of attention, not in consequence of its
hypothetical deduction, which in fact is congruous with many
natural effects, as for instance, the exhaustions of the receiver
of an air pump by strokes repeated at equal intervals of time,
but it is deserving of attention, because it appears corrobo-
rated during a long portion of life by experience; as I derive
the same equation from various published tables of mortality
during a long period of man's life, which experience: there-
fore proves that the hypothesis approximates to the law of
mortality during the same portion of life ; and in fact the
hypothesis itself was derived from an analysis of the expe-
rience here alluded to.
