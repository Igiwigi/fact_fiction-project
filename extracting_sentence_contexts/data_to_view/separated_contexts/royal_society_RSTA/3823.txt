On the contrary, the GOS
of the small grains n1 and n2 is low and very low mis2mean values are measured in these grains. Based on the smooth shape of grain boundaries between grain n1 and grain P12, and between
grain n2 and grain P12, we assume the two small grains to have grown at the expense of grain P12. This interpretation is substantiated by the fact that the mis2mean map shows more sub-structures
in the vicinity of the small grains within grain P12 than within grain P11. The pole figure shown in figure 5 represents the orientation of each grain of the figure, with
symbols proportional to the grain size. The orientations of the small grains n1 and n2 are close to
the orientation of grain P11, while the orientation of the small grain r1 is close to grain P12.
