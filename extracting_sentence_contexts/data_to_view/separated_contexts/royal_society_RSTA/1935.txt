Impact of shifted lattices on numerical equilibria-based LBMs
(a) DVMs and adaptive LBMs

In the framework of DVMs, discrete velocities are chosen according to the flow conditions in
order to ensure the stability of the method. This is done by satisfying the following requirements
in terms of flow velocity ug [29]

and temperature T

Interestingly, the condition (C 1) translates to the fact that information cannot propagate at a speed
below the smallest discrete velocity of the lattice, and above the maximal one—this condition
is more commonly known as the (Courant, Friedrichs et Lewy) CFL condition. Similarly, the
condition (C 2) translates to the fact that the temperature is bounded by the minimal and maximal
internal energies of discrete velocities. Observing a lower limit for the temperature might be
surprising at first, but in fact, this is exactly what is observed during simulations of both DVMs
and LBMs (figures 1 and 2).
