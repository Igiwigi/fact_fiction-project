stress conditions will not worsen in water-limited regions where models predict precipitation to
decrease or remain unchanged and where ET is not expected to decrease due to the significant
rise in AED predicted by the simulations. In these regions, although ET will not change given soil
moisture limitations, AED will undoubtedly increase plant water stress.

It is necessary to stress that the effect of a CO2 on leaf stomatal conductance is still
affected by strong uncertainties and influenced by other factors, including the radiative
effects of CO, [61]. Moreover, ESMs show substantial overestimation of this effect [102] that
could bias drought estimations based on metrics that include ET or soil moisture, but also
metrics based on AED and precipitation could be affected by land-atmosphere feedbacks.
Thus, ET limitation by increased a CO contradicts observations since ET has increased in
the last few decades [103], a period characterized by a high increase in a COz; there are
also studies supporting the fact that ET has been primarily driven by climate trends, with
only a minor role played by a CO [104]. Moreover, climate warming may have an impact
on plant processes that are not included in ESMs, such as water loss from leaf cuticule
[105,106], which is independent of stomatal responses to a CO). Finally, land use and vegetation
changes severely affect land transpiration, and these are either highly uncertain in current
ESMs (e.g. the leaf area index [107]) or not included [108]. All of these processes mean
that evaluating future drought projections based on metrics using ESM simulations of ET
should be approached with caution [61], and this caution should also affect soil moisture and
runoff.

Some authors have suggested that including AED in drought severity metrics could
overestimate agricultural and ecological and hydrological drought projections, particularly in
water-limited regions [96], based on the fact that AED is higher than ET in these regions.
