with an apparatus fitted up by Mr. SHaw. In order to 8ee whether a different regult
might nob be obtained with other mercury, s0me was procured from the chemical
laboratory for measurements 10 and 14. For the latter a portion of this mercury was
treated with nitric acid and distilled at atmospheric pressure. For measurement 10
it was treated with nitric acid, but not distilled. An accident occurred in carrying out
this measurement, 80 that only the resistance of the column was ascertained ; but this
agrees 80 well with the resistances found with the same tube for the other mercury,
that there is no reason to suppose that any discrepancy would have appeared in
proceeding with the meagurement further.

The glass tubes used were supplied by CASSELLA, and were elected for uniformity
of bore, 80 that the correction for conicality should be small. They were slender and
easily broken, which made the manipulation of them difficult, and it was in fact owing
to a breakage that the tube called No. I. was used 80 short. The measurements
taken with it, a firs intended to be preliminary, were, however, made with the
same care as in the case of the other tubes, and the difference of length and resistance
adds some variety to the data. Tubes II. and IIT, were cub 80 thab their resistance
8hould be as nearly as possible one B.A. unit. The section of tubes I., IT., and III,
was approximately 1 square millimetre, Tube IV. was a much larger one, introduced
with a view of varying the data as much as could conveniently be done. The diameter
of its bore was about 2 millims., and its length was nearly 2 metres. It was cut 80 as
to give a resistance of about half a B.A. unit.

The ends of the tubes were ground into a convex form with emery powder on a
lathe, in order that the length (L) of the bore might be measured accurately. This
