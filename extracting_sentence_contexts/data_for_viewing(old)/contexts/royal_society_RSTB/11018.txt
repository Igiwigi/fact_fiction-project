zation. This is achieved by a transient increase in copy
number of the virulence plasmid pIBX, which carries the
T3SS, from 1 to 3 per cell [114]. Aureimonas species carry plas-
mid-borne ribosomal RNA genes, potentially enabling rapid
change in copy number which might provide selective benefit
under changing environmental conditions [115].

Plasmid maintenance in a species, through amelioration
or infectious transfer, may resonate through a community.
In species-rich microbial communities, a subset of members
able to maintain plasmids may act as a ‘source’ species for
otherwise unfavourable hosts [107], a pattern that is reflected
in the fact that the ability of a plasmid to invade a microbial
community is correlated with existing plasmid maintenance
[116]. Plasmids can still conjugate from hosts that have com-
pletely ameliorated their cost [96], and the ability of a plasmid
to invade a diverse fraction of a community [117] means that
a few source species could maintain community-wide gene
mobility.

7. The impacts of horizontal gene transfer on
genome evolution

Genes can be rapidly lost as well as gained, and gene loss fre-
quently acts to pare down bacterial genomes [118]. This
