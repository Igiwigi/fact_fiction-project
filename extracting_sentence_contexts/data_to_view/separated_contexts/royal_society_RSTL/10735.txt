have as
long as certain other units remain identically-correspondent. 127. Since we can in all cases ignore differences, any system S may be regarded as
a single heap, the peculiarities of form which ib possesses in any particular investiga-
tion being regarded as due to the fact that we are not considering S alone, but in
conjunetion with other units, those correspondences only of $ being dealt with which
admit of the additional units remaining identically-correspondent. All statements,
therefore, as to the distinguishableness and undistinguishableness of components of 8,
and as to their being of particular forms may be taken as relative, viz., as statements
that the components have the correspondences characteristic of those forms as long as
certain units detached from S remain identically-correspondent. 128, It may be laid down generally, that in almost every instance where we seem
to investigate a base system S which may be regarded and spoken of as being of
n units and of a particular form, we really deal with a single heap system H of
1 units and a system F which remains identically-correspondent while the units of H
go through the correspondences characteristic of the system S.
