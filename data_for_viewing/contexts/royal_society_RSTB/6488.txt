ridges, while fine particles are found within the grooves or in the act of descending into
them. The only region where fine or coarse particles accumulate is in the head of the
caecum, where they form a compact bolus.

Thus all particles entering the caecum must be passing up to the head along the
tops of the ridges and in the grooves. All the series of sections examined gave per-
fectly consistent evidence for these deductions.

Movement of Particles in the Gut—I1. By Muscular Contraction of the Walls

The oesophagus and hindgut of Jorunna lie relatively free within the body cavity,
the only attachment to surrounding organs is by thin mesenteries of connective
tissue. This fact has considerable significance, since it admits of the possibility of
peristalsis, or some similar muscular movement of the gut wall, playing a part in the
transference of particles.

The possible existence of such a mechanism is confirmed by the fact that if the
oesophagus, or hindgut, be removed by dissection and examined in sea water, they
undergo vigorous writhing movements due to muscular contraction of their walls.
In addition, occasional waves of contraction, possibly comparable to the peristaltic
contraction of the gut of vertebrates, may be observed in the excised pieces of gut. It
appears that the movements are under nervous control since they may be accentuated
by pricking the gut wall with some such sharp instrument as a dissecting needle,
though whether these movements exhibit the characteristics of the true peristalsis of
the vertebrate intestine, and whether therefore they should be termed bona fide
