During the season 1864-65 the nebula was often examined with the view of verifying
the drawing made by Mr. HuyTER, and in 1865-66 s8ome additions were made to it in
the neighbourhood of the stars 1,,, 2, 3, 4, 1,u, 2, 9, 27,, 45, (Plate 11.); also the
positions of a few stars not given in STruyE's list were determined by rough microme-
trical measurement, and others were laid down by eye-estimation. During the season
1866-67 these measures were completed, the additions of the previous season verified,
and the drawing, extended to the neighbourhood of the stars 1,, 0,.,, 0, 46,, 99, 143,
149, and 147. The facts which seem to be of the most interest have been collected under the fol-
lowing heads :—
