Further investigation, both with regard to the con
nexions of these vessels, and to their prevalence amongst the Nematoids generally, would
be most desirable. THE RESPIRATORY FUNCTIION—HOW PERFORMED ? Amonegst the lower Invertebrata it is a well-known fact that the function of respiratiol
is effected by the most dissimilar means, and often by distinct processes working inde-
pendently in the same animal towards the fulfilment of a similar end. We need nob
be surprised therefore if 81ch is found to be the case amongst the Nematoids. It is
however, rather remarkable that cilia, which often (as first pointed out by Dr. SHaraY ®)
play 80 important a part in the respiratory processes of the invertebrate animals, should
never yet have been detected in any Nematoid either parasitic or free.
