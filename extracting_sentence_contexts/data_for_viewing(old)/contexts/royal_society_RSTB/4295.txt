lividus are fertilised, there is distinct evidence that the egg is compressed by the
contents of the perivitteline space, and the phenomenon is very marked if a large
amount of sperm is present. Within a few minutes, however, the egg resumes its
normal spherical shape, if the excess of sperm is removed. It is impossible to
measure the diameter of the eggs when in the contracted state on account of the
irregular outline of the egg surface, but all measurements of eggs which have
resumed their spherical condition have failed to show any diminution of volume
after fertilisation. It is possible that the loss of this contraction or compression of
the egg after fertilisation may account for the slight fall in the conductivity which is
sometimes observed between 3 and 10 minutes after fertilisation.

That the decrease in the resistance of the eggs after fertilisation is not due toa
decrease in their volume is apparent from the following facts :â€”

(a) Microscopical measurements failed to reveal any decrease in the size of
Echinus eggs after fertilisation. This result was also arrived at independently by
Loxs, McLenvon (38), and CHEvRETON and Vues (6), for the eggs of other species.

(b) Although the decrease in the volume of Asterias eggs is much larger than that
of Arbacia and other Echinoid eggs (GLASER, 13), the change in the resistance of
Asterias eggs is much less than that of all the Echinoids investigated.

Direct experiment showed that the currents used to measure the electrical
resistance were wholly without effect upon the subsequent course of development.
