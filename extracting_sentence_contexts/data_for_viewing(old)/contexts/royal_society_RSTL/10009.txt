sent through every 3 or 5 seconds with the secondary coil carefully regulated 80 as just
to give a contraction at every shock, T could find no evidence whatever that a weaker
stimulus was sufficient to produce contractions sgynchronous with the stimuli, even
after a length of time much greater than is ever seen between the time of tightening
the clamp and the recommencement of spontaneous beats.

For these different reasons, then, it is most probable that the compression of the
clamp does not alter the rhythm of the ventricle by lowering the excitability of its
muscular tissve, and we may infer that the same conelusion holds good in reference to
the effect of heating the auricles and sinus. Another explanation must therefore be
found.

Since the experiments of Marey and others it is recognised as a fact that every
contraction of the ventricle is accompanied by a marked diminution of the excitability
of the muscle, 80 that if minimal stimuli be applied to the ventricle at too rapid a rate
the muscle will not be able to contract to each stimulus, because it has not had time
to recover sufficiently from the loss of excitability caused by the previous contraction.
For this reason, then, we can conceive that auy influence like heating the auricles and

sinus only, which causes the motor ganglia to send out impulses at a much quicker
rate without increasing the excitability of the ventricle, may canse the ventricle to
respond synchronously to every second of these quicker impulses, instead of to every
