For \4922 is reduced from 65 to 5'3. 24388 is even more reduced from
4°5 to 3°5, and \4144 from 1‘1 to 0’°7. In fact each is reduced relatively to all its
predecessors in the series. We are in this case dealing with a phenomenon of a
different type to that caused by variation of pressure, and as suggested in connection
with Diffuse Helium, we prefer to restrict the term “ energy-transfer” to cases in
which the change of intensity of a line is greater than, or less than, the change in all
its predecessors in the series. The effect of a large admixture of Hydrogen is again, as in Helium, directly
contrary to the effect of a small trace just discussed.
