If the cylinder be now pressed down or pulled up, it returns
to its position of equilibrium when the added force ceases to act (XT, 225, TX, 9). For each load there is therefore a value of h, the distance between cylinder and
plate, at which the capillary pressure is equal to the loading, and this value is constant
for all fluids including clean air, and for different solids when the solid faces are clean,
but seems to be exceedingly sensitive to errors in the shape of the surface (XI, 274). The capillary pressure we have called the Leslie pressure (LX, 10).t

The most difficult problem of the boundary state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will float in
air over & plane solid surface at a distance which may be as much as 0-007 mm., is independent within
the limits of accuracy of the method of measurement of the solids (steel and glass were tried), and is
unchanged when air is replaced by a liquid (see also p. 36). There must be either an excess of hydrostatic pressure between the faces to support the load or the
support is furnished by solid particles adhering to the faces. That the air gap is due to a true capillary pressure and not to solid particles is inferred from the
facts.
