times its weight of pure nitric acid, sp. gr. 1'2, m well-stoppered 300 cubic centimetre
bottles, and heated to about 40Â® C. until all the silver had dissolyed. After cooling, the
bulb containing the weighed quantity of yanadyl trichloride was brought into the bottle,
the bottle closed, and the bulb broken by shaking ; distilled water was then added, 80
that the weight of the whole liquid amounted to from forty to fifty times that of the
silyer employed. The lower oxides of nitrogen present in solution in the acid reduced
the vanadium to a bright blue solution, in which the slightest turbidity of silver chlo-
ride could be well seen.

In the volumetric determination of chlorine it has already been noticed, both by Gay-
Txs84c and STas, that when one or two milligrammes of silyer per litre still remain in
s80lution, a turbidity is produced by the addition of both silyer and chloride s0lution.
This fact was also observed in the yolumetric analyses of yanadyl trichloride; and in
order to render the results comparable, the course proposed by STas was inyariably
adopted, yiz. that of adding the decimal chloride solution until all turbidity ceased.
The error thus introduced is, however, extremely small (less than 0:0005), and is coun-
terbalanced by the error arising from a trace of impurity contained in the silyer.

In seyeral cases the vanadium in the filtrate was estimated by precipitating the excess
of silyer, expelling the acid by eyaporation, again filtering from the trace of siver
chloride which separates out, and eyaporating the filtrate to dryness in porcelain, trans-
ferring to platinum, oxidizing by nitric acid, and weighing the fused acid.
