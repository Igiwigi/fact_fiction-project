Cis thus more marked, and the interdependence of the two values also more evident.
Z In the case of Spherechinus, the relation also shows itself. Thus, in one of the three
experiments made on December 13, the ova were about 7 per cent. smaller than in
the other two, whilst the larve arising therefrom were about 12 per cent. smaller.
Also on dividing up the values into two groups, it is found that ova with an average
diameter of 11°33, produce larvee averaging 17°10 in body-length, and ova of 11°72
larvee of 17°67. We see, therefore, that in every case the average values for the size
of ova and of larve more or less correspond ; but as the individual values show con-

iderable variations, there are obviously other factors at work as well.

With reference to the two values for Echinocardiuny ova, it will be noticed that
that of E. mediterraneum is considerably less (10°7 per cent. in fact) than that of
E. cordatum, the five days’ plutei being also 11:2 per cent. less in body-length. Now

the extreme limit of variation in any of the other measurements of ova was only
8°9 per cent. Hence an additional argument is afforded in favour of the specifie
difference of these two Echinoids.

General Conclusions.
