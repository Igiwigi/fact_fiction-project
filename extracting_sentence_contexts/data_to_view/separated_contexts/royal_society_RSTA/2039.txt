From a theoretical point of view, the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the
diluted and structured magnetic composite must correspond to whole cylinders without the
central cavity. However, non-equilibrium structures, which stably exist for a long time, have
been observed. A critical issue that has not been addressed in the above-mentioned studies, is
the fact the rheological properties of the carrier medium are changing during polymerization
together with a change in a compositeâ€™s microstructure. The process of polymerization of silicone
composites is initiated by the addition of a chemical catalyst and actually begins before the
magnetic field for structuring the powder particles has been applied. Thus, in this case, it is
inappropriate to speak about targeted and precisely controlled structuring of composites.
