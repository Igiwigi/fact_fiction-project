ratio trial/participants per se should not present a big chal-
lenge to compare results from human and monkey studies
(but note that ergodicity does not seem to be granted for
psychological processes, see [57]). However, in addition to
these quantitative differences, in monkey studies, an outcome
(usually a primary reward) is provided on a trial-by-trial basis.
This is because a monkey would simply stop doing the
experiment in the absence of extrinsic motivation. Thus, in vir-
tually all cases monkey experiments include a reinforcement
learning component, where actions are associated with past
outcomes. This is true even when the paradigm involves
establishing a symbolic system to communicate outcomes
and probabilities. In fact, in the absence of a shared language
or semantic system to communicate, monkeys are compel-
led to learn any representational system by trial-and-error
from feedback.

In the present article, we argue that the above-mentioned
differences do not only present a technical issue, but also a
major epistemological challenge for the (strong) neuroeconomic
agenda. We detail why below.

As mentioned before, foundational contributions to behav-
ioural decision-making research were made through the use
of explicitly described gambles. Several representations have
