MY DEAR SIR,

Tr is well known that the fluid, generally called the Sap in
trees, ascends in the spring and summer from their roots,
and that in the autumn and winter it is not, in any considerable
quantity, found in them; and I have observed in a former
Paper, that this fluid rises wholly through the alburnum, or
sap-wood. But Du Hawsr and subsequent naturalists have
proved, that trees contain another kind of sap, which they
have called the true, or peculiar juice, or sap of the plant.
Whence this fluid originates does not appear to have been
agreed by naturalists ; but I have offered some facts to prove
that it is generated by the leaf;* and that it differs from the
common aqueous sap owing to changes it has undergone in its
circulation through that organ : and I have contended that from
this fluid (which Du HamtrL has called the $c propre, and
which I will call the true sap,) the whole substance, which is
annually added to the tree, is derived. I shall endeavour in
the present Paper to prove that this fluid, in an inspissated
state, or some concrete matter deposited by it, exists during
