straight elongated forms; and they are also better adapted to membranes having unequal
surfaces, such as those in Microciona armata, BowERBANK, MS., where we see them
following the undulations of the membranes and sustaining them in their proper positions
around the columnar parts of the skeletons. The yarieties of form in these spicula are well
represented by figs. 26, 27, & 28, Plate XXIV. Phil. 'Trans. 1858. They are all out of
the same sponge. In Grantia compressa, and other closely allied species, where the
structure is systematically membranous, the skeleton spicula are triradiate, supporting
the membranes in uniform planes in the most effectual manner ; and they are, in fact,
systematically tension spicula, as well as skeleton ones. In Grantia nivea, JOANSTON,
which is not symmetrical in its structure like &. compress@ and its congeners, other
D forms of tension spicula are developed to suit their especial purposes, such as represented

Â® In siliceous sponges we also occasionally find triradiate spicula developed, and per-
