It may, perhaps, be permitted to make another suggestion
here. Even if, as is usually accepted, the protoplasm of the root-hairs of plants
cultivated in nutritive solutions—and, if so, presumably of plants in soil—is confined
to the interior of the cell-walls, these cell-walls are very thin and delicate. There
are facts which seem to support the view that the germinal hypha starts its course at
the root-hairs for this reason, and it is not impossible that the gemmules will only
germinate on the root-hairs of the host-plants. At any rate, I never find them
elsewhere. It is a well-known and very popular view that the Leguminose enrich the soil in
nitrogenous substances.
