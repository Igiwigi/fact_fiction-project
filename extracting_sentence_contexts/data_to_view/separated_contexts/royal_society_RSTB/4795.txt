as to their extreme rarity are correct I do not think we are at all likely in any near future
to obtain direct information as to their nature. The whole scheme has therefore, I
think justifiably, been simplified to the greatest possible extent to enable us to get a
first notion, in quantitative terms, of the possible consequences of the conceptions, and
to compare them as far as possible with the facts. I will now endeavour to summarise the conclusions reached in general terms which
I hope may be comprehensible to the non-mathematical biologist. The conclusions
result, of course, from the assumptions, and simply exhibit their consequences.
