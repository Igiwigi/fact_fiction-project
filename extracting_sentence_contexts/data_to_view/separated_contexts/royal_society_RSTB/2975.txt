(4) The fact that the flow of water through short lengths of stem under pressure
or suction is always less than would be expected from a viscosity calculation, and not
greater, as might be expected if any pumping action were at work. (5) The fact that, ceteris paribus, the flow is as rapid up a stem as down it. (6) The fact that Srraspurcer* has found that long lengths of stem (often
12 metres) remain capable of conducting sufticient water to keep the upper parts
fresh for several days after the stem has been killed by heat or poison, and that the
conductivity may be temporarily restored by injection with water. With regard to this last objection, the mere fact that the trunk and branches of a
tree when saturated, may contain sufficient available water for a few days to two or
three weeks’ average transpiration, suffices to show that SrRASBURGER’S experiments
have by no means the finality usually ascribed to them. Further, there is no
disputing the fact that the leaves may exercise an osmotic suction upon the water in

the vessels, which will be proportional to the difference of concentration in the two
cases, less the minimum amount required to maintain turgidity in the leaf (over three
atmospheres).
