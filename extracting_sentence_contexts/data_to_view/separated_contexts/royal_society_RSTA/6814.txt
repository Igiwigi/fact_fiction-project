P. WHIPPLE ON THE

appropriate reflexion coeflicient is the one which we have called #,,, and we shall write
¢ —argR,,. If ¢ is independent of the angle 0, we may describe the experimental results
in terms of a fictitious horizonal reflector. If, however, ¢ depends on @, we must explain the
results in terms either of a reflector whose height, or whose phase-shift, depends on 0. Equation (10-3) gives the relative phase of the reflected vertical component of the field;

for brevity denote arg E, by y.
