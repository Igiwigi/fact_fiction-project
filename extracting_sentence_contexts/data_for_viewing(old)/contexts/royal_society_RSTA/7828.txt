UPON A STRATIFIED DOUBLY REFRACTING IONOSPHERE 439

it is to calculate the critical electron densities required for reflexion of the extraordinary
and ordinary waves from the values x, and x, of x, and not x, and x,. In the case of the
ordinary wave in fig. 16 the electron density corresponding to the point B is about 18 %
greater than that corresponding to the point £; it is about 60 °%, greater than it would be
in the absence of the earth’s magnetic field, when the critical electron density would be
given by x = C? = }. The corresponding percentages for the ordinary wave in fig. 15
are 5% and 30%, the influence of the earth’s magnetic field being less for the higher
frequency. We notice that the discrepancy between the electron density for which the
direction of group-propagation becomes horizontal and the electron density for which
the direction of phase-propagation becomes horizontal is less marked for the extra-
ordinary wave than for the ordinary wave. This can be connected up with the fact

that the critical electron density required to reflect the ordinary wave in the case of
vertical incidence at a magnetic pole differs from what it is in the case of vertical inci-
dence at the magnetic equator, whereas the critical electron density required to reflect
the extraordinary wave is the same in both cases.
