of Platinum-salt . . . . . . 37718 100-00

The percentage of the platinum is unusually low when compared with the theore-
tical value, a fact which I suppose is due to the recrystallization of the salt. In
several cases I have observed that the platinum-salts of these bases undergo a slight
decomposition under these circumstances, which is not indicated by the appearance
of the recrystallized salt, but which is invariably pointed out by a diminution of the
amount of platinum. I am not as yet acquainted with the mode of this change.
