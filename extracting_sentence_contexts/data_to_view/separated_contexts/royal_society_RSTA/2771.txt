Let a ray

y = Bx+b, z= yxte,
in the original medium be transformed by refraction at the surface into
y = Baâ€™ +0, 2 =y2'+e',
where the axes are, in fact, the same but are accented to indicate the difference of
medium. The positive direction of the x-axis is that in which the light is travelling. MR. R. A. SAMPSON:
