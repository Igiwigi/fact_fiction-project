of amitosis. It is interesting to note that abnormal behaviour of the nucleolus giving the
impression of an amitotic division has been found in amoebae belonging to both the
families Schizopyrenidae and Hartmannellidae.

Critical remarks
Goodey (1916) described Amoeba agricola n.sp. from one of his cultures made from stored
Hoosfield soil at Rothamsted. He says (p. 325): ‘It exhibits some rather remarkable

appearances during the division of the nucleus, which seems to differ from any of the
already described nuclear divisions in amoebae; and it is on the strength of this fact that
I propose the creation of a new species for its reception.’

The amoeba just described resembles Goodey’s amoeba in several respects. It has no
distinction between ectoplasm and endoplasm, and during nuclear division it retains its
irregular appearance as was clearly pointed out by Goodey (1916). Moreover, it tends to
divide abnormally, and this tendency would probably have been increased in the cultural
conditions used by Goodey, since these were not standardized. I have therefore felt
justified in applying the specific name agricola to this form. Goodey’s organism belongs
to the genus Hartmannella, because had there been the formation of ‘polar masses’ during
nuclear division he would certainly have noted it.
