nucleus during the greater part of its existence, and the microspheric form numbers of
Comparatively small nuclei.

Some of the apparently contradictory statements may probably thus be reconciled.


414. MR. J. J. LISTER ON THE LIFE-HISTORY OF THE FORAMINIFERA.

Thus, in Zextularia, while Max Scnutrze and Birscutt find two, three, or me
nuclei, R. Herrwie finds a single one. From BirscHutâ€™s figures it appears
he was dealing with microspherie forms.
The frequent occurrence of a single nucleus in the genera which have been examined
is in harmony with the fact that the megalospheric form usually far outnumbers the
microspheric. It is probable, however, that the nuclear history differs to some extent
in different groups of Foraminifera. It may also be observed that, as I shall show
presently in the case of Polystomella, bodies which I believe to be formed in the
elaboration of the food may possess staining properties and be thus readily mistake
for nuclei.
In Rotalina and Globigerina, Herrwic describes the nuclei as consisting of two
parts, of which one is granular and takes the stain, and the other is clear and
homogeneous. SCHULZE, however, states that the nucleus of Rotalina, as seen b
him, resembles that of Polystomella, and this is also true of Rotalina Becca
(figs. 39 and 40). In Polystomella, an appearance somewhat resembling that whi
Hertwic describes is sometimes presented when a vacuolar space, probably resulting
from the action of the reagents, lies alongside the nucleus.
