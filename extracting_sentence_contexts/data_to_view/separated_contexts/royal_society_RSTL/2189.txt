Hence it is obvious, that in the first of these cases the com-
position of a substance may be determined by simply ascer-
taining the quantity of carbonic acid gas yielded by a known
quantity of it; while in the other two, the same can be readily
ascertained by means of the same data, and by noting the
excess or diminution of the original bulk of the oxygen gas
employed. Such are the simple and universally admitted

amount of :03 gr. though often much less than this. I was a good deal puzzled to
account for this anomaly at first, but believe that it arose chiefly from the reoxy-
dation of the partially reduced oxide, by the air of the atmosphere, G

Since this Paper was read before the Royal Society, I have observed one or two
other singular facts connected with this subject, which will be noticed when we
come to speak of the analysis of substances containing azote.

principles in which the following method of analysis' is
founded ; the only novelty in which, therefore, is the form of
the apparatus ; and of this it is hoped the following summary
sketch, and annexed figures, will convey every requisite
information,

Fig. 1, Plate XIV, represents a front view or elevation of
thewhole apparatus in the act of being employed. ABlis a plat-
form, two feet square, surrounded by a ledge about 2+ inches
high, for preserving any mercury that may chance to fall
about, and furnished with four adjusting screws ( of which two,
CC, are sectional views), by means of which it may be placed
perfectly horizontal, Into this platform, in the manner repre-
sented, are fixed perpendicularly four square pillars, DE, DE,
about four feet and a half high, at the top of which is placed
another small platform, FF, about four inches wide, and
which may be fixed or removed at pleasure by means of the
brass pins ab, ab. II are glass tubes graduated with the
utmost care to hundredths of a cubic inch, and which are
cemented at bottom into semicircular iron tubes enclosed in
the blocks K K (as represented by the dotted lines).
