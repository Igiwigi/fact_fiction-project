The RU30 (Seismic Remote Unit
3kg) was a reduced functional engineering model version of the RU10 (Seismic Remote unit
10kg), which was focused on unifiable components, while the RU30 was required by ROBEX to
deploy the passive seismic array triangle in approximately the same dimensions as the previous
version of Apollo 17. The Etna site was chosen as ideal, since regular seismic events due to tectonic
movements in this region are happening in a focal deep depth of approximately 600 km, which is
similar to the depth of deep lunar quakes observed during the Apollo mission. Furthermore, the
seismic activity is unique due to the fact of being on an active volcano with continuous tremor
activity and its location on tectonic borders. Moreover, the site provides fresh volcanic regions
with geological highly interesting features and diverse regions with different soil and surface
shapes, which make Mt Etna ideal for exploration testing missions.

(c) Lessons learnt

The previous sections described briefly the idea of modular scientific payload carriers and robotic
modules used in different missions and analogue field tests. Especially in the preparation and
retrospective of the past ROBEX, the analogue campaign has produced a large number of findings
and lessons.
