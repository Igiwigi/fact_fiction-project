Returning now to the expression (6.03) for Ag, it will be seen that the ratio d/R,
occurs in every term, either in the factor e or in L,,. The terms containing e are small

compared with the terms which give rise to the terms 0-00056 (Cea

we are only considering at present the range of value of u for which this is small compared

with 0-0571 (ez. i), it follows that all the terms in e can be neglected. The correction
ry

to the expression (7.10) due to the fact that d/R, is not indefinitely small therefore
appears in the analysis only as a change in the values of the terms L,, ; and in these
terms it always appears as a correction to be subtracted from the factor ite. This

correction may be divided into two parts.

(a) The part d/2R, which is the same for all values of m, and (b) the part — ;
which becomes very small when m is large, but amounts to } of d/2R, form=1. If
the second part (6) did not exist, then evidently the approximate root of A, = 0 given

by (7.10) would still apply if a ets were substituted for 11H,
