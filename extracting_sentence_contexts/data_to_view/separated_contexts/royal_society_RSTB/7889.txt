Amoroso é¢ al. do not describe the histological
condition of the individual corpora lutea of the mare’s ovary during the period concerned,
and whether or not these accessory corpora lutea of pregnancy can be distinguished from
each other, or, as it were, ‘aged’ histologically, appears not to have been investigated as
yet. These authors, however, found one or more ova in the Fallopian tubes of nine out of
fourteen mares killed between the 46th and 73rd day of pregnancy, so that, in some cases
at least, it must have been possible to distinguish the newest of the accessory corpora lutea
from the remainder. The corresponding stages of pregnancy in the elephant are fairly well
represented in the present material, and the fact that in no case could a clear histological
distinction be seen between the several active corpora lutea in a pair of ovaries very strongly
suggests that they were formed not over an extensive, but over a restricted period of time. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the number of active corpora lutea was not
found to increase with successive stages of pregnancy during this phase. All the corpus
luteum formation which will occur in the earlier months of pregnancy has in fact been
accomplished by the earliest stage represented in the available material (E25).
