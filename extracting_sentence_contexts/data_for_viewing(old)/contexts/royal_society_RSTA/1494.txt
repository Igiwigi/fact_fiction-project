These limitations of ISM could perhaps be addressed by the use of Bessel beam illumination
(but at the expense of some 3D imaging performance) [70], combined with radially polarized
illumination to decrease the cross-polarization in the focal region, and by multifocal illumination


[57]. The main advantage of ISM over SIM is the optical sectioning property, which allows ISM to
penetrate better through thick specimens. As Gustafsson says about SIM [48]:

‘It is, however, possible to achieve lateral resolution well beyond the classical limit without
discarding any emission light, namely by using laterally structured illumination in a wide-field,
non-confocal microscope.’

The fact that no emission light is discarded results in a stronger signal, but it should be
appreciated that, the pinhole in a confocal microscope or the finite size of the detector array in
ISM, are the reason for the optical sectioning property, i.e. optical sectioning is achieved because
light is discarded.
