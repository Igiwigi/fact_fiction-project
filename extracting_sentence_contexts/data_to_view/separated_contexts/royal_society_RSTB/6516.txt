This is done by the retention as functional
structures of the dorsal parts of the small opercula (the homologues of the flaps in
Scyllium, which become the frills of Clamydoselache) on the hyoidean and branchial
arches. Each of these structures is provided with a bony skeleton, which ceases
abruptly where it is overlapped by the main mandibular operculum. In fact Climatius
reticulatus gives us for the first time a stage in the evolution of an operculate fish in
which a relic of the Elasmobranch condition of the gill slits is still preserved. The lateral-line of the body is represented by a groove which runs between two
opposed rows of scales. This line continues along the free margin of the scaled area
above the gill chamber and extends forward over the gill region to the patch of
enlarged bones above and behind the eye.
