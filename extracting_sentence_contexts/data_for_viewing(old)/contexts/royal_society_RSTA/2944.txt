Both static and travelling breather solutions have been found numerically in system (1.3) [32-34].
It is, therefore, not surprising that for finite values of w, the model (1.2) admits a rich variety
of localized solutions, namely solitary waves [35], weakly non-local solitary waves or nanoptera
[26,35-37], long-lived static breathers [38] and travelling breathers (figure 1b).

The analytical study of static and travelling breathers in systems (1.2) and (1.3) is quite delicate.
Owing to the lack of smoothness (for p= 5/2) and strongly nonlinear character of the Hertzian
interaction potential, classical approaches based on spatial centre manifold reduction [39] or NLS
reduction [17,18] do not apply. In addition, it has been proved it [38] that exact time-periodic
breathers do not exist in system (1.2) (i.e. without precompression of the chain), despite the fact
that similar excitations can persist over long (but finite) times.

An interesting insight into the dynamics of systems (1.2) and (1.3) can be obtained through
the analysis of a spatially discrete modulation equation, namely the discrete p-Schrédinger (DpS)
equation introduced in [32]. This model reads
