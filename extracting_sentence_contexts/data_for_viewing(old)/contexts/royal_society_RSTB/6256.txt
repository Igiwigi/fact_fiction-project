THE SILURIAN OF VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA 131

or concavities in the case of the corresponding counterparts, and have clearly defined
margins. Typical examples are shown in figs. 6 and 7, Plate 10. In the specimen
represented in fig. 8, Plate 10, a single reniform body with circular depressions is
attached by a stalk to a stouter axis that apparently continued farther, but no
grouping of these structures into fertile spikes has been seen. The tubercles vary
both in number and size. There is some reason to think that the tuberculate surface
of the cast is not the true outer surface of the reniform body and that, if this had been
exposed, the tubercles would not have appeared upon it. A thin dark layer that did
not show tubercles externally was removed from one specimen ; the surface then
exposed showed small circular depressions, while the inner side of the flake of dark
material had corresponding elevations. It is a significant fact also that tubercles
are not evident along the convex margin in any specimen. The question of the
nature of the tubercles cannot be settled satisfactorily from the present material.
There is no evidence that they represent contents such as large spores.

This type of fossil is at present insufficiently understood. The general form closely
resembles that of isolated sporangia of Zosterophyllum australianum, as described from
the Centennial Beds, but the tuberculate surface is a distinct point of difference. It
is nevertheless most naturally tentatively compared with isolated sporangia of
Kosterophyllum and may possibly, when further known, prove to belong to another
species of this genus.
