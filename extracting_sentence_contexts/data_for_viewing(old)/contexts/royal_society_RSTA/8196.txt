We now fix our attention on a small element (or particle) of our solid body surrounding
the point P, and of mass dm.j We denote the energy of the particle of mass dm at P

* Toriginally worked out the theory for the case of body forces (e.g., gravitational field) and body moments
(e.g., magnetised body in a magnetic field), in which it is also necessary to consider an initial stress. The
consequent complications are of no more particular interest in a theory of visco-elasticity than in the theory
of perfect elasticity ; and the equations of motion and expressions for the stress at the free surface of a
solid, obtained in the case of no field of force, still hold—as approximations—in the case of a field of force
and initial stress.

{ In Love's * Elasticity ” an element of certain volume in the standard configuration is considered for
purposes of energy definition. Though physically the same, slight mathematical differences result. The
fact that the surface integral on p. 93 is taken over the surface of the solid in the standard configuration
implies a definition of stress with reference to the standard configuration, which prevents the stress-

components from being components of a tensor, (All references to Love's “ Elasticity ” refer to 4th ed.
(Cambridge, 1927).)

that the dimensions of the element are large compared with molecular dimensions, we
can split the energy up into kinetic energy (of molar motion) and the remainder, which
