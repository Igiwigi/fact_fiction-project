Some other clever experiments challenged the possibility that some
superluminal influences could explain away the non-local quantum correlations [13-16]. Such
superluminal influences could even be excluded theoretically under the assumption that one
cannot signal faster than light at the macroscopic level [17]. Hence, today, quantum non-locality is
a fact: Nature is able to produce random events that can manifest themselves at several locations,
as we like to phrase it. Another (provocative?) sentence is: Quantum non-local correlations
emerge, somehow, from outside space-time in the sense that no story in space-time can tell how
they happen [13,17,18]. That is enough for conceptual physics; let us look at the other aspects of
non-locality.!
