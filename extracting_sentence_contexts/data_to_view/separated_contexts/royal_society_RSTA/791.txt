composition. In the o,-oz composition, however, the time of extrema t = 2/2 of the pure oy case
is retained. The overall similarity of the combined two Pauli case Hamiltonians is due to the fact
that, in such combinations, there will always be a counter-diagonal Pauli matrix (either o or oy). In the next section, we will study this ‘mixing’ behaviour by counter-diagonal elements in the
extended dynamical model for bivariate paradigms. The final issue concerns the extent to which considering the most general C?
