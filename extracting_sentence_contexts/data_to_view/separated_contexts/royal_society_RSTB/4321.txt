In Man, the
secondary duct connects up with both the dorsal and the ventral duct. The “acces-
sory duct” in Man is, of course, the persistent proximal part of the original dorsal
pancreatic duct. In connection with the interesting fact that in 7ichosurus the dorsal pancreatic
duct may or may not persist in the late foetus, it is of importance to note the
developmental and adult conditions in other Amniotes. In the Reptilia, only one duct persists in the adult; investigators differ, however,
concerning its origin. V6LKER (40), in Lacerta agilis, finds the dorsal duct bound up
with the ductus choledochus ; Hammar (14), also in the Lizard, finds a duct formed
by the fusion of the dorsal with the ventral duct ; CHoronsurrzky (3), in Anguis,
derives it from the two ventral ducts and the dorsal duct.
