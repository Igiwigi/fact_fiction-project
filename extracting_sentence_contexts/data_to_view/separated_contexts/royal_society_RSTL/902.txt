If iron be the cause of the red colour of blood, it must
exist there in a saline state, since the red matter is soluble in
water. The substances, therefore, which detect almost the
smallest quantity of iron in such a state, ought likewise to
demonstrate its presence in blood; but upon adding Prussian
alkali, and an infusion of galls, to a very saturate solution of
the red matter, I could not observe, in the former case, the
slightest blue precipitate, or in the latter, that the mixture had
acquired the least blue, or purple tint. MDCCXCVII, 3K


428 Dr. WeLLs's Observations and Experiments

Upon the whole it appears to me, that blood derives its
colour from the peculiar organization of the animal matter of j
one of its parts; for whenever this is destroyed, the colour dis- ;
appears, and can never be made to return ; which would not,

I think, be the case, if it depended upon the presence of any
foreign substance whatsoever,

I shall conclude this paper with relating several miscellaneous
facts respecting the colour of blood, and some conclusions
which may be formed from them. Dr. PrIEsSTLEY has mentioned, * that the only animal fluid,
beside serum, which he found to transmit the influence of
common air to blood, was milk. But I have observed, that the
white of an egg possesses the same property, notwithstanding
its great tenacity.
