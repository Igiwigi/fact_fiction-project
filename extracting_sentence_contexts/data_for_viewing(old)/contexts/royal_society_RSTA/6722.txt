Like (4.1)—(4.3), this is a known result often encountered without formal statement or
peoof. The identification principle requires us to start by identifying R/p with the subring
+a)! )/q of S/q. These integral domains may in turn be simultaneously identified+ with
FP (R+qS,)/qS, and S = (S+qG,)/qS,. The residue fields of pR, and qG, are identi-
fed with the quotient fields of f= (R,+qS,)/qS, and L = S,/qG, respectively. Clearly
kt, Sc. That f is contained in the quotient field of R follows from the definition of ,,
aed because any element of R not in p is not in qG,; similarly 2 is contained in the quotient
fighd of S. (Actually, both f and & are fields.)
THEOREM 5. Given any prime ideal p of R, there exists a prime ideal q of S lying over p.
3This is one of a series of existence-theorems proved by Krull (1937). The theorems in
stion hold under conditions more general than those postulated throughout Part I of
(Bis paper—as a matter of fact, that is true of almost all the results of this section. The proof
o&Theorem 5 reduces essentially to the remarks that unity cannot be integrally dependent
of the prime ideal pR,; so Theorem 14 supplies a prime ideal of S, which contains pG,,
aad consequently lies over p®,. In the paper of Krull (1937), again, (4, 5)—(4.7) are deduced
idly from the form of Theorem 5 proved there—
(4.5) A prime G-ideal q is maximal if and only if p (= qa ®) is maximal.
~3(4.6) If q lies over p, qS, is a minimal prime over-ideal of pS,. As q, runs through the
d&tinct prime G-ideals lying over p, q, S, runs through all the distinct maximal ideals of S,.
= (4.7) If q, and q, are distinct prime G-ideals lying over the same prime ideal of R, q, ¢ qo.
5For the discussion of ramification theory proper, some further deductions from Theorem 5
are needed. (4.8) and (4.9) are similar to results already used by Krull (19394). First,
combining (8.1), (4.6), and (4.3), it is seen that bS, = bG,_ for any G-ideal b, whence
b, = Nb, provided b< G. It follows that
