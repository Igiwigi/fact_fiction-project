However, at some stage defence users again became
conscious of their dependence on an admittedly fragile component, and began
funding research on plastic substrates. They took this initiative further, asking
for a display that was flexible, with a vision of field maps that were portable,
and could be rolled up. In fact, a form of flexible display had been available
to the consumer for many years, a temperature indicator containing cholesteric
LC. These were marketed widely, and since they were cheap, the customer
rarely complained when their ability to read the temperature lapsed after some
months. That, however, was symptomatic of the problem of using plastics.
