At the 8ame time,
HD two arteries in one of the webs, which had till then remained perfectly constant in
S calibre, as determined by micrometer, began to exhibit variations, and during the
5 next twenty-four hours continued to change their diameter occasionally. There were,
= however, certain peculiarities about these changes suwch as I had never before. seen.
2 Generally speaking, all the arteries of a web are found in the same degree of contrac-
S tion at any one time; but here, one of the vessels under observation was sometimes
E small, when the other, though in the same web, was large ; and not only was there no
E proportion between the degrees of contraction in the two vessels, but in one and the
&E 8ame artery the amount of constriction was very different at different parts. The
E unusual character of these contractions implied that they were caused by some unwonted
E eircumstances; and from their coincidence with the almost total arrest of the blood, as
E well as from the fact that in the left foot, where the circulation continued free, the
= arteries remained of full size till the animal was destroyed, I was led to conclude that
L the puzzling appearances in question must be in some way or other dependent on the
S cexsation of the flow of the vital fluid through the vessels. If this were 80, it seemed
probable that the mechaniszm by which these irregular contractions were induced might
A be as local as their exciting cause, in which case they would be seen to occur in an
amputated limb. In order to determine this point I made the following experiment.
