obtained in the case of B had been rendered very small by the increase in the inertia
of the suspended system (see Table TV.). The difference of 14 per cent. between the
two numbers is, however, well within the limits of experimental error, and they may
therefore be regarded as coinciding for practical purposes, their weighted mean being
nearer 0-502 than 0-510â€”say, 0-505.

The fact of their coinciding is important because it shows that at this point the value
of the Ratio has ceased to be influenced by the inertia as well as by the damping ; so
that we may take it as affording a value of the Ratio which is independent of both these
sources of error.

0-505-+-0-002,* a number which is indistinguishable from one-half, is thus the value
obtained for the Ratio in the case of Specimen No, 10, when all errors known to us
have been eliminated.

The way in which the circles fall among the dots in A strongly suggests that the
deviations of all these points from the one straight line are no more than accidental. It
was therefore interesting to calculate the mean deviations, from the line, of the points
belonging to each specimen separately. By adding or subtracting the deviation of each
