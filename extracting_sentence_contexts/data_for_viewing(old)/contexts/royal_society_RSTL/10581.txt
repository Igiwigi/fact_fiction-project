more Leguminose, and 11 more Miscellanez, in the samples from plot 16 than in
those from plot 14. Taking the average of the four separation-years, there were 37
species found, against 29 with the mineral manure and double quantity of nitrate,
and 49 without manure. There was also, with a tendency to the further reduction
in the number on plot 14 from one year to another, within the separation period, a
greater tendency to regain in number over the same period on plot 16 ; the numbers
found in the four separation-years being 34, 34, 36, and 41, respectively.

"There was a considerably s8maller average percentage of total Graminee with the
smaller than with the larger amount of nitrate (and mineral manures). There was
a much larger, and a greatly increasing, percentage of leguninous herbage, and a
considerably higher average, but a gradually diminishing, proportion of total Mis-
cellane. The herbage was, in fact, less exclusively gramineous, and, upon the whole,
considerably more mixed, with the smaller amount of nitrate, and the consequent less
luxuriance of the freer-growing species.

Among the grasses, neither Poa trivialts nor Bromus mollis, which were 80 prominent
on plot 14, was 80 in any degree on plot 16. Poa trivialis, however, maintained its
position very much better than Bromus molltis, which yielded only a fraction of 1 per
cent. in the fourth separation-year. Nor was any other grass 80 prominent on the
average on plot 16 as both of these were on plot 14. On the other hand, on plot 16,
the prevalent but poor grasses of the locality, Agrostis vulgaris and Festuca ovind
are, upon the whole, the most prominent grasses ; whilst each of these was in mosb
insignificant amount on plot 14. In about equal prominence with Agrostts vulgaris
and Festuca ovina, are Avena flavescens, with a tendency to diminish, Holcus lamnatus,
