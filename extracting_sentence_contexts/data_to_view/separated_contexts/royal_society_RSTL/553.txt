If a piece of wire-gauze sieve is held over a flame of a lamp
or of coal gas, it prevents the flame from passing it, and the
phenomenon is precisely similar to that exhibited by the wire-
gauze cylinders; the air passing through is found very hot,
for it will convert paper into charcoal ; and it is an explosive
mixture, for it will inflame if a lighted taper is presented to
It, but it 1s cooled below the explosive point by passing through
wires even red hot, and by being mixed with a considerable
quantity of air comparatively cold. The real temperature of
visible flame is perhaps as high as any we are acquainted with,
Mr. TexNanT was in the habit of showing an experiment,
which demonstrates the intensity of its heat. He used to fuse
a small filament of platinum in the flame of a common candle;
and it is proved by many facts, that a stream of air may
be made to render a metallic body white hot, yet not be itself
luminous. A considerable mass of heated metal is required to inflame

eyen coal gas, or the contact of the same mixture with an
extensive heated surface. An iron wire of =; of an inch and
8 inches long red hot, when held perpendicularly in a stream
of coal gas, did not inflame it, nor did a short wire of one sixth
of an inch produce the effect held horizontally ; but wire of the
same size, when six inches of it were red hot, and when it was
held perpendicularly in a bottle, containing an explosive mix-
ture, so that heat was successively communicated to portions
of the gas, produced its explosion.
