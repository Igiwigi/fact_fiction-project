municates freely with the cochlea and semicircular canals; but
these cavities are filled with a watery liquor, and have no com-
munication (as the tympanum has) with the external air. This fact was ascertained in the horse, by the following ex-
periment, repeated several times. The organ of hearing was
Separated from the skull immediately after death, and the ca-
vity of the tympanum exposed; the parts were then immersed
in water, and the stapes removed ; by which means, the mem-
brane of the foramen ovale was destroyed, but no globule of
air was seen to escape through the water.*

The following uses have generally been assigned to the parts
now mentioned. The membrana tympani was supposed to be adapted to re-
ceive impressions, by the combined action of the tensor and
laxator muscles varying the degree of its tension, s0 as to bring
it in unison with different sounds : these impressions were con-
ducted, by the chain of bones, to the vestibulum, cochlea, and
semicircular canals ; in which cavities, particularly the cochlea,
they were supposed to undergo some modification, before they
were impressed upon the nerves spread upon the linings of
these cavities.
