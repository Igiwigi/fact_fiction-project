These experiments repeated with another thermometer gave the following results,
all corrections being made :â€”sulphate, 0*76 ; nitrate, 0*77 ; muriate, 0*76 ; oxalate,
075, and tartrate, 0776. These numbers agree perfectly with one another, but their
average is 0*03 higher than the above. Before examining the thermal relations of
these salts, it is necessary to ascertain that their solutions are quite neutral, as the
slightest excess of acid would altogether derange the results.

I attempted to prepare a solution of the hydrocyanate of ammonia, by mixing
together solutions containing an equivalent of hydrocyanic acid and an equivalent of
ammonia. On decomposing this liquid by potash, an elevation of temperature oc-
curred in different trials of 0*87 and 090, which approximates to the preceding
resn]ts. The anomalies presented by the hydrocyanic acid in combining with the
alkalies render this fact of some importance.

The $0-called neutral phosphate and arseniate of ammonia are salts anomalous in
composition, and on theoretical grounds ought to differ in thermal properties from
the other ammoniacal salts. If a second equivalent of ammonia (in dilute solution)
be added to a solution of the ordinary neutral salts of ammonia, no change of tempe-
rature occurs; but the same addition to the neutral phosphate produced an elevation
of temperature of 0*:18, The latter salt, however, loses a part of its ammonia during
evaporation with 80 much facility, preserving always its alkaline reaction, that I am
not sure whether this is a property of the salt when of normal composition, or arose
from its having lost a portion of its base before solution. When the same salt was
decomposed by potash, the results were not uniform ; in one experiment the heat
amounted to 0*98; in another, made with the same salt, after exposure for a very
