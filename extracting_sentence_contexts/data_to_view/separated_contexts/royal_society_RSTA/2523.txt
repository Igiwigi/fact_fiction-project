AND THE CHANGE oF MaAGNetic SUSCEPTIBILITY DUE TO CRYSTALLIZATION. A Comparison of Experimental Results. The general facts which have been described with regard to the large value of Ox
during the crystallization of aromatic compounds and the relatively small value which
has been obtained in the later experiments for substances of an aliphatic nature form
an interesting parallel with those relating to the magnetic double refraction of
aromatic and aliphatic liquids investigated by MM. Corron and Movton.* The
parallelism is particularly striking with nitrobenzene and hexamethylene.
