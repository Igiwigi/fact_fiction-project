gregaria individual to show its extraordinary activity (p. 194). That influence seems to be an
important means of reinforcing activity in bands and swarms (pp. 224-225) but even so
cannot be regarded as an extraneous force. The gregaria individual is so constituted as to
expose itself preferentially to its fellows’ influence and is peculiarly sensitive to it. We might
regard as forced the development of the migratory habit during the change from the
Solitaria to the gregaria phase, since exceptional circumstances are required to bring this
change about. Once gregarization is complete and we are dealing with locusts of the
gregarious phase, however, sustained locomotion does not depend on circumstances that
are exceptional in any way.

If the behaviour of the solitary phase, or of most animals for that matter, be taken as
a standard, then gregarious locusts are clearly abnormal in embarking on a course of
sustained locomotion when conditions are in no way extreme. But the fact is that such
behaviour is normal for gregarious locusts (p. 226). Under favourable conditions the
solitary (or non-migrating gregaria) locust makes only intermittent movement through the
day, periods of movement falling between longer periods of feeding, basking, mating, etc.
Under the same conditions, the migrant keeps up extraordinarily persistent movement,
‘sedentary’ types of behaviour, such as feeding and basking, becoming restricted in con-
sequence to early morning and evening. This migratory activity is characteristic of the
insects themselves:

‘Flying with them (gregarious locusts) may be regarded as a normal state and rest is
enforced by environmental conditions’ (Uvarov 1947).

Persistent locomotory activity is not in itself what distinguishes the migrant, however.
