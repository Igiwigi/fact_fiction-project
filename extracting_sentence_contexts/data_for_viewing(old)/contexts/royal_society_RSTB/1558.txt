shows that the irritant does not extend to the surrounding tissue. Menstruation,
then, cannot be considered to be an inflammatory process.

The considerable flow of blood from the ruptured vessels during menstruation would

1. Tumefaction ;

2. Menstruation ;
3. Restoration of the mucosa ;

and he distinguishes between these periods and a period of rest which completes the
