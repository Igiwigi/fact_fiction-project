spectively — 19.751, — 29.030, and — 29,418, all of them
greatly below what appears to have been the velocity up to
1820, and not differing more than might fairly be expected,
considering the difficulty presented by the unequal size of
the stars. The last determination, considering the great
number of measures it rests upon, may be regarded as en-
titled to great confidence, in spite of the discordant results of
April 3 and May 5, 1825, which, however, whether rejected
or retained, make little difference in the final mean. It was
on these (unluckily), that the note at the end of the paper of
1824 was founded.

this star can hardly be doubted. - But as it is inconsistent
with the laws of central forces that. this should take place
without a corresponding increase of distance (for the angular
velocity is inversely as the square of the distance in the ap-
parent as well as in the 7eal orbit, whatever be its position
