that shown in fig, 3 represents a new formation of secreting tissue from an islet, or of
an islet from secreting tissue. The impression gathered from a consideration of such
a preparation by itself is strongly in favour of the latter view. The unequal
distribution of the staining reaction, so that an isolated cell, or part of a cell, shows
the basophile reaction, which fades away towards its edge; the presence of cells
which have no basophile properties, but retain a few eosinphile granules, which appear
to be undergoing solution ; the faint trace of alveolar outline, like the shadow of a

structure which is being lost ; none of these would be expected in a new formation of
alveoli. In the same direction points the fact that the abundance of these
intermediate forms is greatly increased by such influences as cause increase in the
number and size of the islets. To the consideration of these we must now proceed.

v. The Effect of Secretory Activity on the Mammalian Pancreas.

For the study of this effect only the cat and dog were taken as types of mammalia,
The effect on the rabbit was not observed, since, as shown by BaYuiss and Starting,
secretin makes only a small difference in the rate of its pancreatic secretion.

The dogs and cats were anzsthetised with morphia and A.C.E. mixture, a cannula
tied in the pancreatic duct, so that the rate of secretion could be watched, and
secretin solution injected into the jugular vein in doses of 5-10 c.c. at such intervals
