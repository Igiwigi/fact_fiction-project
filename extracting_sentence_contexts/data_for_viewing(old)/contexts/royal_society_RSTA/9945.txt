Now it has been found that by a judicious choice of a, a, ..., a, the quantity
[(-**) (1% ) Rie «(1% )] may be made small for all possible values of d,?.

(Thus fig. 1 shows this done for a set of seven (a)’s, This graph was arrived at by
trial.) The error E,,; of 4; may therefore be made small in comparison with that
of ¢,. This is possible because the values of ),’ lie in a finite range; corresponding
to the fact that there are only a finite number of terms in the series SA,P,. A similar
process will not work with the infinite series of sines, Bessel functions and other
infinitesimal integrals of (0—\) P = 0. In choosing a, a, ..., @, a diagram of the
kind shown in figs. 1 and 2 is a great help. In this we take for the abscissa a
variable \* which takes in turn the values \,°, 2, ..., 4,2, and as ordinate we consider

The value of at d* = d,? is the ratio of the amplitude of the vibration P, in the final
approximation ¢,,, to its amplitude in the initial guess. The individual factors
(1—A*/a,) in w represent straight lines, all cutting the vertical axis at o = 1 and the
