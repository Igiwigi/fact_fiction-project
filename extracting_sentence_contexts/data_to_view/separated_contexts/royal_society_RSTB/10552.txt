In the second set of
experiments, protomer oligomerization and formation of
pore complexes was studied at ClyA concentrations above
5nM over a wide range of concentrations (5 nM-5 uM). For this purpose, FRET donor/acceptor—labelled ClyA was
mixed with a high excess of unlabelled wild-type ClyA, so
that ClyA oligomers and pore complexes only contained a
single copy of donor/acceptor—labelled ClyA. The complete
assembly mechanism could then be clarified based on the fact
that the ClyA monomer (M), the monomeric, kinetic inter-
mediate (I), the protomer (P) and the protomer in the
context of oligomers or pores (P,) showed distinct and
characteristic FRET efficiencies that allowed the quantitative,
time-resolved analysis of their population during protomer
formation or pore assembly [20]. The single-molecule FRET kinetics of DDM-induced
protomer formation at low ClyA concentrations confirmed
