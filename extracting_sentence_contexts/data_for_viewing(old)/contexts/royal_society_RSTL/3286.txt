dence would have been obliterated of the extension thus far of the action of these
causes.

I have already alluded to the important fact communicated to me by Sir Davip
BrewsTER, namely, that he has seen $helves in the valley of the Spey. At Phones,
which is situated about a mile from the Truim, and about five above its confluence
with the Spey, one broad and well-marked shelf occurs, along which a carriage can
be driven. On the banks of the Spey, about twenty-five miles below its source, two
shelves occur in an elevated angle between the Burns of Belleville and the river.
They are small; the upper one, however, is very broad; and their elevation is
about 800 feet above the sea. Sir David BrewsTER says, that the shelves in both
places appear horizontal, and that they resemble those of Glen Roy, though pos-
ses8ing far less grandeur and symmetry. The fact of their occurrence at these dis-
tant points is, as we $hall hereafter see, highly important.

Section IL â€”The Theories of Sir Laupzr Dick and Dr. MAccuLLocn considered.

Sir Lavpes believes that a separate lake existed in each valley, where we now see
a $helf, and was separately drained. In Glen Roy, where three shelves occur,
all plainly developed, (with the exception of Belleville, this is the only place where
more than one has been observed,) the arguments in fayour of a separate lake possess
the greatest force. Without entering into any description of the physical features of
Glen Roy, inspection of the accompanying map, taken with some few alterations
