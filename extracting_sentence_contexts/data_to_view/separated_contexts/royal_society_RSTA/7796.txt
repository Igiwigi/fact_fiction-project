The period of 6C
seems to have remained fairly constant until January, 1934, after which it decreased. It was decided to assume that it remained constant at its initial value until
10 January, 1934 (D = 100), and that it then decreased linearly to its final value
on 1 June, 1934 (D = 242).

6C at Cambridge = 0-5054447, before 10 January, 1934 )

mca)
6C at Cambridge = 0-5054461, — 0-146 x 10° 7D after 10 January, 1934)
Combining this with (4) and (6) above, we have,
6C-Base at Cambridge
= — 7866-2 + 0-135D before 10 January, 1934 |
= — 7851-6 — 0-011D after 10 January, 1934

Mean of 6A and 6C-Base at Cambridge
— — 7876-9 + 0-135D before 10 January, 1934 |
= — 7869-6 + 0:062D after 10 January, 1934

These expressions were adopted throughout* and the values in col. 21 of Table 1V
have been obtained from them. It is not supposed that the change in 6C took place
exactly in the manner assumed; in fact there is some evidence from fig. 4 that all
the change occurred between January and April, 1934; the assumed form of the
variation is, however, probably as near the truth as any other simple assumption. The change is not large ; if it had been neglected altogether and the simple mean
of the initial and final observations used throughout the adopted value of g would
at no station be changed by more than 0-002 cm/sec?.

2.6. Repeat Stations—It will be seen from Table IV that several stations were
visited more than once.
