of charged particles at both air/water and oil / water interfaces. The linear portions of the curves
obey the equation
IT =CA~*? + 1p, (2.1)

where the coefficient C characterizes the slope of the experimental line and [7p is a background
surface pressure. The slanted parts of the /7(A) isotherms (figure 2a-c), corresponding to higher
A (and lower /7) values, can be explained by the fact that the electrostatic interaction has a certain
range, so that above a given distance between the particles they are not strongly interacting and,
thus, only a ‘gas’ phase of particles is present. Our study is focused on the steep parts of the
surface-pressure isotherms, corresponding to the compression of particle monolayers without
voids. Note that equation (2.1) is obeyed by monolayers from monodisperse particles, as well as
by monolayers from slightly polydisperse particles such as those used in this study [23].

Figure 2c (experiment 2) compares JI(A) isotherms measured with the same amount of
particles, from the same batch, but spread on the surface of a water and 1mM KCI solution. The
data indicate that at the smaller values of A (at the higher degrees of compression) /7 is higher for
the monolayer spread on the surface of the 1mM KCI solution. This result seems paradoxical,
because the electrolyte is expected to suppress the electrostatic interparticle repulsion and to
lower the surface pressure /7. A possible explanation for this result is proposed in §3d.
