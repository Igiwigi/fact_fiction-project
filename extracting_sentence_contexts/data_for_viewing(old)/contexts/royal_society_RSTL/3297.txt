ments, within the same period, have been more than half as great as those which have
affected the latter colossal chain. But regarding the exact period, allowance must,
be made, since on the one hand the glaciers of the Alps, situated ten degrees nearer
the equator than those on the mountains of Lochaber, must have much earlier re-
treated upwards, and failed in descending to the level of the sea, during the change
from the former to the present climate ; whilst, on the other hand, to counteract the
equatorial influence, they were appendages on a greater mass of snow accumulated
on far loftier chains.

Section VIIL.—On the small amount of alluvial action since the formation of the shelves.

I now pass on to another consideration. MaccuLLocx was much struck with the
fact, that in many cases where a shelf crossed a rivulet, I mean one of those silver-
like threads of water which descend the flanks of steep mountains in nearly straight

marked upon the sand below by a deep and broad furrow, which remained visible for a long time afterwards,
as I have been informed by several members of the Society, who saw it after an interval of more than a year,”
I presume from the position of the stone as a land-mark, and from the distance it was transported by the rising
tide, that the furrow left by its passage must have been either oblique or parallel to the shore, What would
have been the effect if this large and heavy block had been pushed over a surface of solid rock instead of sand?_
This question will recall to the mind of those who have read the late papers of Mezsrs, CnanvuxTIER, VENETZ,
and Agase1z, the case of the longitudinally and obliquely scratched rocks of the Alps, In the Addenda to my
Journal during the voyage of the Beagle, I have endeavoured to show that the passage of ice, with imbedded
fragments of rock, acting at uccessive levels on the surface of shoals during the gradual rising of the land,
offers the most probable explanation of the scratches and grooves, which have justly excited s0 much attention
