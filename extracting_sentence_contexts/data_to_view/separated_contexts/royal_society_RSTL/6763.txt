The theory of equations of the above type has been discussed fully in my memoir
« On a General Method in Analysis.” , In particular it is there shown that the above
equation can be conyerted into another of the same type,

This theory I shall apply here, not to the ordinary finite solution, but to the solution
by definite integrals of the differential equation (I). In doing this I shall give to U and
V the particular values 0. We are justified in doing this by the canons relating to the
arbitrary constants which are laid down in the memoir ; but it will suffice here to direct
attention to the fact that while the processes employed are strictly speaking particular,
they lead to a solution involving the requisite number of arbitrary constants, and at
the same time of the proper form, as manifested by the snecession of the indices in its
development. Giving then to (T) the form

Then by (2)

since representing [=D+3—1] - by 2(D), the first term in the factorial expression

J of e(D—n) will 59 follow the last term in that of @(D) as to leave the law of factorial
succession unbroken.
