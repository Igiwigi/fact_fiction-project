DR. A. GAMGEE ON THE ACTION OF NITRITES ON BLOOD. 597

The two observations which I have adduced suffice to show the action which the solu-
tion of any nitrite exerts upon the colouring-matter. In my observations I have most
frequently treated blood with solutions of nitrite of potassium and sodium. The action
of a solution of nitrite of silver is, however, similar. The latter solution should be
freshly prepared, and should not be much exposed to light. 'The observations should
also, in this case, be made within a short time after the addition of the nitrite to the
blood-solution, as otherwise the solution often becomes turbid.

The fact that ammonia altered the colour of blood which had been treated with
nitrites from a chocolate-colour to red, might be explained on the supposition that some
<Lhange had occurred in the constitution of the body formed under their influence, although
J was quite possible that the spectrum of the body in a decidedly alkaline fluid might be
Aifferent from that of the same substance in a nearly neutral solution. In order to deter-
Hine whether the difference induced in the colour and spectram was merely due to the
Slkalinity of the fluid, or to the presence of free ammonia, I prepared a dilute solution
Sf ammonia. This solution contained 10 grms. of ammonia in 1 litre. I then made
EN exactly equivalent solution of phosphoric acid. The solutions were $0 exactly made
Shat when equal quantities were mixed the fluid had no action on litmus. A weak
Zolution of hemoglobin was made, and a soJlution of nitrite of sodium added to it. As
Soon as the bands Â« and 3 had almost disappeared and the band in the red had ap-
