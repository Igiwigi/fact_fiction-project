than the interval for the excited beat (Plate 12, fig. 28); an observation which has
also been made by ERFMANN.

Influence of Fibre Direction.—We studied this question over the right ventricle
(Table VI) and found higher rates in the direction of the superficial fibres than across
them, for the most part; but our results did not bring us satisfaction for the reason
that regions of the ventricle studied for straight or cross conduction necessarily varied
in respect of underlying structures. Over the left ventricle, where muscle regions can
be chosen in which this factor is less disturbing, we could find little or no difference in
rate (Table VII). Our results are sufficient we think to show that the direction of
the superficial fibres has no material influence. But these studies brought out a fact
of very considerable importance.
