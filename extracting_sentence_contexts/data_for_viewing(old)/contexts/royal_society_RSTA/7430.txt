Q is known at each instant; the axial moment of inertia C can then be found when the dis-
position of the charge is known (see § 9-2). Also the aerodynamic parameters I’, and T,
are assumed to be known. The jet torque Gp can be found, when the form of the nozzle
system and the charge characteristics are known, by the methods given in the following
subsection.

is called the jet damping factor. It can be evaluated when the form of the charge is known.
We have, in fact, from (9-2-15)
