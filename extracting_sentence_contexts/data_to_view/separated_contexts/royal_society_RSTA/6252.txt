By shielding, we convey a finite region of ‘stillness’ in
the vicinity of the inclusion. The reason we use the quotation marks is to emphasize, here and in
what follows, the approximate nature of the stillness (or silence for acoustics) of these regions. It should be noted that, although the Green’s function for the biharmonic equation is in fact
bounded, we use solely the Macdonald functions to construct our elastic cloak and therefore
consent to infinite fields at the device centres, since Kg(z) ~ log(z) and K,(z) ~ 1/z” as z > 0. Unlike
the Hankel functions, however (used as a basis to formulate the acoustic exterior cloak in [8—-10]),
the fields emanating from the evanescent devices decay at infinity and thus require less attention
than their acoustic analogue. It is known that clamped inclusions in thin plates possess the most
scattering signature, as illustrated in figure 1a.
