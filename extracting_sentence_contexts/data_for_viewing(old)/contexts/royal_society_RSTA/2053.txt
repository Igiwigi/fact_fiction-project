&(X, s)(G2(s) — G1(s)) = 2) or (G2(s) — ¢1(s)) = (A 38)

The right-hand side of the equality (A38) represents the Laplace image of some function,
where ¢(X,s) is a Laplace transform of any arbitrary function c(X, r). Let us assume that c(X, t) =
2w(x)./t/z. This function is equal to zero at t=0 and Laplace transform of this function exists.
Substituting its Laplace transform ¢(X,s) = (1/s,/s)~w(x), into equation (A 38), leads to (g2(s) —
G1(s)) = Js, but /3 cannot by a Laplace transform of any function (hence, the necessary condition
is not satisfied). This fact proves that the equality (A 38) is valid only if w(x) =0. Hence, (¢2(s) —
G1(s)) =0 > G2(s) = G1(s) > ¢1(t) = ¢2(). It means that equation (A 37) has a unique solution.

Application of Laplace transform to equation (A37) leads to the following equation in
transforms: s¢(X, s)@a(s) = [s®c(X,s — A) — (s — AP e(X, 0)]Is=s+a- Accounting for the condition
c(X, 0) = 0, we obtain equation sc(X,s)¢,(s) = (s + A)®e(X,s), from where the transform of function
g a(t) can be readily found, so that @,(s) = (s + A)P /s. Applying it to the inverse Laplace transform
yields
