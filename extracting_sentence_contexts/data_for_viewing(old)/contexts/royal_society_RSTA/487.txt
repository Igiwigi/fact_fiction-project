samples with Orientation A. The reason for the deflection can be found in the low fracture : >
toughness found for crack propagation along or close to SD (orientation A). For Mode-I 7
propagation, the crack would have to cleave the elongated grains or it would have to take a Ny
more tortuous crack path by passing the elongated grains in an intercrystalline manner. Both :B
scenarios seem to have a higher fracture resistance than the one along the SD (table 3). Since &
the crack runs again close to the SD the failure type is again an intercrystalline one. Despite :
this, the fracture toughness is higher compared with Orientation A. The reason for this can be
found in the fact that the crack-bifurcation reduces the local driving force for crack propagation.
For a short-kinked crack, the local driving force is only about 50% of the global one [33].
Therefore, without considering any further plastification, the fracture toughness in Orientation
B should be about twice as large as for Orientation A, which has to be regarded as a lower
bound value since for a pure Mode-I propagation higher driving forces, i.e. fracture toughness
would be needed. In the phenomenology very often used to describe the fracture behaviour of
layered structures, laminates or rolled structures, this specimen orientation can be termed crack
arrester configuration.

In Orientation C, a completely different fracture surface can be found. There are secondary
cracks or delaminations which have the same crack plane as specimens with Orientation A, which
indicates that the low fracture toughness along the SD-plane seems to trigger the formation of
these delaminations. The positive effect onto the fracture toughness (table 3) is well known for
