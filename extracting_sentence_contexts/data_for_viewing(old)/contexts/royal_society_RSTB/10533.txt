performance of multiple herbivores simultaneously. The stron-
ger effects of domestication on resistance in seeds relative to
leaves also fit our predictions, which were primarily based on
the idea that resource-allocation trade-offs should be strongest
in costly reproductive structures [3,18]. This hypothesis is
further supported by the results for plant traits, where fruits
and seeds were the only organs where we detected a negative
effect of domestication on defence traits.

Across studies that measured putative plant defence traits,
we detected negative effects of domestication only when traits
were measured in harvested organs or in fruits or seeds.
Interpretation of these results is limited by the fact that the
two variables were confounded: rarely were fruit and seed
traits measured if those organs were not the ones harvested
by humans. Thus, it is not possible to conclude with certainty
whether these effects are due to differences among organs
per se, differences based on which organ is harvested, or a com-
bination of the two. Many studies did measure leaf traits
regardless of whether leaves were harvested, and an examin-
ation of this data subset showed that defence traits were
reduced in leaves only when leaves were the harvested organ
(d = —2.04, 95% CI: —0.44 to —3.65; data not shown). This
suggests that at least the differential effects of domestication
on harvested and non-harvested organs probably hold across
