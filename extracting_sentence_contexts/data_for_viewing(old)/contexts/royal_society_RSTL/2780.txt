Since the tide-wave in most parts of this series moves in opposite directions on the
opposite sides of the sea, it is clear that the parts cannot be represented by any mo-
tion of a wave along a channel. Nor will it answer well to suppose the wave to run
from C to A along the British coast, and back from A to C along the German coast;
for the intervals of the lines would, on this supposition, diminish much in passing
from the space CB to B A, and increase much again in passing from AB to BC;
besides which this view does not take into account the disappearance of the tides
on the coast of Denmark, and the connexion of the tides of Holland with those of
France,

It appears that we may best combine all the facts into a consistent scheme, by
dividing this ocean into two rotatory systems of tide-waves ; one occupying the space
from B to C, that is, from Norfolk and Holland to Norway ; and the other the space
from A to B, between the Netherlands and England. In the former space the co-
tidal lines may be supposed to revolve round the point C, where there is no tide; for
it is clear that at a point where all the cotidal lines meet, it is high water equally at
all hours, that is, the tide vanishes. In the space A B we must, suppose similarly a
tideless centre, as D, about which the cotidal lines revolve.

This mode of conceiving the progress of the tide does not differ essentially from
the hypothesis of a progress from C to A and back from A to C, as already men-
tioned : for on s8uch a hypothesis the motion might be conceived to be resolyed into
two rotatory systems, the wave being supposed to pass from VI. to 7. and from 6. to
