So we call u a deformation and write
y for the value u(x). The selection of a functional space for deformations is already a constitutive
assignment. A function space is defined, in fact, by some properties pertaining to its elements, so
that they may describe some peculiarities of a class of material behaviours, excluding others. In the above definition of u, the space € is a copy of €, obtained by an orientation-preserving
isomorphism or more simply the identification. The distinction between the space in which
we select the reference macroscopic shape of a body and the one including its deformed
configurations finds its reason of being in two basic aspects: one is connected with the definition
of changes in observers, the other concerns the computation of the so-called vertical and horizontal
variations of the energy in the conservative case, the former leading to the balance of forces, the
latter producing the balance of configurational interactions, at least in the conservative case.
