creased or diminished, but their directions could not be
changed.

I have before mentioned that both Mr. BarLow and myself
found some anomalies between the observations in-doors and
those at the same points in the open air. When the times of
the maxima $hall have been determined independent of the
temperature of the magnets, I expect it will be found that
these anomalies have arisen from the difference in the changes
of temperature in the magnets when in-doors and when in
the open air: of this I only feel that degree of doubt, which
Should always be entertained until a fact is established.

If such observations as I have given were continued for a
length of time, particularly those near the east and west, I
certainly expect that they would lead to important conclu-
sions respecting the causes of the diurnal variation, and I
regret that, as I have not the time to devote to them myself,
I must leave them to be made by others possessed of more
leisure. Should they be undertaken, the necessity of ascer-
taining in the first instance, the effects which changes of
temperature haye on the forces of the magnets employed,
and of observing the temperature of the magnets themselves
