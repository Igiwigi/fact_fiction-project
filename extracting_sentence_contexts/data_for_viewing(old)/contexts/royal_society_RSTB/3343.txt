Each nodule has the form of an oblate spheroid, and lies in the shales so that its
greatest diameter is parallel to the bedding plane. When cut through, these nodules
often show a distinct though very fine bedding in the same direction as the bedding
of the shales, and frequently the small Goniatites within them congregate in bands
along the planes of this bedding (fig. 16, Plate 19). These facts prove that the nodules

must have been formed in situ; had they originated elsewhere such an arrangement of
the bedding would be impossible, The fact that the floor and the roof nodules are
formed in situ lends support, were it needed, to the argument that the seam nodules
were also formed where they are found.

In these roof nodules isolated plants are also to be found in which the tissues are
partly excellently preserved. The plant tissues are generally completely surrounded,
and may even be partly penetrated by the fine Goniatite-containing mud which forms
the matrix of the nodule. These plants have evidently drifted into the silt of a sea
bottom—but they will be considered later (see p. 204, Section V).
