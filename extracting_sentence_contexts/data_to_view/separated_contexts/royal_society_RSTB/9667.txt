Findings revealed that children tended
to make relatively fair offers and frequently rejected unfair
offers. However, despite successfully inducing group bias, the
minimal group manipulation had no effect on children’s propo-
sals or rejections. As discussed in §2a, the fact that group bias
was not observed in the Ultimatum Game may be because
this game demands that participants resolve a tension between
group loyalty and a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agree-
ment with their partner. Put differently, children are especially
reactive to unfairness when it places them in a disadvantageous
position [60] and this strong reaction may eclipse group bias
effects in games structured like the Ultimatum Game. Second, Jordan et al. [61], tested 6- and 8-year-olds from the
USA in a group-based third-party Dictator Game in which
they learned about a selfish actor who refused to share with a
recipient.
