would be disposed just the same as if the other was not
present. They would be mixed in equal volumes at the
earth's surface; the carbonic acid would rapidly diminish in
density in ascending, and terminate perhaps at 28 or go miles
of elevation ; the hydrogen would 5/owly diminish in den-
8ity, and terminate perhaps at 11 or 12 hundred miles of
elevation.


Mr. DauiroN on the constitution of the atmosphere. 188

The arguments in support of this notion may be derived
from the following facts :

15t. When two gases, not having a manifest chemical
action upon each other, are put into a vessel of small limited
capacity, they are found in a short time to be uniformly
diffused through the capacity of the vessel, whatever be their
proportions.

2d. Let a bottle, having its air exhausted, be half filled
with water, and the other half with a mixture of equal
volumes of two gases, suppose hydrogen and carbonic acid ;
then let an air-tight stopper be applied, and the contents of
the bottle be duly agitated. The carbonic acid will be found
