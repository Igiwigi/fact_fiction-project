also by groups. He pointed out that especially in the case of human populations the
individuals are almost invariably grouped. ‘These groups are then grouped again and
again’ (p. 568). ‘If there are enormous difficulties in sampling individuals at random these
difficulties may be greatly diminished when we adopt groups as the elements of sampling’
(p. 569).

340. Bowley had distinguished between purposive selection and random sampling in
the following way: ‘In purposive selection the unit is an aggregate, such as the whole
district, and the sample is an aggregate of these aggregates, while in random selection the
unit is a person or thing which may or may not possess an attribute or with which some
measurable quantity is associated’ (p. 570). Neyman pointed out that the fact that ‘the
elements of sampling are not human individuals but groups of these individuals, does not
necessarily involve a negation of the randomness of the sampling’ (p. 571). He therefore
considered this to be a ‘special type of random sampling by groups’, and did not think
that the nature of the elements of the sampling should be ‘considered as constituting any
essential difference between random sampling and purposive selection’ (p. 571).

341. Neyman’s method of stratified sampling by groups resembles but is different in
one respect from what has been called the zonal configurational type. In the present
paper discussion has been restricted to what has been called the overlapping system of
grid sampling (paragraph 60), while Neyman uses what has been called here the system
of ‘exclusive’ sampling units in the footnote to the same paragraph. The essential dis-
tinction is this: In the present method the same basic cell or the same individual may form
