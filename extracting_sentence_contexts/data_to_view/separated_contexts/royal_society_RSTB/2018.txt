SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES

distinctly that one might be inclined to doubt, with M. Zerter, whether these
plants were after all anything more than peculiar and highly modified Ferns.*
Yet even in this species clear indications of Cycadean affinities are present. The
whole structure of the petiole and leaf generally is strikingly like that of the Cycads ;
just as much so, in fact, as in any other “ Myelorylon.” + The occasional formation of
accessory bundles in the cortex of the stem is suggestive of Cycadean anomalies,
comparable with those observed by WEBER and StERzEL in other species of Medullosa. The structure of the roots, never before observed in any member of the group, weighs
appreciably on the Cycadean side, though, on the other hand, the abundant produc-
tion of adventitious roots is in itself a decidedly Pteridophytic character. The course
of the leaf-trace bundles—a number of the principal traces passing out into each leaf,
and at the same time increasing their number by repeated sub-division—is quite
peculiar, differing essentially both from the system in existing Cycadaceze, and from
that in the extinct Bennettitez.{ A better analogy may be sought in those poly-
stelic Ferns which have numerous leaf-trace bundles, markedly smaller than the steles
of the stem.§

On the whole, however, it is evident that Medullosa anglica, like other Medullosez,
combined Cycadean with Filicinean characters, though in this comparatively simple
species the resemblance to Ferns is more prominent than in other members of the
group. :

The fact, now, as it seems to me, established, that the leaf-traces of Medullosa were
concentric in structure on first leaving the steles, throws a welcome light on
Sewarn’s Lachiopteris Williamsoni, a fossil petiole which that author separated*
from Myeloxylon on the ground, among others, that its vascular bundles are con-
centric and not collateral.|| The general resemblance to Myeloxylon is manifest, and
there is no reason to doubt that it indicates near relationship, for it is perfectly con-
ceivable that in some of the Medullosee the foliar bundles may have retained
concentric structure in the petiole, instead of losing it in their passage through the
cortex.
