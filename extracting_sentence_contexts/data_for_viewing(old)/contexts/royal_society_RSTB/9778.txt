ution (in toto or a fraction of them; see, for instance, [83]) or
used for the general patterning of the neuroepithelia, instead
of being devoted to the specification of concrete neural areas/
structures [84-86].

The alternative hypothesis is the multiple origin of centra-
lized NSs, which states that they have evolved,
independently, more than once [84,85,101,102]. The hypoth-
esis relies on the observation that there is a ‘patchy’


distribution of clades with complex brains within the
metazoan tree [85]. In fact, it is known that in each of the
two bilaterian major clades (Deuterostomia and Protostomia),
animals having compact brains and animals with diffuse
nerve nets (and different degrees in between) coexist, even
within the same taxon. Some authors such as Moroz [84]
go a step further and argue that even neuronal cells might
have originated more than once in the course of evolution.
In this hypothesis, the urbilaterian ancestor might have had
a non-centralized NS with a nerve net-like organization
(with some general patterning mechanisms already in
place). Centralization of the nervous structures may have
derived from such a net (or net-like) arrangement between
five and nine times in metazoans according to Moroz
