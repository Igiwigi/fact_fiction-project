polypitef., The fact in question also proves that the particular effect which is produced
on the polypite by stimulating any one of these lines cannot be $0 produced by stimu-

lating any of the other lines. Or, to state the same thing in the words previously used,
we have conclusive proof that, so far as their function is concerned, these radial linegpf
differentiated tissne are undistinguishable from what we elsewhere know as afferent
nerves. But although these tracts of differentiated tissxwue thus far resemble afferent,
nerves in their function, we s0on see that in one important particular they differ widely
from such nerves; for we have seen that, after they have been divided, stimulation of
their peripheral parts still continues to be transmitted to their central parts, as shown
by the non-localizing movements of the polypite. Of course this transmission cannot
take place through the divided tissue-tracts themselves ; and hence the only hypothesis
we can frame to account for the fact of its occurrence is that which would suppose these
tissue-tracts, or afferent lines, to be capable of vicarious action. Such vicarious action
would probably be effected by means of intercommunicating lines, the directions of which
would probably be various. In this way we arrive at the hypothesis of the whole con-
tractile sheet being pervaded by an intimate plexus of functionally differentiated tissue,
the constituent elements of which are capable of vicarious action in a high degree (se
severity of section in fig. 8). And this hypothesis, besides being recommended by the
consideraticn of its being the only feasible one that is open, is confirmed by the fact that
the stimuli which it supposes to escape from a severed phalanx of radial lines, and thus

* Tt may here be stated that tho greater sensitiveness of tho nutrient tubes is alsv made apparent by the

uxually consists, as before stated, in a local bending in of the part irritated ; whereas in response to similar
