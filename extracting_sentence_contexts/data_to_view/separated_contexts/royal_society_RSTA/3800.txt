Finally, we recall that this paper is entirely based on classical Maxwell theory, even though the
description uses mode operators that are reminiscent of quantum mechanics. There is no quantum,
indeterminacy here, and each physical quantity has a well-defined value for any mode. This is
also true for the densities of the three components of spin and orbital AM and for their integral
values, in spite of the fact that the corresponding operators are non-commuting. The suggestive
expressions (2.11) for the integral values of conserved quantities are not taken as a starting point,
but they originate from well-known expressions for the densities in terms of the Maxwell fields. In contrast, a quantum mechanical wave function in general does not define a local density of
physical quantities.
