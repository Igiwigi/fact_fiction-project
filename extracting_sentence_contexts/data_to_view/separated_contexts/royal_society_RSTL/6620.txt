I But the results obtained with Graminacez in 1858, when all possible sources of error

Swhich the experience of the previous year had suggested had been eliminated, point,

-Swithout exception, to the fact that, under the circumstances of growth to which the plants

Swere 8ubjected, no assimilation of free Nitrogen has taken place. The regular process

ES cell-formation has gone on; carbonic acid has been decomposed, and carbon and the

Selements of water have been transformed into cellulose ; the plants have drawn the nitro-

Sgenous compounds from the older cells to perform the mysterious office of the formation

Eof new cells (see Notes on growth, Appendix, pp. 559, 561); those parts have been deye-

Aloped which required the smallest amount of Nitrogen ; and all the stages of growth

#have been passed through to the formation of glumes, pales, and awns for the seed. Eln fact, the plants have performed all the functions that it is possible for a plant to

Sperform when deprived of a sufficient supply of combined Nitrogen. They have gone

Son thus increasing their organic constituents with one constant amount of combined

| until the percentage of that element in the vegetable matter is far below the

Sordinary amount of it—that is, until the composition indicates that further development

Shad ceased for want of a supply of available Nitrogen.

a Throughout all these phases, water saturated with free Nitrogen has been passing
through the plant; nitrogen dissolved in the fluid of the cells has constantly been in
the most intimate contact with the contents of the cells and with the cell-walls. The
newly forming cell, stunted in its development for want of assimilable Nitrogen, has
nevertheless been surrounded by free Nitrogen.
