First because the speculation regarding the
structure of Stauwropterts rhizome is based on an assumption for which there is no evidence,
and the weight that should be attached to it is very doubtful. Secondly, the comparison
between the sporangia of Stauropteris, and those of Psilotales and Sphenophyllales, is not
convincing. In fact, the terminal position of the sporangium was not peculiar only to


THE MORPHOLOGY OF STAUROPTERIS BURNTISLANDICA 89

Stauropteris, it was a common feature in the Devonian and early Carboniferous plants. Similarly, I see no resemblance between a synangium of Psilotum or a strobilus of Spheno-
phyllum and a simple terminal sporangium of Stauropteris, which, indeed, is more like that
of Asteroxylon. The discovery of the heterosporous nature of Stauropteris has further com-
plicated the matter.
