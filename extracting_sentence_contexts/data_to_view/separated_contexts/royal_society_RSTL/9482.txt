Bands {mo edge sharply defined. both edges not sharply defined. Regarding the general absorption we have nothing very noteworthy to remark,
beyond the fact that as a rule in the hydrocarbons of the same series those of heayier
molecular constitution seem to have less than those of lighter. In regard to the special absorptions we may say that it is very often easy to distin-
guish the position of lines at the edges of bands, though they are not sufficiently
marked to be represented on the map. This is more noteworthy, when we have a
change from a very dense absorption to a feebler one.
