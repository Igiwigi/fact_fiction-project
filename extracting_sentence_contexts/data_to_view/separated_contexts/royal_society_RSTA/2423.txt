Second, a large fraction of the plasma current, several MA in the largest tokamaks, will
flow through the vessel components as so-called halo currents. Given the Tesla-level fields that
exist in the tokamak, this imparts huge forces on the vessel components and structure which
the tokamak has to be designed to withstand. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that these
currents do not flow uniformly, and their distribution may be related to the details of the nonlinear
plasma structures associated with the MHD instability that led to the disruption. This makes it
difficult to quantify the magnitude of the forces, but also the directions in which they will act. The third challenge is that very high electric fields can form in the plasma during a disruption | 10 |
which will accelerate electrons to very high energyâ€”so-called runaway electrons that can rapidly

multiply via an avalanching effect.
