X-ray reflection, not of spacing 6-64 A.U., but of spacing 3-32 A.U., a fact which suggests
that the elongated molecule is in some way of a two-fold nature, in the sense that it
consists of two similar parts attached end to end. In this connection it may be
mentioned that the ordinary peptide chain

may be considered to be built up of similar sections each of length equal to about 34 AU.
which is a little larger than the spacing, 3-32 ALU., found in 6-hair. In view of the fact
that a spacing does not necessarily equal a chief intra-molecular distance, it is possible
that the spacing, 3-32 A.U., may be evidence of the existence of peptide chain in $-hair. Meyer and Mark* have already put forward this simple arrangement as the structural
basis of silk fibroin, in spite of the fact that silk, though free from sulphur, from certain
points of view may be classed as a keratin (loc. cit.). The Contents of the Unit Cell.—From the evidence as yet available, we cannot fix the
dimensions of the unit cell of either «- or $-hair with any degree of finality.
