ik (A—nc)" = Ke,

and the general expression for the specific conductivity becomes

S

P « = aK’ (A—ne)".

5 No solution of any substance in any one of the halogen hydrides has yet been
found with high value for the conductivity, a fact which may be assigned to one of
ree causes, namely, either (1) the concentration, or (2) the coefficient of ionisation of
fie electrolyte is small, or (3) the ionic velocities may be very small. If we assume
the first to be the most probable cause, A—ne will not differ much from A, and we
imuy without sensible error make use of the values for the total concentration in
épplying the above equation to our results.
"2 This has been done, the equation being used in the form of «V" = aK’, and the
ults of the calculations are given in Tables I. and II.
8 Table I. contains the values of V and of «V* (or aK’) for those solutions in which
ig= 2, that is, in which two molecules of solute combine with the solvent to form
@e molecule of the electrolyte. Table II. contains the similar value for those
utions for which n = 3.
