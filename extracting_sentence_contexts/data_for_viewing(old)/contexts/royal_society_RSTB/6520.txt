connecting band was attached to the cell, the rest having apparently been thrown off.
In February they numbered twenty-six in a sample of 400 cells; in April only two
were found among 100 cells, and in subsequent cultures they did not occur any
more.


SOME MARINE PLANKTON DIATOMS 37

At first I was tempted to regard this process as a regulation of the cell diameter
independent of auxospores.* The rigid girdle being broken the cell could expand and
form a new and broader girdle and valve. But, as mentioned before, on the whole
the diameter of the cells of successive cultures showed a steady decrease. Thus, should
that phenomenon in fact represent a secondary growth, it might have slowed down
the rate of decrease of the size in the population but did not prevent it altogether.

C. radiatus Eur. has been cultured since 23 September 1935, when two cells were
isolated from a plankton sample. In February the average diameter of the cells was
1104, in August 694. No auxospores have been formed yet (November 1936).

Two lines of C. Granii Goucu have been kept in pure culture, one from 31 October
1935, the other from 11 March 1936. The diameter of the cells showed a steady
decrease, but in neither of the lines has auxospore formation been yet observed.
