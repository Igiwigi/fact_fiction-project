Thus the group of days of largest spot area contained 2°1 per cent. fewer “ quiet”
days, and 5°2 per cent. more disturbed days than the group of days of smallest spot
area.

§5. The fact that this second investigation gives at least a suggestion of the
relationship sought for, while the first investigation gave a purely negative result,
was at first very puzzling ; but it began to dawn on me that the difference might
have something to do with the fact that days of large spot area, and days of small
spot area both tend to congregate in groups, and not to be isolated. Influenced
partly by this idea, and partly by the desirability of testing a theory of ARRHENIUS,
who suggested that the magnetic disturbance effects visible on the earth, are due to
the discharge from the sun of electrified particles likely to take some 48 hours to
travel to the earth, I next investigated (in the same paper) whether the association
was not between magnetic phenomena on the earth and phenomena existing on the
sun, 1, 2, 3, or 4 days previously. In one investigation the 10 days of each month
were taken for which the absolute D range (7.e., the excess of the daily maximum over
the daily minimum declination) was greatest. Calling any one of these selected days
n, the Greenwich projected sunspot area was put down in separate columns for the
day n, and three previous days n—1, n—2, and n—3. This being done for each of
the 10 days of largest D range in the month, we have 10 spot areas in each of the
