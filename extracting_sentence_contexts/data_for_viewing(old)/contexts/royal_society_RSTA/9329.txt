permanent breakdown is due to rupture of fibrillee when alignment is complete. There
are certain difficulties in the way of this theory, one of which is that it would mean that
the fibrils of all animal hairs would have approximately the same dispersion, since all
the load/extension curves are typically the same. For an extension of 30 per cent. the
semi-angle of dispersion, ¢, assuming that the directions of the fibrils are distributed at
random within a cone of this semi-angle and that the thickness of a fibril is small
compared with its length, is given by

1-30 = ¢/sin ¢,

whence ¢=70°. This is greatly in excess of the dispersion of the spots of the
x-photograph and of the fibrils which were seen under the microscope in a chemically-
treated or diseased human hair ; in fact, these fibrils were almost parallel to the fibre
axis, and two isolated cortical cells, themselves built wp of fibrils, were some three hundred
times as long as they were broad.

The results of X-ray analysis offer what appears to be the true explanation of the
characteristic elastic properties of hair described above. We know (1) that dry hair
will not stretch much beyond 30 per cent. without rupture ; (2) that wet hair, if stretched
quickly enough and allowed to rest between successive extensions, may be stretched
repeatedly up to 30 per cent. without the occurrence of permanent internal breakage ;
(3) that all the load/extension curves with a quick rate of loading are similar and bend
over at about 30 per cent. extension; (4) that the X-ray photographs of unstretched
hairs are all similar and are all transformed, on stretching the hairs, into the interference
figure of a second phase which first becomes prominent in the region where internal
