the correction for distillation becomes negligible (see Section VII).

The steam points were observed in the same way as the other temperatures above
75° C., except that readings of the barometer replaced those of the resistance thermo-
meter. The barometer was observed at three-minute intervals commencing one or two
minutes before the thermometer readings and continuing for a similar period after-
wards. The barometric curve was plotted and each of the four observations (front,
back, front, back) was regarded as corresponding with the barometric height at the
mean time of the observation. Throughout the work the observations on the resistance
thermometers were made by the author, while all mercury thermometer readings were
taken by Mr. J. G. Dura, Senior Observer in the Physics Department. This
procedure was followed in view of the necessity for securing as high a speed of working
as possible, and of the-fact that Mr. Duruam’s long experience in mercury thermo-
meter observation made him peculiarly fitted for this section of the work. As a matter
of interest, at one temperature observations were made with the observers interchanged,
and all the values obtained agreed with those found by the normal procedure to
within 0-008° C.

The order of observation of steam points depended on convenience; for example,
thermometers which would not be required in the water bath for several weeks could be
