The galvanic current continued to give good contractions when directly applied to
the muscles, but now, when applied over the peripheral segment of the facial nerve,
the facial muscles were thrown into contractions. The faradie current now gave a
distinct contraction in the orbicularis palpebrarum when the electrode was applied to
the muscle directly, but in the other facial muscles no response was got by the
interrupted current. The upper and outer portion of the trapezius and the sterno-
mastoid were now giving slight contractions with the faradic current.

By the 123rd day there was still further improvement to record, for now the
appearance of unilateral facial paralysis when the face was in repose was much less,
although, on movements of the face being made, the paralysed condition was still
quite evident. The orbicularis palpebrarum remained much as at the 49th day. An
improvement, however, consisted in the fact that she was no longer troubled with
food lodging between the gums and cheek. When she lay down she could close the
eye fully.

By the 141st day the faradie irritability had improved, as now not only did the
orbicularis palpebrarum respond, but the angle of the mouth was drawn up on
applying the electrode.

At the 155th day the faradie irritability was very markedly improved, as now sharp
contractions were obtained when the electrode was applied to the lower lip, upper lip,
cheek, orbicularis palpebrarum, and brow. Also, on applying the electrode to a point
of the skin situated over the junction between spinal accessory and facial, the face
was thrown into contractions. The faradic irritability of the sterno-mastoid and
