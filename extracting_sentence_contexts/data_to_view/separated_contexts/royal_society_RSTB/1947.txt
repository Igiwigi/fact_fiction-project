But it may
be pointed out that, whatever the change may be, it can occur independently of the
sexual fusion, which occurs in fertilisation. This implies a modification of any view
of the necessary association of the origin of the second generation with the result
of fertilisation. The correlation of the double number of chromosomes with the

_ sporophyte might, in the light of the facts of induced apogamy, be regarded as due

to a subsequent association, and not as the fundamental fact in the origin of the
neutral generation. All speculation on these points must, however, be tentative until
the actual condition of matters in apogamy and apospory has been ascertained. Conclusion.
