coming to work out the results, however, it was found that either the conditions had
fluctuated more than had seemed likely at the time or that S. exspinosus was more
sensitive to changes than had been realised. This was shown by the following facts
concerning the monoclonal population. The 70 original ancestors of this population were all born within a period of about
20 hours. As the generations succeeded one another, however, the interval between
the birth of the first and last members of each generation lengthened out, so that in
Generation 5 this interval had reached the length of four days.
