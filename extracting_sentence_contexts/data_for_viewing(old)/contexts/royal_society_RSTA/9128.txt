is measured by the action line-element and the system of curves consists of all natural
trajectories of total energy h—that is, it consists of all the geodesics of the manifold.
The correspondence between points on the curves is fixed by the condition that the arc
O* P* should be equal to the arc OP, where O and O* are arbitrarily selected origins on the
undisturbed curve and any disturbed curve respectively. Thus the problem of stability
in the action sense is that of the convergence of geodesics in Riemannian space. If two
geodesics pass through adjacent points in nearly parallel directions, the distance between
points on the geodesics equidistant from the respective initial points is either permanently
small or not. If permanently small, there is stability. As simple examples we may quote
the great circles on a sphere as illustrating stability and the straight lines on a plane as
illustrating instability.

There is anlimportant fact (easily deducible from the calculus of variations) in the case
where the order of the disturbed curve is infinitesimal. It is that if O*O is perpendicular
to C, then so also is P*P, where P and P* are any pair of corresponding points. In con-
sidering stability in the action sense it is in general sufficient to consider only cases
where O*0 is perpendicular to C ; thus we may say that there is stability in the action
sense when every point of the disturbed geodesic is adjacent to the undisturbed geodesic.

Perpendicularity with respect to the action line-element is equivalent to perpendicu-
larity with respect to the kinematical line-element. Thus it appears that stability in
the action sense is equivalent to stability in the kinematico-statical sense for disturbances
which do not change the total energy, except in those cases where (h—V) either
becomes zero at some point of the undisturbed curve or tends to infinity.
