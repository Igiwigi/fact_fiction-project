Combining this with (4) and (6) above, we have,
6C-Base at Cambridge
= — 7866-2 + 0-135D before 10 January, 1934 |
= — 7851-6 — 0-011D after 10 January, 1934

Mean of 6A and 6C-Base at Cambridge
— — 7876-9 + 0-135D before 10 January, 1934 |
= — 7869-6 + 0:062D after 10 January, 1934 These expressions were adopted throughout* and the values in col. 21 of Table 1V
have been obtained from them. It is not supposed that the change in 6C took place
exactly in the manner assumed; in fact there is some evidence from fig. 4 that all
the change occurred between January and April, 1934; the assumed form of the
variation is, however, probably as near the truth as any other simple assumption. The change is not large ; if it had been neglected altogether and the simple mean
of the initial and final observations used throughout the adopted value of g would
at no station be changed by more than 0-002 cm/sec?.
