Similar consideration of figs. 9 and 11 shows that in the case of silver, as
begins to diminish from unity, the colour by transmitted light becomes at first bluer,
then changes to purple in the neighbourhood of y = ‘8, and thence, through pink, to
red or “amber” as » further diminishes to p = 0. In fact, it appears from the four
colours for which calculations have been made, that there is, for any value of p, a
well-defined absorption band at some position in the (visible or invisible) spectrum,
and that, as » diminishes, the position of this absorption band moves from the
infra-red through the visible spectrum towards the shorter wave-lengths, being
at 4 = °630 for ~ =about ‘83, at X= 589 for ~=about ‘80, at A= 500 for
p = about 69, and at A= 450 for ~ = about ‘55. Fig. 13 shows that the colour of
the reflected light becomes distinctly blue at about » = °75, and remains blue down
top =0.
