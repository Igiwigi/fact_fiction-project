Call the point in which each line meets

= the plane of the curve the foot of this line, then the line joining the two feet meets the

Z.curve in m points; and it is in respect of each of these .points a generating line of the

2 8croll; that is, it is an m-tuple generating line: the section of the scroll by the plane of

3 the curve m2 is in fact this line counting m times, and the curye m; m+m=2m, the

Sorder of the scroll. And in like manner the section by any plane through the m-tuple
S line is this line counting m times, and a curye of the order m not meeting either of the

Sdirectrix lines. But the section by any other plane is a curve of the order 27 meeting

E each of the directrix lines in a point which is an m-tuple point of the section (each direc-

& trix line is in fact an m-tuple line of the scroll) ; and by considering, in place of the par-

6 ticular section m, this general section, we have the scroll of the order 217 in the form

S S$(1, 1, 2m), where the two directrix lines each meet the section m times; s0 that the
order is 4M —m—Mm=2m. A 8. Andso in general, m being a plane curve, when the scroll $(1, 1, m) is of an order
8uperior to m, 8ay =m+#h, this only means that the section chosen for the directrix
curve m is not the complete section by the plane of such curve, but that the line join-
ing the feet of the two directrix lines is a {-tuple generating line of the scroll, and that
the complete section is made up of this line counting & times and of the curve mm.
