the same strong nitric acid; for the first instant, the iron was positive ; the moment
after, the silver became positive, and continued 80, A similar association of iron and
silver was put into weak nitric acid, and the iron was immediately positive, and con-
tinued 80. With iron and copper the same results were obtained.

2001. These, therefore, are finally cases of such an inversion (1999.) ; but as the
iron in the strong nitric acid acquires a state the moment after its immersion, which
is probably not assumed by it in the weak acid (1843. 1951. 2033.), and as the action
on the iron in its ordinary state may be said to be, to render it positive to the silver
or copper, both in the strong or weak acid, we will not endeavour to force the fact,
but look to other metals.

2002. Silver and nickel being associated in weak nitric acid, the nickel was posi-
tive; being associated in strong nitric acid, the nickel was still positive at the first
moment, but the silyer was finally positive. The nickel lost its superiority throngh
the influence of an investing film (1918.); and though the effect might easily pass
unobserved, the case cannot be allowed to stand, as fulfilling the statement made
(1999.).

2003. Copper and nickel were put into strong nitric acid ; the copper was poxitive
from the firs; moment. Copper and nickel being in dilute nitric acid, the nickel was
slightly but clearly positive to the copper. Again, zinc and cadmium. in strong nitric
