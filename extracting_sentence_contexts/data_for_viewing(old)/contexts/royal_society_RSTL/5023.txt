eventuates in the evolution of pigment. In other language, the walls of the blood-
vessels, under the cireumstances indicated, accomplish what in the instances of Glycera
alba and Clymene arenicoida, and it, may be prophetically added in all Vertebrata, is
performed by the involucra, the cell-capsules of the floating corpuscles. One other
lesson of extreme value is read to the zoo-chemist by the history of the blood in the
Annelida. It is a limpid, non-corpusculated coloured fluid. In many species it

alone is submitted to the process of atration. Therefore the agency of the floating
corpuseles is not essential to the respiratory action of oxygen on the blood. This
fact, which is unequivocal, is promissory of future discoveries.

Relation between the Blood-proper and Peritoneal Fluid â€”The physiologist cannot
view with unconcern the question which relates to the mode in which the two fluids
now described in the Annelida stand related to each other. It is scarcely required
to observe, that what applies under this head to the Annelida will prove no less appli-
cable to the Entozoa and Echinoderms, in which also these two varieties of nutrient
fluids coexist in the same individual.

In all Annelida a peculiar and express disposition of the blood-vessels is observable,
by which an extensive contact is secured between the blood-proper and the fluid of
the visceral cavity. 'This arrangement is $0 strikingly a provision for the attainment
of a, particular object that it cannot be misinterpreted. In the anatomy of the Nais
