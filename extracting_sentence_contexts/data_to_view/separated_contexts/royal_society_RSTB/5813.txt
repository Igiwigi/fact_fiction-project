In making these statements, allowance has been made
for the fact that the angles P,-wound, as measured, were probably about 3Â°-5 too small,
on account of the shift of the growing-point (see section 5). In the previous experiments, in which I,a arose it was found that its centre was dis-
placed far enough to allow room for its kathodic stipule. Similarly in the present
experiments the centre of I,k was usually displaced far enough from the wound to allow
room for its anodic stipule, In five experiments, however, its anodic stipule was
abnormally small, a fact of which the explanation will be considered in the next section. In nine of the experiments of this group the sequence of the leaves I,k and I, was
reversed, I, arising before I,k. None the less it will be convenient to call this leaf I,k
. even when it arose after I, The experiments may conveniently be divided into two
sub-groups.
