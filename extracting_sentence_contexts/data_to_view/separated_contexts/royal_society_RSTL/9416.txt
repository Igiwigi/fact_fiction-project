In proof of this point I may allude particularly to the observations which are
detailed in V., $ 1 (a), (b), and (c) of my sccond paper. f As the effects of temperature in modifying the rate of artificial rhythm no doubt avise from the effects
of temperature on modifying the excitability of the contractile tissues, I think it is desirable here again to
mention a fact which was briefly stated in my second paper (p. 691), viz. : that in the excitable tiszues
