I think it would be difficult to overrate the importance of these results: to my mind
they are perhaps the most interesting which are contained in this paper. They not only
prove that curare poison is consistent in manifesting its remarkable property when
applied to these the lowest forms of life that present the beginnings of a nervous system ;
but they prove what is far more important, that in animals which, as we haye seen from
other evidence, present us with the firs: indications of a neryous system, the latter
appears to have already undergone a differentiation in its functions, such that it is
capable not only of influencing contiguous contractile parts, but also of being influenced
by distant excitable parts.

(e) I hall conclude all T have to say at the present time upon the subject of poisons
by stating the interesting fact, that if any of the narcotic or anzsthesiating agents
be administered to any portion of a contractile strip cut from the gonocalyx of
Aurelia aurita in the way already described, the rate of the contractile waves Is
at first progressively slowed (I shall give the actual tracings in a future paper), and
eventually their pasage is completely blocked at the line where the poisoned water
begins. Upon now restoring the poisoned portion of the contractile strip to normal

sea-water the blocking is gradually overcome, and eventually every trace of it dis-
appears. This experiment was suggested to me by Dr. BurDox SANDERSON ®.
