into a stochastic conservation law. Because spontaneously stochastic world lines in relativistic
turbulence must remain within the light-cone, no acausal effects such as produced by ‘eddy
resistivity’ will be predicted. Our approach is based on fundamental scientific progress in the
understanding of turbulence, not on engineering parametrizations.

(b) Goldreich—Sridhar turbulence and turbulent reconnection

GS95 turbulence is a theory accepted by a substantial part of the astrophysical community
(see [93,95] for reviews). Born outside the mainstream community of turbulence experts, it was
initially mostly ignored'* but then was accepted under the pressure of numerical results. As we
mentioned, the debates are not settled about the validity of possible modifications of the model.
In parallel, some part of the community is still using the so-called two-dimensional plus slab
model of turbulence [182] in spite of the fact that it has no support via numerical simulations
with isotropic driving. We consider the latter as some parametrization of the actual heliospheric
turbulence over a limited range. This parametrization is not physically or numerically motivated
and therefore is not considered within the reconnection model.

The LV99 and our subsequent studies mentioned in the review employed GS95 model.
However, we stress again that none of our principal results on fast turbulent reconnection and
the physics of turbulent reconnection will be changed if instead of GS95 any other existing model
of strong MHD turbulence is used, provided that this model satisfies the constraints that are
given by the existing numerical simulations. The corresponding expressions for reconnection
rates obtained a wide variety of turbulence indexes are provided in LV99. At the same time, we
discussed in the review that fast LV99 reconnection makes the GS95 model self-consistent.
