physical systems through both observation and numerical computation, e.g. [38-40], and its
significance as a robust phenomenon is now well established [28].

Spatially localized states are also present in other bistable situations, typified by an S-shaped
branch of spatially uniform states, with two stable states separated by an unstable state between

a lower fold on the right and an upper fold on the left [41,42]. In this case, both folds give rise : =
to LSs [43], ‘holes’ in the upper uniform state arising from the top left fold and ‘bumps’ on the : S
lower uniform state arising from the fold at the bottom right. When followed numerically, using 2
numerical continuation, these structures also localize, with the holes deepening and the bumps aed
increasing in amplitude, with both growing in extent until the hole is so broad that, with periodic 22
boundary conditions, the resulting state looks like a bump and vice versa. Similar behaviour in [4
fact occurs in the bistable Swift-Hohenberg equation as well, where the fold in the periodic state is : =
responsible for the appearance of a hole in that state that connects, again with periodic boundary : =
conditions, with the LS created in the primary Turing instability. The reason for the appearance (Ss

of LSs near bifurcations is simple: near a bifurcation perturbations grow slowly (|Re(@)| « 1) and
this growth can be balanced by both small nonlinearities and weak, i.e. large scale, diffusion. In
the subcritical case, the latter may balance even in the time-independent case and stationary LSs
become possible.

In this paper, we use the following version of the GS model in one spatial dimension:

W: =dWyx — WB? — W +a (1.1)
By = Byx + WB? — mB. (1.2)
