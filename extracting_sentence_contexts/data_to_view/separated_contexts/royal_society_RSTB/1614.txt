ordinary locomotion from exerting any influence on an air-bladdey so closely related.
to the skeleton, and secondarily on the Weberian ossicles, a more or less extensive
anchylosis of the anterior vertebrae takes place, as well as a more rigid and intimate
articulation with the skull than is usnally the case in other Ostariophysea The
necessity for a more rigid connection between the skull and the vertebral coluwim has
probably conditioned further modifications in the anterior vertebra, und may well
have been one of the eauses which have hastened the further atrophy of those rudi-
meutary’ vertebral centra that intervene between the basinecipital and the fourth
vertebra, and haye been partially dismembered in the formation of the different
Weberian ossicles from certain of their constitnent elements, The shortening of this
section of the vertebra] eolamn necessarily involves the bripus taking » position more
anterior than that which it occupies in the Cyprinids and exactly opposite the
acaphiom, with the final result. that the iniercalarium becomes useless as u sesamoid
ossicle, and degenerates to the insignificant and yartbly developed vestige by which
ilous it is yepresented tn the great majority of the Siluvidis,

the Cyprinidi in so far us the points now under disvussion are concerned, and of the
Gyronotidse it may be said that they exhibit a somewhat less specialized condition of
the ai-bladder and Weberian ossicles than any of the preceding families, although
Abviously related to the Cyprinoid type.

an considering, from a physiological point of view, the significance of the structural
Bilifications presented by the air-bladder and its adjuncts in this section of the
Baily, we may, in the first place, briefly capitulate certain anatomical facts already
ig@utioned in a previous section of this paper.
gApart from a very considerable reduction, both in absolute and relative size, the
a@sence of lateral chambers and the persistence of the anterior chamber only, the most
wteworthy features in the air-bladder of the various genera of Siluridse abnovmales
aze—its constriction, partial or complete, into two laterally-situated nir-sacs, which may
ngt only lose all connection with each other, but with the esophagus also; the
tendency of the air-sues to become more or less completely enclosed within variously-
famed hony capsules; the occasional atrophy of the ductus pneumaticus, or its persis-
ce asa solid fibrous cord ; aud frequently also, in addition, the more or less complete
ply of the fibres which normally form the dorsal walls of lateral halves of the
Fldlder, und connect the lateral walls with the crescentic processes of the tripodes. To these may be added the partial solidification of the organ in certain species, either
through the thickening and matting together of its walls, or the development of
intsrnal fibrous trabecule, or through the partial obliteration of ils cavity through
the growth of a thick central column of fibres.
