It is remarkable that
neither of these two accomplished men made any allowance in their observations for the
= membranes and fluids. This might not be deemed necessary in the comparison of the

'Z relative size of the cranial cavity in different races, aimed at by the former, who, when

=

S he subjected the brain to the weighing process, divested it of the arachnoid and the
S pia mater. The latter observer might seem to have overlooked the need of any allow-
2 ance; at all events, in his Memoirf, he tells us that by his process of gauging the cavity

of the skull with leaden shot, I thus obtain the absolute capacity of the cranium, or
© bulk of the brain, in cubic inches; ” and he describes his great Table as © showing the
S size of the brain in cubic inches ”—whereas, in fact, it merely gives the capacity of 623
A crania in cubic inches. It is quite needless to endeayour to prove that an allowance for
"4 membranes and fluids is absolutely necessary. £ Attempts have been made by different observers to determine the proportion in weight
= by which the brains of men exceed those of women.
