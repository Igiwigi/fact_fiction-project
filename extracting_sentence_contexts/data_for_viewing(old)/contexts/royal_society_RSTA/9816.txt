If the normal D,, (2) = 7A = 939078, the order difference over D,, (3) would be
939078—888643 (89) = 50435489, and 3343 = 134d, = 50495, so that the order
difference would come out as usual a close multiple of 6, All this group seem to
show the same kind of irregularity.

O. There are three separate series, see data for Table IL., differing by multiples of
A,, just as in the order differences. A, is too small to test the multiples of the
denominators themselves. i

S. The D(2), D(3) lines for S and Se are beyond observed regions. Sulphur
however shows no satellites, and we may surmise therefore in analogy with others
that the differences for D (2), D(3), D (4) are like the others multiples of A, or A,.
As a fact, D,(4) is a clear multiple of A,, and the surmise is justified so far as A, is
concerned. The value of ¢ is not very certain.

Se. Se apparently has satellites, and the order differences are only multiples of 6.
It should not therefore be expected that D, (4) or D,(4) should be a multiple of A).
Nevertheless D, (4) is clearly such a multiple and is entered in the table.


376 DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES.

The table shows that where triplets occur the multiples are those of A, and not of
A,, except in the case of the oxygen group of elements, in which A, clearly takes the
place of A,. If the law of multiples is correct, the values of the A obtained in this
