Remarks. â€”This case shows very clearly that a lesion of the cortex in the region
where electrical irritation causes movements of the opposite leg, gives rise to a
permanent monoplegia of this limb ; the affection being one purely of motor power
without loss of sensation. The lesion did not involve the whole of the cortical region,
irritation of which causes movements of the opposite leg, nor was the paralysis of the
leg absolute, nor did ib affect all movements equally. Those most affected were the
movements of the foot. The case further demonstrates the important fact that a
purely cortical lesion is followed by descending degeneration through the whole

region whence the motor roots of the limb emerge.

It was noted that for several days subsequent to the operation a s
