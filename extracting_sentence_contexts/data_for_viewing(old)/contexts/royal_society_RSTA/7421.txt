general solution of (8-2°5)

t 5
A= (2) {K, cos g(59, 5) + Ky sin g(5p, 5)}. (8-2-7)

+ The point s, will usually be the position of burnt, but is used here for the end-point of the arc of the
trajectory which it is desired to investigate.


542 R. A. RANKIN ON THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY

This solution is, of course, only approximate; it can be verified by differentiation that it
is in fact the general solution of the modified equation

TH + (G() +6*(s)}H =0.

The function [G,/G]* and all other fourth roots appearing later on are uniquely defined
because of the property (c) of G(s).

In order to obtain the general solution of (8-2:1) from the solution of (8-2-5) we must find
the Wronskian of the two functions

H® = (22) cosets S\ 0 SG) a (€23)'sing(ss)

It is HOH® — H® H® = Gf.
