possessed by this source of electricity does not arise from its high or low potential, for
we have seen that the potential does not affect the power of the conducting system to
influence the luminous discharge ; nor, as we have also 8een, would mere fluctuations
of potential in the wire produce any other than the relief-effect, or interfere with or
destroy it, unless they were of like period with the pulsations in the tube. Hence the
special effect in question must be due to the fact that connexion with the air-spark
terminal interferes in a special manner with the electrical state of the tinfoil, and the
peculiarity must consist in the fact that the period of the charges (and consequent
variations of potential) is such that they keep time with the pulsations in the tube.

Now the displacement of electricity, which would otherwise give the standard relief-
effect, may be interfered with either by exaltation, or by reversal, or by diminution.
The last alternative is excluded by the experimental fact that these special or non-
relief-effects do not resemble any of the series of relief-effects which we have described,
and which range from zero to the complete to-earth effect.

To decide between the remaining alternatives we may adopt a similar course. Like
the relief-effect, the special or non-relief-effect, may be obtained in other than the
complete form we have already described. In that form a piece of tinfoil placed upon
the tube is connected with the air-spark terminal. If, instead of resting on the tube,
the tinfoil (still connected with the air-spark terminal) be fastened to an insulated rod
and made to approach the tube, a series of special effects are produced which pass from
zero to the complete non-relief-effect. Now if this complete non-reliet-eftect were
merely an intensification of the relief-effects we should expect to obtain the ordinary
relief-effects, or some close approximation to them, at some part of this chain of special
