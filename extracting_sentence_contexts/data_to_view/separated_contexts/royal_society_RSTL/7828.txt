But I recently examined the specimen which is, or
was, in the Strasburg Museum, and I satisfied myself that the supposed sheath is a mere
yerticil of leayes; a conclusion in which its eminent custodian, Professor ScuneeR, fully
agreed with me. Consequently the fact must be admitted, that one of the universally
existent features of recent Equisetaceous plants does not appear in the fossil Calamites. In his description of his Volkmannia Binneyii Mr. CarrRUTHERS announces the dis-
covery of spores with attached elaters, and on the strength of this supposed fact he
further rests his conclusion that the Calamites are Equisetacee. But to this I enter-
tain two objections. I have not seen Mr. CARRUTHERS's specimen, but I have made 8ec-
tions of and examined a considerable number of strobili of the same species; and though
I find spores in abundance, I have failed to detect a solitary example furnished with ela-
ters.
