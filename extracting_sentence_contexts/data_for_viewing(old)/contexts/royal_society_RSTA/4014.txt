this technique without a normalizing factor to correct for MEs in various biological samples.
The reconstructed chromatograms after ME compensation were similar for all matrices resulting
in an improved precision, accuracy and dynamic range during method validation [145].

4. Applications

MS, and in particular LC-MS, has been used in various fields of pharmaceutical research.
Quantitative measurements are extremely important in toxicological studies, whether it concerns
clinical studies, impurity profiling, doping control analysis or the presence of pharmaceuticals
in foods and beverages. Another emerging field wherein pharmaceuticals and their derivatives
such as metabolites and degradation products are quantified using MS is environmental science,
especially water analysis. Furthermore, MS is also used in pharmacokinetic studies, drug
discovery, biopharmacy and radiopharmacy [132,158,159]. In fact, in more than 95% of all
cases quantitation of pharmaceutical products is done using MS when complex matrices hinder
a reliable spectrophotometric quantification. For this reason, the use of MS for quantitative
pharmaceutical analysis is a well discussed subject in the literature. Electronic supplementary
material, table S2 provides a general overview of recently published review articles in which
different topics are discussed. Because imaging, proteomics and metabolomics are very specific
fields of research, their applications are not included.

As can be seen from electronic supplementary material, table S3, wherein a selection of
different recent applications in quantitative pharmaceutical analysis using MS is provided,
environmental studies are mainly focused on multi-residue analysis. Pharmaceuticals are
considered emerging contaminants and are therefore analysed together with other pollutants
such as personal care products and pesticides. Wode et al. [160] were able to analyse more
