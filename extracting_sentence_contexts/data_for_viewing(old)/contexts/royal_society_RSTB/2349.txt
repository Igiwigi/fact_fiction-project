But if the limitations to the absorption of carbon dioxide are not to be found
in any imperfections of the stomatal apparatus of the leaf, we must seek them
elsewhere.

The first explanation which naturally suggests itself is that, in the particular case
we are considering, the chlorophyll bodies are performing the maximum amount of
work of which they are capable, and that the "134 cub. centim. of gas absorbed by
the sq. centim. of leaf per hour is a measure of the maximum elaborative power of
the assimilatory centres. Such, however, cannot be the true explanation, since with
good illumination the power of assimilation, within certain limits, is always found to
increase with every slight increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the outer air.
We shall in fact show in a subsequent paper that there is within these limits a
remarkable quantitative correspondence between increased pressure of CO, and
increased assimilation.

The restriction in the absorption of the gas by the leaf must rather be sought in
the difficulty which the gaseous carbon dioxide experiences in passing from the

to 35 of their maximum and yet still allow a sufficient amount of CO, to pass for the maximum observed

assimilation, providing the absorption were perfect. This is an important fact, when we bear in mind the
rile which the stomates play in transpiration.
