I have seen the
pattern in the sky associated closely with transverse rolls and disposed diagonally to
them, but unfortunately a photograph taken of the cloud was not very satisfactory. The square pattern is often seen in a lenticular cloud bank, as shown by CuarKE,*
arranged with the diagonals along the long axis of the bank. In view of the fact that
in cloud banks of this type ripples are often seen which are clearly transverse to the
shear and are parallel to one set of diagonals, there is little doubt that the square pattern
is often aligned this way in the sky. The “transitional” pattern of fig. 6 also occurs in the sky; examples of this are
shown by Ciarke, Plate 18 6, and in fig. 22, Plate 5, in this paper; this cloud form
has been seen to develop into the rectangular pattern. In the laboratory there is a greater tendency to form cells having descent in the
centres in a layer of air while in the sky both ascent and descent are found.
