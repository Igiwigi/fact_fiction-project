Rather, it is determined by the joint dynamical evolution of the S U S’ quantum system. In
physicists’ parlance: quantum theory predicts interference effects between the different branches
corresponding to different values of the variable a, as if no actualization had happened. We have thus to combine the presence of these interference effects (which pushes us to say that
a had no value) with the fact that the variable a does take a value.!

1m Many World interpretations, a takes a value indexically relative to a world; in Bohm-like theories only an (abelian)
subset of variables has value, not all of them; in Quantum Information interpretations, a takes a value only when the
interaction is with the idealistic holder of the information; in Copenhager-like interpretations, when the interaction is with
the ‘classical world’; in Physical Collapse theories, when some not yet directly observed random physical phenomenon
happens. ... The answer of relational QM is that the variable a of the system S actualized in the interaction
with S’ takes value with respect to S’, but not with respect to S’. This is the core idea underlying the
‘relational’ interpretation of QM.
