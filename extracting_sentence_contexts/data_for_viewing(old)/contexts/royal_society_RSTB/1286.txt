this is probably due to the facts (1) that there is no clearly defined tapett

are in this respect the most difficult family of the Vascular Cryptogams.
The subsequent stages of development are illustrated by figs. 136-138, and

first composed of uniform cells. The wall of the synangium meanwhile }

cells of the sporogenous mass (fig, 138), so that it is almost impossible to ree

portions of the latter become disorganized without the formation of spores, bu
