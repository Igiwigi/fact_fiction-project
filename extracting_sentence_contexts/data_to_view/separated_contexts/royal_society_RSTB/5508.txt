3, 6and 9). If we compare Srieve’s embryo
(text-fig. 3) with embryo Bi24 (text-fig. 4), we notice that the former is slightly longer,
but very much broader than the latter, at the same time Bi24 is certainly more
differentiated. Again, if we compare Waupryer’s embryo with the Dobbin embryo,
we observe the same fact: the length of both is practically the same, but the former
is much broader than the latter, and the head-process is certainly much less developed. Again, if we compare the Dobbin embryo with RosseNnBECK’s specimen, we see only a
slight difference in the differentiation of the axial structures, but a very marked
difference in size, especially in breadth. These observations suggest that there may
be two different forms of the human embryonal area: one small and comparatively
narrow (what we may call a dwarf form), the other large and comparatively broad
(what we may call a giant form).
