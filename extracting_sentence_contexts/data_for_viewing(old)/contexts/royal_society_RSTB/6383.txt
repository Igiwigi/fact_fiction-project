and the rate of differentiation of the chordate larval structures. The rate of all
these is retarded by a uniform increase in yolk/cytoplasm ratio of the egg. The
yolk is merely a hindrance to the development of the larval structure.

The developing trunk or permanent tissues are, on the other hand, very differently
affected. Their early development up to and including gastrulation is retarded
equally with the larval tissues, but the tendency for cell-division in the larger embryos
of group one to accelerate progressively thereafter becomes much more striking.
Two factors enter, the increase in relative amount of yolk allows a larger number of
cells to be formed before functional and structural differentiation is necessitated,
and the retardation or prolongation of the development of the larval structures
enables the permanent tissues to attain a relatively advanced developmental stage
by the time the tadpole is fully formed. There is, in fact, a telescoping of the develop-
ment of the larval and adult organization owing to the retardation of the rate of
development of the former. Compared with the tadpole of Polycarpa, those of
Molgula complanata and M. citrina have identical larval structures but have trunk
regions exhibiting growth in size and possessing a far greater number of cells. It is
of interest that in spite of the great difference in duration of embryonic development
between Polycarpa and the above-mentioned species of Molgula, the time from
fertilization to the formation of a miniature adult with functional heart and stigmata
is practically the same. The tadpole stage of Molgula is in effect prolonged into the
post-larval phase. The morphological differences between the tadpoles of Polycarpa
and these particular species of Molgula are, however, not very striking. They
consist mainly of differences in cell-number of the trunk tissues. This may be
because the eggs are relatively small and the number of cells formed even in the
