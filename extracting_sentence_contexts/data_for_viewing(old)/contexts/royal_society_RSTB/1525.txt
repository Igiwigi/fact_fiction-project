lesion, and it is further possible to detect that when the animal falls, the posterior
extremity on the side of the lesion is that which gives way first. Later, the animal
becomes quite active, and walks and even runs about in an uncertain and ataxic
manner, repeatedly falling on to its left side owing to the limbs on that side not
being properly under the animal’s control. The motor paresis does not affect all the
limbs equally, but is most marked in the posterior extremity on the side of the
lesion, less marked in the anterior extremity of the same side, and still less marked
in the opposite posterior extremity, while the opposite anterior extremity appears to
escape entirely. And, as has already been said, when power is being regained in the
extremities the posterior extremity on the side of the lesion is that in which it
is last restored.

Ocular Displacements.—Few facts in connection with the results of division of
one inferior peduncle of the cerebellum are more definite than is the displacement of
the globes which is to be seen after such a lesion. After the animal has recovered
from the effects of the anzesthetic, both eyes are seen to be displaced downwards and
to the opposite side from that on which the peduncle has been divided. If the left
peduncle is divided, the displacement of the right eye is unquestionably greater than
that of the left, especially as regards the degree of its displacement to the right ; but
in this connection, it has to be remembered that in the dog more sclerotic is visible
on the inner than on the outer side of the cornea, and that, therefore, any displace-
ment of the eye outward obtrudes itself on the observer more than does any
displacement of the eye inward. Allowing for this source of fallacy, however, I still
feel justified in stating that after division of one inferior peduncle the outward
displacement of the opposite eye is greater than the inward displacement of the eye
