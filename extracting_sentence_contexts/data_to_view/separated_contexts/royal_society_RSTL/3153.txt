(The obseryations with the dipping-needle and large magnets on shore will be de-
ferred to another part of this paper.)

Section IIIL.â€”Theory of Induced Magnetism. The fundamental supposition of the theory on which T shall found the calculations
in the following pages is, that, by the action of terrestrial magnetism, every particle
of iron is converted into a magnet whose direction is parallel to that of the dipping-
needle, and whose intensity is proportional to the intensity of terrestrial magnetism :
the upper end having the property of attracting the north end of the needle, and the
lower end that of repelling it. It would have been desirable to make the calculations on PorssoNn's theory, which
undoubtedly possesses greater claims on our attention, as a theory representing ac-

urately the facts of some very peculiar cases, than any other. The difficulties, how-
ever, in the application of that theory to complicated cases, are great, perhaps insu-
perable. And in ordinary cases, the simpler theory that I have mentioned will give
the same comparative though not the same absolute results.
