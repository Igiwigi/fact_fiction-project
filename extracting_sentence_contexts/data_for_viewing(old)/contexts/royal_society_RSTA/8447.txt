worth noting that the change with atomic number (i.¢., increasing ionisation) in any one
sequence brings the value of 2s below that of the d level by about the third stage of
ionisation. Another relationship we expect to be fulfilled is due to the fact that the
1s — 2p, line shows a linear progression with Z. This we saw in § 4 involves the law

Vv (1s) — V/v (2p) = constant.

The two tests of our scheme are not quite equivalent, for in one test we use only
