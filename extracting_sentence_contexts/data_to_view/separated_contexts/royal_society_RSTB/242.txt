If it had not been developed, or had not been in bony union with the
skull, then the head would have terminated posteriorly in two occipital condyles
formed by the ex-occipital bones, between which there would be an inferior notch. Such a hypothetical condition is so suggestive of the Labyrinthodont mode of union
of the skull with the vertebral column, as to indicate a possible method of transition
from the Amphibian form of occipital condyle to such a type as is seen in Chelonian
Reptiles by the blending of a notochordal ossification with the head. If we consider
the structure of an Amphibian skull, there can be no @ priori difficulty from the fact
= that it would bring the ex-occipital bones to some extent into bony union with the
basi-sphenoid ; but the posterior pre-condylar surface of these bones, which is in front
of the basi-occipital, appears to project posteriorly for 15 millims. beyond the basi-
sphenoid. The basi-sphenoid (bs) is partially blended with the pterygoid bone (pt), and the
prominent oblong bony mass at the back of the palate is about 9 centims. long. Its external or lateral surfaces are concave in length, so as to constrict the transverse
measurement to 5 céntims. towards the anterior end, but posteriorly the bone widens,
; attaining a transverse measurement of about 8 centims., and terminating in two
parallel convex bosses which are below and in front of the occipital condyle.
