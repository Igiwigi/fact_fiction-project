times from the ocean into the Mediterranean, which current,
I am informed, is 80 strong at Gibraltar, as to carry a ship at
the rate of two or three miles an hour; and it is felt as far
eastward as the Cap de Gat, a distance of upwards of one
hundred and fifty miles; so that ships going out of the Me-
diterranean, scarcely ever attempt to beat out against contrary
winds, and usually keep close either to the African or Euro-
pean shore, in order to avoid the full force of the stream.

If this hypothesis, however, of a disproportion between the
loss of water produced by evaporation, and the inadequate
compensation afforded by the ingress of rivers, be founded in
fact; and if this deficiency be replenished by the saline waters
of the ocean, it will be necessary to explain why the waters
of the Mediterranean do not gradually increase in saltness,
and indeed how it happens that they are not ultimately con-
verted into a saturated brine. It has been supposed, in order
toremove this difficulty, that an under-current of water, salter
than the ocean, runs out of the Mediterranean at the Straits
