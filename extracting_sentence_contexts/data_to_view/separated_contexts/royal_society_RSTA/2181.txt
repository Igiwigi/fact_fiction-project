Figure 3 shows snapshots of the scattering for an untwisted MM, while
figure 4 shows the scattering when the MM. are twisted (y =z). In the untwisted case, the MM
annihilate, while in the twisted case they come close but not close enough to annihilate. In fact,
they bounce back as seen in figure 5.

(). MM creation

Next, we discuss the creation of MM. The issue is that monopoles are described as solutions to
the classical equations of motion, while particles are quanta in a quantum field theory.
