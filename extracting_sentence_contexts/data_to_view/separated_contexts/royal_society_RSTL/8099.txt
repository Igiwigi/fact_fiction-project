Strontic Chloride gives the bands very brightly at first, but not s0 brightly after a
time; 4607-5 is fainter, but is very distinct. 1N CONNEXION WITH THE SPECTRUM OF THE SUN. 645

Strontic Fluoride refused to give any trace either of the strontium or compound spec-
trum ; it is, in fact, only capable of being heated to a white heat and giving a continuous

spectrum,
CONCLUSIONS. It is to be observed, then, that when the spectra before referred to produced by flames
are compared with those produced by the low-tension spark, the spectra of the metals
in the combination are in the former case invariably more simple than in the latter, and
that they are 8implified to such an extent that only the very longest line is Toft ; thus: â€”

Barie Todide with the low-tension spark gives five and twenty lines. In the flame it

<8ives but one, and that the longest, namely 5534-5.

S Baric Bromide gives five and twenty lines with the spark ; only one in the flame, the
28ame longest line 5534-5.

Z Barie Chloride five and twenty lines in spark and one, 5534-5, in flame.
