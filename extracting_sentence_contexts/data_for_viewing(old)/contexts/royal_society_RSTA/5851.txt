the universal covering space of M is contractible and, in this case, known to be diffeomorphic
to RS [6]. Since the higher homotopy groups, 7;(M) for i> 1 can be interpreted as the homotopy
classes of continuous maps S! — M, each such map must be homotopic to a constant map. For
this reason, K(sr, 1) manifolds are said to be aspherical.

This general class of K(z, 1) manifolds includes, as special cases, the 3-torus and five additional
manifolds, finitely covered by the torus, that are said to be of ‘flat type’ since they are the only
compact, connected, orientable 3-manifolds that each, individually, admits a flat metric and thus
supports spatially compactified versions of the FLRW spaces of flat type (i.e. k = 0 models).

Other K(r, 1) spaces include the vast set of compact hyperbolic manifolds H?/I, where here
I is a discrete torsion-free (i.e. no non-trivial element has finite order) co-compact subgroup of
the Lie group Isom*(H®) of orientation-preserving isometries of H® that, in fact, is Lie-group
isomorphic to the proper orthochronous Lorentz group SO*(3,1). Each of these, individually,
supports spatially compactified versions of the FLRW space-times of constant negative (spatial)
curvature (i.e. k = —1 models).

Additional K(z,1) manifolds include the trivial circle bundles over higher genus surfaces Zp
for p>2 (where Lp designates a compact, connected, orientable surface of genus p) and non-
trivial circle bundles over Zp for p = 1. Note that the trivial circle bundles S? x Sl and T? x S! =
T° are already included among the previous prime factors discussed and that non-trivial circle
bundles over S? are included among the spherical space forms S3/I for suitable choices of I’.
Still further examples of K(z,1) manifolds are compact 3-manifolds that fibre non-trivially over
the circle with fibre 2, for p>1. Any such manifold is obtained by identifying the boundary
components of [0,1] x 2» with a (non-trivial) orientation-reversing diffeomorphism of Zp.
