the consequences of which will be discussed in §4.
Returning to (3.8), for any > hyn, the sharpest bound on C(h), uniform in n, m comes from
the values m =n =1, leading to

C(h)>1—3h, with C(tmin) > d. (3.11)

The result C(/min) = 4 looks unusual but has a very low probability of occurrence. It is indeed one
of the features allowed by Large Deviation Theory [3].

The first inequality in (3.11) is the same as that derived from the four-fifths law [14]. The
second inequality C(imin) = 4 also provides a bound on the probability of observing the smallest
exponent which has a very low probability of occurrence [18]. Note that for d= 3, the condition
for n=m=1 reflects the fact that the energy dissipation is bounded, as stressed in [16]. Thus,
we can say that while the hierarchy of bounds derived in theorem 1 gives a lower bound? on h,
which is expressed in (3.9), the lower bound C(h) in (3.11) is no better than that derived from the
four-fifths law.

We see also that the exponent corresponding to Leray scaling, namely Imin = —1, is only
achieved at the singular dimension d=4. All the constraints on the multifractal spectrum are
assembled in figure 1. Thanks to this, we can also place it in the context of the classical multifractal
models, such as the lognormal model [26]

(h — 1/3 — 3b/2)?

C(h) = 7 , (3.12)
