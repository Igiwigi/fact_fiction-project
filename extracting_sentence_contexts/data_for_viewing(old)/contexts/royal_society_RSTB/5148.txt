378 CATHERINE J. HILL ON A CONTRIBUTION TO

Ina recent paper Ranson (55) has reviewed our knowledge of the physiological nature
of the intestinal reflexes, and accepts the view that whilst many of the reflexes are
controlled by the extrinsic nerves, others such as the myenteric reflex are carried out
entirely by the intrinsic nervous mechanism, and persist after all extrinsic nerves to the
gut have been severed (BAytiss and Srarwine (3) ). The question then arises as to the
mechanism of these movements of the digestive tract. How are they initiated, and by
what means are they carried out ? The experimental data available indicate that the
thythmical movements of smooth muscle are myogenic in origin, and this fact,
originally demonstrated by ENGELMANN, has received confirmation from many workers.
Bayuiss and Srariine found that a solution of nicotine of sufficient strength to paralyse
the ganglia abolished the myenteric reflex and left the rhythmical contractions unaffected.
FiercHer (26) confirmed this statement when he showed that the retractor penis
muscle of the dog and cat, which is said to contain no nerve cells, undergoes rhythmical
movements when removed from the animal, and further confirmation is afforded by the
investigations of Gunn and Unprrutt (27), ALvaAREzZ and Manonry (2). Maenus (47)
at one time believed that these contractions were neurogenic in origin, and claimed
that by removing all traces of AUERBACHâ€™s plexus the rhythmical movements were
abolished. Later (48), however, he satisfied himself as to the myogenic nature of the
contractions.
