Since this is the simplest tensor form that
we can take, it is quite natural for us to assume that the stress-strain relations are
governed by equations of the above type.

6— Object of the Paper

The object of this paper is to discuss the following three particular cases in the
light of what has been said in the foregoing pages.

(1) A cylinder subjected to a uniform tension T.
(2) A rectangular plate bent into the form of a right cylindrical surface.
(3) Torsion of a right circular cylinder. Virtually, Sarnt-VENANT’s semi-inverse method has been used in all the three cases. Frequent applications have also been made of his “ principle of the elastic equivalence
of statically equipollent systems of load.”

7—Comparison with experimental results

Various authors have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced
in a wire is not always proportional to the stretching force even when we remain

within the limits of perfect elasticity. GrrstNer* assumed an empirical relation
of the form

T= As + Bs? + Cs + Dst + ..., JURE SRLS STS)

T being the tension and 5 the total stretch. His experiments led him to the
conclusion that C, D, etc., are all zero, and that B is negative.
