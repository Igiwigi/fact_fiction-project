3. Proof of threshold theorem

From equations (2.6) and (2.7), the time evolution of the expectation of the state is described as

ig Ello) = (Aw -5 0) ELI6())], (3.1)
k


where we used E[dW;(t)] =0 in the Ito process. Then, using the fact that |y(T)) is the solution of
equation (2.1), we find

olti2)10 Nasi M ELI g(T))] = (D)). (3.2)

We describe the state in one realized time trajectory of equation (2.6) as |;(t)) and expand it at the
final time T as

\;(T)) = > Cinln). (3.3)

From equation (3.2), we immediately find
