and upon assuming ¢ = 0.5, equation (4.4) reduces to

for hold time in seconds. The parameter ¢ is the only ‘free’ parameter in the model and is a
relatively unimportant one, for if reduced to zero (no relaxation) or increased to unity (complete
relaxation) the computed coefficient differs only by about 10%.

Equation (4.5) is shown as the dashed curve in figure 5, for a sliding velocity of V;=10-5
ms~!. For hold time ty < 1000s, the model captures the experimental measurements reasonably
well. It is consistent, also, with the observation that sea water at the interface has either little
or no detectable effect, for there is no evidence that ice creeps more rapidly when wet. (In fact,
