In particular, many molecules can enjoy a seemingly stable existence in either a =
left- or a right-handed form which are distinct mirror images of each other, as was established by : a
the pioneering works of Pasteur [11], van â€™t Hoff [12] and Le Bel [13]. These opposite enantiomers : 2
often interact rather differently with living things, as chirality is also inherent to life: amino acids, DS
sugars and other biomolecules besides are chiral and their chirality is crucial to their biological ih
function [14]. To give but one of many striking examples, one enantiomer of methamphetamine : 4
is recognized as being a harmful narcotic, whereas the other enantiomer is relatively harmless, : be
being employed, in fact, as a decongestant. The two enantiomers of a simple chiral molecule are 72
depicted in figure 1. 16

One of the principal means by which we are able to probe and harness molecular chirality
is through the use of light that is itself chiral. Circularly polarized light in particular, which
was discovered by Fresnel, is a truly chiral influence [2,15].
