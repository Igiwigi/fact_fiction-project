The normal aleohols appear to give a constant value for GH,. which is decidedly

m numbers for isomeric oleoliols is enormous when compared with that given by the

Il the above facts point to the molecular complexity of the hydroxy liquids
lich: we have examined, and also to the conelusion that if complexity, as dis-
Mguished from the purely cliemical constitution of simple molecules, is the sole
sa of the irregularities, it exerts a mueh more profound effect in the ease of the
ole than fu any of the other liquids. This lust conclusion is farther sopported

ft will be remembered that, on passing from one slope to another, the viscosity
nitudes of water and the acids alter to the same extent as those of the
liquids. The alcohols, however, do not follow the same rule, for, as
