macroscopically through impedance boundary conditions. This leads to the definition of a surface
impedance tensor, which links the average tangential electric field to the average tangential
magnetic field (electric currents). This boundary condition supports the propagation of surface
waves (SWs). When the shape of the elements is regular enough (figure 1a), the impedance tensor
becomes a scalar and therefore the average effect of the boundary conditions is isotropic with
respect to the direction of propagation of the SW. When the element shape contains additional
features, like slots, grooves or cuts, the effect is anisotropic and the anisotropy can be easily
controlled for elements with two orthogonal symmetry axes (figure 1b).

In [1] and in many recent papers ([2,3] and references therein), emphasis is given to the
effect of reflection/transmission and only in minor part to SW propagation and local impedance
modulation, which is instead the main focus of this article. In particular, here it is shown how a
proper impedance modulation allows one to address SWs along desired curvilinear paths. In fact,
the impedance modulation, obtained by locally changing the sizes of the patches, imposes a local
modification of the dispersion equation and hence, at constant operating frequency, of the local
wavevector. The general effects of MTS modulation may be therefore treated in the framework of
transformation optics (TO) [4,5]. TO establishes a rigorous analytical rule for obtaining a control
on wave propagation within inhomogeneous anisotropic metamaterials. This control is achieved


by designing the equivalent macroscopic constitutive tensors of the metamaterial on the basis of 3 |
the differential parameters of a spatial coordinate transformation. The most famous use of TO

is concerned with invisibility cloaks [6,7]. However, the technological difficulties in controlling
the constitutive parameters in a volume complicate the engineering implementation of TO in
