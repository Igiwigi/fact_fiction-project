removes about 10-® cm, is in agreement with such a hypothesis, for modern work has
confirmed Brrtpy’s view that cracks are flowed over by a surface layer during polishing.

To confirm this, other surfaces were used. In the first place mica, which is known
to have an unusually perfect cleavage surface, and to exhibit theoretical strength
when loaded so as not to stress the edges,t was tried. Smooth cleavage surfaces
were sputtered and heated to about 300° C. No lines of crystals were ever detected,
which agrees with our hypothesis. It seemed natural to try rock salt, which has
been so much used in researches on crystal structure. Fresh cleavage surfaces were
sputtered and heated, and a variety of markings obtained, but the whole film
became discoloured, probably due to the action of the chlorine ions on the metal
of the film, and it did not seem safe to draw any conclusions. The observations
were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety of faults which were

visible under the microscope, each of which causes a local disturbance in the heated
film.

A critical test case was furnished by the natural faces of diamond crystals.
Rosertson, Fox, and Martn,§ in their comprehensive study of the physical pro-
perties of diamonds, have clearly established the existence of two types. Crystals
of what they call type 1 have usually perfect faces and are birefringent, while crystals
of type 2 are largely isotropic. As a result of a large number of experiments they
concluded that diamonds of type 1 are under strain, while in those of type 2 the
strain has been released by slipping, on one or more systems of planes, occurring at
some period in the formation, probably when the diamond was crystallizing from the
