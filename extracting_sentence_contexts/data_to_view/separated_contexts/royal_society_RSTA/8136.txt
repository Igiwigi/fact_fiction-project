This is the method of Uns√©ip. But it does not follow from this that N
will be independent of v, for the observed shape may not agree exactly with the theoretical
,. In fact until we know how deep to place the photospheric surface there is con-
siderable uncertainty as to what we mean by N. It may be different for different parts
of the line-contour. We require a fusion of the Scuusrer and ScawarzscuiLp models.
