including the muscles and ligaments of the vertebral column. Thus in the upper

limb, as in the lower, the sensory ray when its nerves are examined by experimental
degeneration, is proved to extend from the apex of the limb to the median plane of
the hody, in fact, to be a complete ray. The proximal part of the ray, however, just
as in the pelvic limb, nowhere reaches the body surface, but lies beneath the surface,
and is composed of muscles and deep tissues. If judged by skin alone it is wanting.

It becomes clear that absence of cutaneous branches from the dorsal primary divi-
sions of the VIIth, VII[th cervical, and Ist thoracic, and from the Vth, VIth and
VIIth post-thoracic nerves proves to be simply a natural concomitant of their
segmental position in the spinal series, and is a criterion indicating that they lie at
the very centre of the limb regions, respectively brachial and pelvic.

IV. The spinal roots which are the source of the afferent nerve-fibres of the ham-
string muscles can be determined by use of vaso-motor and of respiratory reflexes.
The individual dorsal (posterior) roots through which the afferent nerve-fibres from a
