meta-theorem in the theory of differential inclusions [18-20] is that, up to technical conditions,
for existence theorems of (2.4) the relaxation K’ introduced in connection with (2.2) and (2.3) can
be used as a replacement for the convex hull. However, there is an important technical caveat:
the set K’ has to be sufficiently large in a topological sense. A sufficient condition is that K’ c R4
has nonempty interior, but a key point in Tartar’s framework is that certain (linear or nonlinear)
constraints may restrict K’ to a lower-dimensional variety—a concrete example will be presented
below in the context of MHD turbulence.

Combining the general framework of Tartar in (2.2) and (2.3) with techniques developed for
the existence theory of vectorial differential inclusions (2.4) leads to the following basic principle
(again formulated in an imprecise way, ignoring technical side conditions):

PRINCIPLE II: Typical elements of S are in fact elements of S.

Here again ‘typical’ refers to Baire category. As such, using this principle to prove the existence
of solutions invariably leads to weak solutions with often paradoxical properties which are
highly irregular. In this sense, this principle is closely related to the construction of Weierstrass’
famous example of continuous but nowhere differentiable functions, which can be achieved
either by a direct construction of its slowly decaying Fourier series, or by using Baire category.
It turns out that both techniques have an appropriate analogy for the general case arising in (2.2)
and (2.3)—the former is often referred to as convex integration [20], the latter has been treated
in [18,19].

In the past decade, the two principles formulated above have led to a new paradigm in fluid
mechanics, with the appearance of a number of counterintuitive statements such as the existence
