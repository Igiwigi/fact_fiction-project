268 Sir H. Davy on the Substances produced

the phenomena can at present be given without involving sup-
positions.

It is not easy to devise simple experiments to ascertain
which of these hypotheses is true, yet, in admitting strict ana-
logical reasoning, it is easy to shew which is most conformable
to the general series of chemical facts.

Those acids which are known by direct experiments of de-
composition by heat, to consist of oxygen, bases, and water,
such as the strongest sulphuric and nitric acids and hydro-
phosphorous acid, when they are acted on by ammonia, afford
moisture: this is easily proved, by causing them to absorb
ammoniacal gas in glass retorts, and gently heating the mix-
ture, when water immediately appears. On this view, it oc-
curred to me, if the liquid fluoric acid was a compound of
water, and inflammable bases, and oxygen, that water ought
to be produced when it was made to combine with ammonia.
It was not possible to make the experiment in glass vessels,
