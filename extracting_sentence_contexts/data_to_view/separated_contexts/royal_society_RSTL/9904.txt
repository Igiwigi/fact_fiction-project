The ammonia
precipitate (5) 8ometimes gave the citron baud with great strength and purity, and
although I had not yet obtained this in quantities sufficient for a detailed examination,
it was easy to decide that it contained no phosphorie, silicic, or boric acid, fluorine, or
other body likely to cause the precipitation of lime in this group. This precipitate
musb therefore be an earth, and the more carefully I purified it from lime and other
substances, the more brilliantly shone out the ecitron band, and the more intense
became the green and red bands. Another stubborn fact was this :—Starting with a lime compound which showel
the citron band, I could always obtain a calcic oxalate which gave the band stronger
than the original substance ; but if I started with a lime compound which originally
gave no citron band, I could never by any means, chemical or physical, constrain the
lime or the earthy precipitate to yield a citron band.

12. Among the minerals tried was eudialyte, a silicate of zirconium, iron, calcium,
and sodium, containing about 10 per cent, of lime. No citron band could be detected
on testing the original mineral or any of the constituents separated from it on analysis.
