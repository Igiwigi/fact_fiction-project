orange pigment is distributed on the border line between the two zones, and in the
Malay Bear the peripheral pigment extends into the green in the form of light
purple patches. The discs are all round and more or less cupped. The pupils are
round in all except Ursus americanus, in which it is vertically oval, dilating to a full
circle. The Bears have a Membrana nictitans which only comes forward when they
are sleepy. Ursinus malursus rolls its eyes constantly backwards and outwards with
an extremely rapid movement every few seconds, withdrawing them at the same time
into the sockets in the same way as the Rhinoceros does. This movement enables
the animal to sweep the horizon without moving its head.

In examining the Ungulates, I was greatly struck by the fact that, according to
the Fundus oculi, they can be classed into two large divisions. The Artiodactyla,
which form the first section, have numerous large retinal vessels, whilst the other
Ungulata have either a few fine vessels restricted to the vicinity of the disc, or a
fundus devoid of all trace of retinal vessels.

The pupil is horizontally oval, except in the Elephant, Tapir, and Rhinoceros, where

it is circular. The iris is hardly sensitive to mydriaties, but contracts well to strong
light. Asa rule the iris shows two distinct layers, a number of Ungulates having
