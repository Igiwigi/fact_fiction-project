452 DR. PETTIGREW ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FIBRES

IV. The fibres composing the external and the internal layers are found at different
depths from the surface, and from the fact of their pursuing opposite courses cross each
other,—the fibres of the first external and last internal layers crossing with a slight
deviation from the vertical, as in the letter X.; the succeeding external and internal
layers, until the fourth or central layer, which is transverse, is reached, crosing at
guccessively wider angles, as may be represented by an þ4 placed horizontally :—

V. The fibres composing corresponding external and internal layers, such as layers
one and seven, two and six, &c., are continuous in the left yentricle at the left apex, and
in the right yentricle in the track for the anterior coronary artery, the fibres of bot
