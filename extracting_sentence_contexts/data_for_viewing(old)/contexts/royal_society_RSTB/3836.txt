in many places with calcific deposit which appears to take place regularly along their
constituent fibres. .

The indications that the honeycomb does not become calcified and that its function
is more that of a directing membrane.

The delayed and imperfect calcification at the enamel-dentine junction; the
existence of large tubes of the newly formed dentine which reach this junction line, and
the slight resistance to the penetration of the fibril which would be here presented.

The evidence that the expansions around the tubes are due to final closing up of
the calcification around areas of the enamel matrix in this situation, which remain
unealcified ; supported by the fact that no cireumscribed spaces such as exist in adult
marsupial enamel are seen in this position in developing teeth.

The effects of rapid decalcification, the tubes being left-in perfect continuity with
the dentine and retaining their position in the matrix from which all the lime salts
have been removed, ;

A comparison of human, partially tubular, enamel with the enamel of Phalanger
orientalis, in which the tube system is greatly reduced.

These evidences lead me to conclude that the essential difference between marsupial
and higher mammalian enamel lies in the imperfect calcification of the cement substance
in the former; that this imperfect calcification allows the penetration of the dentinal
