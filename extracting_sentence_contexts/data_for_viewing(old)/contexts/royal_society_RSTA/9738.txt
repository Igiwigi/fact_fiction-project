that of the solvent A., the solid solution is restricted to a few atomic per cent., but,
where the “size factor ” is favourable a considerable solid solution is usually formed,
and the solubility limits generally obey clear valency rules.

(3) Where solvent and solute are in the same period (e.g., silver, cadmium, indium . . .)
the atomic compositions of alloys of a given freezing point vary inversely as the
valency of the solute as far as Group V, whilst the compositions of alloys of a given
melting (solidus) point are approximately inversely proportional to the square of the
valency of the solute as far as Group TV. Both these laws apply to ternary alloys.

(4) When solvent and solute are in different periods the initial depression of freezing
point is usually greater than that to be expected from the normal valency effect. But
many of the solute atoms act as though they possessed a fictitious valency which is a
whole number, and to which the name “ liquidus factor” is given. It is shown that
these same liquidus factors apply to many ternary alloys, and methods are given for
the accurate calculation of liquidus points in ternary and quaternary alloys where the
binary curves are known.

(5) Where the size factor is favourable the maximum solid solubility is determined
mainly by the concentration of valency electrons, and this principle is shown to permit
the approximate calculation of the solubility limits in certain ternary alloys.

* Liquidus determinations were also made.
