for the two cases of plane and axial symmetry respectively. The coefficients $,, are non-
dimensional functions of ¢ only.

The normal procedure would be to substitute (8) [or (9)] and (10) in (3) and (4) and
attempt to manipulate all the trigonometric functions so that the only trigonometric functions
finally appearing are those of the orthogonal sets which are being used as the bases, namely,
cos 2nf or P,,(cos@). By collecting together all the terms in each particular cos 2n0 or
P,,,(cos@), the equations (3) and (4) yield three infinities of equations. These equations
would, in principle, be solved successively, beginning with the gravest harmonic and
moving to each higher harmonic in turn. Ifsuch a procedure were in fact possible, we would
hope to have established a convergent process, and to obtain a reasonable approximation
to the motion with the first few terms. Unfortunately, however, this procedure is too
complicated to give satisfactory results. The high powers of R which appear in the
velocity potentials give rise to very high order equations in the S$ coefficients, when
the expansions (8) or (9) are used in (3) and (4). An alternative procedure was therefore
developed.

In numerical work, of course, one can only take a few terms in the expansion. Any /inite
number of terms in the expansion (10) imposes the result that
