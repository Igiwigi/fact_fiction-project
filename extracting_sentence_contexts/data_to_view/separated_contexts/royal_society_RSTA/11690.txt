It will be noticed that the above tables indicate two things: firstly, that on the
whole the melting-point is lower when the sulphur is raised to it suddenly ; and
secondly, that all the melting-points are considerably above those given by Bropte. The reason probably is to be found either in the fact that Bropin used imperfectly

purified sulphur, or that there is a constant evror in our thermometers, which we have
no reason to believe. The fact probably is that Bropre did not sufficiently purify
his crystals from the evil-smelling compounds which they carry with them from the
bisulphide. Monoclinic Sulphur.—The melting-point of perfectly soluble monoclinic sulphur
was taken by the same observer in connection with a film which had been experi-
mented upon. Tasre [IT.—Melting-point of a Monoclinic Sulphur.*

= This agrees as well as can be expected with the observations of other observers on
Fhonectne sulphur, The fact that the melting-point of monoclinic sulphur, even when
‘at has lost its crystallographic properties, is about 120°, may be taken as established
By these observations.
