As expected, the DMBE/ES/SS-(2 + 3) PES provides a realistic representation of the potential
both in the valence and long-range interaction regions. In fact, as figures 16a and 17a show,
the current DMBE has the correct asymptotic behaviour, which is a well-established asset of
MBE theory [119,123-125]. It should be stressed that although the truncated potentials give a
good representation of the triplet linear global minimum, 1-C4C Xe ) is predicted to be a saddle
point of index 4, with imaginary frequencies corresponding to the degenerate trans-(w4) and
cis-bending (ws) modes. This result stems largely from the lack of the four-body term which,
according to figure 15a and the DMBE/ES/SS-(2 + 3) PES, is estimated to be as repulsive as
376k} mol™! at this geometry.
