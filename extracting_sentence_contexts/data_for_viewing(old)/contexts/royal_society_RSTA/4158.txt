model of equation (3.8). For tp < 751s, the fittings with a single Gaussian (L = 1) yield accurate
results whereas for longer evolution times two Gaussians (L = 2) are necessary to achieve similar
quality. This is illustrated in figure 4a, which shows the experimental points for the MQC
distribution at tp = 2001s together with the fittings using L =2. Fittings with L=1 and L=2
are displayed in figure 4b (data corresponding to tp = 2001s), for the sake of comparison. The
fact that a single Gaussian is insufficient to represent the MQC for all the orders becomes
evident.

Returning to figure 4a, the two-Gaussian fitting yields a good agreement with the experimental
data for all coherence orders n 4 0. As discussed above, So(tp) carries information not only on the
ZQC intensities resulting from correlated spins, but also polarization attributable to spins that
become decorrelated by decoherence and various non-idealities. Consequently, the experimental
data of ZQCs were excluded from the fittings at long evolution times. The fact that S,.¢(tp) decays,
indicates that not all the decorrelated spins are detected and therefore the contribution to ZQC is
partial. In order to evaluate the actual effectiveness of the time reversal procedure, we define the
zero-order difference (ZOD) as the distance between the experimental value and the fitted curve
evaluated in 1 = 0, Vtg. The LE incorporating the new definition is

Mme(tr) = Sie(tr) — ZOD(tp). (4.1)


This new definition of the LE is used to re-normalize the MQC curves, i.e. Sn(tp)/Mme(tr).
The results are presented in figure 3c. For short times, there is no differences with S,,(tp)/SLE(tE)
behaviour, because ZOD is not large enough to produce a remarkable effect in the experimental
results. Important differences can be observed for long evolution times, where the re-normalized
