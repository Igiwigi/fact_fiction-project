and similarly for dy and dz.
If w is any function of « and 8, it follows from (40) that

J (% 9) -J % #) +5 (% 2) JS (ee) +I (% 4) -J(,~) =0 ~~ (Al)

This compact relation is most inclusive, and with its aid the majority of transforma-
tions of partial first derivatives can be effected simply and quickly. It will be
observed that the important relation, (4), follows at once by rearrangement ;
putting z=, and w = 8, (41) reduces to (2) or (3) ; in fact, by simple substitu-
tions and rearrangements, relations (1) to (32) may all be deduced progressively
from (41).

It is obvious that by means of this equation, we may express any one J (7, 5) in
terms of five others, provided that each variable is completely determined by any
chosen two which are independent. If« and @ are chosen from among the variables
included in the expression (41), we find, since J («, 8) = 1, that any one J (7, s) may
be expressed in terms of four others ; this is equivalent to saying that any one ratio
of two Jacobians in (41) (and thus any partial first derivative) is expressible in terms
of four others.

If any other relation is known and « and § are specified, then only three
