its changes owing to the stochastic scheme. While in STOCH_UNCPL, sea ice velocities are
slightly decreased in the central Arctic (anticlockwise arrows), they are increased in STOCH_CPL
(clockwise arrows). The differences between the simulations can be explained as follows: during
the transient phase of the integration, STOCH_UNCPL experiences a slight increase in sea ice
velocities (not shown). The increased sea ice thickness distribution is still accumulating and
increased sea ice thicknesses do not yet balance the influence from the effective weakening of
the sea ice strength owing to the stochastic perturbations. After this transient phase, though, sea
ice drift tends to be reduced, because thicker sea ice is capable of balancing the direct impact of
the P* perturbations.

The velocity changes in STOCH_CPL are quite different. Most of the drift in the central
Arctic is increased or slightly redirected towards the north coasts of Canada, the Canadian Arctic
Archipelago and Greenland. Due to the fact that there is no accumulation in Arctic sea ice, the
