it will be shown in the Appendix that D’ and the boundary-equations must be linear ;
and the body- and boundary-equations must be the condition that a certain positive
homogeneous quadratic function V of yh, Yo, ..., W, is a complete minimum. Also
f, though otherwise arbitrary, is limited on the boundary to be the difference of two
functions of position both of which satisfy the said boundary-conditions. Under

deferred to the Appendix. The (P)’s may be called the principal or normal modes
of vibration of the system. Vis analogous to potential energy. Some of the

commoner possible forms of D’ will be found in the table on p. 354. As well as the
equation Dp = 0, the equation ©’ = (a given function of the co-ordinates), and
the equation (D’—)’)d=0 may be treated by these successive-approximation-
