In this connexion an observation of Joyer occurred to
me, which I state from memory. He noticed in a vigorous fish that his chronograph,
which was connected with the end surfaces of the organ columns of a brainless
Torpedo, gave, in response to a single excitation of electrical nerves, a wavy
fluctuating movement. This he attributed to the fact that, owing to the slow rate of
transmission in the electrical nerves of the Torpedo, the excitatory change was
probably initiated at different times in different parts of the organ mass. I had
myself observed a still more remarkable instance of the same phenomenon. In making a nerve organ preparation from a vigorous Torpedo, the brain of which
had been destroyed, I held a small mass of cut-out organ grasped between the fingers
