Three among them which,
2 when first examined, were found to undergo decomposition after exposure for a few
S minutes to 100*C., were elected for re-examination, and they all perfectly resisted
AQ decomposition upon long-continued exposure to that temperature. It thus appears definitely established that the stability of gun-cotton is importantly
increased by long-continued exposure to diffused daylight. An examination into the
cause of this interesting fact is now being prosecuted, and the results promise import-
antly to strengthen the confidence which is already placed in the permanence of gun-
cotton.â€”June 1867. MDCCCLXVII, 2x
