The understanding of the carrier hopping through these crystalline and amorphous regions
in semiconductor polymers has attracted a lot of interest in the organic electronic community
[13,15,16]. Seminal papers on this matter have been reported, and had changed the paradigm
that better crystallinity leads to better solar cell efficiency [14,16]. In fact, the knowledge of the
energetic disorder in the organic material and its relation with the carrier transport and carrier
recombination is a key factor for improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs that
are equipped with polymers and other organic semiconductor molecules as selective contacts. We have previously studied the performance of PSCs using different PSHT molecular weights
(MWs) [8]. Direct relationships between the MWs of polymers and their solar cell performances
have been investigated [3].
