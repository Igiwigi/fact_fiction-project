cyst will continue to act rhythmically in water which is stale enough to cause the less
potent lithocysts to act irregularly, or not to act at all.

Other forms of mutilation—such as cutting off the polypite or portion of the 8wim-
ming-bell—causes, first acceleration of the rhythm, and then a progressive decline to a
certain point below the original rate. The rate then remains stationary at this point,
but may again be made temporarily to rise and permanently to fall by removing another
portion of the swimming-bell. In these experiments the rhythm, besides becoming
permanently slowed, is also often rendered permanently irregular. Again, paring down
the contractile tisxues from around a single lithocyst has the effect, when the tissue is
greatly reduced, of giving rise to enormously long periods of inactivity. During s8uch
a period, however, stimulation may initiate a bout of rhythmical contractions, to be fol-
lowed by another prolonged pause. These facts tend to show that the apparently
automatic action of the lithocysts is really due to a constant stimulation supplied by
other parts of the organism.

Temperature exerts a profound influence on the rate of the rhythm. This influence
may be best obseryed within moderate limits of variation; for water below 20* suspends
spontaneity and even irritability, while water above 70* permanently slows the rhythm
