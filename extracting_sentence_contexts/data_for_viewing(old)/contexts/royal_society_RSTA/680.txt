should behave like a rough wall, and increase the overall drag [23]. Surprisingly, Hokmabad et al.
found that the non-wetted NeverWet surface did show a decrease in Reynolds shear stress for
20 <y* < 80 (figure 7e). This would indicate drag reduction, and would mechanistically agree
with the computational work of Min & Kim [48], Martell et al. [52] and Busse & Sandham [54].

We also recently evaluated the NeverWet coating in a fully developed turbulent channel
flow (figure 7f [57]). Turbulent drag reduction has not been reported above a height-based
Reynolds number of 10000, and we also found no discernible difference in skin friction between
a NeverWet-coated sample and a smooth base plate. In fact, at the higher Reynolds numbers
tested, a slight increase in friction was observed, indicating a transitionally rough surface. Our
lack of observed drag reduction matches that of SH-2 measured by Aljallis et al. [40], whose
measurements of the NeverWet coating also matched the friction coefficient of an uncoated
baseline sample at higher Reynolds numbers.

The resulting drag reduction of the four independent studies on NeverWet are presented as a
function of Re, in figure 7g. At low-friction Reynolds number, NeverWet has produced a 10-30%
reduction in drag. However, the drag reduction always disappeared at higher friction Reynolds
numbers, although the cut-off in Rer would appear to be dependent on the flow facility. The most
likely reasons for this discrepancy are the differing pressures in each test set-up, how quickly the
pressure exceeds the capillary resistance of the NeverWet coating, as well as the viscous length
scale of the flow.
