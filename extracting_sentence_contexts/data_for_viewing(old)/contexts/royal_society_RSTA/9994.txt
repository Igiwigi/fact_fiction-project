Table XTX. is principally intended to bring out two facts: (1) that the hour of
most frequent occurrence of the daily maximum is earlier in years of sunspot
minimum than in years of maximum ; (2) that the distribution of maxima is more
concentrated, 7.e. less uniform throughout the 24 hours, in years of sunspot minimum
than in years of maximum. The phenomenon first mentioned is most conspicuous in
winter. As regards the second phenomenon, there is an apparent exception in
winter, the occurrences between midnight and 10 a.m, then diminishing slightly with
increased sunspot frequency. This diminution is, however, more than made up for
by the increase in the occurrences between 4 p.m. and midnight, and it probably
merely represents the tendency to a closer approach to equality between the morning
and evening occurrences which is seen in sunspot maximum years at the other
seasons,
