we use in many areas of physics to separate processes on different time scales is
clearly much more problematic in the biological realm where the integration and
mutual interaction among the various processes often play an essential role. A third contribution to the complexity that we observe in living systems derives
from the fact that such systems operate at far-from-equilibrium conditions. This
is, perhaps, most clearly demonstrated through the significant differences in the
concentrations of different ions that the cells maintain across their plasma
membranes. These differences allow the cells to produce the often complicated
electrophysiological signals they need to regulate their internal processes and

o communicate with neighbouring cells.
