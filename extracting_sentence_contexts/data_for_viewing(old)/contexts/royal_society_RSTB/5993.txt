By the time that the crushed food mass reaches the sixteenth trunk limb, I believe
it is sufficiently triturated to be passed forwards. If a large particle did pass forwards,
that is, if the posterior limbs could not masticate it, I imagine, that it could be removed
by the caudal furca.

The food mass is now transferred forwards by the more anterior gnathobases. This
is carried out by the brush sete aided by the currents from the inter-limb spaces which
commence in this region.

The claw processes of the anterior gnathobases must also assist in pushing forwards
the food mass but I believe that this function diminishes as the food passes forwards.
In fact, I do not believe that the main function of the claw process is gnathobasic.
If it were so, it is difficult to see why it has lost the claw armature which is so conspicuous
in the hinder limbs, for its terminal claws, in fact, the only claws it retains, progressively
diminish in actual size in the anterior limbs although the gnathobase itself becomes
considerably larger.

The function of the claw process is, I believe, to assist in directing forwards the spurts
of water leaving the inter-limb spaces. The exit channels from these spaces are covered
on their median side by the gnathobase and water is forced from the inter-limb space
when the limb is at the end of its backstroke. In this position the gnathobase with
its claw process will just cover the whole of the length of the exit groove. The shape of
the exit groove itself directs the water forwards but the presence of the covering
gnathobase prevents the water passing medially, and at the same time, converts the
