‘ehameteristic of all the Siluridte normales, and as equally conspicuous by its absence
jw all other Ostariophyse, may possibly have some physiological signiticance. Baoewwan (loc ott.) has already referred to this feature in certain Siluroids, and
ts that, physiologically, itenables certain advantages to be realized, which, in
other Ostoriopliysern, are gained by the bipartite structure of the air-bladder. In
relvering to the two-chambered air-bladders of the Cyprinids, Characinides, and the
Gymuotidis, he directs attention to the fact that this subdivision of the air-bladder
heoura in no other Teleostei, and is always associated with the presence of a Weberian
qecbunism. ‘The variable ratios of pressure of the surrounding medium condition
Alc increase or decrease of the volume of gas contained in the whole air-bladder, and,
fying to the peculiar structure of that organ, these variations of volume will tind
Beir expression almost exclusively im corresponding oscillations in volume of the
stall clastic anterior chamber, to which alone the Weberian ossicles are related,
te larger posterior suc being scarcely, if at all, affected. A similar bipartition, the
@me writer also remarks, occurs only in afew Siluride, among which are mentioned,
epparently on the authority of Vanencrsnns, Auchanoglanis* and Auchenipterus.
