melongena Linné, Recent; original designation and monotypy.

Osteodes Paetel, 1887 (Cat. Conch. 4th ed. 1, 35) non Conrad, 1855 (Moll.) nec Guenée,
1857 (Lepid.) (=Galeodes Bolten).

Subgenus PUGILINA Schumacher, 1817
(Ess. Vers test. pp. 65, 216)

Type species. Pugilina morio (Linné), Recent=P. fasciata Schumacher; Sacco, 1904.

Remarks. Gray (B1847) designated Murex morio Linné as the type species of Pugilina P
Schumacher, and Murex pyrum Linné as the type species of Pugilina « Schumacher. Apart
from the fact that the latter species is not mentioned by Schumacher, the designation of
two type species under the name Pugilina invalidates both; that of Sacco is therefore
adopted.
