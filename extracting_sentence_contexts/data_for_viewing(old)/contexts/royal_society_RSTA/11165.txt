the differentiation of the two constituents by differences of level being here entirely
due to strain, It will be observed that the scale of this structure is similar to that
of the slip-bands seen in pure metals, and examination of strained specimens shows
that plastic yielding is associated with slips occurring between layers of the two con-
stituents. A close examination of strained specimens has enabled us to detect
slip-bands in the light-coloured constituent. By adopting the device of slow cooling,
which has led to such excellent results in the hands of Messrs. Heycock and NEVILLE,
we have succeeded in producing specimens of eutectics in which the characteristic
structure is developed upon a much larger scale. Fig. 49 exemplifies this in the
eutectic of bismuth and lead, and shows slips which occur in the white constituent as
a consequence of straining. This photograph illustrates a feature very characteristic
of eutectic alloys ; a parallel system of slip-bands extends over many patches of the
white constituent, thus pointing to the fact that the crystalline elements are similarly
oriented throughout considerable areas of at least one of the two constituents of the
alloy. This suggests that the alloy as a whole has comparatively coarse granular
structure, and the same conclusion is borne out by observing the general character of

a surface under lower magnifications (such as 100 diameters), when its structure is

revealed either by straining or etching. The surface is then seen to be divided into

rather large more or less polygonal areas, each covered with a system of ribs radiating
