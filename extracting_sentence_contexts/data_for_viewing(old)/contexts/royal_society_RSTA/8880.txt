In addition to the illuminator, I had the use of a large selection of colour filters kindly
lent by Messrs. Hilger. Unfortunately, those which might have been useful cut down
the working radiation too much. For monochromatism the dispersion of the illumi-
nator has therefore alone been relied on. As a matter of fact, the lines were all sharp
and widely separated, and no trouble has been experienced, owing either to overlapping
or to stray light of other wave-lengths. The lamp was run at the maximum brightness
at which it could be depended on to run smoothly and remain constant. To prevent
trouble due to stray light it was necessary to enclose the lamp in a large tin box, and
to prevent over-heating a water-cooling system had to be provided. Once the apparatus
was adjusted the successive lines could be rapidly thrown on the drops simply by
adjusting the screw setting of the illuminator. In every case the satisfactoriness of the
mechanical setting was confirmed by visual observation.

Very steady conditions have been obtained with these arrangements. The data for
two determinations of the characteristic curves with this apparatus are shown in fig. 12.
One of these, x , was taken the same day as and immediately preceding the determina-
