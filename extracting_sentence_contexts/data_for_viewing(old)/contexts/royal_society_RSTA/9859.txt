any difference of pressure between their gaseous contents unless some force acts
tangentially on the gas in the connecting pipe, as, for example, when one vessel is
above the other and gravity alters the pressure. Much more so, therefore, with the
atmosphere. Suppose a certain pressure at a point A and a lower pressure at a point
C, and to exclude gravity let A and C be on the same level. If this difference of
pressure is to be maintained a sufficient force must act along every possible line of
communication between C and A, that is to say, along every line that can be drawn
from A to C without passing through the earth or leaving the upper limit of the
atmosphere. Failing this force the pressures at A and C will be equalised in some-
what the same time that it will take for sound to travel along the unopposed line of
communication between A and ©. At all events, the velocity should be of the same
order as that of sound. This statement hardly seems to me to require proof, but if it
does the following facts may be quoted. The wave of pressure produced by the erup-
tion of Krakatoa passed round the earth with the velocity of sound. On the equator,
where there is no possibility of any opposing force, there are hardly any appreciable
differences of pressure, save those due to the semi-diurnal pressure wave which travels
with a velocity of about four-thirds of that of sound. The nature of the force that
acts between A and C in parts of the earth away from the equator was pointed out
by Ferrer. If C be the centre of a well-developed cyclone, it is largely supplied by
the centrifugal force of the curvilinear winds that blow round C, but in most cases it
is due to the tendency of a moving body to turn to the right hand (in the northern
hemisphere), which again is due to the earth’s rotation. (See a paper by Mr. Gotp,
“Barometric Gradient and Wind Force, M.O. 190.) Briefly, we may say that a
