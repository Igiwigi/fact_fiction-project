Proceeding analogously to the proof of property (P),
we obtain that any f,, with 0 <a < ap satisfies the Nagumo-type condition (f3), uniformly with
respect to @, in the sense that, corresponding to the R given in the statement of the theorem, the
constant Mr and the map ¢o do not depend on aw. Consequently, we have the following

Mr. This fact and assumption (Hr) imply that, given
QR ={UEE:?|Uloo <R, |U!loo < Mr},

we have that

(i) for every a € [0, a9] (3.5) has no T-periodic solution on 0p,
(ii) (3.7) has no T-periodic solution on Qp if a =a. Call now Ng : E > F the Nemitski operator associated to the nonlinear part of equation (3.5), that
is, No (u)(t) = f(t, u(t), u(t — t), u’(t)) + a(t). By properties (i) and (ii), we can apply the homotopy
invariance property of the coincidence degree, obtaining:

D,(L — N, 2p) = Di (L — No, 2p) = Di(L — Nag, 2p) = 0.
