SoeMMERRING, Cuvier, White, LAwRENCE, and VirEy. These points certainly distin-
guish many Negro tribes from the Europeans, but they are not common to all the
Negroes of the interior of Africa; the greater number of which are well made, and
have handsome features.

Some Remarks on the Intellectual Faculties of the Negro.

The brain is undoubtedly the organ of the mind. It is the part of our body which
gives us the consciousness of our own existence, and through which we receive the
impressions made upon the external senses, conducted to the brain by the nerves.
Here the perceptions are compared and combined s0 as to produce ideas. In this
organ we think, reason, desire, and will. In short, the brain is the instrument by
which all the operations called intellectual are carried on. It is proved by facts and
observations that animals partake of feelings, sensations, and intellectual faculties in
a higher degree, and approach more nearly to mankind in proportion as their brain
resem√æles more the human brain. An intimate connexion between the structure of
the brain and the intellectual faculties in the animal kingdom cannot be doubted.
As the facts which we have advanced plainly prove that there are no well-marked
and essential differences between the brain of the Negro and European, we must con-
clude that no innate difference in the intellectual faculties can be admitted to exist
between them. This has been denied by philosophers*, naturalists+, and tra-
vellers, who assert that the Ethiopian race is naturally inferior to the European
in intellectual and moral powers. The data upon which such an opinion is based
are either erroneous suppositions and false deductions from anatomy and physiology,
or superficial observations on the intellectual and moral faculties of the Negroes,
