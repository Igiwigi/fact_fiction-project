2, p. 359, 1900) for cathode rays produced by ultra-violet light, that in

3 a vacuum a very large change in the potential difference produces no change in the
— current. The curves of fig. 6, obtained with a platinum cathode in air, present no peculiar
3 features, being similar to those obtained with the zine cathode. The fact that the
electrodes in this case were only 2 millims. apart introduces slight modifications, the
sudden change in the curves which occurs when the mean free path of the ion and
the distance apart of the electrode become comparable, appearing at a higher pressure
than before when the electrodes were 3°5 centims. apart, as we should naturally
expect.
