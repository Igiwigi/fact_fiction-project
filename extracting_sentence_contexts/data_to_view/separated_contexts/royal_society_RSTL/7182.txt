690 DR. W. B. CARPENTER ON THE STRUCTURE, PHYSIOLOGY, AND

ova in the swollen portions of the pinnze has been scen not merely by Mr. J. V. Tnowys;
but by M. DuoarDIN, Professor MirLLEr, Dr. Buscn, Professor Wryvikue THoMs0xN,
myself. 'The fact is that these animals are unisexual; and that while oya are produced
in the conceptacles of some individuals, spermatozoa are developed within others, and
are set, free in the same mode. *

The statement of Mr. J. V. Twoxrs0w as to the identity of his Pentacrinus with the.
young of Comatula, on which doubts had been cast by M. DuJanpiN', was satisfactorily
confirmed by Professor ForBes. *© When dredging in Dublin Bay,” he s8ays (Introduction,
Pp. xii), *in Angust 1840, with my friends Mr. R. Bauu and W. Truomrsox, we found
numbers of the Phytocrinus or Polype-state of the Feather-star, more advanced than
they had ever been scen before, s0 advanced that we saw the creature drop from its stem
and swim about a true Comatula ; nor could we find any difference between it and the
perfect animal, when examining it under the microscope.”
