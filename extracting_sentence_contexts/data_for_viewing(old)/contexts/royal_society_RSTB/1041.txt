Pryer (2) from his experiments on the fore limb of the Rabbit, advanced the
statement that the skin overlying a muscle in the limb is supplied with sensory
nerve-fibres by the same spinal nerve which contributes motor fibres to the underlying
muscle. This conclusion was reaffirmed by W. Krause (4). It harmonises with
a “law” previously formulated by ScuRODER VAN DER Ko1x,* that the sensory
branches of a nerve that gives off motor branches always pass to that part of the

x & Joint which is moved by the muscles which the motor branches supply. V. DER
a Korx’s law had reference chiefly to the distribution of the nerve trunks of limb-
g plexuses, and was not, by v. per Korx, applied to the distribution of pure
§ spinal nerves. That in the trunk the skin overlying a muscle is supplied with
B sensation by the same spinal nerve as that supplying the motor innervation
Sto the muscle is no doubt generally the case. But a fact of greater constancy
§ is that between the anterior and posterior borders of the skin-field of a posterior root,
P the mid-point lies posterior to the mid-point of the muscular field of the anterior
sproot. The cutaneous field of the sensory root lies somewhat further back than
= does the muscular field of the motor root. And this obliquity of mutual
s relationship becomes greater as the trunk is followed backwards. The cutaneous
E field of the VIIth thoracic sensory root covers the whole of the 7th intercostal
‘8 space, and more or less of other intercostal spaces also. The skin- field of the Xth
8 thoracic root overlies a small portion only of the 10th intercostal space, but largely
@ the 11th space, and the 12th rib. The skin-field of the sensory root of the XIIth
= thoracic does not overlie its corresponding rib at all, but is altogether behind it.

€ of the thigh; the motor root of that nerve innervates muscles which at lowest
