states and destroy (decohere) non-local superpositions. Using a predictability sieve to implement
einselection [13,17,19,44] is a good way to appreciate this.

FAQ 4: Repeatability of measurements, axiom (iii), seems to be a very strong assumption. Can it be
relaxed (e.g. to include POVMs)?

Non-demolition measurements are very idealized (and hard to implement). In the interest
of brevity, we have imposed a literal reading of axiom (iii). This is very much in the spirit of
Dirac’s textbook, but it is also more restrictive than necessary [39], and does not cover situations
that arise most often in the context of laboratory measurements. All that is needed in practice
is that the record made in the apparatus (e.g. the position of its pointer) must be ‘repeatably
accessible’. Frequently, one does not care about repeated measurements of the quantum system
(which may even be destroyed in the measurement process). Axiom (iii) captures in fact the
whole idea of a record—it has to persist in spite of being read, copied, etc. So one can impose
the requirement of repeatability at the macroscopic level of an apparatus pointer with a much
better physical justification than Dirac did for the microscopic measured system. The proof of §3
then goes through essentially as before, but the details (and how far one can take the argument)
depend on specific settings. This ‘transfer of the responsibility for repeatability’ from the quantum
system to a (still quantum, but possibly macroscopic) apparatus allows one to incorporate non-
orthogonal measurement outcomes (such as POVMs) very naturally: the apparatus entangles
with the system and then acts as an ancilla in the usual projective measurement implementation
of POVMs (e.g. [32]).

FAQ 5: Probabilities—why do they enter? One may even say that, in the Everettian setting, ‘everything
happens’, so why are they needed and what do they refer to?
