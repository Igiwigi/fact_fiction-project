In a similar way, on increasing the pressure, keeping the temperature constant, it
was found that the leak at the higher pressure was too small at first and only
gradually rose to its final steady value.

It is evident from what has been said that the lag in the leak behind pressure

changes must have affected to some extent the results shown in fig. 3. The practically
exact coincidence of the two curves might merely imply that the observations were
taken at about the same rate in the two cases, so that the errors were about the same
in each case. A check on this was, of course, afforded by the fact that values of the
leak were only retained after they ceased to vary with the time ; but partly owing to
the great length of time required for equilibrium to be established, and partly owing
to the invariable presence of irregularities of another kind, which will be considered
later, it was very difficult to be sure that equilibrium had been attained in any
specified case. For this reason it was thought desirable to have some further means
of checking the extent to which these influences affected the measurements.

This was done by gradually increasing the oxygen pressure instead of diminishing
it, as happened by taking readings after successive strokes of the pump. It is
evident that under these conditions the pressure time lag will have the opposite
effect to what it had when the pressure was being reduced, so that the lack of
coincidence between the curves obtained with increasing and diminishing pressure
