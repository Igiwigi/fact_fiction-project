one as any that can be advanced.

That the explanation given is probably correct is seen on examination of the table
in fig, 47, for in the visuo-sensory area it is certain that many more fibres pass to the
cortex than is the case in the visuo-psychic region illustrated in the table in fig. 48.
It is at once evident by comparing the figures of the two tables that the thinning of
the layers at the bottoms of the fissures in the visuo-sensory cortex is relatively much
more marked than is the alteration in depth of the various layers of the apices and
flat surfaces; in other words, the bend at the bottom of the fissures is relatively
more abrupt in the visuo-sensory cortex than it is in the visuo-psychiec.

Whilst this matter is one of interest rather than importance, and may appear to be
self-evident, it has, however, been thought desirable to refer to it here, as the facts
are so clearly brought out by a study of the micrometer measurements introduced into
this section. If the facts be considered self-evident, the discussion has probably been
not without value as an illustration of the general accuracy of the measurements.

From the subject matter in this section the following conclusions may be drawnâ€”

(1) In the area of special lamination described in Section 4, in cases of old standing
optic atrophy, the line of Grnnart is decreased nearly 50 per cent. in
thickness, and the outer granule layer more than 10 per cent.

(2) In the visuo-psychie region surrounding the area of special lamination, old
standing optic atrophy causes no modification of the lamination.
