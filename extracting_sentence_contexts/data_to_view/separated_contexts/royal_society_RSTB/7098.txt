For present purposes, it is preferable
to call this two-stage sampling. In the present terminology sampling unit has a somewhat
generalized connotation. In multi-stage work there is, in fact, a hierarchy of sampling
units at successive stages. The units selected in the first stage of randomization may be
_ called sampling units of the first stage; within each such selected sampling unit smaller
= sampling units are selected by a second act of randomization, and these are sampling units
& of the second stage (these are called subsamples by Cochran); within each second-stage
8 sampling unit smaller sampling units are drawn at random by a third act of randomization,
& and so on. Present terminology is thus more general and more convenient for dealing
& with this type of sampling.
