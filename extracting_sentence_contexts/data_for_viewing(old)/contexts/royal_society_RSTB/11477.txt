(d) A possible solution

One solution to the problem of abstract meanings is to turn to
language [28,41â€”45]. On this view, the knowledge under-
lying abstract concepts comes from language itself.* What
does it mean for knowledge to come from language? It is
useful to distinguish between three ways that language can
impact semantic knowledge:

(i) Language as a source of propositions

Most uncontroversially, language is a source of various prop-
ositions. Among these are: (1) relatively specific facts, e.g. that
the mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska from 1997 to 2017, was a cat
named Stubbs, (2) facts that help guide action, e.g. that stick-
ing a fork in an electric outlet is a bad idea, and (3) more
abstract knowledge, e.g. that a year is 365 days, that an
even number is divisible exactly by two, and so on. No
one, we think, would disagree that a sizable amount of our
semantic knowledge is derived from such explicit uses of
language (e.g. [48] for discussion), though a precise amount
is difficult to quantify.

(ii) Language as a categorical cue
