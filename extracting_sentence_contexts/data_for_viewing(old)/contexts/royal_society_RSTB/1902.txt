~ In 1892 Srraspurcer published his well-known paper on the Pollen of Gymno-
Bperms (9), in which he showed that Betasurr’s account of the formation and
Spehaviour of the cells of the male gametophyte in Tawus held good in its main
Beatures for all the principal groups of Gymnosperms. In Pinus itself, the formation
gpf the two generative cells from the “body cell of the antheridium,” which takes
&place after pollination, was not actually seen, but from a study of the formation of
She male gametophyte in the pollen grain,and a comparison of the whole series of
‘Sevents in other genera, no reasonable doubt remained that the formation of the
‘two generative cells, which together with the “stalk cell” nucleus and the “pollen
Atube nucleus” were clearly figured lying at the apex of the pollen tube just above
the egg, conformed to the general type.

The fact of this formation was established in 1894 by Drxon (14) in Pinus
silvestris, Dixon, working in Srraspurcer’s laboratory, followed out the processes
occurring in the pollen tube and pollen grain after pollination. He was the first to
observe the passage of the two generative cells and of the two free nuclei into the
egg. But the actual process of fertilization he failed to follow. Drxon also made
some observations on the number of chromosomes in various cells of the oophyte, as

well as in various sporophytic tissues. I cannot confirm Drxoy’s work on this last
point. The matter is fully dealt with in the body of the paper.
