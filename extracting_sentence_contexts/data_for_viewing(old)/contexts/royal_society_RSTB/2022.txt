Band mealy as B, subtilis.
ES B. Megatherium is said by LeHMaNN and NevuMANN to coagulate milk with a
< feebly alkaline reaction; and B. subtilis and B. mesentericus similarly ; with the
Hexception that no obvious coagulum was observed, the present species behaves some-

& LeHMANN and NervuMANN also found that B. Megatherium, B. subtilis, and
3 B. mesentericus are all facultative anaérobes, again agreeing with the present species.
3 All colour by Gram’s method, and all agree in forming no gas in sugar solutions.
In view of these facts it seems clear that the form which is the subject of these
A notes bears resemblances to the group of common soil bacilli, B. Megatheriwm, and to
Bacillus granulosus, Russ., but its precise systematic position remains to be determined
by the future investigation of related species. The objection that Dr Bary described
his B. Megatheriumt as 2°5 » thick can be met by the reply that other observers have
found it very variable in diameter.
In order to avoid the inconvenience of referring to this form as a mere variety of
