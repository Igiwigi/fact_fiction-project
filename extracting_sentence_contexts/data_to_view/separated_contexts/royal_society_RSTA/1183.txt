Intrinsically disordered FACT proteins visualized by HS-AFM imaging. The mean squared point-to-point distance (r) 3!
of tail-like structures measured from movie frames (insert) as a function of the contour length (Lc) allows determination of the Dm
macroscopic persistence length (/,) using the appropriate chain polymer model (equation). The insert shows a movie frame Da
revealing a FACT protein with the contour length of the tail-like region schematically depicted. Adapted from [94]. 28

unfolding consists in grabbing a protein with the probe, pulling from it at constant velocity :8
and measuring the force required to unfold it. Early experiments by the group of Hermann :3
Gaub revealed that certain protein domains, such as the immunoglobulin-like (I) domains of â€˜Ss
titin formed by f sheets, unfolded in an abrupt manner in a reversible processes that was
described with just two states: the native, folded state and the unfolded state [21].
