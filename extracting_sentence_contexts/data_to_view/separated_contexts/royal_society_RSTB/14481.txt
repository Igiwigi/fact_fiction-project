And I argue that the presence/absence of
the visual experience of depth is exactly what marks the
distinction between the perception/cognition of depth. Contrast this with the alternative where pictures are just as
much 3D vision as stereo vision. Here you're missing the fact
that the separation between objects in depth is literally per-
ceived in one context (stereo vision) but not in the other
(pictures). Or, as I explain in [29], the fact that ‘while someone
viewing a car and a photograph of a car may be able to identify
the same object, they don’t literally perceive the same 3D
shape.’ By contrast, if you classify pictures as actual seeing
3D shape, then someone looking at a picture of a car just as
equally sees the 3D shape of the car as someone looking at
the car in real life. But that seems to miss exactly what's impor-
tant about 3D vision.
