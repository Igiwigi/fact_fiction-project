Numerical tests are necessary to verify the effectiveness of SMRT in the non-equilibrium regime. The main purpose of the present work is to give a coherent and detailed presentation of the
multi-relaxation model. In addition, using the fact that the irreducible components of a fully
symmetric tensor are its traceless components [17], the tensor decomposition beyond the second
rank is given. For the third moments, there are at most two relaxation times, of which one is
identified with the relaxation rate of the translational kinetic energy while the other has no explicit
hydrodynamic correspondence. For the fourth moments, there could be three independent
relaxation times, all of which have no hydrodynamic correspondence.
