Whether females prefer
certain nests and what role this plays in mating success is
unclear. Parental roles also vary post-construction and egg-
laying. Some species remain with offspring while others do


not, and for Hy. faber and others, male care at the nest is facul- that the evolution of foam nesting is in fact relatively simple,

tative [57,64]. As in other animals, predator defense is arising from behavioural (rhythmic beating/whipping
presumably enhanced when burrows are completely sealed motions) and physiological (ovarian secretions related to egg
and/or when parents remain with their offspring. A particu- jelly) ‘pre-adaptations’ [68].
