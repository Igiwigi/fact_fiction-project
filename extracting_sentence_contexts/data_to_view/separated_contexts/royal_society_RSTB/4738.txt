He states
that in the metanauplius of Cetochilus there are transverse plates of connective-tissue
cells that divide the body cavity more or less into compartments. These plates are
placed inter-segmentally, and from their position might be regarded as dissepiments. He points out, however, that their incompleteness and the fact that they are made up
of very few cells does not support this view. Among the Phyllopoda there is a paper in Russian by Nassonow (18), in which there
is a figure of a horizontal section of the nauplius of Artemia showing a paired series of
cavities in the posterior segments of the body, and which, according to Korscuetr and
Herper, are taken to represent a temporary development of paired ccelomic vesicles. In the nearly related genus Branchipus, Ciaus (6) did not find this state of affairs.
