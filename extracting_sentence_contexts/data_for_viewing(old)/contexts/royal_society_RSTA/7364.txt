In selecting the best value for the velocity gradient, there are two considerations of
primary importance. First, the gradient must be such that the cusp of the time-distance
curve calculated for this gradient must lie at a distance less than the minimum observed
distances for the multiple refractions after their reduction to zero order. Secondly, since
the more distant points are of less weight than the closer, the value of the gradient should
be such that the fit is better for the closer points. The weights of the points are different,
since the larger-range observations have all been obtained from the lower-order refrac-
tions, with the result that any fixed errors have, at these larger ranges, been divided by the
smaller integers.

The justification for assuming that there is no change in velocity at the interface between
the water and the sediments lies in the fact that if there were a change then the calculated
