fluid which united all the elements together (se fig. 3). That from the latter, namely,

the Fallopian tubes, was much the same as the preceding, excepting that the number
of the blood-discs was considerably less ; that there was a greater abundance of
ciliated epithelium ; and that the fluid in which the elements floated was not gela-
tinous, but serous (ee fig. 4).

A consideration of the facts thus presented to notice, led me to conclude that the
girl had died at the very onset of a catamenial period, for I could not discover any
evidence of the occurrence of an external flow; in fact, the secretion found in the
vagina was not very abundant, and it had acquired only a pale rose tint.

On instituting a further inquiry into the case, I ascertained that the periodical
flux had taken place exactly one week before the woman made the attempt on her
life; and with regard to the subsequent history of the case, it may be said that she
was laid up with the wound in her throat for a period of twenty-four days before her
death, nineteen of which were passed in a separate ward of the Hospital, where, in
consequence of her yery distressing condition, she was closely watched by a female
attendant, so that it is hardly possible that sexual intercourse could have been effected
during that period of time.
