Hence the difference of the values of the denominators of the F series
of Al and Tl is $('134153—‘001754) = ‘06620, whilst the values found are
*962611—"956239 = 006372, sufficiently close to show that the above explanation
may be on the right lines. The fact that ‘014 and ‘0437 are in the ratio 1 : 3, i.c., of
the valencies of the Groups I. and III., may be a coincidence, but should be borne in
mind for future testing. The results for these two groups suggest a similar kind of
group constant for Zn and the Mg sub-groups of IT., but if so no F series have yet
been observed to determine them. It is at least to the point to notice that such a
term would raise the coefficients of the Zn set (002715) more to an equality with the
values (‘002755) of the Al set.
