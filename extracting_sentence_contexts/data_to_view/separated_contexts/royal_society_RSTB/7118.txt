This is probably due to the fact that he had exposed larvae
without food. Subsequently, he (1933, p. 198) observed even that at 70% r.u. and 35° C
the larvae of this species did not develop successfully. The fact that the larvae of this species
survived in my experiments under almost identical conditions of temperature and humidity
is possibly due to the better nutritive conditions. Though 80% R.u. improved the larval developmental rate of the three species a good
deal at 35° C, yet it exercised a desiccating influence. Owing to a great adverse effect of
this temperature on the larvae of X. brasiliensis (table 25), the drying effect of this humidity

was most marked, as the larvae died in all instars; many of them reached the resting stage,
and some even spun cocoons, but none pupated.
