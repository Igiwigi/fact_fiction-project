For
radiation experiments it may be made more sensitive than the thermopile (cf. LANGLEYâ€™s
Bolometer) ; owing to its great sensitiveness, it may be used to measure rapidly varying
temperature without inaccuracy ; this is often desirable, as in calorimetry by method
of cooling. There is, in fact, hardly any experimental investigation in which the
measurement of temperature is necessary, which may not be more accurately and
simply effected by means of a suitable platinum wire thermometer. [The results of the investigation considered as a research on the resistance-
variation of metals tend to prove the existence of minute irregularities which
