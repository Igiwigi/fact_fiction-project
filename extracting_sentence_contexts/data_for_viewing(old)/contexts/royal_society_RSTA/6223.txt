for all w € V. Setting this w in such a way that w + yuc(t) + u/(t) = v and using (3.7), we arrive at
(3.6). |

As a result of proposition 3.6, it suffices to solve an equation problem for obtaining we.
Furthermore, since it follows from (3.7) that

ov (Ue) = Be(Lyvev + ueyll), or (we) =ae([u.-]) on (0,T) x Iv,

we expect that u< should converge to a solution of the original problem (3.1) as € — 0. Justification
of this fact, which is actually the idea to prove theorem 3.4, is the task of the next section.

4. Proof of main result

In this section, we establish existence in §4a-d and uniqueness in §4e. Coercivity of a(-,-) in V,
that is,

a(v,v) > Clo wwev,
