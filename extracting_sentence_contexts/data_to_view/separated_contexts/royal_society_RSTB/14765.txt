We speculate that the shift in
pronunciation arose in the first half of the twentieth century, possibly
owing to the article by Hyke& [110] or a similar one, where the Czech
writers tried to avoid the letter ‘é’ not present in most alphabets.
‘Purkyné and ‘Purkinje’ are pronounced almost identically in
Czech, which is why the authors may have thought the latter to be
a good substitute. In addition, it is pronounced similarly to the
Czech pronunciation in German, which was the other major aca-
demic language in the region in late nineteenth/early twentieth
century. However, the pronunciation in English is very different,
probably underlying the divergence of pronunciation from the orig-
inal, despite the fact that Hyke’ does suggest how to pronounce
the name in his article (‘poorkeynie’). References
