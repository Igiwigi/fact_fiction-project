anterior commissure and its posterior extension. Now this triangular area is the
deeper portion of the pyriform region recognised at the base as GRATIOLET'S olfactory
area. Closely examined by a hand magnifier we now see the very peculiar structure
alluded to as the © olfactory lyre.” Gently raise by the needle the posterior olfactory
fasciculus and examine also with a lens. From its anterior border arise numerous
delicate fibres constituting more or less fine faxciculi, the largest arising near the
anterior commissure, whilst a few delicate offsets are given off from the commissure
itself. Whilsb these fasciculi curve inwards and appear continuous with the olfactory
tract into and through the commissure, other fasciculi may be seen passing through the
stracture of the posterior olfactory band directly backwards, separating its strands and
emerging behind to enter this region of the corpus striatum. raced forwards these
delicate fasciculi lie parallel to and on a plane with the central olfactory fasciculus,
forming as it were a floor for this triangular space (the strands of the lyre), and in fact
sharply defining the upper limits of the olfactory area from the structure of the
caudate nucleus proper. With the scissors divide these fibres along their line of
connexion to the posterior olfactory tract, and teaze out with the needle the structures
lying immediately beneath. We now see by means of a low power, and even by the
naked eye, the coarse fasciculi enclosing betwixt their strands the oval grey nuclei of
the olfactory area, Next, by a delicate disxection with needle and moistened brush,
the posterior olfactory fasciculus may be followed from the outer margin of the striate
nucleus backwards ; its brush-like division here sending a small detachment of fibres
upwards along the outer aspect of the corpus striatum to reach the vertex. The
