After briefly introducing these two
phenomena and their neural interpretation, the remainder of this review is organized as follows:
In ยง2, we emphasize the significance of connectivity and complexity in the neural system. In ยง3,
we present a representative mathematical expression of resonance behaviour and widely used
metrics for evaluating it. Then, in ยง4, we discuss in detail recent SR and VR studies investigating
the effects of various biophysical facts on the weak signal detection performance in neuronal
networks. Finally, we summarize the review with concluding remarks in ยง5.

2. Significance of neuronal connectivity

In line with the technological advances across recent decades, the knowledge on neuronal
connectivity has been advanced with different neuroimaging methods including functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS), arterial spin labeling (ASL), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
and magnetoencephalography (MEG) [27-29].
