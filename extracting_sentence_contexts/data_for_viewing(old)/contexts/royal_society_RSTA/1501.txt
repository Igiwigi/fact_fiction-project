and orientations). The LiveFFT window (e) can be accessed from the live preview window (d) (with (g) being the inspection
window), the bright spots in the live FFT window correspond to the frequency and orientation of the real space sinusoidal

path after the dichroic reflector. The microscope used a lower magnification silicone immersion
objective lens (30x /1.05 UPLSAPO30XS, Olympus), to provide a larger FoV at the expense of
a small reduction in spatial resolution. Images were recorded with a CCD camera (ORCA R2,
Hamamatsu). Advance of bitplanes in the SLM running order was again initiated by TTL signals
from the camera, but in this case repeated through a microcontroller (Arduino Mega 2560) to
improve the fast-switching TTL signal at high frame rates. One limitation of this system stems
from the reduced triggering functionality of the camera and the fact that the camera controller
continually emitted a heartbeat of HIGH to LOW TTL signals independently of image acquisition.
This meant it was not possible to reset the running order of SLM bitplanes at the start of each
image acquisition resulting in a variable ordering of raw images in each SIM image sequence. To
accommodate this, each image sequence was reordered post-capture as a first step in the image
reconstruction process.

6. Calibration, image reconstruction and testing

Both SIM microscopes are calibrated by imaging a pre-prepared slide of fluorescent microspheres
(PS-Speck, Thermo Fisher Scientific) deposited onto a (#1.5H) coverslip. After air drying, a
drop of hard curing mountant (ProLong Gold, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added and a glass
microscope slide was placed on top. The monolayers of closely packed microspheres which form
