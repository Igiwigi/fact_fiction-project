in alcohol-dependent subjects when compared with rec-
reational alcohol drinkers [91]. A link to the dominance of
habitual behaviour in addiction was further shown in alco-
hol-dependent individuals who displayed an overreliance on
S-R learning that was associated with increased activation of
the posterior putamen, a region mediating habitual behaviour,
and decreased activation of the ventromedial PFC and anterior
putamen, a region involved in goal-directed learning [92]. Intri-
guingly, the ventral-to-dorsal striatal transition has also been
demonstrated in a behavioural addiction—internet gaming
disorder. Those with the disorder showed higher CS-induced
activations than healthy controls in both ventral and dorsal
striatum. But, activity in the left ventral striatum was, in fact,
negatively correlated with CS-elicited craving, which was
instead positively correlated with activations in the right
dorsal striatum (putamen) and left caudate nucleus [93].
These data indicate that the intrastriatal transitions we have
demonstrated in rats seeking cocaine and recently heroin
(R Hodebourg, JE Murray, M Fouyssac, M Puaud, BJ Everitt,
D Belin 2017, unpublished), and seen in humans addicted to
drugs, may not be restricted to drug-induced plasticity in this
circuitry. In human subjects engaged in learning a virtual
maze task that revealed individual differences in spatial
versus stimulus—response navigational strategies, response
learners who had greater use of abused substances than spatial
