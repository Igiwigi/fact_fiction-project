Bacteria, for instance, have been shown to respond to the
secretion of exoproducts such as iron-sequestering sidero-
phores by secreting these substances themselves (([226];
reviewed in [227,228]), even though ‘cheaters’ could potentially
exploit their siderophore production [229-232], showing the
essential contingency inherent in the decision process involved
in generalized reciprocity. Therefore, if there is no mechanism
selecting against this simple contingency, generalized recipro-
city can be expected to be a ubiquitous phenomenon. As

outlined above, several studies have in fact suggested that
the conditions for generalized reciprocity to evolve are very
widespread [41,42,48,49,52-54].

(b) Time lag between cooperative acts

The time structure of reciprocity may take two forms: simul-
taneous and successive exchange of service and commodities. This difference is significant, since reciprocal exchanges separ-
ated by a time delay are far more vulnerable to exploitation
by cheaters.

(i) Simultaneous exchange of services, trading of commodities
and cooperative coaction: As outlined above, when a
cooperative act is contingent on an immediate response
of the receiver, exploitation is easily avoided [38]. The
decision to withhold effort if help is not reciprocated
can be made ‘in real time’, i.e. the trading of commod-
ities is transparent to all partners involved.
