upwards from the base of the brain. Nevertheless, total deprivation of blood imme-
diately paralyses the brain.

One fact which has become clear to me is that the degree of anzemia required to
produce dementia in the monkey is separated by the narrowest line from that which
produces coma and paralysis of the respiratory centre. In only one monkey have I
been able to obtain the stage of dementia. In the other animals there have followed
either no symptoms or death in a few hours.

The experiments, lastly, seem to prove that the anzemic theory of sleep is insufti-
cient. The brain no doubt becomes more congested with venous blood, and the
arterial pressure falls; but I have determined by sphygmometer records* that the
fall of pressure is not greater during sleep than during mental work in the reeumbent
position. In recumbency, with complete muscular relaxation and shallow respiration,
the blood congests on the venous side, the heart decreases in rate, and the circulation
is rendered more sluggish ; but these changes do not in themselves produce sleep.
