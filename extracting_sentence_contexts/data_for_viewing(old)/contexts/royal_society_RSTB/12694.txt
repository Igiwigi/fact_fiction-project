Figure 2. TE-derived cis-regulatory elements. (a) Here, we review TEsâ€™ role in gene expression via enhancers, promoters, boundary elements and silencers. (6) TE-
derived enhancers act distally as either intergenic (upper panel) or intronic (lower panel). (c) TEs contribute promoters either as alternative promoters driving
chimeric transcripts (upper panel) or as a replacement for the canonical promoter (lower panel). (d) TE-derived boundary elements contribute to topologically
associated domains (TADs) by providing CTCF-binding sites (upper panel) and also maintain TADs by TE transcription (lower panel). (e) TEs can also act as a silencer
by spreading heterochromatin (upper panel) or stalling Pol I elongation (lower panel).

this picture changes in preimplantation embryos and pluripo- permissive epigenetic state associated with global DNA

young LTRs in naive pluripotency may not only result from regulatory activity. One such example of a TE is HERV-H
