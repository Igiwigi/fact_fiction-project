14. The section is sufficiently radial to follow the narrow base (a) of
the sporangium through almost its whole length, and to show the vascular bundle for
some distance. That it is not, however, in a strictly vertical plane is proved by the
too small height of the “seed,” and by the fact that it is closed in above by the
integument ; a truly radial section would of course follow the micropylar opening in
this region. As a matter of fact, the narrow ridge of the “seed,” where the
micropyle is situated, is missed (as is almost always the case) by the plane of section. The figure is, however, interesting, because it shows how, as the sporangium narrows
out towards the distal extremity, the integument, roofing it in above, approaches the
ascending lamina, and eventually meets and joins the latter.
