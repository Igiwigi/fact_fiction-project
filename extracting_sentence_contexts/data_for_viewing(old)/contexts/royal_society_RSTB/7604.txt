I am now of the opinion that the middle of Orangerie bay should be regarded as the

mainland area from Mullens harbour to East cape, and then the Massim archipelagos
are dealt with. It is, however, more convenient to describe in another section the pipes
of the north coast of Papua from East cape to the northern boundary, irrespective of the
fact that the stretch of coast from East cape to Collingwood bay is generally considered
