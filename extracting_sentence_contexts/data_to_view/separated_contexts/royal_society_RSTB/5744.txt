The size of the brain case being apparently limited, the nervous substance fills up all
the space available. This also happens in th√© midbrain, the ventricle of which is
equally reduced, while the tecta optica are pushed down by the caudal pole of the fore-
brain, thus making as much use as possible of the available endocranial space. Anyone who has dissected an avian brain knows how closely the central nervous
system in these animals lies against the neurocranium, a fact also demonstrated by

'T. Eprycer (1929), who showed that on an endocranial cast of a bird practically all the
details of its external brain morphology may be observed, even the fine cerebellar fissures. As this holds good for small as well as for large species it seems that space economy acts
a part in this peculiar condition.
