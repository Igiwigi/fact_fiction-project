Blue Coloration of the Corallum. The corallum of eliopor is coloured of a deep blue, and has always been regarded
as remarkable amongst corals for this fact. Now that it is known to be an Aleyonarian
structure the fact is less exceptional, since both Corallium and Tubipora have a deeply
coloured corallum, and many other Alcyonarians have coloured spicules. Amongst Hexac-
tinians Stylasterf ro80ceus is of an intense red, and the corallum of some Fungias is also
red; also that of certain Eupsammide, but amongst these the condition is exceptional,

The blue tint is seen in sections of the corallum to be diffused within the hard tissue. The colouris faint or almost absent in the freshly growing tips of the corallum, and pale in
the most recently formed superficial structures generally ; it is darkest in the layer be-
neath these in the recently matured tissue.
