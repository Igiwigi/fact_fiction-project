This brings us to the possibility that the colours of Metridium are non-significant in
Poultonâ€™s sense. As Sumner (1937) says, much of the colouring of animals may be a
mere by-product of their metabolism, having no relation to ecological needs. The
colours may be incidental properties of molecules concerned with other biochemical
events. It is significant that in the colour patterns of anemones the pigments tend to
accentuate morphological axes of differentiation (Stephenson 1928). The processes
which produce the one may be those that produce the other.

On this view the colour varieties of Metridium are comparable to random mutations
in systems serving other biological ends than coloration. In some anemones the
resulting colours may be utilized as an adaptation, though the idea of adaptation
must be qualified when it concerns simple physiological processes (Pantin 1932).
Whether or not this proves to be true the fact remains that the Actinozoa are the most

brilliantly coloured of all animals, and it seems at first sight against probability if this
occurrence of bright colours in so many individual species and varieties is not corre-
lated with some unique metabolic characters of the group. But let it be remembered
that it is the brilliance of the colours and not their presence which is the feature of
these animals. Some tissues of almost all animals contain bright pigments, and
colourless animals are the exception. Among the higher animals, however, the
exterior coloration is usually arranged in a drab protective pattern in adaptation to
the environment; though the component pigments may be bright. Many physio-
