Taking the average of these five instances as a sample of the effect of a vegetable diet
on the liver of the dog, it appears that the organ rather more than equals in ounces the
number of pounds the animal weighs. It will be remembered that, after an animal
diet, the average given was rather under the half ounce to the pound. The facts as to
the amount of amyloid substance stand thus :—

No analyses were made of the livers of the dogs Nos. 12 and 13, but the quantity of
amyloid substance was unusually large. It was whilst examining these livers for the
determination of sugar that I was first led to notice the effect of a vegetable diet that I

am now describing.
