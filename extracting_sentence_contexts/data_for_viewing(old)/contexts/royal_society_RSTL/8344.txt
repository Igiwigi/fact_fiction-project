A preliminary comparison of the ordinary absorption-spectrum of a stratum of 6 feet
of chlorine renders it not improbable that chlorine at a low temperature is the cause
of some of the FrRauNnorER lines in the violet, although, as said before, T have not yet
obtained certain evidence as to the reyersal of the bright lines of chlorine seen in the

x jar-spark.
| There is also an apparent coincidence between some of the faint FrRavxnorER lines
+ and some of the lines of the low temperature absorption-spectrum of iodine.
S Should subsequent researches strengthen the probability of this working hypothesis,
'2 it 8eems possible that iron meteorites will be associated with the metallic stars and stony
E meteorites with metalloidal and compound stars. Of the iron group of metals in the
S gun, iron and nickel are those which exist in greatest quantity, as I have determined
E from the number of lines reversed. Other striking facts, such as the presence of
| 2 hydrogen in meteorites, might also be referred to.

> An interesting physical speculation connected with this working hypothesis is the
Z effect on the period of duration of a star's heat which would be brought about by
Sz asming that the original atoms of which a star is composed are possessed with the
J increased potential energy of combination which this hypothesis endows them with.
> Prom the earlicst phase of a star's life the dissipation of energy would, as it were, bring
2 into play a new supply of heat, and 8 prolong the star's light.

May it not also be that if chemists take up this question which has arisen from the
E gpectroscopic evidence of what I haye before termed the plasticity of the molecules of
Â© - the metalloids taken as a whole, much of the power of variation which is at present
