Figure 5 also shows curves representing the theoretical estimates of the abundance of
recoil tracks, based on the Rutherford formula and on the known composition of the emulsion

material, namely, 3-4g./c.c. of silver bromide and 0-54¢./c.c. of gelatin. In calculating

these curves, the range-velocity relations for light recoils were taken from the data of Knipp

& Teller (1941), and the following figures were adopted for the mean mass, charge, and
initial energy of the fission fragments:

M=120, z=45, E=80MeV. In general, the theoretical curves lie above the experimental values, in accordance with the

fact that the theory does not take into account screening effects. The existence of maxima

in the graphs is due to the lower limit of acceptance of particle ranges; as is well known, if

this limit is reduced to zero, the formulae for the collision cross-sections become divergent. The total abundance of recoils of the two types was also determined.
