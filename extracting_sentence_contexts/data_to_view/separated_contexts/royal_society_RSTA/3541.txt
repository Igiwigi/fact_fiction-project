But no effect whatever was produced in the photographsâ€”doubt-
less because the gases were still burning. Indeed, most of the photographs show that
the region is only comparatively dark. I would draw attention to the fact that when no sound-waves interfere with the
flame, the retonation-wave is very brilliant ; when the flame is crossed several times
BS by reflected waves, the light is more evenly distributed. Nos. 63 and 64, taken under
@the same conditions, illustrate this fact.
