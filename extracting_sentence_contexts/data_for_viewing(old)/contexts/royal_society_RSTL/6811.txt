mumber of lines. And 80 S(m, n, p) denotes the Skew Surface or Scroll generated by
a line which meets the curves m, 7, p each once, or else it denotes the order of swch
surface,

4. G(m, , p, q): the signification is explained above.

9. S(m, n,p): the ignification has just been explained ; but as the surfaces S(m, n,P),

$(m?, n), $(12?) are in fact the subject of the present memoir, I give the explanation in
full for each of them, viz. S(m, 2, p) is the surface generated by a line which meets the
curyes MM, 7, p each once; S(m?, n) is the surface generated by a line which meets the
curye m twice and the curye % once; S$(m?) the surface generated by the line which
meets the curve m thrice. As already mentioned, these surfaces and their orders are
represented by the same symbols respectively.

6. ND(m, n, p). The directrix curves m, n, p of the scroll $(m, n, p) are nodal (mul-
tiple) curves on the surface, viz. m is an ap-tuple curve, and so for and p. Reckoning
each curye according to its multiplicity, yiz. the curye 1 being reckoned 4[npP times, or
as of the order m.3[np], and 80 for the curyes 7 and p, the aggregate, or 8wm of the
orders, gives the Nodal Director ND(m, n, p).
