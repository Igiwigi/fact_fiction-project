It was also shown (Whipple &
Lee 1935) that the compressibility of the water makes little difference to the general result.} A further difficulty was that investigation of the wave periods usually showed them to be
considerably greater than the corresponding periods of the microseisms. Bernardâ€™s careful
studies of the periods of swell off the coast of Morocco (1937, 1941 4, 4) indicated that they
were in fact about twice the microseism periods. In a comparison of the Kew seismograms
with records of waves taken at Perranporth in Cornwall, Deacon (1947) independently
arrived at the same conclusion. It has been pointed out (Longuet-Higgins & Ursell 1948) that Miche, in a theoretical
study of wave motion (1944), discovered that the mean pressure on the bottom beneath a
train of standing waves is not constant, as in a progressive wave, but fluctuates with an
amplitude independent of the depth and proportional to the square of the wave height.
