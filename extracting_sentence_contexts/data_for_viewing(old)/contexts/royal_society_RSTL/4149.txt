any possible action of the substance employed, will be evident from the paper itself,
in which I have called attention to the general production of catalytic effects by
solid bodies.

Whatever value or novelty there may be in the facts I have communicated, is the
same whether they be regarded as resulting from catalytic or from thermic actions.
If the action be catalytic, it is one absolutely the reverse of that usually produced by
platinum, and therefore just as much at variance with received experience as decom-
position of water by heat would be; the effect of platinum, like that of heat, on the
elements of water having been hitherto known only as combining them. With regard
to any theoretic views I may have advanced, I by no means attach the same import-
ance to them as I do to the facts themselves, though I consider it necessary for the
collation of facts, and desirable for the progress of science, that an author pretending
to communicate new results should give with them the impressions which led to their
discovery, and the inferences which he regards as immediately deducible from them.
No expression can be given to facts which does not involve some theory, and ad-
mitting the difficulty (perbaps insuperable) of correctly enunciating new phenomena,
and the probability of future discoveries entirely changing our views regarding them,
I cannot at present see that the title of my paper could be altered without being
open to greater objections. I am of this opinion, not s0 much because other bodies
than platinum will produce the effect, as I shall presently show, nor from the fact
that the electrical spark will decompose aqueous vapour, though these are arguments
in its favour; but from the following considerations. The catalytic action of plati-
num will induce or enable combination to take place where there is already a strong
affinity or tendency to combine, as with mixed oxygen and hydrogen gases ; it will
