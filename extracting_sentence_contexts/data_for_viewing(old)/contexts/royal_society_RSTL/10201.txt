verschiebungen” are the causes of the electrical changes obgerved, the proof being,
that in general © Wasserverschiebungen in imbibirten Kirpern” are attended with
electrical phenomena. He confesses himself unable to connect the particular phe-
nomena observed with © einzelne Phasen prevalirender Wasserverschiebungen.” He
thinks, however, that the first © Vorschlag” is not due to Wasserverschiebung, but to
the fact that the diffusion processes which are called into existence by the application
of the electrodes are disturbed by alterations in the protoplagm. Tt is to be noticed
that these explanations, which are contained in the concluding paragraph of the paper,
are not in accordance with the more general statement on p. 371. In one place it is
stated that © all electrical phenomena are conditioned by Wasserverschiebung yan
the other, that the Vorschlag in Mimosd © cannot be referred to Wasserverschaebung,
but to the alteration of protoplasm which precedes it.” The difference is a fundamental
one.

From the preceding pages it will be seen that the two observers who have investi-
gated the electromotive phenomena which are associated with the excitatory process,
viz. : Professxor MUNK and Professor KUNKEL, have arrived at opposite conclusions as
to their nature. According to MuXKx, the electromotive activity of the plant cell
