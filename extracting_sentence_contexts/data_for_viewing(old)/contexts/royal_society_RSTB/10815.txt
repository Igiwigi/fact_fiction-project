heterosynaptic plasticity. Intuitively, the measured synaptic
weights become ‘sticky’ and are always attracted back
to their momentary stable state, ie. weak or strong. This
prediction requires future experimental clarification.

The path towards saturation of synaptic weights during a pair-
ing experiment (figure 8) is vital to building better plasticity
models. Virtually any information which helps theorists to

constrain how the synaptic weight increases would be help-
ful. Importantly, this also includes any information about
conditions (or experimental protocols) which do not induce
plasticity, despite the fact that either the presynaptic or the
postsynaptic neuron or both have been activated.

11. Condusion

One of the most striking differences between plasticity models
and experimental data concerns their timescales. Hebbian plas-
ticity can be induced within seconds to minutes [45,68,69,87].
In simulated network models, a similarly fast form of Hebbian
plasticity leads to runaway activity within seconds, unless
Hebbian plasticity is complemented with RCPs. Here, ‘rapid’
means that these changes need to take effect after seconds or
at most a few minutes [26]. This, however, is much faster
