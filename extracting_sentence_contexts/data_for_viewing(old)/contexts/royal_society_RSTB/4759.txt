It would seem, further, that Hasse changed his views during the interval that
supervened between the publication of his Allgemeiner Theil in 1879 and the
appearance of the second Lieferung of his Besonderer Theil in 1882; in the
g former he remarks (15, A, p. 47) that in the Trygon family the four oblique rays
a of the eight-rayed star seen in a transverse section of the centrum are calcifications of
4 the arch-bases, and the vertical and horizontal rays are developed from external
a perichondrium ; but, in his contribution of 1882, he affixes the mark a’ to one of the
a oblique rays of Urolophus auwrantiacus and to one of the lateral rays of Teniwra
lymna (16, C, Plate 19, figs. 9 and 16), the mark @ standing for “ Aussenlage
~ der Aussenzone.” It is only fair to add that, on p. 146, he expresses himself’ as
8 somewhat in doubt about the matter, owing to there being no traces of the
< membrana elastica externa recognisable, and to the fact that he was unable to
Za investigate the matter developmentally ; he notes that the vertical and lateral
3 rays reach the perichondrium, and are reinforced by it, and he remarks that
2 K6LLIKER was of opinion that they were “ periostale Keile,” ¢.e., situated external to
8 the sheath-cartilage.

3 As regards the concentric character of the deposit in those Plagiostomi tecto-
& spondyli that show stellate patterns, it is true that, in his figures of Trygonorhina
4 fasciata, Narecine brasiliensis, and Torpedo sp. (15, C, Plate 15, fig. 49; Plate 23,
= figs. 21 and 14), he shows lines of the successive deposits, such that, if these are
6 continued from ray to ray across the intervening tracts of cartilage, they yield
3 a series of concentric circles, but, on the other hand, similar zones of growth are
g shown in his figures of the radiating laminze that occur in a number of forms that he
