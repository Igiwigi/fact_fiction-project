Prime Panels was instructed to
supply a minimum of 432 complete and valid datasets (approx.
n=54 per condition). After applying a priori rejection and exclu-
sion criteria (see electronic supplementary material for details),
the final sample for analysis comprised N = 429 participants (203
males, 225 females, 1 participant of undisclosed gender; mean
age M=47.59 years (s.d.= 15.87; range 18-94)).° Participants
were rewarded for their participation as agreed upon with the
platform through which they entered the experimental survey. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four exper-
imental conditions, with the constraint of approximately equal
cell sizes.

(b) Materials

(i) Scenarios

Participants were presented with a fictitious report concerning a
research study that purportedly found that politicians of either
the Democratic or Republican Party were three times as likely to
embezzle funds compared to the rival party (based on [59]); the
scenario is provided in the electronic supplementary material. Each report comprised 10 statements, with the key information
presented in statement 4, which was retracted or not retracted in
statement 9, depending on condition. For example, statement 4
in the Democratic worldview-congruent conditions stated that
‘The study found that Republican politicians over the last three
decades were more than three times as likely to misappropriate
public funds compared to Democratic politicians’.
