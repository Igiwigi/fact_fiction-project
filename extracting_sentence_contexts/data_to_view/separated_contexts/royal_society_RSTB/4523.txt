The gonads
and the associated parts attain as large a size, and are as completely developed, as
in the winged males and females prior to leaving their nest. It has already been
pointed out that it is possible to select a series of species in which the gonads of
the sterile castes exhibit progressive stages in reduction, until we â€˜reach the condition
found in Butermes monoceros, where they are apparently wanting altogether. This
fact itself affords strong evidence in support of the conclusion that caste production
is not in any way associated with the condition of the gonads. E. OBSERVATIONS ON THE BroLoGy OF THE SPECIES. So far as known this Termite is restricted in the distribution to the North-West
