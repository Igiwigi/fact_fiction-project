For
instance, it is crucial in determining the flow separation points for bodies without sharp corners
in super- and transcritical flow conditions. Even though free vorticity flow becomes turbulent at
much lower Reynolds numbers than for boundary layer flow, turbulence modelling is believed
to be secondary when flow separation from a sharp corner occurs. However, the fact that
turbulent diffusion of free vorticity flow is much larger than viscous diffusion does have an
effect, in particular in ambient oscillatory flow. We are not aware of quantitative investigations
of the latter effect with relevance to our problem. Turbulent flow modelling would require a
three-dimensional model.
