But it is evident that an error of 0°03 mm. in outlining
the chromosomes, or in measuring the widths of the drawing when finished, would
vitiate the calculated accuracy of the chromosome width by approximately 0°01 p. We mention this in order to show that, in our opinion, very little reliance can be
placed on the value represented by the second place of decimals, in spite of the
fact that the measurements, as given by Mrgk, are always exactly the same. Thus,
the width of every chromosome of the higher Metazoan nuclei is stated to be
precisely 0°83 p. We have made repeated measurements of the same individual chromosome under
various conditions and at different times and dates, in order to arrive at some know-
ledge of the limits of personal error in so far as we ourselves were concerned.
