this regard is associated with the contribution from topological effects, which was here restricted
only to a simple implementation of the confining tube concept [21,22], and even more limited
to relations between the change of surface elements (3.14) and the tube diameter d. Although
the elaboration of this concept already encompasses a broad spectrum of models, the ‘tube
contraction’ [25] itself (equation (2.1)2) would generally allow for a more general dependence
on F than is contained in (3.15), potentially giving rise to further expressions that comply
with those phenomenological models, and particularly to terms that include both I; and 15.
Darabi & Itskov [34], for example, recently proposed a model for the constraint contribution
that combines ideas from the tube and slip-link [80] theories. The corresponding expression
for the free energy (eqn 27 in [34]) cannot be brought in the form (3.15) with only positive
constants.
In light of the previous considerations, the known proximity of the Arruda—Boyce and Gent
models is based on the fact that they differ only in the representation of the chain force, ie. a
single variation within the four-step procedure, which allows them to be distinguished from each
other. Such single variations lead to what we will refer to as ‘close relatives’ and which we will
analyse in the next section with respect to Ogden’s model in a molecular statistical form (3.19) as
a basis.

5. Variations on Ogden’s model

The incompressible Ogden model [1] in its unaltered original form is indisputably one of the
most successful and versatile hyperelastic approaches to studying rubber elasticity, with many
uses even beyond this class of materials. Notwithstanding, a study of some of its close relatives
will provide a new perspective on this important milestone of phenomenological rubber-elasticity
theory, and moreover indicate a few other models with similar capacities to the original.
