ZUsing these relations, it follows from (8.1) that

a.(R:a) = Na(R:a) RK, = Na(R,:a) =NR, = KR.

$ The following simple result belonging to the same order of ideas is also used in Part I:

% (8.8) Suppose ® has only one maximal ideal P. Ifa subset YW of the quotient field of R
generates a principal ideal, (Ql) = 6, then a generating element for (WY) can be selected

Strom A.
2 In fact, At bP provided b+ 0; and any element of bR not in df is an associate of b.

4 Some results in the theory of commutative algebras, which find numerous applications in
2 art I, are given here. In this section, A denotes a commutative algebra over a field f, of
P&nite rank m> 0. It is assumed that A has unity, denoted by ¢, and that 1.¢ = ¢, where 1 is the
“unity element of f. The zero elements of A and f are denoted by 0 and 0 respectively.

The definition of the regular representation, and definitions of the characteristic poly-
