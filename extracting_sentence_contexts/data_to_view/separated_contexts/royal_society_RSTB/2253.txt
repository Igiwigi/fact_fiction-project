By the 123rd day there was still further improvement to record, for now the
appearance of unilateral facial paralysis when the face was in repose was much less,
although, on movements of the face being made, the paralysed condition was still
quite evident. The orbicularis palpebrarum remained much as at the 49th day. An
improvement, however, consisted in the fact that she was no longer troubled with
food lodging between the gums and cheek. When she lay down she could close the
eye fully. By the 141st day the faradie irritability had improved, as now not only did the
orbicularis palpebrarum respond, but the angle of the mouth was drawn up on
applying the electrode.
