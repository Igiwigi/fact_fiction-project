{ The middle position is probably nearest to the truth,
viz., that while in the first instance smaller-leaved forms gave rise to the larger-leaved
plants which we call “ Ferns,” conversely, certain of the latter may, along lines of
reduction, have eventuated in smaller-leaved Gymnospermic types. We shall,
therefore, start from the position that im the evolution of the Ferns some such
leaf-cnlargment as is faintly indicated in certain other Pteridophyta was carried out
here to a higher degree than in any other Archegoniate plants ; in fact, that the Ferns
are essentially strobiloid types which have attained to large and complex leaves.§

* © Annals of Botany,’ vol. 3, p. 359, where the results of study of the wings of various Fern-leaves are
summarised, It is shown that while a definite marginal series of cells, with definite segmentation, is found
in the Polypodiacew, the Marattiaceze and Osmundacer (excluding filmy Todeas) have no single marginal
series, but the wings when young are composed of cells showing the (T) division, such as are found in the
leaves of other Pteridophytes (compare, /.c., Plate 23, figs. 60 and 70-73, with Giick’s figs.
