By forming the usual piles with frozen and unfrozen muscles
opposed, we acquire the certainty that the frozen muscles have lost their electromotive
power, but not their conductivity. If we operate on muscles of frogs which have perished
in nitrous or hydrosulphuric acid, we obtain the same results as from frozen museles. PROFESSOR MATTEUCCT'S ELECTRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCHES. 135

Before quitting this subject, 1 gladly avail myself of this opportunity of mentioning an
important fact discovered by M. Du Bots ReyMoxd. From the period of my earliest re-
searches in electro-physiology, I had vainly endeavoured to obtain electrical phenomena
from the nerves of a living animal, or of one recently killed; and even now it is demonstrated,
that, notwithstanding the use of the most delicate modern galvanometers, no sign of elec-
trical current is to be obtained from a nerve laid bare in a living animal and left in its
natural state, M.
