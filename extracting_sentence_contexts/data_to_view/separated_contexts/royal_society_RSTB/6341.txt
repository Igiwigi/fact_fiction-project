The observations show very clearly that the
switch over from the oestrous to the pseudo-pregnant condition in the rat must be
due to a change in the anterior pituitary and not merely to the corpus luteum which
is formed in any case, whether a stimulus is applied or not. SrLye and McKeown
(1934) have shown that mechanical stimulation of the nipple without the withdrawal
of milk (as after the removal of the galactophores) in both rats and mice, also pro-
duces a prolongation in the duration of the corpora lutea, but the stimulus must be
continued if this effect is to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is

normally essential for the continuance of lactation in mammals is similarly to be
accounted for on the assumption that exteroceptive stimuli are conveyed from the
nipples to the anterior pituitary by nervous paths. And the further fact that
menstruation in women in about 60%, of cases is inhibited by suckling is perhaps also
relevant. General evidence of a functional correlation between the hypothalamus and the
gonads is furnished by the described effects of hypothalamic lesions in inducing the
symptoms of dystrophia adiposo-genitalis.
