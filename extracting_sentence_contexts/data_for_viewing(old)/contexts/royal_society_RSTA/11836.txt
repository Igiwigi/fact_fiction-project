In this equation the terms not involving the exponential cancel by (37) and (
The equation therefore can be satisfied by some value of p, which fact verifies :

If m= n= 0, this equation does not hold. In this case the equation to
surface is k = b(1 + fe). Now, from (35) the force on the surface of the

F EF ,
Putting therefore b + be in place of b, the force becomes
