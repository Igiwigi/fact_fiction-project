Here, I will argue that the initial impetus for Price’s foray into
mathematical population genetics stemmed from a preoccupation with the
origins of family, one that was born following a divorce from his wife and
the abandonment of their two young girls. What is special about the Price
equation is the way in which it associates statistically between two groups,

relatedness in the narrow sense of direct descent, and it allows us to see
selection working at different levels simultaneously, a fact that was not
lost on William Hamilton. Hamilton was one of the few friends who despe-
