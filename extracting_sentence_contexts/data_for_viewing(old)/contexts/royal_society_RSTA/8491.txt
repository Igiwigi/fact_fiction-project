Of this long list of rotations, only 9 remained completely unidentified, since of the 22
readings which did not correspond with any known iron line, 13 were found to be due to
known impurities in the iron are; but 15 other readings of the ‘‘ quartz” series were
classed with the “ unidentified’ lines because the nearest known wave-length gave
errors > 0-03° or 0-04°/mm., and in the same way 3 readings of the “ glass ” series were
omitted from the subsequent calculations because the nearest known line gave errors
> 0-016°/mm. In addition, 51 readings of the old series and 5 readings of the new series
were of lines for which no modern wave-lengths were available, so that it was impossible
to deduce trustworthy values for the calculated rotations. Finally, 37 of the tabulated
readings of the old series and 18 of the new series were found to correspond with close
doublets, or with a line carrying a satellite, and these gave differences (enclosed in square
brackets) which were also omitted from the subsequent calculations, in spite of the fact
that the weighted mean of the calculated rotations was usually in excellent agreement
with the observed rotation. ‘Table VI therefore includes 804 cases in which the
