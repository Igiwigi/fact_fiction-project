inertia from attaining any sensible velocity before the force is reversed ; so that in
neither way can the propagation of electric displacement across the medium be
sensibly affected by the presence of the molecules. The formula shows, however,
that the damping effect of conductivity usually persists to higher periods than the
simple refracting effect of the excited vibrations,

The theory of dispersion would assume a simpler form if the molecules were
systems vibrating about positions of equilibrium, instead of about states of steady
motion. In that case the coefficients ¢)9, e5,.... €, are null: the restoring forces,
proportional to the velocities, to which these belong, are in fact introduced by the
steady motions, and may be named, after Lord Ketvry, motional gyrostatic forces ;
they evidence themselves by causing slow precessional oscillations. The positional
gyrostatic forces, or centrifugal forces proper, are merged in T —- W along with the
forces arising from the potential energy.* When these motional forces are absent,
we have 6, = ¢,P,/(a, — A, p*) and similarly, so that f/P, = %¢,°/(a, — A, p*); and
as before, in a transparent medium, (K’ — 1)/(K’ + 2) = $a0°P,-! nf. Thus the
values of 9), Jo, + +++ g, ave in this case all positive; so that, if this represented the
facts, the fragments of a horizontal spectrum, with red on the left, would after
further refraction by a prism of anomalous material with its edge horizontal and
uppermost, all slope upwards from left to right. On the other hand, each change of
sign from positive to negative among the successive values of 9), J)... +g, would
give two fragments of the spectrum which would be curved back so as to be highest
