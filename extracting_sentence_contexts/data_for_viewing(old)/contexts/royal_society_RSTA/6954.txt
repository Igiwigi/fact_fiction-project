correlation u,(0) w’,(z) it is clear that periodicities incompatible with Rayleigh’s criterion
(29) cannot occur in the present analysis. An alternative way of describing the situation is
as follows: Consider an extensive medium (stratified in planes perpendicular to the vertical)
of depth H in which a constant mean adverse temperature gradient —|/| is maintained.
By Rayleigh’s criterion (2) (or correctly by the criterion derived from Jeffreys’s differential
equation (22) by satisfying the proper boundary conditions at the top and the bottom
surfaces of the fluid) there will be convection in the medium. Consider a portion of the
fluid far from the bounding surfaces so that the assumption of homogeneity may be approxi-
mately realized. Equation (223) would then apply and has the meaning that in a Fourier
analysis of correlations such as u,(0) w/,(z) wave-lengths less than A,,;, cannot occur. Also,
for A =A,,i, both ¢ and v2 vanish. It is evident now that A,,;, must agree with Rayleigh’s
criterion (29) (not (2)). On the other hand, the agreement of (223) with Rayleigh’s criterion
(29) should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the physical situations contemplated
on the two theories are entirely different. As we have already remarked the Rayleigh-

* Notice, however, that we are not comparing it with the criterion (2) given by Rayleigh for the stability
of a layer of liquid of height H.


TURBULENCE CAUSED BY THERMAL INSTABILITY 383

Jeffreys theory applies only to the case of marginal stability; whereas, we are considering
the state of affairs when the criterion for stability given by that theory has been far surpassed.

We can now describe in general terms as to what will happen when, maintaining a con-
