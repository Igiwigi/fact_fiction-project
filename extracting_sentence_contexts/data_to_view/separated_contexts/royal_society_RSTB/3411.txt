It seems a very plausible hypothesis that the Palzeostachya type was
produced in response to a greater need of protecting the sporangia, and that at least
some of its cones also were pendulous.{]

Another feature that is noticeable in all cases is the very small size of the xylem
and often of the vascular bundle. Even in the larger leaves there are seldom more
than six or seven tracheides, and these have a very small diameter. Possibly this fact
indicates that the transpiration current was not large, but of course the leaves are
very small in size.

* Many shade-loving tropical plants have pendulous leaves, which are afforded protection against too
much transpiration or insolation by this means, ¢f. KEEBLE (’95).

+ Hick1ine (’08).

{ It must be admitted, however, that some of the impressions of Palwostachya which have been
figured do not support this view.
