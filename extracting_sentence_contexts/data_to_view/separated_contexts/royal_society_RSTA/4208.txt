Heisenberg begins his derivation by observing that ‘in quantum theory it has not been possible
to associate the electron with a point in space, considered as a function of time, by means of
observable quantities. However, even in quantum theory it is possible to ascribe to an electron
the emission of radiation’ ([32], p. 263; emphasis added). My emphasis reflects the fact that in
principle a measurement could associate an electron with a point in space, but not as a function
of time, as in classical mechanics. Heisenberg then says:

In order to characterize this radiation we first need the frequencies which appear as
functions of two variables. In quantum theory these functions are in the form:

v(n,n — w) =1/h{W(n) —W(n—a@)} (1)
and in classical theory in the form

v(n,a) =av(n)=a/h(dW/dn).  ([32], p. 263)


This difference, which reflects the QD principle, leads to a difference between classical and
quantum theories as concerns the combination relations for frequencies, which, in quantum
theory, correspond to the Rydberg-Ritz rules.
