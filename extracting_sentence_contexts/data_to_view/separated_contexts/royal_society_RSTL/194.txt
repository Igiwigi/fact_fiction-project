Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K. B. P.R.S.

Read May 14, 1801. MY DEAR SIR,

Tax cause of the ascent of the sap in trees appearing to me
not to have been satisfactorily accounted for, I have lately turned
my. attention to that subject; and, as some facts have come
under my observation, which do not appear to have been noticed
by any author that I have seen, I take the liberty to trouble you
with an account of a few of the experiments that I have made ;
hoping that some of them may appear new and interesting to
you. These experiments were made on different kinds of trees ;
but I shall confine myself to those made on the crab-tree, the
horse-chesnut, the vine, and the oak; and shall begin with
those made on the crab-tree. Choosing several young trees of this species in my nursery,
of something more than half an inch diameter, and of equal
vigour, I made two circular incisions through the bark, round
one half the number of them, about half an inch distant from
each other, early in the spring of 1799; and I totally removed
the bark between these incisions, scraping off the external coat
of the wood.
