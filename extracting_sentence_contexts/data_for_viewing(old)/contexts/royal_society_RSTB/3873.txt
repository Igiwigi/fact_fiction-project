8, 4, 5), its margin also grows irregularly into wavy folds (fig. 7: 8, 9, 10); with
sometimes a similar suggestion of two lateral lobes (fig. 7: 8), or at others several
quite irregular projections which may be confined to a definite group of cells. There
is no definite evidence whatever of two or four lobes symmetrically placed, or arising
as clean-grown protuberances, which might be expected if the structure were composed
of four carpels (LicNrer and Tison, 1912, p. 154). In subsequent stages the irregular
marginal growths become a definite fringe, in which individual marginal cells may
grow out into long papille ; this being particularly well seen in the case of buds 6 mm.
long, in which the integument just protrudes beyond the outer envelope (fig. 2).
Hypotheses built on the fact that lateral lobes of the compressed envelopes, both outer
and inner, are indicative of component leafâ€™ members of a presumably decussate system,
of which the median members have therefore been lost, are wholly speculative and
serve no useful purpose. Nothing can be gained by trying to force all facts into a

decussate scheme, in order to homologise the staminate and ovulate flowers : in fact a
much wider view of the possibilities of Welwitschia is gained when decussate con-
struction is entirely eliminated as a non-essential detail.

The archesporial cell is indicated at an early date, usually being recognisable from
the first. A similar archesporium in the apical growing point of the cone was found
