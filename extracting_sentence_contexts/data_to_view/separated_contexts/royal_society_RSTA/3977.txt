Therefore, this drop in wind speed is
probably related to the eclipse. Finally, electronic supplementary material, figure S11, shows the MSLP at IMO AWS for 0930
UTC (around the time of mid-eclipse) and the MSLP changes during the first and second halves of
the eclipse (0840-0940 and 0940-1040). Electronic supplementary material, figure S11a, does not
show a cyclonic-type circulation pattern anywhere over Iceland—in fact, it shows an anticyclonic
anomaly of approximately +1 hPa in central southern Iceland—and electronic supplementary
material, figure S11b, does not show any systematic decrease in MSLP during the first half of the
eclipse that might be related to a possible eclipse cyclone—indeed MSLP changes were generally
more positive during the first half of the eclipse (mean change 0.33 hPa) compared with the second
hour (mean change 0.06 hPa): this bias is especially evident in inland southern Iceland (electronic
supplementary material, figure S11).

Figure 11. Wind speed at Icelandic automatic weather stations between 0600 and 1200 UTC on 20 March 2015, encompassing the
solar eclipse period: (a) shows means of AWSs with different ranges of tx — tn temperature drops during the eclipse; (b) shows
individual AWSs where the temperature drop exceeded 2.0°C.
