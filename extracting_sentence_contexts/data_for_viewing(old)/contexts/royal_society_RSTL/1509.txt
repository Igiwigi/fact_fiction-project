likewise that space; where there is no appreciable quantity of
this 1matter, is capable of exhibiting electrical phenomena:
and, under this point of view, they are favourable to 'thevidea
of the phznomena« of electricity being produced by a highly
subtile fluid or fluids, of which the particles are repulsive,
with respect- to''-each other,-and attractive"of the particles
of other matter. On such an'abstruse” question, however,
there can be na,demonstrative evidence.” It maybe assumed,
as in the hypothesis of Hooks, Huycens, and EvLrx; that an
ethereal matter, susceptible- of electrical affections, fills all
space;-or that the positive and negative electrical 'states,
may increase' the force. of vapour from the  substances'in
which they exist;- and there is a fact in favour. of this last
idea which I have: often witnessed=—when the: voltaic' dis-
charge is made'in the Boylean'vacuum, either from platinum
or" charcoal, incontact with» mercury, the discharging sur-
faces require to be brought very near in the first instance;
but the electricity may be afterwards made to pass to'consi-
derable distances / through the- vapour ' generated from” the
mercury or charcoal by'its agency ;—and when two surfaces
of highly fixed metal, such as platinum or iron are used, the
discharge will pass only: through a very small distance, and
cannot be permanently kept up.

The circumstance, that the intensity of the electrical light
