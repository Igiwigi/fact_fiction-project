of black holes of size r and r’. Here we pursue the possibility that quantum physics is indeed
underpinned by some causal hidden-variable theory. Hence, let the decay of the radioactive atom
at t; be determined by the value of some hidden variable 4. Then, according to the discussion
above, the size of the black hole at fo < t; is both well defined (i.e. not a superposition of sizes)
and correlated with at t;. Instead of a radioactive atom decay, the release of the box could be
determined by an experimenter. In this case, the size of the black hole at fg will be the result of
experimenter decision at ty.

A physicist who believed that the size of the black hole at tp can be determined from the space—
time geometry in some neighbourhood of .#* at to would be faced with a dilemma. Somehow, :
the black hole would have to ‘know’ to be the right size at fo in order to anticipate the decay or =
non-decay of the atom, or alternatively the experimenter decision, at t;. The apparent dilemma 3
is compounded by the fact that the photons which propagate on .#* never interact with the
radioactive atom (or experimenter) at f;. To avoid requiring some implausible conspiracy, the nee)
physicist may conclude that there may be a retrocausal effect by which information, associated :
with the decay of the radioactive atom, propagates back in time causing the black hole event [4
horizon to expand at earlier times. DN

However, in this case, there is a simple explanation for the correlation which requires neither [sz
conspiracy nor retrocausality. The explanation lies in the fact that #+ is defined by a global :&
property of space-time, it being the boundary of null surfaces that escape to .%*. Consistent .
with this, the location r(to) of #* cannot be determined by the geometry of space-time in
the neighbourhood of * at fo. Hence, the correlation is explainable without conspiracy or
retrocausality.
