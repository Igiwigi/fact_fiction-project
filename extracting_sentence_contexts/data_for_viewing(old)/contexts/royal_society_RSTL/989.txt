ferent species, and even of different genera, no sensible diffe-
rence existed in the vessels, which appeared to diverge into
the bark of the stock, from these buds and from those repro-
duced in the preceding experiments.

It appears, therefore, probable, that a pulpous organisable
mass first derives its matter either from the bark, or the
alburnum ; and that this matter subsequently forms the new
layer of bark ; for, if the vessels had proceeded, as radicles,-
from the inserted buds, ar grafts, such vessels would have
been, in some degree, different from the natural vessels of the
bark of the stocks; and it does not appear probable, even
without referring to the preceding facts, that vessels should
be extended, in a few days, by parts successively added to their

* The advantages, which may be obtained by pruning timber trees judiciously,
appear to be very little known, I have endeayoured to ascertain the practicability of
giving to trees such forms as will render their timber more adyantageously conver-
tible to naval or other purposes. The $uccess of the experiments, on small trees has
been complete, and the revults perfectly consistent, in eyery case, with the theory I
have endeavoured to support in former memoirs ; and I am confident, that by appro-
priate management, the trunks and branches of growing trees may be moulded into
the various forms best adapted to the use of the $ship-builder; and that the growth of
the trees may at the same time be rendered considerably more rapid, without any
expense or temporary loss to the proprietor,
