node xz=E(m—a/ n*—2) corresponds to cos 8=1(m+4/n*—2),

where (m being >4/2) the point (cos, 8in 9) is a real point on the circle a*+3*=1 80
long as m is not >3, that is, from m=+x+/2 to m=4Z; but if m>4, then the point in
question is an imaginary point on the circle—whence also the node a=Um—a/m*—2)
is an acnode or isolated point.

In the case m=4 we have

node z=1 corresponding to cos {=4 or 9=60',
MT=y > cos 6=1 or 6=0?,
the last-mentioned point z=+ being in fact the point of union of two cusps in the case
m=3 now in question. Hence in this case we have at (7=+, y=0) a triple point equi-
valent to two cusps and a node; visibly, there is only a single branch cutting the axis
of © at right angles.

In the case m=x 2, the nodes coincide as above mentioned at the point 4=275 On

the axis; for this value of mz the coordinates of the cusps are
