The labio-lingual breadth is less than in the male or
female chimpanzee, the female orang-outang, and the male gorilla, but only its deviations
from the male gorilla and male orang-outang are significant at a level of P<0-02. Senyurek (1941) claims that the upper lateral incisor of Plesianthropus is smaller than that
of the living apes, and that in the extent of its reduction, it parallels later stages of human
evolution. In view of the facts revealed by the present study, his first statement seems to
have no foundation. The upper lateral incisor of Plesianthropus is not significantly smaller
than that of the modern female gorilla, and very little, if at all, smaller than the female
orang-outang. Upper canine.
