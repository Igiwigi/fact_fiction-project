diffusing metallic molecules is not much reduced by heat, and it may be that
molecules of the diffusing substance are not so liable to disruption by a rise j
temperature.

It may be well to wait until more results have been obtained before attempting

A few general deductions may, however, be drawn.

It will be seen that gold diffuses more rapidly in bismuth and in tin than it does
in the heavier metal lead. It has also been observed (though Table E does not
embody the results) that platinum diffuses faster in bismuth than in lead. t
diffusion of platinum and of gold is increased in about equal ratio by the sub-
stitution of bismuth for lead as a solvent. On the other hand, platinum diffuses
much more slowly in lead than gold does, although their atomic weights and their
