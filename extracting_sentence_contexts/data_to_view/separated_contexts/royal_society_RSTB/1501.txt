Again, if, in stimulating any given posterior lumbar root, movement resulted in
the lower limb, one or more of the anterior lumbar roots were then divided in various
sequences, with the result that certain differences of movement could be observed. For instance, in one experiment excitation of the 6th posterior lumbar root gave
flexion of the hip, knee, ankle, and toes, contraction of the dorsal muscles of the
spine, and lateral movement in the tail to the same side; then, on dividing the
anterior root of the 4th, of the 5th, and of the 6th lumbar nerves successively, the
movements still obtained on the excitation of the 6th lumbar posterior root were
apparently exactly the same as before the section of the anterior roots. The same
fact was borne out by the following experiment in the opposite direction, viz., by
dividing the roots from below upwards. In this experiment excitation of the 5th
posterior lumbar root gave flexion of the hip, knee, ankle, and toes, and contraction
of the dorsal muscles of the spine. The Ist sacral anterior root was then divided,
and on stimulating the 5th posterior root as before the movements resulting were
flexion of the hip and knee and dorsal muscles, but the flexion of the ankle was less
than before, and the flexion of the toes was obliterated.
