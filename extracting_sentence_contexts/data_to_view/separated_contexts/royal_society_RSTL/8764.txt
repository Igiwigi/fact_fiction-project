In the case
of Sarsia the alternations between periods of rapid swimming and periods of complete
repose are much more marked than in Aurelia aurita, to which Dr. Finer's tables refer ;
and I am sure that with them the rule in question can only apply in a very general
way. It is to be observed that Dr. Enizr himself does not appear to place much
reliance on particular applications of this rule. I am able to confirm Dr. Enizr's statements as to the various ways in which the
lithoeysts discharge their influence relatively to one another, and would only add the
curious fact that very frequently one or more of the eight lithocysts appears to be tem-
porarily or permanently prepotent over the othersâ€”the contractions always originating
in it for a great number of times in succession. Mere observation with the eye, however, is not sufficient to determine the interesting
question as to whether or not there is any further coordination between the lithocysts
than is brought about by the rapid passage of contractile waves from one to the other. I have accordingly made a large number of variously devised sections with the view
of answering this question ; but it would occupy too much space to detail them at
present.
