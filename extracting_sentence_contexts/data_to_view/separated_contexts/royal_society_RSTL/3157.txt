At the period above



216 MR. BARLOW ON THE ERRORS IN THE COURSE

alluded to, iron ballast and iron tanks were perhaps scarcely known ; now we
have, besides these, iron knees, iron cables, and above all iron capstans, besides
various other articles of the same material, which together form such an
attracting mass, that if we cannot allow that there was no local attraction
forty years back, we must at least admit that it was certainly then yery incon-
sideraþhle to what it is at present, and that navigation by compass was at that
time comparatively on equal terms with nautical astronomy ; but since that
period, the errors of the one have been gradually removed by improvements in
instruments, the introduction of chronometers, and the correction of astro-
nomical tables and data, whereas the compass $till remains the same uncouth
machine, and the disturbing forces to which it is exposed have been increased
in, perhaps, a fourfold proportion. At all events the disturbing force is now
considerable, and the deflection it canses in the needle, under some cireum-
stances, very great; and as this effect is perpetually varying as the course of the
vessel is changed, as it is also as she changes her latitude, though the course
should remain the same, a constant attention to the amount of this error seems
to be indispensable, at least in those circumstances where the whole safety of
the vessel is dependent on the certainty of the courses steered, which is in fact
always the case in a dark night, and when land is near. It is almost impossible to give a very popular idea of the direction and
amount of this deflecting force. It may however be stated, that in this lati-
tude, and in all those northern latitudes where the dip is considerable, the
greatest deflections take place, on an east or on a west course, diminishing
both ways to the north and south, where it vanishes ; and in all these cases the
direction of the deflection is always to the right or left of a person, looking
forward in the vessel, accordingly as the course of the vessel is to the right or
left, that is to the east or west of the meridian, and it is exactly the reyerse in
a high southern latitude or with a consideraþble southern dip.
