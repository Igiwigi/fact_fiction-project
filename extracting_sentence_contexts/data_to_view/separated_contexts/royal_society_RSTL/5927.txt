By making 2 successively 1, 2, 3, up to any number less than the number
of years of age within which 7 remains constant, the number 7, being known, the
number living at any other age within that range will be obtained by multiplying 7, by
the corresponding value of y. Thus, if 2, is the value of y when z=10 in equation (6.);
then putting 7,, for the numbers living at the age 20, the living at the age 30 will be
