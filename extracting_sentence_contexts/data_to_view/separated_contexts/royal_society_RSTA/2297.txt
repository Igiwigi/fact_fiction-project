It is easy to see that the ¢;’s agree locally. Indeed, both 0 and 1 are valid assignments for a single
variable, which is the most two valuations can have in common. On the other hand, the fact that
the liar cycle gives rise to a paradox means that the valuations do not agree globally. Indeed, a
global assignment of truth values to each s1,...,S; consistent with formulae (3.3) is impossible,
as they collectively yield s1 <> -s1.

4. Non-locality and contextuality

We shall now expose a surprising connection between the valuation algebraic theory of
disagreement with a completely different topic, namely the study of non-locality and
contextuality in quantum foundations.
