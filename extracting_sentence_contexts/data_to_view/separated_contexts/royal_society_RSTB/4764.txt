A minimum of damage occurs in October 0-10 (0-7 per cent.),
followed by a winter maximum 0-64 (4:4 per cent.), and by a nearly stationary period
from April to July at 0-42 (2-9 per cent.). The winter effect is smaller both absolutely
and relatively than that of plot 6, but if it be admitted that the importance of winter
rain lies largely in the washing out of nitrates, the evidence for considerable, though no
doubt variable, residues in the alternating series is unmistakable. The fact that the
alternating series has not given an appreciable higher yield than that of plot 5, must be
ascribed to soil heterogeneity, which has approximately balanced the advantage of the
residual nitrogen. That such soil heterogeneity exists in this field may be shown by
a comparison of 2a with the adjacent plot 2b. These have received the same manure
since 1885, but during the present century 2a has ceased to gain in yield upon 2b, but yields
very regularly on the average 2 bushels less than the adjacent plot.
