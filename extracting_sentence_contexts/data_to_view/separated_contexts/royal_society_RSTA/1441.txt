of the future in the field of construction, with spectacular buildings already realized, such as the
Mjestarnet tower in Norway, at 85.4m the highest timber construction worldwide (figure 2b) and
many impressive wooden skyscrapers in the planning stage, showing the potential of wood in
multi-storey building [28,29].

(i) Wood protection

The protection of wood elements against humidity, fungi, UV or fire is crucial for the design of
wood buildings and structures. For both indoor and outdoor uses, surface coatings are often used
to protect wood. Aside from the fact that such coatings are mostly derived from fossil-based
synthetic polymers, they themselves age and degrade over time and they must be reapplied
periodically. A more durable approach to wood protection is to impregnate the material with
a compound whose role is to slow down or supress the wood degradations caused by external
factors. With this type of modification, the wood material has a ‘built-in’ protection.
