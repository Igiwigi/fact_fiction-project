More generally, if we consider a semi-infinite aerofoil, with cross-section given by

the pressure at a point on its surface within the Mach triangle from the leading corner O
can be written in the form

ae = ei cos"! (F)- =|, ot = n”(£) a, (53)

p z} malo

where Af, is used to denote the two-dimensional value of the excess pressure. It is easy to demonstrate from (53), as was shown by Lighthill by other means, that, for
symmetrical rectangular wings of aspect ratio greater than 1/, there is no induced drag at
zero incidence. If the aerofoil is of chord c, then the decrement of drag due to the pressure
defect (53) may be written

hia (ae iat ‘ ACE, rz—ox a8
AD =f (z) def a \n (0) cos = i cos~ aan n(G ae

Introducing ex/z = ¢ in the first integral, and ax/(z—¢) = o in the second, we find

ADS =), cos! edo| f1'(2) dz (n'(0) +f9"© (2-0) de}
= =a," odo { 1'(2) az)" =

The result depends essentially on the fact that the excess pressure given in (51) is of the
cone-field type depending not on the distance of the point of measurement from the corner,
but on its angular position with reference to it. It will cease to hold when the aspect ratio is
less than 1/z. Some calculations have been made for this case, and it is found, for example,
that for a double-wedge aerofoil, aspect ratio 1/2, the drag is about two-thirds of that given
by the two-dimensional theory.
