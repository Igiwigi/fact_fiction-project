a It is seen by the last equation that the effect of radiation to or from the surface of
he ball is completely eliminated since the coefticient of emission is numerically equal

ho the coefficient of absorption for the same difference of temperatures. It therefore
fortunately does not matter how the surface of the ball becomes changed, so long as
& remains the same during the half hour of the experiment. As a matter of fact,
‘uring the soldering process the surface becomes very much tarnished.
