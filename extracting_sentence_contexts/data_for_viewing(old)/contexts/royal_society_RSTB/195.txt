8 We will next consider the results which we have obtained from destruction. of: the
‘Ss angular gyrus. This convolution has attracted a great amount of attention from,
‘2 others as well as ourselves, because it is the part of the brain which was originally
é believed by Frrrter to be exclusively concerned with the appreciation, of visnal
= impressions derived from the opposite eye; and, although this position is somewhat
modified in the later edition of his book, it is still regarded as a most important part
‘© of the cerebral visual centre, viz., as connected with the appreciation of those visual
‘3 impressions which affect the yellow spot or centre of direct vision. When examined:
fe into, it will, however, be found that this opinion rests mainly upon the fact that a
very temporary visual disturbance may follow its destruction or injury. Certainly.
we have ourselves in one or two cases obtained this result, nor is it to be wondered at.
if we accept the conclusion that the adjacent occipital lobe is the real cerebral visual
~ centre.

For the eftect of operating upon the angular gyrus may, and sometimes does,
produce such a temporary disturbance in the adjoining occipital lobe as to depress the.
functions of this, or even temporarily to abolish them. The same result is often, got
by operating on the temporal lobe. But the symptoms are not permanent and may:
