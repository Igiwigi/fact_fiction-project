I viewed the same nebula with a y-feet
reflector.

« It is large, but very faint. With 120, it seems to be com-
«« posed of stars, and I think I see several of them; but it will
« bear no magnifying power.”

In this experiment, magnifying power was evidently injurious
to penetrating power. I do not account for this upon the principle
that by magnifying we make an object less bright ; for, when
opticians have also demonstrated that brightness is diminished
by magnifying, it must again be understood as relating only to
the mtrinsic brightness of the magnified picture; its absolute
brightness, which is the only one that concerns us at present,
must always remain the same.* The real explanation of the
fact, I take to be, that while the light collected is employed in
magnifying the object, it cannot be exerted in giving penetrating
power.

® This may be proved thus. The mean intrinsic brightness, or rather illumination,
of a point of the picture on the retina, will be all the light that falls on the picture,
divided by the number of its points; or C = F Now, since with a greater magni-

fying power m, the number of points N increases as the squares of the power, the

expression for the intrinsic brightness -, will decrease in the same ratio; and it will

consequently be in general N ox m?, and Fe C x _ that is, by compounding
