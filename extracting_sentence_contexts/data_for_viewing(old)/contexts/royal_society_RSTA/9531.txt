Diagram 6, figs. 1 to 4, is more compact when the displacements are assumed to depend
upon a high value of the wave-length. The group might be more compact still if an

adequate correction could be applied to the measurement of the lines in the neighbour-
hood of \ = 4300 to 4400, which appear abnormally high in the diagram, and there is
little doubt that the readings are in fact rather too large. It has been stated that
for the sake of uniformity Mr. Prarsr’s readings have been used almost exclusively
in preparing the tables, my own readings of the lines serving as a check upon them.
The check readings in this region indicate that the measurements of the lines in
region 4800 to 4900 are to those in region 4400 as 5 is to 4. This would improve
Diagram 4, and also make the second group in Diagram 6, fig. 4, more compact by
reducing the displacements of lines 160, 167, 172, 174 and 176.

The above argument is based upon the resolution of the nickel spectrum into only two
groups, but reasons will be given in the next section for distinguishing between three
groups. If this is the case we must consider whether the isolated lines between the
two main groups could form a group by themselves. If the displacement varies with
the square of the wave-length, Diagram 6, fig. 3, indicates that the following lines
