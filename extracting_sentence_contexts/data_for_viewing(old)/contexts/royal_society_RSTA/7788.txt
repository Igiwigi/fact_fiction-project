TION OF OBSERVATIONS

D COMBI

LAW OF ERROR /

In neither case do the probabilities of one observation falling in a particular range
differ by more than 0-012. To see what this means with regard to testing the normal
law, let us suppose that n observations are made and that we are given only the totals
by ranges to compare by the y? test with the postulate that they are derived from the
normal law; and that in fact they are derived from a binomial law with three com-
ponents, According to the usual rule for applying the test when some of the expectations
are small, the terminal groups cannot be taken separately until the expectations in
them, according to the hypothesis to be tested, reach 5. Until this happens they will
be combined with the adjacent groups before y* is evaluated, Thus they will not appear
separately in the test until x reaches 8 x 5/0-084 = about 480. Until then the expecta-
tions, for given , will be

<- -1 +1
Binomial O-125n O-37in O-375n
Normal O-124n 0:376n O-376n

Now if the actual frequencies agreed exactly with the binomial expectations we should
