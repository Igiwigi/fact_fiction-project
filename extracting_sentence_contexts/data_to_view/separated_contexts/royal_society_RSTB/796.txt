This is not due to any rise of
pressure in the large veins, for, as will presently be pointed out, the venous pressure

the tonus of the relaxed auricular wall. This change in the elasticity of the uncon-
tracted auricular wall has no direct connection with the increase in force of the
auricular contraction. They do not increase and diminish together, as is shown by
the fact that the changes in the outline of the lower, or diastolic, margin of the curve,
do not follow the same course as the changes in outline of the upper or systolic margin
of the curve. ‘This is even better shown in the auricular tracing of Fig. 15. In some
cases, the change in the elasticity of the relaxed auricle which usually results
from augmentor excitation is absent, or is so slightly marked as to be barely
appreciable, while the increased force of the auricular contractions is very markedly
