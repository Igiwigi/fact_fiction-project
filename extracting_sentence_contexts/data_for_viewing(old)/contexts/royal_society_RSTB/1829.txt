up as in other genera. It may be noted in passing, that the vascular bundle upon
which the sorus is seated throws up an irregular extension into the base of the sorus,
in the form of tracheids (fig. 42), the physiological importance of which is obvious
enough.

Turning now to the sporogenous tissue, it undergoes subdivision in the usual way,
till the definitive number of spore-mother cells is attained ; these then separate from
one another, and round themselves off in the fluid which fills the enlarged cavity of
the sporangium. Then follows the tetrad division, all the cells of the sporogenous
mass taking part in it in normal sporangia. A tapetum is meanwhile formed from
the cells adjoining the sporogenous group, and these may grow and assume irregular
form, encroaching on the cavity, as in the case of Danea. In fact all the main
features are the same as in other Marattiacez.

As in other genera, an estimate has been made of the average number of spores
which may be produced from a normal sporangium of Kaulfussia. An average
number of spore-mother-cells exposed in a single vertical section of a sporangium,
radially through the sorus, is found to be 245; transverse or tangential sections
show that the whole sporogenous mass is about eight layers in thickness; the total
number of spore-mother-cells would therefore be about 1960, and the potential
number of spores per sporangium ahout 1960 x 4 = 7840.

As regards the septa dividing the loculi, variations in thickness, and even partial
septations have been seen. The usual thickness of the septum is of three layers of
