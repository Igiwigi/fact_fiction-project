upwards by the force of the explosion. An infusion of violets
was tinged green when admitted to the electrified gas; but the
change of colour did not occur instantly, as happens from the
absorption of ammoniacal gas ; and required for its production
that the liquid should be brought extensively into contact with
the inner surface of the tube. From this effect on a blue ve-
getable colour, we may infer that/the precipitate was an alka-
line substance, and probably the carbonate of ammoniac ; but
the quantity was much too minute to be the subject of more
decisive experiment.

I shall conclude this memoir, with a brief summary of the
facts that are establiched by the preceding experiments. *
Those included under the first head are deducible from the
experiments of Dr. AusTIN.'

* Since this paper was written I have extended the inquiry to phosphorated hydro-
genous gas, which expands equally with the carbonated hydrogen ; loses its property of
inflaming when brought into contact with oxygenous gas; and affords evident traceÂ«
of a production of phosphorous or phosphoric acid.
