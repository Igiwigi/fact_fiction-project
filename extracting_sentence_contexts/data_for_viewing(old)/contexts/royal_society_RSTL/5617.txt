PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE EQUATION OF LAPLACE'S FUNCTIONS, ETC. 55

or, reducing as before, and observing that 7; is equivalent to

(ﬆin 0) (F) (m9),
we have, finally,

«,=(5in0)-"(5in045n0)" (sn0(4) (5n0)*(c2; ON = AK - (34)

If in this expression we put 0 for the result of all but one of the operations indicated in
the last term, we reproduce the form (21.) obtained in art. 9, which appears in fact to
be always complete. The form (34.), however, as before remarked, will never contain
superfluous constants.

20. It is an interesting question whether the forms thus obtained on the supposition
that # is an integer, are not really general, inasmuch as they are expressible without
reference to that supposition. I believe that they are; but I doubt whether, in the
existing state of analysis, it can be proved either that they are or are not (sﬆe { IV.).

21. It is easy to obtain other forms analogous to those given in the preceding articles,
containing inverse in place of direct operations. But such forms are objectionable,
because they necessarily give rise to superfluous constants, the discrimination of which
may be a matter of difficulty.
