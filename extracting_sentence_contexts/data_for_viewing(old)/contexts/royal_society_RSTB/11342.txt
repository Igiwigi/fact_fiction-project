clear picture of the disease risks this activity imposes on wild-
life and humans remains elusive [81]. The intentional feeding
of charismatic mammals is common and probably alters dis-
ease risk as well. For example, provisioning of wild primates
is prevalent within the context of Hindu and Buddhist cul-
ture, and has been enhanced with increasing tourism [102].
Motivations for feeding wildlife are complex and may vary
regionally [103,104], but numerous studies have shown a
key impetus of the psychological benefits of direct human—
wildlife interaction [105], including a sense of pleasure or
relaxation, feelings of usefulness and an increased connection
to nature [106-109]. In fact, the vast majority of people sur-
veyed about their willingness to interact with wild primates
were aware of the potential disease risks associated with
this interaction, and yet more than half still responded that
they would touch wild primates if given the opportunity
[110]. Welfare motivations are also commonly cited by
those who provision wildlife [108], including a desire to
help wildlife or ‘assist them through hard times’ [107,109].
Indeed, provisioning tends to be strongest in seasons when
natural food is perceived to be limited [107], suggesting a
strong role of welfare motivations.

Cox & Gaston [100] suggest that positive reactions from
