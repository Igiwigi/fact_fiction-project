and disaster recovery. DR
The literature quantifying the extent of potential loss and damage is slim. But the assessments : re
we have are jaw-dropping. Martin Parry and his colleagues put the mean cost of residual loss :m
between 2000 and 2200 at US$275 trillion [4]. A report prepared for the UN Economic Commission a
for Africa found that loss and damage in Africa could reduce gross domestic product in many 1s
_o

sectors between 1% and 5% (based on warming scenarios of 2 to more than 4°C) [5]. According to
Parry, it is possible that loss and damage will account for two-thirds of all climate-change impacts
[4].

Because loss and damage are defined by the limitations of mitigation and adaptation, one
obvious way to address the problem—in lieu of after-the-fact repair or compensation—is to
extend the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation so as to avoid extensive harm before
it happens [3]. This is why knowing the practical differences between a world with 1.5°C
of warming and one with 2°C of warming is so important to understanding the practical
effectiveness of the loss-and-damage project.

3. Loss-and-damage policy

(a) History and shape

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) addresses loss and damage
through the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, now incorporated into
Article 8 of the Paris Agreement. Understanding the debate behind the Warsaw Mechanism
