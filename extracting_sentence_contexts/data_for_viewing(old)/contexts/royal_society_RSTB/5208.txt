junction of the so-called pedicular process or pedicle with the basipterygoid process
of the trabecular cartilage. Gaupr (1906) and SwrynerTon (1902) compare this
articulation with the orbital or palatobasal articulation of Selachians, and regard the
condition in Lepidosteus as a primitive one. I agree with Verr (1911), Recan,* and
others, however, in regarding this articulation as quite secondary, and believe that it
has been acquired solely to relieve the strain on the suspensorial apparatus brought
about. by the great increase in size and length of the lower jaw in this fish. The
articulation of the orbital process of the palatoquadrate with the cranium is established
at an early stage in Selachians, whereas this palatobasal articulation of Lepidosteus is
acquired comparatively late in the ontogeny. The so-called pedicular process of
Amia and certain of the lower Teleosts, which is compared by SwinnERTON with the
process of the same name in Lepidosteus, also develops at a comparatively late stage
(of. figs. 52, 54). The same author lays great stress on the fact that the metapterygoid
region of the palatoquadrate cartilage becomes progressively reduced as we pass from
the lower Teleosts to the more specialized forms, but this reduction seems to be connected
