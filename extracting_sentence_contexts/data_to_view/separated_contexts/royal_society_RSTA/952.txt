The only difference is the development of the well-formed crystals, which
are not flat and do not present a (111) face. The resolution was not great enough to
enable the outline to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of the
crystals was never in focus at the same time as the lower part pointed to considerable
thickness, and added to the difficulty of determining their habit and orientation. Another way of investigating the effect of mercury contaminations is to heat the
film before these spontaneous changes have taken place. A silver film, showing
yellow spots, prepared in exactly the same circumstances as the one whose behaviour
