this second apparatus to obviate the necessity of very accurate measurement of the
coil-temperature by using one of the new alloys of very small temperature-coefticient,
manganine being the one chosen. The expediency of this change was subsequently
emphasised by the fact that we found it was inadvisable to artificially heat the room
at Breteuil in which the comparisons were made, on account of the uncertainties

attending the measurement of the temperatures of the various mercury columns
of the gas thermometer. During the year and a-half the experiments lasted, the
room temperature varied from about 4° to 23°, which would have rendered accurate
artificial control of the box-temperature extremely difficult.

Since in the first resistance-box the thermoelectric effects between the various
wires and terminals in the circuit (in which several different metals are used) were
