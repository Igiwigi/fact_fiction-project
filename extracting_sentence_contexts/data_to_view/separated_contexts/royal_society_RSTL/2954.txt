A strong con-
firmation of the foregoing opinion is obtained from a compa-
rison of this part of the anatomy of the mole-cricket, with
that of the corresponding part in the ostrich ; the stomach of
which bird, acting like a gizzard by means of numerous peb-
bles which it takes into that organ, is aided by two enormous
exzca, which, though they are not immediately in contact

with the stomach, are not far removed from it ; and like the
stomach, contain numerous pebbles, which are both smaller
and smoother than those of the stomach itself, as being only
destined to act on food already partially digested. The ana-
logy on which I have just insisted, is strengthened by the
fact, that there are very large duplicatures' of the internal
coat of the cazca of the ostrich, as in the corresponding parts
of the mole-cricket, I either therefore misunderstand, or can-
not agree with M. MARCEL DE SERREs, the author of a yery
interesting paper on the Intestinal Canal of Insects, published
in the 76th vol. of the Journal de Physique ; who seems to
attribute to the ca above described, the office of an hepatic
organ, and calls them © Varsseauz hepatiques superieures,” in
contradistinction to another organ situated lower down in
the intestines, and acknowledged by all to be of an hepatic
character. From the common base of the two caca a very narrow
but powerfully muscular tube, which might with much pro-
priety ,be called the jejunum, passes onwards for a very
Short space, and terminates in a large intestine ;*this intes-
tine, which is eight or ten times the diameter of the jejunum,
contracts very gradually as it proceeds, till, near the extre-
mity of the rectum it swells out very considerably.
