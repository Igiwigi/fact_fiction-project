A frequently
observed pattern across vertebrates, characterized by caring females and compet-
ing males, has been referred to as ‘conventional’ sex roles. These widespread sex
differences in behaviour have ultimately been traced back to differences in gamete
size, i.e. anisogamy [3,4], but exactly how anisogamy shapes sex roles has recently
been questioned [5]. However, denying any effects of anisogamy for sex roles, and
attributing all observed variability among species to chance and idiosyncratic,
environment-driven factors [6,7] or doubting the existence of sex roles altogether
[8-10], are positions that cannot be easily reconciled with the fact that sexually
