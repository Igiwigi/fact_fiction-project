same extent as for funerals of neighbours, attendance rates
again decreased with higher economic development. These
data suggest that economic development may liberate indi-
viduals from the funeral-related responsibilities they might
have had as members of a more traditional local
community or extended family (figure 3).


adopted disposal practices that distance the living from the
dead. For example, the practice of abandonment, which
allows people to witness the tearing up and devouring of a
body by birds or animals and the process of decay, reinforces
the fact that humans are merely part of nature. However, if
the body is buried underground, the process by which it is
returned to nature is concealed from sight. Further, cremation
might be considered as artificially camouflaging the
process entirely by instantly returning the body to inorganic
substances. In other words, more modern human interven-
tions in the process of returning the body to nature
increasingly shield us from ‘the smell of death’ [22]. The
more culture develops, the more people conceal the reality
of death.
