However, there is no
doubt that ferric oxalate, and the yttria salt, did coexist in the same s0lution ; yet
in order to prove that no oxalate of yttria was present along with them, it would he
necessary to show that the salt in question is not dissolved by any of the other sub-
stances present in the mixture. Now it is by no means insoluble in either hydro-
chloric or acetic acid, and the conditions of the experiment require the acid to he
in slight excess. Thus the experiment merely shows that oxalic acid left free to act
on the ferric and the yttria salts, will combine with the former oxide in very much
the larger proportion; a fact which is in perfect consonance with the strong affinity
between that acid and the sesquioxide of iron, which has been previously remarked
in this paper. It is then a law, without a single known exception, that if AB, CD, EF, &e., by
any interchange of bases and acids can possibly produce an insoluble substance, that
insoluble compound does actually make its appearance. 'This seems to me almost
conclusiye evidence that the interchange always takes place originally to a greater or
less degree ; for I cannot believe, with one chemist of high repute, that * when bodies
are brought into intimate contact, all the forces which exist, not only in themselves,
but in all their possible compounds, are called into action at the same time,” unless
indeed it be by these compounds being actually formed. The following experiments may illustrate more fully the truth of the explanation
of complete precipitation which has been given above.
