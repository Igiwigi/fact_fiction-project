(b) References to Previous Theories.—The results obtained in the last section
suggest considerations which may tend to a great simplification of our ideas in
reference to the internal friction of fluids. Hitherto, very diverse theories have been
advanced in order to account for the apparent anomalies in the viscosity of liquids,
and various general formule have been proposed in order to express the experimental

facts. ARRHENIUS proposed a formula of the form » = 0” (‘ Zeit. f. Phys. Chem.,’ 1,
285, 1887) to express the viscosity of a solution in terms of the concentration.
