at considerably higher temperatures, when a good deal of the primary has itself been
dissolved. The skeleton crystals of the solid phase must form a sufficiently rigid
framework to prevent the breaking of the bar, or even the pull-out, although they are
surrounded by liquid. From the nature of the equilibrium in the region between the
solidus and the liquidus it is quite conceivable that the rigid scaffolding might become
more infusible by the draining away of the liquid from the bars. Thus the
temperature we were measuring was necessarily indefinite, but depended more on the
melting-point of the solid phase than on the commencement of liquefaction.

The experiments failed to throw any light on the position of the solidus, but they
have proved that the skeletons of the solid phase are, even at the temperatures
between the solidus and the liquidus, rigid structures and not plastic masses. This
fact, together with the photographs which indicate when the solid phase fills the
ingot, entitles us to say that below the solidus Ablemdef, as drawn by us, the alloys,
though they may be at a bright red heat, are rigid solids. Hence any erystallisations
taking place below the solidus occur in an already solid and crystalline body.
