black oxide of manganese, but could not succeed.

There is, however, a still more extraordinary formation of this
acid, in the distillation of nitro-muriatic acid upon platina. Oxy-
gen is absorbed by the metal ; yet, not only oxygenized, but also
hyperoxygenized muriatic acid is formed. I have repeated the
experiment several times; and am well convinced of the fact,
however contrary to theory it may appear. I have tried the
action of oxygenized muriatic acid upon nitric acid, in the hopes
of forming hyperoxygenized muriatic acid; but there was no
action to this effect among their elements.

The fact of the production of a peculiar gas, by the distilla-


upon oxygenized and hbyperoxygentzed muriatic Acid, &c. 165

tion of nitro-muriatic acid upon platina, has been observed by
Mr. Davy, in his Researches.* But, as hyperoxygenized muriatic
acid was not known at that time, he coul1 not say the real
nature of that gas. Had Mr. Davy carried his ingenious expe-
riments a little farther, we should have been much earlier
acquaiated with the last degree of oxygenizement of muriatic
acid.
