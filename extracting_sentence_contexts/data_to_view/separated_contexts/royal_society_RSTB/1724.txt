2. That these roots are identical with the fossil previously described as Kalowylon
Hookeri. We will first state the facts which prove that the appendages are morphologically
roots. Adventitious roots, with the rarest exceptions, are of endogenous origin ; they arise
from deep-seated tissues (pericycle or endodermis), and have to grow out through the
cortex of the parent stem. Hence they are readily distinguished from stem-branches,
which are almost always of exogenous origin, arising from superficial tissues.
