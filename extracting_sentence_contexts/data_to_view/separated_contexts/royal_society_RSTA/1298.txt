Prior to 1819 when his metal-
lurgical researches commenced, his other contributions to knowledge were represented
by comparatively short communications to the Royal Society, the Royal Institution
and other bodies. So far as the author is aware, there had not previously been any
researches by Farapay of an extensive nature such as the one now described on “ Steel
and Alloys,” which was carried on for more than five years. The problem which presented itself to the author for solution was no easy one ; in
fact, it was full of difficulties and pitfalls. At first it seemed almost hopeless to obtain
much definite information from seventy-nine specimens of metal and of which only
thirteen weighed 100 grams (3} oz.) or over—the heaviest 140-10 grams (5 0z.)—while
the remaining sixty-six averaged only 31 grams (1-10 oz.) each. Beyond a few special
marks on some of the specimens—these are described in Table I, giving the particulars of
the specimens arranged in their groups—there was practically nothing to indicate their
actual nature, the probable composition, how made and treated, or other data.
