and I am induced to mention it, because this substance is
very likely to be employed as a test of the correctness of
such a goniometer, by any one who is not convinced of its
accuracy from a distinct conception of the principles of its
construction.
The inclination of the surfaces of a primitive crystal of car-
bonate of lime is stated, with great appearance of precision, to
be 104? 28' 40‚Äù: a result deduced from the supposed position
of its axis at an angle of 45* with each of the surfaces, and
from other seducing circumstances. of apparent harmony by
simple ratios. But however strong the presumption might
be that this angle, which by measurement approaches to 45", is
actually s0, it must nevertheless be in fact about 459 20'; for
I find the inclination of the surfaces to each other is very
nearly, if not accurately 1039, as it was formerly determined



reflective Gontometer. 257

to be by HuyGExs;* and since the measure of the superficial
angle given by Sir Isaac NewTox | corresponds with this
determination of HuyGExs, his evidence may be considered
as a further confirmation of the same result ; for it may be
presumed, that he would not adopt the measures of others,
