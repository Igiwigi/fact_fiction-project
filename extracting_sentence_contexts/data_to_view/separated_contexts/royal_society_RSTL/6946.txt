as if, supposing a number of dogs to be making a point in the same
field, the existence could be assumed of as many birds as pointers. (4) Mr. AzcnrBary Swire has obligingly called my attention to Warixe's treatment/of the question of Nzw-
Tox's rule in the © Meditationes Analytice,” On superficial examination the reader might be induced to suppose
that in part 9, p. 68, ed. 1782, WarixG had deduced a proof of the rule from the preceding propositions ; but on

looking into the case will find that there is not the slightest vestige of proof, the rule being stated, but without
any demonstration whatever being either adduced or alleged. In fact, on turning to the preface of this (the
last) edition of the © Meditationes,” the reader will find at p. 11 an explicit ayowal of the demonstration being
wanting, After referring in order to Caxmeprra/s, Maciavrix's, and Nawrox's rules, as well 'as his own, for
discovering the existence of impossible roots, he adds these words: * At omnes he regule predict perraro invenerunt yerum numerum imposstbilium radicum in ewquationibus
multarum dimensionum et ad/uc demonstratione egent ; yulgares enim demonstrationes 8olummodo probant impos-
8hiles radices in data zquatione contineri, non yero quod 8altem tot sunt quot invenit regula.”

« Vera resolutio problematis est perdifficilis et yalde laboriosa;; cognitum est radices ex Possibilitate per
=qualitatem transire ad impossibilitatem ; ergo in ;generali resolutione hujusce problematis necesse /est inyenire
casum in quo radices date wquationis eyadunt aquales; resolutio autem hujus casus yalde laboriosa est; et
consequenter resolutio generalis predicti problematis magis erit laboriosa,”

Written in Latin, and when the proper language of algebra was yet unformed, it is frequently a work of
much labour to follow Warrx6's demonstrations and deductions, and to distinguish his assertions from his
proofs, T find he agrees with the opinion expressed by myself, that Nzwrox's rule will not © pene,” as stated
by Newros, but only © perraro,” give the true number of imaginary roots.
