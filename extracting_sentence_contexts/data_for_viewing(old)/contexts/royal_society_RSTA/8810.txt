or a sufficiency of heating or carburization of the iron occurred. On the whole,
therefore, it would appear that all, or nearly all, the chemical reactions as such,
under pressures up to 6000 atmospheres, have given negative results.

The experiments on very rapid coolingâ€™ would seem to dispel the theory that
edrbon can be caught in a state of transition, and to lead us to the conclusion that
quick cooling is not in itself a cause of the occurrence of diamond in rapidly
cooled iron.

Morssan observed that when the spherules of granulated iron were cracked, or
contained geodes, no diamond was ever found in them, and he attributed this to
want of mechanical pressure. The experiments we have made not only corroborate
this fact, but they tend to show, we think conclusively, that the cracks in the
spherules act by allowing a free passage for the occluded gases to escape, and the
geodes by providing cavities in which the gases can find lodgment without much
gaseous pressure occurring in the metal.* Further, the experiments have shown that
iron when it sets does not expand with appreciable force, and that the only com>
pressive forces that are brought to bear on the interior are those arising from the
contraction of the outer layers.

Our experiments further show that when a crucible of molten iron is subjected to
pressure more than three times as great as can be produced by these contractile
forces, the yield of diamond is not increased. On the other hand, when the

* Conversely they may act to allow gases to enter the metal.
