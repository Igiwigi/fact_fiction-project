Proof. Note that the optimal controls wx, of the finite-dimensional optimal control problems
(5.11)-(5.12) belongs to X = L\((0,T],U), which is a compact set with respect to the weak topology
of L!. Hence, (uxX)Nen admits a subsequence, which we do not relabel, weakly convergent to
some u* € L!([0, T],U/). Moreover, as done in the proof of theorem 3.3, we can associate with each
of these controls a sequence of solutions ¢y(t) = (yn(t), wn (6), MN (E)) == (Yn (t), WN (E), Xn (b), UN (E))

of (5.4) uniformly convergent to a solution ¢,(t) = (y.(t),w.(#), ux(#)) of (5.2) in the sense of : >
definition 3.1 with control u*. In order to conclude that u* is an optimal control for (5.4), we |
need to show that it is actually a minimizer of F. For that, we use the fact that F is the -limit of : S
the sequence (Fy)Newn as proved in theorem 5.3. Let u € X be an arbitrary control and let (11y)Nen : 3
be a recovery sequence given by the I’ — limsup condition, so that a
F(u) = lim sup Fy (un). (5.13)
N00

By using now the optimality of (uy))Nen

lim sup Fy (uy) = lim sup Fy (uy) = lim inf Fy (uy). (5.14)
N00 N00 N-0o

Applying the  — lim inf condition yields
lim inf Fy(uyy) = F(u*). (5.15)
