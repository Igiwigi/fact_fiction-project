It is certain that as the equator is
approached the value of H, rises, and that of T, falls. The observations are not
sufficient to show the connection between H,, T,, and the latitude, but as an
approximation we may take H, = 16 km. and T, = —80° C, at the equator. Any theory that is to explain the general circulation of the atmosphere, the
distribution of temperature, and the formation of storms, must agree with the
observed facts, but it is extremely difficult to form any theory without being involved
at once in a mass of contraditions. Yet the motion and temperature of the
atmosphere must be dependent on the well-known principles of mechanics and
thermodynamics, and it ought to be possible to get some clue that may lead toa
reasonable explanation. The making of observations and then tabulating them is a
tedious business unless it leads to something further, but all I can do in discussing
these results is to point out difficulties which I do not profess to have solved.
