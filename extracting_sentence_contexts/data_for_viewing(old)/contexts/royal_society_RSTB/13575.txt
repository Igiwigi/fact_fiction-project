in toothpastes and bathroom salts. Further toothpaste ingre-
dients include minerals with appropriate hardness for use
as abrasives. Minerals with high astringency act as antiseptics
and disinfectants (in deodorants, for example), while min-
erals reacting with cysteine are suitable keratolytic reducers.
One typical prerequisite is that minerals used in pharmaceu-
ticals and cosmetics be free of any natural content of or
contamination with toxic chemicals. One exemption is min-
erals used as emetics. Here, the action of (toxic) Cu?* and
Zn** ions is used to induce vomiting, which at the same
time eliminates these toxicants from the body.

Highly relevant for medicinal purposes is the fact that
some types of clay exhibit bacteriostatic and bactericidal
activity [200]. Chemical effects of clays on bacteria appear
to dominate the antibacterial mechanisms [213,214]. Relevant
mechanisms causing the antibacterial activity of different
minerals and more specifically of clays have been summar-
ized in the excellent review by Williams [201]. These
mechanisms encompass the sorptive properties of minerals
