where &7 are the acoustic mode eigenvalues and ar is the equivalent radius of the resonator 2S
at temperature T. The term Af? represents the sum of several small frequency perturbations, [3
for which corrections were applied. The most important of these is the thermal boundary Dy
layer [28,29], which reduces the mode frequencies by approximately 10~4f2, and increases ¢° by [3
a near-equal amount. In applying this correction, we used the argon thermal conductivity values [3
recently calculated by Mehl, as reported in [3]. Smaller corrections, of the order of approximately .
10~®f2, were applied for the dissipation of energy in the bulk of the gas [25], the presence of gas
inlet and outlet ducts [30], the mechanical compliance of the transducers [25], the second-order
acoustic eigenvalue perturbation owing to the ellipsoidal shape [31] and the temperature-jump
effect [32]. For the latter, we used a value of h = 0.777 for the thermal accommodation coefficient
at all temperatures, which was derived from low-pressure measurements at Typw in our previous
work [5]. We investigate the effects of a temperature-dependent h in §4c(vii). Another small
correction was applied for the fact that the ‘isotherms’ are not truly isothermal owing to small
variations in the average Tog at each pressure. Each f;' on an isotherm was corrected to a common
Tog using an expression derived from equation (4.11). The uncertainty in the acoustic corrections
is discussed in §4c(vii).

The model approximates the pressure dependence of ur as a third-order expansion in p(p, T):

ur? (p) =uo,r°(1 + K(T)p + L(T)p* + M(T)p%), (4.11)

where 9? = yokgT/m is the limiting low-density speed-of-sound squared. The coefficients K, L
and M are the second, third and fourth acoustic virial coefficients, which are connected via exact
relations to the density virial coefficients B, C and D [33]. The gas densities p(p, T) were calculated
using equation (4.2).
