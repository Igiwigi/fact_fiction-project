to imagine that the only data that will be available during the mission are a few status flags. All
other data products need even more time to be transferred and analysed, through the very limited
communication channel. Half an hour was lost before seeing the effect of a single command,
which is a long time considering the overall lifetime of roughly 17h due to battery lifetime.
In addition to the planned scientific operations, the design of the autonomy manager needed
considerations regarding battery lifetime and thermal constraints since the round-trip time was
several hours. The power drain from the battery was optimized to extend the lifetime and also to
control the temperature inside the electronics box. The transfer of data to the spacecraft needed
strict planning as the connection was dependent on asteroid rotation. Another aspect was the
development time of only four years to set-up a lander for such a harsh environment. Unit tests
sped up developing processes, but still an overall system test was needed in vacuum and thermal
environment to make sure that EMC, thermal and power conditions are within the expected
range. Due to the fact that the installed instruments are very sensitive, calibration and reference
measurements need to take place. Partly this was conducted during cruise phase because the
launch window was fixed.

3, Present and future works towards planetary exploration: ARCHES and Martian
Moon exploration

In this section, we describe our current ongoing and future efforts in order to build up scientific
robotic systems for lunar missions. The first part illustrates the ARCHES mission, which has the
task to develop and demonstrate key technologies for a heterogeneous robotic team. The second
part deals with the MMX mission, which has the aim of sending a semi-autonomous robot to the
Martian Moon Phobos.
