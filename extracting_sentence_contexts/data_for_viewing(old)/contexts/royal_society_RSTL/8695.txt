and positive values of the coordinate 6.

If, moreover, we assume that the distribution which corresponds to the given potential
V is a distribution of a finite mass [edw . . . dz over a finite portion of the plane w=0,
viz. over a portion or area such that the distance of a point within the area from a fixed
point, or say from the origin (@... ce) = (0... . 0), is always finite; this being s0, we
have the further condition that the prepotential V must for indefinitely large values of
all or any of the coordinates (2. . .c, e) reduce itself to the form

(ſedz...4)=(@... +&+&Y*7,

The assumptions upon which this last condition is obtained are perhaps UNNeCcesSAry ;
instead of the condition in the foregoing form we, in fact, use only the condition that
the prepotential vanishes for a point at infinity, that is when all or any one or more
of the coordinates ( . . . c, 6) are or is infinite.

Again, as we have seen, the prepotential V must satisfy the prepotential equation

These conditions satisfied, to the given prepotential V, there corresponds on the plane
w=0, a distribution given by the foregoing formula, and which will be a distribution
over a finite portion of the plane, as already mentioned.
