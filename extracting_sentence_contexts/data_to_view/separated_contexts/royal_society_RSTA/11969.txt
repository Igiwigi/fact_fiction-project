THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM, 729

energy depends on the components of the strain of the medium, as it would do if the
medium possessed the properties of an elastic solid.
‘ At any rate, MacCuLiacH assumes a purely rotational quadratic expression for
_ | the energy, which he reduces to its principal axes in the ordinary manner; and then
he deduces from it in natural and easy sequence, without a hitch, or any forcing of
© constants, all the known laws of propagation and reflexion for transparent isotropic
and crystalline media, In common with Neumany, he cannot understand how with
| Fresvet the inertia in a erystal could be different in different directions, or its
“pl| elasticity isotropic ; so he assumes the density of the wether to be the same in all
& media, but its elasticity to be variable. The laws of crystalline reflexion are then
a established as below, and shown to be embraced in a single theorem relating either
Hi to his transversals or to his polar plane ; and the memoir ends with a remark ‘“ which
may be necessary to prevent any misconception as to the nature of the foundation on
g which” the theory stands. “ Everything depends on the form of the function V;
= and we have seen that, when that form is properly assigned, the laws by which
& Systals act upon light are included in the general equations of dynamics. This fact
16 is fully proved by the foregoing investigations. But the reasoning which has been
2 used to account for the form of the function is indirect, and cannot be regarded as
z sufficient, in a mechanical point of view. It is, however, the only kind of reasoning
that we are able to employ, as the constitution of the luminiferous medium is
entirely unknown.”
