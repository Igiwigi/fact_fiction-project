where 7(f) is a sufficiently regular function 7: R > R, are all Casimirs of (3.8). A simple direct
verification of (3.6) proves it.
With the Poisson bracket (3.8), the kinetic equation (3.3) becomes

This equation (in fact a family of equations parametrized by the energy E(f)) is the point of

departure. First, in §3d, we recall the Boltzmann analysis of the approach to equilibrium and
in §3e, we discuss the approach to fluid mechanics.

(c) Poisson hierarchies

Before discussing reductions in Hamiltonian systems, we turn to a less ambitious goal. We just
want to reformulate the Hamiltonian dynamics into a new form that may hopefully be more
suitable for the pattern recognition process in the phase portrait P. As for the passage f(r, v) >
ye, we shall see that a useful reformulation (due to Boltzmann [10]) consists of identifying
one particular event in the time evolution, namely the binary collision, and separating the
Hamiltonian vector field into two parts, one generating the outcome of binary collisions and the
