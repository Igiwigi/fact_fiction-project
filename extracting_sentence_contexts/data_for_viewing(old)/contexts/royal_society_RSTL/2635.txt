It cannot be disputed that more accurate knowledge on this point would afford
us a better clue to the respective office of the grand divisions of the enkephalon
than any other. Some physiologists even in the present day have argued that the
office of the cerebellum must be immediately connected with the phenomena of sen-
sation, from erroneously supposing that the tracts of sensation are alone continuous
with its strncture.

Anatomists when engaged in studying the relations of the spinal cord to the cere-
bral mass, have generally pursued the dissection from below upwards, on account of
the great facility of tracing its fibres in that direction. In s0 doing they have hitherto

* From several facts, which it is unnecessary to mention at present, I have little doubt that each ide of the
cord is equally divided into a motor and a sensory tract, the anterior half being appropriated to volition, the
po*terior to sensation.

followed the anterior and lateral columns of the cord solely to the cerebrum, and the
posterior columns exclusively to the cerebellum. Consequently the corpora resti-
formia or processus e cerebello ad medullam oblongatam have been described as con-
sisting entirely of fibres from the posterior columns*,
