It is a well-known fact that viscous shear stresses have
a small influence on roll damping. The eddy-making damping depends on the instantaneous
positions, velocities and strengths of shed vorticity. The latter fact can be qualitatively indicated
by using a thin free-shear layer and boundary layer method as presented by Faltinsen &
Pettersen [23]. It follows then that the motion of the separation points as it is accounted for in
the nonlinear method causes a different expression for the amount of shed vorticity. Figure 8b
shows the heave damping coefficient B33 predicted by the two hybrid methods as a function of
heave amplitude.
