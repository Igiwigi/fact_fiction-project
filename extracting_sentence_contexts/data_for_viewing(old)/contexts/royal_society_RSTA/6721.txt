P, M. GRUNDY ON INTEGRALLY DEPENDENT INTEGRAL DOMAINS _ 305

For proof, every element of the quotient ring § of S, with respect to qG, is expressible as
ga '(fb~')~', witha, fe S; a, be R; a,bA0 mod p;f40 mod q. Sinceza!(fb-!)-! = ab(af)-
it is clear that § < G,. The reverse inequality, § = G,, follows from the fact that

(qS,) aASc= q-

Of the remarks about the 1-1 correspondence, (i) follows from quotient-ring theory (e.g.
from Grundy 1942, §13). Finally, the result just proved for § shows that the isolated com-
ponent of pS, with respect to qG, is (pG,) n S,; and to justify (ii) it is only necessary to
add that (pS,)9 S,9 S = (pS,) 0 S = (pS),

(4.4) Suppose q is a prime G-ideal lying over p, the residue field of p being embedded
in, that of q according to the identification principle. Then another application of the
identification principle sends these fields into the residue fields of pR, and qG, respectively.
