adventitious strands. In several places the scalariform or spiral nature of the xylem
development in the cracks is evident. These strands are obviously identical in origin
with those which occur in 2. tetrapteridoides and R. africanum, the adventitious
strands of which are therefore probably composed of similar elements. In the
specimen of secondary wood from Dordrecht (see p. 80) there is a small crack in

which tracheids of precisely the same nature occur. All these facts lead up to the
inevitable conclusion that Rhevoxylon and Antarcticoxylon are generically the same,
and this leads to a consideration of the contrast in the relative sizes and developments
of their medullary and perimedullary regions. In Antarcticoxylon, with its small
pith, it is difficult to credit the existence of a series of well-developed centripetal
secondary wood masses such as occurs in the other specimens of Ihexowcylon. On the
other hand, it may represent a young axis in which the perimedullary growth has not
started.
