It may be represented by the slight branching of the posterior end
of the sulcus identified as the horizontal element, or it may be in part included
in the medial operculum ; it is impossible to say. The sulcus parietalis transversus
is confluent with the pars horizontalis sulci intraparietalis. The arcus parieto-
occipitalis is not in any way elongated, in fact rather contracted, so that the question
as to whether dolichocephaly plays any part in the open condition of these sulci
must be ruled out. It seems more reasonable to attribute the condition seen in
these two hemispheres to lack of development of the parietal lobe. Group 2

In this group the arcus parieto-occipitalis is well defined.
