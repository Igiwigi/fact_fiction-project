research, the political responsibility for decisions arising following the detection
of extra-terrestrial life cannot and should not rest with them. Any such decision

will require a broad societal dialogue and a proper political mandate. If extra-
terrestrial life happens to be detected, a coordinated response that takes into
account all the related sensitivities should already be in place. In 1989, the
International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) approved a SETI post-detection
protocol [51], which was developed by one of its committees. Despite the fact
that it has subsequently been endorsed by the International Institute of Space
Law (IISL), the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the International
Council for Science (ICSU), the International Astronomical Union (LAU) and the
International Union of Radio Science (URSI), the procedures laid out in that
document are not legally enforcible. If it remains a voluntary code of practice, it
will probably be ignored in the event to which it should apply. Will a suitable
process based on expert advice from proper and responsible scientists arise at all,
or will interests of power and opportunism more probably set the scene (cf. {52])?
A lack of coordination can be avoided by creating an overarching framework in
a truly global effort governed by an international politically legitimated body.
The United Nations fora constitute a ready-made mechanism for coordination.
