mean net CRE between the amip and amip4K experiments for all available years (as documented
in §2) and dividing by the corresponding change in the long-term annually averaged global
mean near-surface temperature [75]. This method tends to yield less positive/more negative
values of cloud feedback than alternative approaches based on the alternative ‘partial radiative
perturbation’ method because it includes the masking effect of climatological cloudiness on non-
cloud feedbacks [76]. It is however a good predictor of inter-model spread in cloud feedback [77].

By comparing the models’ global cloud feedbacks with and without convective
parametrization, we can directly test the hypothesis that a substantial fraction of the inter-model
spread is due to differences in the details of the convective parametrizations. If this were the
case, then we would expect to see a considerable reduction in the inter-model spread in the
ConvOff experiments. The standard models have a range of 1.07 (—0.34 to 0.73) W m*K~!. This
range is not reduced however in the ConvOff experiments; in fact it increases by 23% to 1.32
(—0.52 to 0.80) Wm~* K~1. Similarly, the standard deviation increases by 25%. At face value, this
would seem to indicate that differences in the details of convective parametrizations are not the
dominant cause of inter-model spread in global mean cloud feedbacks in this particular selection
of climate models.
