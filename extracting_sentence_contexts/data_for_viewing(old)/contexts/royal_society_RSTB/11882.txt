5. Conclusion

The present experimental data speak to the effectiveness of IC
in the context of social robotics, extending the evidence to a
nonhuman ‘outgroup’. Owing to our multi-method approach,
the findings go beyond previous research [19-21] and provide
insights into participants’ perception and behaviour during
actual HRI. The results imply that it is beneficial to tailor the
IC scenario to the HRI situation and, by that, give a possible
explanation for the fact that previous studies had rather

mixed results with regards to the effectiveness of IC in the
context of social robotics. Furthermore, the results have
important implications for future research. First, further
research has to identify the ideal fit between IC and actual
human-robot contact for maximal IC effectiveness. Second,
our results support the assumption that IC offers a behavioural
script to guide the performance in an interaction situation,
which should be examined in more detail. Above and
beyond, the experimental paradigm of the memory card
game with the robot NAO serves as a fruitful basis for
various follow-up studies to further clarify the boundary con-
