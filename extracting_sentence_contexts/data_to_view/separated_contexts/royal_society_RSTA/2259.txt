This implies that the grand unification monopole (with the huge Higgs vacuum value) could
be much more sensitive to the gravitational instability than the electroweak monopole, and more
easily change to a black hole when coupled to the gravity. Moreover, with ey(p(0o)) = 1, the long-range tail of the monopole is given by

m=M rg, (7.12)

This shows that (even for the globally regular solutions) the metric for the monopole becomes : 2
asymptotically Reissner-Nordstrom type, with ADM mass equal to M and the magnetic charge : >
Qm = 4rr/e. :§
Our result shows that the generic feature of the gravitating electroweak monopole solution is Los
quite similar to the gravitating ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole solution obtained by Breitenlohner :<
et al. [29]. In fact, mathematically our solution could be viewed as the electroweak generalization : =
of their solution. From the physical point of view, however, they are totally different. Theirs is |
hypothetical, but ours describes the real monopole dressed by the physical W-boson and Higgs : S
field. :3
Clearly, our solutions must have important applications on the monopole stars and the : &

magnetically charged black holes.
