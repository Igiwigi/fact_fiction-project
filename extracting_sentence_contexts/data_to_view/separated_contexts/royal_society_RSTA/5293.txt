This point requires
further investigation ; but it may be pointed out that the same effect occurs in the
case of standard silver. The most fusible alloy of the copper-silver series is the one
which contains about 650 parts of silver in 1000, and it might, therefore, be expected
that the centre of an alloy containing more silver than 65 per cent. would be poorer
in silver than the outside; nevertheless, the authorities, Levon, Roperts-AUSTEN,
and in fact, all who have worked with silver-copper alloys know the contrary to be
the case. Silver is driven inwards notwithstanding the fact that an alloy poor in
silver remains fluid long after the mass as a whole has become comparatively solid. The platinum-gold alloys now in question behave like the silver-copper series.
