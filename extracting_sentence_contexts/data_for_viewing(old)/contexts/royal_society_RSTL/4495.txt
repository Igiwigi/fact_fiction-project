they are pushed out in the Elephant, the Wart-Hogs deviating very remarkably from
that and all other quadrupeds in this respect.

In the course of subsequent researches and comparisons, T have determined the
original specimens in the Britisgh Museum and that of the Royal College of Surgeons,
which were drawn and engraved to illustrate How's paper, by which I have ascer-
tained that the drawings were taken from two distinct species of Phacocherus ; and
T have been able to detect certain inaccuracies in the reduced figures in the engravings,
which give countenance, not afforded by the specimens themselyes, to the ideas of
the mode of succession of the teeth described in Home's paper. I propose, therefore,
to give a more precise description of the subjects of the beautiful engravings, tab.
xviii. and xix. of the Philosophical Transactions for 1799, and to add the additional
facts and illustrations of the peculiarities of the dentition characteristic of the two
species of Wart-Hog, and which determine the true number, kinds and succession of
the grinding-teeth in both species.

Tab. xvii. (Philosophical Transactions, 1799) gives a view of the skull'of an old Pha-
cocherus Aliani, Van per Hogven, the common species of Nubia, Abyssinia, Senegal
and Cordofan, and sometimes called the North African Wart-Hog. It is well charac-
terized by having, when fully grown, six functional incisors in the under jaw and two
incisors (3. 1.) in the upper jaw, together with forms and proportions of the other
teeth, which will be subsequently adverted to. The characteristic incisors are suffi-
ciently indicated in the figure; the large posterior grinders are alone retained in the
molar series of both jaws.
