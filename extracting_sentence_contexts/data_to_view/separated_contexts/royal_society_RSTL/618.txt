Saucepans, and other kitchen utensils, which are very clean
and bright on the outside, may be kept hot with a smaller fire
than such as are black and dirty ; but the bottom of a saucepan,
or boiler, should be blackened, in order that its contents may
be made to boil quickly, and with a small expence of fuel. When kitchen utensils are used over a fire of sea-coal, or of
wood, there will be no necessity for blackening their bottoms,
for they will 800n be made black by the smoke; but, when
they are used over a clear fire made with charcoal, it will be
adviseable to blacken them; which may be done in a few mo-
ments, by holding them over a wood or coal fire, or over the
flame of a lamp, or candle. Proposals have often been made for constructing the broad
and shallow vessels (flats) in which brewers cool their wort, of
metal; on a supposition that the process of cooling would go
on faster in a metallic vessel than in a wooden vessel; but this
would not be found to be the case in fact, a metallic surface
being ill calculated for expediting the emission of caloritic
Tays. The great thickness of the timber of which brewers flats are
commonly made, is a circumstance very favourable to a speedy
cooling of the wort; for, when the flats are empty, this mass of
wet wood is much cooled, not only by the cold air which passes
over it, but also, and more especially, by evaporation ; and,
when the flat is again filled with hot wort, a great part of the
heat of that liquid is absorbed by the cold wood. In all cases where metallic tubes filled with steam are used

for warming rooms, or for heating drying-rooms, the external
surface of those tubes should be painted, or covered with some
substance which facilitates the emission of calorific rays.
