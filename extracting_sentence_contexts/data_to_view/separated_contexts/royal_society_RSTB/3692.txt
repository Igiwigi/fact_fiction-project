FRYER ON AN INVESTIGATION BY PEDIGREE

In brood 47 there should be equal numbers of cyrus 2s and mimetic ?s, while
among the latter the romulus and polytes 3s ought also to be equal. The first
condition is approximately realised, but there were 7 romulus 98:2 polytes 2s
instead of equality. The work as a whole seems to show conclusively that the inheritance phenomena
in P. polytes can be expressed in Mendelian terms; the scheme proposed may have
to be modified in accordance with future discoveries, but nevertheless when the
difficulties of obtaining reliable numbers in pedigree work with butterflies are
considered, it seems that the hypotheses proposed are supported very fairly by the
facts produced in the course of the experiments. CHAPTER III. General Conclusions and Comparisons.
