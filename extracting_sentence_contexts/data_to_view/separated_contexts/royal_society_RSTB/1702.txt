That they are not wings is shown by the fact that in a series of sections —
of the same petiole, their position never remains constant. Further evidence as to '
their real form is afforded by the fact that in longitudinal sections their appearance —
iv essentially the same as in transverse section (see Memoir XVIL., fig. 8), and also
by the fact that the cross section of the emergence itself is circular (loc. cit.). :

We have figured a peculiar form of these emergences, which is not unfrequently
met with (see Plate 23, fig. 12). The emergence has the usual thick-walled superficial —
layer ; its internal parenchyma is generally thin-walled, but near the free extremity,
there is a sharply defined group of well-preserved cells, with strongly marked walls
and brown contents.
