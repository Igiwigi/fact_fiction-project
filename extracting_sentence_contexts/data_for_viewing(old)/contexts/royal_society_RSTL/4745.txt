to which he has added the fall at his own bungalow or house, equidistant between
the town and cantonment, s0 that the three localities are within the range of a mile.

Cantonment Hospital .
Hill Fort, above the town of Sattarah...

The increased fall of rain in the town of Sattarah, which is 2320 feet above the
sea-level, is no doubt chiefly caused by the hill, 3200 feet above the sea-level, upon
which the fort is situated, rising from the back of the town ; but this will not account
for the difference in the fall at the Bungalow and Cantonment Hospital. The facts
show how necessary is a local knowledge of physical features before generalizations
can be ventured upon safely.

In my former paper in the Philosophical Transactions I pointed out the remark-
able differences in the fall of rain, twenty to twenty-five years ago on the sea coast,
at the top of the Ghats, and at Poona, thirty-five miles to the eastward of the Ghats.
Dr. Murray confirms my views in a much more detailed manner than I was enabled
to attempt, in the following Table for the year 1848 ;â€”
