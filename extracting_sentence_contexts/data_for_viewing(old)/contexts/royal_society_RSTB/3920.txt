(b) Titterstone Clee Hill.

The geology of the Clee Hills has been discussed by Wricut,* Murcuison,t+
Puiiuips,} Symonps,ยง Joners,|| and others. Mr. Danie Jones has attempted to
correlate the Coal Measures of Clee Hills with those of the Wyre Forest and
Coalbrookdale.

Quite recently Mr, Ernest Drxon** has made a special study of the geology of
Titterstone Clee Hill, of which, however, only a short abstract has yet been
published. His results, however, are of particular interest. Among them we may
notice the conclusions that the Coal Measures rest unconformably on the so-called
Millstone Grit, which, in part at least, is really of Lower Carboniferous Age, He
notices also the fact that red clays and green Espley sandstones are a feature of the
Coal Measures, and agrees with the previously expressed view that the Clee Hill
Measures belong to the same horizon as the Sweet Coal series of the Wyre Forest.
He believes that they correspond to part of the Etruria Marl Series. He points out
that a fairly rich flora occurs in the Coal Measures, which, however, Dr. Kinston
regards as a Middle Coal Measure flora, and therefore one belonging to a lower
horizon than the Etruria Marl Series. No details of the flora collected have been
published as yet.

It is obvious that these results with regard to Titterstone Clee Hill have an
important bearing on the present work on the Wyre Forest. There have been for
some years past a few plants from Titterstone Clee in the Sedgwick Museum, and
this collection has recently been increased by Mr. Rogers, I append a list of these
