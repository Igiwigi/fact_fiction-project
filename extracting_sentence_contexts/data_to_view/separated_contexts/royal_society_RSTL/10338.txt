Much the same may be aid of both the total mineral matter and the nitrogen taken
up. Indeed, much more of the mineral matter has been annually removed in the first
crops only, over the last five years, than over the preceding six, and including the
second Crops, very much more ; in fact, annually more than over the first 20 years. of
nitrogen there was, including the firs} and second crops, more than one-third more
annually taken off without manure, more on plot 2 with dung or its residue alone, and
one-third more on plot 1 with the ammonia-salts in addition, over the last five, than
over the preceding 20 years. Tt is obvious, therefore, that the removal of the second
crops in the later years is, as before said, rapidly accelerating exhaustion, a fact which
