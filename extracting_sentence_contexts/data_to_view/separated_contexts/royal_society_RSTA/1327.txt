history. If there is a strong monsoon over the sea areas the microseisms are strongly
marked, and when the monsoon weakens, the microseisms, too, become weak. Tt is, in fact, the roughness of the sea caused by the monsoon current that determines
the intensity of the monsoon microseisms. ‘To make this point clear, the amplitudes of
the microseisms during the monsoon months of 1924 and 1925, and also the estimated
state of the neighbouring seas, have been plotted in fig. 3.
