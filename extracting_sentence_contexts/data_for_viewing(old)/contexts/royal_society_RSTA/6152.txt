8. Some phenomenological applications for the current universe

After a good deal of technically difficult efforts aimed at putting the foundations of the RVM ona
sound theoretical basis within QFT in curved space-time, it should now be welcome to bring
forward some phenomenological applications. We may start from the low-energy expression
(5.10), or even from the generalized one containing an additional term ~H and a new coefficient
d which is also possible [57,58]

Pvac(H) = arc + vH? + 5H) + O(H%). (8.1)

The additive parameter cp is the same as in (7.4), fixed by pyac(Ho) = Porc Mind that co cannot
vanish as otherwise the model would be excluded due to the absence of an inflection point
from deceleration into acceleration in the cosmic evolution, see [89-92]. In particular, this fact
alone excludes the simpler model pyac(H) « H? asa consistent vacuum model. Within the class of
the RVMs, however, the condition cp #0 is always guaranteed. Let us just note that an additive
constant is always generated from integrating the RG equation associated with the 6-function
(6.13).

The RVM has many phenomenological applications, see the aforementioned papers and also
the monographs [137,138] and references therein. Even though the small parameters |v,i| «1
can be fundamentally linked to QFT quantum effects (which is of course the touchstone for a
solid theoretical underpinning of the RVM), it should be clear that they are ultimately to be
fitted to observations since the number of fields contributing can be large and we ignore the
details of the underlying GUT ultimately responsible for such a dynamics. We can simplify
our phenomenological analysis with the choice ) = v/2. In this way, equation (8.1) takes on the
