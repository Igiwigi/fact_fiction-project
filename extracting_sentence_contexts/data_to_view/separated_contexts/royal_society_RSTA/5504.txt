This behaviour was also observed for water confined between
hydrophobic plates when the density of water is high enough to create three distinct layers [13]. We find this behaviour for all the investigated pores, even for the highest hydrophilicity. In fact,
in the case of water confined in hydrophilic confinement, the layers of water closer to the surface
were shown to be immobile and even in a glassy state already at high temperature [26,27,49,50]. In silica pores, water of the contact layers can form hydrogen bonds directly with the pore
wall [29,51] and the mobility of these molecules may vanish due to these strong directional
hydrogen bonds [26,49]. The different behaviour observed in the present simulations seems
related to the fact that the considered pore lacks the ability to form hydrogen bonds directly with
water molecules; this feature contributes to the increase of the number of hydrogen bonds in the
contact layer and the decrease in the inner layer.
