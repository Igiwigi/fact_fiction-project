can be manipulated or misinterpreted by persons or groups
that may have a pre-determined agenda. We emphasize the
challenges of such debate through the discussion of recent
case studies [17,18,99], some of which were highly publicized
within the UK media. Through these case studies, we high-
light how the scientific position can become skewed both
within scientific publications themselves, and in their
subsequent representation within the media.

(b) Representation of fire in scientific publications

The context set by Yallop et al. [99] is a relatively balanced dis-
cussion of benefits and costs of managed fire, except for the fact
that for some research areas they consider the evidence base to
support their assertions was rather limited. This was (and still
is) particularly true for the effects of fire on C sequestration.
Yallop et al. [99] cite one paper where managed burning was
shown to reduce C sequestration in peat bogs [65]. However,
Garnett et al. [65] were unable to examine the effects across
all replicates and treatments at their Moor House Hard Hill
experiment and hence their experiment lost the power of the
replicated experimental design. It is also evident that for
much of Yallop et al.â€™s C-focused discussion there is a reliance
on wildfire papers from boreal studies outside the UK (e.g.
[94,105]). This is undoubtedly a consequence of the lack of
