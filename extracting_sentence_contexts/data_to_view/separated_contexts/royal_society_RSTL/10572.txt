We found also that snecessive films, when thus treated, behaved in a much more
uniform way than if the flooding was omitted, We have at times replaced the metal L
rings by the glass ones, and been most careful that the liquid shonld touch nothing
but glass and linen, but the phenomenon above described was as marked as before. Lastly, if one of the films was thickened by the electric current it contracted just as
i would do if thickened by flooding. The fact thab the thicker film displayed the
greater surface tension cannot, therefore, be due to any peculiarity: of the apparatus
or mode of thickening adopted. Experiment TIT. As a crucial test as to whether the weight of the thicker film had anything to do
with the phenomenon, we placed the larger rings on the upper and the smaller rings
on the lower supports.
