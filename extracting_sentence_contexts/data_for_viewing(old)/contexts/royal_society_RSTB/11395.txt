influencing the comprehension process, changes in the (I'm feeling down) [74]. Specifically, participants were faster


determining that a word had a positive meaning if it
appeared in the upper part of a screen, and faster at deter-
mining a negative meaning if it appeared in the screen’s
lower section.

However, further research complicates this picture. One
issue is that few such effects are strongly automatic, in the
sense of occurring when participants engage in a simple
reading or a lexical decision task. In fact, in order to find
valence-space congruency effects, participants must usually
be focused on processing valence [75]. One exception is
words referring to emotions that are experientially tied to
spatially specific body postures (e.g. happiness goes with
an upright posture, whereas sadness tends to go with a
slouched posture). Consistent with this idea, relevant
emotion words seem to automatically activate vertical space
(happy — up; sad — down), even in a shallow task that
does not require valence judgement, (e.g. responding to ink
colour with an up versus downwards directed movement)
[76]. This finding resonates with evidence that experiential
associations in space-valence mapping are more important
