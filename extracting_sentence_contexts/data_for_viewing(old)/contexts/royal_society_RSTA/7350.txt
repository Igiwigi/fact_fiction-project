in the spaces in fig. 5, and an examination of the diagram shows that P is the pole of
a family of spirals, each of which surrounds P, while it comes in closer and closer to P,
reaching it after an infinite number of revolutions. Further, from (13-1) we see that
the sign of q’ is the same as the sign of cos y u’* —cos @, since u’ is always positive; hence
q' is positive outside I and negative inside I.

Mathematically speaking, each hodograph (a) in fig. 5, commencing with some
large value of u’, goes round the pole O a number of times, and then falls short of O,
and describes a spiral inwards round P. Hence each path consists of a number of
loops, followed by a number of undulations of diminishing angular amplitude. In fact
the corrected phugoid partakes of the character of both loops and undulations, the
undulations consisting of a closer and closer approximation to the steady glide in the
direction y. Whether loops will appear or not, in fact, depends on whether the initial
point is taken before or after the last loop in the path.

There is one exceptional hodograph, (4) in fig. 5, which passes through the pole 0.
It clearly does so tangentially to the direction @ = + 4n, and then curls in towards P.
This particular hodograph gives a path, which, after describing loops, describes its
last loop (or its first undulation) in the degenerate form of a cusp which points
vertically upwards; after this it undulates with diminishing angular amplitude, and
approximates more and more closely to the steady glide 6 = —y. As in Lanchester’s
semicircular phugoid, the cusp bears little relation to the truth, since the approxima-
tion involves that w’ never becomes zero, which it does at a cusp.

We have a descriptive account of the corrected phugoids. More definite results
