& Penrose 1996) concerning the biological nature of consciousness also would depend
critically upon a positive result from such an experiment.

None of the present popular suggestions for uniting space-time structure with
quantum theory makes any serious attempt to accommodate quantum state reduc-
tion; so for this reason alone I am sceptical of their eventual success unless they
can undergo substantial changes. I would also give little credence to current popular
theories (such as inflationary cosmology) that attempt to account for the structure
of the early universe, since the ultimate unknown appears to be this same missing
‘quantum gravity’ theory. It is quantum gravity, in some form, that ultimately gov-
erns the very uniform structure of the Big Bang space-time singularity, but it also
must govern the very non-uniform singularities in black holes. Evidence coming from
the existence of the second law of thermodynamics, and other observational facts,
indeed points to a gross time-asymmetry in the appropriate union between general
relativity and quantum mechanics. This, again, is not a feature of any of the exist-
ing proposals for that union, and this provides an additional reason for my personal
scepticism.

These remarks may seem like comments of despair; but I prefer to see things in
a more optimistic light. We can learn from existing attempts at a solution to this
problem of unification, and enough evidence may be thereby gained so that someone
may pick up the correct trail before too long. It is my expectation that there will
indeed be a new major revolution, and it should come sometime in the next century.
This would be both very exciting and fundamentally important to science as a whole.
