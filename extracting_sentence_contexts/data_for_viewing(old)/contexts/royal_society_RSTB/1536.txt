certainly for this segment it is clear that the posterior root is in relation with
efferent paths at least two segments below its attachment to the cord.

Again, if, in stimulating any given posterior lumbar root, movement resulted in
the lower limb, one or more of the anterior lumbar roots were then divided in various
sequences, with the result that certain differences of movement could be observed.
For instance, in one experiment excitation of the 6th posterior lumbar root gave
flexion of the hip, knee, ankle, and toes, contraction of the dorsal muscles of the
spine, and lateral movement in the tail to the same side; then, on dividing the
anterior root of the 4th, of the 5th, and of the 6th lumbar nerves successively, the
movements still obtained on the excitation of the 6th lumbar posterior root were
apparently exactly the same as before the section of the anterior roots. The same
fact was borne out by the following experiment in the opposite direction, viz., by
dividing the roots from below upwards. In this experiment excitation of the 5th
posterior lumbar root gave flexion of the hip, knee, ankle, and toes, and contraction
of the dorsal muscles of the spine. The Ist sacral anterior root was then divided,
and on stimulating the 5th posterior root as before the movements resulting were
flexion of the hip and knee and dorsal muscles, but the flexion of the ankle was less
than before, and the flexion of the toes was obliterated. The 7th anterior lumbar root
was then divided, and the 5th posterior root stimulated as before, giving the result of
flexion of the hip and the knee and of the dorsal muscles of the spine, but no move-
ment in the ankle, or, of course, in the toes. Jn order to completely exclude the
possibility of any efferent effects passing through the 2nd sacral—although my obser-
vations on the 2nd sacral anterior root accorded with those previously obtained by
Dr. Russext, showing that it has no functional relationship to the lower limb—it
