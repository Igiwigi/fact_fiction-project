outgrowths were developed, the light, even under the whitewashed glass, was of very
considerable intensity, whereas, when the leaves were examined for starch at the close
of the experiments, the weather had for several days been cooler, and the sky almost
continually overcast, so that the amount of light was reduced.

Comparing the distribution of starch with that of outgrowths, we find that, given
the necessary conditions of moisture, light, and heat, intumescences are formed when
starch is present and not when it is absent, except in the case of the plant grown
under whitewashed glass. But if transpiration is active, no intumescences are
formed even when starch is abundant, e.g., under free conditions in open air.

The tendency of the plant in Experiment 9 to form outgrowths at first, may be
due to the fact that at the beginning of the experiment the plant already possessed
carbohydrates in excess. The non-development of outgrowths in darkness (in
Experiment 15) and in submerged leaves (Experiment 8) is doubtless due to lack
of carbohydrates.

Another fact which points to the disturbance of the normal metabolism of the
plant is the abnormally large quantity of oil present in the outgrowths and, especially
in Ipomea, in the adjacent parts of the leaf, more particularly in the neighbourhood
of the vascular tissue and in the palisade cells. This is striking, because oil is not
observable in the cells of the normal tissue of these leaves. A similar increase in oil
formation has also been noted by Soravert in Acacia pendula, in the ends of young
branches which had developed outgrowths on the side turned towards the light.
