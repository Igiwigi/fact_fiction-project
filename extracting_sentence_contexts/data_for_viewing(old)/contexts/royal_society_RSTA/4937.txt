quite explicit. A natural question is the extent to which we can infer from such information
the vanishing, or non-vanishing, of various cohomology groups. Here are some results along
this line.

Let us begin with the fact that Mj 1 (F,) = 1. By the Lefschetz Trace Formula, this is equivalent to

2n
S\(-1)'Trace(Frobr, AR F@F*’))=q".
i=0

Already the trace on the H2" is q”. This suggests that Hi(A! , F @ F”) vanishes for i # 2n. We will

now show that this is in fact the case. Here is an equivalent formulation.
The sheaf F @ FY = End(F) has a direct sum decomposition

End(F) = Qe @ End°(F),

in which End°(F) is the subsheaf of endomorphisms of trace zero. The fact that M1,1(F_) =1 is
thus equivalent to

2n
YO 1) Trace(Frobe, |Hi(AZ. , End°(F))) = 0.
