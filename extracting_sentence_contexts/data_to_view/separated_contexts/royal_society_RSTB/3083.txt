I hope to show, in
subsequent papers, that this conception of the mesenchyme, forming as it does an
essential part of Mryerâ€™s gonoccel theory, explains satisfactorily many anomalous
facts concerning the nephridia, almost inexplicable on any other hypothesis. The
general mass of embryological evidence of the past few years seems to be directly in
favour of this view, and fresh evidence from day to day seems only to strengthen its
position. I hope, however, to return to this subject in my final paper, when the
facts presented by a number of forms can be properly examined at length and
compared.

ventral plate of the ectoderm, lateral and anterior to the anus, as already mentioned.
