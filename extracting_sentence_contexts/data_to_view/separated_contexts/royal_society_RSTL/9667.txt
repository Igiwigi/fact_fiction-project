Calculation of the analytical
regults shows, however, that the increase in the amount of total mineral matter
removed under the influence of the addition of superphosphate was considerably
greater than was represented by the increased amount taken up of those mineral con-
stitnents which it supplied—namely, lime, magnesia, phosphorie acid, and sulphuric
acid. There was also more potass, in a greater proportion more soda, and more silica,
taken up—all of which must have been supplied by the s0il itself. It has before been
pointed out that the produce by ammonia-salts alone removed even less potass than
that without manure—a fact supposed to be explained by the greater root-range of the
much more varied flora of the unmanured plot ; and although the addition of snper-
phosphate to the ammonia-salts causes the removal of considerably more potass, there
is 8till not much more removed than without manure. There was, too, a very great
decline in the average annual amount taken up of almost every mineral constituent
over the second period compared with the first ; the exceptions being phosphoric acid
and magnesia, in which the reduction was much less. Further, whilst in the dry
substance there was (excepting lime) an abnormally high percentage of the mineral
constituents supplied, there was an abnormally low percentage of those not supplied—
again indicating that the point of exhaustion of available supply was reached.
