The Artificial Atmosphere.

23, A tin can, holding about 3 gallons, with the bottom and top coned upwards,
and strong enough to stand the full pressure of 60 pounds, was adopted. The air
connection with the can was at the top, at which there were also two side openings,
one with a cock, to admit of air being pumped into the can, and the other with a fine

screw stop for allowing a slow and definite escape of air. An opening at the bottom,
with a cock for drawing off water, was also provided. For forcing the air in, a syringe
for inflating bicycle tyres was used in the first instance and proved ample; in fact,
when once the pressure was raised, the small amount of air released from the water

was more than sufficient to maintain the pressure, so that it was continually allowed
to escape.

The Stuffing-box and Cap to prevent Leakage.

24. The thing that was revealed by the experiments at high temperatures was that
the leakage of water at the coned bushes of the brake was so much increased by the
