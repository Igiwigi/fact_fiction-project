As
described in the introduction, Nyangatom and Daasanach are
small ethnic groups with strong identities, living primarily as
nomadic pastoralists and inhabiting largely ethnically hom-
ogenous regions. They have a long history of violent conflicts
with each other that primarily take the form of tit-for-tat raiding
[39,54]. Though they also have trading relationships occasionally,
they recognize each other as enemies; in fact, the Nyangatom
refer to Daasanach as ‘emoit’, literally meaning ‘enemy’. Ethio-
pian Highlanders are ethnically heterogeneous and do not
engage in intergroup conflict with either Daasanach or
Nyangatom. Werecruited only adult male participants to best simulate real-
world between-group decision-making processes, where only
adult men are involved in intergroup conflict.
