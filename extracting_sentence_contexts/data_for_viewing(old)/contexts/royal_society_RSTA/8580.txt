iron with the result that, instead of being reduced, the average magnetic moment of
the eddy currents, for a given rate of change of the magnetic induction, was increased
about 25 times, and their angular momentum about 14 times as compared with the
corresponding values for the iron core alone.

As Srewarr points out, the E.M.F. which sets up the eddy currents, imparts an
impulse to the positive electricity present, which is in the same direction as the spin of
the electron gyrostats responsible for the magnetism of the specimen ; and since there is
as much negative as positive electricity in the metal, it imparts an equal and opposite
impulse to the negative electricity present.

The only chance of any measurable throw arising from these two opposing impulses
lies in the fact that they are not imparted to the rigid structure of the metal simul-
taneously. While that received by the positive electricity is given up to the metal at
once, the negative electricity retains the effect of its impulse as motion of the electrons
until, in coming to rest, they too impart their impulse to the metal, and the eddy currents
die down.

Two conditions are necessary for obtaining a measurable effect—the opposing
impulses must be large enough, and the time that elapses between their respective arrivals
at the metal must be appreciable compared with the quarter period of the suspended
system—and, as appears from what follows, neither condition is fulfilled, even in the
extreme case of the copper sheathed iron.

Since the magnetised specimen is very small the helix field, H,, and the
