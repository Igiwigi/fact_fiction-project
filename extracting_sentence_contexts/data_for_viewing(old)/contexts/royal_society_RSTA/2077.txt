(3.7)

Since the initial probability distribution function is fixed, the last term vanishes. Therefore,
from equation (2.11), it follows that equation (1.1) in fact holds. Consequently, the action is seen
to be invariant under the transformation generated by the weak invariant. This result offers a
reinterpretation of the variation in equation (2.10) in terms of the symmetry principle.

4. Concluding remarks

The action principle has been studied for the Fokker—Planck equation, and the associated weak
invariant has been shown to be the Noether charge generating the transformation, under which
the action remains unchanged.

It is noted that the variational approach discussed in the present work is radically different
from the one that is directly applied to thermodynamic variables and is somewhat criticized
in [37].
