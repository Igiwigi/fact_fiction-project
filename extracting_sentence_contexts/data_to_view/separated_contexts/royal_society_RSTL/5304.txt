This appears to be the precise reason why Professor Forsxs has failed to obtain the
numerous results described in the foregoing pages. His bearers were of such a form
that the mass of matter immediately surrounding the point of contact quickly abs-
tracted the heat communicated to that point, and thus destroyed the condition upon
which the vibrations depend. The snccess of the experiments described in this me-
moir depends on the precaution, that the abstraction of heat was prevented, to some
extent, by reducing the bearers to laminz and mere spikes; and the fact that a thin
edge gave a better tone than a thick one thus receives a full explanation. These
considerations, I think, render it clear that the cause of the superiority of lead assigned
by Professor Farapar is by no means an © oversight.” On the other hand it would
not be safe to aflirm generally, nor has it been affirmed by the philosopher last
mentioned, that the less the conducting power the greater will be the effect.
