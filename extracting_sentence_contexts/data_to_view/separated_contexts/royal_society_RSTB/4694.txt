Remnants of the membrana elastica externa
are recognisable in the adult, and, in Pristiophorus japonicus, the course taken by
the membrane, as seen in a transverse section, is one that passes through the inner
part of an intermedial calcification, then across the corner of the main ring, and then
through the inner part of the next intermediale. Thus it will be seen that the
outer-zone cartilage bulges out horizontally and vertically, and that the calcified
ring occurs partly in sheath-cartilage and partly in arch-cartilage. That too much
importance should not be attached to this, however, is evident from the fact that, in
caudal vertebrie of Pristiophorus nudipinnis,* the course of the membrane, while
agreeing, in so far as its relations to the intermedial calcification are concerned,
pursues a less sinuous line, and remains external to the main calcified ring. The ring
is consequently, in this latter species, a structure that belongs solely to the sheath-
cartilage. In Pliotrema warreni (tig. 24, B) the main calcified ring is thin, and with a
