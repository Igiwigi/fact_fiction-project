I mentioned in the BAKERIAN Lecture for 1807, that a modi-
fication of a phlogistic chemical theory might be defended on
the idea that the metals and inflammable solids, usually called
s}mple, were compounds of the same matter as that existing in
near to a metal in its characters, $0 that the metallic nature of steel does not mili-
tate against the reasoning in the text, The only facts which I am acquainted with,

that do militate against it, are the metallic characters of some of the sulphurets and
phosphurets of the imperfect metals,

hydrogene, with peculiar unknown bases, and that the oxides,
alkalies, and acids were compounds of the same bases with
water, and that the phaznomena presented by the metals of the
fixed alkalies might be explained on this hypothesis. The same mode of reasoning may be applied to the facts
of the metallization of the earths and ammonia, and perhaps
with rather stronger evidences in-its favour, but till it will
be less, distinct and simple, than the usually received theory
of oxygenation, which I have applied to them. The general facts of the combustion, and of the action of
these new combustible substances upon water, are certainly
most easily explained on the hypothesis of Lavotster ; and
the only good arguments in favour of a common principle of
inflammability, flow from some of the novel analogies in
electrochemical science. Assuming the existence of hydrogene in the amalgam of
ammonium, its presence in one metallic compound evidently
leads to the suspicion of its combination in others. And in
the electrical powers of the different species of matter, there
are circumstances which extend the idea to combustible sub-
stances in general.
