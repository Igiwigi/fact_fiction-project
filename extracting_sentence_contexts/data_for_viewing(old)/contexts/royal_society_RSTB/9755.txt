also governs the co-regulation of the injectisome with other
virulence mechanisms. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the RetS
sensor protein, another system involved in regulating Csr,
switches between expression of the T3SS and the type VI
secretion system by regulating c-di-GMP levels [86].

CsrA also controls motility, with CsrA upregulating the
expression of flagella by stabilizing the transcript of the flagel-
lar master operon flhDC [87,88]. Interestingly, CsrA not only
regulates motility in this post-transcriptional manner, but is
also directly involved in flagellum biosynthesis by suppressing
flagellin biosynthesis prior to completion of the flagellar T3SS
[89]. Based on the fact that the CsrA gene is mainly present in
genomes that encode flagellin, this has been postulated to be
the primordial function of the Csr system [89]. In addition,
CsrA directly regulates the expression of several main regula-
tors of c-di-GMP levels, connecting the two main pathways
influencing flagellar biosynthesis [90,91].

Both T3SS also can sense and react to the proximity of host
cells or other surfaces. Flagella can directly sense the increased
load on the motor, once a flagellum is stuck because of contact
toasurface, which can lead to a ‘swim-or-stick switch’, resulting
in the downregulation of expression of proteins needed
for motility and induction of biofilm formation (reviewed in
