Two minims of the essence of absinthe were then injected with a hypodermic

inge inserted through the vein wall into the freely flowing blood stream.
©The animal was then carefully observed and the first twitching indicating the

mmencement of a cortical discharge noted. It coincided in time with the beginning

i this method we would direct attention to the Chapter dealing specially with the
sesults thus obtained, vide p. 511.

bb 3. Extra Apparatus.

2 The apparatus used for investigating the muscular changes evoked by excitation of
tHe central nervous system was either adapted for a direct record of the character of
te muscular contraction or for ascertaining the moment of its commencement.
hen necessary the muscular contractions, whether evoked by cortical or spinal
eSoitation, were recorded by means of a spring lever, made on the pattern of that
ployed by Fick for obtaining isometric muscular effects. The muscle was attached
so that any changes in its tension were communicated to the spring, the small move-
nents of which were magnified fifty times by a lever attached to its end.
