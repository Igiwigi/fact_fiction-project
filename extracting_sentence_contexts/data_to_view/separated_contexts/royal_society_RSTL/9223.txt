2, 3, and 4 in which the cups are equal, the dependence of x on BR is
manifest, In No. 3 it is Â£5 larger than No. 2, and in No. 4 4. This is partly due to
the air's escape before the convexes being less easy as the circle described by them is
less. Such a fact is strikingly shown by the whirling experiments (paragraph 69)
which I made in earch of a minor limit for y, in which I found the resistance =30'61,
and 79 for the three respectively. This was in quiescent air ; but a similar though
much smaller effect must occur in the actual working of an anemometer. Its influence
can be obtained only by experiments, such as the present.
