30 um at 87% oil volume. However, no stable emulsion could be formed at CNC concentrations
of 1.2 and 2.4 wt.% for an 87% oil volume. For CNC-hexane emulsions (figure 6b), the oil droplet
sizes of all emulsions were all similar at any specific oil content regardless of CNC concentration.
This is due to the fact that the CNC-hexane combination could only form stable emulsions within
a narrow range of oil content, namely 60-69%. The droplet size is similar to that observed in
CNC-mineral oil emulsions at 65% of oil content, which can be ascribed to the saturated surface
coverage.
