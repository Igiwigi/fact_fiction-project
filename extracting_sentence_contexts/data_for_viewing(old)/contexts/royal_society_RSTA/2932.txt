(b) The role of the human in an algorithm-assisted discretionary decision?

An algorithm has the potential always to be more accurate than a human when circumstances

are identical to those for which the algorithm was developed, and in relation to that specific task
or question for which the algorithm was designed (although accuracy levels may not present the =
full picture in circumstances where data uncertainty is not represented [41] or where there is no : S
appetite for double-blind testing, in respect of serious offenders for instance: see Kleinberg et al.’s : 2
[53] work on comparing judicial bail decisions with an algorithmic one where crime outcomes can anal
only be observed for released defendants). Grove and Meehl argue that ‘if an equation predicts : _
that Jones will do well in dental school, and the dean’s committee, looking at the same set of facts, : 3
predicts that Jones will do poorly, it would be absurd to say, “The methods don’t compete, we Dh
use both of them”. One cannot decide both to admit and to reject the applicant; one is forced by 3
the pragmatic context to do one or the other’ [5]. It is hard to take issue with this. It is the most : B

accurate prediction that should be deployed, Grove and Meehl say, which may in many scenarios
be the algorithmic one. Where there were exceptions to the superiority of algorithmic assessment
in various studies, it was argued that had the data that were available to the clinician been made
available to the predictor, then the statistical predictor might have been equally or more accurate;
the solution was to improve the model, rather than to combine human heads with the model [5].
Humans struggle to correct patterns of ineffective or biased decisions, often due to the lack of
meaningful feedback, whereas algorithms are specifically designed to learn through error [5].
