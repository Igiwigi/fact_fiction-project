the other hand, it can be produced owing to the fact that the long head of the triceps
is not long enough to allow the upper arm to be raised to the level of the shoulder
without its pulling on the forearm, and thus producing extension at the elbow. A
more remarkable effect, however, is that which resulted when traction was directly
made on the triceps, for not only was extension at the elbow produced, but extension
of the whole extremity including the digits, all the segments of the limb being thus
brought into a straight line. The way in which this is produced is that the extensor
carpi radialis passes over two joints, viz.: the elbow and wrist, and the muscle is not
long enough to allow the elbow to be fully extended without its pulling on the meta-
carpal bones into which it is inserted, and thus producing extension of the wrist. In
like manner, the extension of the toes is due to the fact that their extensors, which
also pass over more than one joint, are too short to allow extension at the wrist
without their pulling on the bones into which they are inserted.

Gap* relates an exactly similar experience in connection with the posterior
extremity of the Frog. He found that by drawing on the ilio-psoas muscle, he
produced not only flexion of the thigh on the abdomen, but also of the leg on the
thigh, and dorsiflexion of the foot on the leg, in fact the extremity was placed
exactly in the position of a frog about to jump. The cause of this was found to be
the fact that the insufficient length of the ham-strings did not allow complete
flexion at the hip without pulling on the leg, and thus producing flexion at the
knee. Then as the tibialis anticus has its origin above the knee joint, dorsiflexion
at the ankle followed as a necessary consequence, the tibialis anticus in its turn not
