That obtained in February (S. 646)
weighed 10 gm and had only small follicles, but S. 559, obtained in March, weighed
only 7-5 gm and showed signs of follicular growth. It seems probable that at the end of the season animals in lactation ancestrus pass
directly into winter ancestrus when the young are weaned. â€˜The fact that three of
the lactating ancestrous animals contain only small follicles and that several exhibit
intense follicular degeneration supports this suggestion. The general character of the reproductive cycle in the shrew is illustrated
diagrammatically in fig. 4.
