In 8ome cases the small spheres are gradually
constricted off from the unsegmented part, and the egg may pass into a resting stage,
leaving a number of spheres only half formed (see figs. 59, 60, 63, 64). This fact
strongly indicates that there is some resistance to be overcome in the vitellus, for there
can be little doubt that the half-formed spheres contain fully developed nuelei. There are a number of other facts which point in the same direction. The first
formed cleavage furrows penetrate very slowly towards the centre of the ovum and,
in 80me cases at leasb, do nob reach the centre during the first stage of activity.
