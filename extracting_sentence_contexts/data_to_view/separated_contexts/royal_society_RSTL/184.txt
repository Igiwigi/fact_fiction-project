Read November 19, 1812. Taz fact that near sightedness most commonly commences
at an early period of life, and distant sightedness generally at
an advanced age, is universally admitted. Exceptions, how-
ever, to these rules so frequently occur, that I flatter myself
a brief statement of some of the coincident circumstances, at-
tendant on these different imperfections in vision, may not be
found wholly undeserving the attention of the Royal Society. Near sightedness usually comes on between the ages of ten
and eighteen.
