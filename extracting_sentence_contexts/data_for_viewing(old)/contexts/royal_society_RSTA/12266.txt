Combining the two series, we thus get exactly the same order from the phote

Formation of Sub-groups.

These considerations enable us to provisionally extend the classification origi!
suggested by the eye observations, as there are now many more details at
command, Further sub-division into species was attempted in the case of Group I
and Group I. was divided into the two well-defined sub-groups of nebulz and bright
line stars. In the case of the other groups, a finer division was not possible from th
available facts.

Group II. was originally divided into fifteen species from a consideration of the
observations. Since the photographs open up the blue for our investigation,
sub-division may be based on extent of the fluting-absorptions in the way which wi
be indicated.

Taking the groups in order, perhaps the most useful sub-division will be as i
cated below,
