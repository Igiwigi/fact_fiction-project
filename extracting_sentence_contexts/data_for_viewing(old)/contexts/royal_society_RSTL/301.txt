But since lime is now known, by the brilliant discoveries of
Sir H. Davy, tobe a metallic body united with oxygen, this
salt may also be viewed as a binary compound in a different
light as oxymuriate of calcium; in which case we must trans-
fer the weight of 10 oxygen to the muriatic acid, making 44,1
of oxymuriatic acid combined with 25,46 calcium. Or, lastly,
if with the same distinguished chemist, we regard it as chlorid
of calcium, its place in the scale of equivalents is the same
69,56, and the portion of matter here added to the calcium,
whether it retain its late name of oxymuriatic acid, or revert
to its original one of dephlogisticated marine acid, or assume
its new. one of chlorine, will be rightly represented by 44,1,
which expresses a bare fact without reference to any theory,
and affords the means of estimating the proportion of this
constituent in all muriatic compounds, without need of con-
troversy respecting its simple or compound nature, which may
