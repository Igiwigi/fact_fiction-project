an insulated neutral conducting disc more or less $0, in proportion to its thickness
(42.); whilst an insulated plate whose inductive power is nearly perfect, is charged to
equality with the point touched (36.). ;

I have found in the course of some recent inquiries that the attractive force
between an electrified plane surface and an insulated disc of inconsiderable thick-
ness, in a neutral state, is frequently in an inverse ratio of the distance between the
two planes ; the induction of which such a disc is susceptible being extremely limited ;
that on increasing the thickness the force also increases up to a certain point, where,
under the given conditions of distance, quantity of electricity, and the like, the induc-
tion on the opposed surface remains nearly the same.

46. These facts, together with those already mentioned in the course of these inquiries,
render it highly probable that the quantity of electricity taken up from the surface of
a charged body by a small insulated disc of inconsiderable thickness may be greatly
influenced by the position of the point of application, independently of the quantity of
