nucellus until they are met by the descending pollen-tubes, neither Hooker nor
SrraspurGeR has thrown any light upon their development. Fertilisation has not
been seen. Karsren,* working on material obtained from STRASBURGER, saw a
number of prothallial tubes in the nucellus. In most of these one nucleus was
observed, but in two cases he saw three lying in a row, one behind the other. He
remarks that the three nuclei in each case were of about the same size as those
which were solitary in other tubes. The nucellus was “ bliischenformig,” containing a
rather large nucleolus. In a few cases he states that the tubes had grown completely
through the nucellus, and penetrated into the micropyle. These were regarded as
abnormal, and their remarkable behaviour was thought to be due to the fact that
pollination had not oceurred.

The later stages now described may be compared with the development of the
prothallus and sexual nuclei of Gnetum, especially of G. Gaemon. In the latter
speciest the free-nuclear condition, in which there is a well-developed central
vacuole, is followed by the appearance of cell-walls in the lower portion, while
the conditions still remain unchanged in the micropylar end. The cellular chalazal
region is sterile and nutritive in function. No cell-walls are formed in the upper part
before fertilisation ; its nuclei lie free in the cytoplasm ; they are apparently alike in
every respect, and all of them potentially sexual. Some are fertilised. The
remaining vacuole then becomes filled by the up-growth of the nutritive prothallium
in and at the expense of which the development of the embryo proceeds, If
