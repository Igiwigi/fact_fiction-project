as the Cosheston Beds and the Foreland Grits, have not, as yet, yielded determinable
plants, though the general type of the fragmentary plant remains in them is similar.
The following brief discussion can therefore be based on the Senni Beds flora.

Without undue repetition of the information afforded by the list of plants in the
Senni Beds (p. 134) and the descriptive accounts of these, the interesting composition
of the flora may be pointed out. It mostly consists of vascular plants which there is

every reason to regard as terrestrial. The largest plant is Drepanophycus, remains of
which were fertile and also provided new facts regarding the branching of the pre-
sumably basal region. Psilophyton, recorded as cf. P. princeps, is represented by remains
of large size with short spines and has shown a new type of fructification. Dawsonites
is fairly well represented but has added nothing to our knowledge. These three forms of
relatively advanced vascular plants are of some stratigraphical importance. A second
interesting element in the Senni Beds flora comprises those leafless plants that bear in
various ways stalked sporangia which appear more or less clearly reniform, dehiscing
along the convex margin, and resemble the type of sporangium first known from
Zosterophyllum myretonianum. Such plants may be collectively spoken of as Zostero-
phyllaceae (Krausel 1938). The group includes Gosslingia, as yet peculiar to the Senni
Beds, with sporangia borne on the edge of finer divisions of the sympodial branch system.
It further includes terminal spikes of tangentially extended sporangia which are referred
to Zosterophyllum. Some of the spikes are radially symmetrical and closely resemble
