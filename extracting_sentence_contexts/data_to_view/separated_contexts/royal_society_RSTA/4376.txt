As recently demonstrated by Davis [67] heterogeneous catalysts, many of them Bronsted-acid
or Lewis-acid single-site ones, offer considerable scope for the synthesis of commodity polymers
from biomass. Apart from the use of glucose as a starting material, which can be conveniently
isomerized, as shown by Davis, to fructose the dehydration of lactic acid opens up new routes
to acrylic acid and acrylonitrile, which are currently produced [37] in environmentally aggressive
ways. An interesting reaction starting from fructose is again its catalytic dehydration at single-site
nanoporous solids to yield 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, which, in turn, produces a convenient path
that leads to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid for the synthesis of polyethylene furanoate or purified
terephthalic acid, which is used in massive amounts to form polyethylene terephthalate, that
currently is synthesized from petrochemicals.

(c) The importance of catalysis in generating fuel and other forms of energy

In the BP Energy Outlook 2030, several important facts (predictions) are announced. First, it
predicts an annual rate of increase in renewable energy use in the period 2010-2030 of 8%. Second,
it estimates that transport fuel in 2030 will comprise of oil (87%), biofuels (7%), gas (4%), coal (1%)
and electricity (1%).
