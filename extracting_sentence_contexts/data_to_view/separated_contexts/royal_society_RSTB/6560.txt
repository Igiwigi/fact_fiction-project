65, Plate 41; fig. 93, Plate 47 in specimens H.N.,
H.Q. and H.X. respectively. Taking all these facts into consideration I think that it must be agreed that the
epithelial bodies in Ornithorhynchus are detached and degenerated portions of what were
at one time more prominent cusps. In this respect it is interesting to notice how the
main cusps of the teeth of Ornithorhynchus remain embedded in the enamel organ and
well separated at their apices from the external enamel epithelium as compared with
the condition found, for example, in the marsupials where the cusps bulge out the
surface of the enamel organ and delete or dislodge the stellate reticulum which originally
lay over them (see figs. in BoLK’s paper (1928)).


MORPHOLOGY OF THE TEETH OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS 415

In no sense can the epithelial bodies be considered as representing vestigial remains
of a milk dentition.
