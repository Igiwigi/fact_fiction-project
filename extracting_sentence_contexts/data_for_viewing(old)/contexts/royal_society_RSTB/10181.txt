decrease in consumer growth rates and final consumer biovo-
lume with increasing C:N ratios, which could also be
observed in our experiment. Apparently, compensatory feed-
ing by consumers was not sufficient to completely
compensate for low food quality by increasing their food
uptake, which resulted in lower growth rates and thus
lower final biovolume. This negative effect on population
growth, however, was not large enough in the time frame
investigated to offset population grazing rates (see above).
This effect was consistent across all consumer combinations.
The intensified effects of low food quality on consumer
growth and production at high temperature can be explained
by the fact that all biochemical reactions, including protein
synthesis, are influenced by temperature by increasing the
mean kinetic energy of molecules [42]. Our results are sup-
ported by the findings of Persson et al. [33] and
Wojewodzic et al. [34], who found that the negative effect
of low food quality (high C: P) on growth rates of daphnid
and rotifer consumers, respectively, increased with tempera-
ture. Persson ef al. [33] found no evidence of Daphnia P
limitation at the lowest temperature (10Â°C), indicating that
enzyme kinetics or other measures of food quality were
more important for somatic Daphnia growth than the
demands for P to RNA and protein. By contrast, McFeeters
& Frost [43] demonstrated that the effects of high C:P on
