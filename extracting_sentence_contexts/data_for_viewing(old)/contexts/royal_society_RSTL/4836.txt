rom Dr. Exman's table 29'21 as the mean pressure of the dry air at the equator, the

observations in the Pagoda show a difference of gaseous pressure between the equator
and the high latitudes (—56? to— 675) of the sonuthern hemisphere amounting to
0:28 inch; the observations in the Pagoda were however exclusiyely in the summer
months, when the pressures are generally less than on the mean of the whole year.
Owing to the increase in the elastic force of the aqueous vapour in the warmer re-
gions of the globe, the difference of barometric pressure between the equator and the
high latitudes (taking the data from Dr. Ermax's table on the one hand, and from the
observations in the Pagoda on the other) amounts to 089 inch.

As the facts shown by these observations are curions, and must be interesting to
meteorologists, it is hoped that the Royal Society will not consider this paper

unworthy of their acceptance. |
