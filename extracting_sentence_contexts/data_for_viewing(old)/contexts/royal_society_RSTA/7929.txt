* These functions were first explicitly defined with reference to group characters by Scuur in his Disserta -
tion (“ Ueber einer Klasse von Matrizen,” Berlin (1901)). The fact that the quotient of |a,\**"~4| by|a,"—4,
which we shall show to be equal to the Scuur-function, could be written as a determinant |ha,—a+el ,» Was,
however, known and used (Jacosr, see Muir, “ Theory of Determinants, ” vol. 1, p. 341 (1906), Trupt,
see Murr, vol. 3, p. 135 (1920) ; Narcetspacu, see Murr, vol. 3, p. 144), and Kosrka (Kostka, see Murr,
vol. 4, p. 145 (1923)), ealculateda series of tablesconnecting these functions with other symmetric functions.
These tables may readily be deduced from tables of characters, as will be shown. Scuur gives the formula
for expressing them in terms of the products 8,, and conversely (p. 52), and expresses them as determinants
with elements h, (p. 47) and a, (p. 50). He also demonstrates other properties, showing relations between
S-functions and symmetric functions of the form X 2,2". . -

+ It is with some hesitation that we have used h, in this sense, owing to the similarity to the symbol h,
used for an entirely different purpose. We have retained both symbols, however, because each is a used
and accepted terminology, hoping that, as we remark upon the distinction here, confusion to the reader
