Comparison with the finite-
element solution shows that this is actually a very good approximation for all n > 2. :

We proceed by integrating the equations [2

after using the boundary conditions for x and y at § = 0. We still have two unknown lengths L and Lc, but we have two constraints to enforce: (i) at
§ =1 the beam must lie on the line defined by equation (3.3); and (ii) the total length of the beam
is known from inextensibility, 2L, + L =22R/n. Note that the left-hand side of this constraint does
not take into account the error in length due to the approximations for cos @ and sin @ used to find
x and y, which are, in fact, the largest sources of error in this approximation. These two constraints
can be used to determine L, and L and we find that
(x R/n — rtan(z/n)) tan(27/n) and Le= mR_L

c =

n/n — $(1 — 322/2n?) tan(2x/n) no 2

In the limit 1 > 00, we find that L— 4n(R — r)/3, which only makes sense if the allowed
solutions for increasing n have (R —r) > 0 faster than n — oo. We use this approximation to
determine the critical buckling radius as a function of n.
