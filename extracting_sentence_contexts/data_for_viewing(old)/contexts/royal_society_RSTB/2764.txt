ewes,” points in the same direction, although the returns submitted to him do not
show any proof of this except for the Dorset breed. For these “there is some
evidence that in unfavourable tupping seasons, during great heat and scarcity of
green food, the young ewes are more likely to be affected than the older ewes,
and less likely to be in a satisfactory breeding condition.”

Of more doubtful bearing on this subject is Scorr’s statement, already quoted, that
ewes from which an extra number of lambs have been raised by flushing one year are
less prolific at the subsequent lambing, or the fact referred to in the section of this
paper on the * CEstrous Cycle,” that those Limestone sheep which produce lambs twice
during one year are barren in the year followiag, Such facts as these are usually
ascribed to general strain on the reproductive system, but when this strain is said to
cause subsequent barrenness (as distinct from abortion or “ slipping lamb”), L would
suggest that the barrenness is due to a premature but partial ripening of the
Graatian follicles succeeded by an unusual amount of follicular atresia.*

The general practical conclusion to be drawn from the above considerations is that
it is better to keep the ewes in fair thriving condition, as continuously as possible,
than to submit them to an unnatural process of stimulation by “flushing” shortly
before and during the sexual season, while maintaining them on mere sustenance diet
at other times of the year,

There is another point of some practical importance which deserves notice. It is
