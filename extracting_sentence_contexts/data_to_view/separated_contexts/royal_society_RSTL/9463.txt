(m.) Thus far, then, I have detailed all the facts which I have been able to collect
with reference to the phenomena of artificial rhythm as produced by different kinds of
constant, stimulation. Tb will nob be forgotten that the interest attaching to these
facts arises from the bearing which they have on the theory of natural rhythm. My

belief is that hitherto the theory of rhythm as due to ganglia has attributed far too
much importance to the ganglionie as distinguished from the contractile tissnes, and I
have founded this belief principally on the facts which have been already stated and
which certainly prove, at least, this much : that after the removal of their centres of
spontaneity the contractile tissnes of the Meduse display a marked and persistent
tendeney to break into rhythmic action whenever they are supplied with a constant
stimulus of feeble intensity.
