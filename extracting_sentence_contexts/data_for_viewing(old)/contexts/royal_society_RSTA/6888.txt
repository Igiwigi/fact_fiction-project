4. NUMERICAL INTEGRATION OF THE Z, FUNCTIONS

Notwithstanding that these Z integrals can be reduced to standard mathematical functions,
we have found that the alternative of numerical integration in (9) is often more convenient
in practice. This arises from the fact that the geometrical dependence of the integrand upon
the variable of integration is of the smoothly varying form shown in figure 2. Consequently,
any of the standard integration rules (Bickley 1939) may be employed. It turns out that for
large values of ¢ (frequently as low as ¢>3r), the integrand is effectively zero.
