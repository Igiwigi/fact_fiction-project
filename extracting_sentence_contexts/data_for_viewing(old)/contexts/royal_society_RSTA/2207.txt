where we are slightly modifying Ramanujan’s notation as was done in [14, Ch. 2].

Now (4.3) is, in fact, quite extraordinary, and it is plausible that Ramanujan would have seen
this immediately.

Namely, if q= e2riM/n with (M,n)=1 and n odd, then it is clear that no factor in the
denominator of $3(—q) is ever equal to zero because there are no solutions, j, to the congruence

(2) + 1)2M = n(mod 2n).

If, on the other hand, n 4 0(mod 4), then no factor in the denominator of $3(—q) is ever equal
to zero because there are no solutions, j, of

2j2M = n(mod 2n).
