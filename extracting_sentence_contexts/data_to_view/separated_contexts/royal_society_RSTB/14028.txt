This neuroplasticity effect may explain the

dichotomy in unconscious processing found between healthy

subjects compared to subjects with blindsight. If we consider 4. Method
the speed with which mimicry happened combined with the
fact that participants were not instructed to react to the
stimuli in any way, it could be argued that the occurrence
of spontaneous mimicry (the tendency to smile in response
to seeing smiling faces) suggests that healthy subjects also
engage in ‘unconscious’ processing of emotional stimuli. The CFC experiment aimed to replicate and extend the results of
a blindsight study by Tamiett et al. [22] while measuring facial
mimicry and pupil mimicry during trust games [7,8]. While the decision to trust is more cognitive and potentially (a) Participants

conscious, the tendency to smile is more implicit.
