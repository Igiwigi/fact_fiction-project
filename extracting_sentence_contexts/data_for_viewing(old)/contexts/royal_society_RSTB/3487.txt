CALAMITES (CALAMOCLADUS SECTION). 59

shoot of Equisetum limosum, in which the stele in the upper internodes possessed
a triarch structure, being composed of three collateral bundles surrounded by
a common endodermis. This stage may be compared with that of the young stem
just described. Again, in the same species and in F. hiemale “ the central cylinder of
the first shoot makes its appearance as an unbroken tube of reticulate tracheides.
There are no typical protoxylem elements, although the internal tracheides are formed
first.” This type of structure is almost exactly what we get in the Calamite twigs.
Prof. Jerrrey’s description might, in fact, have been written about the structure
seen in section $900. Another comparison can be drawn between the Calamite
twigs and the young Equisetum stems with reference to the number of leaves in the
whorls, In the former this is usually four or six, but from impression-specimens
we see that the number was often much greater in thicker stems. A similar state
of affairs exists in the Equisetum stems. The early leaf-whorls may have only two
or three members, while this number becomes considerably increased in the mature
stem.

The Leaves.

The internodes of the twigs vary somewhat in length, but in most of the
specimens described below they are about 1 mm. long. The leaves of successive
