The temperature of the hot water will be practically constant, but it is advisable
to take the readings in case of alteration. The calorimeter thermometer may be read
till it reaches 20° C.

It will be convenient to explain here the reason for cooling the ball 6° or 7° before
starting. In the preceding remarks no notice was taken of the fact that there will
be radiation to or from the surface of the ball unless the latter is at the same tempe-
ture as its surroundings. It would be impossible to allow for this by calculation, as
the surface is altered before every test by being heated while the wire is being
soldered into the ball. For the purpose of getting rid of the necessity of allowing
for this radiation, the ball is cooled down.
