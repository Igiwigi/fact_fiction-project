whose points correspond to points of I, near its node. Every line of o meets d; so
that every cubic curve on I,, which corresponds to a line of w, will go through the node
and touch II there. Thus every quadric which touches II at O will meet such a cubic
curve in two coincident points at O and in four other points; and the section of I,
by the quadric will be represented on w by the line d repeated and by a quartic curve
with double points at A,, A,. Now <A is composed, in this case, of sections of I, by
all quadries touching II at 0; so that A’ consists of quartic curves having double points
at Ay, Ag, each of these curves being augmented by the line Ag Ay As repeated; and any
H-net of these leads to an H-system of quadrics in which the general ®-surface has a node at O.

Four quadrics which touch two given primes at given points of the primes meet in
general in no further point ; but if each prime goes through the point of contact of the
other, the quadrics do intersect in further points and, in fact, touch the plane of inter-
section of the primes along the line joining the points of contact. It follows then that
although it is not possible to have an H-system of quadrics which all touch two given
primes at two given general points of them, yet if the point of contact of each prime
lies in the other, such systems may arise. Hence arises the next type of ®-surface.

4.3. The Surface 1,—We shall now consider the surface of intersection of two quadrics
which touch a given plane o along a given line 4 lying in ; and this surface we shall
call I,. We have already mentioned that at some two points D,, D, of a the two
quadrics have the same tangent solids II, and Il, respectively ; thus I, has nodes at
D, and D, and the four lines of I, through either of these consist of the line » repeated
and two other lines. Projecting I, from 4 on to the plane a, we see that two triads of
the five fundamental points, A,, Ay, A; and Ag, Ay, As, say, lie on two lines dj, dy of the
