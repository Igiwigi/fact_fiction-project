£ Z00n invariably enters the tissues with its thicker or body portion directed forwards,

S inherent as such in its organic composition. It may yet be true, nevertheless, that
the passing of the spermatozoon through the substance of the envelopes to the vitel-
lary membrane may be indirectly aided by the endosmic action of the envelopes.
But this aid does not consist of any imbibing property in the tissues. It appears to
be simply of a negative character, and to be the result of a decrease of density in the
tissues, which, through their imbibition of water, and consequent expansion, are
caused to offer less and less resistance to the propulsive force of the spermatozoon.
This I believe is the proper explanation of the fact of penetration by this body.
But although penetration be not caused by the endosmic action of the envelopes,

it may yet be thought to be induced by some attractive power in the substance of
the yelk itself; and that, therefore, the entrance of the spermatozoon may be as much
due to the egg as to any power of motion in the penetrating body. An accident has
enabled me to test the validity of this surmise.

I had promised to show the fact of penetration to a friend, but circumstances pre-
