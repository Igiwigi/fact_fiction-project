Ever since the are was first assumed to have a back E.M.F., speculation has been
rife as to its cause and its location in the are. So long as the value assigned to it
was of the order of 40 volts, and it was supposed to be located only at the crater
surface, there was great difficulty in offering any consistent explanation of it. It
remains, therefore, to consider whether the new facts set forth in this paper render
the matter more susceptible of a satisfactory explanation. So far as the resistance of the are is concerned, there seem to be no difficulties, the
known relations between the size and shape of the vapour column, the size of the
craters, the current, and the are length. explain the observed changes in resistance
when the two latter variables are altered.
