The statistics dealing with the matter are given
on pp. 79 and 81, while Curves 13, 16, and 17 record the results graphically. It may,
however, be pointed out that the curves would definitely harmonise with the view that
the inflorescence axis in each case represents a cicinnus with the branch on the same
side constantly strengthened ; and this result is not without interest. But apart from
the fact that other interpretations are quite possible (such as leaf-displacements) it is
probable that the longitudinal symmetry of inflorescences is, at least, often of a kind
different from that of vegetative axes. Ampelopsis hederacea. (Curves 25, 26.)
