Comparing Tables XVIII. and V., we see that in both the amplitude of the
Z 24-hour term varies much with the season; but whereas in the case of P it is
2 conspicuously largest in winter, that is precisely the season when it is least in B.
3 Table XVIIL shows apparently a secondary minimum for ¢, in summer, but the
2 smallest value in summer is 13 times the value in January. The fundamental nature
‘@ of the difference between the annual variations of ¢, in B and P ean in fact be seen at
a glance on comparing the heavier and lighter full line curves in fig. 3, which repre-
sent the monthly values expressed as fractions of the arithmetic mean,

The phase angles a, in Table XVIII. show erratic variations in the winter months,
which are very probably fictitious. Judging by the seasonal values, «, is larger in
winter than in summer, but the difference is small compared to the corresponding
difference in Table V. In all the seasons «, is much less for B than for P, in other
words, the hour of maximum for P is much the earlier.

§ 31. In the case of the 12-hour term the differences between the annual variations
in the amplitudes for B and P are comparatively small. These variations are
illustrated by the dotted curves in fig. 3.

The phase angles « in Table XVIII. show fairly similar characteristics to those
exhibited in Table V. In both cases the seasonal variation is comparatively small.
‘The P phase angle is invariably the larger, 7.e., the maxima in the 12-hour curve are
again earlier for P than for B; the difference in time is however on the average only
