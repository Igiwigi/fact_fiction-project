Again, the low birth-rate during
the autumn shows that the continuity of the cool weather spell is not favourable to
conception, while the first marked increase of sunlight and warmth in the spring is
clearly associated with a renewal of reproductive activity, demonstrated by the
sudden increase of the birth-rate in November—December. Thus there is substantial reason for the view that marked stimulation of the
reproductive system of individuals as a whole in Cuba is closely associated with
climatic changes year by year, and there can, I think, be no doubt that climate has
a pronounced effect on reproductive activity ; but such effect is not due to the results
brought about either by a fall or by a rise of temperature only, it is essentially
governed by the resultant of the various forces which are induced by a marked change
of climate within certain limits. Climate, however, is not the only factor which influences the breeding seasons,
that there must be other causes is clear from the fact that there are no special
climatic conditions which would appear to be sufficient to account for the unusually
vigorous spring breeding season in 1905 (vide birth-rate for November—December,
1905). 2qQ2



300 MR. W. HEAPE ON THE PROPORTION OF THE SEXES

Tt would require an intimate knowledge of the normal conditions of the country
and of the inhabitants, to compare with the conditions prevailing in 1905, in order
that one should be enabled to advance with any degree of plausibility a satisfactory
reason for this particular period of virility ; such knowledge I have not got, but
I suggest with some confidence it is to be found by a study of the comparative
quantity or quality of the food then available.
