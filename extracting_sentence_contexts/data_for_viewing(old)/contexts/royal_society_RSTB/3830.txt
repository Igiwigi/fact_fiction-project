In some of these sections cut without decalcification, the material had previously
been stained in bulk with borax carmine—the tubes in the enamel were strongly
stained with the carmine and were clearly relieved against the more delicately stained
enamel substance (Plate 25, fig. 6, a, 5).

It will be noticed that the turns of the spiral are very unequal, in some places
being very close and in others widely extended. These turns are frequently con-
siderably wider than the enamel prisms and appear quite inconsistent with the
view that the tubes are within the prisms. In several places they can be seen
to project from the margin of the section (Plate 25, fig. 6, ¢) and their appearance
in this situation is highly suggestive of a very considerable amount of rigidity.

I think the appearances in these sections are only consistent with the fact that they
are winding around the prisms in the interprismatic substance.

The most marked peculiarity noticeable in marsupial tooth germs is, as pointed
out by Mr. Cartes Tomes, the great development of the Tomes’ processes of
the ameloblasts, and in the sections now under consideration they do not show the
dragging out seen in decalcified sections, where they are often reduced in many
places to a mere thread. In their undisturbed relations they are seen to bridge
across a distinct interval between the lower ends of the ameloblasts (or the inner
ameloblastic membrane) and the forming enamel. In these preparations, which
are mounted in Farrant’s solution, there seems to have been very little lateral
shrinking of the Tomes’ processes, which are in some places nearly as wide as the
ameloblasts, but no doubt some shrinking has taken place and the intervals between
