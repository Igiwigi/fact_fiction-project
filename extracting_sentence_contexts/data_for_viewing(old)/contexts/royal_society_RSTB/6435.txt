I must now retrace my steps and consider briefly the part played by the anterior
lobe of the pituitary. Hrapr (1905), some thirty years ago, put forward the theory
that some substance is formed in the body in small amounts that is responsible for both
growth and reproduction, pointing out that, broadly speaking, reproduction begins
when growth ceases or at least slows down. This hypothetical substance he called
tentatively the “generative ferment’’. _Hammonp (1925) adopted the same idea and
used it to explain certain phenomena which had been produced experimentally.
For instance, FoA (1901) found that immature ovaries when grafted into a previously
odphorectomized adult underwent a rapid development in the mature somatic
environment. Conversely, it had been shown that adult ovaries when transplanted
into young immature females lost their adult histological characters and had no
perceptible endocrine activity. The mechanism of compensatory hypertrophy of the
ovary was similarly explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary does
not add to the number of mature follicles in the animal, the three ovaries together

* According to ZUCKERMAN (1936, A), the actual menstrual discharge is associated with a fall in
the oestrin content, but there is a lag in the effect of 7 to 14 days represented by the period between

ovulation and the beginning of the discharge. This succession of phases, he claims, can be imitated
experimentally by injection of oestrin into oéphorectomized monkeys.

producing about the same number of follicles as is ordinarily produced by two (see
