Figure 2. Estimated impacts of main climate drivers on cereal (i.e. barley, oats, triticale, rye, wheat) yield anomalies in four European regions: Northern Europe (a),
Eastern Europe (b), Western Europe (c) and Southern Europe (d). Grey curves correspond to the effects of each cereal crop estimated independently by random
forests based on historical times series.
