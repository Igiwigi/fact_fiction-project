Recall that T(t, x) = (e'40T )(x), see (1.4); from the previous facts we have

d(T — Tg) = («A + Lo)(T — Tg) dt +) uj VT awl.
id

The mild formulation of this identity, furthermore applied in a weak sense to a smooth test
function ¢ with compact support in D, is

(@, TW) — To(t)) = >> i, (eeg, 4: vT()) awl,
id

where (.,-) is the inner product in L?(D) and we have also used the fact that the semigroup e('-5)4o

is self-adjoint. By the isometry formula for Ité integrals,
t 2
E[ (6,7 - Tol) ]=>> I, E [let ee, uj VT()) | ds.
is

We have (we write T;(x) for T(s, x) and ¢;,5(x) for (e-9)404)(x) to shorten notations)
