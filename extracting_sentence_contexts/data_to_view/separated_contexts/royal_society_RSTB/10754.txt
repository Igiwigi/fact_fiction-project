In Old World monkeys and apes, the
intensity of coloration of glabrous skin is under hormonal
control and is considered a sign of fertility in females and
competitive ability in males [12-14]. The genetic and developmental processes that produce
the complex topographical arrangements of coloration on
the face, trunk and limbs are not well understood [15], and
are still mostly a matter of conjecture. The fact that many pat-
terns follow presumed pathways of migration of the neural
crest-derived melanocytes into the face and trunk during
development warrants further study [5]. Humans are distinguished from their non-human rela-
tives by an absence of most fur and an almost complete
lack of regional patterning in hair coloration, except for
male facial hair in some populations [16]. Most of the surface
area of human skin is covered with almost invisible vellus
hairs and is often referred to as ‘functionally naked’.
