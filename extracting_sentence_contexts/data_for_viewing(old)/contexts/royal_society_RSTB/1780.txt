2. Regeneration of nerve fibres in the peripheral segment, while still separated from
the central segment.

The portions of nerves examined show very clearly, not only that in regeneration
the young fibres are produced both in the central and in the peripheral segment, but
also that reunion of the ends is not an essential to the production of young fibres in
the peripheral segment (Plate 7, figs. 2 and 4; Plate 8, fig. 2). This independent
origin of new fibres in the peripheral segment, without previous reunion with the
central end, first observed and described by Paturpzaux and VuLpran (38, 39), has
been opposed by almost all who have since made a study of regeneration of nerves ;
and their opinion was also greatly weakened by the fact that VuLPrAN (77, 86) him-
self withdrew from his former position. MircHent (80), and recently Bowxpy (146)
have found in the examination of portions removed from the peripheral segments of
un-united divided nerves, that many newly formed nerve fibres are there present.
The opponents of this view give various explanations of the results of these observers.
Some hold that PatumEaux and VULPIAN mistook products of degeneration for young
fibres ; Scuurr (41), and Amprosorr (43) that their results were only to be got in
very young animals; while Ranvier (102), again, thinks that they did observe the
peripheral segment regenerated, but that they had failed to observe certain strands
of tissue between the central and peripheral ends, through which the peripheral
segment had been regenerated. He supports this allegation by an observation of his
own, where a central segment lying separate from its peripheral, was connected to it
by a membrane having the appearance of connective tissue, but which contained
