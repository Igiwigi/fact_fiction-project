C. JACKSON: INVESTIGATIONS ON

Other writers have proposed various modifications of the theory, in particular, Gans*
allowed for the effect of the mutual interactions of the molecules. He found that if the
molecule possesses a figure axis the substance will be paramagnetic, but the dependence
on temperature of the susceptibility at low temperatures given by the theory is not in
good agreement with the experimental facts. Foixt has extended the theory of Wxiss by considering the effect of the introduction
of the following ideas (1) a molecular field equal to mz (Â¢ = magnetisation), in
which has in general different values along the principal axes of the crystal and (2)
there exists a potential energy which is a function of the direction in the crystal. An
account of this theory, as far as it concerns the principal susceptibilities of crystals, will
be found in Part IT.
