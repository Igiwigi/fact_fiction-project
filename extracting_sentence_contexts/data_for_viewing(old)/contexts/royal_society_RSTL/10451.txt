The method of using these tables.

The scale numbers given in the firs} column of the tables are linear meagurements
of the positions of the lines in the different prismatic spectra, photographed copies of
which have been published in the Journal of the Chemical Society, vol. xli., p. 84.
They serve two purposes, first as a check upon the wave-lengths quoted, and secondly
as a means of identifying the lines. Suppose, for instance, I wish to identify the line
in the indium spectrum which is mapped as double, it will be seen that the least
refrangible line stands at nearly 16, and the next at as nearly as possible 40 on the
scale. Applying an ivory rule to the photograph (oc. cit.), the rule being divided
into hundredths of an inch, 80 that the numbers 16 and 40 correspond with the two
least refrangible lines, it will be found that a very strong line stands at 120, and
it is this which appears as double on the map, though the fact cannot be seen by
examination of the printed photographs. A. reference to the table will show that at
119-31 and 119-68 on the scale there are two lines with wave-lengths 3257'8 and
3255-5, the former of which does not appear in solutions containing 4th per cent. of
the metal, while the latter continues visible even when only x}gth per cent. is present.
The tables of scale numbers and wave-lengths are of little value, however, without the
maps. As an illustration of the way in which the maps may be used, let us suppose
that a sample of pyrites cinder is being examined for copper and silyer. It will be seen
at a glance that the most persistent group of characteristic lines in the spectrum of
silver lies between wave-lengths 2300 and 2500, those lines sibuated in a position
