quently such experiments are inconclusive.

5, Carbonic acid was introduced into an empty bladder that had been previously
well moistened with warm water. When the bladder was distended about one third,
its neck was firmly tied with a waxed thread, by which it was suspended in the centre
of a receiver of an air-pump. When the pump was worked, the bladder increased in
volume, and in a few seconds was much distended. Nearly the whole of the atmo-
spheric air was exhausted from the receiver, but the bladder, though apparently very
tense, did not burst, neither did it decrease in size. A shallow glass vessel contain-
ing barytic water had been placed under the same receiver, but the transparency of
this was not affected. Hydrogen was then transmitted into the receiver, and the
bladder was reduced to the same size as when first snspended under it ; but, after an
interyal of four hours, it had hecome perfectly flaceid. In fact, there was scarcely a
particle of carbonic acid left in it, and the barytic water within the receiver contained
a quantity of carbonate of baryta.

6. The double-necked bottle was carefully filled with pure hydrogen, and about
five ounces of blood were drawn into it from a vein in the arm, in the same manner
as in experiment 3. Both the orifices of the bottle were then closed, and the blood
and the hydrogen well agitated together, After this the lower orifice was immersed
in distilled water, and the bottle left undisturbed for nearly an hour, to allow the
hydrogen to act on the blood. The orifice of the descending tube was then immersed
in barytic water, the lower valve was opened, and the whole apparatus put under the
receiver of the air-pump. When the pump was used, the gas which was over the
blood passed through the barytic water, and immediately rendered it turbid. This
