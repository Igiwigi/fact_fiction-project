throughout the atmosphere. However, when comparing the two magnetic models, we clearly
see the influence of magnetic field orientation on the propagation of the IGWs. The model with a
predominantly horizontal field reveals a similar behaviour as the non-magnetic case, showing
negative phase-difference throughout the atmosphere, meaning that the IGWs propagate
upwards as if the magnetic fields were absent. For the model with a predominantly vertical field,
on the other hand, this is not the case as the phase difference here is positive for heights above
z=0.4Mm, revealing quite a contrasting behaviour compared to the non-magnetic and the model
with horizontal field. The IGWs in the vertical field case are seen to propagate downwards in the
higher layers.
The change in behaviour around z = 0.4Mm can be understood by looking again at figure 3.
We see here that the magnetic fields in the two models are quite similar in regions between the
average tr = 1 surface and average 6 = 1 surface which is around z = 0.5 Mm. We believe that the
similarity in both simulations in terms of wave propagation is due to the fact that the dynamics
of the waves below the plasma f = 1 surface is not dominated by the magnetic fields, but by the
thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere. The thermal properties of the atmosphere in the
near-surface layers are similar in the two cases of Sun-v100 and Sun-h100. In the low plasma Â£
layers, however, the waves see a different magnetic field orientation between the two magnetic
models as they propagate. This is an indication of the mode coupling that occurs in the presence
of magnetic fields of different inclination as described by Newington & Cally [3,4].
