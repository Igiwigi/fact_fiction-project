potential bottlenecks that may impact future trends. Analysis of the system capacity versus
distance is used to identify bottlenecks and to understand the network scaling properties. nee)

2. Energy in optical systems :3

Energy impacts optical systems through several dimensions. The first is the energy use itself, a
which adds to operational costs and has environmental implications. Much effort has been reed
focused recently on sustainable communication approaches, for instance using renewable energy .
resources to power up network equipment. Increase in energy usage translates to a larger thermal
load. In fact, in recent years, optical equipment has become constrained by thermal density limits
in central offices, in the case of air cooling [4]. Similar to electronic systems, a new generation of
devices based on optical technology must fit within the same electrical power budget per shelf
allotted to the equipment it replaces. The alternative is to increase footprint, which adds to cost.
Likewise, the use of optics in edge equipment such as computers that constantly demand higher
data rates is constrained by thermal limits.

In recent years, there has been concern about the overall energy use of information and
communication technologies (ICTs) [10]. Estimates of global electricity consumption and carbon
footprint place ICTs at roughly 5% and 2%, respectively [11,12]. These numbers of course depend
on which technologies are counted within the broad classification of ICT, which typically includes
computers as well as network equipment. Networks are a significant fraction and are reported
to be growing fastest (10% annually) [11]. The energy associated with network infrastructure is
