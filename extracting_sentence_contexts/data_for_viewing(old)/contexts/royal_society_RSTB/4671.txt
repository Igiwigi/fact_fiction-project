(b) The groove of the dorsal fin-spine of Acanthias vulgaris.

(c) ‘The groove of the spine of Cestracion philippi.

(d) There is some evidence of a similar structure in connection with the spine of
Chimera monstrosa.

2. The examination of fossil fin-spines suggests that they also in the fresh state
had a glandular structure of a similar nature.

3. A study of the nature of fish venoms most readily undertaken with the venom
of Trachinus draco, establishes the facts that the venom is both neurotoxic and
hemolytic in its action ; the latter character seems to be of the greater importance.
The hemolytic action of fresh unfiltered venom takes place without the addition of
heated serum or lecithin: nevertheless filtered glycerinated venom requires the
presence of heated serum or a solution of lecithin in order that hzemolysis may take
place.

4, Wounds envenomed by fish poisons are best treated by the hypodermic injection
of 2—5 per cent. solutions of permanganate of potash or 1 per cent. solution of
chloride of gold into the site of the punctured wound.
