+ In one experiment eighty-four measures of the venous blood of the Sheep were agitated with ten of ni-
trous gas over mercury; the whole of the gas was absorbed : twelye of oxygen were added ; on agitation again
there was no further absorption,

the blood, not capable of being extracted by the air-pump, and yet capable of enter-
ing into combination with nitrous gas, and which exists in largest proportion in arte-
rial blood ? Unless this conclusion is adopted, it must be supposed either that the
nitrous gas which disappears is decomposed, or that it combines directly with the
red particles ; neither of which suppositions is well supported by facts. The cir-
cumstance that no azote is disengaged, is not fayourable to the idea that the nitrous
gas is decomposed ; and the difference of effect in the instances of venous and arte-
rial blood, and, after and before agitation with oxygen, is not in accordance with the
notion of direct combination. I may mention another fact which segems to have the
same bearing : serum, which does not absorb oxygen, I find also does not absorb ni-
trous gas, excepting in about the proportion in which water absorbs it : and, further,
in corroboration, I may mention, that as blood putrefies, whether arterial or venous,
its power of absorbing nitrous gas diminishes ; and that it is also diminished by be-
ing agitated with phosphuretted hydrogen. Thus the arterial blood of a Sheep, which
before agitation with phosphuretted hydrogen absorbed 45:3 per cent. of nitrous gas,
after agitation with it absorbed 7:4 per cent. less ; and, after it had become putrid, it
absorbed twenty per cent. less. According to my observations, arterial blood does
