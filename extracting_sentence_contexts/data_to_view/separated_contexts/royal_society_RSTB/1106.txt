We would pass from this part of our subject, since our knowledge of the process
of secondary degeneration has shown that in the arrangement of the experiment al]
we do is to observe at one (the spinal) end of a column of fibres the changes evoked
by stimulating these fibres at the other (corona radiata) end, were it not that the
above effect is capable of modification in a manner which demands consideration. Moreover, we wish to emphasise the fact, that in its simplest form the corona radiata
effect, as observed in the cord, is an example of the application of the galvanometric
method to the determination of directly continuous nerve tracts in the central
nervous system. This, as we shall see later in dealing with the spinal cord itself, is
one of the most valuable uses to which the method can be put. Thus when a definite
tonic effect, and that only, is evoked by the excitation, the application of the stimulus
to any fibres of the corona radiata, except those immediately underlying the focus of
representation of the movement of the lower limb, produces no electrical changes in
the lower dorsal cord, even though the muscles of other parts are sent into tonic
contraction.
