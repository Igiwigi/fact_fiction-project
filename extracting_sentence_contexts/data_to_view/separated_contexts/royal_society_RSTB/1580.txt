The relatively few Physo-
stomi that possess au air-bladder but have no pneumotic duct, are in precisely the same
position a8 the majority of the Physoclisti, and whatever capacity for pressure
adjustment they may possess must be due solely to gaseous secretion and absorption,
Of the remainder it will be convenient to consider; in the first place, the Ostario-
physem, and, secondly, those forms in which the air-bladder js said to possess an open
ductus pheumaticus, hut has no Weberian apparatus:

Prom the universal absence of vetia mirabilia in all hitherto investigated Ostatio-

Monpau’s researches clearly demonstrate that those Ostariophysese with whicl:
is experimented, possessed the compensating advantage of being able to substitute
fox absorption the mechanical liberation of gas through the ductus pneumaticus. This couclusion is aléo supported by many observations which ga to prove that while
free in the water and under normal conditions, many Cyprinide eject gas through
tha mouth on rising to the surface. Hence it follows that such Physostomi possess
distinct advantage over all Physoclisti in the fact that they can, during ascent, more

diminishing pressure by liberating the necessary quantity of gas than by relying

that in descent the converse must be true, inasmuch as the absence of retia mirabilia
gin the former group will render the process of adjustment to an angmented pressure a
much slower one than is probably the case in the latter. On the other hand, as
