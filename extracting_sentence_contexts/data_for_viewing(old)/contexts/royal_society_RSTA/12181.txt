-3 Function by Lord Raytetan. He has shown* that in all cases in which the frictional

© velocity, when the motion is restricted to be such as maintains geometrical similarity
in the system—i.e. in all cases in which, (2,y,2,) and (2%,z.) being the two particles,
the components of the frictional stress between them are

Pe (x, a 5), By (nm = Yo)s BP: (2 bes 2),

i where Pas Py, Hs ave any functions of the co-ordinates—the virtual work of the frictional
= forces in any geometrically possible displacement may be derived from the variation

of a single function JF. The virtual work for the two particles just specified is in
fact

Px (0, — wy) 8 (ary — 2) + by (Yr — Yo) 8 (Yh — Ya) + Bs (1 — 4) 8 (HA — 4);

nd for the whole system it will be found by addition of such expressions as this.
ow if we form the variation, with respect to the velocities alone, of the expression

F= 4 R{pe (x, has w,)? + fy (~ % Yo) + ps (4 i 2)"},

is kind occurs however incidentally in the ‘ Mécanique Analytique,’ Section viii., § 2.]
