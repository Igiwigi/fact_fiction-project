768 SIR CHARLES LYELL ON THE STRUCTURE OF LAVAS

up from beneath the gravel and formed the steep sides of the ravine. In the course of
time the waters again excavated a new channel, deeper than the first one, but not always
coinciding with it in all its windings, although mainly in the same direction. 'This new
erosion passed through both the basalt and subjacent tuff, with or without the inter-
vention of the ancient river-bed, according as the new water-course corresponded with or
deviated from the older one. Lastly, the lava of the year 1284, called the © Sciara di
ſemina morta,” flowed, as will be seen by the Map, Plate XLIX, from the Val del Boye
west of Milo, and then north of Ballo to La Macchia, entering the modern channel of
the torrent below that town, and is now in its turn cut through by the torrent, as I saw
when 1 revisited the section in 1858. From this last fact I infer, that as this medizeyal
lava came down to this point from the Val del Bove, s0 many of the antecedent floods
of melted matter, and among them the basaltic current above alluded to, was derived
from that region. 'They would naturally all follow the lowest levels of the then existing
surface of the country, just as the waters draining the eastern slopes of Etna have done.
For this reason the older lava filled the old river-bed, and afterwards the newer lava of
1284 reached the existing river-channel.

We might have expected that what was once an ancient alluvial plain near the sea
should now form a terrace at Giarre 40 or 50 feet above the level of the existing drain-
age, because the whole region must have participated in that upward movement, of
which we find 80 many proofs along the sea-coast. During the gradual rise of the land
the waters would hollow out their new bed, through gravel and incumbent lava, more
