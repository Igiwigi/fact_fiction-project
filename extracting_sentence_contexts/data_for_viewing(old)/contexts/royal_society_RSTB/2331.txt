follows from this that if we regard the whole of the carbon dioxide as entering the
leaf through these openings, diffusion must take place through them at the rate
of 1x ‘OT = 7-77 cub, centims. per square centim. per hour. Now it will be seen
later on that the surface of a strong solution of caustic soda, when freely exposed to
moderately still air containing the normal amount of carbon dioxide (three parts per
10,000 by volume), absorbs that gas at ordinary temperatures at the rate of only
about 120 cub. centim. per square centim. per hour, and when the rate of the air
current passing over the surface is increased the maximum absorption is found to be
‘177 cub. centim. per square centim. per hour. It follows, therefore, that the
absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the whole of the under surface of an
assimilating leaf like that of the Catalpa, must proceed at about one-half the rate
which the same absorptive surface of leaf would possess if it were covered with a
constantly renewed film of a solution of caustic alkali: we may say, in fact, that the
coefticient of absorption of the leaf surface under these conditions is about half that
of the surface of the alkaline solution. If, however, we assume that the absorption
of carbon dioxide in the leaf takes place only through the stomatal openings—which
occupy at the outside not more than ‘9 per cent. of this leaf area—we arrive at the

* The average measurements of a large number of stomatal slits, which are elliptical in shape, gave a
length (L) of 01861 millim. and a breadth (B) of 00423. The area of the slit is given with sufficient
approximation by the expression LB ° which in this case is (0000618 sq. millim. This is equal in area to

a circle of ‘0088 millim. diameter.
