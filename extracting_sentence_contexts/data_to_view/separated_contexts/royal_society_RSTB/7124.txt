250. The goodness of fit was tested by analysis of variance shown in table 17. In fact,
linear equations were fitted separately for the material collected in 1939, 1940 and 1941,
and obtained respectively the values 0-0661, 0-0672 and 0-1009 for the linear coefficient. The improvement due to such separate fitting was tested, but as can be seen from table 17
was not significant. The use of a common value, namely, 0-0793, is thus fully justified.
