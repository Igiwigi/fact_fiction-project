To compare different reconstruction methods to classical widefield fluorescence data :8
(figure 4e), we use three different reconstruction algorithms: : S

1. Super confocal imaging [28]: Here, the stack is processed by applying maxz(Istack(Z)) +
minz(Istack(Z)) â€” 2*meanz(Istack(Z)). It exploits the fact that a sample position in ISM is
most of the time not illuminated when in focus in this sparse illumination scheme. This
successfully reduces background contributions and offers a fast and simple way to obtain
good sectioning (figure 4f).

2. Classical ISM photon reassignment: We base our algorithm on work by McGregor eft al.
[20].
