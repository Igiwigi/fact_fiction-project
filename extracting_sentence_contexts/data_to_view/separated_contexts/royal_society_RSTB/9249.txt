As
such, unrepaired mutagenic errors could be propagated to daughter cells and con-
tribute to the development of cancer. It stands to reason, then, that the more cell
divisions an animal has during its lifetime, the more likely it is for mutagenic
events to occur in somatic cells. In fact, microsatellite alterations and genomic
deep-sequencing analysis of somatic cells have been used to trace cell fates in
mice, providing direct experimental evidence for the accumulation of mutations
with cell division [2-5]. Hence, from this viewpoint, the larger an animal is, the
more likely it should be to develop cancer during its lifetime. This supposition is,
however, not support by empirical observations, which suggest that smaller ani-
mals have a relatively higher rate of cancer compared with larger animals,
or conversely larger animals have a lower than relative expected rate of cancer
development.
