to differentiate the cellular mass of the knot from the cellular tissue of the anterior
end of the primitive streak. Nevertheless, the posterior contour of the knot visible
in the schematic text-fig. 11, is not merely conjectural, though it is less distinct than
in Specimen P. The distinction, in fact, persists until a still later stage of
development. Text-fig. 12 represents a mesial-plane-reconstruction similar to
