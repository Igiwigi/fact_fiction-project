Corollary,—lTt is evident that the regenerator acts most effectually, when the
outlines of the indicator-diagram from A to D, and from B to C, are portions of a
pair of curves of equal transmission (determined as in Proposition IV.) ; for then, if
the operation of the regenerator is perfect, the changes from B to C and from D to A
will be effected without expenditure of heat ; the heat transmitted from the working
snbstance to a given stratum of the regenerator, during any part such as bc, of the
operation BC, being exactly sufficient for the corresponding part, da, of the operation

3 d.F
DA. In this case 70 for each value of Q between Q, and Q,, has the same value at

either side of the diagram. In fact, the effect of a perfect regenerator is, to confer upon any pair of curves of
equal transmission the properties of a pair of curves of no transmMiss0n. (29.) ProposITION NI, —Tnroke.
