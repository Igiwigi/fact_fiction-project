_ show any marked diurnal variation. Thus the observed variation of the errors appears not
i to be a result of those magnetic disturbances which are measured by the fluxgates.
_ The tworesults reported above, (a) the equality of the mean errors of the readings with and
_ without the use of the fluxgate to compensate the field changes, and (b) the lack of correla-
__tion of the errors with the disturbances of the fluxgate trace which records changes in the
gS earth’s field, were somewhat unexpected.
+ A partial explanation seems to be that indicated in §3-7. On normally quiet days the
2 second time differential d2H/dé? of the uniform component of the earth’s horizontal field is
sufficiently small for no appreciable errors to be introduced, provided the astaticism of the
A magnetometer is more than 2000 or so. Thus no reduction in errors is achieved by field
compensation on a quiet day.

The fact that the observed errors are generally considerably larger than the calculated
='Brownian error, and that the errors are very variable, must therefore be sought in other
} eb causes than changes in the earth’s horizontal field. These observed errors may be due to

= (a) changes in the second time derivative d*H/dé dz of the vertical gradient of the earth’s
S horizontal field, (6) gross thermal disturbances affecting the magnetometer, (c) mechanical
© disturbances. The present data are insufficient to indicate the relative importance of these
5 three factors.
In figure 16 is shown the drift of the Caslox magnetometer spot on four separate occasions.
> The position of the spot was read in divisions of the microscope scale (12:5 div. to 1 mm)
= every 30s. The particular records reproduced were chosen to show the nature of the drift
under different conditions, ranging from very quiet to rather disturbed. Against each record
is given the corresponding value of the arithmetic mean error A. For the quietest period
