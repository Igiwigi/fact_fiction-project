to build in ſuch ſmall ſpots of land, where there are
ſtill fewer houſes ? The next fact I have happened to-meet with of
a bird's being ſeen at a conhiderable diſtance from
the ſhore, is in Mr. Forſter's lately publiſhed
tranſlation of Kalm's account of N. America®,

We are there informed that a bird (which Kalm
calls a ſwallow) was ſeen near the ſhip on the 2d
of September, and, 2s he ſuppoſes, 20 degrees from
the continent of America,

© It appears however, by what he before ſtates in his
journal, that the ſhip was not above 5 degrees from
the iſland of Sable. 6

Beſides, if it is contended that this was an Euro-
pean ſwallow on its pafſage acroſs the Atlantic on
the 2d of September, it is too early even for a ſwift,
to have been on its migration, which diſappears
with us ſooner than the three other ſpecies of {Luro-
pean ſwallows þ.
