evaporation of water.

From the want of a strict uniformity in classifying the several parts of the Offal in
the different animals, for the determination of the Fat they contained, a detailed com-
parison of its amount in the corresponding parts in the different animals is not 80 prac
ticable as might be wished. But, since only a small proportion of the fat from the Offal
parts is consumed as human food, such a comparison is of the less importance in a prac

* The fat obtained by melting and expres8ion contained but very immaterial amounts of foreign gubstance;
whilst, independently of other considerations, the composition of the final residue afforded confirmation of
the fact, that the ether determinations very closely indicated the complementary amounts of the originally
existing fat.

point of view. Still, there are here some points worthy of notice, as indicating the
ulation of Fat internally as the animal matures.
1 Ss percentage in the total Offal parts of fat obtained by melting and expression from
[1 the caul or omentum, was, in the half-fat Ox, 4-63, and in the moderately fat Ox, 7:93.
[a the Offal of the store Sheep the percentage of melted and expressed fat from the same
— ouree was 59:14, and in that of the very fat Sheep it was 19:5. Another item of fat,
which is a considerable index to the fattening character and maturity of an animal—but
