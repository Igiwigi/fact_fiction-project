Neither of these falls within experimental error at its predicted position, and one is

more satisfactorily classified otherwise (see notes (s), (w) to Table II). The terms
have therefore not been included in Table V.

Considerable doubt is thrown on the classifications due to L. and E. Buocn of the
4p *D* — 4d2F*, 4p 2F* — 4d2K* multiplets of S Il by the fact that in both the
strongest lines are missing, though, judging by the ones found, they should be amongst
the most intense lines not merely in their own neighbourhood, but also in the whole
spectrum. ‘The evidence adduced is unconvincing: the line 4 4180-12 attributed to
4p °F." — 4d?F,,.* is not to be found on any plates taken during the present investi-
gation—in this, and in being listed by Gites and L. and E. Buocu at totally different
intensities, it exhibits all the characteristics of an impurity line. ‘The line corresponding
to 4p *F,,.* — 4d ?F,,,.* is not listed by L. and E. Buocu, but this transition is assigned
by GittEs to 4 4164-98, an S III line 2-3 cm.-! from the calculated position. It
therefore seems likely that the level common to both multiplets, viz., 4d?F*, has been
wrongly valued. By assigning the value 24643-87 to the term 4d?F;.*, thus making
the multiple level inverted with a separation of — 51-15 em., the two multiplets are
completed in better agreement with the intensity rules,* and three strong lines are
