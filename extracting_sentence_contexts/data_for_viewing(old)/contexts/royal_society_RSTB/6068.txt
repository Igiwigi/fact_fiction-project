J. P. HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES. 59

fused with the chorion; (2) that in so doing they produce at the margin of the primary
sac a number of fixed points between which the accessory lobes grow out as non-
vascular and purely secondary structures, whose sole use apparently is to increase
the cubic capacity of the allantoic sac (H1tn and Burne, ’22); (3) that in the Lemur,
as exemplified by Loris, the vascularization of the chorion does not depend on the
slow spreading of the allantois over its inner surface as is the case for example in the
Carnivores and Ungulates amongst the lower Monodelphia, but is effected precociously
by the direct ingrowth of the umbilical vessels as soon as the necessary pathway has
been provided by the union with it of the primary allantoic sac.

Having established these facts for Loris, we took the earliest opportunity of examining
the Lemuroid material in the Husrecut collection and there we found the serial sections
of the very fine embryo of Nycticebus 302, study of which has served to show that in
this genus also, the chorion is directly vascularized by the primary allantoic sac. This
embryo 302 (No. 6 of Husrecut’s Normentafeln (’07), fig. 5, Pl. IV) is distinctly earlier
than our embryo of Loris 8 and has been sectioned along with the related foetal mem-
branes. It measures in G.L. 4:8 mm. and is stated to possess 39 pairs of somites
(v., p. 40). The amnion is closed and the proamnion is still extensive. According
to Huprecut’s description, the allantois has lost its earlier thick-walled character
and has become transformed into a membranous sac (with a maximum diameter of
7 mm.) whose outer wall spreads out against [is actually fused with] the diplotropho-
blast [chorion].
