The results of the tests are recorded in Table VII. In considering these the approxi-
mate character of the test must be recognised, as also the indefinite condition as regards
heat treatment of most of the specimens. The fact, however, that none of the
specimens in this research contains any large proportion of an alloying element is
reflected in the generally high figures obtained for the specific magnetism, platinum
apparently having no pronounced effect in lowering the figure. * Â© Proc. Roy.
