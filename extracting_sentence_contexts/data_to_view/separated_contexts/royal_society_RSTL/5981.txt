BALL strictly examined,
it would, in all probability, be found that
I the ice near the surface is no more com-
pressed than a log of timber would be if
placed upon the glacier, and permitted to
$hare its motion downwards. T may sum up by saying that a close
examination of the glacier satisfied me,
not only that it presented no phenomena
which were at variance with the pressure
theory, but also exhibited some which, as
far as I could see, were perfectly fatal to
the theory of stratification. The state of
the ice at the base of the Aggischhorn, as shown in fig. 6, is certainly quite in harmony
with the pressure theory ; another fact observed upon the glacier shall be referred to
at a future page. Fig. 6.

of glaciers in the neighbourhood of Monte Rosa. 'The general mechanical conditions of
these glaciers will be evident to an observer stationed upon the Gorner Grat, a point,
view well known to travellers, and famons for the magnificence of the panorama whi
it commands,

As the observer stands here,
down from the heights of the old Weissth-

facing Monte Rosa, the great Gorner glacier, co! q
or at his left, flows beneath him.
