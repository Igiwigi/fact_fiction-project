This is strikingly shown in the Tropics by palms, by such trees as Albizzia, etc., and
by bamboos. The stem of the giant bamboo may attain a height of 60 metres, while
not more than 40 centims. diameter near its base, which dimensions are not far short
of the theoretical limits. All these facts afford strong indirect evidence towards the
necessity of the presence of active living elements in the conducting wood of tall
trees, but, of course, leaves it an open question as to whether these living elements
exercise a direct pumping action. Section 20.—Critical Velocity for Stream-line Flow in Wood Vessels. PorsEvILLe’s formula for the flow of liquid through tubes only applies when the
motion takes place in straight lines.
