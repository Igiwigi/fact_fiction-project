displacement in the main mass, which can be seen to have taken place after the
concretions had been formed (see fig. 9, Plate 18) ; these were probably due to later
earth movements, or the mere weight of the superincumbent strata. In the case of
amass so large as this, the force would come to bear on it directly, and would not
slip off through the softer coal layers, as in the case of the small nodules scattered
thinly through the coal.

One of the arguments used by those who hold the view that the nodules in the
coal are derived from some source other than that providing the coal itself, is that
these nodules or “coal balls” are rounded and very commonly spherical in shape, and
that they must have received their rounded form, as pebbles do, as a result of rolling
over one another in a current of water. Against this argument may be urged the
fact that concretions are typically spherical or approximately spherical in form, We
have in the large mass (see figs. 4 and 9) very clear evidence that the carbonates
accumulated as concretions, evidence which is widely supported by the structure of
the smaller examples (see fig. 13, Plate 19), so that there appears to be no necessity to
invoke the pebble-forming action of moving water to account for the rounding of the
“coal balls.”

When we consider the possibility of streams having ever transported the
calcareous coal balls, we find in the 2-ton mass a strong argument against the
likelihood of such an occurrence. A solid mass of stone weighing over 2 tons, if it
is to be moved by water, necessitates a very much greater transporting power than
was probably present in the streams connected with the deposits which gave rise to
