to 17,262 at 100* C., is only 0'9 per cent. of the total magnetism.
$117, The actual amount of magnetic change, and even its sign, depends on the
* degree of magnetisation. This follows from the known fact that there is a critical
' yalue of the magnetising force, or (more probably) of the magnetisation, below which
heating inereases susceptibility, and above which. heating reduces susceptibility.
(Bavn, Wied. Ann., xi., 1880.) My own experiments have illustrated this in two
ways. In some of them the effects have been studied of repeated heatings (up to
£100? C.) and coolings, on various degrees of induced or residual magnetism in an iron
Swire : in others, curves of the relation of J to H have been drawn when the same
iron wire is magnetised, (1) at ordinary temperature, (2) at 100” C. Both methods of
=experiment have been applied to samples of iron wire both in the soft annealed and
= -drawn states. One or two representative experiments may be quoted.
