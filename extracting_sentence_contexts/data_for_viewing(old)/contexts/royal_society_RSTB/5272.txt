Non-disjunction might also result from the failure of the members of a pair of chromo-
somes to separate at anaphase. In Oe. (biennis x rubricalyx) x ammophila especially
the bivalents may be scattered over the spindle. It is conceivable that the two members
of such a pair might be included within the same daughter nucleus. In this hybrid
also a single pair of chromosomes may be obliquely or even transversely oriented on
the spindle at metaphase (figs. 49, 52). It is possible that such pairs of chromosomes
may not separate in the normal manner at anaphase.

Certain chromosomes have a tendency to lag in anaphase in both the hybrids. This
tendency is much greater in Oe. (bjennis « rubricalyx) x ammophila than it is in the
reciprocal hybrid. In the latter, fairly regular anaphase figures (fig. 30) are often seen,
whilst in the former the chromosomes are always very scattered, as in fig. 33. Such
lagging of chromosomes in anaphase is undoubtedly a hybrid phenomenon. ‘The fact
that it is less marked in one of these hybrids than in the reciprocal is probably due
to the chromosome linkage, which occurs in the one and which is absent from the other.
The linked chromosomes must pass to the equator of the spindle simultaneously, the

connections between them probably break away at approximately the same time
and the chromosomes of each group derived from the ring would pass together to the
pole. As will be seen later, linkage of chromosomes appears to result in much more
regular cytological behaviour than does complete pairing.

Lagging of chromosomes in the heterotypic anaphase results quite frequently in one
or more chromosomes being left out of the daughter nuclei. Chromosomes are also
found occasionally to lag behind and fragment on the spindle during the heterotypic
