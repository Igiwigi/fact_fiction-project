from 100* to go*. The difference by the short instrument is
1,83 division.

Although the results Å¿ound from the preceding experiments
come nearer those of the experiments by weight than might
have been expected, considering the many objections that
instruments of this kind must naturally present, and the great
differences which were actually found among themselves on
repeating the experiments, especially in the expansion of pure
spirit, where the difference has been equivalent to 1,68 grains
in weight, upon the quantity used in our experiments with
the weighing-bottle ; yet I think, after a careful perusal of
the foregoing facts, I shall not be thought too precipitate
when I say, that these instruments neither do nor can possess
that accuracy which we have been led to expect from them.
We have seen, in the foregoing experiments, that there has
sometimes been apparently a loss of some part of the fluid,
after an alteration of the temperature ; at other times there
appeared to be no loss at all ; and sometimes there appeared
to be even more $pirit in the instrument than there was at
