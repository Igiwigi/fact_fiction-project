magnitudes from WR stars.

Looking in more detail at the RSG progenitors of SN IIP in figure 4, we notice that their
absolute magnitude linearly correlates in the initial mass of the progenitor. This was noticed in
earlier studies [1,2,19], and is essentially caused by the combination of higher He core masses and
higher effective temperatures as the progenitor initial mass increases from 8 to 20 Mg. While RSGs
are prone to the complicated effects of circumstellar extinction [19], the current models seem to
reproduce well the range of observed absolute magnitudes of RSGs before explosion as well as
the maximum absolute magnitude of an SN IIP [8].

Another striking result from combined stellar evolution models is the fact that LBVs could be
immediate SN progenitors. While observational studies in the last decade have suggested LBVs
as SN progenitors (e.g. [4,20-23]), classical stellar evolution models had predicted that the most
massive stars would explode as WR stars instead [15,24]. Although SNe with LBV progenitors
should be rare, they provide invaluable constraints on stellar evolution and the effects of mass
loss on SN progenitors.

Identifying LBVs as immediate SN progenitors in stellar evolution models is only possible
when the effects of an extended atmosphere and wind are taken into account. These models [9]
suggest that stars with initial masses in the range 20-25 Mo are likely LBVs at the pre-SN stage
based on the three following properties.

First, the pre-SN synthetic spectra computed with combined stellar evolution models are
