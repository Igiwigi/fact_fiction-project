the F, adopted should be that given by (— 28,) Fs = (4) 34527°64 or F; = 34516°37 with vy = 830-83.

m= 10. The allocation seems satisfactory. The limits also are very close to the correct, but the
different triplet separations show that the successive sequents suffer displacement, but the same in each
F, F.

m= 11, The calculated F, is 29966°21. With (1) 29982-13 = (—8,)F,, F, = 29967:22. Moreover
the last has links ¢ = 7314°34 to (3) 22652°88 and wu = 4133-20 to (In) 25854°02 in very striking
agreement. The value as calculated with normal e is entered. With the lines as entered it is seen that
the means of the corresponding separations for the two series are both normal, although the individuals
are abnormal. This shows that both corresponding lines have the same limit, and the same sequent, but
that the latter shows a displacement from the normal value for the F, set. This is supported also by the
fact that there are a number of close lines to F,. For instance, (2) 33332-22 and (2) 33330-00 as (38,) F,
give respectively 33348°51 and 6°29 for F,. They are probably all F, lines showing sequence displace-
ments. The first gives the triplet separations 1865-14, 828-42 and limit 32589-77, the second 1862-92,
830-64 and limit 32588°66. In other words, the first gives F,, with same sequent as in F, and F,, the
second as in Fy,

m= 12. Note the good agreement—the same (— 26) displaced limit for F,. F, and same 26, for F,
and Fs.

m=13. The two displaced sets give F, = 30167°38, F, = 31283°59. The calculated
F, = 30166-40.

m = 14 fo 30. It is remarkable how the series seems to persist to high order. It may be said that
