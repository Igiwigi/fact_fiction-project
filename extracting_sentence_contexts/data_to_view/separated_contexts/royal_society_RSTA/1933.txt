Hence, it can be shown that the minimization of H under constraints Gp = Gpu, =


Gye = 0 is equivalent to the minimization of the Lagrange function, i.e. Vi(H + ApGp + Apug Gpuy + ApEGpE) =0

Val" =0, A6
Gp =Gpu, = Gpz =0 Mik ° (A6)

since

a,L4=G,=0, ,,,L4%=Gou, =0, a

roe Gor =0. Interestingly, the condition Vv, LH =0 leads to the following exponential form of the
equilibrium state:

fr) =aexp[-( + dp + Apu Cia + ApECr I, (A7)

due to the fact that V,H =Infj +1. Applying the same steps with the general set of constraints (2.12), one obtains the following
(generalized) Lagrange function:

Lip =H + > Ave Gpgr- (A8)

The condition Vy Lie =0 eventually leads to

f; 1 =aexp - (: “Zagat | (A9)
Par

It is worth noting that the above form of the numerical equilibrium is not unique and,
obviously, depends on the scaling factor a. To the best of our knowledge, the latter cannot
depend on the velocity discretization but it can be space- and/or time-dependent [55].
