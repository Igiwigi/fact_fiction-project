closely analogous to the readily apparent obstacles to learn- Percentage problems are generally presented as adding or sub-
ing the bidirectional mapping between fractions and tracting some percentage. When the changes are sequential, the
decimals. It is far from obvious that 517/103 = 5.01941748. presentation in terms of adding and subtracting makes it easy

to overlook the crucial fact that what is added or subtracted is
obtained by multiplication. When the cost of a litre increases
by 50%, the new price is 1+0.5=3/2 times the old price. When that price then drops by 50%, the new price is (0.5 x
1.5 = 0.75) of the original price.
