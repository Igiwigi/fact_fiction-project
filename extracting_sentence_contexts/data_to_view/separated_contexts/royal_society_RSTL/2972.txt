I shall
leave it to the. Society to. determine, whether I have been
successful-in my attempt. The firs fact to. be noticed, in regard to the preparation of
the mummy,-is the chestnut brown tint of all. the bandages,
denoting the- presence of some colouring matter-//in them,
the nature of which it was important to ascertain, in order to
judge of the intention of those who employed it. | For this
purpose I made a few experiments with portions of the ban-
dages taken from different parts of the body, when it was
found that they had all been steeped in some vegetable solu-
tion, which, when treated with gelatine, exhibited the pre-
sence of tannin in-considerable quantity, a circumstance far-

ther corroborated by the peculiar taste of the infusion. Now,
as every particle of the bandages had been equally died with
this vegetable solution ; and as it appears evident, from-other
circumstances, that such a process had not been adopted for
the sake of giving to the envelopes of the mummy the par-
ticular colour in question, may we not infer that the Egyp-
tian embalmers were acquainted with the antiseptic power
of astringent and slightly bitter vegetable infusions, a power
which modern discoveries have attributed to the presence of
the peculiar principle already mentioned ?
