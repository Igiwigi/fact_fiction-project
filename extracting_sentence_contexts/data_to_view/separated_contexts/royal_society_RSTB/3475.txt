The constituent cells of each mass tend towards a disposition about a central cavity,
actual or potential; and each focal cavity obviously represents a segregated portion
of the original cleft-like archenteric cavity. The differentiation of these cell-groups is, however, confined to a very limited
region immediately behind the plane at which the ventral archenteric wall undergoes
disintegration. But for the fact that they attain to great definiteness and extension
in the slightly more advanced Specimen E, they might have been passed over
without special remark in the present case. Figs. 52-54 represent photomicrographs
of three consecutive sections across the archenteron in Specimen PP, the last of which
shows the disintegration of the archenteric floor. It is easy to see, if a comparison
be made between figs.
