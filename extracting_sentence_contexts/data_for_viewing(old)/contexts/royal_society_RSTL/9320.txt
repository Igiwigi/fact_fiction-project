= Ix the year 1863 the late Dr. W. A. Mz described his method of examining the
& diactinic properties of various saline solutions and organic swbstances. (Mirren, © On
= the Photographic Transparency of Various Bodies, &e.,” Phil. Trans., 1863, 1)
S He found that the spectrum transmitted by lenses and prisms of rock-crystal was
E far superior in length as determined by sensitive photographic plates, to that
& obtained when lenses and prisms of glass and other materials were employed. He
& found particularly that the spectrum produced by passing electric sparks between
= silver points was very rich in photographic rays, and he ascertained how far various
S 8nbstances were transparent to these rays. Professor STOKEs at the same time com-
Z municated results he had obtained when studying the long spectrum of the electric
Z light by receiving the rays on a fluorescent screen. (SToKrs, © On the Long Spectrum
E of Electric Light,” Phil. Trans., 1863, I.) He discovered the fact that certain solutions
Z 8howed light and dark bands which were otherwise invisible. More recently, M. SokeT
A has studied the absorption of the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum transmitted by
various substances, using for the purpose a spectroscope of his invention, which has a
fluorescent, eye-piece. (Sorwr, © Recherches ur VAbsorption des Rayons Ultra-violets
par diverses substances,” * Archives des Sciences Physiques eb Naturelles ; * Geneva,
January, 1878.) In 1872 the apparatus of Dr. MiLER was reconstructed by one of
us, and certain improvements were introduced. The intention of repeating his experi-
ments and carrying them out in a more complete manner was prompted by a desire
to know what relation, if any, exists between the molecular constitution and the
actinic absorption of organic substances. No encouragement to pursue this line of
research was offered by the results of Dr. MiLLes, since he states, © T have not been
