the 4-inch brake shaft by set pins, so that it revolves with the shaft (figs. 2 and 8),
and (2) a brake (or brake case) which encloses the wheel, the shaft passing through
bushed openings in the case which it fits closely, so as to prevent undue leakage of
water while leaving shaft and brake-wheel free to turn in the case, except for the
slight friction of the shaft (figs. 1, 2 and 3).

The outline of the axial section of the brake-wheel is that of a right cylinder, 4 inches
thick. The cylinder is hollow—in fact, made of two dises which fit together, forming

an internal boss for attachment to the shaft, and also meet together at the periphery,
forming a closed annular box, except for apertures to be further described (fig. 3).
In each of the outer dise faces of the wheel are 24 pockets (carefully formed),
43 inches radial and 14 inches deep measured axially, but so inclined that the narrow
partitions or vanes (4 inch) are nearly semicircular dises inclined at 45° to the

axis; the vane on one face being perpendicular to the vane on the opposite face
(fig. 2).
