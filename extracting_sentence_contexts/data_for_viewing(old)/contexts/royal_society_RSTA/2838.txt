positive unit normal to y at y(s). Equation (5.5) can be written in the following form (figure 7):

F(z4. — r(I — R_¢)n) = F(z— + r(I — Re)n); (5.12)

In the sequel, we write equation (5.12) for
fork =f- glk,
in both Cases 1, 2. Where we write
f:=fy, inCasel and f:=f,-f-  inCase2.

Also we use the fact that Vf does not vanish on y+,, y_y except for finitely many points. Moreover,
as the curves y+,, y_r are parallel to y, vector n(s) is orthogonal to y,,, y_; at the points z, = y+;(s),

z_ = y-_,(s). Furthermore, as F vanishes on the boundaries and is non-negative inside the annulus,
then the vector of VF on both boundaries is directed inside the annulus. Therefore, we can write


(figure 7):

n(s) = ae += aa -). (5.13)

Using this, we rewrite (5.12):
