Q Again, it is to be noticed that when the ventricle is made to beat s8ynchronously
a

NY with every second beat of the auricles, either by heating the anricles and sinus as in
5 Plate 67, fig. 1), or by tightening the clamp as in Plate 67, fig. 3, the slower contrac-
X tions are always larger than the previous ones, and this greater force of the contraction
5 is only partly, at all events, due to the fact that with a slower beat the muscle con-
> tracts from a position of greater relaxation than with a quicker one. The figures, it is
S true, show that the lever does fall lower between the contractions when the ventricle
2 is beating slowly than when it is beating quickly—a fact which proves that, with the
Z ordinary rate of beating, the ventricle has not time to relax to its full extent before
"3 another contraction commences—but they also show that the lever rises above the level
of the previous quicker beats ; in other words, the slower beats are accompanied by an
'Z increase in the force of the contraction as well as by an increase in the relaxation of
2 the muscle between the beats.
Z The similarity between the effects of clunping and those of heating the auricles and
V &inus upon the rhythm of the ventricle is 80 marked and consistent, that we may fairly
= conclude that any explanation which is sufficient for the one phenomenon must also
Z resolve the other.
S What factors, then, can be conceived as common to these bwo methods by which
V such similar results may be produced ?
V ln the first place, it may be argued that the excitability of the ventricular musele
