Figure 11. Comparison of the spectra of inboard LE probe w, (grey) and velocity magnitude from inboard TE rake probe (black):
(a) 10 mm from the suction surface, (b) 31 mm from the suction surface and (c) 52 mm from the suction surface. The solid and
the dashed white lines represent the slopes of the high-frequency region, for the LE probe wp and velocity magnitude from the
TE rake probes, respectively.

can be attributed to the fact that the innermost probe, being well inside the boundary layer, is
strongly modulated by the local angle of attack (for which @ is a surrogate), which is in turn
driven by the atmospheric horizontal fluctuations quantified by wp, whereas the outermost probe,
located in the nearly irrotational flow in the outer part or outside the boundary layer, primarily
responds to the temporal fluctuations in the potential flow velocity magnitude Vp. Interestingly,
it can be observed that the time series of the gradient of the velocity magnitude (approximately
equal to the vorticity magnitude) estimated from the two outermost probes (figure 10b) shows
qualitative similarity with the velocity magnitude from the innermost probe and blade inflow
a and wp. Conversely, the gradient estimated from the two innermost probes shows relatively
non-coherent time variation. This is possibly due to the fact that the near-blade vorticity has
a significant contribution from the blade shear-layer-generated small-scale fluctuations, which
do not have the apparent longer-time-scale coherence observed in the velocity magnitude
signal.
