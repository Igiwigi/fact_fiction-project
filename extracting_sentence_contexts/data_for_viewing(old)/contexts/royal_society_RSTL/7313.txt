Fur the only secure basis of Zoological Science is afforded by a thorough elucidation
Sf the structure and life-history of typical forms representing particular subdivisions of
He Animal Kingdom, will not, I anticipate, be disputed by any Naturalist of the present
"Hay. And every one who is even slightly acquainted with the history of that Science
*Must be well aware that the standard Monographs which have been devoted to this
Sject have exerted a more permanent influence on its progress, than have any of those
Somprehensive Systems which have been set up from time to time, and, after lasting for
*8-while, have been overthrown to make way for others scarcely more durable. For any
ystem of Claxsification is liable to be invalidated by new discovery ; and the utmost
-Shich can be claimed for it is, that it accurately represents the state of knowledge at
She time of its promulgation. But every Monograph which contains a faithful descrip-

Sbsolute completeness, presents a body of facts which subsequent research may add to

I cannot, suppose, therefore, that any apology is needed for my offering to the Royal
> Society a detailed account of perhaps the most interesting of our British Echinoderms ;
of which the structure, notwithstanding the attention given to it by various eminent
 Anatomists, has been hitherto but very imperfectly made out ; whilst of its life-history

Â» far more than I can affirm ; but I venture to think that what T now bring forward will

Portance, not merely in leading to a better understanding of the important group of
