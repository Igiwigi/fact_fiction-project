scheme indicates the state corresponding to v = (1,1,0, —1 — 1). We observe that the dynamics is
identical to the dynamics shown in figure 7b which we have obtained for the modular fractal
model. This is due to the fact that in spite of very different topologies, the eigenvectors of the
networks and thus the dynamics are identical. We also study the solutions that do not correspond to eigensolutions. We do so for the three
different motifs as shown in figure 10a-c, respectively, and for a hierarchy of n =2.
