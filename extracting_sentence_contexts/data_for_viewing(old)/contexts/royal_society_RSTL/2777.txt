moon's greatest, declination; and the period of its vanishing corresponds in like
manner with the time of the moon passing the equator. Between periods corre-

302 THE REV. W. WHEWELL ON TIDE OBSERVATIONS

sponding to two such passages, the inequality increases from 0 to a maximum, and
decreases to 0 again ; after which it again increases.

The curves which represent the heights do, in fact, exhibit snch alternate increase
and diminution of the diurnal inequality : and the inquiry naturally occurs, After how
long a time does the moon's position show its effect in the diurnal inequality? In
the case of Liverpool it appears, as I have pointed out *, that the diurnal inequality
expresses the effect of the forces (upon the equilibrium-spheroid) as they existed six
days previously. It is important to know whether this interval is the same in other
places.

25. Itis very far from being the same, and its changes are very curious, In June 1835
the moon had her greatest south declination on the 12th ; her declination vanished
on the 19th, early in the morning; and her greatest north declination was on the
26th. On the American coast, the diurnal inequality, as shown by the zigzag form
of the curves, followed these changes, not at an interval of days, but almost simulta-
