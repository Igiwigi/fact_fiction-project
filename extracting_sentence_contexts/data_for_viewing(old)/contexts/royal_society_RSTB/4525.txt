would seem to us that a still fairer approximation would be obtained by taking the
whole period following the stop of the muscular work in which the respiratory quotient
is above the value found in the last work period, and reckoning as surplus CO,
expelled from the body the volume of CO, in excess of what is required by the

oxygen intake if one allows a respiratory quotient identical with that shown in the

last work period. The real metabolic respiratory quotient directly after the work can
hardly exceed that shown during the last stages of the work; in fact, the general
course of events would suggest that it begins to fall very soon after the exercise stops.
We can obtain a limiting value for this surplus CO, discharge by assuming that the
real metabolic respiratory quotient falls immediately after the stop of the work to its
final steady value, and calculating the excess CO, on this assumption for the whole
period which elapses before the respiratory exchange and observed respiratory quotient.
become steady, for such a value must be in excess of the true one since the respiratory
exchange and metabolic respiratory quotient are bound to approximate in the first
few moments after the stop to the values shown during the last stages of the work,
while no account is taken of the possibility that the fall of the respiratory quotient
may be in part attributable to retention of CO, The values calculated by these
three methods are given in Table XII, and it will be seen that with the exception of
Experiment 11 the apparent surplus of CO, expelled is greater after the heavier work
