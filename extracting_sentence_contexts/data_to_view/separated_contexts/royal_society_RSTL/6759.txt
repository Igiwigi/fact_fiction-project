- equation by means of a definite single integral has been obtained by the same analyst. While the subject seems to be more important with relation to differential than with
reference to algebraic equations, the connexion into which the two subjects are brought
must itself be considered as a yery interesting fact, As respects the former of these
8ubjects, it may be observed that it is a matter of quite fundamental importance to
ascertain for what forms of the function pþ (D), equations of the type

known integrable form an infinite number of others, Yet there is every reason to think

that the number of really primary forms—of forms the knowledge of which, in combi-
nation with such known theorems, would enable us to solve all equations of the aboye
type that are finitely solvable—is extremely small. It will, indeed, be a most remark-
able conclusion, should it ultimately prove that the forms in question stand in absolute
and exclusive connexion with the class of algebraic equations here considered.
