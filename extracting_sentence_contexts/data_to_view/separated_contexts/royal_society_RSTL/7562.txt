2 Returning to the proper representation of the series by means of an equation con-
5 taining the coordinates of the parametric point, say an equation (#L#, y, 1)" =0, in- A volving the two coordinates (w, y), it is to be noticed that forming the derived equation
and eliminating the coordinates of the parametric point, we obtain an equation rational
in the coordinates (@, y), and also rational of the degree N in the differential coefficient

= in fact since the number of curves through any given point (a, Yo) is =N, the

differential equation must give this number of directions of passage from the point

d;
(2%, 4%) to a consecutive point, that is, it must give this number of values of =, and must

consequently be of the order N in this quantity. T2

Conversely, if a given differential equation rational in , y, -2 and of the degree N in

the last-mentioned quantity 2; admit of an algebraical general integral, the curves re-

presented by this integral equation may be taken to be irreducible curves, and this being
s0 they will be curves of a certain order 7 forming a series of the index N; whence the
general integral (assumed to be algebraical) is given by an equation of the aboye-men-
tioned form, viz. an equation rational of a certain order 7 in the coordinates, and con-
taining linearly and homogeneously the Â«+1 coordinates of a variable parametric point.
