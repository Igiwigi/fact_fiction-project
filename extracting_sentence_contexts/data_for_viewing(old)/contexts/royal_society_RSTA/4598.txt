In this section, we discuss the pervasive uncertainties associated with climate change. This is done
with a view to understanding where continued scientific research may be able to provide better
signals about the future of climate change. Taken together, Millner et al. [16,17] provide a helpful
structure, which we now summarize.

Predicting the future is a difficult task at the best of times, but the sheer complexity and time
horizon associated with climate change amplifies these difficulties. Our knowledge about the
future of climate change comes from two main sources: (i) scientific understanding, including
physical laws and (ii) the empirical predictions of climate models. While the laws are matters of


fact, the movement from laws to predictions leads to an uncertain picture of the future as the models
attempt to reproduce extremely complex systems using different assumptions and calibrations.
There is a distinction to be drawn between predictions or forecasts and projections in this context.
The former ‘attempts to account for the correct phase of natural internal climate variations (such
as the El Nifto Southern Oscillation), whereas the latter does not’. A forecast must be initialized
to be in phase with the observed cycles and becomes a projection as it moves out of phase.
A projection is still a valid representation of the statistical properties of the climate system, yet
without an explicit conditioning on the phase of the natural variability. Alternatively, the IPCC
refers to the most likely projection as a forecast [2]. Whether predicting or projecting the future
climate, models are subject to their own errors and potential omissions [25].

In the context of adaptation, the uncertain process of technological change means that the
future costs of adaptation are also a source of uncertainty about the future, just as abatement costs :
