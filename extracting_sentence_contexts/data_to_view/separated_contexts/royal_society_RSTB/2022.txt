102 DR. D, H. SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES

speaking of recent plants, but rather as a type of petiolar structure, common, no
doubt, to a certain group of the Medullosez. M. Renavutr found reason to believe that Myelowylon Landrioti: represents the
petiole and rachis of leaves belonging to the form-genus Alethopteris. The organiza-
tion of the leaves of our Medullosa renders it highly probable that they too would
fall under the same category, The resemblance in structure to M. RENAULtâ€™s specimens
is, in fact, a very close one.* The identification of the leaf of Medullosa anglica cannot,
however, be finally settled without further investigation, on which I am now engaged. 8.
