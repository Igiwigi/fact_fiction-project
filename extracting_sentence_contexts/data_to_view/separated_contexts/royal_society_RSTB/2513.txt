Two possibilities suggest themselves in this connection. It may, of course, occur
that a section, especially if transverse, may be so cut that the hypha, which has pierced
the cell-wall and is attached by a thin long neck to the body of the haustorium, lies
below or above the plane of section, and in that case the body of the haustorium
would appear isolated in the cell as a so-called “cotpuscule.” Such has in fact
occurred in the preparations shown in my figs. 11, 16a, 27, 28, and 44, but I have
so rarely failed to observe the hyphae, or at least traces of them, in the immediate
neighbourhood, that I hesitate to put such a suggestion forward in explanation of
Erixsson’s figures, The second, and more probable, possible explanation is that Errksson’s method of
preparation of his sections is responsible for his failure to trace his isolated “ corpus-
cules ” to their parent hyphe.
