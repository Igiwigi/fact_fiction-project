a also repeatedly found that the apparatus was s0 sensible that if the aperture of the
HS, tube was placed opposite the nostril at an inch distance. the opposite aperture being
ved, movements of the lever were produced by the air passing in and out in ordinary
teathing. By these facts, as well as by the comparison of the width of the T tube with
tHat of the natural air-passages, I was convinced that, so far from the resistance afforded
ing greater, it was considerably less than in ordinary breathing through the nostrils. rther, from what I believed I had ascertained as to the mode in which the results are

IBoduced, I was led to expect that they would not have been in the slightest degree mo-

Furpose of testing the truth of this assumption I made the following experiment.
