The 1140 cm~! series, on the other
hand, shows none of the characteristics predicted for the skeletal series and for this
reason is considered to arise principally from the in-plane methyl rocking modes R,. The
1120 cm™ series has a symmetry class combination appropriate to the y skeletal or the R,
methyl rocking modes. If this series were interpreted as the yf skeletal series then it should
move towards the o series near 890 cm~! with increasing n; in fact, it is observed to move
away from this value and converges towards the 1140 cm~! series as the chain lengthens. Further, if it is the skeletal series it should converge to the « skeletal frequency in pro-
pane, i.e. 1053 cm~!. However, it moves away from this value as the chain length de-
creases and can be traced back smoothly to an origin at 923 cm~! in propane.
