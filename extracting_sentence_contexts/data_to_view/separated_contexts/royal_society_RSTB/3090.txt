His eyes were easily tired with the light, so that I was not able to continue the
examination long enough to get at the complete explanation of his nomenclature of
certain colours. His blue-green junction was quite normal as to the effect on it of physiological
fatigue, and as to position, it indicated a strong green sensation. His spectrum was
shortened at the red end, but not so much as in the case of the totally red-blindâ€”
it reached, in fact, farther than I could trace my own green sensation during artificial
red-blindness. For this reason I think he must possess some traces of a red sensation, and also
because of the curious uncertainty he manifested concerning this part of the spectrum. DR. G. J. BURCH ON CASES OF COLOUR-BLINDNESS.
