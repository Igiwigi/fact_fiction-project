been systematically ignored in previous work. These neurons
could act as ‘saliency detector’ neurons and may have the
function to ensure that the early post-stimulus part of
neural responses (which is the most informative one in many
cases [1,6,10,29]) is not missed out. Future work is required
to elucidate the exact morphological and biophysical proper-
ties and the location within cortical microcircuits of such
putative salience detection neurons. Future work also needs
to elucidate how these neurons interact with slow network
rhythms to collectively form reliable and precise intrinsic
temporal reference frames for neural coding.

It is important to bear in mind that the fact that the timing
of spikes relative to stimulus timing carries information
and that the brain has an effective intrinsic clock to read out
this information do not necessarily imply that the brain actu-
ally extracts information this way. These two conditions are
necessary, rather than sufficient, for spike timing of neurons
post-stimulus to be used in brain function. The brain may

It is important to consider whether the intrinsic reference
frames proposed above generalize across sensory modalities.
The existence of internal reference frames has previously been
investigated in visual cortex. Shriki et al. [63] studied the encod-
ing of visual orientation and also reported a subpopulation
