Symbol of a Couple.—Let the couple consist of two forces, U Fig. 33. at the point , and —U at the point #': then these two forces are com- AD
pletely represented, as regards their effect on the rigid body, by the $ +a Ihe

expression W 0
(U+u.U)+(—U+u.(—U))
or (u—u').U,
which is the general symbol for a couple; as indeed is clear beforehand from the
fact, that the couple is that which translates the force U from the point (#') to the
point (), 4. e. along the line (u—u'). It will be generally simpler to employ the symbol in the form
u.U,
u here denoting, symbolically, the line drawn from the point of application of the
force (—U) to that of the force (U).
