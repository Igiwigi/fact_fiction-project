very accurate agreement. When the axis was thus verified, measurements of the
breadth between the two extreme dots visible laterally were taken at various levels
on the height of the curve. It is not thought necessary to give these measurements
in detail, and perhaps one example will suffice. The measured distance between the
extreme dots at the lower end of the photograph, where it is broadest, is 59°0 mm.
as stated already, and the violet and red portions have breadths 30°5 and 28°5,
measuring on either side of the axis. This difference is 20 mm. against the theoretical
value 1°97. This agreement, typical of the agreement throughout, is a convincing
proof that the broadened H, is, in its energy distribution, absolutely symmetrical
about its centre, and that the apparent asymmetry—only evident to the eye on the
magnified photographs—is entirely due to the fact that the prismatic spectrum is not
normal,

This is the second fundamental result of the work—that the broadening of H, under
the condensed discharge is an absolutely symmetrical one.

To a high order of approximation, inequality of dispersion lengthens the breadth of
the violet and shortens that of the red to an equal extent, so that their sum is the
breadth of the curve with a dispersion uniformly equal to that at 46563. To draw
a graph of the symmetrical curve for uniform dispersion, therefore, we merely require
to measure the total breadth of the photograph for various heights, and plotting half
total breadth against height, we obtain one side of the curve for uniform dispersion.
Now the total height, from base to apex, of the H, curve in question, is 192 mm., and
