Sdoubt that the heat emerging from such a plate would pass through a second layer of
Fglas 1 millimetre thick, without suffering any measureable absorption. For an incom-

=parably stronger reason, the quantity of solar heat absorbed by a bubble of air at the
Searth's surface, after the rays have traversed the whole thickness of our atmosphere, and

Sheen «ifted in their passage through it, must be wholly inappreciable.

S 29. To the sifting power of the atmosphere we must add, in the case of the glacier,

Ethe absorptive power of the ice. Some notion of this power, as compared with that of air,

A may be gathered from the following facts :;—As regards the variation of the intensity of

radiant heat with the distance, the law of inverse squares is capable of the strictest expe-

rimental yerification in air, even when the source of heat is far below 212* Faur.

This implies that the absorption in the space of air through which the heat passes is

too small to disturb the harmony of the law. Now a plate of ice, one-tenth of an inch

thick, is absolutely impervious to heat emanating from a source, not only of 212®, but
of 752? Fan. ; and is capable, moreover, of absorbing 994 per cent. of the calorific rays
