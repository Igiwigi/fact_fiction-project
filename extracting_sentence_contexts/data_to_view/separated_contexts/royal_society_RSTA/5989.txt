These regularities, which span many orders of
magnitude in scale, imply a common origin of these facts; while this may or may not be attributed
to Weyl gravity, the presence of the characteristic column density given in equation (2.6), obtained
first in the exact solution of this theory, does not appear accidental.

(ii) Gravitational lensing

The exact metric form of equation (2.4) incites the computation of gravitational lensing in
this theory, as a means of testing other aspects of its astrophysical ramifications. Here, the
reader is cautioned that naive application of standard lensing formulae produces nonsensical
results (deviation angle increasing with the light ray impact parameter). The reason for such


behaviour is due to the fact that standard gravitational lensing formalism has been developed
in asymptotically flat spaces. Motivated by the approach of Rindler & Ishak [17], who studied the gravitational lensing
effects of the de Sitter component of the Schwarzschild—-de Sitter metric, Sultana & Kazanas
[18] showed that the nonsensical results obtained by applying superficially the asymptotically
flat space lensing formalism are due to the difference in the definition of the light bending
angles in the non-asymptotically flat space of equation (2.4). The result of this approach to the
asymptotically non-flat space of equation (2.4) for a light ray of impact parameter b with respect
to the coordinate origin is given by
