This is demonstrated by reduced fitness and
increased mortality and faster rates of ageing in both castes
[32]. Additionally, transcriptome analyses reveal a clear
oxidative stress defence signal (including Prx3) under con-
stant conditions, which is stronger in workers than queens. These at first sight unexpected results can be explained by
the fact that workers of this species are totipotent immatures,
which have not yet reached maturity [32]. By stressing honeybee workers by an infection with a
virus and treatment with the oxidative stressor paraquat,
Kennedy ef al. [33] reveal that reproductive workers are
better protected against stress than non-reproducing workers. The transcriptome analyses show that both reproductive acti-
vation and paraquat-induced stress result in an upregulation
of genes from, e.g., JH pathways (including vitellogenin) as
well as antioxidant genes.
