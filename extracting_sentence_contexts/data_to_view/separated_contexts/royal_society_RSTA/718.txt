Guided by physical intuition
and by experimental evidence (figure 1), we expect
the formation of wrinkles or creases to be arranged
orthogonally to the direction of greatest contraction, and
thus aligned with a principal direction of deformation. However, as we show in this paper, the mathematical
equations modelling the development of such surface
instabilities do not necessarily predict that they should
be such principal wrinkles (figure 2a). In fact, we find
that for the simplest boundary value problem there is,
ie. that of a deformed semi-infinite solid, the theory
predicts that oblique wrinkles (figure 2b) should appear
on the free surface prior to the principal wrinkles. THE ROYAL SO C IETY ©2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.
