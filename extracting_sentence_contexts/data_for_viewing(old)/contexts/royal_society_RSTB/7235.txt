fields, but not all fields are sampled, so that the sampling error consists partly of variation
between fields and partly of variation between subsamples within fields’ (pp. 493-494).

, 353. It will be noticed that Cochran is adhering to the scheme of uni-stage sampling
_ inasmuch as the sampling units are selected by one single act of randomization. He then
_ contemplates the estimate for the selected sampling units being obtained by a number of
_ subsamples, and calls this ‘incomplete subdivision’. For present purposes, it is preferable
to call this two-stage sampling. In the present terminology sampling unit has a somewhat
generalized connotation. In multi-stage work there is, in fact, a hierarchy of sampling
units at successive stages. The units selected in the first stage of randomization may be
_ called sampling units of the first stage; within each such selected sampling unit smaller
= sampling units are selected by a second act of randomization, and these are sampling units
& of the second stage (these are called subsamples by Cochran); within each second-stage
8 sampling unit smaller sampling units are drawn at random by a third act of randomization,
& and so on. Present terminology is thus more general and more convenient for dealing
& with this type of sampling.

S 354. Cochran further writes: ‘An important practical consideration in subsampling is
6 the division of resources between the amount of subsampling per sampling unit and the
© number of sampling units chosen. For a given expenditure, one can only be increased at
2) the expense of the other. The best compromise will depend on the relative costs of increasing
