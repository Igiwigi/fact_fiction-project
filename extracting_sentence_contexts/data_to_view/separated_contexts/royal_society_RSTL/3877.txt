The object to be aimed at in perfecting a thermo-electric diagram, is to make the
ordinates of the lines (which will in general be curves) corresponding to the different
metallic specimens be exactly proportional to their thermo-electric differences * from
a standard metal (P, in the actual diagram). FF 102, 103. Theoretical inferences regarding Electrical Convections of Heat, from
Facts of Thermo-electric Inversion. 102. ' The thermo-dynamic reasoning adduced above ({y 10 to 15) leads to the
conelusion ({{ 14, 15), that the convective power of the vitreous electricity is greater,
or (which is the same thing) the convective power of the resinous electricity is less, m
each metal for which the line in the diagram cuts the line for another metal from below
it on the left to above it on the right, than in this other metal.
