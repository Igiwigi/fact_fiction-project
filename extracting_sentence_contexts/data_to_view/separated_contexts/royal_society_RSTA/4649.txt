Define the Banach spaces
Ly = 4 u:[0,T]> (J XQ) x (8, tH GH, 16-(yfi() € LO, T; Xo) f for p € [1 00)
te[0,T]
LY = yue Ly | ess sup||u(E)||x(¢) < 00
te[0,T]
endowed with the norm
T lp
(| 10) for p€[1, 00),
Wwe = ¥° (2.2)

esssup ||1(f)||x() for p= 00.
te[0,T]
Note that we made an abuse of notation after the definition of the first space and identified
u(t) = (ii(t), t) with ii(t). That (2.2) defines a norm is easy to see once one checks that the integrals
are well defined (the case p =o is easy), which can be shown by a straightforward adaptation


of the proof of theorem 2.8 in [6] for the case when each X(t) is separable (see also electronic
supplementary material, S1) and the proof of lemma 3.5 in [14] for the non-separable case. The
fact that ae is a Banach space follows from lemma 2.3 below. Important notation 2.2. Given a function u€ Lk, the notation it will be used to mean the
pullback i(-) := ¢_,)u(-) € L?(0, T; Xo), and vice versa.
