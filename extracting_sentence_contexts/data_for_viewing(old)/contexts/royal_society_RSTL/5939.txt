It is desirable in the first place to obtain a clear idea of an ordinary or non-generative
 *egmental organ in this worm. The following description is drawn from minute
J researches conducted with care by the author himself. Not having seen the original

J paper of GEGENBAVER*® on this subject, he cannot 8ay how far his own account may agree

SZ The xeason of the year, the state of the weather, have much to do with the condition
Sin which these organs are found. All the specimens upon which the following exami-
nations were instituted were taken in the months of J uly and August, from a rich,
&loamy, highly-cultivated garden oil.

S This fact it is material to know, since nowhere, in the ordinary fields and meadows,

Zin that condition which is required for the successful prosecution of these researches.
