(b) Bias of the noisy local time-varying reproduction number : So

We quantify the bias of the noisy local time-varying reproduction number in (2.3) when 28
misidentification occurs. We begin by defining a model for Tlecal (t) and [imported (f), Let ay denote Dw
the probability that an imported case is misidentified as local, and a the probability that a local 2
case is misidentified as imported. Then, a simple model is [8

~ Bin(E°!(t), 1 — a1) + Bin(™POeS(#), og) (2.6)
and Fimported (p) — plocalp) 4 jimported py _ Flocal (py,

Under independence, the first relationship in (2.6) is directly obtained by the definition of ag and
a. And the second equation in (2.6) is due to the fact that the total number of cases reported at
time t is not affected by the misidentification.

By (2.6), the relationship between jolt) and pl?<al(t) is
