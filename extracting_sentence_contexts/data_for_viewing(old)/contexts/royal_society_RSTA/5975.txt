is in a non-ergodic stationary state where the mean income is not conserved. This leads to the
emergence of ‘lucky’ individuals whose income grows over time just because of the randomness
in the system, whereas the income of the typical individual remains a static observable.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we investigated the impact of non-ergodicity on the individual income dynamics,
with the aim to evaluate the role of randomness in the observed rise in income inequality and
the decline in mobility all over the world. Similar to previous works dealing with inequality and
mobility, we used the properties of srGBM, an established model for non-ergodic income growth.
The fact that in srGBM, the extent of non-ergodicity is manifested via different regimes, allowed
us to perform a theoretical analysis for the behaviour of income inequality and mobility measures.
This, in turn, aided us in devising an empirical test for investigating the presence of different
regimes in real-world income dynamics.

We showed that different regimes also appear in the behaviour of inequality measures, but
not in the dynamics of mobility measures. That is, the dynamics of income inequality may range
from a strictly non-ergodic state in which this phenomenon empirically is always increasing, up
to a stable regime where inequality is steady and the system efficiently mimics ergodic behaviour.
Mobility measures, on the other hand, are always stable over time, just reach a different stationary
value, suggesting that economies become less mobile in non-ergodic regimes. This is eventually
translated in the dynamical behaviour of the Great Gatsby curve, i.e. the visual method for
describing the relationship between inequality and mobility.
