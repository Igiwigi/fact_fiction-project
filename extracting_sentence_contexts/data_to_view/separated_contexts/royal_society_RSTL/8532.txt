+ I am aware that tho conclusion here stated, and which scems to me well established by the above facts,
apparently stands in diametric contradiction to the conclusions which Heraaxy (f Archiv fiir Physiologie,‚Äù
Band x. Hefte 2 & 3, p. 77) has arrived at from a few similar experiments on the motor centres of the brain of
dogs. He concludes that because dogs ultimately recover completely from such disturbances of motor func-
tions as are a firs caused by the ablation of cortical centres, these centres cannot be motor in the true sense
of the term. Experiments on dogs, however, are not strictly comparable with experiments on monkeys ; and
the relative subordination and association of lower centres in different animals is a fact which ought to be
carefully considered.
