(a) Catalysis

A catalyst is a material which increases the rate, by
lowering the activation energy barrier, of a chemical
reaction without being consumed itself (e.g. [1]) (e.g.

can change the reaction mechanism and can direct the
m.tromp@uva.nl reaction to form desired products specifically. Our daily
life as it is now, with the products and materials we
use, would not exist without catalysis. In fact, over
90-95% of all commercial chemical processes use one or
more catalysts. Perhaps the most well-known catalyst
example is the catalyst in our car: it converts toxic
exhaust gases from the engine into more environmentally
friendly gases. Large industrial processes for bulk
chemicals use heterogeneous catalysts to, for example,
synthesize nitric and sulfuric acids. The fine chemical
industry, like the pharmaceutical, fragrance and flavour
