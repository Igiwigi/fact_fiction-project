Thus the 13 galvanometric readings with
a glass prism, and 6 readings with a quartz prism, in the infra-red spectrometer, gave
the following differences between the observed and calculated rotations :—

Casual errors + moe = + 0-012°/mm. Systematic error .. mous = — 0:0005°/mm. More important is the fact that, in the region of maximum sensitiveness, four readings
with the glass prism showed a casual error of -+ 0-001°/mm. and a systematic error of
+ 0-001°/mm. at wave-lengths ranging from 16,600 to 18,600 A.U., whilst four similar
readings with the quartz prism showed a casual error of + 0-005°/mm., and a systematic
error of — 0-002°/mm. at wave-lengths ranging from 20,000 to 24,000 A.U. Since
these systematic errors are considerably smaller than the expected error of reading,
there can be no doubt that in this region also the equation cited above represents the
data completely, within the limits of accuracy of the measurements now recorded. Whilst,
therefore, the errors of reading vary considerably in different portions of the spectrum,
and are naturally greater at the extreme limits than in the central portion, we can claim
that the rotatory power of quartz at 20° C. is expressed by the equation

within limits which in no part of the spectrum appreciably exceed + 0-002°/mm., or
1° on the total rotation of our long column of quartz, and which under favourable condi-
tions fall to less than one-half of this amount.
