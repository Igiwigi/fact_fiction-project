It is to be noticed, however, that
McClenahan indicates in a sagittal half of the rostrum illustrated in figure 14 the presence
of spines on the floor of the rostrum as well as on the roof. In a transverse section illustrated
in figure 17, however, no such ventral spines are apparent, and no spines have been found
in this situation in Calandra. Both Ting (1933) and Murray & Tiegs (1935) refer to the
pharynx as the oesophagus, in spite of the fact that Ting mentions the ‘oesophagus’ as
possessing backwardly directed spines, and Murray & Tiegs illustrate the pharyngeal
dilator muscles.

(iii) The nerves and tracheae of the rostrum, and the ducts of the salivary glands. Dorsal to the
pharynx a median longitudinal blood channel (figure 10, h.m.) is separated from the
remainder of the haemocoele by laterally disposed membranous walls. Each wall is double,
its two layers enveloping the dilator muscles of the pharynx but being elsewhere closely
applied to each other (figure 10).
