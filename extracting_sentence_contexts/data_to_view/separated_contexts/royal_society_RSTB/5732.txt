+ Scorr (1912, p. 380) mentions a petiole of Htapleris Scotti associated with the Botrychioxylon, but
adds that there is also an Ankyropteris. The latter, however, can scarcely have belonged to the Botry-
chioxylon. The facts now brought forward make this all the more unlikely, and at the same time enhance
the possibility that Htapleris Scotti was the petiole of B. paradoxum (which may thus ultimately have to be
re-named Zygopteris Scotti), But no one would assert this without further evidence.

} Ina stem of this habit the great development of secondary wood is difficult to explain physiologically ;
perhaps it is a useless legacy from some erect ancestor. BETWEEN GENERA ZYGOPTERIS, ETAPTERIS AND BOTRYCHIOXYLON.
