edu.pl Plant cells harbour two types of energy organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Despite the fact that both these organelles have their own genomes, the majority of
organellar proteins are nuclear encoded. Thus, to maintain organelle functions
and to coordinate the expression of organellar and nuclear genes specific mechan-
isms have evolved, classified as anterograde and retrograde control. The
anterograde control involves the regulation of organellar gene expression by
nuclear-encoded proteins, whereas retrograde control involves signals originating
from the organelles causing nuclear transcriptional reprogramming [1].
