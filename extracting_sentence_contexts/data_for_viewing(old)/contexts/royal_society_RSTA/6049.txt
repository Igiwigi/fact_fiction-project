(a) The prestress state is far from the PD and SE boundaries, p ~ {3.32955, 0}. (b) The prestress state belongs to both the PD
and SE boundaries (coinciding for uniaxial stress), p,, * {6.65910, 0}; in this case, the reported incremental deformation is a
zero-energy mode for the effective material. (Online version in colour.)

that under uniaxial tension, loss of PD for the homogenized incremental constitutive operator
coincides with loss of strong ellipticity SE.

Similarly to figure 1, figures 7 and 8 report both the incrementally deformed grid and the
corresponding incrementally deformed effective material (shown in orange). From both figures,
the following conclusions can be drawn:

(i) The bending moments applied at the ends of the rods correspond to a null mean stress
and therefore do not provide any effect on the boundary of the effective material. In fact,
this effect is a higher-order contribution within the homogenization scheme adopted here,
so that it could be highlighted only in a higher-order description employing Cosserat or
Mindlin continua for the effective material.

(ii) At loss of PD, the effective material admits incremental deformations corresponding to
zero second-order energy. For these deformations (addressed in the figures), an element
of the effective material is subject to an incremental strain with null surface tractions.
