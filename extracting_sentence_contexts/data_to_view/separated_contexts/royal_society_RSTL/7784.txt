But it
may be preferable to write (3z, 3y, . ..) =a(&, y,. . .). Tn particular if k=m, then the
increments are connected by a linear m-fold relation; that is, the ratio of the increments
is uniquely determined; and as the relation is satisfied by taking the increments propor-
tional to the coordinates, it is clear that the yalues which the linear m-fold relation gives
for the increments are in fact proportional to the coordinates: viz. there is not in this
case any consecutive point.

67. Considering the Ã¾-fold relation as belonging to a &-fold locus in the m-space, 80
that (, y, .. .)'are
