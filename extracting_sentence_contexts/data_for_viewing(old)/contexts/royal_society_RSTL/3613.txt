M. Mvuruer. © The existence of vessels in the substance of the cornea is doubtful;
they have never been injected. Nevertheless, penetrating ulcers and granulations are
formed in the cornea, which can scarcely be conceived to occur without the agency
of vessels. I have repeatedly seen in Calves of nearly the full time, vessels in the
conjunctiva of the cornea, which contained red blood, and which could with a lens be
traced more than a line over the margin of the cornea. HEeNLE has injected these
vessels; in the conjunctiva of the cornea they measured 55545th to 54;th of an inch,
and the finest twigs were not then injected ; their trunks, which arose from a circular
vessel that ran around the cornea, were even somewhat larger than this. The pre-
parations of these parts I have in my possession. Professor RerTzius has, by means
of injection, been able to see the same thing in the adult animal.

* All these facts, however, render it very probable, that even the cornea and capsule
of the lens, to which vasa serosa have been hitherto ascribed, are really provided with
vessels carrying red blood. The vessels of the corneal conjunctiva are certainly less
numerous than those of the sclerotic conjunctiva; there is the same difference between
these two parts as between that part of the synovial membrane which is free, and that
which covers the articular cartilage||.”
