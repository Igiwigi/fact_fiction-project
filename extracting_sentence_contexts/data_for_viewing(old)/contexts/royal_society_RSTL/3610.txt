come in contact with the mass of delicate cells described by Scawanx as situated be-
tween the lens and the capsule.

The mode of nutrition of the erystalline lens may be explained, by supposing that
the nutrient fluid is received by the cells just alluded to, and conducted to the lens
(perhaps has its characters changed in its course by the metabolic functions ascribed to
them by M. Scawaxx) through which it is diffused. It has been stated, that the pre-
sence of hlood-vessels in the cornea, the anterior half of the capsule of the crystalline
lens, and in the substance of the lens itself, appears to be incompatible with their
function of transmitting the rays of light to the retina, Nevertheless large vessels
ramify on the posterior half of the capsule. The knowledge of the existence of this
arrangement, of vessels led me to perform some experiments with lenses, from which
I have deduced the fact, that objects (radiating lines, for instance) situated on the
anterior surface of the crystalline lens, produce an indistinctness in the image which
is formed upon the retina ; whereas, when these lines exist upon the posterior surface
of the lens, the image is perfectly clear.

3. The Vitreous Body or Humour.

Structure, —The vitreous humour is composed of cellular cavities which are filled
with a transparent fluid. The membrane of which the walls of these cells are com-
posed,—the tunic of the vitreous humour,—is very delicate, and is interspersed with
corpuscles.
