and the latter depressed below it.

Conceive this result due to the action of an elevating force represented by +40 +20
opposed by a depressing one represented by — 39 —21, and we have a sufficient expla-
nation of this anomalous circumstance, while at the same time both the antagonistic
forces sufficiently present the normal type.

34. The same style of reasoning will apply in comparing the declination curve with
that of either force; only here we must suppose that the one force affects the declination
in a s0omewhat different manner from its antagonist, 80 that the proportion between a
declination peak and one of either force is not 80 constant as that between peaks of the
two forces. The idea of two antagonistic forces, the difference of which represents the
visible action, seems also to give the simplest explanation of the fact, that sometimes a
force which depresses one of the elements will change in the course of a few hours to
one which elevates it—since otherwise we must suppose the disturbing force to have
changed its character.

This also is the view of disturbing forces which General Saprxs, who has studied the
subject 80 long and 80 successfully, has lately been disposed to adopt on other grounds;
and I am happy to think that the idea herein advocated is that of one whose judgment
is 80 mature and whose information is 80 extensive.

39. Adopting this view of the 8ubject, it is worthy of remark that the same element
of the disturbing forces (the declination) which changes 80 much its comparative value
from one disturbance to another, changes also the most of the three when we pass from
