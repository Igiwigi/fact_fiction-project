(1) Find examples of non-Kolmogorovian data outside quantum mechanics. [=
(2) Produce non-trivial experimentally verified predictions based on non-Kolmogorovian 3
models in sciences like economy, biology, engineering, . . ..

Problem (1) was formulated by me as an open challenge to the participants of the conference fo
Quantum Probability and Noncommutative Geometry (August 2000, Nottingham Trent University). a]
The first results in this direction confirm the existence of such data [27,28]. Problem (2) is more DN
difficult and to my knowledge open at the moment, but active research in this direction is 1B
currently being developed mainly by A. Khrennikov and his group. [8

(d) Probability, information and measurements

The fact that any probability is a conditional probability has been emphasized by many
authors (e.g. [29]): it is conditioned on the information available at a given moment. Thus the
object of probability theory is to optimally use available information at a given moment to
make predictions on the future in conditions of incertitude. Usually the available information
is considered fixed and omitted from the notation. Conditioning is the dynamical aspect of
probability theory. It has to do with the following problem: if, at a given moment, the available
information changes, how should statistical predictions change? In classical probability this
change is described by Bayesâ€™ formula. But this formula implies that the process of acquisition
of information is cumulative (acquisition of new information improves but does not destroy the
old one) (see [18] for a quantitative discussion of this point).

The main difference between classical and quantum probability is that in the latter theory
this process may not be cumulative, in the sense that acquisition of new information may alter
