The disadvantage is
that there is a risk of self-reversal or self-absorption occurring in the lines. It can
be observed directly that there is no self-reversal for the visible and ultra-violet lines
of krypton when the tube is viewed end-on. The fact that the exposure is so
greatly reduced when the tube is viewed end-on leads one to suppose that there is
at any rate no serious self-absorption for these lines. The risk of change of wave-length through self-absorption is brought about by
the isotopic nature of krypton. For if there is an isotope shift present in the lines,
which is too small to be resolved, self-absorption would cause a change in the
position of the centre of gravity of the lines; because the self-absorption is stronger
for the components due to the elements present in the greatest proportion, and with
an asymmetrical pattern would shift the centre of gravity towards that of the weaker
lines.
