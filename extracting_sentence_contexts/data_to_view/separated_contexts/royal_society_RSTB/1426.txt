Long subseque
and more complete specimens were discovered, and a full account of the wholes
was laid before the Royal Society in 1887. We have re-examined the sp ec
the purposes of the present paper, but, except in one point, have nothing t
the previous descriptions. A summary, however, of the facts relating to this fructification must be gi
for the sake of comparison with the structure of Calamostachys. The strobilus of the “ Calamitean” fructification was pedunculate, and con
an axis bearing numerous whorls of bracts, which were coherent for some
from their insertion, the coherent part forming the “disk” of previous deserii
The bracts after leaving the axis at a right angle, or with a slightly d
curvature, turned sharply upwards, their superior portions becoming appro
parallel to the axis. ;

The sporangiophores were borne at the base of the coherent bracts, on th
surface, and were thus very nearly axillary.
