Indeed,
it is well-known that DP mixtures can introduce many small extra clusters. To overcome this,
Guha et al. [147] develop a post-processing procedure to consistently estimate the true number
of components by suitably truncating components with small weights and merging similar
components. Instead, consistency can also be achieved by adapting the concentration parameter
a of the DP to be sample-size dependent or via a suitable hyperprior, which is in fact standard
in practice [149,150]. Furthermore, Frithwirth-Schnatter & Malsiner-Walli [151] illustrate that the
choice of the hyperprior on the weights is far more influential on the number of clusters than
whether an overfitted or DP mixture is considered. In practice, we can expect that mixture models are misspecified in some way; either in the
kernel or mixing measure, or both.
