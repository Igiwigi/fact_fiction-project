a film was formed upon the surface, which appeared to be of
an oily nature, and Mr. BranDE ascertained it to be 80. The
quantity was not great, but quite sufficient to ascertain the
fact, and next day the fzces having subsided, the fatty film
was much more conspicuous. In the Phil. Trans. for 167g,
Pp. 609g, a case is stated of a person who Iaboured under an
indisposition, attended with sickness and vomiting. In one
attack of vomiting, he brought up matter resembling tallow,
four pieces of which weighed half an ounce.

This process of forming fat in the lower intestines by means
of bile, throws considerable light upon the nourishment de-
rived from clysters, a fact well ascertained, but which could
not be explained. It also accounts for the wasting of the body,
which 50 invariably attends upon all complaints of the lower
bowels. It accounts, too, for all the varieties in the turns of
the colon, which we meet with in 80 great a degree in diffe-
rent animals. This property of the bile explains likewise the
formation of fatty concretions in the gall-bladder, 80 com-
monly met with, and which, from these experiments, appear
to be produced by the action of the bile on the mucus secreted
in the gall-bladder : and it enables us to understand the fol-
lowing effects, which arose from the circumstance of no part
of the bile passing into the intestines,
