3. The first obvious experiment was to ascertain whether cyanide of potassium
charged with nitric oxide would produce prussides exerting the remarkable colouring
action on the sulphides. Nitric oxide is in fact readily absorbed by cyanide of potas-
Sum, the solution becoming red-coloured and depositing a black substance resem-
bling paracyanogen. This red-coloured solution did not of itself give any colour
when mixed with a sulphide. It was now converted into a prusside by the addition
of protosulphate of iron.
