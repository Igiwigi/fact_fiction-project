But I have met with perfect
bilateral symmetry in specimens warranted as Amphistegine by those excellent judges of that type.

+ T have not yet been able to satisfy myself as to the precise affinities of Pusulina, the metamorphic con-
dition of its shell interfering with the minute study of its structure ; but my view of its nature essentially
correzponds with that of Messrs, ParxeR and RueerT JoxEs. (See Quart, Journ. of Geol. Soe., Nov. 1860,
P- 458.)


CONCLUDING SUMMARY :—EXTENT OF RANGE OF VARIATION. 577

of the body are much more jsolated from each other than they are in the type already
described ; and the proper walls of the chambers seem, as it were, to be moulded upon
the segments, instead of merely filling up the interspaces between them. This filling-up,
in fact, is the office of the © intermediate skeleton,” which gives a solidity to the whole
aggregation that would otherwise be wanting ; and special provision, as we have seen,
is made in the canal-system for its nutrition. Altogether this type is the one in which
the Foraminiferous structure attains its highest development, and which is most com-
pletely differentiated from every other. And the morphological yariations it is known
to undergo seem to me fully to justify the inference, that snch further variations as
have been shown to occur in the Orbiculine type might be regarded as the probabl

source- of the divergence, from some common ancestral stock, of the several forms
whose intimate relationship I have demonstrated.
