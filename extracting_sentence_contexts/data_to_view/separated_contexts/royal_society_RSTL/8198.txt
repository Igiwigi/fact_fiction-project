OSTEOLOGY OF THE HYOPOTAMID X. 65

the Museums of Lausanne and Puy T had no doubt whatever that the genus imperfectly
known under the names of 7/yopotamus and Bothriodon had four completely developed
digits on both extremities; and all I had seen in the collections of Puy confirmed this
inference; besides, as I could not find any difference in the dental or osteological
characters between these two supposed genera, I was obliged to unite them, giving
priority to Professor Owex's denomination, But, whilst studying the fossil remains
from Hordwell and Hempstead in the collection of the Britigh Museum, I gradually
acquired the conviction that we have, in the English deposits, two very different forms of
the same natural family, which, though entirely similar in most of their osteological
characters presented a wide difference in the composition of their manus and pes,
a difference somewhat similar to the difference we see in our own times between
Hyomoschus and the true Ruminants. One form had clearly four completely developed
digits, while the other had only two. At first T struggled against this conclusion, as the
fact seemed too singular, considering the similarity of all the other bones of the skeleton ;
but by-and-by, as I got more materials, all doubt cleared away; and having once ascer-
tained this point, I felt obliged to snbdivide the family of Hyopotamide into two
groups or genera, Diplopus and Hyopotamus, whose chief distinction lay in the number
of digits. It is more than probable that each group or genus was represented by
8everal species, though this specific distinction is very difficult to establish. But I shall
return to this question at the end of my memoir; at present I proceed with the descrip-
tion of the bones forming the metacarpus and metatarsus in both genera.
