majority votes.

The central construct for a C” basis is what I call a ranking wheel. As indicated in figure 1, this
rotating wheel lists ranking numbers, 1 to n, uniformly along the wheel’s edge. Place the names of
the n alternatives on the wall. The ranking wheel number adjacent to a name identifies its ranking
position. To obtain the next ranking, rotate the wheel to place ‘1’ by the next alternative. Continue
until ‘1’ has been by each name; this defines a set of rankings. Illustrating with figure 1, the set is

A>B>C>D>E, B>C>D>E>A, C>D>E>A>B, (23)
2.3
D>E>A>B>C, E>A>B>C>D.
That these terms must play a central role in developing a comprehensive theory for voting is
suggested by the fact that the top row of equation (2.3) was used to create the equation (2.1)
example with its cyclic behaviour.


A ranking wheel array is a Z; orbit of a ranking. By construction, each candidate is in first,
second, ..., last place precisely once, so no candidate is favoured: The outcome should be a tie. But
by ignoring the full symmetry structure, pairwise outcomes define a cycle. The D > E ranking, for
instance, appears in the first four equation (2.3) rankings; only in the last is E > D, which leads to
an overwhelming D > E victory of 4:1. (So P(D, E) = 3.) Reflecting the cyclic action of the ranking
wheel, the cyclic majority vote outcome is

A>B, B>C, C>D, D>E, E>A, (2.4)
