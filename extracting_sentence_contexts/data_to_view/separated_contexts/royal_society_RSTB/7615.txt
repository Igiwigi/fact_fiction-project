For the reconstruction shown in figure 5 I depended chiefly on the observations made
on the detached branches of various sizes and their interrelationship as shown in table 1. In this table the branches are arranged under different size groups, and each group has
been assigned a definite order. These branches of each order are easily recognized by the
structure and size of the steles. â€˜The branches show a fine graduation in size, a fact which
suggests that the frond of Stauropteris tapered gradually, both upwards as well as laterally. Also the branches of the frond show a definite relationship with one another. A petiole
gives out a pair of branches 1-6 to 1-28 mm in diameter, the latter produces branches
1 mm in diameter, which give out branches 0-64 mm in diameter and so on.
