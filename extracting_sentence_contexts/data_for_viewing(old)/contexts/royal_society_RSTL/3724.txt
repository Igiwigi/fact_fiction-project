the trae law could only, in fact, arise from the minute residual quantity of the more
extinguisbable rays existing at great thicknesses ; quantities 80 small that the law of
their variation would be lost in the errors of observation.

87. The analogy of the case of light will perhaps illustrate this important consider-
ation. Suppose solar light to be incident upon intensely red glass: at very minute
thicknesses soime part of eyery kind of light will, no doubt, pass through, but we know
that the old veneered homogeneous glass transmits pure red light, even when it is
very thin indeed. At still greater thicknesses only red light will be transmitted, and
that with as great freedom, perhaps, as common window-glass permits the passage of
white light. The intensity then of the red light, for which the glass is perfectly trans-
parent, indicates the residual constant quantity, towards which the transmitted beam
continually approximates, and which is yery far from zero of intensity. But it is
