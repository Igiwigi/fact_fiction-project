as quartz, blue corundum or sapphire, zircon, garnet, &c. some-
times show, by fortunate accidental fractures, or other natural
accidents, the direction of the crystalline laminz of which they
- are composed. Quartz, for instance, is s0metimes found with an
evidently laminated appearance, particularly the blue variety,
which is brought to us either from Canada or ſrom the East
Indies; but never yet was an appearance of this nature perceived
in any kind of calcedony.

Many celebrated mineralogists, amongst whom may be men-
tioned the Abbe Havy, seem to explain this want of crystalli-
zation in calcedony, by considering that substance as nothing
more than quartz in a concrete state. This is, in fact, supposing
it a sort of irregular crystallization, which bears the same ana»
logy to quartz, that calcareous alabaster bears to crystallized
carbonate of lime. I cannot, however, by any means adopt this
opinion, as it does not appear to me to agree with those facts
which nature permits us to observe; for, not to mention those
kinds of quartz which are produced by a disturbed crystallization,
