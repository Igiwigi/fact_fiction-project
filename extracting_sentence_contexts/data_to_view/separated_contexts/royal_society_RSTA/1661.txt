They only complicate the process. The new lander can deploy a rover to go over
to the prime site. In fact, PTScientists planned to do this for their first lunar lander mission. Their
rover had only a small fraction of the mass of the lander, and so would have carried far more
limited equipment. As this will likely be generally true of rovers, the ability to engage in resource
utilization by the later arrival will be significantly hampered.
