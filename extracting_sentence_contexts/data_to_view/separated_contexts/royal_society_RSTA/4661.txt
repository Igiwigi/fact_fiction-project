For the smooth case, the solution u‘
will converge to u in some reasonable space, and at least pointwise. Define the corresponding
function uj, as in (2.1), with = (h,...,hy,1,0). Then similar reasoning as in the previous case
along with the fact that gy. is independent of tangential direction t L en implies D2 uf, >—-C. The

5This simple argument has been unnoticed until now. As v © x7/2, for this case, we have to work with second derivatives of v,

so that D.V ~ a; — x3/2 > 0.
