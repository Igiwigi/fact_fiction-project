from 80 to 160 » in transverse diameter. They are usually quite short, shorter than
they are broad (Plate 31, Phot. 81). Occasionally longer cells may be found near the
xylem-strands, but this is not regularly the case. ‘Ihe walls of the pith-cells are
perceptibly thinner than those of the tracheides ; little triangular spaces are present
where three cells meet.

Here and there large sacs or cavities occur in the pith ; one of them, of a roundish
form, is shown in Phot. 31 near the bundle; others are of a more elongated shape.
They commonly show traces of broken-down cell-walls at the edges. It is very
doubtful whether these cavities existed as such during life.

Tt will thus be seen that the pith was a perfectly typical one, remarkable only for
the fact that it was traversed by strands of primary xylem.

Course of the Xylem-strands.—A series of 24 transverse sections was cut for us
by Mr. W. Hemingway, the length of the piece cut having been 25 mm. (one inch).
This series has been of great value in tracing the course of the xylem-strands, as all
the sections except one show more or less of the pith. At the beginning of the series
more than half is shown, the area diminishing somewhat towards the other end. One
of Mr. Lomax’s sections immediately precedes the first of this series, and serves to
extend it.

Unfortunately nothing is shown of the exit of leaf-trace bundles. At two places
local interruptions in the continuity of the secondary wood have been observed, but
there is no proof that they are connected with outgoing strands.
