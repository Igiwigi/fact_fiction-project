Na.

Although the readings for NaD are very inexact, the peculiarity of the large
depression shown for m = 6, as well as the large recovery afterwards to mantisse
close to unity, must be real effects. It is of course possible that NaD, (6) isa
collateral from the normal type. If D, (6) be calculated from D, (6)—», the mantissa
becomes *989054, in other words, the D, line begins to show the rise to the large
final value at m = 6, whilst D, does not do so until m =7. The D, lines would seem
to succumb to the disturbing effects sooner than the D, It was pointed out in
[I., p. 83] that in the Na the D series apparently belongs to the F type, in which
the mantissa is ‘998613. It would almost seem that the peculiar rise shown is due
to the fact that it reverts to this F sequence. Here, as we shall see in other cases,
the values of the first members of these series appear to be subject to some kind of
displacement which affects their (supposedly) normal relations to other lines. If now
the first mantissa be supposed normally to be this 998613, it is 9691 above that in
the modified table, and this is 134+32, thus completing the order differences as
multiples of A. But in any case the data for Na are of small use for the present
purpose, as the errors are so large, and A so small. The arrangement in the table
