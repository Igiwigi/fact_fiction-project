Connecting the Bell scenario with the OP
defined above, one can identify each joint measurement with a context. The assumption of non-
contextuality, then, amounts to the fact that the outcome of Aj; is independent of whether it is
measured together with B, or By, and similarly for B; with respect to Aj, Ag. In the Bell scenario,
the assumption of non-contextuality is justified by the fact that measurements are chosen and
performed in space-like separated space-time regions, hence, they cannot influence each other, as
any ‘disturbance’ from Alice to Bob, or vice versa, would need to travel faster than light. Elaborating on this idea, non-contextuality inequalities similar to Bell inequalities have been
developed (e.g. [26-30]) and subjected to experimental tests (e.g. [31-33]). These inequalities
involve correlations among measurements for which some property of non-disturbance is
assumed.
