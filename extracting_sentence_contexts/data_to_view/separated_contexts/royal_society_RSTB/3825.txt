This would tend to show that the normal arrangement
preponderates in the recovery, and this may be open to the interpretation that a
certain amount of education is necessary, in the case where non-corresponding ends
have been united, before function can be carried out. It was noticed that although when the musculo-spiral served as source of supply,
the ability to walk was earlier regained, still the leg did not gain in bulk and in
strength so quickly as in the case where the source of supply was the musculo-
cutaneous, median and ulnar combination, This again is what might be expected
in view of the greater bulk of the nerves forming the source of supply in the latter
ease. The facts then would be explained by assuming that where one centre is
made to supply not only its own muscles, but also a group antagonistic in action
to its own muscles, a quicker recovery takes place in the case of the normal
distribution than in the case of the new distribution which the experimental
arrangement seeks to establish. Recoveries of co-ordinated movements after experimental alteration of the innerva-
tion are simplified when considered in the light of present-day views as to the
nature of correlated action of antagonistic muscles. This has within recent years
been worked out by SHerrineron (13-29) in his long series of papers on reciprocal
innervation of antagonistic muscles.
