[. THE THEORY OF EQUATIONS OF THE FIFTH ORDER. 267

| | © to explain the formation of a set, consider the symbols 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as belonging to
five points. We may with these five points form in all (4.1.2.3.4=)12 pentagons, and
the symbol 12345 of any pentagon may of course be read backwards or forwards from
any point (12345=23451=&ec.=15432=&.) without alteration of its meaning. Now
attaching to each arrangement of the five numbers a sign, + or —, according to the
ordinary rule of signs, 12345 being as usual positive, the arrangements 12345, 23451,
&. .. 15432, &c., which belong to the same pentagon, have all of them the same sign ;
and we may consequently connect with each pentagon the sign + or — ; there are, in
fact, six pentagons with the 8ign + and six with the sign — ; and to each positive
pentagon there corresponds a negative pentagon, which is derived from it by stellation,
viz. to the positive pentagon 12345 there corresponds the negative one 24135, and 80
EW the other positive pentagons. The above-mentioned system of equations

A fact exhibits the six positive pentagons, each accompanied by its stellated negative
Yentagon, and the formation of the system of equations is thus completely explained ;
