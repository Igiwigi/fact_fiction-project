When the lesser zenith-distance is the argument for the vertical column, the sign
given in the Table was retained, in the other case the 8ign was changed; in this way all
the errors come to stand on one side of the diagonal as they are in the Table, and on
the other side with changed signs. The vertical and horizontal columns were now
examined to see whether one particular sign predominated in any part. In fact the
following corrections of the yalues of pz were found to be indicated :—

412


598 THE EARL OF ROSSE ON THE RADIATION

Zen.-dist. Log correction.
29 — 0-0100
35 _ -0049
40 _ -0008

AS ene -0027
531 EZ -0050
= -0054
GOD -0032

65 _ -0011
70 =_ -0041
T5 = -0041
79 =_ -0082

The corrected curve was then found to intersect SEIDEL's at 38*2 and at 44*0, while it
was 0:0034 below it at 29*-0, and 00038 below it at 50*:0. On comparing the two curves
for the whole interval between 29” and 50?, the new curye was found to be exactly 0:0010
below SEIDEL'S on an average; and since, as has already been said, our observations do
not extend to within less than 29 of the zenith, this correction of +0-0010 was applied
to the whole of the Table deduced from the new curve.
