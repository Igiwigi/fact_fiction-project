The Ceylon flora contains 149 families, with 1027 genera and 2809 species, of
Angiosperms (sens Hooker), 58 with 105 genera and 196 species contain no
endemic forms, but these are mostly small families. The average number of species
in a family in Ceylon is 19, and the only family with more than 19 that contains no
endemics is the Capparidaceze with 20. It may be noticed here, as a fact that has
possibly some bearing on the mechanism of evolution, that this family contains nine
species endemic to Ceylon and South India, a very large proportion. The only other
families of any important size without endemics are the Menispermaceze and Solanacez
with 13 species each, the Ficoidexe with 11, the Lentibulariacese and Polygonaceze
with 10 each, while there is 1 family with 8, 1 with 7, 1 with 6, 2 with 5, 1 with 4,
10 with 8, and 18 each with 2 and 1 species. The families with the most endemic species, arranged in order, are :â€”
