The (7,/T,, t’/$7) curves are useful for describing, in general terms, the motion at a
point abscissa x in the bar when an infinite pressure of infinitely short duration, built up
of stress waves of all possible wave-lengths, is released at the origin at time ¢’ = 0. If dis-
persion were absent, all the waves would arrive simultaneously at the point at time’ = $7),
giving an exact reproduction of the original pulse, whilst the (7}/T,, ¢’/27)) curve would
consist of a vertical straight line of abscissa unity, extending from 7;/T), = 0 to T,/T,, = 00.

Considering only the vibrations represented by the first mode, the curve (1) in figure 15
extends from 1’ = 37), to ¢’ = 2-64($7)), showing that a pulse propagated in this mode,
originally of infinitely short duration, is distorted as it passes down the bar into a disturbance
of duration 1-64(}7)). Since $7) = x/co, it is clear that the duration of the disturbance in-
creases progressively with distance from the origin. The finite duration of the disturbance
is clearly due to the fact that the (¢,/c),a/A) curve of figure 14 shows a minimum which
corresponds to a value of ¢,/¢y differing from zero.

As regards the sequence of events at a given point in a bar, it follows from curve (1) of
figure 15 that when’ = $7, the dominant group at the point is composed of very long waves,
all of which have travelled with the same velocity ¢). As ¢’ increases, the values of J, and a/A
decrease, showing that the infinitely long waves are followed by shorter waves. We would
therefore expect the (pressure, time) curve at a given point to consist of a pulse which may
be regarded as a highly distorted form of the main pulse, followed by a tail consisting of
oscillations of high frequency; since the waves mainly concerned in the propagation of
sharp discontinuities have short wave-lengths, the infinitely sharp discontinuities present
in the original pulse will be rounded off.
