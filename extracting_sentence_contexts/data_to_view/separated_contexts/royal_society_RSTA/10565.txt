The value of 4 at any point O outside $8, and at time ¢, can be expressed as a

where dv denotes the element of the normal to dS drawn outwards (7.e., into the
region of space where O is situated), and the expressions in square brackets [ ] are to
be formed, for each point of the surface, at the time ¢— 7/c, 7 being the distance of
the point of the surface from the point O,

This theorem was obtained by Kircnuorr* by an application of GREEN’s theoremt
to the function ¢ and an auxiliary function V, which satisties the equation (1) at all
points except O, and has the form

F (r + Ct)

where F is a function to which suitable properties are assigned.

8. [Partly re-written March, 1901.|—If ¢ were the velocity potential of sound
waves in air, the terms of (2) that contain [¢] and [0¢/dr] would be interpretable in
terms of velocity, and those that contain [d¢/dt] would be interpretable in terms of
condensation ; the expression (2) would represent the motion at any point as due to
sources of definite types distributed over the surface 8. But, if ¢ is one of the
components of a vector quantity, propagated by transverse waves, [d¢/dv] has no
physical significance, and the expression (2) cannot be interpreted in terms of appro-
priate sources of disturbance. Again, the expression (2) may be interpreted as showing that every element of the
surface S becomes the centre of diverging secondary waves.
