Now all these substances are found in sea-water, but the proportions are quite different.

* The potash which T have mentioned here represents in fact not the mean of all the observations in the
great ocean, but only the mean of a number of determinations for the northern part of the Atlantic, my older
observations on the quantity of potash in the other parts of the ocean being not exact enough. This quantity
of potash differs most probably very little from the real mean.

244 PROFESSOR FORCHHAMMER ON THE COMPOSITION

The ocean is in fact such a lake, into which all the rivers carry what they have dissolved
from the land, and from which pure water evaporates; and whatever we think about
the constitution of the primitive ocean, this effect of the rivers, which has lasted for
thousands of years, must have had an influence upon the 8ea. Why do we not obserye
a greater influence of the rivers? Why does not lime, the prevailing base of river-water,
occur in a greater proportion in the water of the ocean ? In all river-water the number
of equivalents of sulphuric acid is much smaller than that of lime, and yet we find in
sea-water about three equivalents sulphuric acid to one of lime. There must thus be in
sea-water a constantly acting cause that deprivyes it again of the lime which the rivers
furnish, and we find it in the $hell fishes, the corals, the bryozoa, and all the other
animals which deposit carbonate of lime. From the proportion between sulphuric acid
and lime in river-water and in sea-water, it is evident that these animals are able not only
to deprive the water of its carbonate of lime, of which sea-water contains very little, but
