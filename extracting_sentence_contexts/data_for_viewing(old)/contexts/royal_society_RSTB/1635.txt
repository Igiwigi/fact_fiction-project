2On the other hand, in several abiormal Siluroids (e.y., Bagarivs, Akysis, Acro.
Bordowiehthys, Glyptosternum, Euclyptosteraum, &.) the air-bladder has so far
idergone retrogressive modification in one way or another as to haye been strne-
ly incapable of responding to variations of external pressure, or of initiating any
Bovements in the chain of Weberinu ossicles. In all these Siluroids the atrophy of
te fibres forming the dorsal walls of the two lateral air-saes constitutes a structural
\Ssion so obvious that it is impossible that any alterations in the volume of the air-
Bladder could be converted inte corresponding movements of the Webetian mechanism
in any way affect the auditory organ. Iu such instances complete: encapsulation is,
& /iypothesi, minecessary, and therefore does nob take place. As suggested above,
partial enclosure of the air-bladder within mere grooves or recesses on the ventral
Birtaces of the modified transverse processes tay here be rewarded as simply due to
Bie fact that, us the organ lost its lateral compartments and the anterior chamber
wully became smuller, the transverse processes, still continued to retain their
April relations to the latter, while at the sume time contracting and more or less
eurvingy round it, On the other haud, there are one or two abnormal forms (eg.
Pinelodus puleher aud Sehilbichthys) in which encapsulation is but partial, although
the structural integrity of the air-bladder is so far maintained that ib might stil be
Susreptible to slight yolumetric changes when exposed Lo pressure variations, aud also
be able to convert sue changes of yolume into movements of the Weberian ossicles,
lint in these, and in one or two other similar cases, it will generally be found that
the bladder is so far environed by bone that no Iateral distension can take pliee.
This in the types referred to the osseous grooves are contracted distally in sich a
way as to effectually check all tendency to Jateral expansion on the part of the air.
