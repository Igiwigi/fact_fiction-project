chemotaxis” a subject of special investigation. Being satisfied, or assuming, th
the attracted leucocytes are phagocytic in property, they have considered it suffici
to prove that, in certain animals, by means of certain substances, or bacilli, leucoey t
ave attracted, and positive chemotaxis was considered to be of special use
phagocytosis, because it was tacitly understood that the leucocytes attracted to tH
spot were always active phagocytes. We shall now show that this conception is tr
in part only, and that the usefulness of the wandering cells in the conflict again
injurious substances does not lie wholly in their phagocytic powers.

We have seen that the Frog possesses three kinds of wandering cells. Of the
the eosinophile cells are never phagocytic, the hyaline cells, on the other hand, an
so. If, therefore, the usefulness of “ positive chemotaxis” in the battle again:
micro-organisms lies solely in the fact that thereby phagocytes are attracted,
hyaline cells should be the ones to appear on the battle-field. We found, however
that the cells which first collect in greatest number (or are attracted) are the eosine
phile ones, and that it is not until some time has elapsed that the hyaline ce
become evident.

On injecting a fresh culture of anthrax bacilli into the subcutaneous tissue of a
pithed Frog, and keeping it at the ordinary temperature, which was 12° C. at the
time these experiments were performed, and removing drops of lymph with a capilla:
pipette at intervals of half an hour, it was noticed that the leucocytes which firs
appeared were the eosinophile ones. They rapidly increased in number until
third or fourth hour after inoculation, and collected in masses around the bacilli.
From the third or fourth hour onwards hyaline cells become conspicuous, increasing
