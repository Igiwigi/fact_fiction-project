before the Royal Society in March, 1921,* could with certain adaptations be applied
to several of the specimens, and, although the necessary modifications detracted from
the accuracy obtainable, it was thought useful to do so.

For this test it is necessary to utilise standards similar in form to the testpieces
employed. So far, therefore, as standards of known specific magnetism could be
prepared similar to any of the Farapay specimens, possessing one flat surface, these
specimens could be tested as a whole without cutting them up. This naturally proved
most convenient in the case of the uniformly shaped specimens of the “ E ” group.

The results of the tests are recorded in Table VII. In considering these the approxi-
mate character of the test must be recognised, as also the indefinite condition as regards
heat treatment of most of the specimens. The fact, however, that none of the
specimens in this research contains any large proportion of an alloying element is
reflected in the generally high figures obtained for the specific magnetism, platinum
apparently having no pronounced effect in lowering the figure.
