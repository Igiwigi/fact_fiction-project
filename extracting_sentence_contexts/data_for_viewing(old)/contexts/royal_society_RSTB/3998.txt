eliminated are not those which are concerned with the characters of larvee which are
being used as a criterion of inheritance, while an application of his “incompatibility
theory ” would necessitate the assumption that the elimimated chromosomes are those
derived from the male parent.

3. In the hybrid #. miliaris? x HE. acutus for E. miliaris 2 x E. esculentus ¢
it is necessary to suppose that eggs which develop normally without elimination, and
those in which elimination occurs, all give rise to the same form of larve. As in the
cross 1. acutus 2 X E. miliaris ¢ , the eliminated chromosomes are not connected with
the larval characters.

It will be observed that all the explanations are entirely negative, each is based
upon an assumption for which at present there is no prospect of proof; in fact, it
must be admitted that these hybrids afford us no evidence in favour of the correlation
of definite larval characters with certain of the chromosomes,

Again, Baurzer’s explanation of the Antedon hybrid, and the application of his
principle to explain the hybrid 4. miliaris 2 x E. acutus $ and E. miliaris ¢
x E. esculentus ¢ , mullities his suggestions concerning the eliminated chromosomes in
the hybrid Strongylocentrotus ? x Spherechinus $. For if paternal chromosomes
can behave apparently normally in a hybrid and yet be so influenced by the foreign
cytoplasm as to be “latent ”—as in Hchinus 2 x Antedon ¢—then it is impossible
to decide whether those chromosomes which are not eliminated from the hybrid
Strongylocentrotus 2 X Spherechinus $ contain factors for larval inheritance but
which are “latent”; or whether these factors are located in those chromosomes
