The graft mass is hidden away below the mesoderm of the host and does not come sufficiently into contact
with the host ectoderm for an opportunity for induction to arise. The most anterior part of the graft mass consists mainly of notochord and perhaps a little somitic
mesoderm. This is the only part of the graft which comes near the host ectoderm, which is in fact slightly
thickened, but it is very doubtful if any significance can be attached to this thickening. More posteriorly,
fig. 56, Plate 26, the notochord is accompanied by somites and the neural tube appears. The notochord
is absent in the most posterior part of the graft, which consists of somitic mesoderm and neural
tissue.
