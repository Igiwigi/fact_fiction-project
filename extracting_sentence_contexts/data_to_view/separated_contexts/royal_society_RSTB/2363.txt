the sporangium or nucellus, so as to leave only a narrow opening or micropyle, at the
top. The fact that only a single megaspore or embryo-sac, occupying almost the
whole of the sporangial cavity, comes to perfection, much heightens the resemblance
to a true seed, especially when we find the embryo-sac filled with the prothallus or
endosperm. The presence of an integument is in itself far from conclusive; the
indusium of the megasporangium in Azolla is at least equally like an integument, yet
it does not constitute the organ a seed, for it does not permanently inclose the
megaspore. *
