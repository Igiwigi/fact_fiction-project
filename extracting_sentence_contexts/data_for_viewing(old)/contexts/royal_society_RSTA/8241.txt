important bearing on numerous researches in which RayLeIGH sought to avoid the
difficulties associated with the viscosity term in (1) by assuming viscosity to be opera-
tive in determining the type of the steady motion, but without effect on the subsequent
history of an arbitrary disturbance. In other words, RAYLEIGH simplified (1) by omitting
the term vV*¢, and then sought a solution on the assumption that U is a specified function
of y. A number of functions were tried,—among them the linear function which is the
actual form of U in the problem of this paper. Rayteicn’s conclusion was that the
steady motion is stable or unstable (for a fluid of vanishing viscosity) according as U,
regarded as a function of y, has a curvature which is or is not of one sign throughout the
breadth of the field. In the nature of the case, no question of a critical speed (or value
of ReyNoLps’ number) arises.

* Equation (1) with the term in y suppressed may in fact be regarded as expressing the constancy of €
for a particular element of the fluid.

11. A linear distribution of U may be regarded (since the “ curvature ” of U is every-
where zero) as a limiting case in which Ray.eten’s criterion leads to the conclusion
of neutral stability ; and in this sense his result supports the conclusion which we have
drawn from (17). But it may be questioned whether investigations on the lines pro-
posed by RayLeran can be expected to lead to results of any significance. Whatever
be the form of U (as a function of y), equation (17) can be obtained ; and if this equation
