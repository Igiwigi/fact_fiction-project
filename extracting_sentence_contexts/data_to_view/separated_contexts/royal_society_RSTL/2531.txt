the great facility with which terms in the disturbing function are arrived at by my
method, I have calculated one of those given by Professor Airy, and which is required
in the determination of his inequality of Venus; and I have arrived at the result which
he has given. The same method, with certain modifications, is applicable to the de-
velopment of the disturbing function in terms of the true longitudes. The terms in
the disturbing function which give rise to the secular inequalities of the elliptic con-
stants, when the terms of the order of the fourth powers of the eccentricities and
inclinations are retained, and higher powers of those quantities are neglected, are as
follows : and I propose, as they form, in fact, a system apart, to distinguish them by
the indices given in the left-hand column. * Philosophical Transactions, 1832, Part II,
