Nuculanidae, and the first duct, with the wide diverticula, in that family represents an
element in the digestive system added for the better digestion of the large food particles.
It is clear from the observations of Heath (1937) that the stomach and gut of Aci/a are
similar to those of Nucula.

There are no twisted coils of intestine adjacent to the ventral region of the stomach;
this may be explained by the shorter distance to which the stomach extends into the
base of the foot. The intestine does not extend so far anteriorly as in the Nuculanidae
but the coiling, always on the right side, is more complex (see fig. 9). Heath (1937)
has described and figured the condition in a variety of species of Nucula and Acila. The
coiling is most elaborate in Nucula ‘‘cancellata”. Heath produces evidence which in-
dicates that the more complex coiling is typical of animals living in the greatest depths.
In ignorance of the fact that in no Lamellibranch does the intestine absorb, he suggests
that, as nutritive material diminishes with depth, a more elongated intestine is neces-
sary for adequate digestion. The animals may certainly have to take in larger quan-
tities of bottom material at these depths to obtain sufficient nutriment, but the added
need for consolidation of the greater amount of waste material as faecal pellets seems
the most reasonable explanation for the greater length of the gut.

The histology of the intestine and rectum calls for no comment; the latter possesses
