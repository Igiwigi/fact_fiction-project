which serves temporarily as a receptaculum seminis.

3. The males die after impregnating the females with spermatozoa, and these females
then enter frit-fly larvee, probably through the skin. They remain within the host
through its metamorphoses, becoming parasitic in the abdominal cavity of the male
and female flies which finally emerge.

4, The female grows within the host to a comparatively large sausage-shaped organism.
Its reproductive organs occupy most of its body and it becomes viviparous.

5. The larvee passed into the body-cavity of the fly are recognisable quite early as
potential males and females, owing to the different appearance of the respective genital
primordia, and to the fact that the female possesses a special cell on the dorsal side of
the intestine destined to become the intestinal gland. Growth takes place in these
larvee, and they make their way after a time into the intestine of the fly, whence they
pass to the exterior via the anus.

6. The development of the gonad has been studied in detail in the growing male and
female larvee, as well as the subsequent growth of the femaleâ€™s reproductive organs after
she has become parasitic in the fly.

7. The presence of the parasite within the host generally results in the sterilisation of
the latter, by preventing the growth of the gonads in either sex. A few cases have been
observed in which the reproductive organs of the host are normal, and the parasite in
such cases is degenerate.
