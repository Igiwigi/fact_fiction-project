term correcting for the mass of the nucleus, is equal to the hydrogen constant R. The
factor M/(M +- m) differs very little from unity and has only a small influence on the
series constant. The so-called spark spectrum is produced when the exciting agency
is sufficiently powerful to remove one of the electrons out of the range of effective
action of the nucleus. The atom is then ionised, and the spectrum is produced by
one of the next outermost electrons. This interacts with the remainder of the atom,
which now has a net positive charge 2e, and the series constant becomes 4R. This
predicted change, as previously mentioned, was verified by the author in the Bakerian
Lecture of 1914. The theory further indicated that atoms which have lost two
electrons, or have become doubly ionised, would be found to be characterised by series
involving the constant 9R, and so on. The theoretical prediction has now been
verified in the case of silicon so far as trebly-ionised atoms, which have 16R for the
series constant. The degree of ionisation is, in fact, most surely indicated by the
value of the corresponding constant for the series.

Alternating Types of Series.

The theory further indicates that the spectra obtained at successive stages of ionisation
should vary in type. The familiar arc series of sodium, magnesium and aluminium,
together with the author's previous work on the spark spectrum of magnesium, and
PascHEN’s work on ionised aluminium* provide material for a nearly complete com-
parison with the four spectra of silicon. The relations to be expected may be shown
as follows :—-
