If we examine the fangs of temporary teeth when they are undergoing removal,
similar states to those described as existing in the portion of femur will be found
to obtain. A similar cellular mass will be seen to be closely applied to that surface
of the tooth which is in process of removal, and the surface itself will present the
characteristic emargination observed in the bone. When we connect these conditions
with the fact that the nucleated cells which form the embryo have the power of
appropriating the material which lies about them to the purpose of their own growth
and their conversion into the various animal tissues, it, is difficult to resist the belief
that the cells which lie in contact with wasting bone and dentine, take up those
tissues and use all or part of their element for the purposes of their own increase or
multiplication, or else form a medium through which they are passed into the cir-
culation. But as the process of absorption with concurrent development of cells is
most active in primary bone where but few vessels exist, the former hypothesis seems
the more probable. An objection may be raised to the supposition, that the bone is
absorbed by the cells, on the ground of the density of the former; but it must be
borne in mind, that as the density is gradually imparted to the bone through the
agency of the adjoining soft parts, there seems no good reason for disbelieving that
they may also be instrumental in its removal.
