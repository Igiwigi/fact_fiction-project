limit dynamics when an external control is added to the system, and it is supposed to have some
sparsity surprisingly remains a difficult task. In fact, the most immediate and perhaps natural
approach would be to assign as well to the finite-dimensional control u an atomic vector-valued
time-dependent measure

N
vy () = > Uj8(x,(t),v(t)

i=l
and consider a proper limit v for N + +00, leading to the controlled PDE
+0 View = Vy - (A * we + vd, (1.4)

where now v represents an external source field. Unfortunately, despite the fact that vy are
supposed to be the minimizers of certain cost functionals which may allow for the necessary
compactness to derive the limit vy â€” v, it seems eventually hard to design a cost functional
with a proper meaning in the finite-dimensional model and at the same time promoting a good
behaviour of the measure v. In fact, for the optimal control problems considered for instance
in [6, section 5], such a limit procedure does not prevent v being singular with respect to jp.
This means that in the weak formulation of the equation (1.4) the role of v is essentially mute,
it does not interact at all with , hence it loses completely its steering purpose. Imaginatively, it
is like trying to steer a river by means of toothpicks! Even if we considered in (1.4) the absolutely
continuous part fla =f of v only with respect to 1, if there was any, we would end up with an
equation of the type
