The value of the passing current will then be

0="87 farad per 8econd. It is also evident that, knowing the value of K, we may determine the horizontal
intensity of the earth's magnetism, H, in any place quickly and simply by means of an
ordinary sine or tangent galvanometer. Thus by transposing the equation (3) we have for the tangent galvanometer

FE 27Tn
ES = 4+»

In fact the standard of electric potential is second only in importance to that of the
8tandard of electric resistance; and the use of such a standard, combined with an auxiliary
battery in the manner described in the foregoing paper, admits of a variety of applications
which it is believed will be found of great value in electrical research. In conelusion I have to acknowledge the great assistance I have received from Mr. HerBerT TayLos, C.K., and Dr.
