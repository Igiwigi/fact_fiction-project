One is
called the rolling shutter and the other called global shutter. Although both technologies record
ight within a necessary time interval, not every portion of the image starts and stops receiving
ight at the same time. As used in popular complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
cameras, a rolling shutter is exposed in a progressive step, in fact line by line from top to bottom. Figure 7 illustrates details of the rolling shutter process in successive image recording. As can
be seen from this figure, the start and end of exposure on each row or column or individual pixel
happen sequentially.
