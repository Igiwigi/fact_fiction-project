2 This formula would clearly not show, in a narrow range such as that between 400
Hand 1000 sea miles, very much divergence from those given by RypozyXsx1(") and
 Zenneck (!*); and both these writers claim that their formule represent the results
8 of Austin’s experiments better than his own, On the other hand, it would show even
Bin this range a well-marked divergence from Macponaup’s formula, though not
sbperhaps sufficient to be conclusive. When the comparison is extended to the wider
‘& range covered by Hocan’s experiments, the divergence would appear to be decisive.
S If the records of the observations could be accepted without criticism, it could be
Sstated that the law of decrease of amplitude of the electro-magnetic waves with
‘3 increasing distance from the sending station, as expressed by the formula (59), has
% been tested and found adequate over a wide range of distances and waye-lengths ;
eand further, since this formula cannot be reconciled even approximately with

account for the observed facts.

22. I hesitate to draw this inference for two reasons. First, there is some doubt as

& to what the observed facts really are. Second, a different interpretation of the

B available records leads to precisely the opposite conclusion.

S$ As regards the observations, I wish to make it clear at the outset that I do not
