The difference O' N=0' M=:07=log 1175 gives the ratio in which the differences
of pressure are affected by a difference in temperature. This, according to the law
that the results are proportional to the square roots of the differences of temperature,
would be equivalent to a difference of 21* in the temperature of the water. This
difference did not exist, hence there must have been a difference, owing to the greater
thickness or to the different nature of the meerschaum plate.

The 8ize of the woodeut does nob admit the points indicating the actual experiments
being shown, but these are shown in the larger figures, Plates 48 and 49.

Stucco plate No. 2.

29. These facts will be better understood after examining the experiments on a 8econd
stucco plate. The trial of this plate was owing to an accident to the diffusiometer
containing stucco plate No. 1. The diffusiometer was thereupon refitted with another
plate similar to No. 1; but the old tin plates were replaced by new bright ones, and
the new india-rubber rings were somewhat thicker than the old ones.
