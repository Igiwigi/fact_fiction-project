It is neither more nor less than the gradual evacuation
of our cognitive faculties from our conscious field and even our physical body. To put it briefly,
the emigration of information processing from page to screen (from first television, then personal
computer and now smartphone) has provoked over the last several decades the externalization of
most of our cognitive abilities, beginning with the delegation of our memory function to recording
devices. Since the advent of Internet and digital technologies, our memory is slipping away from
us. [explains the late philosopher Bernard Stiegler] We are increasingly entrusting items
that we formerly held in our memories (telephone numbers, addresses, spelling rules and
mental calculations, for instance) to machines at our fingertips. [11]

From now on, in order to remember facts, we delegate them to machines, like our photographs,
the ‘memory’ of which we trust to our smartphones. To verify the loss of internal memory, all
that is needed is to find a minute to run through the photographs stored in one’s smartphone. The level of surprise that one experiences at seeing them anew is a measure of what escaped from
one’s recollections only to be recovered in that phone, that, of course, we will lose or have stolen
one day or another.
