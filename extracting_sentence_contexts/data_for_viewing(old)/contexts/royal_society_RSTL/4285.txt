Five inner zones; whilst in that represented in Plate V. fig. 7, the canal is single for
the first twenty-three zones, Whenever the annular canal is single, the upper and
lower superficial cells also become continuous, and form a series of columnar cells in
every respect similar to those of the simpler type (compare Plate V. fig. 5 with the
portion @—b of Plate V. fig. 7). If, then, the growth of either of these disks had been
checked within the first zone in which its annular canal becomes double, it would
have been accounted as belonging to the simpler type; and the wide variation which
here shows itself, in regard to the distance from the nucleus at which the more com-

plex type begins to be assuned, sufficiently explains the fact already noticed (© 22.)
that although the disks of the © simple” type are for the most part of minute Size, yet
that the diameter of many of them exceeds that of the smaller disks of the complex

58. Even when an intermediate stratum is formed by the separation of the annular
canals, the superficial cells are not always clearly marked-off from its columnar
cavities; for instead of being separated by floors formed by the expanded summits
of the zonal septa (© 28.), they sometimes open at once into the columnar cells of
the intermediate substance, 80 as to be quite continuous with them. Of this we
have an example in the three zones 6—8 of the specimen represented in Plate V.
fig. 10, b—c. This continuity of the superficial cells with the intermeCiate columns,
is sometimes maintained throughout the disk, 80 that in no part of it are the former
