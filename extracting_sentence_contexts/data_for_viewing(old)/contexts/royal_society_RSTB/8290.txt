Jac = Me (7 _ ‘) ; (2.3) synthesizing unit (SU; Kooijman 1998) with two

L sequential behavioural modes: searching and handling

(including digestion and other metabolic work). Many
extensions of this idea have been proposed. The orig-
inal formulation of the behaviour SUs is stochastic
but the standard DEB model only uses the mean
feeding rate.

_ The maximum surface-specific assimilation rate
{Jzm} is assumed to be constant, which is explained
by the fact that digestion and other food processing
activities depend on mass transport processes that
occur through surfaces.

At constant food density, the reserve density evolves
to mi =f ({Jzam}/[Mv]®) = fen (equation 2.5),
which is independent of size and proportional to the
scaled functional response. The scaled reserve density
e€= mz /mg,, equals the scaled functional response f in
equilibrium.

where specific growth rate + = (1/V)dV/dt and struc-
tural length L can vary (equation 2.10), but energy
