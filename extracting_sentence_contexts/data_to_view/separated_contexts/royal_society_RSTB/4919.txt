The form of
the pollen sacs was somewhat similar, but we know little of the structure of the
microsporangia in either case. It seems probable that whereas Crossotheca synangia
had two loculi, those of Caylonia probably had four. So far as the available facts go, it is not impossible to regard the Caytoniales as
forms derived from a Pteridosperm complex, by the development of the closed, protecting,
carpel wall, either from a cupule-like structure of the type seen in Gnetopsis, or in a
manner to which the known Pteridosperms furnish no clue. (b) Bennettitalesâ€”The possibility of a phyletic relationship between the Bennettitales
and the Angiosperms has been so widely discussed that it is desirable to ascertain
