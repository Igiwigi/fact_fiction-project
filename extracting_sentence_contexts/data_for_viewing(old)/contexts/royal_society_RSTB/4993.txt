We have referred above to the similarity in seed structure between Caytonia and
the Gnetales, Bennettitales and the Pteridosperms. We should here notice that the
structure of the testa of Gristhorpia was much simpler, and was lacking in fibrous
elements. It seems possible that in both my genera there were two integuments, and
we have here a point of comparison with the Angiosperm seed. It may further be
noticed that many Angiosperm seeds give a similar appearance to that shown by
Caytonia and Gristhorpia when macerated in Scuutrzâ€™s solution. The megaspore
membrane remains as the most distinct feature, while the outer integument may be
lightly cutinised and this may extend to the micropyle.

But the main points of comparison of the Caytoniales with the Angiosperms must be :
first the shape of the stamens with their four angles, four loculi and longitudinal
dehiscence along the groove between the ridges; secondly, the fact that the ovules
were borne inside closed carpels with a distinct and physiologically specialised
stigma, that there were many orthotropous ovules, sometimes arranged in two
