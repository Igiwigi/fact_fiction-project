same ratios (difference of pressure to mean pressure) as those in the table, the numbers
in the ratio columns of Tables VI, and VII. were plotted, the mean pressures being
taken as abscisse. The points were joined 80 as to form curves, and then finding
points on the curve whose ordinates corresponded to a particular number in the first
column, the abscisse gave the numbers required for the third column in Tables X.
and XI. In this way the numbers in the third column are rather more uniform than
they would have been had they been the results of actual observation.

Tables X. and XI. show that within the limits of accuracy of the experiments the
pressures in the stucco correspond with pressures in the meerschaum six times as
great. This is exactly according to Law V., Art. 7, from which it appears that the
numerical relation between the corresponding pressures is the relation between the
diameters of the interstices of the meerschaum and stucco plates. This fact also is
confirmed, for not only does it appear that the ratio is independent of the mean
density of the gas, but it is the same for hydrogen as it is for air, showing that the
relation depends only on the nature of the plates,

28. It appeared, however, that as a method of obtaining the corresponding pressures
the comparison of the ratios was not entirely satisfactory, for it involved the assump-
tion that the ratio of corresponding differences of pressure should be exactly the same
