represents an approximation, valid for sufficiently small deformations. It has been shown
by Mooney (1940) that this form for W is the most general one which can be valid, even for
large deformations, for an ideal incompressible highly elastic material, isotropic in its
undeformed state, if the relation between the shearing force and amount of simple shear is
linear, when the material is subjected to a simple shear superposed on a constant simple
extension. The form (1:3) for the stored-energy function will accordingly be referred to as
the Mooney form.

It is the object of the present paper to show how the theory of large elastic deformations
can be used to explain the load-deformation characteristics of vulcanized rubber for certain
simple types of deformation in terms of a single form of stored-energy function. This task is
made more difficult than it otherwise would be by the fact that some of the test-pieces used
have to be moulded individually, and it is difficult to make two rubber specimens having
identical properties even if nominally identical procedures are followed in preparing
them.

In the first series of experiments (§§2 to 4) the forces necessary to produce various pure
homogeneous deformations, for which either J, or J, have specified values, in a sheet of rubber
are measured. From these measurements the values of dW/0J, and dW/0J, are found for
various values of J, and J,, Unfortunately, the formulae which have to be employed, in order
to calculate dW/dJ, and dW /dJ, from the measurements, greatly emphasize the experimental
errors, and the values of dW/dI, and dW/dI, cannot be very accurately determined. It
appears, however, that for the particular rubber employed, dW/0J, is substantially inde-
pendent of /, and J,, while 0W/0I, is independent of J, and falls with increase of J, from a value
