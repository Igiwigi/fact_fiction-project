The abundance of phenotypes is not homogeneous in sequence space [8,13-
16], since most sequences are mapped into a small fraction of very large phenotypes. This
fraction, however, suffices to guarantee a spectrum of different and efficient enough functions
so as to sustain life as we know it. The high dimensionality of genotype spaces and the fact
that the networks of abundant phenotypes percolate the space of sequences under very general
conditions [17] further ensures that different functions may be awaiting just a few mutations
apart [18,19]. The genotype-to-function map is redundant in several different ways beyond neutral and
quasi-neutral mutations. The many layers of expression from genotype to function [20] act
towards increasing the ensemble of possible genotypes coding for comparable phenotypes [21,22].
