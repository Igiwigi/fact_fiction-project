This is indeed an
open problem of large data long time existence associated with the Einstein flow and closely
related to the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. But if the Lyapunov functional ever did achieve its
infimum then the infimum would correspond to the background solution that is characterized by
the hyperbolic manifold as its spatial component. On the other hand, using the currently available
techniques, we can only establish a Lyapunov stability, which does not prove (or disprove) the
fact that these background solutions are asymptotically stable. These open issues require careful
investigation and should be addressed in future studies. Data accessibility.
