It will be seen that this curve (F., fig. 33) very
nearly coincides with our persistency curve, except in the part of the spectrum affected
by the yellow spot. No measures were taken to ascertain if the eye of M. had any central absorption,
and, therefore, we do not know what correction should be made to the curve to make
it comparable with the others; but taken as it is, it is remarkable how closely this,
which represents the deficiency in M.’s sensations, corresponds with the one sensation
of either of the brothers. In fact, it seems as if the eyes of M. and P. together
would make up a pair of normal eyes. ON COLOUR PHOTOMETRY. 551
