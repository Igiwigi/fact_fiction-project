to asmme alterations in the density and height of the atmosphere, to account for
different amounts of heat being preserved to the earth at different times; a slight
change in its variable constituents would suffice for this. Such changes in fact may
have produced all the mutations of climate which the researches of geologists reveal. However this may be, the facts above cited remain ; they constitute true causes, the
extent alone of the operation remaining doubtful. The measurements recorded in the foregoing pages constitute only a fraction of those
actually made; but they fulfil the object of the present portion of the inquiry.
