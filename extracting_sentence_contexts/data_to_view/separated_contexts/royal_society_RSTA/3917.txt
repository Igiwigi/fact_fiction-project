The continuum model accounts for reactions through
a boundary condition on the outer edge of the boundary layer and further assumes the fluid
flow field satisfies stick boundary conditions on the surface of the particle. Neither of these
conditions is fully valid when one examines the particle dynamics within the boundary layer
in the microscopic simulations of our small motors. This breakdown of the continuum model is
also reflected in the fact that the continuum and simulation values of the motor velocity differ. The microscopic model accounts for both of these effects through the direct hard intermolecular
interactions between the fluid particles and the Janus motor. Figure 2b presents quantitative
comparisons of B particle concentrations and concentration gradients near the boundary layer
(rR) as a function of 6.
