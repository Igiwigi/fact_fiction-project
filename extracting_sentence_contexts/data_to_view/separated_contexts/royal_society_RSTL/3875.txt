Hence the nature of the thermo-electric effect in each of the three
cases falls under the designation © current from hard to soft through hot,” by which
Macnvus tated his resalt as regards iron. This is just as is to be expected from the
crystalline theory; since longitudinal extension has a common characteristic with
lateral condensation in the theory of strains, and only differs from condensation
uniform in all transverse directions, by a certain degree of absolute dilatation which
accompanies it, instead of the slight absolute condensation accompanying the lateral
condensation as an effect of pressure all round the sides. In fact the agreement
between the characters of the thermo-electric effects due to longitudinal traction
and lateral pressure, and again between the reverse characters of the effects of per-
manent longitudinal extension and those of permanent lateral compression established
by the experiments which have been described, proves that these effects are due to
distorting stress, and to permanent distortion, in the main, and leaves it quite an
open question, only to be decided by further experimental investigation, what may
be the effects of uniform pressure and of permanent uniform condensations or dila-
tations,

123. The crystalline theory is really unavoidable when it is thus established that
the effect discovered is due to distortion ; but till, as the-one designation © current
from hard to soft through hot” applies to all the cases of permanent strain in iron as
yet experimented on, I thought it necessary, for removing the possibility of objec-
tions, that an iron conductor giving a current from soft to hard through hot, should
be constructed. T therefore took twenty-four small oft iron bars turned in a lathe
