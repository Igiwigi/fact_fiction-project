Dr. WeLLs was led to his new theory by a fact which he acci-
dentally observed, and which he could not reconcile with any existing theory of
visible direction ; this fact had, though he was unaware of it, been previously noticed
by Dr. Sura ; it is already mentioned in \ 8., and is the only instance of binocular
vision of relief which I have found recorded previous to my own investigations. $0
little does Dr. WELLs's theory appear to have been understood, that no subsequent
writer has attempted either to confirm or disprove his opinions. It would be useless
here to discuss the principles of this theory, which was framed to account for an ano-
malous individual fact, since it is inconsistent with the general rules on which that
fact has been now shown to depend. Notwithstanding these erroneous views, the
* es8ay upon single vision with two eyes‚Äù contains many valuable experiments and
remarks, the truth of which are independent of the theory they were intended to
illustrate. MR.
