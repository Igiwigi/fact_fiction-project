We have already seen that KtHNE considered the
opacity produced in muscle exposed for a time to a temperature of 45° or 46° C. to
be due to the production of a heat-coagulum, so that, at any rate for the second
contraction, we are forced to the conclusion that the cause is the formation of a
heat-coagulum. Another fact which is against the rigor-mortis view lies in the
marked difference in time required to bring about complete heat-contraction when
the muscle is exposed to the two temperatures of 34°°5 C. and 38° C. This difference
in time is immediately explicable by the known influence of these two temperatures
~ upon solutions of soluble myogen-fibrin ; whereas, if rigor-mortis were the process at
3 work, it would simply stand out as a curious fact without any immediate and simple
5 explanation. 'e There is a further difference of great significance which is, that where a muscle
Bis passing into rigor-mortis there is a previous loss of excitability before any con-
2 traction occurs, whereas, in the case of heat-contraction, excitability may persist for
{some time after a marked contraction has been produced. Loss of excitability from
heat appears to progress synchronously with the increase of opacity, which
5 accompanies heat-contraction.
