Are these electric cups degenerated discs, or are they the primitive
ancestral elements out of which the discs have been evolved? Do these characteristic
cups ever develop into discs, or do they, after having persisted for a time, finally
disappear, or are they distinct and independent structures ? These and various other questions at once suggest themselves for solution, but in
the meantime I need only say that I believe the large discs of the common Skate
have been derived from cup-shaped structures, such as still persist in certain adult
forms—that, in fact, the electric plate of the disc in Raia batis is the greatly
expanded lining of a simple cup-shaped structure, such as exists in Raia radiata,
while the accessory portions of the disc have been derived from the muscular substance

composing the body of the cup, ;
To make the account of the development intelligible it will be desirable to shortly



PROFESSOR J. C. EWART ON THE ELECTRIC ORGAN OF THE SKATE. 401

describe the structure of the hitherto imperfectly described organ of the Gray Skate. While in the Torpedo the electric elements are arranged to form numerous vertical
columns, in the Skate they give rise to numerous hollow cones, which are fitted
within each other to form two elongated electric spindles, one at.
