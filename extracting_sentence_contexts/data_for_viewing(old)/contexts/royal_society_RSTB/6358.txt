of the egg into the isthmus and its transference into the uterus proper. The absence
of a macroscopical boundary indicating this special junctional region adds to the
difficulty in selecting material. From the observations of previous workers, there is
little doubt that the glands of the isthmo-uterine junction, apart from those which
are obviously isthmal in type, are characterized by lesser numbers of secretory
granules, which stain similarly to those in the isthmal glands, though they are not
usually so large.

Braviey (1928) has suggested, with some hesitation, that the tubular glands of
this region are mixed, in that they contain a proportion of isthmal and uterine
epithelial cells in any individual gland. I have observed what might be this
condition so rarely that it is impossible to accept this interpretation as conclusive.
In fact glands having this mixed condition (B, fig. 4, in BRaDLEy’s paper) are quite
atypical of the region. Instead, groups of glands which are typically isthmal, some
which are entirely uterine, and a third or special type, é, fig. 20, Plate 17, characterized
by the presence of a limited number of dark granules in all the cells of a transverse
section, more accurately represent the condition at the isthmo-uterine junction.

The secretion filling the lumina of the special junctional glands has been referred
to as staining with difficulty, but it has not been observed in its passage from the
glands to the oviducal lumen. No conclusive interpretation of the function of the
special glands can be made, though it should be noted that they remain longest
in close relation to the shell membrane at the blunt end of the egg. A separation of
