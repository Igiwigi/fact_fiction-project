analytical and geometrical Methods of Investigation. 117

by equations, and the order of classing them, considered as
generated by description, Moreover, he animadverts on the
custom of confounding the two sciences of algebra and geo-
metry;* and, if any authority is attached to his assertion, that
\the two sciences ought not to. be confounded together, the
separation of geometry‚Äù from algebra will thereby be equally
urged as the separation of algebra from geometry. And it can-
not be said with greater truth, that the simplicity of geometry
is vitiated with algebraic equations, than that the simplicity of
analysis is vitiated with geometrical forms and expressions. In
fact, each science ought to be kept distinct; and be made to
derive its riches from its proper sources.

XXV. It will not demand much meditation to be assured of
this truth, that, in any mathematical investigation, the geome-
trical method, properly so called, is not essentially or absolutely
necessary. The properties of extension and figure, to which this
method has been especially appropriated, may be analytically
treated; and here it is proper to state a distinction neces-
sary to be made, between what 'may be called analytical geo-
metry, and the application of analysis to geometry. The first
does not suppose or require the existence of such a method as
the geometrical; but, from a few fundamental principles, analy-
