Hs and lichen of the kind above mentioned that I have examined, I have invariably
nd that the free Nematoids present were representatives of my two genera Plectus
& Aphelonchus. It seems therefore highly probable that the so-called «© Anguillule”
Fpreceeding observers were also representatives of these genera. The specimens met
gh were of yery different ages, many containing well-deyeloped ova within them, and
E property of reviviscence seems common to old and young alike. Possibly there
uy be a slight difference in the degree of tenacity of life enjoyed by the immature and
1Badult animals respectively, but, at all events, no notable difference exists, such as we
abs ascertained to be the case with Tylenchus tritici. After what has already been said,
ould be useless for me to give further details concerning the powers of resisting the
facts of prolonged and complete desiccation possessed by these animals whilst still in
1eir natural habitat, whether this be sand, moss, or lichen, but I can add a few inter-
sting facts concerning the extreme curtailment of this power when the animal is
Bowed to undergo the process of desiccation on a slip of glass, isolated from all other
materials and thus freely exposed to the air; and also concerning the reults of other
Fperiments, made with free Nematoids not belonging to one of the four genera before
inmed.

In swbmitting the animals to these tests, I was careful to select active uninjured
