recent extensive exchange of personal communications involving a few of our colleagues and
related to a new experiment announced by Aerts & Sozzo [6].

The issue in question is by no means new: it was in fact raised and discussed in [7], using
as an example an experiment by Aerts et al. [8]. Later, this issue has become a central one
in the development of our approach to contextuality, called contextuality-by-default (CbD)
[1-5,9-12]. It has become clear from the discussion in question, however, that there are still
serious disagreements about this issue. The aim of this paper is to offer a resolution for these
disagreements and to dispel possible conceptual confusions.

Although prompted by a discussion of [6], this paper is not meant to be a critique of that or
any particular paper. We use the experiment presented in [6] and the paradigm in which it was
conducted only as an example, one providing an opportunity to demonstrate the workings of our
theory of contextuality and to make our points. We would like therefore to play down the critical
aspects of this paper.
