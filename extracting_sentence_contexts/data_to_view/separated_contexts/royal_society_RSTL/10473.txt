From the above results it was calculated that the decrease of resis-
tance per unit produced by an increase of fluid-pressure of 1 grm. per square centimetre
would be 27854 x 10-Y,

On showing these results, however, to Professor G. G. STokes, he suggested that
sufficient account had not been taken of the fact that the alteration of pressure might
affect the resistance by altering the melting-point temperature of the ice, though, as
I thought, the ice would not be sufficiently wet in the inner cylinder, as the tempera-
ture of the room at the time was frequently almost at 0* C., and the cylinder well
gurrounded by ice on the outside to affect the resulb in this way. Nevertheless,
acting on this 8uggestion, I carefully determined the increase of resistance at 0* C.
@ for a rise of 1* C., in the manner adopted by MATTHIESSEN, and found this to be
0038587 per unit of resistance. Now, J.
