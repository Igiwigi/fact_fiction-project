I cannot refrain from stating that, in my opinion, the five-lobed character of the upper
molars is of a too general value to be used for generic distinction. In fact all the
Eocene and Miocene Paridigitate genera (with crescentic teeth) have five-lobed upper
molars, and therefore this character is as unfit for generic distinction, in this large
asxemblage of animals, as the fact of having four-lobed molars would be found unfit if
we tried to apply it to the living Ruminantia; it is of too general a nature, all living
Ruminantia having four-lobed upper molars.

In such cases where the true molars present too great a uniformity for furnishing
good distinctive characters, the shape of the premolars may be of great use, as was well
shown by Professors RimiMerER and HrNsRL, in reference to Suina and Ruminantia.
And, in fact, if we compare the premolars of the Eocene Hyopotamideae figured by Prover
and HuMBerr, {Zlyopotamus Gresslyi, H. Renevieri, and even his Z. erispus (1. c. plate
xxiv. fig. 11), we shall see that all these Eocene ZÅ¿yopotamideae, though of such different
8ize, agree together in the shape of their premolars, while they differ by the same cha-
racter from the true Miocene Zlyopotamide from Hempstead and Puy. As I hope 800n
to collect materials for a description not only of the dentition but even of the skeleton
of these Eocene species, T will not enter further into this matter here, and I will only
sate that, by comparing the figures of Prcrevr with my plates, the reader will perceive
that the premolars of all the Eocene ZHyopotamidwa are, s0 to say, more ruminant-like:
this is especially the case with premolars p? and p*; they are considerably more clongated
and not 80 high as in the Zyopotamus and Anthracotherium. Besides, I suspect from
some bones seen in the collection in Lansanne, and especially from a metatarsal of
Hyopotamus (Cainotherium) Renevieri figured by Picrer (1. e. plate xxvii. fig. 2), that
