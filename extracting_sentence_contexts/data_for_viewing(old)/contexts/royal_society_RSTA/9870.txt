of helium in the gas, and falling to 3, as Scawarze showed, when either gas was
eliminated. This fact is interesting, but, in the absence of any explanatory theory,
does not lead to anything further.

Wacnsmvuts also found that the observations could be represented to within 2 per
cent. or 3 per cent. by the formula

x +
ty = 1+Ap’/p ie Bp/p’

(modelled on a similar formula for the viscosity of gases which we shall consider
presently). As there were only four observations and two empirical constants the
fact is not very remarkable; when p = 0 of course 3,, = 9’, and when p’ = 0 we have
3. =. A much better agreement was obtained by allowing the empirical constants
A and B (obtained by the method of least squares) to be imaginary. In this case the
expression reduces to the quotient of a cubic by a quartic homogeneous expression in
the variables p, p’; as WacusmutH remarks, the relation is good as an interpolation
formula, but that is all.

We proceed to determine the value of 5, from our formula. Taking oxygen as
the standard gas (for which p, = 0°001429 at 0° C. and normal pressure) we have w
(for argon) equal to 1°224, and w’ = 0°125. The values of my (ie, ~ at 0° C.)
determined by Scxunrze (loc. cit. on p. 463), viz., 0°0002104 and 0°0001891 respec-
tively, will be used; also the previously given values of ©,. The coefficient of
diffusion D,, for argon and helium has been determined by Scummt and Lonrus
