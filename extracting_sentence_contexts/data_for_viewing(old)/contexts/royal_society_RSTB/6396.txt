factors as wind, temperature, cloud, and humidity, which change rapidly from day
to day, and also to the phase of the moon which is not eliminated by taking the mean
over the same period as the length of the lunar months.

With the information we have gained above, however, it is now possible to
correct this 29-day mean for the expected lunar influence based primarily on the
curves shown in figs. 4 and 6 and the information in Table IV.

The factors that have to be considered are

(1) the mean + and â€” departures at no moon and full moon ;

(2) the fact that the differences are at their minimum in June and maximum in
October ;

(3) the alteration in asymmetry of the corrections from the months before mid- -
June to those after.

With these facts as a basis, there has finally been added to fig. 7 a third curve
(dotted) showing the 29-day mean corrected as nearly as possible for the lunar
influence.

It will immediately be seen how much more closely the curve fits the changes in
the log histogram, than did the 29-day mean ; thereby showing what a high pro-
portion of the variation is due to the lunar influence.
