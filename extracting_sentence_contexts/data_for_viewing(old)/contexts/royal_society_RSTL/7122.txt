PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL AGENTS UPON BLOOD. 689

In relating the experiments, I have sedulously avoided advancing any theories with
regard to the mode of action of any of the agents studied, and on one or two occasions
only has eyen as much as a hint been given that the results obtained might in any way
tend to the elucidation of the action of remedies or the mode of death by poison. 'The
reticence in this instance has arisen from the circumstance that several of the results are
80 novel and at the same time 80 pregnant with material for theorizing, that the indi-
vidual facts might s0on be lost sight of in a sea of speculation. It appears to me there-
fore that the ends of science will be much better served if I confine myself to a descrip-
tion of the bare data, rather than propound the numerous theories which the different
results 8uggest, and which, although they might make the paper more interesting, could
not in reality add to its true value.

I may als mention that the material is s0 arranged as to be easily accessible, each
fact having been made as far as possible independent of its associates, in order that
future inquirers may find no difficulty in isolating any particular result they may desire
specially to investigate. Moreover, the progressive details of each experiment are given
in the form of an appendix, s0 that the initiated investigator can follow it with facility
through its different stages, either for the purposes of comparison or verification *,
