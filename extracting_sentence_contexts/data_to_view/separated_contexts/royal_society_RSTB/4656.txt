In Osteorhachis the neural arches alternate with the pleurocentra, and are
separate from them. While it is possible, even probable, that there are a pair of
interdorsal elements entering into the composition of each pleurocentrum, these
elements do not necessarily constitute more than a small portion of it. The fact that
the pleurocentrum is not in two parts, right and left, shows that it is not in a
primitive condition. If it is composed of interdorsalia only, one would expect to
find it a paired structure; if it consists of two interdorsals and a semicircular
structure developed from a half-ring of skeletogenous tissue independently of them,
the primitive condition would exhibit the triple origin; if, on the other hand, it
consists of the half-ring only, then the argument as to its origin from arch-cartilage
falls through. As regards the hypocentrum, although the projections that carry the
ribs are almost without a doubt basiventral elements, if does not follow that the

hypocentrum is solely a product of the basiventrals.
