nature, in which Phallusia eggs in the two-cell stage were allowed to develop in sea-
water of py 5°0, produced by the addition of HCl and subsequent aeration to bring
the CO, tension again into equilibrium with the atmosphere, for about one hour and
then returned to normal water again, That is, the developing eggs were subjected to
relatively high acidity during just that period in which the primary 8 or 16 chordal
cells became delimited, and the result of this treatment was that tadpoles were formed
apparently normal except that their tails were but half the normal full length, and were
relatively wide. In fact, they had exactly the appearance of normal tails that were
half grown, and in which there were still two parallel columns of chordal cells. The
sense organs in these larvae were apparently normal and fully differentiated. Therefore,
not only does an increase in alkalinity produce an increase in the degree of imbibition
but a decrease causes a corresponding reduction.

Cutip has made certain observations and experiments recently (1927) on the develop-
ment of Corella willmeriana of very great interest in connection with anural develop-
ment. This paper has already in part been discussed (BERRILL, 1929) in connection
with the onset of metamorphosis. Corella willmeriana is viviparous and the embryos
are liberated from the parent as fully formed tadpoles. However, if the eggs are
extracted from the parent and caused to develop in ordinary sea-water, all degrees
of differential inhibition of development occur, and this was found to be due to the
