retained for values of E greater than about a?. On the other hand, for negative values
of E there is an extended tailing. The diagram also shows that in estimating the end
of the band by an extrapolation of the linear part of the curve (shown dotted in the

diagram), an error of about 2a is made. In the case of Mg, a fitting of the experi-
mental tailing curve already given in figure 9 gives a value of a? of the order of } eV.
However, this method cannot give a? accurately because, for large negative values
of E, the theoretical curve is rather sensitive to the limit Z,,, and, owing to the fact that
a really decreases with increasing £, it is hard to estimate what value of E,, one should
take in equation (11) to obtain the best approximation. A comparison with the actual
curves for positive values of £, using a rather naive extrapolation of that part which
seems to conform to the E! law, probably gives better values. These are tabulated in
table 7. Though only rough, they appear to show a definite increase in a? with
increasing band width, as might be expected.
