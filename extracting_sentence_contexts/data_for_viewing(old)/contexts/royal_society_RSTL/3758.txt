2 MR. AIRY ON THE LAWS OF THE RISE AND

high and low water, for the purpose of ascertaining the durations of the rise and fall
of the tide. With this view, the depression of the water below the wharf was ob-
served at the four quarters-of-hour nearest to the time of high water, and af. the
seven quarters-of-hour nearest to the time of low water (a greater number of obser-
vations being made near low water, because less is known, from other observations,
of the time of low water). And I proposed, by combining the observations of each
group, to find the times of high water and of low water much more accurately than
by the rude observation of the highest or the lowest water. But in discussing the
low-water observations, I found an unexpected difficulty, The rise of the water at a
given interval after low water (in half an hour, for instance) is considerably more
rapid than its descent at the same interval before low water. There is in fact the ru-
diment of a veritable hore. It is impossible here to use any observations for deter-
mining the time of low water except those which are very near to the low water.

My curiosity was now excited to learn with a little more precision the laws of the
rise and fall of the water generally. For this parpose, Captain Swrreee undertook,
at my request, to arrange for the observation of the depression of the water at every
quarter-of-an-hour, night and day, during half a lunation. This was done, 80 far as
I can judge, with the most perfect regularity. The observations commenced at Fe-
bruary 16, 12" 15”, astronomical time, and finished at March 4, 12% 0», The whole
number of observations is 1536.

In the computation of these observations it is to be considered that the times of
