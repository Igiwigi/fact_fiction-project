MaNnwarine and Kusana (19), again, in experiments on
the reaction of the perfused lungs of the anaphylactic guinea-pig, found that
addition of serum from an immunised animal to the perfusion fluid protected against
the action of the antigen. Such experiments appear to be clearly in favour of the theory which regards the
antibody as sensitistng when predominantly located in the cells, and as protective
when it is in excess in the blood. The anaphylatoxin theory provides no explanation
for such facts, but its persistence seems to show that they have not been accepted as
decisive. It seemed desirable, therefore, to devise an experiment in which the
conditions had a diagrammatic simplicity, so that the effects on sensitiveness of
cellular and humoral antibody could be isolated from other possible factors,

The antigen chosen was pure, crystallised albumin from the henâ€™s egg. The
antibody was obtained by immunising rabbits with a series of injections.
