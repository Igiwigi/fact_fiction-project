is the Clarke derivative of dx(-) at x in the direction of u (e.g. [15] or [11, Proposition 7.3.10] for
details). Hence, the map K x E 5 (x,u) +> dg(x,u) is upper semicontinuous (as a real function) and
for x € K, dy(x, -) is convex. If K is closed convex, then (see [12, Section 4.2])

is the tangent cone in the sense of convex analysis. Some other facts and details are to be found
in [12, Section 4.1] or [11, Section 4.1]. Let us only mention that if K = D(xo,R) and ||x — xo|| =R,


then u € Tx(x) if and only if [x — xo, u]+ <0, where the semi-inner product (e.g. [16, Section 1.6]),

Observe that if E is a Hilbert space, then ||x||[x, y]+ = (x, y) is the inner product.
