The other person, THomas STRETTON, is a young
man of s0briety and steadiness, and long sighted also. I par-
ticularly mention these circumstances, to obviate an objection
that has been made to these accounts, from the cireumstance
of the bright star in the south eye of the bull, called Aldebaran,
having passed by the moon the same evening, and been
eclipsed by the northern part of her disk. I own it is a singu-
lar coincidence of circumstances, that Aldebaran should the
same evening pass behind the moon, in nearly the same track
in which this star-like appearance was observed upon the dark
part of the moon's disc : but the two facts, considered as inde-
pendent of each other, are not incompatible. The appulse of
Aldebaran to, and subsequent occultation by the moon's disc,
was predicted in the nautical almanac, and observed by many.


of a Light seen in the dark Part of the Moon. 439

I observed its eclipse at the moon's dark limb at 6* 4,7! go”,
and its emersion from the moon's bright limb, at 7* go* g”
mean time, at Greenwich.*

The appearance of the spot of light upon the moon's dark
part, and its subsequent sudden disappearance at Norwich,
happened near eight o'clock ; and the observation of the star
upon the moon at St. John's Square happened about the same
time, I would then ask the persons who make the objection,
how could two persons, at two distant places, see a star appear
upon the dark part of the moon, at a considerable distance
within its circumference, while it was really off it, especially as
they were both long sighted ? and particularly, how could the
immersion be observed near eight o'clock, which really hap-
pened at 54, minutes past six, or above an hour before?
