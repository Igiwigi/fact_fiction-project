Hence we have for the heat evolved during the precipitation of
1 grm. lead by zine . . . . . 182 or 327?
1 equiy. lead by zine. . . . . 2357? or 42487.

Salts of Mercury with Zinc.

Chloride of Mercury and Zinc.â€”This is the only salt of mercury which was
examined. The result however is sufficient to determine the thermal position of
mercury among the metals. 100 grms. of a solution containing 1'240 grm. chloride
of mercury were taken. The thermal value of the whole was 106:4 grms. water.
In this case no further development of heat occurred after the precipitation was com-
pleted, nor was there any disengagement of hydrogen gas. The excess of zinc, in
fact, became amalgamated, which effectually prevented both oxidation and voltaic
action.
