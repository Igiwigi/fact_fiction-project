In fact, the 4/5-law (1.9) fixes the scaling exponent p/3 in (1.6) via the statistical assumption
of monofractal scaling in Kolmogorov’s theory. On its face, this indicates that the turbulent fluid
velocity satisfies 5;u ~ 1/5 and so is ‘1/3 differentiable’, at least in some averaged sense. More
precisely, the fact that ¢ is a priori bounded by initial data and forcing via equation (1.3) ensures
that si ()/€ is controlled uniformly for small ¢. This suggests that some kind of a priori regularity
information—a ‘turbulent energy estimate’—might be extracted from the 4/5-law. Unfortunately,
aside from justifying the assumptions necessary for a rigorous derivation of (1.9), there are
two obstructions to realizing this hope: (i) the longitudinal structure function does not measure
velocity variations in all directions, only those aligned with the separation vector and (ii) the
integrand is not sign-definite.
