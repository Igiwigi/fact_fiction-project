This disturbance has no material effect upon the performance of the machine. But
the current in the armature also distorts the arrangement of the comparatively weak
field in the gap between the pole-pieces, displacing the point of zero field in the
direction of rotation in a generator and opposite to. the direction. of rotation in. a
motor ; and it, is, due to this that the non-sparking point for the brushes is displaced.,
A satisfactory mathematical analysis of the: displacement of the field in the gap
between the pole-pieces by the: current in the armature would be more troublesome
than an @ priort analysis of the distribution of field in this space when the magnet
current is the only magnetising force. Owing to the fact that the armature is divided
into a finite number of sections there is a rapid diminution of the displacement of the
field during the time that a section is being commutated, the diminution. being

recovered whilst the brush is in contact with only one bar of the commutator. The-
field thus oscillates slightly, owing to the disturbance caused by reversing the
direction of the current in the 8uccessive sections of the armature. The number of
oscillations in a GRAMME armature or in a SIEMENS' armature with an even number of
8ections. will be pm, where p is the number of revolutions per second, but in a
Stemexs' armature with an odd number of sections it will be 2pm.* This oscillation
