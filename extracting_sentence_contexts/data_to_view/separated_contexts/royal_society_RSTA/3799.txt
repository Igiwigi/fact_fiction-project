In a similar spirit, it is natural to distinguish eigenmodes of the helicity operator H with 1S
opposite eigenvalues, which may be thought of as representing photons with opposite spin in Dos
the propagation direction. For a mode Ax with eigenvalue +1, we find for the densities (2.9) and : Sg
(2.10) the particularly simple form

Note that, for helicity eigenmodes, the densities of energy and helicity are determined by the local
strength of the mode function. The densities of momentum and AM are proportional to the cross
product (2.5), which determines the local polarization, and has the nature of the spin density.
