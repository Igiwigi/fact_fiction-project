The contact theory has
long had possession of men's minds, is sustained by a great weight of authority, and
for years had almost undisputed sway in some parts of Europe. If it be an error, it
can only be rooted out by a great amount of forcible experimental evidence; a fact
sufficiently clear to my mind by the circumstance, that Dz 1a Rive's papers have not
already convinced the workers upon this subject. Hence the reason why I have
thought it needful to add my further testimony to his and that of others, entering
into detail and multiplying facts in a proportion far beyond any which would have
been required for the proof and promulgation of a new scientific truth (2017.). In
s0 doing, I may occasionally be only enlarging, yet then I hope strengthening, what
others, and especially Dx La Riv, have done. 1800.
