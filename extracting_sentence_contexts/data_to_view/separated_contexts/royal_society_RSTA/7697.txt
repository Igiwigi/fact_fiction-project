It appears that the cross-section twists so that the right-angle edge of the cylinder
is bent away from the flexing force, and although the anticlastic displacements tend
somewhat to mask the visible effect of the twisting made evident by the relative dis-
placements of the ends of the axis of symmetry, the so-called “total torsion” of § 13,

_ given by equation (12-2), being

(W’a/ET’) {0-2129410—0-13882307}, 0< <4;

it is clear that for no possible value of 7 can this become negative.

18. CRoss-SECTION A LOOP OF THE LEMNISCATE OF BERNOULLI

The object of this section is to give the correct solution for the cross-section which
is a loop of the lemniscate of Bernoulli, to replace the incorrect solution given by
Young, Elderton and Pearson (1918, p. 61). It illustrates the method of § 14,
and is in fact the problem which led to the discovery of that method. Consider the system of orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates ¢, 7 defined by

(z+c) (z—c) = ce, (18-1)
where € = +i, z=x-+y. Writing
z—ce=7,6%, ztc=re%,
(18-1) is equivalent to 1% — cre, 0,+0,= 27,
or, in cartesian co-ordinates
(x? a y—c?)? | 4xy? _ cte%,
x2—y?—c? = 2xy cot 27,

so that & = const. gives a family of quartic curves (Cassini ovals), called by Basset
(1884, p. 242) confocal lemniscates, with real foci at z = +c, and 7 = const. gives the
orthogonal family of curves, which are rectangular hyperbolas, each of which passes
