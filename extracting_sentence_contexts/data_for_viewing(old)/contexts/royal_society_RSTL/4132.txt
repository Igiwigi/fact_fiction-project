lative intensity of the actinic rays.

Fig, 4. Register of September 5% 12 to 23%, showing the gradual subsidence of the
storm. Scale 20' to 1 inch.

Fig. 5. Portion of the succeeding register of September 6% 0" to 11", on part of the
same $heet as 4. Scale 10' to 1 inch. The line is equally well-defined,
but fainter.

Fig. 6. Register of a term-day, September 23% 10" to 22%, with a photographic base-
line; on which the Greenwich observations were laid down at the Royal
Observatory. This register well illustrates a fact that has been frequently
noticed, namely, the gradual subsidence of slow excursions into-small and
brief disturbances. The scale is 15' to 1 inch.

Fig. 7. Another of the great disturbances of 1846; November 17% 0 to 12% with
base-line, and register of barometric variations magnified five times. The
nearly horizontal portion of the line between 6" 20”, and 30”, indicates
the most rapid movement of the magnet that has been recorded by photo-
graphy. 'No.point of-it could haye been illuminated more than 16%. The
