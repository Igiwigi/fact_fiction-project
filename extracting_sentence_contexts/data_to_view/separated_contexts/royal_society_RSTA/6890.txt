Finally, H(R) = UHA(R,), where

q It is instructive to consider the statement of topological theorems when interpreted in

3 terms of H(D). If f(z) = Sa,z"e H(p), then the corollary to theorem 1-1 shows that the
iS n=0

3 Taylor coefficient a, is a continuous linear functional on H(p). The inequality expressing
A this fact reduces to Cauchy’s inequality. If we denote max | f(z) | by M(r) and the majorant
zl=r

S |a,|7" by Wir), corollary 2 to theorem 1-2 gives Mir) <AM(R) for any R>r (since we

can vary p) and some constant A (depending on r and R). This inequality can easily be

obtained by an application of Schwarz and Cauchy’s inequalities (strong form), but the
corresponding inequality for, say, H(C) with Faber polynomials as base, is less obvious.

We have seen above that the vector space H(r) can be regarded as the dual of an ¥-space
(namely, H(1/r)).
