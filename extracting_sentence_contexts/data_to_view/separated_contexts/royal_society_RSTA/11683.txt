The functions also arise from the theory of partitions. Suppose that we desire the number of two-dimensional partitions of a number such
that the nodes of the lattice descending order of part magnitude is in evidence in
each row but not necessarily in each column, It is immediately evident that the
generating function of such at the nodes of a lattice which contains p,, ps, ..., P, nodes

in the successive rows is

(I). (Bi) A). (Ba) eee) Bn)’

whether the numbers p,, p», ..., P, be in descending order of magnitude or not. This
fact enables us to determine the lattice function and the sub-lattice functions
derivable from the whole of the permutations of the letters a,”«/*...@,?* when we
may suppose the exponents p;, Ps, ..., P, to be in descending order of magnitude and
establishes also that these functions are invariant for any permutation of Pyy Ps +15 Pn

were under view. ‘Taking the lattice corresponding to «;*a,’«, and arranging 6
