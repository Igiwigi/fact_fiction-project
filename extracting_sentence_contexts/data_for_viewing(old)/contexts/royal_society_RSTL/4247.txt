In repeating DuTrocaeT's experiments on the turgid state that the cellular tissue
of plants takes in water, and employing for that effect coloured liquids, it occurred to
me, that the absorbed liquor was not inside the cells themselves, but in the intercel-
lular spaces, which accords with the rapidity of the result, which it would be impos-
sible to understand if the liquid were to proceed from cell to cell and through their
walls.

It occurred to me also, that if endosmose was the only or principal agent of the
ascension of the sap in plants, that is to say of vegetation, this phenomenon ought
to be influenced by the two indispensable agents of vegetation, heat and light. As
there is something rather mysterions in the phenomenon of endosmose, it was not
impoxsible that snch might be the fact. DuTrocter, from an experiment on the
czeum of a fowl, concluded that a rise in the temperature increased both the

rapidity and the quantity of endosmose. In his experiments on acids he even an-
nounces having discovered that the temperature changes the direction of endosmose,
which goes from the water towards the acid, or from the acid towards the water,

according as the thermometer is low or high. At all eyents he does not, generalize
this singular result, which, according to him, belongs only to the acids ; but as a great
many 8aps have an acid reaction, the result onght to be, that, according to the state
