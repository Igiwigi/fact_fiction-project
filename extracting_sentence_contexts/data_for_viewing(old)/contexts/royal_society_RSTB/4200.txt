flagellum, as a whole. Larger, rounded forms, which constitute the more usual phase,
have a more indefinite, irregular movement, performing usually a short glide or
sweep, generally in an are, then stopping and then going on again. In neither case
is there any vibration or turning over of the body. When at rest, however, these forms
frequently exercise little spasmodic jerks or vibrations, tending to partly rotate the
body, but not causing displacement; these are produced by the small accessory
flagellum, I think.

Cercomonas.—The movements of this form have been described by Wrnyon.* 1
need only draw attention to the fact that, when the flagellates are in the most active
condition, being then pear-shaped or elongated, the undulatory vibration of the body
is produced by the active movement of the attached tail-flagellum. On the other

hand, the forward movement is chiefly caused by the somewhat irregular lashing of
the long anterior flagellum, which often causes the body as a whole to swing sideways
to some extent. This movement is very characteristic. In oval, more sluggish
individuals, the only movement is produced by the anterior flagellum and I am
inclined to think that, in these conditions, the posterior flagellum may become
shortened or partly disappear. :

Helkesimastix.—There is nothing to add to the account previously given. There
is a great resemblance between the active undulatory movement (when the individual
