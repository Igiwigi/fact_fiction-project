ever a most fortunate and complete one, must appear of no
small degree of importance, since it not only confirms the
observations and inferences on the long contested lunar atmo-
sphere contained in my Selenotop. Fragm. but also furnishes
us with many more lights concerning the atmosphere of
Planets in general, than had been afforded us by all those ob-
servations collectively,


346 Mr. SCHROETER's Observations

This, and the mathematical certainty that the phznomenon
is, in fact, nothing but a real twilight in the lunar atmo-
sphere, will be farther evinced by the following theoretical
deductions, in which the same mode of computing as was used
in the observations on Venus, will be adopted, with this dif-
ſerence, that theangle f c g, fig. 7, Tab. VI. = AcF,is equal to
the angle Dc EF, or the geocentric elongation of the moon
from the sun.

1. According to the above obseryation, we find that the
twilight at both cusps measured, from c to &, fig. 1 and 2, Tab,
VIII. 20 lines = 1' 20”, The apparent diam. of the moon
being at 6* P. M. = g1' 18”; whence the twilight must have
extended over an arc of the limb, measuring 4* 5g' 2g”; and,
