Microbial eukaryotes, also known as protists, display an astonishing variety of

majority of eukaryotic clades and lineages [1,2], and environmental sampling
continues to reveal hidden eukaryotic diversity that remains uncharacterized
[3]. Microbial eukaryotes are invisible to the naked eye, but they are present
almost everywhere—from human guts and the soils we stand on to acidic
hot springs and Arctic ice shelves—and they play major roles in these diverse
environments. For example, about half of carbon dioxide fixed globally is attrib-
uted to photosynthetic microbial eukaryotes [4]. Moreover, many protists are
characterized by processes and features rarely or never found in multicellular
organisms: silicification, mixotrophy, apicoplasts, extensively fragmented gen-
omes, and much more. However, our understanding of the cell biology,
physiology and evolution of most microbial eukaryotes remains extremely lim-
ited owing to both historical reasons (biased research focus on animal, plant,
