In order to generate suitable cumulate
country rock it is vital that porosity in mushes is occluded by the crystallization of primitive
phases. Geochemical evidence from Icelandic melt inclusion suites indicates that mixing and cooling
of melts are concurrent in crustal magma storage zones. Convection is likely to couple these
processes together and the fact that evidence for both mixing and cooling is preserved indicates


that the times cales of these processes are similar. Simple fluid dynamical reasoning can be used
to show that this equivalence of time scales is expected from mixing in basaltic sills that are less
than about 10m in height. These sill thickness are very similar to those envisioned for oceanic
crustal accretion at spreading ridges on the basis of observations at ophiolites.
