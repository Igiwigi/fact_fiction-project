44. It may be remarked, in passing, that the general credence of geologists in the
cooling at, all of our globe has been more or less disturbed by the celebrated memoir
of LaeLace (Mecanique Celeste, tom. y. cap. iv. p. 72 &.) © On the Cooling of the
Earth as affecting the length of the Day,” in which it has been taken for granted, by
most geologists at least, that the great mathematician has irrefutably proved that our
globe has not cooled sensibly for the last 2000 years. ,

"to 8nuggest that his calculation really proves nothing as to what may be the actual facts in
nature, because the physical data which he has employed are not such as actually occur
in nature. The law of compression with depth adopted was objected to by Dr. YouxG ;
and the assumption that the coefficient of contraction is the same for the entire globe,
whether liquid or solid, hotter or colder, seems to vitiate the results.

If a colder and consolidated crust possesses a greater density and a smaller coefficient
of contraction than the liquid or solid but hotter matter beneath, by accretion and
solidification from which the crust is gradually thickened, it is easy to see that such a
relation may subsist between these quantities that the distance of the centre of gyration
of the globe from its centre of figure may remain constant, either always or for very long
Q periods, although the diameter of the earth as a whole may have diminished by con-
traction ; and thus, since the moment of momentum must have remained unchanged, the
