Images were recorded with a CCD camera (ORCA R2,
Hamamatsu). Advance of bitplanes in the SLM running order was again initiated by TTL signals
from the camera, but in this case repeated through a microcontroller (Arduino Mega 2560) to
improve the fast-switching TTL signal at high frame rates. One limitation of this system stems
from the reduced triggering functionality of the camera and the fact that the camera controller
continually emitted a heartbeat of HIGH to LOW TTL signals independently of image acquisition. This meant it was not possible to reset the running order of SLM bitplanes at the start of each
image acquisition resulting in a variable ordering of raw images in each SIM image sequence. To
accommodate this, each image sequence was reordered post-capture as a first step in the image
reconstruction process.
