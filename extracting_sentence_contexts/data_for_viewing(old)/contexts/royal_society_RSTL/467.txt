prove the modification proposed by LEoNHaRrD!, RiCHTER, Gren, &c, to that part
of the Lavorsrtr1an theory which regards the emission of light during combustion.
Another testimony in favour of their modification, may be drawn-from the vegetable
kingdom. - All plants growing in, places deprived of light, are merely mucilaginous,
But. the mucilage of these plants burns without the emission_ of light. Light, there-
fore, appears not to-be disengaged from oxygen ; else, why not by this mucilage, as
well as by other combustible bodies ?

tated from it by water. Before we-assert a fact, we should-be
well assured of the pureness of- our chemical agents. 'Dhis
supposed conversion of muriatic.or hyperoxygenized muriatic
acid into nitrous gas, will not pass-for a- decomposition, or 2
transmutation, .of that refractory radical; and the idea of the
change of potash into lime, is as erroneous as some other late
-assertions respecting the decomposition of the alkalis.

The proportions of this salt are, as:I before stated,

Hyperoxygenized muriatic acid = = 38,3
