I have not been able to trace directly the hydrocyanic acid which figures in this
equation, but this acid appears unmistakeably in its products of decomposition. The
brown substance which accompanies the 8ulphide of triethylphosphine and the hydrate
of tetrethylphosphonium is rich in nitrogen ; boiled for some time with hydrochloric
acid, it yields abundance of chloride of ammonium. In fact, it was on account of the
presence of ammonia among the products of the reaction, that it became necessary to pre-
cipitate the tetrethylphosphonium in the first place in the form of the gold-compound.

I have likewise examined the behaviour of disulphocyanate of ethylene with triethyl-
phosphine. The reaction takes place with energy at ordinary temperatures. When
triethylphosphine is poured into a concentrated alcoholic solution of sulphocyanate of
ethylene, the liquid immediately solidifies to a dazzling white crystalline mass of sul-
phide of triethylphosphine. It deserves to be noticed that the same decompoxition
takes place also when the substances are allowed to react in the presence of anhydrous
ether. The transformation which the sulphocyanate of ethylene undergoes under the
influence of triethylphosphine is perfectly analogous to the change of the ethyl-compound
when submitted to the same agent. Instead of a derivative of tetrethylphosphonium,
