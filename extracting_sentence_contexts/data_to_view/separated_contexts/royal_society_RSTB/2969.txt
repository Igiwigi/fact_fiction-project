In each species of Palemon,
Hippolyte and Crangon that we have examined, the larva has one or more distinctive
centres, The secondary as well as the primary system is constant, both at the early
and late larval stages. The branch-system aind pigmentation offer other distinctive
features. The great taxonomic importance of the primary system lies in the fact
that the zoea of each species breeds true, and that the resulting primary system is
retained. SECTION VIL. Tur Srructure, RELATIONS, AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHROMATOPHORES.

Very few attempts have been made towards elucidating the structure of the
chromatophores of Crustacea.
