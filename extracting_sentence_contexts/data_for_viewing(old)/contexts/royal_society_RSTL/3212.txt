tremely interesting, if the results of the obseryations at Brest were arranged in
Tables similar to those which accompany this paper, In a classification of this
kind it is necessary that the epoch of the phenomena should be defined by the
minute of the moon's transit ; the day of the moon's age is quite insufficient. A
complete classification of this kind is desirable, because erroneous conclusions
may be drawn from isolated portions of the curve; and it is necessary, in order to
ascertain the agreement between theory and the fact, to compare them through-
out the whole period or extent of the inequality whose effect is considered.

According to the theory of Bzrxovian, and the Tables founded upon it,
which are given in yarious works on navigation #, the yariation in the interval
between the time of the moon's transit and the: time of high water, due to
changes in the moon's parallax, yanishes or is equal to zero when the moon
passes the meridian at 2 o'clock or 8 o'clock (or when 0 — 0, —=\ +x, = 0 or
180). This is directly contrary to our obseryations, according to which the
variation is the greatest at this age of the moon. See Table XV.

According to our obseryations, the time and the height of high water are
the same, whether the moon's declination be north or south ; if any difference
