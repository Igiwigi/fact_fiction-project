the anterior ventral cutaneous vein opens in front into the lateral, behind into the
iliac veins (fig. 14) ; the lateral cutaneous is connected with the g8ubscapular vein in
front and with the caudal and dorsal cutaneous veins behind,

The diagram, fig. B (woodeut), is intended to bring oub these peculiarities of the
venous system. There can be little doubt that, in many instances, alternative. courses
are open to the returning blood, s0 that the venous portion of the circulation is by no
means 80 definite as in the higher animals.

Another point of interest is the tendeney of the veins to enlarge into great irregular
sinuses. The cardinals dilate anteriorly into capacious cardinal sinuses, and the hepatic
veins into an immense hepatic sinus ; the blood from the head is poured partly into
the orbital, partly into the hyoidean sinuses. In fact the majority of the venous
channels, as will be seen by an inspection of figs. 1 and 2, are of a calibre quite dispro-
portionate to that of the corresponding arteries.

Thus the veins of a Selachian have more or less of a lacunar character, reminding
one of what is found in any of the higher Invertebrata, Ib is a question how far
this state of things is primary or ancestral, and how far secondary..

Other matters of general interest are discussed in earlier portions of the paper.
The mos important of these are : the relation of the arteries of the adult to the
embryonic aortic arches (pp. 689-691) ; the renal portal system (pp. 704 and 714 ) ; the
derivatives of the embryonic sub-intestinal vein (p. 709) ; the homology of the lateral
vein with the epigastric vein of Amphibia (p. 717); and the relation of the blood-
