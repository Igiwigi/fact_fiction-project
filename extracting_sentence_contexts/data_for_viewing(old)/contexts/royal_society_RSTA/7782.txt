receiver is on the ground and the transmitter is elevated. By combining both cases the
effect of having both the transmitter and receiver elevated can be calculated. If hy
and h, are the heights of the transmitter and receiver respectively above the ground,
then the signal strength at the receiver is obtained by adding to the value worked out
with both assumed on the ground, the gain reckoned from the ground up to hp, plus the
gain reckoned from the ground up to /;. We thus get the benefit of the large initial
gain close to the ground twice over, and the net gain is considerably greater than would
be obtained by raising either the transmitter or the receiver alone to a height hyp+hp.
For a given value of hy +h, the optimum arrangement, if practical, is to make hy, = hp.

It is here that the importance of the fictitious radius |r, | comes in. With both the
transmitter and receiver elevated it is necessary for the line joining them to clear the
fictitious sphere of radius | r, |, if the signals are to be unobstructed by the intervening
earth. This means, for instance, that on 10 m. the line joining them must clear the
surface of the earth by about 225 m., as will be seen from (5-15).

The absolute values of signal strength at the surface of the earth are dealt with
in the next section, but assuming for the moment the results there obtained, the height-
gain analysis can be used to prepare a set of graphs for various wave-lengths, giving
the signal strength for 1 kW. radiated, against distance from the transmitter for various
heights of the receiver above the ground. Fig. 10 shows a typical set of curves drawn
for A= 10 m., ¢ = 5 and ¢ = 10-' e.m.u. Above the tangent plane and for distances
within about 100 km., where the first term of the diffraction formula no longer pre-
dominates, the curves have been calculated by the simple theory of a direct ray and
a reflected ray, using the reciprocal theorem, and taking into account the imperfect
