the limited lifetime of quantum memories.

— Quantum error correcting codes play an important role in realizing fault tolerant
quantum computing systems, and have also been put forward as a means to eventually
realize all photonic quantum repeaters in the future [8]. Here, our algorithm can be used a
design tool to find the measurements to realize a specific target state from a given source
state.

We will phrase our results in terms of graph states, which enables us to apply existing
algorithmic methods more easily. Graph states form a strict subclass of stabilizer states, which are
described by simple undirected unweighted graphs. The vertices in the graph represent qubits
initialized in the state |+) = (1//2)(|0) + |1) and edges represent controlled phase gates between
the corresponding qubits. Any stabilizer state is in fact single-qubit Clifford equivalent to some
graph state [9]. Furthermore, a graph state that is single-qubit Clifford equivalent to a given
stabilizer state on n qubits can be found efficiently in time O(n>). Thus, if we find an efficient
algorithm that decides if some graph state |G;) can be reached from |G,) by LC + LPM + CC, we
also have an efficient algorithm for the more general case where the target and source states are
stabilizer states.

Let us now phrase our problem in a way that forms a natural relation to graph properties. To
this end, we introduce the notion of a qubit-minor in the following definition, which precisely
captures whether a graph state can be reached from another by LC + LPM + CC.


Definition 1.1 (qubit-minor). Assume |G) and |G’) are graph states on the sets of qubits V and
