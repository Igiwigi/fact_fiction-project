AND GEOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF CERTAIN HOT SPRINGS. 575

springs, little preface seems necessary. I haye found much to confirm the views
stated by Dr. Dausexy and others as to the connexion of hot springs with fissures
and lines of elevation. 'The remarks which I have to make respecting the Pyrenean
waters chiefly occurred to myself from personal examination ; though I believe several
of them are contained in the little known and less read works connected with that
country. It is a fact worthy of remark, that the literature connected with the hot
springs of the Pyrenees is very extensive, to the amount even of forming a small
library. An examination and analysis of these works, and of the manuscript. collec-
tions formed by persons connected with that country, could scarcely fail to be really
valuable. In a medical point of view the quantity of information is immense, and in
many cases at least I have reason to believe that it.is faithfully collected and impartially
recorded. The objects of my inquiries brought me frequently in contact with the me-
dical officers of the thermal establishments, from whom I received much kindness, as
well as valuable information; and amongst the multitude of proprietors or of at-
tendants at the baths from whom I had often minute inquiries to make, I can scarcely
recall a case where I was not received with the utmost civility, and even zealously
aided in my experiments. 'To M. DarraLvs, Inspector of the Eaux Bonnes, M. Ba-
