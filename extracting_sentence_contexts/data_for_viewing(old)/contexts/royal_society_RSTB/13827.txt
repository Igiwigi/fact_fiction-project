attention on the evolution of music, producing a great variety
of evolutionary theories that range from Pinker’s controver-
sial description of music as evolutionary cheesecake [76] to
purely adaptationist views [77,78]. Because these ideas have
been reviewed and discussed elsewhere (e.g. [6,79,80]), we
will not examine them in depth. Instead, this section
addresses: (i) issues in the evolutionary study of music and
(ii) some major ideas in the evolutionary theories of music,
enabling us, in §4, to propose a theoretical model for the evol-
ution of musicality.

(a) Difficulties in the evolutionary study of music
Besides the fact that music does not seem to play an obvious
direct role of biological relevance for survival and repro-
duction, the evolutionary study of music must face the
problem that musicality is likely to consist of different, rela-
tively independent components. Strong evidence for this
can be found in the cases in which a disorder affects either
pitch or rhythm processing, but not both (for reviews, see
53,66,81,82]), indicating the independence of these modules.
This means, as Fitch [6, p. 174] points out, that different com-
ponents of musicality might have followed independent
evolutionary paths, and that ‘questions like “When did
music evolve?” or “What is music for?” seem unlikely to
have simple unitary answers’.
