On taking
these elements out of the warm water and bathing them with cold water, I constructed
a pile, closed the circuit, and had a first deflection of 12 in the direction of the mus-
cular current, and the needle stopped at 0%. After having renewed the internal
surface of the muscle by making a fresh section, I recomposed the pile, and the signs
of the current were the same as before. And also in this case I assured myself of the
fact, that the conductibility had not been sensibly changed by the action of the hot
water. I will add, moreover, that it is not to the repeated washing in pure water at
the ordinary temperature, that the diminution in the intensity of the muscular current
is to be attributed. I have very frequently seen the same deflection slightly varying
in intensity, produced by a pile of a given number of elements, or half thighs, some-
times washed in pare water, at others not washed at all.
