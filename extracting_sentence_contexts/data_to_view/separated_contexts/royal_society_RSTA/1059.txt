In this case, figure 7b demonstrates that the
frequency of fibre oscillation is modulated higher when under the influence of the incident vortex. The acoustic signal for this case is suggestive of a superposition of the rigid-fibre noise signature
with higher-frequency oscillatory content that is due to the fibre oscillations. This high-frequency
content is modulated in the same manner as the time history of @ in figure 7b and indicates that
the changes in the acoustic signature arise primarily from the fibre oscillatory motions; the fact
that the vortex paths of these three cases are virtually coincident lends support to this claim. The
additional noise component due to fibre motions increases the peak acoustic pressure value in the
aeroelastic case. Figure 8 plots the paths of the incident vortex given the initial position Zp = —6 + Yoi
with € =1.
