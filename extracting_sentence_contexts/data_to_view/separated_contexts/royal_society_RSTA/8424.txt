RICHARDSON: THEORY OF THE

Thus if x, ¥, h represent accelerations of the sphere relative to the earth, we have for
the three dynamical equations

in. which only the positive value of the square root must be taken. Since the motion of
ordinary winds is practically horizontal, the upward velocity or upward acceleration
relative to the air is practically the same as that relative to the ground, so that in
symbols

h = dryldt; Ie = Tei. oti pane ope ered 1

Now s is the distance along the curved path, reckoned zero at the vertex, and increasing
with time; and s is reckoned relative to the air, so we have

and the dynamical equations simplify to

in which in contrast to (1), (2) and (3) there is no need for a special statement about sign. The equations are much simplified by the fact that the upward speed is usually much
greater than the horizontal relative speed. For example, in a uniform wind of 10 m/s.
the steel ball, the size of a pea, is shot up with a muzzle speed of 150 m/s, at a tilt of
0-15 radian and reaches the earth again with a speed of 37 m/s. So as the ball emerges from the muzzle
