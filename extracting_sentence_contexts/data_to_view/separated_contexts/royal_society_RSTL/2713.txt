As the thickness of the plate increases, more and
more of the distinct image, D, is polarized in the same plane, as in mother-of-pearl*,
till at a certain thickness the whole of it is thus polarized. In this case all the doubly
refracted light which forms the nebulous image, AA, and the bright one, D, consists
of two oppositely polarized pencils, the one forming the nebulous and the other the
distinct image. In investigating the cause of these phenomena, we must take as our guide the ana-
logous facts presented by certain composite crystals of calcareous spar. Having long
ago described this class of phenomena very fully, I shall only state at present the
general fact. Let AB CD, fig.
