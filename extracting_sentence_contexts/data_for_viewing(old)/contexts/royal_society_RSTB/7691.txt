insect wavering to one side, with the onset of back-to-front image movement, would be able
to reach an orientation where there was no longer any actual back-to-front image move-
ment by perhaps quite a small turn. And, if hit by a gust in this position, it could eliminate
the resultant back-to-front component in its image movement by quite a small increase of
air speed, demanding less effort than the larger increase required while oriented directly
into wind. But having made this turn, it would of course be drifting sideways and experi-
encing transverse image movement in a roughly up-wind direction. This should, on the
theory advanced for up-wind orientation, evoke a compensatory turn up-wind. Given
a wind speed higher than the insectâ€™s maximum air speed, however, such an up-wind turn
could not be a successful compensatory response, for it would demand an increase of air
speed which the insect cannot make. Yet what the insect actually does, turn down-wind, will
not be a completely successful response either, for the front-to-back image movement it
experiences while flying down-wind will be excessively fast. In fact, as was apparent in the
field, such locusts are in an unstable condition.

It seems that, for a locust faced with this dilemma, direct front-to-back image movement
at an excessive rate is more tolerable than transverse image movement at a somewhat less
but still excessive rate, as well as more tolerable than even quite slow back-to-front move-
ments, so that the down-wind orientation is taken up.

Two possibilities should be kept in mind with regard to this down-wind orientation.
First, there must be an upper as well as a lower limit of retinal velocity at which optomotor
responses fail. It may be that the image movement, being at its maximum rate in down-
wind orientation, becomes so fast in a strong wind as to be blurred; a situation equivalent
to no image movement and evoking no response. The actual turn down-wind might also be
