Con- organisms is still largely unknown. For membrane transport,
cerning the subcellular localization, the main FC activity is involvement of the membrane-bound ABC (ATP-binding cas-
detected in chloroplasts and has very low activity in mitochon- sette) transporters and TSPO, was proposed in animal cells
dria [6,7], although the possibility of mitochondrial localization [11]. In fact, ABC transporters, such as ABCB6 and ABCG2/
of FC cannot be excluded [8]. In the green algae Chlamydomonas BCRP, are involved in tetrapyrrole trafficking in mammalian
reinhardtii, a single FC encodes a plastid-localized FC protein cells [21,22] and Arabidopsis vacuolar ABC transporters
[9], while in the red algae Cyanidioschyzon merolae, FC is only AtMRP1-3 can transport chlorophyll catabolites to the vacuole
found in mitochondrial extracts [10]. These results suggest during chlorophyll degradation [23].
