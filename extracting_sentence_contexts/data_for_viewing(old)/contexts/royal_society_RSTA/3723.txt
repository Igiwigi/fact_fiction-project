Note that the symmetries of the elasticity tensors C and B imply that A© and A®) are symmetric
second-order tensors, and thus A is also symmetric. In addition, the symmetry of tensor h implies
that P=".

As shown in Gourgiotis & Bigoni [4], A®) is a singular tensor that always possesses one null
eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector n, i.e. A@)n = 0. The same property is shared also by
the tensor I’, which is related to the microinertia of the continuum. In fact, it can be readily shown
that

I'n=0 and detr=0. (3.5)

An immediate consequence of the properties of the tensor I is that, if h is positive semi-definite,
the two (non-trivially null) eigenvalues of I are always non-negative. Under these circumstances,
the tensor I + I is always positive definite, and thus invertible. The latter observation enables us to
recast equation (3.2) in the form

[A — pw? IJM'/*d =0, (3.6)
