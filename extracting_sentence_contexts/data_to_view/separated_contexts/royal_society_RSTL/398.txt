The idea of a northern indraught into St. George's Channel,
(but which applies equally to the current west of Scilly) is
clearly set forth, in a publication by Captain Joszen MEa, in
1757; but which only came to my knowledge very lately,
by the favour of Mr. Purpy ; to whom I stand indebted, also,
for the knowledge of the important fact of the get of forty-six
miles, during the calm, in the Chops of the Channel. Captain Mxap first relates the case of the ship Hope of
Liverpool, bound from the coast of Guinea, to that port, in
November 1735. (Preface, page ili.)

« Having had a good observation, by which they found
« they had the Irish Channel open, the wind continued to
« blow strong from between the south and west, but mostly
« from the former. Having no other observation ſof lati-
« tude] for six days, in which time, they carried' sail, con-
« $tantly, they by reckoning expected to fall in with Cape
« Clear; but in the following night, they fell in with the
« Blasquets.” These islands and rocks are situated in lat.
52% 10'; or about forty-eight miles to the north, and one de-
gree of longitude to the westward of Cape Clear.
