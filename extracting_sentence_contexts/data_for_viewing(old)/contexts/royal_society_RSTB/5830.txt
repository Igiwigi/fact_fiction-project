foetuses), and therefore old corpora lutea have been taken as a sign of the early post-
partum phase. These, however, generally dwindle away and disappear soon after
parturition, and are not often available. Another sign of the early post-partum phase,
the enlarged uterus showing obvious placental sites on macroscopic examination, is
definite while it lasts, but, like the presence of corpora lutea, is only transient.
The great variability in the subsequent involution of the uterus makes it difficult
to seriate accurately later post-partum material. Lactating mammary glands
are an obvious criterion of the post-partum phase, but while active they give little
evidence of the stage. Our chief difficulty has been in diagnosing (a) lactating animals
for which mammary glands were not available, and (b) one or two later post-partum
animals which showed no evidence of lactation. â€˜The situation is complicated by the
fact that during the involution of the uterus the segments in between the placental
sites may show a condition similar to that found during pro-cestrous enlargement.
Examination of the uterine glands and reference to the Fallopian tube has been found
of assistance in these cases; the Graafian follicles give no clear indication of the post-
partum condition. A general classification of this material has been achieved firstly by
examination of the mammary glands, and secondly by considering the weight and
histological appearance of the uterus; when the glands were not available, classifica-
tion has occasionally been difficult.

Fig. 1 shows in diagrammatic form the main points involved in arriving at the repro-
ductive state of a given specimen. This diagram covers all observed categories except
where the death of a litter results in the association of a regressing mammary gland
with an early post-partum uterus.
