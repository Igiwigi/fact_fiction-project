Postscript added August 29, 1842. 217. I gladly avail myself of the permission accorded by the President and Council
to append to this communication, in the form of a Postscript, some additional facts
illustrative of the singular properties of iron as a photographic ingredient, which have
been partially developed in the latter articles of it, as well as an account of some
highly interesting photographic processes dependent on those properties, which the
Superb weather we have lately enjoyed has enabled me to discover, as also to describe
a better method of fixing the picture, in the process to which I have given the name
of Chrysotype; that described in Art. 212. proving insufficient.
