It need not be held that the chromosomes in a ring are attached only by their
extreme tips. There is evidence that short terminal portions, probably varying in
length in different cases, are paired side by side. The shorter these are, the more
likely they are to be pulled apart in the jostling movements which clearly take place
during prophase and metaphase. Chiasmata may also occur between these short
paired ends ; but their numbers will be very few compared with the numbers which
have been assumed to form and terminalize along the whole length of the
chromosomes.

It may be pointed out here that the high frequency of non-disjunction in all the
catenated Oenotheras, leading to a high frequency of trisomic mutations, appears to
be a direct result of the fact that the bivalents are not paired throughout their length
but that each catenated chromosome is attached at its ends to two others.

The nature of catenation

Linkage of chromosomes in diakinesis and first metaphase is now known to occur
not only in Oenothera and Datura but in a number of other genera. It can be
induced in Datura by crossing “B” races with a standard line (BELLING and
BLAKESLEE, 1926). In Oenothera, the crossing of two uncatenated forms can give
rise to an F, with a ring of 4 or a ring of 6 (Gates and CarcuesipE, 1931). In
Pisum, the crossing of certain races which have long been separated will also give
rise to chromosome rings (PELLEW and SAnsomE, 1931, E. R. Sansome, 1933). The
rings of 4 and 6 discovered in maize (McC.intock, 1930, Brink and Cooprr, 1932)
