Inspection
of the figure shows that there are now no abrupt variations in the graph, but the
amplitude varies within wide limits, and the phase is continually shifting. Increasing
the magnitude of the disturbances simply increases the amplitude: the graph remains
smooth. At one point, in fact, the “ disturbance ” was inadvertently magnified by an
error of calculation, but there was no appreciable kink in the graph to direct attention
to the blunder. It is, of course, true that the graph may be made to pass through any
assigned series of points, however irregular, but to introduce such irregularities appro-
priate large and erratic disturbances must be given: abrupt irregularities do not
naturally occur with random disturbances. It is of interest to look a little more closely into the question why the graph does
present such a smooth appearance, An undisturbed harmonic function may be regarded
as the solution of the difference equation
