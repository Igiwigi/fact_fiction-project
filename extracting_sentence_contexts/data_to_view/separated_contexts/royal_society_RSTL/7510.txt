The Halleian
'| S hypothesis, and the incontroyertible facts on which it rested, were for a time obscured
'S by the prevalence of a uniaxial hypothesis, in which the points of maximum force were
2 asumed to be identical with the points where the inclination is 90?; around which, as
'Z their centre, the isodynamic and isoclinal lines were supposed to be arranged symmetri-
\S cally in parallel lines; hence the term magnetic pole came, in the uniaxal hypothesis,
b= to be attached to the points where the inclination is 90*, that element being the easter
= of determination, and consequently the one most popularly regarded. But the accept-
© ance of the uniaxial hypothesis has gradually yielded to the progressive advance of
|S observational knowledge; and one of its ablest expositors (BoT), as far back as the com-
E mencement of the present century, was constrained to admit that, even in the case of
a apparently the most simple of the three elements (viz. the Inclination), a single magnetic
* axis would afford no snfficient explanation of the phenomena, unless it were supple-
mented by the supposition of subordinate centres ; whilst as regarded the known facts
of the Declination and Intensity, they must be held to be wholly inexplicable on the
8upposition of a single magnetic axis (Report of the British Association, 1837, p. 64). Preserving, therefore, the sense in which HALLEY employed the term magnetic pole,
and in accordance with the evidence, now fully established by observation, of the exist-
ence of four such points on the surface of the globe, the magnetic equator is most pro-
perly defined as the line connecting those points in each geographical meridian where
the intensity of the earth's magnetism is less than in any other point situated in the

curvature.
