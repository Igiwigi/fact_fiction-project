Moreover, AED has direct and indirect impacts on plants
under conditions of soil moisture deficit; higher AED increases plant hydraulic stress and the risk
of xylem embolism and plant mortality [45]. No matter how much water is in the soil, increased
AED can cause plants to take in less carbon and do less photosynthesis [42,43]. AED’s diverse effects are complicated by the fact that the influences of AED on droughts ‘3
vary, depending on drought type (hydrological versus agricultural and ecological), climate SS
characteristics (i.e. water-limited versus radiation-limited regions) and precipitation variability :B
[41]. Thus, during periods of available soil moisture, the effect of AED on plants is usually {=
positive, as high AED correlates with high temperature and radiation, favouring photosynthesis ia
and carbon uptake. On the other hand, when soil moisture is low, higher AED makes plant stress : =
worse.
