Using both (2.6) and (2.7), the first result to note in this paper is that there exists a bounded,
weighted, double hierarchy of their time averages proved in [15]:

Theorem 2.1. For n>1 and 1<m<ow, weak solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations obey

(Fri), <Â¢nmReâ€™ + O(T~). (28)

Note that for n = m = 1 we have the correctly bounded energy dissipation rate for the standard
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, from which one can easily obtain a Re*/4 bound on
the inverse Kolmogorov length Lat. In fact, as noted in [15], theorem 2.1 in its fullest form
encapsulates all the known Leray-type weak solution results in Navier-Stokes analysis which
are distributional in nature but not unique [19-23]. In [15], it was also shown that to prove full
regularity (existence and uniqueness of solutions) we would need to prove that

Deen
(Fri ) <0. (29)
While this remains an open problem, there is no evidence that any bounds with the factor of 2 in
the exponent exist. Indeed it is possible that weak solutions are all that are available.
