By reflecting on certain facts connected with the respiratory movements, and which
seem to derive no explanation from our actual knowledge of the structure of the
spinal chord, I was induced to undertake a series of observations with the view of
determining, if possible, the relations which appear to subsist between the spinal
nerves and the respiratory nervous centres. These observations, however, led me
into a more extended inquiry than I at first contemplated, the results of which I now
venture to lay before the Royal Society.

It is needless to point out the difficulties which attend, not only the minute investi-
gation, but a clear and connected description, of a structure s0 intricate and delicate
as that of the spinal chord. It may be proper however to state, with regard to the
contents of this paper, that those facts only which were verified by cautious and re-
peated examination have been brought forward with confidence ; while in cases where
the results of my observations were less satisfactory, I have expressed myself with
corresponding reserve. Yet, no labour has been spared in order to arrive at correct
conclusions. My observations were made, by means of one of Mr. Ross's finest
microscopes, on many thousand preparations of the spinal chord of Man, of the Calf,
Sheep, Pig, Dog, Cat, Rabbit, Guinea Pig and Frog, and occupied a period of more
than two years.

In making these preparations, the two following methods were adopted :â€”a per-
fectly fresh chord was hardened in spirits of wine, s0 that extremely thin sections, in
various directions, could be made by means of a very sharp knife. A section s0
made was placed on a glass slide and treated with a mixture composed of one part
