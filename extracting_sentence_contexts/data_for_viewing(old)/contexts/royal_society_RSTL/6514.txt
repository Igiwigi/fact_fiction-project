On the Oxidation effected by the Perozide of Hydrogen.

We have seen that the peroxides of hydrogen, potassium, and barium possess certain
chemical properties which do not belong to the analogous compounds of lead and man-
ganese. An elaborate attempt* has been made to account for the different reactions
of the two classes of peroxides, by the assumption that there are two kinds or varieties of
oxygen, a positive and a negative variety ; it is said that the peroxide of manganese acts
as an agent of oxidation because it contains the negative variety, and that the peroxide
of barium acts as a reducing agent, because it contains the positive variety of this
element. This hypothesis finds its only support in an imperfect and incorrect view of
the facts. In truth no such fundamental distinction exists between the properties of the
different peroxides as that which it is proposed thus to characterize. The chemical pro-
perties of the alkaline peroxides, as of other chemical substances, vary with the condi-
tions in which they are placed, and the substances with which they are associated ; and
it is in our power 80 to modify these conditions as to produce with these peroxides the
very same effects of oxidation as are produced by the peroxides of the other group. This
is evident from the following examples, to which it would be easy to add others :â€”

1. An acid solution of peroxide of hydrogen causes the conversion of a solution of
ferrocyanide to ferricyanide of potassium.

2. An alkaline solution of peroxide of sodium added to a solution of a protosalt- of
manganese forms hydrated peroxide of manganese.
