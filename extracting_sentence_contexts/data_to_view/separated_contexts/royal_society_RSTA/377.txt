The values of # involved range from about } million in a small supersonic wind
tunnel up to 100 million or more for a large shell, and it seems likely that in covering this
range laminar and turbulent boundary layers are involved, but there are reasons for thinking
that in applications to supersonic wind tunnels the boundary layer of the model is more
likely to be laminar over most of the range. Therefore while both cases are likely to be,
ultimately, of practical importance, the obvious course is to concentrate first on the laminar
layer which seems to be of immediate value in model work. An additional reason is provided
by the fact that the laminar layer is much more tractable analytically. PART I. GENERAL SURVEY AND DERIVATION OF THE EQUATIONS
2. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS It is well known that, although, strictly speaking, the influence of viscosity extends over
the whole field influenced by the body, solutions of the boundary-layer equations possess
the property of approximating closely to their asymptotic values a short distance from it,
and that thereafter, for all practical purposes, the influence of viscosity can be neglected.
