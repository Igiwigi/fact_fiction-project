But, if we had written (2Q)' for R’,
the coefficient, which now stands at — 42,8, would have been — 3. In like manner,
as P and Q are travelled on in the scale, R® and S* become indefinitely near to 2Q

3 Let A, p, v,... represent the halves of the Hypothenusal Numbers in the triangle
Ziven at the commencement of the paper, i.c., the differences of the numbers which
Sve have called p, g,7,..-

Since

in the hypothenuse,

Let us write

for a second approximation.

* Asa matter of fact, it will be found that, as soon as g and p attain the values 6, 24, g? — $ q' may
be taken as a superior limit. It may be noticed also, to prevent a wrong inference being drawn from the
above expressions, that, as will hereafter appear, 7 is an infinitesimal of the order 1/q*, when q is
infinite.
