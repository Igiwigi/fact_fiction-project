This gives the HCM-based multiple access approach a huge flexibility advantage
as the code size can be adaptively changed without disrupting existing connections.

(i) System performance for an ideal channel

It is informative to examine the ideal channel case to understand the system limitations when the
transmission bandwidth is larger than needed for the symbol rate used. The decoded vector in
this case can be rewritten as

rp ~ e
v= witht Naip, (2.7)
where r represents the clipping coefficient that describes the power loss due to clipping. Using the

fact that x can be modelled as approximately Gaussian, the clipping coefficient, r, can be calculated
from the Bussgang theorem [21] using

where erfe(x) = (2/,/7) [°° exp (—u?) du. The effective noise vectors after the IFWHT operation are denoted as n= (n/N)(H}, - Ay)

1
=1- <= |erfc

and clip = (Naip /N)(H}, - Ay) in (2.7). oF represents the variance of dy. Therefore, after HCM


demodulation at the receiver, the bit error rate for the kth user using M-PAM HCM for non-
dispersive channels can be approximately calculated from [22] as

BER, © , (2.9)

Me=1 ote 3 Pp
2Mx logy Mx J2(MB - 1) N(of + 033;

which is a standard approximation of the BER for M-PAM.

(ii) System performance for a dispersive channel

A dispersive channel introduces ISI between HCM symbols and interchip interference (IChI)
within the codewords; in this paper we ignore the ISI, assuming a large enough N is used to make
the interference between adjacent symbols relatively small. (If not, a cyclic prefix or guard-time
between symbols can be used as in OFDM.) The received signal vector after the IFWHT operation
can be represented as in [12],

- - \2d-1 B ._ .
v=rf (Hy — Hy) F(Hy — Hy) tg tit Reip, (2.10)
where F= >, h[¢]I and 1 represents the ¢th right cyclic-shifts of the identity matrix.
