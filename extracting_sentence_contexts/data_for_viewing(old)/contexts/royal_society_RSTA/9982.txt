where X and Y have the values given in (1), and for p we must substitute the
expression (18), remembering, however, that we must ultimately restore the factor Pow
We may also temporarily omit the factor C in the expression for the electric forces.
To find the current function R we must eliminate 8, but owing to the fact that p
contains 6 and X, this does not seem to be possible directly. The difficulty must be
turned by eliminating in the first place R, and if 8 is then found, R may be
determined from the first of the above equations. It may occur to the reader that R
might be more directly obtained if the resistivity were introduced instead of the
conductivity. ‘This is true, but the results are less valuable, as may be seen from the
fact that, as suggested above, the Fourier expansion may have to be applied to the
conducting power in so far as it depends on the position of the sun. If the resistivity
were introduced as the variable, the high and possibly infinite values which the factor
would take when the conductivity sinks low or vanishes would present difficulties
much greater than those met with by keeping the conductivity as the variable
quantity.
The elimination of R requires in the first instance the reduction of
