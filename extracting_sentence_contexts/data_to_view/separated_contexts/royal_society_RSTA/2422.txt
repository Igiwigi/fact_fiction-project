Conclusion and future perspectives

Since 16 MW of fusion power was achieved in JET in 1997, the headline progress in fusion has
appeared to the outside world to slow down. This belies substantial technical progress and greatly
improved understanding of the science and technology in the field. However, it is representative


of the fact that fusion requires a burning plasma, where the fusion reaction provides products
which sustain the reaction, before fusion on a commercial basis can be considered possible. ITER
will provide that demonstration, and as such is critical to the success or failure of commercial
fusion power. UKAEA will continue to contribute significantly to ensure ITER reaches its goals,
in many technical and scientific areas and in providing expert advice to industry—many of ITER’s
needs can be satisfied by existing industrial capabilities.
