is of no interest since u is a population and thus needs to remain positive. The interesting result [8

from an ecological point of view is that the minimum speed decreases compared to equation (2.2)
as the delay increases.

(a) Population dynamics

The situation is different if the population growth is damped by a strong Allee effect (after the :
American zoologist W.C. Allee). The Allee effect has to do with the fact that the fitness of small 72

populations is sometimes negative, i.e. if the population density is too small, the species or group : =
of individuals will not survive. In other words, the zero steady state is stable (figure 3a). To model Dm
a)

this effect, an extra factor is added to the reaction term of the FKPP equation. Let us consider a [3
population whose growth is described by a cubic polynomial :2
is

ut = Dux + au(1 — u)(u — a), (3.1) aaa
