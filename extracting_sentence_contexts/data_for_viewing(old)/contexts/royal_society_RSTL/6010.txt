E 16. I remark, in paxsing, that the problem of finding the circle of curvature at a given
int of a plane curve, is in fact that of determining the conic having with the curve
at the given point a three-pointic contact, and besides passing through two given points.
The equation of a conic having an ordinary contact, is
D*U—IIDU=0,
where
I1I=aX+bY+cZ.,

and the condition of a three-pointic contact is
ax+by+ez=2(m—2).
Let the coordinates of the two given points be

(12 Ys 22); (ws Yar 2a)
