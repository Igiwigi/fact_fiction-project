Wrx I had the honour last year of presenting an apology
for the unfinished state in which Mr. HuNTER left the Croo-
NIAN lecture, I laid before this learned Society the plan upon
which he meant to proceed ; but my mind was at that time
unfitted to prosecute s0 arduous an inquiry. The progress Mr. HunTer had made in this investigation
enabled him to prove the crystalline humour of the eye to be
laminated, and the laminz to be composed of fibres ; but the
use to which these fibres are applied in the ceconomy of the
eye he had not ascertained, although several experiments were
instituted with that view : his opinion was certainly in favour
of their being muscular, for the purpose of adjusting the eye
to dilterent distances by their contraction and relaxation. MDCCXCV, B


2 Mr. Home's Lecture

Being unwilling that a subject on which Mr. HuxTzer had
So publicly given his opinion should remain in an unfinished
State, I requested the President's permission to be allowed to
give the CRooNnIan lecture for the present year, as it would
afford me an opportunity of weighing with impartiality the
facts already ascertained, and of endeavouring by my own la-
bours to add to their number. In prosecuting this inquiry, I consider myself to have been
particularly fortunate in having had the assistance of my friend
Mr. RAMsDEN. It was a $ubject connected with his own pur-
Suits, and one which had always engaged his attention ; he
was therefore peculiarly fitted, both by his own ingenuity
and knowledge in optics, for such an investigation.
