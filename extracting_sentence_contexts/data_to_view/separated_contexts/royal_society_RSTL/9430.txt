The writhing movements of
the polypite under these cireumstances are often very decided ; but they are usually
wonderfully late in beginning, This is probably owing to the prolonged and uncertain
period of latency which, as stated in my previous paper, is manifested by the polypite
of Aurelia ; for even in experiments where the contractional continuity of the umbrella
tissue has not been destroyed by section, the response of the polypite to strong stimu-
lation of these tissues does not begin till after the violent contractions of the umbrella
have been in progress for a considerable time. $2. Effects of Erhaustion in impeding the passage of contractile waves â€”In my
various modes of section of Aurelia I have several times observed a fact that is worth
recording. It sometimes happens that when the connecting isthmus between two
almost severed areas of excitable tissue is very narrow, the passage of contractile
waves across the isthmus depends upon the freshness, or freedom from exhaustion, of
the tissxue which constitutes the isthmus. That is to say, on faradising one of the two
tisxue areas which the isthmus 8erves to connect, the resulting contractile waves will
at first pass freely across the isthmus to spread all over the other tissue area; but
after several such waves have pagsed in rapid s8nccession across the isthmus, it may
happen in some preparations that every now and then a contractile wave fails to pass
across the isthmus.
