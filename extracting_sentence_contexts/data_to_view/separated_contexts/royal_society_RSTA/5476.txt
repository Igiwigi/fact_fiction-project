On the other hand, RESP > RR | SAP
decreases significantly from rest to tilt in the HF band, which has been previously documented
and reflects a weakening of the non-baroreflex respiratory sinus arrhythmia mechanisms during
postural stress [25]. Finally, we find that the inclusion of instantaneous causality increases the
HF values for all the measures. This fact, that was previously observed for cardiorespiratory
interactions assessed during postural stress [9], can be explained if we consider the instantaneous
effects as fast (within-sample) contributions to the dynamics of the system. The analysis of the PB database (figure 5 and tables 3 and 4) shows that LF values are small or
negligible for all measures. This confirms the lack of respiratory sinus arrhythmia effects in the
LF band seen before when RESP is the driver [24], and indicates thatâ€”contrary to the postural
