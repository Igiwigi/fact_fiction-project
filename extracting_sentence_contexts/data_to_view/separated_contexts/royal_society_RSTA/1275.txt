Define, for t € [0,1], the line segment joining Mg and ini ie. & =(1— eg + t&. Since &


lies in the interior of UM 1 The and pg ¢ UM iT ix’ there exist a 0 <t, <1 such that &; € UM 1T;
for all t € [t,, 1]. Due to the convexity of I(&), and. the fact that (ug) = = 0, we have

1(E,,) < (1 — te)U(me) + to) = belo) < LE),
thus reaching a contradiction. Hence,

inf [(é)= inf 1(&), (5.5)

and the minimum is achieved on 4 UM 1 The proving equation (5.3). In view of equation (5.3), in order to prove equation (5.4) it is enough to show that

inf 1(é)= inf, (6).
