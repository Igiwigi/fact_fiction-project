Any specimen of Carchesium, in which this double clustering of ingested matter
demonstrable, can, as I have said, be induced to perform the single movement
suitable change of food; it would seem, then, that we are dealing rather
inconstant stimuli than with inconstant response of cell substance. And the whe
variation is valuable, mainly, I think, because the slower changes which chara ‘
it are of help in the attempt to analyse the quicker, usual movement. The somewhat detailed description which I have given of this phenomenon
aggregation may tend to obscure the fact that it is, in Carchesiwm, but one phase i
the sequence of digestive change ; that all the important transformations immediatel
bound up with solution of food are yet to follow. It ends the period of quiescence
during which most ingesta tarry within the basal curve of the nucleus; and
precedes a second mimic peristaltic movement, which, since the ingesta pass one
more towards the peristome (though on the side of the polype opposite to that
which they entered), may perhaps be distinguished as the movement of retrogressioi
(fig. 2, B, a,b).
