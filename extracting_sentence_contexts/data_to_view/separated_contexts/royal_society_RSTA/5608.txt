Under these
circumstances, the expected number of positive tests is

Np(t) = (1 — B)pl(t) + 1 — B GE) + ag{S(t) + RD). (3.1)

Accordingly, the assumption that the number N,(f) of positively tested is proportional to the
number I(t) of Infectious holds only if 8’ =1 and a =0 (which is unrealistic [26]), or if q =0 (ie.
if ‘healthy’ people are not being tested). Otherwise, N,(f) can be quite misleading. In fact, the
term aq(S + R) may dominate the other terms, if a large number of people without symptoms are
being tested (corresponding to ‘mass testing’, addressed in SE of the electronic supplementary
material). In such a case, the majority of positive tests would be false positives, and the number
of positive tests would increase with the overall number

Nr(t) =pl() + IS) + E(t) + RD] (3.2)

of tests made. Testing a large number of people without symptoms might, therefore, produce
pretty arbitrary and misleading numbers, if appropriate statistical corrections are not done.
