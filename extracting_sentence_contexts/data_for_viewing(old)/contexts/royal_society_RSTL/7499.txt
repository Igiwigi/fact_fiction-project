DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL IN THE OSTRICH TRIBE. 115

bones; for although the bone-layer of a cartilaginous plate or rod may never affect the
cartilage-cells at all, yet it is always inside the perichondrium. The splint bones may
enfold persistent cartilage, or this pi#h may be absorbed ; whilst in other cases we find
the secondary bone rambling away far from the cartilage which served at first as its
model, and running up and down any aponeurotic tract that may be available for it.
Splint bones are not called 8econdary because of any lateness in their appearance—they
are the first to appear; but cartilage is the first, or embryonic skeleton, and in certain
low Vertebrata never takes on a calcareous condition.

One important difficulty turns up in this part of our research, and that arises from
the fact that certain parts of the face, viz. the pterygo-palatine arcade, ossify as early
as the earliest splint bones, whilst the tissnes of the embryo are still simply cellular.
Careful attention to this matter has led me to see that the difficulty is not at all insu-
perable, and that it does not in the least affect the distinction between the two classes
of ossifications. TI shall explain this more perfectly in subsequent papers ; yet it seemed
necessary to me to premise my description of the struthious skull with some remarks on
the histology of the ossifying structures.

I must remark, further, that in studying RaTHkE's beautiful researches (by the
help of Professor HuxLey's translations), 1 have been often confused by the use of
the term * cartilage,” both for condensed tracts of fibrous tissue, and for the true, or
hyaline cartilage. The loose use of this term in Rarake's most invaluable works
makes it necessary that those who follow him should repeat his observations in every
