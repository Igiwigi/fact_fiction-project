'Shat the true candal fin of the Dipnoi has become all but aborted like that of various
Aeleostei ; and that the apparent caudal fin is formed by the anal and dorsal fins
Jneeting round the end of the s8tump of the tail.

@ From the adult forms of Dipnoi we are, however, of opinion that no conclusion can

form of caudal fin.

= The general conclusions with reference to the tail fin at which we have arrived are
| he following :—

BS (1) The ventral lobe of the tail-tin of Pisces differs from the other unpaired fins in
he fact that its fin-rays are directly supported by spinous processes of certain of the
Swmal arches instead of independently developed interspinous bones.

S (2) The presence or absence of fin-rays in the tail fin supported by hamal arches

EXCRETORY AND GENERATIVE ORGANS.
5 I.—Anatomy.

5 The exeretory organs of Lepidosters have been described by Mile (No. 13) and
Rave, (No. 11). These anatomists have given a fairly adequate account of the
generative ducts in the female, and HyRrTL bas also described the male generative
