ES these only in the first of the four separation-years.

A Ibis practically absent from the samples taken from the plots where aminonia-salts
are applied, whether these be used alone or in conjunction with mineral manures. It
has gone down, but in a less degree, where nitrate of soda has been used. It has
also gone down on the plots most favourable to Leguminosz in general, and where it
increased considerably in the early years—namely, those where mixed mineral manure,
including potass, was employed. Finally, it has maintained a more uniform position
on the unmanured plots, where there is no laxuriance of any species, than anywhere
else ; but here, in the later years, it has only contributed about 2 per cent. of the total
produce. Tt has, in fact, not maintained even moderate prominence where there was
any luxuriance of the grasses; and where the conditions were more favourable for the

plants of the same family. It has, however, sustained the competition much better
than 7. repens.

There are other species of this genus which occur on the plots, but only in
insignificant proportions, viz. —
