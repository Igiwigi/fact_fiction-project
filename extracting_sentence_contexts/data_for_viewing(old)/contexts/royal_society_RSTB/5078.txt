stage. ‘The presence of constrictions at diakinesis and at the anaphase of the second
division points to the constancy of these features as part of the chromosome structure.


NESTA FERGUSON: THE ALOIN#. 231

As the work for this paper was nearing completion, a contribution to the cytology of
Gasteria was published by Taytor (31). In the genus Gasteria Taynor failed to find any
distinction either in the number or the morphology of the chromosomes in the nuclei
of the species which he examined. In the individual nucleus, this investigator observed
no difference between the three pairs of small chromosomes at heterotypic metaphase.
He found, however, that one of the large pairs was always different from the other three,
owing to the fact that the point of attachment of the spindle fibre was not terminal but
at a distance from the end equal to about one-third the length of the chromosome.
During the homotype division this investigator found that the three small and the three
undistinguished large chromosomes have each a rounded protuberance at one end, while
in the fourth large chromosome a constriction, separating a large segment from the main
body of the chromosome, corresponds in position with the point of attachment of the
spindle fibre during the heterotype division. At this point the spindle fibre was
attached, and for the other six chromosomes the attachment lay behind a well-marked
protuberance.

Tn a still more recent communication TayLor (32) gives further details concerning
the structure of the chromosomes of the somatic nuclei of Gasteria and compares them
with those of two species of Aloé and of a species of Haworthia. The results given bring
