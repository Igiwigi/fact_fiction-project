surviving pinewoods of the fen margin (e.g. at Ub). At 70 cm. the estuarine deposits
give place to fresh-water deposits and then to Sphagnum peat: pollen of hazel and of
mixed-oak forest trees remain high, but pine pollen diminishes, since, as we have
already seen, by this time the marginal pinewoods were being covered by Sphagnum
peat.

The rise of birch pollen in this part of the diagram may well be a local effect pro-
duced by birchwoods growing on the raised-bog surface, as in the site next discussed.

Trundle Mere B (fig. 17).

This site is certainly that of the four most removed from the influence of the fen
margin, and of the fen margin woods, and, as we have already indicated, it is this fact
which appears to be responsible for the high pollen values of hazel and mixed-oak
forest trees.

There is at the base of the diagram some indication of the formation of brushwood
peat, and this corresponds with high values for alder pollen and low values for oak and
hazel. From 120 to 60cm. again, there is a layer of brushwood in the peat corre-
sponding with a maximum of birch pollen, and this certainly appears to be a purely
local effect.

With these two exceptions the diagram seems to be a far more trustworthy index to
the drift in forest composition of the countryside as a whole than the three other sites.
