afternoon

B denotes the time of high water at the London Docks, as deduced from
Burerr's Tables.

G. do. from Warre's Ephemeris.
L do. from British Almanac.
[0] do. as observyed.

Wherever blanks occur, it is to be understood that there has not been any
tide observed or predicted, â€”as on the afternoon of Jan. 15; or that the objects
of comparison fail, as on the afternoon of Feb. 13, and morning of the 14th,
where BuLeit would indicate a tide at 11" 52m, which did not in fact occur,
and give no tide for the morning of the 14th to compare with an observation
on that day.

June 8, 1832.
