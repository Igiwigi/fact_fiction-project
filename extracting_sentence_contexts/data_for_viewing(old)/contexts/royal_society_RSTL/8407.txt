139. Mr. Forprs's further experiments on basic slags from Staffordshire blast-fur-
naces, © cast into sand moulds,” are vitiated through just the same reasons as those on
the Rowley Rag.

140. Lastly, Mr. Forprs adduces some measurements made at Birmingham on blocks
of cast glass cast in iron moulds, which either showed almost no contraction or (according

to Dr. LLoyp, of the Park Glass-Works) one of only 43 lineal, on blocks the largest of
which was but 40 1bs. weight, and not rectangular in form, being lenses in fact. We
shall sce further on what reliability there is in these last.

141. A few experiments on the expansion of rocks at high temperatures, but far below
the fusing-points, by R. W. Fox, are recorded in the Philosophical Magazine for 1832
(3rd ser. vol. i. p. 338). Granite increased in bulk at a dull red heat by from 45 to #5,
porphyritic felspar (from an © elvan course ”) the same; clay-slate augmented in size, in
the direction of the cleavage, 5 to #2, by redness scarcely visible in the dark, and green-
stone x5. The whole of these statements look unreliable, and it is not clear whether he
means cubic or lineal dilatation. -

142. BiscmoFy's final results have been summarized by Mr, ForBrxs as follows :—
