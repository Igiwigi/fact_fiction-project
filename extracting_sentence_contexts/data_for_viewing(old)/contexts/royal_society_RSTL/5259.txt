«From these observations it would appear that the composition of the atmosphere,
as regards the proportion of oxygen and nitrogen, scarcely varies more as we ascend
through the first half of that atmosphere (for at an altitude of about 34 miles one-half
of the atmosphere lies beneath us), than it is found to vary at different spots upon
the surface: that there is, in fact (as Gay-Lussac had long since announced as the
result of his experiments, made at a time when the methods of gaseous analysis were

less perfect than at present), no sensible difference in the com-
position of the atmosphere upon the surface, and at the greatest
heights accessible to man.

* In quantities of air 80 limited as those at my disposal, it
was not possible to determine accurately the proportion of car-
bonic acid which they contained, Its presence however was
