gives us ideas about the intensity of the electric field at each point. Figures 3a and 4a show the
fringing electric field emanates from the driving electrode and terminates at the sensing electrode;
it can reach the inside of the testing sample through the designed air gap. The influence of
adhesion on capacitive coupling can be observed as the electric field lines are distorted, thus
altering the inter-electrode capacitance.

In the case shown in figure 3b-d, the spherical air void of various sizes is held beneath M1,
placed at the centre of adhesion. They are acting as dielectric resistance to the electric field due
to the fact that permittivity of air is much lower than that of the sample. With larger air void
