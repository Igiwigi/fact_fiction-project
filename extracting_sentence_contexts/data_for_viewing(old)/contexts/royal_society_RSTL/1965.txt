cate that the crystal has six faces arising from the law ex-
pressed by (p, q, 7) and (8) (p, p, 7) may represent a crystal
with three faces arising from the law (p,p, 7); which is
what would, according to Havy, be called a decrement on an
angle at the summit.

It often happens that faces in a crystal are repeated ; that
is, that there are faces parallel to one another, one of which
may be considered as a repetition of the other. In that case
we may distinguish them by placing a 2 before them as a
multiplier. Thus 2 (8) (p, p, 7) indicates a rhomboid pro-
duced by repeating each of the three faces represented by
(?,P,7). This is in fact the mode in which a rhomboid is
always produced, In the same manner 2 (6) (p, q, 7) is the

symbol of a dodecahedron, which results from repeating
each of the six planes (p, q, 7).
