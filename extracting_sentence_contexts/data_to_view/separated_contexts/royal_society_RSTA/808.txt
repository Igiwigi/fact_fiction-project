These rate coefficients appear to be consistent with reaction (1.1) proceeding with nearly
every collision between the species. This is indeed the case in the QCT calculations, where
the capture rate, defined as the rate for entering the ionâ€”molecule well, is essentially the same
as the overall reaction rate. In fact, the SIFT rate coefficients reported here are slightly larger
than the parametrized collision rate by Su & Chesnavich [4], which takes into account only the
polarizability and permanent dipole moment of the neutral species. Despite the fact that our PES has the same long-range terms as in Wei et al. [10], our calculated
rate coefficients are much larger than the earlier QCT results. The difference can thus be attributed
to the different level of the ab initio theory.
