that abundant finds in the peat bogs bespeak a rich Bronze Age population of the area,
but that any lakeside settlements of this age must tend to have been destroyed or buried
by the widespread Sub-Atlantic flooding.

It has been pointed out that the flooding developed progressively and took time to
reach its worst, and that differences in height and accessibility to flood water must have
caused differences in the march of response to flooding in various parts of the raised-bog
system. Thus, although in a general sense contemporary, there is scope for some minor

differences in dating between the various trackways, corresponding with the fact that the
Meare Heath and Shapwick Heath trackways appear to lie close to the (uncertainly
defined) opening of zone VII-VIII, and the Westhay trackway near the middle. All
three presumably are of Middle to Late Bronze Age.

It is not unlikely, in view of the circumstances under which the trackways were built,
that the Blakeway Farm trackway is also of this age, a suggestion a little supported by the
nature of the axe-cuts in it. Similarly, should it prove possible to uncover again a part of
the Abbottâ€™s trackway, it will be of great interest to discover whether it had origin at the
same time in response to the same circumstances.

We may in conclusion note that if this dating of the trackways is accepted, we derive
interesting evidence of the status of trees employed in their construction. Thus the recogni-
