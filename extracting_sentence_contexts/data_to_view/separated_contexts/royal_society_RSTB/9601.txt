Furthermore, prospero is asymmetrically distributed
into the GMCs in crustaceans and its expression coincides
with the onset of asymmetric division of the neuroblasts,
suggesting that it acts as a neural cell fate determinant similar
to the case in insects [15,86]. However, Snail must have an
additional earlier function in crustacean neurogenesis
because it is the earliest gene to be expressed in neuroblasts
and there is a considerable time delay between neuroblast
formation and the start of asymmetric divisions [15,86]. The
fact that snail is expressed before ASH suggests that the
former rather than the latter gene is required for neural cell
fate determination. This potential function of Snail is sup-
ported by data from D. melanogaster showing that Snail can
activate neuroblast fate genes such as grainyhead, numb,
prospero and seven-up [80]. Furthermore, Snail could be
involved in the symmetric divisions of crustacean neuro-
blasts, which occur before the start of GMC production
(figure 3) [15].
