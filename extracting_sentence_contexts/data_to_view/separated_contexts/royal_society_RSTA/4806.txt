The diffusivity of gold in solid lead is, however, slow when compare
with diffusion in the fluid metal. The diffusivity of gold in lead at 500째 was sho 7
in the first part of this paper to be 3:0 In solid lead, on the other hand, thi
diffusivity at 250째 is 0-03, or ydoth of the diffusivity at 500째. It is also clear that gole
will diffuse into solid lead at the very moderate temperature of 100째, which is 226
below its melting point, a fact which must be considered to be remarkable, and on
the existence of which has hitherto been unsuspected. The diffusivity is, howev
only zgslyooth of that which occurs in fluid lead. any complication which might arise if the cylinder were heated by fusing gold on to the lead.
