In Part IV. we have some curious facts illustrative of the necessity and value of ex-
perimental research. In the earlier experiments of the inquiry it is evident, that angle
and T iron beams or frames are not the best, as regards form, to resist a transyerse
strain. In every case they are weak, and although exceedingly useful, and in fact
indispensable for many purposes of construction, they are nevertheless not calculated
to resist strain in the form of beams or girders. These defects I have endeavoured to
obviate by the introduction of beams with double flanges formed of a body plate and
riveted angle-irons at the top and bottom. All these latter constructions may how-
ever be left with safety to the practical engineer F.
