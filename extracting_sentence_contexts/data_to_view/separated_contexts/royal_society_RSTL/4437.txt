regarded the molecular structure of bodies but as an expression of the law of their
synthesis and analysis, and this law again as a result of the peculiar nature of che-
mical force. It was therefore truly difficult to conceive how an element in the sense
of BerzeLIvs was formed. The formation of this © uncombined particle ” was a fact
quite different to the formation of a compound substance, and yet it seemed as
unreasonable to suppose that the laws of chemical action should vary in different

fore considered attentively what we really knew of the laws of chemical change in
these bodies. Examples occurred to me, both of the chemical division and che-
mical synthesis of the elements, by which various phenomena hitherto obscure might
be explained.
