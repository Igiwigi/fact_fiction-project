also appear for increasing elasticity at a fixed Re. As their name implies, each DW comprises two : =
concentrated vortices with a narrow but strong inflow boundary between them. Each vortex pair : =
is independent to other solitons, separated from each other by regions of purely laminar Couette 13
flow. This asymmetry between inflow and outflow regions is characteristic of the DW instability : =
[41,67,92]. At the centre of the inflows, the fluid initially accelerates near the outer cylinder, ik
reaches a maximum velocity at the mid-gap, and then decelerates. Although the structures are [3
stable, they can merge if their distance reaches a critical value, which was reported to be five times : =
the gap width by [67]. However, [47] reported that the number, and thus the distance between the : Ss
DW depends on the deceleration rate of the inner cylinder, suggesting a spectrum of polymer :3

relaxation times f, governing the appearance of DW if the instability is considered purely elastic.

The fact that the velocity profile across the core of the DW is not dependent on the elasticity
number and that the DW appear even at very low Re, below the stability limit of the base flow,
lead [67] to hypothesize a purely elastic nature for this instability. Thomas et al. [125] also observed
FP and DW numerically in TCs of purely elastic fluids, enforcing the previous hypothesis.

The appearance of DW is attributed to a phase lag between the velocity gradient du,/dr
and the polymer elongation when the time scale of the cross-gap movement for a polymer
becomes comparable to its relaxation time (d/u; * te) [67]. This results in hoop stresses towards
the inner cylinder pumping energy into the flow and giving rise to the DW. Another, self-
sustaining mechanism for the appearance of DW is proposed by the numerical work of [126,128],
suggesting that small perturbations of the azimuthal velocities on the outer cylinder lead to stress
gradients, which pull the fluid radially close to the outer cylinder and axially close to the DW
core, regenerating the stress gradients. The origin of DW structures was also associated with
