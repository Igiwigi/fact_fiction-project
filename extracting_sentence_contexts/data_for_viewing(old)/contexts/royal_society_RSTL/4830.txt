Accordingly, we might expect that the action of iodide of methyl upon leucoline,
and the snbsequent decomposition of the iodide produced by means of protoxide of
Silver, would enable us to reconvert leucoline in this manner into quinine. This
metamorphosis would be the more interesting, as it would open a source for the arti-
ficial production of quinine; leucoline being, as is well known, contained in consi-
derable quantity in the basic portion of coal-tar naphtha. It may be stated here that
lencoline, which is a substance remarkable for its antipathy to the crystalline form,
when submitted to the action of iodide of methy], solidifies at once into a splendid
mass of crystals of a new iodide*, which in fact resembles in its outward appearance
hydriodate of quinine, and which is still under examination. I am, however, by no
means sanguine as to the result of this experiment, for the above play of formulze
rests as yet, on a yery precarious foundation ; neither the formula of quinine nor that
of lencoline being established beyond a doubt. Nevertheless, I intend to complete
this investigation, because even if no other result is obtained, yet by means of this
process new data for ultimately fixing the formula of quinine and lencoline may be
found.

In conclusion, it may not be out of place to consider how far the preceding
researches affect the received views regarding the constitution of the ammonia-
salts. Without reproducing all the arguments bronght forward by the supporters of
the various theories, we may remember that, irrespectively of the impossibility of
