MtEscHer’s experiment the rise of blood pressure due to the activity of the so-called

g vaso-motor centre of the medulla being awakened ; in WoroscuILorr’s, the movement
3 of the upper limbs of the animal, due, as he believed, to the awakening of a convulsive

centre in the medulla. The index used by Mizscuer being the amount of hlood
pressure, had the great advantage that it varied with the strength and duration of
the afferent stimulation, and thus a quantitative comparison between the results of
two series of stimuli was possible, and it is, perhaps, due to this that the facts have
been held as affording data of so cogent a character. They show first that the
reaction of the centre, as indicated by rise of pressure, is very largely reduced when
the lateral column on the opposite side of the cord to that of the excited sciatic nerves
has been divided; and second, that when a complete intervening division of the
cord, with the exception of one lateral column, is made, the reaction still persists,
being most marked when the distal nerve on the side of the complete section is
