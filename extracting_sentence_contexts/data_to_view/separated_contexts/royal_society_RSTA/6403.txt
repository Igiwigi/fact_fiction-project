However, there were
confounding factors that reduce confidence in this conclusion. Most importantly, Walshe et al.
[12] noted that in addition to the different ventilation rates in the boning hall and abattoir, the
occupancy rates were also different, with higher transmission also being associated with the
higher occupancy area (see ยง3b). Therefore, the study in fact showed that the combination of
improved ventilation and lower occupancy was associated with lower transmission. This limits
the quantification of the effect of ventilation alone. Additionally, the viral load present in the boning hall (where the outbreak originated) may : =
have been different from that in the abattoir, which could have impacted the differences in : =
secondary infection rates.
