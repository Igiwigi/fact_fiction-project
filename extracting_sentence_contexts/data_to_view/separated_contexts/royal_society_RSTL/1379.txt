The cornea from this investigation is proved to be com-
posed of two lamine, the external a continuation of the ten-
dons of the four straight muscles, the other a continuation of
the sclerotic coat, and the uniting medium between them is
not unlike very fine cellular membrane. C2


12 Mr. Home's Lecture

If the cornea is examined at its attachment to the sclerotic
coat and tendons of the strajght muscles, it appears to be of
exactly the same thickness with those parts, but grows thicker
towards the centre ; this increase of thickness is principally
in the external lamina, for when that is removed, the other
appears equally so through its whole extent. To ascertain that the cornea is really thickest in the middle,
I made a transverse section of it, and Mr. RAMSDEN, with $e-
veral other gentlemen, examined the cut edge through a mag-
nifying glass, and all of them were satisfied with the fact of the
central part being evidently thicker than that which was nearer
to the circumference. It is necessary to mention, that in stretching the cornea
the central part yields most readily to the power applied; this
is 80 much the case, that if the cut edge of the cornea is
examined while it is several times drawn out and allowed to
contract again, the change in the centre will be found the
most distinct ; the principal elasticity appearing to reside in
that part. i

Before these experiments were made upon the cornea, Mr.
RAMSDEN had promised me that he would contrive an instru-
ment by which the cornea might be examined, while the eye
was adapting itself to different distances ; so as to enable us
to decide whether any change took place at these times in its
external figure.
