The well-documen-
ted history of transfers of flat oysters, and likely the parasite,
too, from California to France and Spain, and thence to
other regions of Europe, has been previously described [28]. Bonamia ostreae prevalence is greatest during warm months,
but infections show no strong seasonality [83]. In fact,
in vitro experiments showed greater survival of the parasite
at 4-15°C than at 25°C [84]. Density and handling stress
appear to enhance infections, which develop more rapidly
in cultured than in wild stocks [29]. In 1986, the New Zealand dredge oyster, Tiostrea (Ostrea)
chilensis, suffered a loss of at least 60% in the area of Foveaux
Strait.
