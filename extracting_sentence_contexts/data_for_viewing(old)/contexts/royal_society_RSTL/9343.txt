It would, as he observes, © require us to 8uppose that the ice was much more de-
veloped in Ben Nevis and the region to the west of the Caledonian Canal than in the
hilly district around the sources of the Spey.* . . . . Otherwise they (the glaciers),
would have occupied the watersheds or cols at the time the terraces show they were
clear of ice.”

The reason he suggests for conditions 80 anomalous, is a difference in the precipita-
tion of snow such as now exists in the rainfall of the same districts. He refers to
the mean annual fall at Fort William of 86 inches, and at Loch Nevis of 82 inches,t
whereas at Laggan ib is only 46 inches. But Laggan is as far from the hills in
question as is Forb William, and more recent observations given by Mr. SYMONDS
(f British Rainfall,” 1876-7) show that the rainfall ab the Bridge of Roy is in fact
62 inches annually, and that that place comes within the line of above 50 and under
75 inches fall. \

Mr. Jamresox's view is, however, supported by the authority of Professor TYNDALL}
who considers that the position and greater height of the mountains south of Glen
Spean caused them to intercept the moisture carried by the Atlantic winds which
would therefore have reached the hills north of that glen in a state of greater dryness
and warmth.

But the difference alone between the height of the hills from the wes coast at Mull
to Ben Nevis and of the hills eastward of Ben Nevis, is, on the whole, with the
8ingle exception of this and one adjacent mountain, s0 small, that the effect of greater
