Secondly, the thinnest plate makes the broad-
est ring (the diameter of the rings being in the inverse subdu-
plicate ratio of the plate's thickness); just s0 is it with fringes
by flexion; nearer the body the fringes are broadest, and their
diameters increase in the same ratio with the diameters of the
rings by plates whose thickness is uniform; each distance from
the bending body therefore corresponds with a ring or fringe
of a particular breadth, and the alternate distances correspond
with the dark intervals : the question then is, what becomes of
the light which falls on or passes at these alternate. distances ? In the case of thin plates, this light is transmitted in other
rings: we Should therefore be led to think that in the case of
the light passing by bodies, it should be at one distance in-
flected, and at another deflected: and in fact the phanomena
agree with this, for fringes are formed by inflexion within the
Shadows of bodies; they are separated by dark intervals ; the
fringes and the intervals without the $shadow decrease in breadth
according to the same law; s0 that the fringes and intervals
within the shadow correspond with the intervals and fringes
without, respectively. Nor will this explanation at all affect
the theory formerly laid down; it will only (if found consistent
with farther induction) change the definite spheres of inflexion
and deflexion into alternate spheres. At any rate, the facts here
being the same with those described by NewTox, but in diffe-
rent circumstances, teach us: to reconcile the difference, which
