Once gregarization is complete and we are dealing with locusts of the
gregarious phase, however, sustained locomotion does not depend on circumstances that
are exceptional in any way. If the behaviour of the solitary phase, or of most animals for that matter, be taken as
a standard, then gregarious locusts are clearly abnormal in embarking on a course of
sustained locomotion when conditions are in no way extreme. But the fact is that such
behaviour is normal for gregarious locusts (p. 226). Under favourable conditions the
solitary (or non-migrating gregaria) locust makes only intermittent movement through the
day, periods of movement falling between longer periods of feeding, basking, mating, etc. Under the same conditions, the migrant keeps up extraordinarily persistent movement,
‘sedentary’ types of behaviour, such as feeding and basking, becoming restricted in con-
sequence to early morning and evening.
