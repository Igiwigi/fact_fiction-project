In the context of a fitness game I= (X, w), an individ-
ual’s feasible set is the set of strategies X. The individual
with whom (s)he is matched to interact—the opponent—
also chooses some strategy in the strategy set X. To capture

As an illustration, in example 2.3 the unique ESS is x the fact that an individual’s ranking over own strategies
m/(2—k). This is found by noting that any ESS x"°° must solve may depend on what strategy the opponent is expected to
use, a preference function is some function u:X?—R
that associates a real number with each pair of own and
opponent’s strategies. If the individual strictly prefers some
strategy profile, say (x, y), over another, say (x’, y’), then u
