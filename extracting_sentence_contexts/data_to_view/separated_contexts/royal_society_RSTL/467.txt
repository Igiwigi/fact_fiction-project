There is, however, a still more extraordinary formation of this
acid, in the distillation of nitro-muriatic acid upon platina. Oxy-
gen is absorbed by the metal ; yet, not only oxygenized, but also
hyperoxygenized muriatic acid is formed. I have repeated the
experiment several times; and am well convinced of the fact,
however contrary to theory it may appear. I have tried the
action of oxygenized muriatic acid upon nitric acid, in the hopes
of forming hyperoxygenized muriatic acid; but there was no
action to this effect among their elements. The fact of the production of a peculiar gas, by the distilla-


upon oxygenized and hbyperoxygentzed muriatic Acid, &c. 165

tion of nitro-muriatic acid upon platina, has been observed by
