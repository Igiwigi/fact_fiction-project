OLIVER LODGE ON ABERRATION PROBLEMS.

its value being easily obtainable if ever wanted. The displacement of Fraunhofe
lines due to the Sun’s rotation is a small thing to detect with a prism spectroscop
but this effect of motion on terrestrial sources, if it is ever to be seen, is 660 time
smaller.

70. It may, perhaps, be well to check over our results by the less geometrica
method employed by Sir GrorGE SroKEs, viz., by expressing the fact that the inter:
section of the three waves (incident, reflected, and refracted) with the mirror is a joint
intersection, and runs along the mirror at a pace which can easily be written down
(viz., AC/t); for the wave-advances through the medium at a speed V, and th
medium helps it along with a component of its drift velocity v cos (@ + €); so th
total speed of the joint wave intersection as it runs along the mirror is

V + vcos (6 + e)

sn(i+te) ”
which it is easy to see is precisely the same as what we should have obtained by
attending to rays and to the figure, viz.,

AC _ Vcose + vcos@
t ~ sin(i + e)/cose *

So the equations for reflection and refraction can be written down at once, thus:

V+veos(i—pte) V—veos(i’+p—e') Vip — v/p?cos(j — o — e”)
sin (i + e) a sin (i’ — e’) = sin (j — e”) 2

together with the values of the aberration angles, obtained, say, by resolving th
wave and drift velocities perpendicular to the ray, or resultant direction of advance
and expressing the fact that they must neutralize each other ;

” sin € sin & p sin e”

Vv sn@i—$) sin’ +4) sin(j— 4)

These two sets of equations contain the entire solution, and of course » may b
wrilten p/p, if it is a question of passage from one medium to another instead 0!
from vacuum to a medium; the V and v then expressing speeds in first medium.

71. In Sir GeorcE Arry’s* beautifully performed and described experiment of the
value of the coefficient of aberration measured by a zenith sector full of water, there
should, we see, on FResNeL’s theory, have been a slight discrepancy, but one wholly
too small to observe with the various inaccuracies inseparable from star-light. If it
is to be detected it must be with light from a terrestrially fixed source.
