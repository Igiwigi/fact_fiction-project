OF THE ELECTRICAL ORGAN OF TORPEDO MARMORATA. 341

» organ. It was shown by Moreau * that in a curarised and immobile fish the organ
» was still capable of responding by a vigorous reflex discharge to external stimulation
' of the skin. I have made numerous experiments which have confirmed this fact ;
_ indeed, the smartest shock I ever received was from a medium-sized curarised
' Torpedo, which I grasped when quite immobile between my hands, On dissecting
' out the nerves I found that electrical stimulation of the spinal cord and motor nerves
produced no muscular contractions, whilst vigorous electrical responses of the organ
- followed excitation of the electrical nerves. The fish were readily curarised in from
two to three hours by the injection of 0°5 cub. centim. of a 1 per cent. solution under
‘the dorsal skin near the tail. This being the case, it was certain that the strip of
Sieurarised organ would respond, like the uncurarised, to the passage of an induction
LSphock, as was found to be the case. It is, therefore, not improbable that the stimula-
tion of the column by an induction current is not analogous to the direct electrical
excitation of curarised muscle, but to that of nerve, it being an excitation of the
pe amerable nerye branches which pervade the transverse protoplasmic septa of the
