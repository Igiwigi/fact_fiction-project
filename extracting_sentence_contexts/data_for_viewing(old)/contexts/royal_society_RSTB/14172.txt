Social interaction in primates is fast-paced, multi-modal and highly contingent
[1-3]. Used in noisy and uncertain environments characterized by fission—
fusion social dynamics [4], primate communication systems must provide various
ways to deal with hitches, breakdowns and other forms of communicative trou-
ble. Human joint action, for instance, is well-known for its system of
communicative repair. Repair refers to the process by which communicative trou-
ble is fixed, by a producer who repeats, elaborates or otherwise modifies a
troubled utterance either by their own initiative (self-initiated repair, [5]) or in
response to a recipient’s prompt or explicit signalling of misunderstanding
(other-initiated repair, [6]). Across the world’s languages, other-initiated repair

interaction are resolved so frequently bears witness to the cooperative nature of
human interaction [8,9], emphasizing the pivotal role of repair in human joint
action coordination. Indeed, repair has been tacitly assumed to be part of
