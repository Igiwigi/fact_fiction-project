dioecy, where an individual is either male or female, in the
two groups. Dioecy is derived, and relatively rare in most
land plants [3,13,14], whereas the vast majority of animals,
and the presumed ancestor, are outcrossing gonochorists
[1], referred to hereafter as dioecious for simplicity (see Box
1). There are several ways this might lead to differences
between plant and animal sex chromosome systems.

Land plant sex chromosomes are generally homomorphic
[1,3], although with notable exceptions in Cannabis [15],
Rumex [16] Silene [17] and Coccinia [18,19]. Several have
hypothesized that the low level of divergence between
plant sex chromosomes, in general, is a result of the fact
that dioecy is derived and, therefore, phylogenetically rela-
tively young in land plants [20,21]. The prevalence of
homomorphic plant sex chromosomes is in sharp contrast
to the highly conserved and diverged sex chromosomes in
some animal groups, such as therian mammals, birds and
Lepidoptera [22,23]; but is heteromorphy really the rule in
animals? One could argue that these clades represent the

Divergence of X and Y gene content can also bring with it exception in metazoans, as the vast majority of animals
differences in gene dose between males (with one X chromo- either determine sex without sex chromosomes [1] or with
some) and females (with two X chromosomes). Differences in homomorphic sex chromosomes [24,25].
