Minimizing the elastic strain energy of the surface
by reducing its modulus lowers the equilibrium barrier for fracture of the adhesive interface
[21]. Therefore, by lowering the modulus of the surface material, the adhesion of solid fouling
materials can be reduced dramatically. In fact, while the interfacial free energy difference between
smooth surfaces of a high energy metal such as iron (2.4J m~*) [22] and the lowest energy material
Coo Faz (0.0067 J m=?) [23] is only a factor of 100, the modulus between a hard and soft surface
can vary over as many as 5 orders of magnitude [24,25]. Thus, when bulk deformation occurs,
