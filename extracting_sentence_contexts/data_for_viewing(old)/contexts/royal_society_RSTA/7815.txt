Fic. 2â€”Curves S and B and observations H represent vertical illumination in kilolux. The abscissae
show time from 3-5 p.m. (G.M.T.) on February 15, 1934. Curve S refers to the selenium cell ;
curve B to the Burt sodium cell and recorder ; the two circles denote observations with the
potassium cell, photometer H. ( was determined with the selenium cell.

fact that we made no selenium cell measurements at these outstandingly bright
moments ; they occur usually after a S.W. gale with heavy rain, when the clear
air and large white clouds overhead combine to produce a brief period of very
intense vertical illumination.

Turning now to the daily records, it may be seen that the increase in the vertical
illumination and the sudden changes it undergoes are very great, far greater than
one would suppose from visual observation. The adaptation of the eye, from a
moderate illumination of about 16 lux to a bright one, 500-1000 lux, only reduces
