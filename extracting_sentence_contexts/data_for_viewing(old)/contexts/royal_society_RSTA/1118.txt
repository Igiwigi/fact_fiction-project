and does not explicitly depend on the unknowns &" and the potentials x“(&). Hence, the first
variation of the action S = [ A dé with respect to 5x” gives the Euler-Lagrange equation

dy Ay =0, (2.6)

where we introduced the notation Ax = 0A/ axi, and the Einstein convention of summation over
repeated indexes is assumed. There are only four conservation laws in (2.62) for 16 unknowns
xi. The remaining 12 equations are indeed hidden within the integrability conditions of any
configuration gradient, i.e.

ap xh — ax =0, aXb. (2.6b)

In fact, system (2.6) consists of 24 equations, where 12 of them are effective evolution equations,
ie. those for a,b = 0, while the other 12 are the so-called involution constraints, see [8,44], that are
pure spatial constraints, conserved along the particle trajectories.

(b) Eulerian equations of motion

Existence of the Lagrangian coordinates &” is a mathematical idealization and their practical use
for general fluid-like motion is usually very problematic. Therefore, our unified approach to fluids
and solids [16,50] relies on the reformulation of governing equations (2.6) in the Eulerian frame
and later, on the replacement of the integrable (global) deformation field &“,, by the non-integrable
(local) distortion field A which can be seen as a local basis tetrad (or non-holonomic basis tetrad).
Therefore, in this section, we formulate equations of motion in the Eulerian frame which are
obtained from the Lagrangian governing equations (2.6) by changing the unknowns &" — x“, see
