Solid lines are fitted power laws to low-frequency and high-frequency portions of the power spectra,
and horizon dashed lines are expected shot-noise levels (Pelton et al. 2007).

there is a greater opportunity for some other transition, such as ‘on’ to ‘off’, to
occur. This possibility is absent when the photoexcitation is at low energy. So in
this case of an ‘on’ state there can be a difference in the log-log plot, depending
on the excitation energy.

There are several additional facts that reflect on the mechanism. The §, to P,
transition seen in figure 6 is known from a S, — P, infrared absorption spectrum
occurring when a hole is deliberately created by coating the surface of the QD
with a thiocresol. A photoexcited thiocresol readily loses an electron to the S.
state in the conduction band to the QD (Shim & Guyot-Sionnest 2000), and
so the S, > P, optical transition can be observed. Another relevant observation
involves evidence that the trapped hole is localized and diffusing about rather
than distributed as a band over the surface of the QD. Evidence of a diffusing
charge is seen in the effect of an alternating electric field on the fluorescence
of the QD (Park et al. 2007). A possible explanation of the effect of both
enhancement and decrease of the fluorescence when the field is increasing is
that of a trapped charge hopping from site to site on the surface rather by a
delocalized band.
