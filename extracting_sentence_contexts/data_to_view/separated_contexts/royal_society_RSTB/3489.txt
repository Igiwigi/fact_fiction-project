Further, in Hiin and Marrtiy’s Specimen M, the original cellular continuity, between
the trigeminal ganglionic expansion of the neural crest and the edge of the medullary
plate, has seemingly disappeared to a somewhat greater extent than even in the
nearly related Specimen H; and this in turn shows a far less intimate and extensive
continuity than is present in the earlier stage represented by Specimens Z and ZZ. Nevertheless, even in Specimen M, and still more in H, we find in the sections, in
certain planes, a definite persistence of the original connection between the ganglionic
plate and the edge of the medullary plate. As a matter of fact, Hm. and Marrin were influenced in their interpretation by
SeLeNKA’s view of the mesodermal character of the unquestionably similar head-plates
which he observed in the cephalic region in Didelphys (86-7). They quote his
judgment with regard to these, that they “ gehéren offenbar zur Urwirbelplatte des
Kopfes.” There can be no doubt that SrLrenKa was entirely mistaken in this
judgment.
