Leaf-traces.—As already stated, the transition region in 7m. Vieillardi is better
developed and the number of scale leaves much greater than in the other forms. Associated with this fact is the presence of a vascular supply in relation to many of these
scale leaves. The earliest (lowermost) traces are merely strands of thin-walled cells,
ending blindly in the cortex some distance below the leaf-base (text-fig. 3); higher up
definite tracheides are present, but the trace invariably stops short at the leaf-base,
never entering the free process. Only when we come to leaves with a definite lamina
do we find the bundle actually entering the free portion of the leaf, but it is noteworthy
that even then it never penetrates the apiculus.§

There has been some controversy|| as to whether the gaps in the stele of T’mesipteris
are to be looked upon as true foliar gaps or only as “ perforations ” having no relation
to leaf-traces. ‘The discussion has some importance as bearing on Prof.
