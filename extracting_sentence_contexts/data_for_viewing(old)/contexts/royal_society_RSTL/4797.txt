Ship of these tissues in the Ray to those of the higher mammals, this deficiency of the
higher osseous elements will be readily understood. Another important fact also to
be remembered is, that the small circular cells existing in _these bones and dermal
plates, are not the homologues of the canaliculated lacunz, known as the corpuscles

of Purkinar. The former exhibit none of the beautiful radiating lacunz which are
8 characteristic of the latter objects. It is true, we have frequently a small tubular
canal connecting two such cavities together, but these are very different from the
beautiful stellate objects seen in the bones of an eel or the scales of a Lepidosteus.
The fact is, that though analogous they are not homologous. They differ in their
s$tructure, and till more in their origin; and the neglect of these differences has con-
tributed, in no small degree, to produce the amount of obscurity and confusion that
has hitherto invested the history both of the corpuscles of PurKINIE and the genesis
of bone, an obscurity which Dr. SHareEy was the first to clear away.

Turning from the flat Plagiostomes to the Sharks, we find that their osseous struc- |
tures are essentially the same as amongst the Rays, though presenting numerous i
minor modifications, both in their modes of development and in the forms which I

their osseous centra ultimately assume.

The common Picked Dogfish (Spinaz acanthias, Cuv.) presents one of the simplest
