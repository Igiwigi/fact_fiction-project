excitation, as will be shown later.

Upon which of these sources does CO, exert its action, and of what nature is that
action ?

It is not probable that CO, has any action upon the inner surface, for as far as is
known CO, is without effect upon the electrical condition of connective tissue fibre.
Du Bots (18) has shown that short exposure of muscle to CO, has no appreciable
effect upon the demarcation current, an experiment that I have often repeated,
leading off from the tendon and belly of the gastrocnemius of the Frog, with con-
firmatory result. In this case, if the current is not affected, there is action upon
neither muscle nor tendon, the absence of action upon the former being probably
associated with the fact that the muscle tissue is, so to speak, habituated to the
presence of this gas. This is not, at any rate to like extent, the case with the
protoplasmic structures at the outer surface of the skin, and it is reasonable to
suppose that the action of CO, is almost exclusively upon this surface.

With the assumption that CO, acts principally, if not exclusively, upon the

structures of the epidermis, and that its action is, by lessening vital action, to cause
a diminution of the E.M.F. dependent upon such action, the facts arising out of
experiment became easily explicable.
