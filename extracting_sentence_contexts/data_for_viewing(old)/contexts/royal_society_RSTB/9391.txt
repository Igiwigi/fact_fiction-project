expressed GAL4 drives expression of the reporter with
the same cellular specificity, allowing one to visualize the
expression (figure 2).

Rather than relying on random transposon insertion, one
can logically select promoter regions from genes that are
known to be expressed in the cell type of interest, to drive
GAL4 with a similar cell-specificity. For example, the TH
gene encodes tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme that is required
for the synthesis of dopamine [35]. Consequently, a fragment
from the TH-promoter [36] directs gene expression in some
dopaminergic neurons (although this not always infallible; in
fact, the heavily employed TH-GAL4 does not label rewarding
dopaminergic neurons [37,38]). Similarly, a fragment from the
acetylcholine transporter drives gene expression in many
cholinergic neurons [39]. These two examples, however, pro-
vide expression control confined to most of the cells that use
dopamine or acetylcholine but not to defined subsets of this
cell type in a particular region of the brain. This is important
because it is clear that anatomically discrete neurons that use
the same transmitter have unique functions. This is exemplified
by fly dopaminergic neurons; those in the central complex
regulate arousal [40-42], whereas others innervating discrete
zones in the mushroom body lobes convey positive or nega-
tive reinforcement [21,37,38,43,44], or provide motivational/
