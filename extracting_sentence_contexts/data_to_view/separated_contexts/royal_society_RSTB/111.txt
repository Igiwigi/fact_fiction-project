Tscurrct also states that they
are commoner on the roots of plants growing in poor soil (as regards nitrogen) than
on those in rich humus-soils, a statement I fail to confirm. Darkness, drought, and
other disturbing influences of the kind hinder the proper development of the
tubercles ; and the rule is that the tubercles flourish in proportion to the thriving
of the plant. It is obvious, on a little reflection, that there would be nothing in these facts
which contradicts the explanation I have given. Since the gemmules stimulate the
protoplasm of the cells to greater activity—as indicated by the increased supplies of
starch and the hypertrophied growth—it is clear that the needs for the increased
activity will be satisfied only in proportion to the ability of the host-plant to furnish
supplies : darkness would cut off the supplies of carbo-hydrates, and drought those
of water and minerals, and thence the parasite and protoplasm in the tubercles suffer. This can be directly shown in water-cultures, as well as in the case of plants growing
in the open.
