Impressions in Clay-ironstone Nodules.â€”Speaking generally, plant remains are not
well distributed in the ironstones of South Staffordshire. A few examples are known
from the Gubbin ironstones, between the Heathen and Thick coals, and from some
others; but, with the exception of the Coseley ironstones, they appear to be decidedly
rare. The fact that very few ironstones are to-day worked in this coalfield may,
however, account in part for this seeming poverty. On the other hand, the Ten-foot Ironstones, above the Thick Coal at Claycroft,
near Coseley, have furnished one of the most remarkable plant assemblages known
from the Coal Measures. These specimens occur there in extraordinary abundance,
and during the many years when these beds were mined as an open work, the
supply of nodules was unlimited.
