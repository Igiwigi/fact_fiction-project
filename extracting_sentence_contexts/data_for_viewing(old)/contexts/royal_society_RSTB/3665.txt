(for the purpose of comparing the two industries) to the investigation of the stone
implements of the Tasmanians, having spent some months in Tasmania for this
purpose. I have during this winter (1912) been able, by Mr. WestiaKe’s kindness,
to examine a large part of his splendid collection, with the illustration and description
of which he is now busy. The age of the Aurillac chert implements is definitely
fixed by a lava-flow of ascertained Upper Miocene age, which overlies the deposit
containing them. The deposit contains teeth of Dinotherium giganteum, Hipparion
gracile, and Machairodus cultridens. The chert itself is derived from an anterior
Eocene deposit. I was impressed by the similarity of many of Mr. WestLakr’s
specimens to the worked tabular flints of Ightham (Kent plateau). The chert of
Aurillac occurs in tabular masses, larger and thicker than those of the flint made use
of at Ightham, and many of the “ worked” pieces are of relatively great size. But
the fact which I wish to announce here, in connection with my account of the
rostro-carinate implements of Suffolk (Icenian industry), is that in Mr. Westiake's
collection from Aurillac are three rostro-carinate implements, identical in character
of manufacture, of shape, and of size, with those of Suffolk. I am able to present
(text-figs. 44 and 45) rough line-drawings of the dorsal and ventral surfaces of one
of these implements, the specimen having been lent to me for the purpose by
Mr. Westiake. It seems to me not possible to doubt the close similarity of the
Aurillac chert implement and the Suffolk flint “eagle’s beaks.” Figs. 44 and 45
should be compared with figs. 8 and 9 and with figs. 10 and 11.

I do not intend to proceed without caution to any conclusion on this subject, but it
seems to me quite possible that there was a close relationship between the men who
made the Upper Miocene rostro-carinate implements of Aurillac and those who made
