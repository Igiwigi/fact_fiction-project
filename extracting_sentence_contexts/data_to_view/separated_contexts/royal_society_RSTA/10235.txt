This second rise in the curve has been shown by Professor ‘TowNsEND
(Phil. Mag.,’ 6th series, vol. 1, p. 198, 1901) to be due to the ionisation of the
molecules of the gas by the corpuscles themselves, and the potential gradient at
which it begins is inversely proportional to the pressure. The fact that the current-E.M.F. curves are not horizontal even when we should
expect saturation, and that they become steeper and steeper at their flattest parts as
the pressure is decreased, seems to indicate that there is ionisation by collision to
some extent at gradients much below those at which the second rise in the curve
leading up to the spark discharge commences. We have not as yet, however,
succeeded in obtaining a thoroughly satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon. According to Pascuen’s tables, quoted in Professor J.
