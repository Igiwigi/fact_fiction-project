Mr. E. HowarD on a new fulminating Mercury, 927

In addition to the other singular properties of the fulminating
mercury, it may be observed, that two ounces inflamed in the
open air, seem to produce a report much louder than when the
same quantity is- exploded in a gun capable of-resisting its
action. Mr. CRUIcKSHANK, who made some of the powder, by
my process, remarked that it would not inflame gunpowder.
In consequence of which, we spread a mixture of coarse and
fine grained gunpowder upon a parcel of the mercurial powder;
and, after the inflammation of the latter, we collected most, if
not all, of the grains of gunpowder. Can this extraordinary fact
be explained by the rapidity of the combustion of fulminating |
mercury? or is it to be supposed, (as gunpowder will not
explode at the temperature at which mercury is thrown into
vapour,) that sufficient caloric is not extricated during this
combustion ?

From the late opportunity I have had of conversing with
Mr. CRuIcK$HANK, I find that he has made many accurate
experiments on gunpowder; and he has permitted me to state,
« that the matter which remains after the explosion of gun-
« powder, consists of potash united with a small proportion of
*« carbonic acid, sulphate of potash, a very small quantity of
