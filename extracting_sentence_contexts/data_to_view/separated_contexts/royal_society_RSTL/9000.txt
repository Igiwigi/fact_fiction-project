Given, for instance, any ganglio-muscular
tisxue which is rhythmically contracting, and how are we to know whether the action

X of the ganglia is truly automatic, or sustained from time to time by stimuli proceeding
a from other parts of the organism ? In most cases experiments cannot be conducted with
S reference to this question, but in the case of the Meduse they may be 80; and it was
with the view of throwing light on this question that the experiments just described
= were made. Noy in these experiments the fact is sufficiently obvious that mutilations
= of any part of the organism modify the rhythm of the marginal ganglia most profoundly. S That this modification does not proceed from shock, would seem to be indicated
g by the facts that the first effect of the mutilation is to quicken the rhythm, that
s there is a sort of general proportion to be observed between the amount of tissue
2 abstracted and the degree of slowing of the rhythm produced, and that the slowing effects
= continue for 80 long a time.
