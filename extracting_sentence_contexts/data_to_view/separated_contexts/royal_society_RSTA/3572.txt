However, we do not discard it, because motility of
tumour cells has not been included in this first investigation, and might be crucial for these cells
to escape. Finally, even though the tumours here inspected are genetically homogeneous and no
evolutionary process is really taking place in our model, the transient bifurcation diagrams
insinuate how the sculpting of the phenotype occurs, moving from the first region to the second,
and then to the third. In fact, a similar CA can be used to explore the impact of heterogeneity
and how the process of immunoedition takes place. It suffices to consider that the immune cell
intrinsic cytotoxicity, represented by the parameter 6y,, depends on the tumour cell.

(b) Low recruitment scenario

We now evaluate the impact of the recruitment of immune cells to the domain of the tumour. For this purpose, we reduce the value of @;eÂ¢ from 1 to 0.35.
