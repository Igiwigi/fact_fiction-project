The conception of distortion alluded to in Sect. V. applies to (3.) in a very remark.
able manner; for if we put

d 4 d
Aa,+B8,+0v2,= Q',

Biiz+ByB+Byyt=r,
then Q' is N distorted by the line A.o+AB+Ayy; and v' is v distorted by the line
B.u+BB+Byy. In using the expression © distorted by,” I anticipate a signification
which I hope to explain in a future paper; but the fact is, Q' is a distributive function
of QN and Au+AGP+A,y (se art. 105), and therefore, symbolically, N' is N multi-
plied by Au+AB+Azy.

Now the equation (3.) becomes

T9 =Q(N.v)->(DR.)%
dt? bl
or, for transverse vibrations, simply
a= —(DQ. )*%.

But I must reserve the consideration of this remarkable equation, merely remark-
ing here that it shows very clearly how the force brought into play by the disarrange-
