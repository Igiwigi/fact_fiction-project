has tended to lessen this asymmetry, owing presumably to second differences only having
been taken into account, As definite features in Table A, it may be noted that graduation
has pushed forward the maximum from 1769 to 1770, has greatly lessened the difference
between the ordinates at 1778 and 1779, and has advanced the maximum again from
1787 to 1788, from 1870 to 1871, from 1905 to 1906, and from 1917 to 1918. If we take
two damped sine curves with the above respective values of 4, but, for fair comparison,
the same period—say, 11-164 years—the first with the greater damping factor would have
its first maximum at 2°15 years, the second with the lower damping factor at 2°44 years—
i.e., the maximum would be advanced by roundly 0-3 of a year. The graduation seems
to have had, unintentionally, the effect of producing an average advance of this order
of magnitude, and therefore of reducing the apparent damping.

The question whether in fact the damping factor represents a physical reality or merely
an attempt of the empirical formula to adjust itself to the asymmetry of the waves is
for the present postponed. In the first place, a more detailed examination of the
disturbances is desirable.

First let us examine more closely the apparent alternation of disturbed and quiet
periods, each some 40 to 42 years in duration, which was already noted in the graph of
the disturbances as calculated from the harmonic formula and is equally evident in the
present graphs. It is not possible to assign the beginnings and ends of such periods
with precision ; and, as it happens, doing the work independently, I did not take precisely
the same years for Wotrer’s and the graduated numbers. There is also a difficulty at
the commencement of the data. As I judge it, the magnitude of the disturbance in 1751
