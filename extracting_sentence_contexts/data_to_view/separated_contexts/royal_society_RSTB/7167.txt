There are,
evidently, specific differences in the susceptibility of the larvae to desiccation, X. cheopis
being slightly less and X. astia considerably more susceptible than X. brasiliensis. A very large amount of facts on the limits of temperature and humidity which are fatal to
the larvae of the three species is set out in table 4. The facts for these species are interpreted
in figures 1, 3 and 4. At the different temperatures tried, 40° R.H. was rapidly fatal to the
larvae of all the species; similarly, 45°, r.u. was fatal. Mellanby (1933, p. 198) also found
that the larvae of X. cheopis ‘died very soon’ at 40% R.u. or below and 18 to 35° C.
