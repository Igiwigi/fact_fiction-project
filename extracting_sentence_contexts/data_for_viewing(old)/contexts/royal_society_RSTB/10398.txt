the jawed vertebrates, the skeletal nodules, rods and plates of
fins engendered the stereotypical proximodistally increasing
array of elements of tetrapod limbs only when the earlier-
evolved skeletogenic activators came under the control of one
or another biogeneric reaction—diffusion mechanism.

2. ‘Liquid tissues’ and the first animals

Animal embryos attain multicellularity when cells that are
clonally derived from a zygote—a fertilized egg—remain
attached to one another by one or more members of the cad-
herin family of integral membrane proteins. (The name
‘cadherin’ reflects the fact that these proteins require sufficient
levels of extracellular calcium ions for them to serve as cell
adhesion molecules (CAMs) [12]). The cell-adhesive factors
that mediate cell aggregation in non-metazoan holozoans,
however, differ from those used by animal embryos.
Monosiga brevicollis and Salpingoeca rosetta, members of Choa-
noflagellata (the non-metazoan holozoans most closely
related to the animals), contain several genes that specify pro-
teins called protocadherins [13]. These proteins, which are
also found in metazoans, have cadherin-type extracellular
domains that mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion, but
they lack the cytoplasmic domains of other (‘classical’) cad-
herins [12], exclusive to metazoans, that link the cell surface
