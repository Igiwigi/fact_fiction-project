that ®-curves meet ®-quadrics in only one free point, that ® and ‘Y-surfaces have
always the same order, and that V-curves are always conics meeting Y~primals im only
one free pownt.

In any one of the transformations the general ©-surface, being the partial or complete
intersection of two quadrics, must belong to one of a small number of well known types.
These include the quadric surface, the ruled cubic surface, and some of the quartic
surfaces of intersection of two quadrics.

We set out now to show that given any possible ®-surface F, we can find all H-systems
of quadrics ® in which F is a general ®-surface.

Let F, in fact, be the partial or complete intersection of two quadrics Q;, Q. It will
clearly be sufficient, then, if we find all H-systems of quadrics which contain Q,, Qe,
and in which, also, F is a general ®-surface ; and this we now proceed to do.

The first step is to determine a certain system of quadrics ®,, where ©, is defined
as the most general linear system of quadrics, which contains Q,, Qe, and in which the
general variable surface of intersection is of the same type as ¥. Now there are only three
kinds of restriction that we can impose on a linear system of quadrics, which will affect
the type of the general surface of intersection and yet leave the system linear and of
freedom 7 => 4. First, we may make the quadrics contain a given plane or quadric
surface ; secondly, we may make them pass through a given point and touch a given
prime at the point ; and thirdly, we may make them touch a given plane along a given
line in the plane—in which case any two of the quadrics will touch at some two points
