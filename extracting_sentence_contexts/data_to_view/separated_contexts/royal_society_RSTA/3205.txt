On the other hand, it
is quite well motivated to consider that this bulk mass is dynamical and generated by coupling
the fermions to a bulk scalar field which in turn obtains a VEV. We can then expect a position-
dependent bulk mass as this VEV is generically not constant along the extra dimension. In
fact, the simplest mechanism for radion stabilization, due to Goldberger & Wise [36], consists
in introducing a bulk scalar field which obtains a VEV from potentials on the two branes. The
most minimal scenario to dynamically generate the bulk mass is then to use this bulk scalar. Interestingly, during the process of radion stabilisation, the profile of the Goldbergerâ€”Wise scalar
VEV changes.
