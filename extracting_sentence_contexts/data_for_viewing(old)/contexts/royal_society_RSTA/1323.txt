which is a quadratic program (QP) with linear constraints. There is plenty of literature available [s
to solve quadratic optimizations, [30]. In general, the matrix A = (4;;)(i;)<cxe is indefinite. Thus, .
we are facing the most complicated QP which might be potentially NP-hard, see [31].

However, our empirical applications show that standard algorithms provide a solution in

reasonable time. The reason is likely the very special structure of A which is a Euclidian distance
matrix (EDM) and is mainly studied in the context of Euclidean distance matrix completion
problems (EDMCP). Such a matrix has full rank if y; 4 y; for all i, j € c with i # j, [32]. Additionally,
[33] provides a proof that —A has exactly one negative eigenvalue. As our feasible region of the
QP is compact, we can apply quadratic programming theory (see [31]). It follows that there exists
a polynomial time algorithm for (3.11) that provides e-exact solutions. As —A has exactly one
negative eigenvalue, this polynomial time is in fact quadratic. However, to our knowledge, there
is no algorithm for QPs with EDMs available so far where this property has been proven. Still, it
is fair to assume that any reasonable algorithm available for solving (3.11) will benefit from the
aforementioned structure of the problem.

4. Applications

In this section, we show different applications for ensemble and scenario reduction using
the energy distance and the Wasserstein distance for comparison purposes. First, we study
ensemble and scenario reduction for a Bernoulli random walk which corresponds to a binary
tree. Afterwards, we consider scenario reduction for electricity load/demand/consumption and
electricity prices,” which are highly relevant in many energy systems applications. However, both
considered real data studies are mainly for illustration purposes. We do not apply the reduced
