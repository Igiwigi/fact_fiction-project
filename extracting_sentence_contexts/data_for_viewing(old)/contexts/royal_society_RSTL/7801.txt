MANY we started for it at mid-day on the 22nd. The sides of the hill on which it is
situate (an outlying buttress of the mountain already "mentioned) were of considerable
steepness, and channelled in many places by small streams, It was mainly composed of
sand and of shales, and was strewn with disintegrated fragments of hardened clays, sand-
stones, and basalt. The most prominent features were the dykes of trap which appeared
in numerous places; sometimes as regular in form as built walls, and in others as
picturesque as Rhine castles. Five, if not six, of these dykes appeared at different places
in the section of the coast between the headlands of Atanekerdluk and Immarsoit.

«It has been already mentioned that this locality had been frequently visited * before
1867 for the sake of its fosil deposit. This was evident by numerous fragments that
we found in the course of our ascent, which had been dropped by others in descending,
and it seemed at first as if the deposit was very extensive. We found it in fact to be
confined within narrow limits. It did not appear to extend a greater length than 400
feet, with a maximum depth of 150 feet. In most places the portion exposed was
nothing mor? than a seam a few feet in depth. It was on a shelf of the hill at the
height of 1175 feet; the southern end was exposed on the north side of the most pro-
minent of the ravines already referred to. The length of the deposit, that is to say the
face of the hill on which it was found, fronted the Waigat, due west (magnetic).

«I took from England, besides hammers, picks, and shovels, all the necessaries for
blasting; but these latter were unnecessary. The seam was for the most part enclosed
by sand, and specimens were obtained with ease. After a hard day's work we returned
to our camp, in a ruined native house by the shore. It froze sharply during the
night.
