The redistribution and recycling of herbivore dung is an
important ecological function performed by widely distribu-
ted groups of soil macrofauna, including earthworms and
dung beetles. These act as keystone species in grazed and
browsed. ecosystems through their contribution to carbon
and nutrient cycling, secondary seed dispersal, and mainten-
ance of hotspots of microbial diversity and plant growth
[100-102]. Dung beetles decline when large mammals
become locally extinct [22], and in fact, some species disap-
peared with the late Quaternary megafauna extinctions
[103]. Declines and losses of coprophagous invertebrates
should be taken into account when predicting the impact of
rewilding, for instance, whether a habitat has a functionally
efficient community of dung recyclers. The observation of
niche segregation among dung beetle species based on
dung type [104] suggests that the disappearance of certain
species may leave a functional gap in the community.
