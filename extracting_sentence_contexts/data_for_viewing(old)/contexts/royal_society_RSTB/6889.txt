Some of this elongation is accounted for by the forcible opening out of the 14 coils
known to be there; the length that this would produce is indicated by ink lines. The
additional extension, which is considerable (i.e. at least 115°, see Appendix II),
must clearly have resulted from a deformation of some other type. The nature of this
deformation cannot be directly observed, since it is certainly below the limit of
visibility, but two alternatives suggest themselves. Molecular slipping may have
occurred, in which case a chromosome so treated will have been rather fundamentally

* Recent cytological literature on this subject has shown so much preoccupation with chiasmata
and chromosome splitting that this simple consideration of chromosome length has been largely lost
sight of. “The chromosomes continue to lengthen during pachytene, reaching their maximum at the
end of this stage when they divide” is a typical modern quotation (Darlington 1935, p. 89) yet no
significant basis of new facts seems to underlie such a change of view. For further consideration of this
see pp. 205-6 below.

disorganized internally, or (and the magnitude of the extension makes this inherently
probable from the start) the stretching has opened out some inner convolution with
elastic properties of the same order as those of the visible spiral. That this is the case
appears to be demonstrated by the observable reactions of chromosomes when
deformed by each other.
