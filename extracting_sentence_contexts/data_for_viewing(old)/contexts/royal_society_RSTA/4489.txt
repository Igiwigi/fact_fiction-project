The idea for an experimental psychological paradigm is that instructions involving the 22
outcomes in an outcome set Y is given to a subject who is asked to choose one of Y’s outcomes. : 8
The identity of the subject and the chosen outcome are recorded as data. Other subjects are given : S
the same instructions and the same outcome set Y and their identities and outcome choices : fea)
are recorded as data. For convenience, this experimental process is called an experiment and is :s

identified with its outcome set. Thus, in this case, the experiment is also called Y. By linking
together the data from the various experiments in the paradigm P with known and hypothesized
theory, the psychological scientist is able to draw conclusions about the subjects’ psychological
behaviour.

P’s experimental outcome sets are pairwise disjoint. This is to reflect the fact that they appear
in different experiments. A main idea behind the treatments of paradigms presented in this
section is that experiments act like ‘contexts’, and thus are able to change the meaning of an
outcome to a subject by instructions, by other choices in its outcome set, etc. Of course, there are
situations where one wants to identify certain outcomes across experiments, and a mechanism
for doing this is presented later.

Throughout this section, S is a non-empty set. It is called the set of subjects for P. A between-
subject paradigm based on P with the set of subjects S is where each subject s in S participates in
exactly one experiment Y in P. In that experiment, the subject is required to pick one and only
one of the outcomes in the experiment’s outcome set Y. A within-subject paradigm is defined later.

Note that in a between-subject experiment, each subject has a (theoretical) choice for an outcome in each
