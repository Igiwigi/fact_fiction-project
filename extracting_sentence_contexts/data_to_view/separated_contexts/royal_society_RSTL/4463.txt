In the one case
we have the chemical diyision of the element, in the other the chemical synthesis to
explain: and to give a philosophical account of either fact we must assume alike the
existence of a chemical difference between its particles. Now, when we snbstitute
peroxide of barium for baryta in the iodine experiment, this very intercalation of the
oxygen has been effected, and the conditions of the change been fulfilled, the polar
cycle being completed, thus :—

In fact, when water is poured upon a mixture of peroxide of barium and iodine, a
violent evolution of gas occurs, and the same when chlorine is led into water con-
taining the peroxide, or when the peroxide is thrown into a solution of hypochlorite
of lime in acetic acid. This experiment with iodine is 80 important, that I shall give at full length the de-
terminations of the quantity of gas evolved in this reaction. The experiment was
made in the small bulb-apparatus already described, p. 779.
