The probability that this difference is due to errors of random sampling
is about 50%, so that there is no reason to suppose that the torsional rigidity changes when
partial yield in bending has occurred. If in fact there is a change, it may be concluded to be
extremely small. Presuming therefore that all the eight measurements of the torsional rigidity are expected
to be the same, it is possible to consider whether the experimental technique was satisfactory
by examining whether these eight values show a greater degree of scatter about their general
mean than would be expected from the fact that each value has a standard deviation of
0-0076 x 10°. The standard error of the deviations of these eight measurements from their
general mean, obtained by summing the squares of the deviations, may be estimated as
0-010 x 10°, and although this exceeds 0-0076 x 10° the usual test of significance (Fisher
1941) shows that such a difference is well within the limits of reasonable expectation. It
may therefore be concluded that there is no reason to suspect any flaws in the experimental
technique and method of correcting the results which might cause greater random variations
from test to test than would be expected from the standard error attributable to each observa-
tion of the torsional rigidity.

(ii) Tests on a bar of circular cross-section

The tests on the bar of circular cross-section, }in. diameter, were carried out using similar
apparatus.
