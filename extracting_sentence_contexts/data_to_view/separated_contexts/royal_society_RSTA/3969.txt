This reduced the sample to 271 individual full postcodes. (The accompanying publication by
Barnard et al. [7], which assessed the performance of data collected by CS volunteers, presents
greater numbers, as full postcodes were not needed to validate their data entries.) We discarded.
partial postcodes, because we could not match them with schools or non-schools postcodes as we
categorize data for further analysis. The geographical distribution of the individual postcodes can be found in figure 2a, where they
are divided into two groups, schools and non-schools, which is a distinction developed further
in this paper. In table 2, we subdivided postcodes by region to highlight the fact that the schools
that participated were not evenly distributed across the country. We found a higher concentration
of schools postcodes from the South East (68 out of 127), followed by Scotland (39 out of 127). By
contrast, we found fewer schools postcodes from Northern Ireland (2 out of 127) and Wales (6 out
of 127).
