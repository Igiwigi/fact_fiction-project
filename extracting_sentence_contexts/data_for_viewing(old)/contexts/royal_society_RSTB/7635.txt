¥(0) = 3H, ei? (¥(0) being values of Y at = 0),

then the required initial conditions are satisfied provided A,+B, = G, and C,+D, = H,.
Values A,, B,, C,, D, to satisfy these conditions can be found unless p, = f;. This is an excep-
tional case and its solution if required may be found as the limit of the normal case.

8. TyPEs OF ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOUR IN THE RING AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME

As the reader was reminded in § 2, after a lapse of time the behaviour of an expression of
the form of (6-11) is eventually dominated by the terms for which the corresponding p, has
the largest real part. There may, however, be several terms for which this real part has the
same value, and these terms will together dominate the situation, the other terms being
ignored by comparison. There will, in fact, normally be either two or four such ‘leading’
terms. For if p,, is one of them then py_,, = f,,, since

sin? (4) = sin’?

so that p,, and py_,, are roots of the same equation (6-8). If also p,, is complex then
Rp,, = Ap.) and so in all
Rp, res Rp, = Rpy-sy = BPs

One need not, however, normally anticipate that any further terms will have to be included.
If p,, and p,, are to have the same real part, then, unless 5, = 59 or 5) +5, = N the quantities
a, b,c, d, 1, v Will be restricted to satisfy some special condition, which they would be unlikely
to satisfy by chance. It is possible to find circumstances in which as many as ten terms have
