The velocity of the black cloud is different in different parts of its course. So far
as our observations go it is comparatively low at first, and increases as it sweeps
down the hill till it is probably at a maximum just before it reaches the plains
beneath, or the sea. Then it again diminishes, and rapidly slows down, as is well
seen in St. Vincent by its effects on the trees. We have compared its violence to
that of a hurricane or tornado, but in many ways the comparison does not hold good.
For equal velocities the destructive effects of the dust cloud must have been con-
siderably greater than that of any wind, for the weight of the mass, or rather its
momentum, is high, owing to the density of the mixture of gases and of dust. This
is much heavier than air, and flows along the ground, but lighter than water, on
which it always floats.

There are a few facts which seem to show that the mere weight of the cloud did
much damage, as, for example, that the hatches of the “ Roraima” were stove in.t
We looked in St. Vincent for similar effects, but found none, even on Lot 14, which
was nearest the crater. The roofs had in some cases collapsed, probably with the
weight of ashes which gathered through the night. Many windows were broken,
apparently by falling stones, as in Georgetown. There-was no evidence that a great
aerial shock, such as follows an explosion or the discharge of large guns, had broken
the windows, though, as it was about mid-day, they were probably open, and may
have escaped in consequence.

Professor Lacrorx and his colleagues { consider that the blast which destroyed
St. Pierre covered a distance of 8 kilometres in three minutes. No very good
evidence is available on which to base exact estimates. When the blast passed
