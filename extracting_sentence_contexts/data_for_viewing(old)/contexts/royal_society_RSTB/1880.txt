The @ priori conceivable list of possible varieties of response (omitting as of
uncertain determination cases of zero after-deflection) is now complete, with one
significant exception, which is indicated in parentheses, and has never come under my
observation.

Of the above list, the first four members include the types of response that have
most frequently come under my observation; they form a sequence, in so far as two
or more members may always be observed to follow each other in the order named,
from 1 to 4, and may always be made to follow each other backwards from 4 to 1 by
the chief disintegration product CO, (A) externally applied to the nerve, and (B)
presumably evolved from within the nerve itself during a prolonged tetanisation.
This reversal of sequence bas, in fact, been fully described in Chapter III., where the
sequence itself, now to be considered, was unavoidably stated in dogmatic form in
preface to a detailed description of its reversal by CO,. It may, however, be
mentioned that a similar reversal is effected by various other meansâ€”by formie and
lactic acids, e.g., and by a renewed transverse section.

The fifth member of the list, viz., a positive deflection followed by a negative after
deflection, N.S., was far less frequently and assuredly observed, and I do not know
whether, in order of development, it should be placed before or after the response
N.N. The after-effect 8. is, in this case, never very pronounced, so that, in view of
the uncertainty of instrumental correction considered in the head-note to Table D,
it may have been present in slight degree more often than it was obviously present.
