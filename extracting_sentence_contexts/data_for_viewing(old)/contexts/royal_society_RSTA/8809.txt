the conclusion that the negative results obtained in the attempts to convert graphite
into diamond by electrical heating are not due to lack of temperature; on the other
hand, the presence of minute crystals in the molten layer of the steel of the end of
the barrel subjected to high, gaseous pressures of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
and hydrogen appears to be connected with the other experiments bearing upon the
inclusion of gases in metal as a factor in the production of diamond.

The experiment of firing a high velocity steel bullet with cupped nose through
vaporizing carbon into a hole in a block of steel has tested the effect of a momentary
pressure of about 300,000 atmospheres on carbon initially near its melting-point, and
probably raised by adiabatic compression by another 1000Â° C.

The fact that only a very few minute crystals resembling diamond were produced
(probably from the iron) raises the question as to whether the duration of the
pressure is sufficient to start a transformation of graphite to diamond which can be
detected by analysis. We have distinct evidence that, with iron as the matrix, the
time is sufficient to form very small crystals which can be identified with some
certainty, so it therefore seems reasonable to conclude that there was no incipient
transformation in bulk, and that however long the pressure of 300,000 atmospheres
were applied, it is extremely doubtful if any change would occur.

The pressure of 300,000 atmospheres is between one quarter to one half that
obtaining at the centre of the Earth, but vastly greater pressures exist at the centre
of the larger stars, and are produced by the collision of large bodies in space; these
pressures are many thousands of times greater, and whether they would effect the
