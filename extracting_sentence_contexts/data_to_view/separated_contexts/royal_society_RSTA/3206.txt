This mechanism can be relevant for CP violation for all quarks and enables a large
variation of the Yukawa couplings, from values of order 1 to today’s small values of the light
quarks. A particularly interesting spin-off in this construction is that modified fermion wave functions
give suppression of CP-violating processes which are on the other hand very constraining in usual
RS. In fact, the overlap between the wave functions of the KK gluon and the light fermions is now
reduced in the vicinity of the IR brane, while remaining the same on the IR brane itself—where the
Higgs is localized—in order to lead to the same four-dimensional Yukawas. The decreased overall
overlap causes the four-dimensional effective coupling of light quarks to KK gluons to become
suppressed, which eases constraints in K — K mixing as illustrated in figure 6. The resulting bound
on the KK scale is weakened by a factor of 3, significantly ameliorating the little hierarchy problem
in RS [3].
