There was thus a high
mortality combined with a considerable reduction in size. As noted previously, there is a positive correlation between mortality and the density of
the population, the numbers of deaths increasing in geometrical progression as the number
of larvae per gram of meat is increased. This behaviour of mortality accounts, in a large
measure, for the fact that, in order to obtain a maximum production of larvae by weight,
there must be an inordinately high initial:larval population. In the case just quoted,
although the expected production from 1 g. of meat is 16-8 larvae, it requires nearly three
times this number in the original population to achieve this result. Larvae tend to congregate in more or less large, densely packed groups under the meat.
