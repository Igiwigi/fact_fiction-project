The close agreement between theory and observation is evidence that the
assumptions made in the theory are correct. In particular the eddy motion does not
diminish much in the first 900 metres.

We have seen that

BH, = Fe +a.

Tf, therefore, we can measure « and H, we can calculate B. The commonest value
for a on land is 20 degrees, in fact, for all except light winds, it is near to 20 degrees.
In the kite ascents on the “Scotia” the wind usually veered two points (224 degrees)
in the first 100 or 200 metres and after that remained constant in direction at greater
heights. It appears, therefore, that on the sea also « is about 20 degrees. Assuming
then that « = 20 degrees, we see from Table IIT. that BH, = 2°7.

Substituting for B its value

“
we find the following relation between H, and the eddy viscosity
