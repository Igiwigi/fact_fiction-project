The small volume changes actually measured were used to calculate and y and v, and
the points so obtained are marked in fig. 10. It will be seen that in the case of glass,
von Mises’ second hypothesis y. = v is fulfilled, the small deviation of the observed points
from the straight line » = v being due partly to experimental error and partly to the
fact that the thickness of the wall is not quite negligible. This indicates not only that
heated glass does behave like a viscous fluid in regard to its distortion, but also that
the method of measuring » and v by observing changes in internal volume of a tube
under combined extension and twisting is susceptible of considerable accuracy. Experiments with Lead and Cadmium.
