1t is from this thin layer of cells that the gelatinous connective tissue, the spicules, and
canal networks are formed. This special layer does not exist in other corals nor in
Cerianthus. The close resemblance in the histological structure of the coralla formed by animals
80 different as Alcyonaria (Zeliopora cerulea), Zoantharia, and Hydroida is a remarkable
fact. The corallum of 1illepors is distinguished from all other coralla by the presence
within it of systems of canals branching in an arborescent manner. The presence of
8uch structures in fossil corals will be sufficient evidence of the affinities of such corals
with Millepora and the Hydroida.
