In the present case two alternative sets of lines for the
8; series, one with »,= 309 and the other with »= 341 appear. In the original
search the former was taken because it is reproduced in the D series as well. But
later certain difficulties in the determination of the oun, combined with the fact that
the corresponding oun multiple in A,, although quite definite, is out of step with the
march of their values in the other gases, led me to include the second. This gives
a multiple quite in step with the others, and also affords the means of obtaining
a good approximation to the oun,

The lines are given in the following table, which also embrace a few obtained by
sounding, both wave-lengths and wave-numbers are given :—
