In mixing muriatic acid gas with carbonic acid, or oxygene,
or hydrogene, the gases being in their common states, as to:
moisture, there was always a cloudiness produced; doubtless:
owing to the attraction of their water to form liquid muriatic
acid.

On fluoric acid gas no such effect was occasioned. This fact,
at first view, might be supposed to shew, that the hydrogene
evolved by the action of potassium upon. fluoric acid gas, is

+ These facts and the other facts of the same kind, explain the difficulty of the
decomposition of the metallic muriates in common processes of metallurgy. 'They
likewise explain other phenomena in the agencies of muriaric salts. In all cases
when a muriatic salt is decomposed by an acid, ard muriatic acid gas set free, there
appears to be a double affinity, that of the acid for the basis, and of the muriatic acid

for water ; pure muriatic acid does not sxem capable of being displaced by any other
acid,
