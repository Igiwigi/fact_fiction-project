sation of those rays, but in a higher proportion ; and, that it -
depends much on their direction, being greater, as the angle is
greater at which they meet at the focus of the lens.

That fact is certainly very remarkable, It has often been the
subject of my meditations ; and it has contributed not a little to
the opinion I have been induced to adopt, respecting the nature of
light and of heat. I never could reconcile it with the supposi-
tion that heat is caused by the accumulation of any thing emitted

radiations.

ResERvinG for a future communication, an account of the
sequel of my enquiries respecting the subject which I have un-
dertaken to investigate, I shall conclude this long Paper with
some obseryations, concerning the practical uses that may be
derived from a knowledge of the facts which have been esta-
