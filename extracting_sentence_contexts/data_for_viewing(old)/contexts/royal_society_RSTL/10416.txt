Z $ 4. Changes of external form and further histological differentiation.

At the elose of segmentation the embryo is roughly spherical in form, varying
-2eonsiderably in outline. As development proceeds the body elongates slightly 80 that
EE) longer axis (antero-posterior) can usually be made out, but the larve both of Renilla
Sand Leptogorgia assume the most irregular and strange forms (figs. 100", 100%, 100#,
Â£107). Occasionally a larva develops very regularly, preserving a nearly even oval out-
Aine until the cilia make their appearance. But in far the greater number large irre-
= 9g prominences and depressions make their appearance over the whole surface of the
Zombryo, and the form becomes 80 strangely modified that it is difficult to believe the
_phrunken and distorted larye capable of further development, In fact I unhesitatingly
Seconsidered them at firs as abnormal or dying specimens, No two of them have the
Same form, and they sometimes appear almost like huge Amabe with short rounded
Zpseudopodia extended in various directions. Nevertheless the larva are perfectly
ormal, as I repeatedly proved by isolating them in small vessels and following their
development, A regular oval form is once more gradually assumed (fig. 101), and
most of the larva of twenty-four hours show no trace of the strange changes of form
through which they have passed. The various prominences and processes are not
capable of active movement, and the change of form is exceedingly slow. T am
entirely unable to say what the 8ignificance of this curious change of form may be,
and can hardly find a parallel to it in the development of other animals.
The rate of development varies exceedingly in different individuals, being sometimes
twice as rapid as in other cages. In nearly all instances, however, the embryo acquires
