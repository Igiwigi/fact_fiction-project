Scuwarzscui~p showed that the
observed relative decrease in intensity in the H and K lines was more compatible with the
constant ratio of line to background demanded by the scattering theory than with the
limb-vanishing demanded by the absorption theory, of which there is little trace. He
concluded that “ it is probable that the scattering of light plays an important réle in the
phenomena of the solar atmosphere.” Possibly a more detailed discussion of the
processes of absorption, especially taking into account the fact that Fraunhofer
lines appear to have their origins located at different levels, would modify this
conclusion ; it is, however, beyond the scope of the present paper to consider the question
of absorption lines. ScuwarzscHitp confined himself to adjacent portions of the spectrum, where the
wave-length was practically the same but the absorption coefficient assumed different. But there seems no reason why exactly the same reasoning should not be applied to
widely separated portions of the spectrum, where the coefficients of scattering are
different in virtue of the wave-lengths being different.
