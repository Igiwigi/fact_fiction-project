epibranchial artery which forms the tributary from the corresponding gill pouch to
the aorta.

The epibranchial vessels were in every instance relatively very small and differed
strikingly both in size and appearance from those of any other species of shark examined.
The arteries forming the efferent loops and their connectives are in appearance normal
vessels, with large lumen and walls of relatively little thickness, but no sooner does the
vessel leave the loop as the epibranchial, than its character completely changes. The
walls thicken, the lumen is reduced to minute proportions, and in general appearance
the vessel resembles a fibrous cord, similar to the ductus arteriosus of Mammals or any
other atrophied vessel.

There is in fact no doubt that the changes apparent in these vessels are of an atrophic
nature. Microscopical examination (Plate 9, fig. 3) shows that the lumen is more or
less irregular. The elastica interna lies close beneath the endothelium, but is weak,
much broken up, and irregular ; the media forms the bulk of the wall and consists of a
mixture of muscle and fibrous tissue felted together, with the individual fibres and fibre
bundles running in all directions, but assuming towards its outer parts a preponderantly
circular direction, with the addition close to the adventitia of a number of longitudinal
muscle bundles isolated by septa of fibrous tissue. Elastic tissue is poorly developed,
and in addition to the elastica interna is represented by a slight and irregular network
in the outer parts of the media and in the adventitia.

The mode of reduction shown by these arteries apparently differs in character from
that observed in other cases of physiological occlusion. In the ductus arteriosus
