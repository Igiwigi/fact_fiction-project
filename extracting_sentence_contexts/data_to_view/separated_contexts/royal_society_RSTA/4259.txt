All the artificial harmonic waves are absorbed to the shape function. This enables us to
obtain a sparse representation of the signal. Once the phase function is obtained, by exploring the fact that s is a periodic function of 6, we
can identify certain low-rank structure of the signal. This structure enables us to extract the shape
function from the signal. The details will be given in the next section.
