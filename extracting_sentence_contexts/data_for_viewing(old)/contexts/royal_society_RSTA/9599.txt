of the approximate methods which have been developed in §§13-17, before we proceed
to apply these in cases which have not hitherto been treated on the basis of our governing
equation (16).

Combining in proportions fixed by (54) the distributions of vorticity which have been
given in figs. 2-6, we could deduce the actual distribution which our solution implies, and
from this proceed to determine the corresponding stream function. The labour involved
would be considerable, and very little additional information would result. What is
more important is to examine the conditions which our solution implies at the surface
of the plate.

Our boundary condition (49) requires that wv, shall have the value unity at all points
on the plate ; if in fact the solution makes u, equal to (1 + e) at any point (< being
a quantity which varies with «), it is inaccurate to the extent that at this point it
implies a velocity (of the fluid relative to the plate) which is given by — <U, and
accordingly is up-stream when ¢ is positive.* Fig. 8 shows the variation of 1, as
