thoroughly, together with what we believe we are the first to recognize as a new
variety of monoclinic sulphur, as well as several mixtures of this variety with
amorphous sulphur obtained by cooling rapidly from a high temperature. The
permanence of monoclinic sulphur we find to be much greater than is generally
supposed, at least, if the melting point may be taken as a criterion,* while as for
octahedral sulphur, the only possible means at our disposal for obtaining it pure—
viz., by the method of Gernez—has hitherto failed in our hands. This method is
based on the obtaining of sulphur in a state of “surfusion.” The sulphur, which
is perfectly crystalline to begin with, is melted below 130° C., cooled to, say, 101° C.,
and then caused to crystallize in the octahedral form by sprinkling the sulphur with
a trace of the dust of octahedral crystals. ‘This appears to be a matter of some
delicacy, and in the course of a good many trials we have not succeeded to our
satisfaction, even when following M. Gernez’s instructions most minutely. The fact
is, that, melted sulphur has a very strong tendency to crystallize in the monoclinic
form, and this tendency can only be overcome under the most favourable circumstances
(if at all) and by the exercise of great care. For most electrical experiments, however,
it is necessary to obtain a film of the material between two conducting plates
which serve as electrodes, and the conditions attending the production of such films
are experimentally unfavourable to forced octahedral crystallization. Again, both
Fousserrau (‘C.R.’ 97, p. 996) and Borrzmann, Romicu and Faspiea, and Nowak
(‘ Sitzungsber. der Wiener Akad.,’ vols. 68 and 70) found no appreciable conductivity
in crystals of octahedral sulphur, though their methods were not very searching.

* The phenomena attending the transformation of monoclinic into octahedral sulphur will be dealt
with during the discussion of special cases.
