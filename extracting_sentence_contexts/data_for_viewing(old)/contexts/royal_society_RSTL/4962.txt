of three days the embryos of set H were advanced to the stage at which the lamine

dorsales are proceeding rapidly to meet, and form the median dorsal sulcus of the
growing body. But the corresponding ova in set I had not been carried further than
to the earliest perceptible indications of the area germinativa.

These facts sufficiently prove the great influence of temperature on the develop-
ment of the embryo in its earliest stages, as the comparative numerical results do
also its effects on the impregnation of the ovyum. Out of eighteen ova placed in
the higher and increasing temperature, thirteen produced embryos at nearly similar
stages of growth ; while of nineteen ova maintained in a low and diminishing tempe-
rature only eight became segmented, and but three of them arrived at the tadpole
state.

A somewhat similar but more marked result took place with the ova of No. 2 in
the two sets of experiments. The impregnating means employed in these trials had
already been forty minutes mixed with water on the filter. Out of forty-eight ova
employed in set H, twenty-five became segmented, and ten of these produced young.
But in et I fifty-one ova gave birth to only two embryos.
