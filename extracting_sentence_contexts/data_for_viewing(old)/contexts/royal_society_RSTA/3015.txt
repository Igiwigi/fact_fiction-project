Hence n < O(1/N?). Following an almost identical approach to (D2), (D3) and (D5), one can also

show that

where in the last line, we have used the fact that the dimension of the system space is /D + 1,
and that we can choose H such that its maximum eigenvalue is 7. Combining this result with the
result for n, we obtain

for sufficiently large N. Thus using the inductive argument in appendix C gives
