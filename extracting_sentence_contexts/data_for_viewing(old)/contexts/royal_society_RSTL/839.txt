attention. It is true that it is taken from among the gases, But,
if we suppose that we have attained accuracy in experiments
upon these subjects, I see no reason to refuse their evidence in
this instance. The density of oxygen gas, to that of water, is as
1 to 740; and the density of hydrogen gas as 1 to 9792. The
mean density of that proportion of oxygen and hydrogen gases
which constitutes water, is to that of water as 1 to 2098; or,
in other words, water is 2098 times heavier than the mean den-
sity of its elements in the gaseous state. But water is only
1200 times heavier than steam, or water in the state of vapour.
Therefore, there is a variation in +, of 898, or nearly half, be-
tween the density of water and its elements, when both are in the
aeriform state. This fact, however, regards bodies only as they
remain in the same $tate, whether of solidity, liquidity, or fluidity.
The anomaly is much greater, if we contemplate them as they
pass from one of these states to the other. Yet we must not
omit the consideration of such a change, in the instance of
mercury alloyed with platina; for the former metal, before liquid,
becomes 5olid as it enters into the new combination.

A stronger prejudice will perhaps exist against the fixation of
80 volatile a substance as mercury. It is certain that the labours
of the alchemists have thrown some ridicule upon this subject,
as a philosophical pursuit. Men of science have long since de-
clined the research ; and it is not probable that we are indebted
