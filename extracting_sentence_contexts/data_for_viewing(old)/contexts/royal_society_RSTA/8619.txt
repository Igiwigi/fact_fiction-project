is the stability curve when R, = 3-55, the extreme measurements have been left out
in order that the curve might be drawn on a scale large enough to give an idea of the
accuracy of the results.

A noticeable feature of the results is the way in which the curves, figs. 17 and 18,
approach asymptotically the lines Q,/Q, = R,?/R,. These lines are marked as dotted
straight lines. The prediction of the late Lord RayeiGu that an inviscid fluid contained
between two concentric cylinders would be stable if 2,/Q, > R,?/R.? is therefore true,
and is applicable to viscous liquids.

The conclusion deduced from his theory that an inviscid liquid would_be unstable
if the cylinders rotated in opposite directions is not applicable to viscous fluids. In
fact it is a remarkable feature of the curves that if the outer cylinder is rotating in the
opposite direction to the inner one, the speed which it is necessary for the inner cylinder
to attain in order that instability may arise is greater than it would be if the outer

cylinder were at rest.

Spiral Form of Instability.

In many cases a spiral form of instability was observed. In cases when the space
between the cylinders was small compared with the radius, this form was very similar
to the symmetrical type, except that each vortex in its square-sectioned partition was
wrapped as a spiral round the inner cylinder. In this way a double-threaded screw or
spiral was formed, the two “ threads ” being vortices in the cross-sections of which the
