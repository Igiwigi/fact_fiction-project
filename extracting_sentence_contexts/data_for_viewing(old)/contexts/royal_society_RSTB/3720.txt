They are readily recognisable on account of their large and almost spherical nuclei,
and the conspicuous shrinkage cavity by which they are usually surrounded.


270 PROF. A. DENDY ON THE STRUCTURE, ETC., OF THE PINEAL ORGANS AND

The amount of cytoplasm in proportion to the size of the nucleus is very small,
and it appears to be drawn out into one thick process which extends into
the layer of nerve-fibres, as shown in fig. 17. To what extent other
processes may be present, but cut off in the sections, I am unable to say. The
cytoplasm is finely granular. The nucleus has a very distinct membrane, numerous
minute chromatin granules scattered in the nuclear reticulum, and in the best
preserved sections a sharply defined nucleolus (fig. 17). In fact, the structure of
the nucleus is closely similar in all three categories of cells of which the retina
is composed.

The nerve-fibres are closely interwoven with one another to form a “ molecular ”
layer (fig. 4, ete., 7. nm. f. e.), connected with the nerve itself at a single point at the
back of the retina (fig. 3). Histologically, this layer differs from the nerve itself
only in the entire absence of the elongated nuclei which occur in the latter, and
which doubtless belong to supporting or nutrient connective-tissue cells.

(e) The Pigment and its Origin—The amount of pigment present in the adult
pineal eye is very large and it is practically confined to the retina, where it occurs
chiefly in the inner portion, between the sense-cells, but also, to a varying extent,
