It is rather as if the whole effect were modulated by a factor which passed through zero and
changed sign every few degrees. This complicated behaviour made the precise magnetic
determination of the orientation of the tetrad axis rather difficult, since the de Haas-van
Alphen amplitude vanished for several directions of the field within the possible uncer-
tainty of the direction of the tetrad axis as determined by the optical method. In each
series of measurements it was in fact necessary to measure a rotation curve such as that of
figure 16 and choose the origin of y in such a way that the curve for negative y was the
image of the curve for positive y after reflexion in both the axes of ordinates and abscissae. Within the small region where the couple increases linearly with 7 the curves of C/H?
against 1/H have the usual sinusoidal form, but at larger angles complicated modulations
