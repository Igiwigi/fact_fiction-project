These nonlinear interactions, governed by the | |
form of the nonlinear terms in (2.1), determine the phase and amplitude relationships among

these five relevant Fourier modes. For example, for the particular problem described in §2a, 1a
the nonlinearly generated Alfvén waves ke are phase-shifted from the primary Alfvén waves : 5
ke by 90° [17,58]. In fact, recent analytical and numerical work argues for the importance of Ss
intermittency, or phase synchronization, in weak incompressible MHD turbulence [144]. : 3

As the initial Alfvén wave amplitudes z+ increase to the strongly nonlinear regime, x —> 1, the :3
asymptotic expansion of the equations of evolution ceases to be well ordered, and higher order : =

terms—terms that can safely be neglected in the weakly nonlinear limit—begin to contribute
significantly. The nonlinear interactions associated with these higher order terms mediate

significant energy transfer to additional Fourier modes in the perpendicular plane, as depicted in : &
figure 1. Yet, even in the strong turbulence limit, the phase and amplitude relationships among all : 2
of these modes remain completely specified by the nonlinear terms in the equations of evolution. =

Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations using the Astrophysical Gyrokinetics Code, Ast roGK [145], : yy

evolution of an Alfvén wave collision in the strong turbulence limit, x ~ 1 [20].
