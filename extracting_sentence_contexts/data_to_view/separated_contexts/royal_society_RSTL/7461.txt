V. VANADIUM OXYCHLORTDES.

1. Vanadinm Oxytrichloride, or Vanadyl Trichloride, V O Cl,, molec. weight 17367
(terchloride of vanadium of Brrzrius).—The fact that the lemon-yellow-coloured liquid
chloride of vanadium prepared by the action of chlorine upon the trioxide does contain
oxygen, contrary to the distinct statements of previous experimenters, was ascertained in
various ways —

(1) A few grammes of the lemon-coloured liquid chloride was placed in a bulb
attached to a long combustion-tube half filled with pure sugar-charcoal and half with
metallic copper. A current of dry hydrogen, purified from oxygen according to the
method previously described, was then passed over the bulb and cold tube until every
trace of air was expelled; the carbon and copper were then heated to redness, and as
800n as the escaping gases had ceased for fifteen minutes to render baryta-water turbid,
Liebig's bulbs containing clear baryta-water were attached. The bulb containing the
oxychloride, which up to this point had been kept cool, was now warmed, and the
chloride distilled into the heated carbon in the tube; as 800n as the vapour of the

chloride was carried forward by the hydrogen, a dense precipitate of barium carbonate,
which effervesced on the addition of hydrochloric acid, was thrown down in the Liebig's
bulbs, proving that the liquid contains oxygen and undergoes partial decomposition when
mixed with hydrogen and brought in contact with red-hot charcoal.
