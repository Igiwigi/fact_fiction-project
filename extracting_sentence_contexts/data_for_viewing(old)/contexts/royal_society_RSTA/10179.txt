in the absence of other disturbing factors, depend on (1) the actual rate of combination
at the surface; (2) the rates at which A and B, respectively, diffuse inwards from the
inert atmosphere outside on to the surface; and (3) the rate at which the product AB
diffuses outwards. Nernst* has recently advanced a general theory of reactions in
heterogeneous systems based on measurements of the rates of solution of salts in
water, or of metals and such substances as magnesia, marble and metallic hydroxides
in acids. He assumes that, for all practical purposes, the rate at which equilibrium
is established at the limiting surface between the two phases (solid-liquid or solid-gas)
is infinitely great compared with the rates of diffusion of the reacting substances on
to, or of the reaction product away from, the surface. Hence the velocity observed
in the system will depend not on the “order” of the reaction, but on the diffusion
factors only. Our experiments have proved that this “ diffusion” theory is incapable
of explaining the facts of the catalytic combination of hydrogen and oxygen. There
are clearly other factors which have a determining influence on the course of events.

BoDENSTEN’s Haperiments.

In the year 1899 M. BopEnsrext published the results of experiments on the non-
explosive combination of electrolytic gas during its passaye through a glazed porcelain
tube heated in a lead bath to various temperatures between 482° and 689°. The
author was himself conscious of certain inherent sources of error in his experimental
method, which influenced the results quite irregularly and often in a very annoying
manner (‘in oft recht unliebsamer Weise”). In view of this admission it is difficult
to say what is the precise significance of his work. Whilst fully recognising that he
was dealing with a surface phenomenon entirely, BopENsTerN concluded that it is
