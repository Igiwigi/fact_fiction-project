It will thus be seen that the changes
made in the * Bellerophon ' from the © Minotaur * have had the effect of rendering the
maximum bending-moment about one fourth what it would have been if the long fine
type had been conformed to. I may add that the concentration of weights amidships,
due to the adoption of the central battery-and-belt system, has had much to do with
this; while it has been shown that sagging-moments do not result from the excess of
weights amidships. 'This fact adds one more to the numerous advantages previously
shown to be possessed by this system, as compared with the system of complete protection
exemplified in the © Minotaur,” 'The case of the © Audacious * (illustrated by Plate XVII.
tig. 10) gives further support to this view. ' The hogging-moment amidships does not
exceed 3400 foot-tons, and that at the section of absolute maximum strain in the after
body is only 11,000 foot-tons,—that is, equals the product of the displacement by about
the hundred-and-fiftieth (44g) part of the length. With respect to the type represented
by the © Victoria and Albert,” it will be sufficient to state that the maximum hogging-
moment (at @ a, Plate XVI. fig.
