figures. It would be worthwhile to update the calculations using the most current data to see if .
the general conclusions still hold.

The procedure sketched by Chakravarty ef al. [25] is an approach to only one of the ‘dual
obligations’ [4] constituent of a full account of international justice with regard to climate change,
namely the domestic reductions in emissions. The other essential component of international
justice, as indicated earlier, is financial and technological transfers that enable the reduction of
emissions elsewhere to the extent of each nation’s remaining unfulfilled responsibility. If such
transfers are targeted to replace fossil fuel with non-carbon energy affordable by and accessible to
the poor, they will mitigate in a manner that enhances, even if it is not fully adequate to, poverty
alleviation.

When we turn from principle to fact, the picture is if anything even clearer. The absence of
any necessary conflict between ambitious mitigation and poverty alleviation could be shown at
a time, such as 2009 when Chakravarty et al. did their illustrative calculations, at which it was
tacitly assumed that the cheapest sources of energy were fossil fuels, so that any reduction in
energy poverty by the poorest would have to mean increased carbon emissions by them. They
would be able to afford only carbon energy, it was assumed, so any alleviation of their poverty
would necessarily require additional carbon emissions. And certainly the reductions in poverty
in China over the last two decades have come at the painful planetary price of the burning of
massive amounts of coal and the release of enormous amounts of CO3. But it is now increasingly
widely recognized that, thanks in part to China’s own large investments in non-carbon energy,

China could be the last nation to have to follow the old coal-based nineteenth-century model
from the Industrial Revolution originally followed by Europe and North America.
