The 2-spinor zy’ is also taken parallel-propagated along each ray y—providing a -scaled
ray [’—the phase freedom applying to each ray as a whole. This defines our required bundle
7-space NV. In fact (up to a twofold sign ambiguity) the phase is geometrically realized as a null
2-plane (‘flag plane’ [1]) through the null-vector direction determined by p". In the flat-space case,
this phase freedom is simply the Z+> e!@Z noted in §1, our circle bundle WV over pN being N. The geometric (pre-)quantization connection [9] is defined by the 1-form # (= ~iZ~dZ*, in the
canonical flat case).
