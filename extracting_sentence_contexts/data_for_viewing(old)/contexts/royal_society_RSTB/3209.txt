Ungulate, with the young ot a Carnivore, or even of the Rodents, Insectivores,
or man.

Roprnson’s suggestion of “apposite” placenta for non-deciduate and “ conjoined ”
placenta for deciduate, although getting rid of the objections to the old terms, does
not, so it seems to me, strike at the root of the matter. He says: “the former
(term) to indicate that the layers are merely in apposition, and can be separated
without any necessary rupture or tearing, and the latter to indicate that the foetal
and maternal sections of the organ are united together or conjoined.”

I doubt very much whether there is more tearing of tissues in some of the Rodents
than there is in the dugong or sheep at birth, And can we not with equal propriety
—in fact, I think with greater consisteney—describe the rat’s after-birth as apposed
as that of the sheep, in which there is very obvious interdigitation of villi?

All these terms refer to the condition at birth—or the relations of the after-birth
to the maternal part of the apparatus.

As a result of a more thorough investigation into the development of the placenta
of mammals, one perceives how great is the difficulty of differentiating between the
various types, and how many are the resemblances which really exist.

Just in the same way as great difficulty is experienced by zoologists in forming a
satisfactory classification of such groups as the Porifera, owing to the great diversity
of characters, and yet abundance of connecting forms, so is there difticulty in the
