The equations (4) may, in the notation just introduced, be expressed as follows :—

(6) U=V=W=o0. The Velocity-distribution Function for a Uniform Gas.

§2(D) When the gas is uniform, all the derivatives of T and of (1%, 1, w,) are zero,
and f must depend only on m, T, and (U,V, W). It has, in fact, been shown by
MAXweE-t and others* that

and R is the universal gas constant in the characteristic equation of a gas:

The Distribution Function for a Non-uniform Gas.

§2(E) When the gas is slightly non-uniform, / will differ slightly from the value
given by (7), which we shall denote by /,: we may therefore write

(10) f(U, V, W) =f, (U, V, W) {1+ F(U, Vv, W)} = (Mae) eramerevow {14 F(U, v,W)}. The function F will be of the same order of magnitude as the variations of
temperature and velocity in the gas ; these space derivatives we shall regard as being
of the first order, and as we shall neglect second order quantities throughout our
work, no products of derivatives will occur in F. Hence, since F vanishes when the
variations in the gas are zero, it must be a linear function of the space derivatives
of T and (%, %, wy), with no term independent of these derivatives.
