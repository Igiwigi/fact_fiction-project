As remarked earlier, we need a better explanation of
Weber's law (the scalar uncertainty in the brainâ€™s represen-
tation of quantities). Assuming scalar noise in the numerons
themselves has intolerable computational consequences. Thus, we should take note of the fact that a scheme that divides
a number into an exponent and a significand is a scheme that
obeys Weber's law. The exponent establishes the range of mag-
nitudes, while the number of digits in the significand indicates
how finely quantities within that range are specified. The
imprecision with which a quantity is specified is then propor-
tionate to the scale.
