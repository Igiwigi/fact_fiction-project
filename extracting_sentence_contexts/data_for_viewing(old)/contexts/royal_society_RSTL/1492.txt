zon ; from which arise two pieces GG and EL, at right angles,
therefore parallel to the horizon. In the upper piece EL is a
female screw, through which the screw A passes ; 80 that the
head P, being turned round, will raise the frame EF or de-
press it. In the bottom part GF there is a slit MM, through
which the rod NO passes. This rod passes through a piece of
brass PP at Q, where it is fixed, s0 that by screwing forward
the screw A, the point Q, and the rod NO consequently, will be
raised up, and e contra. The point Q is placed exactly under
the centre- of the screw A.

This point Q is to be considered as the point C, fig. 1.
For although in fact the part of the rod HK where the screw
A passes, and rests upon the end of the rod HK, be the point
C,tig. 1; yet if a part of the tube I I, fig. g, at the point C be
taken at an-equal height with Q, fig. 4, as they are both of brass,
both will expand equally. If the whole should be heated, the
expansion of CH, fig. g, will raise up the bar HK, and the ex-

pansion of the screw A, and the frame EF, will carry down
the point Q, so that it shall always be at an equal height with
the point C, fig. 3, The points C and Q, fig. g, 4, therefore,
