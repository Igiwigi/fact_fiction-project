(86, 87). SHERRINGTON and BALANCE also give a list of writers who deny to
migrating leucocytes any power of further development, and seek to show by
own experiments that CouNHEIM and ZIEGLER are wrong.

Since then Mercunikorr (45) has attempted to prove that mononuclear leucoe
are capable of transformation into epithelial cells, and quotes researches to pi
that the nuclei present in polynuclear leucocytes may fuse together and for
mononuclear leucocyte.

My researches, hitherto carried on upon preserved tissue only, and studied
means of sections, cannot be utilised with the hope of making important additic
to the knowledge which has been gained by the admirable investigations of |
writers quoted above ; nevertheless there are certain facts shown in my preps
which are not without interest.

The peculiarities of the nucleus or nuclei of leucocytes and the readiness
which they stain, make them very prominent objects in section, and serve to
tinguish them readily from the cells of the surrounding tissue ; so that I have
confidence in stating they do not appear, in my specimens of recuperating mucosa,
take any part whatever in the re-formation of that tissue.

As I have already pointed out, the greatest proportion of leucocytes are alw√©
found in the vessels, not in the tissue. Further, not only is there no evidence
diapedesis of leucocytes, but they show no signs of taking advantage even of ruptv
vessels in order to migrate into the surrounding tissue ; their presence outside
