Interrupted and continuous applications of Teeth.—The deduction of the
carnivorous nature of the extinct Marsupials in question was drawn not from shape
merely, but from correlation of teeth. The © arbitrariness,” if sach quality be predi-
cable of the conclusion, is applicable to the guiding principle, not to the palzontologist
confiding therein. If reference to confirmatory and collateral facts was omitted in the
Papers of 1859 and 1869, it was under the belief of their being the common property
of the interpreters of fossil remains. In the adaptively modified dentition of the class Mammalia the differently shaped
teeth are put, some to occasional and interrupted, others to continuous use. The
incisors of the child biting a piece of bread and butter exemplify the first functional
character ; the molars which pound the piece bitten off, the second.
