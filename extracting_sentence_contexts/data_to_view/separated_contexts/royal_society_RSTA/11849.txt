M. HILL ON A SPHERICAL VORTEX. 245

The extreme limits of d' corresponding to surfaces inside the vortex sphere are }a*
and 0, and as d* diminishes from 4a to 0, d increases from 0 to 1. Putting

F(A) =(2 =a)" [ (1 =A sin’ gy ag,
PaA)=—-t2—- ay cos 26 (1 — d sin *4)—** dd

=1(2— Va cos 26 [(1 — d cos?) — (1 — A sin? 4)-*?] dg.

a Since 0 < ¢ < 41, every element of the integral is positive.
a Hence F” (A) is positive ; and, therefore, as \ increases from 0 to 1, F (A) increases

from ato.

2 Hence as d* diminishes from j4a* to 0, the time of revolution increases from
HAan/3Z to o.

= The fact, that when d*= 0, the time is infinitely great, may be verified by finding
Sthe time along the axis of the vortex sphere from end to end, and the time along a
=neridian from one end of the axis to the other.

£ This result does not constitute a difficulty, for if a particle anywhere on the axis of
éthe sphere could reach the extremity then it would not be clear along which meridian
of the sphere it should subsequently move.

6 If again the particles on any meridian of the sphere could reach the extremity of
rgthe axis, there would at that extremity be a collision of the particles coming in from
gal possible meridians,
