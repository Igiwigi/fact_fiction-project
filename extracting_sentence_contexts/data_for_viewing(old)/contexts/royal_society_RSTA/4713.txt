KC 2*,w <tonKand moreover, by taking ft + € for € > 0 very small, we can suppose that |K| > 0. a
Now, as wo* € H}(2*) ial Hy (2*) is the unique minimizer of the functional

[Vw :=
WR —w)dx, Dy
R\ 2 1a

in H\(2*), we can test its optimality with the function w € HU(2*) defined as : s&s

Wp= Wee on R?\K and w;=t onK,

obtaining that w; = we« and so wg» =t on K. On the other hand, as K is of positive measure, we
have Awg« =0 on K, which is a contradiction with the fact that —-Awg« = 1 0n 2*.
As a consequence of the above observations, we obtain the following result.

Theorem 4.1. Suppose that the open simply connected set 2* CR? of finite measure is a (local)
subsolution for the functional E + c| - | in the class of open simply connected sets. Then

(i) 2* is a bounded set. Moreover, there exist constants C,r9 > 0 depending on the measure of 2,
d,¢ and c such that 2 can be covered with less than Cr~4— balls of radius r, for every r <1;
(ii) 2* has finite generalized perimeter in the sense of De Giorgi, and

[SPeni2" <|Q*|.
