The
syncitial nature of the earthworm axons has been proved by tracing the axons which
compose them back to their cell bodies, and by degeneration experiments in which it
was shown that the giant fibres do not degenerate on either side of any cut made in them
(see Stough 1926). The results of the degeneration experiments here described are not a conclusive proof
that the prawn median and lateral axons also are syncitial in structure, but they are
reinforced by the observation of apparent fusions between the large axons and small
collaterals in each ganglion. And the fact that the median and lateral fibres are the only
large axons not provided with typical Ranvier nodes is further evidence of their structural
dissimilarity from the axons having single cell bodies. It has been noted in cephalopods
that some giant fibres are formed by the fusion of the axons of many small cell bodies,
while others equally large are the processes of single giant cells (Young 1939), a distinction
which would be similar to that between the prawn median and lateral fibres on the one
hand and the motor fibres on the other. It may be concluded that the median and lateral
prawn fibres are probably like the earthworm giant-fibres in being syncitial structures:
the median fibres differ from those of the earthworm, however, in passing with a con-
tinuous axoplasm from the supraoesophageal ganglion to the last abdominal segment of
the nerve cord.
