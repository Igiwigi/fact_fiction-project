By substituting condition (3.3) into equation (2.21) and pre-multiplying by Zo!, the incremental
equilibrium becomes

Zo'K(P) Zo G* + Zo'K(P) GL) =Zo'f, (3.8)

where the right-hand side can be written more explicitly using the partitioning introduced by
equation (3.22) as
i
f' +4 f
pof
f° +f? +f" +f"

The fact that the only non-vanishing forces are assumed to be the internal forces transmitted at
the unit cell boundary by the neighbouring cells implies f’ = 0. Moreover, as the displacement
field satisfying the Cauchy—Born hypothesis generates internal forces in the infinite lattice that are
periodic along the direct basis {a,,a2}, any single unit cell is subject to external boundary forces
that are anti-periodic. Consequently, f! = —f", f? =—f' and f” =f" — ft —f", so that the term
Zo'f vanishes and equation (3.8) becomes

Zolf=

Zo'K(P) Zo @* = —Zo'K(P) A(L). (3.9)

The solution of the linear system (3.9) provides the incremental periodic displacement field q*
internal to the lattice for every given L. As a consequence of the linearity of q(L), the solution
