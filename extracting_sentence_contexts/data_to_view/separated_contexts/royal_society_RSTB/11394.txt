However, the
social network is also a collective intelligence where the group
whole is greater than the sum of individual intelligences [22]. My discussion of spatial and social cognition notwithstanding,
I conceptualize ‘collective intelligence’ in network rather than
in cognitive terms. In fact, I argue that the connectedness and
immersion of humans in social networks means that collective
decisions can be understood even if they are not declared expli-
citly [5]. However, I also acknowledge that physical space plays
a significant role in the creation, maintenance and death of
social ties and networks [23-25]. A key mechanism behind
the influence of space on social networks is the structuring of
face-to-face interpersonal encounters and interactions.
