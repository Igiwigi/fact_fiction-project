In fact, all studies have
shown that the drag reduction decreased with Re, so much so that drag increased beyond baseline
resistance at some critical Reynolds number. Conversely, the rheometer and microchannel studies
have shown no drag reduction until the onset of turbulence, and then increased drag reduction
as Re increased. The discrepancy alluded to above also highlights the fact that decreasing 5, alters both Ay
and k+. However, the effect of altering AY with Re is not straightforward. For example, Kim &
Min [48] have hypothesized, and Fukagata et al. [51] have shown, that the effects of streamwise
and spanwise slip act independently.
