The mid-gut passes into the short region termed by van WyyHE (1916)
the ilio-colon ring (icr.), and from this the hind-gut (Ag.) passes straight to the anus. According to vAN WiHE it is uncertain whether the ring should be regarded as
belonging to the hind-gut or to the mid-gut. In the light of the facts to be described
below, the non-committal terms “ mid-gut’’, “‘hind-gut”’ and “ mid-gut diverticulum”’
seem preferable to such terms as “‘stomach”, “intestine”, “liver” and “hepatic
diverticulum” which have been used by various writers, and the former will therefore
be employed here throughout, as they have been by FRANz (19272). ph. oes, lcd. tb.
