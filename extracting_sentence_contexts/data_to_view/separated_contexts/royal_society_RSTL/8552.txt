A living Galapagos Tortoise in my possession prefers, at present, the petals of a Westeria
to every other plant. Of cours, by the thinness of the hell its weight is much reduced, and these Tortoises
aro therefore able to walk faster and to carry the shell higher above the ground than the othor species of this
genus. The thinness of the shell and the slender os8cous framework of the limbs are, in fact, characters cnxrolatel
to each other. + Withont epidermoid scutes. DR. A.
