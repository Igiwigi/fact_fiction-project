Figure 7 presents the temporal evolution of the excited-state populations and the results of the
kinetic analysis. The populations were fitted to a sequential kinetic model with two parameters
t and 12, which we identify as the internal conversion (IC) and ISC time constants, respectively.
Errors for the parameters were obtained with the bootstrapping method [58], in order to judge
whether the number of trajectories is sufficient to describe these processes.

We obtain 1; =54+7 fs, meaning that the Ian* > Inon* population transfer is about 70%
after 100 fs (see the S; line in figure 7). Note that this is substantially different from the results
reported for uracil and thymine in previous SA-CASSCF-based dynamics simulations, where
much less was transferred within 100 fs, because longer time constants were obtained for this
pathway [21,24,59-62]. This difference is due to the fact that at SA-CASSCF level the lin* state
is higher in energy than with MRCIS, and therefore population transfer from â€˜22* to tnom* is
slower at SA-CASSCF level.

The second time constant we obtain is t2 = 450 + 100 fs. That is, within 400 fs, 51% of the non-
dissociating trajectories have moved to the triplet states and 49% are still in the singlet manifold.
The calculated ISC time scale matches well with the 0.4 ps time constant reported in [16] for time-
resolved pump-probe experiments (266nm pump and 330nm probe) on 5BU in water. In the
same experiment, they also observe a nanosecond component, which could be assigned to the
population trapped in the triplet states.

Interestingly, the time constant of 450fs obtained for ISC in 5BU is smaller than those
previously reported for U and T [21,24], which are approximately 800 fs and 900 fs, respectively.
