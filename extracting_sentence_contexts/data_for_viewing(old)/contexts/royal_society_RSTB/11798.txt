LMA calculated from conspecific measurements from TRY.
We found that our garden-based measures of LMA were signifi-
cantly positively correlated with the mean LMA values
measured in situ on wild conspecifics (Pearson’s r= 0.7,
d.f.=15, p<0.01) (figure 4). Next, we tested whether the
trait values measured at FTBG are better or worse predictors
of species’ mean trait values than trait measurements collected
at individual field sites. To do this, we calculated the correlation
between the LMA values available in TRY from individual field
sites with the mean LMA values of the corresponding species
(mean values calculated excluding the individual site being
tested). Based on this analysis, we found that our garden-
based measures of LMA are, in fact, a better predictor of species’
mean trait values than 80% of the plot-based studies (electronic
supplementary material, figure S1).

In a second set of analyses using the same study species,
we used a null-model bootstrapping procedure (see Material
and methods) to test if the distributions of three leaf traits
(LMA, N and A,,,x) measured on plants grown in FTBG are
representative of the overall distributions of those trait values
in the TRY databases. We found no significant difference
between the trait distributions of these traits based on individ-
uals sampled at FTBG and in TRY (p =0.39; figure 5 and
electronic supplementary material, figure S2).
