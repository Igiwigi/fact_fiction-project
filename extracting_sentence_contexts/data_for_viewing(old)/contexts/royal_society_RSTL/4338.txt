inner and outer membranes of the circular vessel.

In the Phanerocarpz (Phacellophora) the marginal corpuscle (figs. 25, 25 a.) is placed
at the extremity of a short double-walled tubular pedicle projecting downwards or

towards the ventral surface of the disc ; the nnder margins of the fissure in which it
is lodged are prolonged into two overlapping fringes. The cavity of the pedicle is
continuous with that of a canal which runs from the common cavity directly towards
the corpuscle. Its walls are continuous, the inner with the inner wall of the canal,
the outer with the substance of the dise. The pedicle is in fact a mere process of the
system of canals, 80 that the position of the marginal vesicle is relatively to this
system the same as in the Cryptocarpm, . A similar remark holds good with regard
to the Rhizostomide.

22. In Cephea and Rhizostoma the organ is placed in a notch between two lobe-
like processes of the margin of the disc, and looks upwards. On the upper surface a
semilunar fold extends from one lobe to the other and covers in the corpuscle ; below,
the edges of the lobes are thinned and overlap, figs. 33, 34.

23. There are some peculiarities in Rhizosoma which deserve to be noticed more
fully. On the dorsal surface, behind the semilunar fold above mentioned, there is a
large heart-shaped depression (fig. 33) with its base towards the corpuscle. Its 8ur-
