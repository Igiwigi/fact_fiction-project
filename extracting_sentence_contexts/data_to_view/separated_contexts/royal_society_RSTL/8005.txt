Others exhibit the columella and the large septa and the
normal septal arrangement (octomeral). But one rather deformed coral exhibited on
a fractured surface which was at right angles to the long axis six large septa instead
of the usual eight: this of course required careful examination and explanation. The
septa in the lower and therefore older part of the coral were clearly irregular in their
growth ; but a section midway between this portion and the fractured part established
the interesting fact that the lower part of the corallum possessed the normal octomeral
septal arrangement, and that the upper, in consequence of the abortion of two septa, had
the Neozoic hexameral type. This is very suggestive in the matter of the evolution of
hexameral from octomeral types, or rather from the tetrameral. Mareh 24, 1871.
