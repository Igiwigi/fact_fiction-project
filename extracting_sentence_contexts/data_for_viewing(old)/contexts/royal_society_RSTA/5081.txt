versus Eeq in figure 9a and the values of f/fo at first localization and at the onset of coalescence
as a function of T in figure 9b. The separation between first localization and coalescence for T >
is brought out clearly in the latter figure. Figure 9b also reveals that there is some uncertainty in
identifying the onset of coalescence owing to the fact that each simulation must be monitored
step by step to identify the point where the localization condition is met. For T <1, the onset
of localization and coalescence occurs when the void volume fraction reaches f = 0.03 in this
example, a relatively small value which, nevertheless, is 30 times the initial value. Thus, while
macroscopic localization and coalescence occur simultaneously when T < 1, extensive prior void
growth has occurred to set the stage for these events which is not predicted by a coalescence
model. This illustrates the important point that, even though macroscopic localization and
coalescence occur simultaneously, a coalescence analysis by itself cannot be used to predict the
dependence of localization on the initial void volume fraction.

The results for the effective strain in the band at first localization and at the onset of coalescence
as a function of T are plotted in figure 10 for the critical band angle where they can be compared
with the corresponding results for the case with the normal band, wy =0°. In addition, the
