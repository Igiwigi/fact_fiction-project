As Allwood and others have demonstrated, a full gamut of responses will be necessary, including
far-reaching changes in the use and demand for materials, rather than improvements to efficiency

2. Coleridge on imagination and fancy

The human faculty of imagination has been a longstanding topic of philosophical fascination,
not least because it stands at the intersection of perception, understanding and action, and for its
capacity to relate past, present and future. To speak about imagination in that way, however, is
already to identify it as something wider and more fundamental to human function than would
be suggested by typical uses of the word today. In its contemporary, more restrictive sense,
‘imagination’ would belong to the domain of artistic creativity. On that view, a novelist would
be ‘imaginative’ while she is writing her fiction but not, for instance, while she is driving her car.
A sculptor would be imaginative in sculpting, but a member of the public would not necessarily
be imaginative in viewing what he had made.
