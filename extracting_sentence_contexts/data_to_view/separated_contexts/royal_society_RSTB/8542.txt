This idea was examined lular plasticity that are independent of NMDA receptor
by deleting NMDA receptors specifically from CA3 neurons function that could support hippocampal circuit modification
in mice [30]. The animals were tested for spatial learning in with memory [35-39]. Finally, it is possible that NMDA-

mice in their acquisition and retrieval in the standard refer- fact contribute to the formation of memory, but because of

mice showed impaired spatial memory retrieval consistent disrupt behavioural recall. As this brief discussion illustrates,
with a difficulty in pattern completion.
