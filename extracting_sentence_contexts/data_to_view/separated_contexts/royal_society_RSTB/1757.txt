With the advancing age of the husbands the effect is naturally the reverse: the
older the husband the younger is the wife required to be in order to secure the same
level of fertility (see Table IV.).

3. If for any age of the mother we advance from the lower degree of natality to
the higher ones, the paternal age advance becomes always smaller (as may be seen by
reading the figures in Table V., as they follow along the same line). This is caused
by the fact that with young people, where the age distance is but small, the fertility
is the greatest. If we advance according to the paternal age, we arrive at reciprocal
values.

* Example: In Table IV. (p. 849) we find that the natality of, for instance, 15 per cent. is obtained
for the fathers of 40, 41, and 42 years with mothers of 38. Starting now from the maternal age, we
accepted the corresponding paternal age with the average of 41, and thus the age-difference with 3 years
(see Table V., p. 859, last column).
