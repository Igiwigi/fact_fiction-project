[6, p. 295]. Their only grounds for this correlation appear to have been
the presence of Pseudomonotis ovalis, which at that time had not been found so high
as the Pusey Flags. It is impossible, however, to disregard (i) the lithological resemblance
to the Wheatley Limestones, (ii) the fact that in the Berkshire Oolites the shells are
whole and perfect, while in these rocks they are ground up, and (iii) the strong negative
evidence of the absence of all the Berkshire Oolite Perisphinctids, Cardiocerates,
Aspidocerates and characteristic Lamellibranchs. A somewhat similar section at Dogridge, west of Purton, shows 5 ft. of Coral Rag
overlying 14 ft. of Wheatley Limestones. he latter are here on the whole softer, being
fit only for lime-burning, and are much less fossiliferous, though of the same minute
composition.
