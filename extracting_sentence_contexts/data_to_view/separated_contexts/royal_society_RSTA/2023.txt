A nickel line in this position is given by RowLAND, but not by ExXNeR and HascHEK.


BAND OF AMMONIA, AND ITS OCCURRENCE IN THE SOLAR SPECTRUM. 363

The coincidences in the case of the central maximum as a whole are scarcely less
striking. The majority of the solar lines in this region in fact appear to be due to
ammonia, as will be seen from the table, where the solar lines from 3363'4 to 3358°0
are tabulated in full in order to bring out this feature. In this small region there
are 47 solar lines, at an average distance apart of 0°117A, and 37 ammonia band lints,
at an average distance of 0°149A. Thirty-four of the ammonia lines are either
represented directly by reasonably appropriate lines in RowLanp’s table, or fall upon
solar lines of recognised or probable metallic origins. The absence of one of the
remaining three lines is satisfactorily accounted for by its low intensity.
