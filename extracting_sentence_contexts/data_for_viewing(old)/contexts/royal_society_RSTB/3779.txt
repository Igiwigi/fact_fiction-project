according as the rod-width is 0°83 or 0°42 4, I now propose to compare these results
with others obtained from the Protozoa, for we may thus be able to elucidate the
problems of the origin of chromosomes and their later differentiation into the two
groups mentioned above.

In what appears to be the most primitive type of Protozoa no nucleus exists, and
the chromatin granules are scattered throughout the entire*mass of protoplasm ; this
has been observed in certain Rhizopoda and Flagellata, eg. Achromatium and
Tetramitus, which have respectively been shown by ScHEWIAKOFF and CALKINS to
undergo a fission of granules prior to cell division. In remarking upon this W1Lson
says “the arrangement of chromatin granules to form chromosomes appears to be of a
secondary importance as compared with higher forms,” and refers again to it as
“sustaining BraveEr’s conclusion that the essential fact in the history of the
chromatin in mitosis is the fission of individual granules.”

Chromosomes have, however, been observed in many forms, included in the Heliozoa,
Rhizopoda, Flagellata, and Infusoria, and may or may not be preceded by a spireme
stage. They appear to arise, as Wiison has shown, through the linear arrangement
of granules, which often result from fragmentation of one or more large chromatin
masses.

In the Infusoria, upon which exhaustive work has been done by Hickson and others,
two kinds of nuclei exist, differing fundamentally and called respectively the mega-
