But this does not prevent our normal
stress explaining all that MAxwe t's stress explains, and, indeed, from the remarks
at the beginning of last section, it is now evident that for all useful purposes either
the one stress or the other will serve equally well.

70. We have now compared the results of the present theory with all MaxwEz1’s
results contained in equations (5) to (17), § 60, above, except (16). Except for
equations (12), (13), the agreement is exact, and I think it may now be claimed that
what the present theory gives instead of equation (12), agrees, as well as (12), with
known facts, and what it gives instead of (13) agrees better than (13). Equation (16) itself is obvious enough since it merely asserts that H’ has a potential
when there are no currents in the field. But it suggests another question—does the
present theory lead to the ordinary mathematical theory of electromagnetism?
