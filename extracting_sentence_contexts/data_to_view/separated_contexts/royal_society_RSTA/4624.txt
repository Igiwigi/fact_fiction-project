The proponents of this approach contend that it can be applied to nearly everything
within the field of nonlinear structural dynamics (and indeed any domain where models are
developed in conjunction with field data). This connection to ‘nearly everything’ is appealing,
and there is certainly scope for wider application of the methods that are under development. There are two significant impediments to widespread adoption of these methods: a psychological 1s |
barrier, as the language of Bayesian inference is not generally well known in industry; and also
the fact that such methods still require efficient underlying numerical models that can feasibly “3
be computed many times. The developments presented in this theme issue [9] go some way to 1B
minimizing the number of simulation runs necessary. 1
