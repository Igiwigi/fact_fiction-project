wux is prepared, and a measured quantity, sufficient to give a sheet thicker than is required, is ladled out
and poured over the hot glycerine. It is then allowed to cool and solidify. As it solidifies it must be cut
away from the sides of the dish or it will be torn by contraction. The sheet is lifted from the glycerine
by means of a false floor of perforated zinc, washed with water, and allowed to dry. It is then covered
by a thin sheet of paper on each side, and run through a roller press (with hot rollers) such as is used by
photographers for burnishing photographic prints. The interval between the rollers is adjustable, and

fuiform sheets of any desired thickness can -be obtained in this way with a perfection not to be met with
in those put upon the market by German firms.

The planing machine is a steel bed resting upon four millimetre screws at the corners, it works vertically
up and down in a frame, the upper sides of which provide a sliding surface for the planing tool. The
importance of planing to a measured thickness is due to the fact that it is impossible to attach* the sheets
of wax one to another in such a manner as to secure perfect contact between them ; a small but measurable
interval always exists between the two opposed surfaces, and the sum of these intervals in a long series of
sections would give a markedly greater thickness to the model than it ought to possess. By planing
down after the addition of each sheet the model is kept to its true thickness.

* The simplest way to attach the sheets is to stick a hot needle through them, the melted wax makes a
firm connection when solid ; unfortunately, however, it intrudes by surface tension between the sheets, and
thus establishes an interval.
