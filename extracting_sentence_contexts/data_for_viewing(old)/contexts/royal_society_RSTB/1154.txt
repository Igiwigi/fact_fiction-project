It is descriptive of all afferent fibres in the cord, which may be supposed to be
connected with those of the posterior root, but which do pot show any of the
degenerative and developmental differences which stamp some fibres (posterior
median) as being in direct continuity with the root, There is, however, nothing in
itself to show that this term indirect ig a strictly logical one; since the same line
of argument might be applied to those fibres which pass through the ganglion on the
posterior root, with regard to which the degeneration method furnishes no evidence
of direct continuity (JosEPH).

Impulses are conducted thraygh the ganglion jn either direction (pu Bots-
ReyMonD), and apparently without any modification in their time relations (Exner)
if we may suppose that this is due to the fact that, apart from the few fibres which
appear not to come into relation with cells at all, the relationship of the majority of
fibres to the ganglion cells is of the T-piece kind, as shown by Ranvier, in which
case the cell does not interrupt the continuity of the connected fibre. There is no
reason why some such sort of bypath (Gota1) may not be the basis of the con-
nection of the fibres with the corpuscular elements in the spinal cord, as it is in
certain parts of the cerebrum (FLECHSIG).

There are, therefore, no anatomical data which are necessarily implied in the term
indirect as applied to these fibres, beyond the fact that such fibres come into
