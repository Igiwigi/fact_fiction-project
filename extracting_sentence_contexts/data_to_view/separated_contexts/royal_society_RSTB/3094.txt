410 DR. M. BENSON ON MIADESMIA MEMBRANACEA, BERTRAND ;

The microsporophylls, which bear a similar ligule, are found associated with the

megasporophylls and vegetative organs. Further facts have been obtained relating to the foliage leaves which are present in
great quantities in many of the slides. Sometimes they occur in their natural
position on the axis, and these twigs occur in longitudinal and transverse section. No roots nor organs of attachment have been identified.
