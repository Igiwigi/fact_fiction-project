Cell division was now also active in the underlying
dermis and hypodermis in which, as has been shown, it is normally rare. Mitoses were
commonly seen in the connective tissue cells and in the endothelial cells lining the newly
forming capillaries, and they were even present, although less frequently, in the striped
muscle of the panniculus carnosus, a region which, in this respect, is normally entirely
inert. In addition, an unusually high rate of cell division was present in any closely adjacent
hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and, in fact, with the apparent exception of the leuco-
cytes, all cell types lying within a radius of about 0-5 mm. of the wound were stimulated to
divide, the effect dying away very rapidly at greater distances. After the fourth day, with healing almost complete, the scab began to peel off, and when
this had happened the line of the wound on the skin was rapidly obscured. In section,
however, it was seen that the epidermis was still about four or five times thicker than
normal, partly due to the cells remaining large in size and partly to their greatly increased
numbers following the abnormally high rate of division.
