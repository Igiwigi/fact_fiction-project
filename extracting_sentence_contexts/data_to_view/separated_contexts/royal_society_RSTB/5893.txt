The gnathobase of an adult Hstheria
is exceedingly complex, fig. 22, but in the larval
form it passes through stages which closely
resemble those of Lepidocaris. In fact, the
only real difference is that the gnathobase of
Estheria has two claws instead of one. How-
ever, the fact that there is only one claw in
Lepidocaris is, 1 think, of little significance. From a study of the adult gnathobases of other
Branchiopoda, especially those of the Cladocera
I think the important fact is that there is a
ridge capable of bearing claws or spines, at
least on its posterior part.
