where N is the normalization coefficient of the Lorentzian, 09 is the characteristic length of
competition, 1 describes how the non-local interaction decays with the distance and the term (1 +
nb(r, t))? allows the model from [7] to exhibit bistability behaviour between two homogeneous
steady states. As in model equation (2.1), the model in [7] exhibits bistability and non-local
coupling. We have considered the model in [7] to illustrate that strong non-local competition
and bistability are the main ingredients to obtain FCs. However, the analysis considering water
transport process is more sophisticated (include more variables, parameters, etc.). Because this
fact, we have developed the majority of our work based on equation (2.1), which is simpler and
easier to manipulate.

3. Fairy circles formation: numerical simulations

Considering a regime far from any pattern forming instability, we focus on the parameters where
the bistability between the bare and the uniformly vegetated states takes place. To generate
FCs, we need to connect these two homogeneous states. This connection is referred to as front.
Depending on the choice of the non-local coupling function, front interaction between vegetated
and bare states can be either strong or weak [1]. All ecological models used a weak non-local
