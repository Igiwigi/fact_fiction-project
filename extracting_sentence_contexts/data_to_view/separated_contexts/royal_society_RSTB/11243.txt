Furthermore, it has been shown symbolic stimuli (ie. Arabic numerals like ‘1, 5’ or written
that the SNARC effect is modulated by finger counting habits number words like ‘three, nine’, in either the visual or auditory

fact that the direction of the spatial—numerical association sort (e.g. multiplication or addition). Contrasts that involved
given by a writing system seems to be an important determi- judging numerosity or counting (e.g. five circles versus seven
