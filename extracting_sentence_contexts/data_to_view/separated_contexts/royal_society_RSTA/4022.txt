About half of the material would transform in this example. However, when the magnetic field is removed again, the initial state would not be reached. In fact, the adiabatic temperature change under cycling would be smaller, as indicated by the
horizontal double-sided arrow. This description of the thermal hysteresis can be transferred
straightforwardly to the first-order transition of inverse magnetocaloric materials, which is shown
in figure 2c,d.

3. Magnetic refrigeration and magnetocaloric materials

The development of a magnetocaloric cooling system based on the magnetocaloric principle at
ambient temperature has not yet been realized as an economic and industrial product.
