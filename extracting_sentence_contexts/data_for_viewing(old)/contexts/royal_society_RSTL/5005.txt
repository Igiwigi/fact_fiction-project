of the stomach and its dependent cw&ca are lined with vibratile epithelium. This fact
establishes a connection between the Echinoderm and the Medusz, the gastro-
vascular canals of which were proved to be similarly ciliated, whilst it disjoins them
in a striking manner from the Entozoa and Annelida, digestive organs of which, as
will be afterwards proved, are never furnished with vibratile epithelium. The
boundaries of the peritoneal cavity are universally ciliated. A the integumentary
membranous processes are lined within and without with ciliary epithelium, and con-
sist of hollow prolongations of the peritoneal cavity. In Asterias rubens, the cuta-
neous membranous processes are readily distended by injection thrown into the
peritoneal cavity. Thus injected they rise, in relief, to a considerable distance aboye
the plane of the integumentary surface.

They are ceacal at their distal ends. This fact is absolute throughout the Echino-
dermal families.

These processes in Asterias are disposed, on the dorsum of each lobe, in four longi-
tudinal series. They constitute the veritable respiratory organs. They are designed to
expose to the external, atrating element, not the true-blood, but the chylaqueous
fluid, the contents of the peritoneal cavity. If this fluid consisted only of pure
sea-water, what chemical change could result from such an exposure? No endosmotic
and exosmotic currents could occur between fluids of identical densities. And where-
fore that remarkable movement of the corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluids in the
