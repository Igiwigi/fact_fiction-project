Fig. 13 is
from the middle of the leaf, and its vein shows no true centripetal xylem, while
fig. 14 is from the apex and has an enormous amount.) The vascular bundle in the
apex of the leaf resembles that of the Cycad petiole or leaflet, where there is only a
trace of secondary wood, or none. This recently demonstrated occurrence of true
centripetal xylem towards the apex in Araucarian leaves makes their association with
Cordaites in internal structure, as well as in external form, a very intimate one. This view of the centripetal xylem is held in spite of the fact that JErFREY in
his work on Cretaceous pine leaves does not consider the tracheary tissue opposite the
protoxylem in the living Conifers to be centripetal xylem. He says (1908, p. 218):
“Tt seems much more highly probable, from the conditions observed in Prepinus and
in species of Cretaceous Pinus, that such elongated elements with bordered pits are
in reality vestiges of the ancestral inner transfusional sheath (of Cordaites), the real
centripetal xylem having disappeared at too early a stage to be represented even
vestigially in living Conifers.” Fusm, on the other hand, has recently called
attention to some of the anomalies of the centripetal xylem of Prepinus. He states
(1910, p. 204): “It may be a question whether any tracheal elements on the ventral
side of a centrifugal xylem developed regularly, in direct continuation with a medullary
ray of a stem or a medullary plate of a leaf in the same plane with the latter, and
not starting from one of the protoxylem elements, can be taken for elements of
a centripetal xylem.” In the arrangement in rows of the centripetal xylem of
Prepinus and in the alternation of these with the strands of broken down protoxylem
he finds no parallel in any true centripetal xylem.
