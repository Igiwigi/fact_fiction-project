enable us to ascertain how far these effects proceeded.

Rain does not appear to have fallen in abundance anywhere immediately around
the hill that afternoon and night while the eruption was at its maximum or drawing
gradually to a close. During the morning and forenoon there were local showers,
especially on the windward side, but, though they were heavy, they were certainly
not general. As already stated, the climax of the eruption was heralded in some
places by showers of hot mud, or wet, hot ashes, which scalded not a few people. But
on the leeward side the day was essentially dry, and at Kingstown, though the ash at
first fell wet, there were no rains of any consequence. It is not a little remarkable
that the discharge of such enormous quantities of water vapour into the air should not
have been accompanied by condensation or precipitation on a large scale; but, what-
ever may be the reasons for it, the fact remains that the great eruption of the
Soufriére was essentially a dry eruption.

When the great black cloud was seen rushing out to sea past Chateaubelair, even
those whom courage, or a sense of duty, or helplessness, had led to linger in the
village, were struck with one impulse to eseape. We have some graphic narratives of
that flight, which give us a picture of the demoralisation of the black population and
the terrors of the eruption, so vivid as to be worth reproducing here. Dr. Dunbar
Hueues and Captain Catprr, who had both gone there by order of the Administrator,
were the last to leave, and Captain Canper’s account of his escape is as follows* :—

“When the black people realised their danger most of them grew madly excited, and in a few minutes
everything in the shape of a boat or canoe pushed off from the shore, weighted down to a dangerous
