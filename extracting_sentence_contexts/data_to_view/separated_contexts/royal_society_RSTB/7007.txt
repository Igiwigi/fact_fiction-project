differences in dating between the various trackways, corresponding with the fact that the
Meare Heath and Shapwick Heath trackways appear to lie close to the (uncertainly
defined) opening of zone VII-VIII, and the Westhay trackway near the middle. All
three presumably are of Middle to Late Bronze Age. It is not unlikely, in view of the circumstances under which the trackways were built,
that the Blakeway Farm trackway is also of this age, a suggestion a little supported by the
nature of the axe-cuts in it.
