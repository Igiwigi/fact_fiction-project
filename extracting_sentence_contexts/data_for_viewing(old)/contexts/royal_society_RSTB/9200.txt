clinical microbiologists working in laboratories in England
have been encouraged to report both the identification and
antibiotic susceptibility of blood culture isolates to a national
database called LabBase2. Initially, reporting was on paper
forms but moved to electronic transmission of results in
the 1990s [5,6]. The outputs from this surveillance system
have tended to focus on national trends in resistance in
common pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, entero-
cocci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
[7-13]. Strengths of this surveillance system include wide geo-
graphical coverage, the large amount of data collected and the
fact that the data are readily available on a continuous basis
as routine outputs from laboratories. There are some weak-
nesses, however, including incomplete data collection as
reporting is done on a voluntary basis, variation in laboratory
testing methods and the fact that different laboratories may
test and report on different antibiotic panels for the same
pathogens. With regard to the variation in testing methods, it
should be borne in mind, however, that all hospital micro-
biology laboratories in England must be accredited and that a
requirement of accreditation is participation in the assessment
scheme run by the UK National External Quality Assessment
Service. As part of this scheme, pathogens with defined
