is then the desired cost-minimizing adapted optimal control, e.g. [17].

3. The mathematical structure of forecasts

In order to build forecast information into the Markov model of §2, we review the mathematical
structure of forecasts, so that we can ensure that the model combining Markovian state dynamics
and forecast information respects the appropriate mathematical constraints. To this end, we
assume that E||Wn||? <oo (where ||-|| is the Euclidian norm). We model the (point) forecast
Fyjx Of Wn available at time k <n as the rv E[Wy |G], where G, is a o-algebra representing the
information available to the forecaster. Since weather forecasters have available vastly more
weather information than does the energy system manager, we expect that G represents a strictly
richer ‘information set’ than FY £0(W;:j <k). Consequently, we require G; to be strictly larger
than FY . In fact, if Ge = Fi , the availability of forecasts will offer no advantage over the optimal
control (4; :0 <j <#) computed in §2, since that policy is already guaranteed to be optimal over

all FI -adapted policies.


We note that Frjn = Wn and that the tower property of conditional expectation implies that

ELF yea 1Ge] = E [E[Wal G4 11lG]
= E[WilG«]
=F ijk, (3.1)

so that (F;,x:k <n) is a martingale (in k) adapted to the G's for each fixed n € Z. For k <n, let
