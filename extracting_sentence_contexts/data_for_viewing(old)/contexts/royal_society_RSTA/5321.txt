A powerful tool in exploring these issues proved to be numerical integrations of the equation
of motion (4.1) to produce oscillatory functions that were then analysed with the same procedures


used to determine amplitudes and experimental values of 62 in analysing our actual G data.
These integrations were made using MATHEMATICA, with WorkingPrecision and AccuracyGoal
typically set to 400 and 20, respectively. Several tests of the accuracy of these integrations were [3
made. In one test, equation (4.1) was integrated setting I and k; equal to values corresponding 28
to our apparatus, £7 equal to As (the values generated by our source mass) and the remaining oS
torque components set to zero. The difference Aw? between w* found with + and —f2s should 18
agree extremely well with that calculated using only our first-order solution to equation (4.1), Reg
because second-order corrections to w, proportional to (8/k)*, cancel in forming Aw. In fact, Aw* a
with our simulation differed from the first-order prediction only by a fractional amount 3 x 10710. cal
That difference divided by w? was of the order of 10~!°. Having established the reliability of 2
our integration simulation technique with this and other tests, we then applied the technique to 8
determine the corrections required for the many extra small torque terms in the full equation of txt
motion. Results of this work are presented in §5d(ii). =

(c) Multipole expansion of the gravitational torque acting on the pendulum :2

We discuss here the vertical component of the torque on a pendulum of density Ppendulum(, 4, ¢) a]
in a potential field (r,0,) generated by external masses with density psource(",0,¢), Where the
polar coordinates r, 6 and @ are centred on the pendulum’s centre of mass with the polar axis : =
vertical. The mass multipole moments of the pendulum are as conventionally defined :s
