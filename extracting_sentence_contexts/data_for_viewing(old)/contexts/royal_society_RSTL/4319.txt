Srxa.—High water heights: diurnal inequality = 24 ft. Low water heights : diur-
nal inequality = 4 ft, High water times : diurnal inequality = 2 hours. Low water
times : diurnal inequality = 4 hour: irregular. North of this point the observations
are too imperfect to show diurnal inequality till we come to

KanrscnaTKa. Petropaulofsk.— High water heights: diurnal inequality = 1 ft.
Low water heights : diurnal inequality = 4 ft. High water times : diurnal inequality
= 4 hours. Low water times : diurnal inequality = 1 hour.

The tides of Sitka and Petropaulofsk have already been noticed in the Philoso-
phical Transactions*. I there pointed out the large diurnal inequality of times at
high water, and of heights at low water, which these places exhibit ;—also the
curious fact, that apparently the maximum and zero of the diurnal inequality of high
water do not coincide in time with those of low water, but rather alternate with
them.

47. I proceed to the islands of the Pacific.

Bow IsLand.,—There appears to be a diurnal inequality of the time of high water,
but necessarily doubtful, from the smallness of the tide.

Tamri,—Here also there appears, in a portion of the tides, to þe an alternation of
late and early, approaching to the nature of diurnal inequality.

Fears IsLanps.—High water heights: an evident diurnal inequality of half a foot.
