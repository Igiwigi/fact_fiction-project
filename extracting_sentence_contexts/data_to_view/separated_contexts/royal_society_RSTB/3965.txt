It will be seen from this table that during and just after the long-continued
powerful exertion the alveolar CO, pressure is much below normal, just as with the
shorter periods of great exertion; but that after the first few minutes of exertion the
respiratory quotient falls to about the normal value, the excess of preformed CO, in
the body having been blown off by the hyperpnea. On resting the respiratory
quotient falls below normal, while the alveolar CO, pressure gradually rises again to a
normal value. In the case of Y.H. the observations were complicated by the fact that
after the exertion there was a great tendency to periodic breathing, which made the
results somewhat irregular. The periodic breathing will be discussed later. A further series of observations on the alveolar air was made during the quite
moderate exertion of walking on the level at about four miles an hour.
