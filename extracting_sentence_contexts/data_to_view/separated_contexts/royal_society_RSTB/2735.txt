That sometimes the larvee remain of the winter type, even when reared in warmer
water, is almost certainly due to the fact that neither parent normally breeds in
the winter, and, therefore, the larvee are relatively weakly. This was found to be
the case with pure-bred larvze of both parents, so that it is only likely to be still
more marked in the hybrids, since they are more sensitive than either of the parent
forms. At first sight it seems unlikely that a difference in the healthiness and
rapidity of growth should cause the plutei to resemble one parent or the other, but
this is explained by the fact that all the more important features of the Spherechinus
pluteus are of a positive nature, while the larva of Strongylocentrotus is chiefly
distinguished by their absence. And it was shown that the only positive feature of
Strongylocentrotus, the club at the apex of the body-skeleton, was not reduced in
summer, but in some cases at least actually increased. For example, in No. 244
(June 12-20) there were large clubs 8 per cent., small 88 per cent., no club 4 per cent.,
compared with large 0, small 84 per cent., none 16 per cent.
