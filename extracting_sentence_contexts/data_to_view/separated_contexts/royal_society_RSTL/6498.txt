Again, it is observed that existing glacial valleys, and
those which are believed to have been such in former times, always indicate, by their
8moothed and striated rocks, the sliding movements of the glaciers they formerly con-
tained. In fact, few glacialists at present, I imagine, will doubt the existence of this
8liding motion, or that it forms a considerable portion of the whole motion of a glacier ;
and T believe that the experiments above described afford an adequate explanation of
the cause and character of that motion. I insist on this more particularly becanse the
explanation has been singularly ignored and misunderstood. 'The non-applicability of
the experiments has been asserted, because the sliding mass was not obstructed in its
motion by lateral obstacles, like a glacier, whereas, in fact, they had no concern with
lateral obstacles, being merely intended to explain the action of the bed of the valley
on the superincumbent glacier, The irregularity of the sides introduces, as we shall see
very shortly, no difficulty or ambiguity into my views of the subject. I may also state
that, several years after my experiments and his own observation above stated were pub-
lished, Principal Forres repeats his objection of the difficulty of conceiving the possibi-
lity of the motion of sliding glaciers being unaccelerated, whereas every one now acknow-
ledges that they do slide, and knows that their motion is unacceleratedf}, M. AGass1z,
on the contrary, after repeating the experiments, allows that the results remove the
great difficulties of admitting the sliding motion of glaciers).
