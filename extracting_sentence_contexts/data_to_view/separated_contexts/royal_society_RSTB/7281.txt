In an average ovary there are
at least six million ova 0-5 mm. or more in diameter, a size at which there is a considerable
amount of yolk already present. The ovary is thus unlike that of other elasmobranchs in
which there are usually a few large ova, and in general appearance is more like that of an
oviparous teleost. This is remarkable in view of the fact that Cetorhinus is almost certainly
viviparous. The unpaired infundibular part of the oviducts opens at the ostium abdominale and lies
shallowly embedded in the liver adjacent to the attachment of the falciform ligament. It
follows a course such that the ostium abdominale is brought directly opposite, and into
contact with, the pocket on the right side of the ovary.
