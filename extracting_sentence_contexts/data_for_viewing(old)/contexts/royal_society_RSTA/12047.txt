® Observations of the variations undergone by the spectrum of a single element
Esubjected to changes of temperature, led me to make an investigation of the spectra
Aof different strata of the sun’s atmosphere. The considerations which made me hope
for help in this quarter were stated as follows :—‘ Whatever be the chemical nature
of this atmosphere, it will certainly be hotter at the bottom—that is, near the photo-
sphere—than higher up. Hence, if temperature plays any part in moulding the
conditions by which changes in the resulting spectrum are brought about, the
spectrum of the atmosphere close to the photosphere will be different from that of any
higher region, and, therefore, from the general spectrum of the sun, which practically
gives us the summation of all the absorptions of all the regions from the top of the
atmosphere to the bottom.
“ Now, as a matter of fact, we have the opportunity, when we observe the spectrum

of a sun spot or a prominence, of determining the spectrum of a practically isolated
mass of vapours in the hottest region open to our inquiries, and seeing whether it is
like or unlike the general spectrum of the sun. What then are the facts?.....
The whole character of the spectrum of iron, for instance, is changed when we pass
from the iron lines seen among the Fraunhofer lines to those seen among the spot and
prominence lines; a complex spectrum is turned into a simple one, the feeble lines
