Thus, double plates, composed of silver and gold,
(metals which have been supposed to differ very little in their
powers of conducting electricity, ) produced GarLvanic action,
when placed in contact, in the common order, with cloths
moistened in diluted nitric acid. And copper and silyer acted
powerfully with nitrate of mercury. These facts induced me to suppose, that the alternation of
two metallic bodies with fluids, was essential to the production
of accumulated GaLvanic influence, only s0 far as it furnished
two conducting surfaces of different degrees of oxidability ; and
that this production would take place, if single metallic plates
could be connected together by different fluids, in such a man-
ner that one of their surfaces only should undergo oxidation,
the arrangement being regular. On this supposition, I made a number of experiments on dif-
ferent arrangements of single metals and fluids; and, after many
various processes, I was enabled to ascertain, that many of these
arrangements could be made active, not only when oxidations,
but likewise when other chemical changes were going on in
some of their parts. In describing the different GaLvAnic combinations formed by
single metallic plates and fluids, I shall divide them into three
classes, following, in the arrangement, the order of time with
regard to discovery.
