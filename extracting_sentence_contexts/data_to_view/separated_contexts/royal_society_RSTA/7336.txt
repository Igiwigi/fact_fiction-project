In the latter, the motion is markedly
asymmetrical in character, consisting of distinct finite-amplitude wave patterns in the
transverse direction. With a fixed heating system at the base the transition from the low-
to the high-rotation régimes occurs when the angular velocity of the dishpan attains a
certain critical value and the change in the nature of the flow takes place rapidly at this
value. The experiment acquires considerable interest, due to the fact that there are marked
similarities between the high-rotation régime and observed flows of the earth’s atmosphere. In the present paper only the symmetrical forced flow will be discussed. It is convenient
first of all to deal with the problem of zero rotation in order to establish a method of attack
which exploits the fact that the fluid is shallow.
