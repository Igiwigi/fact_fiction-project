Now the analogy between such a substance and ice fails in this
Srespect; in the viscous mass the short diagonal of the square sfretches to the long one
2of the lozenge, but, in the glacier, the ice breaks at right angles to the tension, and
EZ marginal crevasses are formed. It was by means of the simple diagram here sketched
that Mr. Horkxixs showed why the marginal creyasses of a glacier are inclined towards
Sits source*. This fact, therefore, 80 far as it goes, is also opposed to the idea of
BZ viscosity. £2 But it is known that in the case of a substance confessedly viscous, a sudden shock or
strain may produce fracture. Professor FokBrs justly urges, © that sealing wax at mode-
Arate atmospheric temperatures, will mould itself (with time) to the most delicate inequal-
ties of the surface on which it rests . . . . .
