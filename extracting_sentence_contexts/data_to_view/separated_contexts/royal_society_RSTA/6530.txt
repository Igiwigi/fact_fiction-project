It thus appears that, if the hoop is cut out of sheet copper
‘Zinstead of wire, that part which forms the upper bar should be bounded by two
§hyperbolas of such dimensions that the width at the ends of the cross bar is the same
3 8 as that of the side pieces, which are uniform. If the metal is chosen of such a thick-
Fa s ness, ¢, that the best section of the sides hereafter to be found =¢ X ‘1 mm., then
£ ® the error due to the inclination of the stream lines already pointed out will pts be
appreciable, except within about 4 mm. on either side of the axis. It will be well at
once to point out that the value of this supposed form for the cross bar does not at
g all lie in the fact that it is the best form, for nothing worth consideration would
a 3 be gained by adopting it, but the reason for bringing it forward is this: the total
8 resistance of either half of the cross bar will be, if the resistance of the same length
F of the wire be called 1,= J'adz=4; the moment of inertia of either half will be,
B if that of the same length of the side be called 1, = fiada=4. That is, not only
A has the best form been found for the cross bar, but the ‘mefiuiente for moment of
inertia and for resistance have at the same time been made identical, and thus all the
expressions found with respect to weight will equally apply with respect to moment
of inertia. It may be objected, since, as already mentioned, the resistance of these parts
close to the axis is greater than is supposed, on account of the inclination of the
stream lines and the consequent concentration of the current in the more direct line,
or again, since the weight of a piece of metal filling the space between two hyperbolas
is infinite, that the solution for the difficulty thus put forward is not correct, and that
any further calculations based upon this result will not be trustworthy.
