occupied by left thymus IV in specimen A. It measures 5°5 X 2mm, The
involution-changes are well marked. The gland is penetrated by fatty tissue, and
the fibrous connective tissue, especially in relation to the blood-vessels, is markedly
increased. The thymus tissue is diffuse and broken up into larger and smaller masses
of irregular form. ‘Two imbedded epithelial bodies are present.

The right gland is an oval body, 5 mm. in greatest diameter, situated ventrally
to the right common carotid, about the middle of its length, The main mass of the
gland is here again formed of fibrous connective tissue, with fat-cells. The thymus
tissue is diffuse and scanty in amount. Hassall’s corpuscles are well marked. A
typical imbedded epithelial body is present, and in addition there occurs a smaller
epithelial mass whose ends are not sharply marked off from the adjoining thymus
tissue. The fact that in some of the isolated nodules of thymus tissue the epithelial
cells of the reticulum appear to have undergone hypertrophy suggests that this
mass may have been formed from the reticulum after the withdtawal of the
thymus cells.

Epithelial body 111 on the left side lies dorsally to the internal carotid, shortly in
front of its origi. It measures 2°5 x 2mm. On the right side it lies medially to
the external carotid, and measures 2°5 x 1 mm.

The thyroid resembles that of A, the lobes being slightly larger, the left measuring
14 X 15 mm., and the right 16°55 x 6mm. The bridge passes across between the
fourth and fifth tracheal rings. The thyroid vesicles are here large and spherical,
with thin flattened walls and abundant colloid.
