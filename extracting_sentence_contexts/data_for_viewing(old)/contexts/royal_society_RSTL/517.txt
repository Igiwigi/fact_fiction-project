and Observations on the component Parts of Membrane. g59

of the true nacre or mother of pearl, this substance was found
not only to constitute a large part of the shell, but even to he
more dense, so as no longer to appear gelatinous; and, in addition
to these, strong and visible marks of organization were stamped
on every part, and a perfect membranaceous body remained,
composed of fibres arranged parallel to each other, according to
the configuration of the shells.

From these facts, proved by the examination of only a very
few (comparatively speaking) of the known shells, it appears
that the hardening principle, or carbonate of lime, together
with a substance varying from a very attenuated gluten to a
tough jelly, and from this to a perfectly organized membrane,
concur to form the matter of shell ; and, from the result of the
experiments, and from all circumstances, there is every reason
to believe, that the substance with which, or upon which, the
carbonate of lime is mixed or deposited, is of a similar nature,
and differs only in relative quantity and density, arising from.
progressive changes (peculiar to the various species of shells)
produced by certain degrees of natural inspissation, and by an
organization more or less perfect.
