Clearly we have to do here with a very short primitive streak
(actually about 0-1 mm. in length) which by its proliferative activity has given origin
to the mesoderm which extends back to join the exoccelomic mesoderm. Further, I think we may conclude with reasonable certainty that Husrecut’s “ proto-
chordal wedge ” in Tarsius 86 is not Hensen’s knot but none other than a primitive
streak thickening, probably less developed than in Tarsius 235 but still sufficiently
active to have given origin to a relatively slender mesodermal connecting strand. The
serial sections through Tarsius 86 are definitely oblique to the antero-posterior axis of
the embryonal area, a fact which possibly accounts for the apparent exclusively marginal

origin of the mesoderm in the section figured by Husrecut ; very probably, if a median
reconstruction of the area were made, it would be found to resemble that of Tarsius 235.
