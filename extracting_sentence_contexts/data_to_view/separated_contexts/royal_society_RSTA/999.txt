Note that the kinetics of
polymerization of emulsions was previously investigated by a number of authors (see, among
others, [6-8]). So, for example, the process of emulsion polymerization of vinyl chloride was
investigated by Heiskanen [8] on the basis of evolutionary momentum equations. An important circumstance is the fact that within a certain temperature range the process of
nucleation and growth of crystallites from a metastable polymer liquid occurs simultaneously
with the polymerization process [9-12]. Note that in many cases the latent heat of crystallization
is comparable with the heat of polymerization [9]. In such processes, the effect of polymerization
can become decisive.
