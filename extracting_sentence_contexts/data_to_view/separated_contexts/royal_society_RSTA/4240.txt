The examples above raise the question of whether two objective structures, each generated as the
orbit of a single atom position, can meet along an interface with perfect matching of atoms across
the interface. Here we show by examples that this is the case. In fact, the method of construction
here is strictly mathematically analogous to the method used to construct the helical structures
shown in figure 6b. A complete analysis is given in a forthcoming paper [43]. Helical atomistic structures are surprisingly common.
