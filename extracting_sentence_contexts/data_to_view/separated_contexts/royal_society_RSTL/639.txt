10 Sir Humenry Davy on the fire-damp of coal mines, and on

of a higher conducting power connected with its greater
density. The consideration of these various facts, led me to adopt a
form of a lamp, in which the flame, by being supplied with
only a limited quantity of air, should produce such a quantity
of azote and carbonic acid, as to prevent the explosion of the
fire-damp, and which, by the nature of its apertures for giving
admittance and exit to the air, should be rendered incapable
of communicating any explosion to the external air. If in a close lantern, supplied with a small aperture below
and another above, a lighted lamp having a very small wick
be placed, the natural flame gradually diminishes, till it
arrives at a point at which the supply of air is sufficient for
the combustion of a certain small quantity of oil ; if a lighted
taper be introduced into the lantern through a small door in
the side, which is instantly closed, both lights will burn for a
few seconds, and be extinguished together. A similar phenomenon occurs, if, in a close lantern, supplied
with a quantity of air merely sufficient to support a certain
flame, a mixture of fire-damp and air is gradually admitted,
the first effect of the fire-damp is to produce a larger flame
round that of the lamp, and this flame, consuming the oxy-
gene which ought to be supplied to the flame of the lamp,
and the standard of the power of the air to support flame being
lowered by the admixture of fire-damp and by its rarefaction,
both the flame of the fire-damp and that of the taper are extin-
guished together; and as the air contained a certain quantity
of azote and carbonic acid before the admission of the fire-
damp, their effect, by mixing with it, is such as to prevent an
explosion in any part of the lantern.


methods of lighting the mines without producing its explosion. 11

I tried several experiments on the burning of a flame in
atmospheres containing fire-damp.
