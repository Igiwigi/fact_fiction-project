shall probably err on the side of safety if we consider that a fatal dose for an average
man is about 30 milligrammes, as this figure is covered by both the estimates given
above. Assuming the weight of an average man to be about 70 kilos., and the
weight of his blood to be about one-thirteenth of this figure or rather less than
5°5 kilos., and assuming also that the whole dose of venom injected is absorbed into
the circulation, we find that the concentration of the poison solution in the body will
be about 1 : 183,333.

Even if the above calculations are considered to be over-liberal, or if it is objected
that the whole quantity of venom would not be in circulation at one time, we have
still a very wide margin between 1/183,333, the figure we have just arrived at, and
1 : 10,000,000, which has been found to be a sufficiently strong solution to act on the
isolated vessels within an hour. ‘Two additional facts are to be borne in mind, viz.,
that the tissues of a victim of snake bite are exposed to the action of the venom for
many hours, and that it is extremely difficult to dislodge Cobra poison from those
tissues, once it has fastened on to them. In illustration of the last point, it may be
mentioned that isolated vessels or isolated hearts, which have been submitted to long
perfusion with the venom, cannot be recoved by perfusion with a normal fluid ;
farther, if the original venom perfusion has been short, and if recovery under normal
fluid takes place, a second irrigation with the lethal fluid acts much more quickly
and decisively than did the first one.

It is clear, therefore, that the sustained high pressure, which is so marked a feature
of blood-pressure tracings in slow death from cobraism, is explainable without going
any farther than the direct action of the poison on the walls of the vessels. The
