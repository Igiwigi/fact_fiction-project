488 PROF. W. J. SOLLAS ON THE STRUCTURE OF

photographie plates which can be multiplied at will; thus, like the art of printing,
rendering possible a permanent existence which can be ensured by no other means.

The laboriousness of the process has been exaggerated, partly, I fear, by myself,
but when owing to the war I had on one occasion to perform all the work of grinding
down, photographing, and reconstructing the second specimen without assistance, I was
astonished to find that the whole series of operations from start to finish occupied
less than three weeks. When it is considered that this single specimen affords all
the information that has been accumulated by the repeated study of rich collections
by numerous observers, and has even disclosed new and important facts, it becomes
clear that the method is not so laborious as it seems, Further, the greater part
of the work can be performed by comparatively unskilled labour, and finally the
labour expended is recompensed by a certainty which is well worth the pains.

The Skull.—The skull may be compared to a wedge-shaped box, broader and
deeper behind than in front, and with several apertures in the sides. In specimen
No. 1, the length is 20 mm. ; the height, 9°5 mm. ; and the breadth where broadest,
a.e., between the posterior angles formed by the supra-temporal bones, 14 mm. ; in
specimen No, 2 these numbers become respectively 16 mm., 7 mm., and 9mm. If
the roof be regarded as horizontal then the base rises gently forwards from the
basi-occipital bone to the premaxille.
