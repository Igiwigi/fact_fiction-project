Note that there is no canonical normalization for the shadow and we choose ours to simplify

and the fact that the modular difference function associated with g* is again a period integral
completely analogous to (2.16), it follows that mock modular forms indeed lead to quantum
modular forms. Moreover, the quantum modular forms arising from a mock modular form and
the Eichler integral of its shadow are clearly closely related.

However, just as Ramanujan already pointed out in his original work [1], mock modular
forms inevitably encounter infinities when approaching certain rational numbers from within
the upper-half plane. Nonetheless, there exists a finite collection of weakly holomorphic modular
forms that can be used to ‘cut out’ these infinities and render a well-defined radial limit. More
explicitly, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 2.5 ([25,26]). Let f be a mock modular form of weight k and multiplier system x for
IQ(N) with non-vanishing shadow g, and let {x1,...,X:} C QU {ico} be a set of representatives of
