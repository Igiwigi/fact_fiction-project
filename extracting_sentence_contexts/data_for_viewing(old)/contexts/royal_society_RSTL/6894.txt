MR. T. A. HIRST ON THE VOLUMES OF PEDAL SURFACES. 19

In like manner the pedal of a tubular surface would, in general, consist of distinct
sheets which would coincide when the primitive degenerated to a line. Although the
pedal gurface, therefore, still exists when two dimensions of the primitive are supposed
to vanisch—being, in fact, still the envelope of spheres whose diameters are the radii
vectores of the curye—its volume must be regarded as eyanescent.

The case is otherwise, however, when one only of the three dimensions of the primi-
tive is 8upposed to vanish. Such a surface (S') would consist of two coincident sheets,
and would, therefore, enclose no space; to the eye, in fact, it would not be distinguish-
able from some definite portion of an ordinary surface. Its pedal, however, would be
of a compound nature—consisting, irs, of a surface (P') of the same nature as (S'),
undistinguishable to the eye from ,a portion of its ordinary pedal, and, 8&condly, of the
8imple pedal (P) of the curve (C) forming the contour of the primitive (S'). The
volume of the compound pedal, however, would be simply that of the pedal (P) of the
contour (C), This yolume, therefore, properly interpreted, ought to be deducible from
our general formulze.

Tt must be observed, however, that although the form of the pedal of a curve (C) is
inyariable, its volume must be differently estimated according to the nature of the two-
dimensional surface (S') of which the curye is supposed to form the contour. To render
this more evident, it will be convenient to regard the pedal of a curye, not only as the
