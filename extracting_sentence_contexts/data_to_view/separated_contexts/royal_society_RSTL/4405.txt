Mammalia differ from the rest essentially in this, that the lowering of the tempera-

50 that they are reduced for a time to a condition in all respects comparable to that
of cold-blooded animals but little removed above absolute torpidity; and in this
condition, all that has been said respecting the influence of external temperature upon
the rate of life of cold-blooded animals, applies to them also. The vast mass of facts, of which the foregoing are examples, appears to the author
to justify the conclusion, that Heat is something more than a stimulus capable of
