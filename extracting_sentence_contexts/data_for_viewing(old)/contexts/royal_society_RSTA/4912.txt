coupled solar atmosphere (including the chromosphere); and
— coronal heating is intrinsically non-steady.

The complexity of the solar atmosphere and the wide range of both spatial and temporal
scales on which physical processes are observed to occur mean that beyond the above list of
fairly simple facts, much is either not known or not agreed (e.g. Klimchuk’s review [7]). There
is, however, increasing consensus that ‘the’ coronal heating mechanism is unlikely to exist, but
rather coronal heating is due to different mechanisms in different places and/or at different times.
Furthermore, the traditional dichotomy between waves and reconnection is not appropriate, since
there are interactions between these processes (waves may drive reconnection and vice versa);
also turbulence, which may combine aspects of both wave and reconnection scenarios, is likely to
play an important role [9]. Recent work proposing coronal heating through Alfvénic turbulence
[10] has attracted much attention.

It is useful to keep in mind that the solar atmosphere does not only have to be heated but
has to be formed in the first place. In other words, the coronal heating problem does not only
involve an energy cycle but also a mass cycle. In addition, energy is required to accelerate the
solar wind. The way forward lies in combining all aspects of solar physics research: a thorough
