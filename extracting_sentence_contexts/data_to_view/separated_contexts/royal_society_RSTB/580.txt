From this it seems that these calcarine fibres can be traced round beneath the
cortex at the bottom of the calcarine fissure, and that their direction is from the
median line outwards and backwards, and after passing round the fissure they ascend
vertically or obliquely along the inner surface of the posterior ventricular cornu in the
cortex, forming the superior lip of the calcarine fissure (see p. 163), extending forwards
to come into close relation with the cingulum. Having now reached a level below the bottom of the calcarine fissure (fig. 37) there
is a great confusion of fibres, and those from the posterior part of the internal capsule
and the optic radiations of Gratioter have begun to merge with the central white
matter of the convolution which formed the inferior lip of the calcarine fissure, on the
median aspect of the occipital lobe, fig. 38, C.R. In fact here the part of the occipital lobe on the outside of the calcarine fissure and
of the lateral ventricle is merged with the part of the occipital lobe which is below
that fissure. :

The fibres of the cingulum still have the appearance of being cut across, and sub-
sequently the most internal fibres of the hinder part of the internal capsule, which,
in previous sections proceeded to the extreme posterior part of the occipital convolu-
tions, now turn sharply round the lateral ventricle into the neighbourhood of the
cingulum. This is owing to the fact that we have now reached a level near to the
inferior surface of the occipital lobe, which, as we shall see further on, disappears
altogether from the sections. At the same time the posterior cornu of the lateral
ventricle gradually becomes shorter, receding from behind forwards, till at this level
it does not extend farther back than the cingulum, in fact it almost ceases to exist as
such.
