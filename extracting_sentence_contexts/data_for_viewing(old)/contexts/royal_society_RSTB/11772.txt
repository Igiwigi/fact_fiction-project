1. Origin and regulation of motor rhythms

Neurons and neural circuits with intrinsic oscillatory activities underlie rhyth-
micity of motor behaviours, from respiration, heartbeat, gastric motility to
locomotion [1-5]. In the absence of rhythmic inputs from the descending
neural networks or sensory organs, isolated vertebrate spinal cords, and their
invertebrate counterpart, the ventral nerve cords, retain a capacity to generate
rhythmic and patterned motor neuron activity or fictive locomotion [6-10].
Hence oscillators for locomotory activities reside within the spinal or ventral
nerve cords, where premotor interneurons form local circuits with excitatory
motor neurons to orchestrate motor outputs [1,2,11].

Selective recruitment, modulation and coordination of locomotory oscillators
constitute the form and transit between different motor patterns. This process is
regulated at multiple levels. Within the spinal cords of rodents and fish, distinct
