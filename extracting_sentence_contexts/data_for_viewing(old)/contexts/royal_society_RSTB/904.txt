Connnem showed that the white cells of the blood could penetrate the walls of the

sod capillaries, and so pass to an inflamed area. Thus, the first step was taken
wards defining the morphological position of the wandering cells as an independent
rtion of the body.
The fact that the wandering cells ingest discrete particles has long been known.
‘aus, Scuutze, Haxcken, Hoek, and others described the process as occurring in
th Vertebrates and Invertebrates. But the genius of MrrscHNniKorr® first
ggested the importance of this process to the body. He showed that ingestion was,
the case of bacteria and digestible ingesta generally, followed by digestion. This
scovery enabled MrrscuNikorr to attain to some conception of the real significance
fie inflammatory process, and the part the wandering cells play therein.
While Merscunikorr was working at this question, startling additions were being
to our knowledge of the life-history of vegetable micro-organisms and the part
play in disease. The enormous importance of his discoveries, as suggesting an
Seaton of the resistance of animals to the invasion of these bodies, became at
® obvious, and Merscuy1Korr was led to formulate a theory of the immunity of
iGials in which the resistance to the disease germs is referred solely to the
