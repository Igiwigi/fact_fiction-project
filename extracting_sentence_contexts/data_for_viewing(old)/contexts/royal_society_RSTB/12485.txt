alist or specialist strategies, with respect to resource acquisition
and utilization at least. The large variations in the number of
pathways within phyla are most likely a reflection of differences
in evolutionary processes that occur in soil bacteria. In some
cases, there was less variation in the number of pathways
within phylogenetic class, particularly within the Proteobac-
teria, but large variation still remained (electronic
supplementary material, figure S2). We did not analyse the
data for differences among classes as many of the classes did
not have a sufficient number of entries for statistically reliable
results. Similarly, we did not have a sufficient number of entries
to analyse the data at the order level. One should of course not
lose sight of the fact that the MetaCyc database is based on the
sequenced genomes of isolated bacteria and therefore may give
a biased picture, even though the relative abundances of phyla
in the database appear to be reasonably representative. Further-
more, the pathways in the database are limited to those that are
known and the true picture may very well be different from the
one shown here.

There were similarities in the types of pathways within
phyla (figure 1). Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, in particu-
lar, had slightly different sets of pathways compared with
each other and with the other phyla. The fact that the degra-
dation/utilization/assimilation pathways are not distributed
