diminishing rate for some days. The ends and beginnings of storms were represented
by a larger proportion of the 33 than of the 209 days. One of the 33 days showed
an n.e. change of +140y.

In the case of D what the absolute observations suggested was not a real
instrumental drift, but occasional small discontinuities due probably to movements of
iron in the building. Jn the case of H there is confirmatory evidence from the base
line values that the instrumental creep is in the direction simulating a fall of force,
but they suggest —15y per annum as a more probable estimate than —5y as found
above. In the case of V the instrumental creep in reality seems to fluctuate in
direction. When a sensible change of sensitiveness occurred in the course of the
year, the tendency to creep seemed more apparent. On individual ordinary days the
n.c. change in V is mainly a temperature effect. This may in fact be recognised in
the figures given in Table TV. The four months April to July include most of the
summer rise of temperature in the magnetograph room, the principal part of the
annual fall taking place in the four months September to December. The mean daily
n.c. changes during these two groups of months are by Table IV. :

From April to July —2°00y.
,, September to December +1°32y,

The two means will naturally include equal or approximately equal contributions from
any regular source of drift which is independent of temperature, such for instance as
might arise from gradual weakening of the magnet. If we ascribe the difference
between the two four months’ means obtained above solely to temperature, and take
