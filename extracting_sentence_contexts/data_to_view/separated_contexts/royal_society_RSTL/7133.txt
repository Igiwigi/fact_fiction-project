These properties are (as will be shown) deducible from a
general formula in my ** Memoir on the Automorphic Linear Transformation of a Bipar-
tite Quadric Function,” Phil. Trans. vol. cxlviii. (1858), pp. 39-46 ; but the particular
case in question is an extremely interesting one, the theory whereof is worthy of an
independent investigation. For convenience the number of variables is taken to be four ;
but it will be at once seen that as well the demonstrations as the results are in fact
applicable to any even number whatever of variables. Article Nos. 1 & 2.—Notation and Remarks.
