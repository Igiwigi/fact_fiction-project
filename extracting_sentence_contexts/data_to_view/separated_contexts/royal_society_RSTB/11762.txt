Intuitively, the Sahni algorithm
instances do not rely on a particular computational model works as follows. Firstly, it computes all subsets of items of
or algorithm. The fact that it has been possible to relate com- cardinality k that can be formed from the set of available
putational resource requirements of instances to particular items. Then it considers each of these subsets and uses the
properties of instances indicates that computational complex- greedy algorithm to fill the remainder of the knapsack to
ity may be an inherent feature of instances and, by extension, capacity. The greedy algorithm selects items in the reverse
classes of computational problems, as opposed to a feature of order of their value-to-weight ratio and terminates once the
a particular computational model [46]. knapsack has reached capacity.
