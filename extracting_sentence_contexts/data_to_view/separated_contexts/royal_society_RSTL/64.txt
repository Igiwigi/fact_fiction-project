in the Skin expos'd to our ſight, there wou'd, in my O-

tor if a Blow or Thruſt were made upon that part
where the Yalve. lies, .the Blood would not be able to
retire back, by which means the Valve or even the Vein
it ſelf might burſt : whereas, if there-are no Valves, the
Blood can eaſily retreat upwards or downwards in the
Veins, as we, in FaCt, obſerve of thoſe Veins that run *
on both ſides in the Tail-Fins of an Eel, which ds not
unite in one greater Vein where a Valveis, at leaſt as far -
we cou'd follow thoſe Veins with our Eyes. : Having thus far committed theſe my Obſervations to |

have ſomething of this nature lying by me, having for |
merly conſider*d this Subjett of Eels ; and I find amongſt *
other Papers, theſe thar follow. |
