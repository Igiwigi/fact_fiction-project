<* Notes ” of these desired facts, with indications of the times and places most likely to

after the lapse of thirty years, I have been fayoured with materials for making s0me
further adyance in this interesting physiological problem—a small one, it is true, but
such as seemed to me worthy of being submitted to the Society as an addition to former
records on the subject contained in the Philosophical Transactions. For these materials I am indebted to my friend the accomplished botanist, Dr. FeR-
DINAND MUELLER, F.R.S., of Melbourne, Australia., 'They consist of a female Zchidna
(Ornithorhynehus Hystriz of Home, Echidna Hystriz of Cuvier, the © Porcupine Ant-
eater” of the colonists) and her young one, or one of her young, which was observed,
as the captor supposed, suspended to a nipple when the animal was first 8ecured, After
five days' confinement the young was found detached and dead, was put into a bottle of
Spirits, and, with the mother still living, was transmitted from © Colac Forest,” Victoria,
the place of capture, to Melbourne.
