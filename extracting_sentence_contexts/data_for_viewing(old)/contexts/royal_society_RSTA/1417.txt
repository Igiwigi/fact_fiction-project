intense CanWE#3 and #5 (triggering most annual maximum hourly rainfall) show an increasing
relative frequency during the recent years from 2009, albeit care is needed about this recent rise
due to smaller sample sizes in recent years (figure 1d).

4. Discussion and concluding remarks

In this study, we used a new empirical approach to analyse the statistical characteristics of all
WEs including extreme rainfall. Instead of looking at the spatially fixed values of the daily or
subdaily rainfall extremes, we considered here the full sequence of wet hours shaping WEs from
their start to their end. In other words, considering WEs may be interpreted as a ‘Lagrangian’
approach, of time varying (here hourly) localized rainfall. This may complement the classical
‘Eulerian’ approach considering both the spatial and temporal variability of daily or subdaily
rainfall, including their extremes. In fact, characteristics of the WEs are not fully independent of
spatial location, since orography, distance from the coast, and orientation of the slopes versus
moisture flow will significantly impact on their duration as well as the occurrence of daily and
subdaily extremes. We however hypothesize from figure 5 that the six canonical WEs are likely
to cover a distinctive and robust set of different ‘Lagrangian’ archetypal WEs, which are likely to
hold across broader regions at least in the tropical zone.

The dynamical interpretation of the CanWEs may be based on their temporal profiles (mostly
figures 4 and 6 here), their seasonality (figure 7) as well as their spatial extent inferred from
IMERG (figures 8 and 9). As expected from the nearly inverse exponential CDF of daily or hourly
amounts, the most frequent WEs (i.e. CanWE#1) are related with very short and nominal rainfall.
