Experimentally, it is found that at vertical incidence, | R,, | decreases slightly with in-
crease of frequency under night-time conditions. The theory does not predict this decrease;
for at vertical incidence | R,, | = | p,,| tends asymptotically with frequency to the value of
0-5 (see (9-1)). This lack of agreement can be accounted for either by assuming, as suggested
in § 1, that there is an absorbing region at a level below those considered in this paper, or
by the fact that there is a slight effect in region IT caused by the collision frequency; but
the approximations needed for the two regions to separate demand that this collision fre-
quency should be neglected.* For vertical incidence only, Stanley (1950) has given the
complete solution for the case of an exponential variation of electron density with height,
and his formulae show there is no asymptotic approach to the value 0:5 provided the
collision frequency is sufficient. Experimentally, the apparent height corresponding to R,, is known within 5km to be
the same for 16 and 80kc/s as measured at a distance of 90km. For angles of incidence up
to 65° on 16kc/s, the apparent height is constant, but for angles greater than 65° results
cannot be obtained, due to the multiple reflexion of waves and to fading.
