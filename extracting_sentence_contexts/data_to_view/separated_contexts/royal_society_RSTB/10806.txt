Hence, these manipulated experiments
show that clones possess particular phenotypic characteristics
and that they may dominate under a specific set of con-
ditions, but as environmental conditions change, the clonal
dominance will change. The suite of differentiated pheno-
typic properties intrinsic to the constituent clones would
likely be of benefit for the population. The response of a
diatom population to stress and how effectively it can
handle short-term disturbances may in fact depend on the
level of genetic and phenotypic diversity. A constant but
varying external selection pressure in a highly dynamic
environment would serve to maintain phenotypic diversity
within the population. So far, only abiotic factors have been discussed as drivers
of diatom species or population phenotypic variability.
