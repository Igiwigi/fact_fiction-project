At the focus of the electric lamp, not only ether, but alcohol and water are
speedily caused to boil, while bisulphide of carbon, whose boiling-point is only 48? C.,
cannot be raised to ebullition. In fact exposure for a period sufficient to boil alcohol
or water is scarcely sufficient to render bisulphide of carbon sensibly warm. If any one point came out with more clearness than any other in my experiments on
gases, liquids, and yapours, it was the paramount influence which chemical constitution
exerted upon the phenomena of radiation and absorption. And seeing how little the
character of the radiation was affected by the change of a body from the state of vapour
to the state of liquid, I held it to be exceedingly probable that even in the solid state
chemical constitution would exert its power.
