GRAVITATIONAL STABILITY OF THE EARTH. 217

PART. I.

A Past State of Gravitational Instability as a Reason for the existing Distribution
of Land and Water.

44, Although the conclusion reached by Juans (1903), that a spherical planet of
the same size, mass and elasticity as the Earth, in its present state, would be in
a condition of gravitational stability, is confirmed and strengthened by the present
anvestigation, it by no means follows that the Earth has always been in such a state
@s it is now. The fact that the mean density of the Earth as a whole is greater than

e average density of surface rocks points to a concentration of mass towards the
Bentre, and suggests that such a concentration may have come about through the
Blasticity having once been too small for a homogeneous state to be stable. We have
‘geen that this would have been the case if the modulus of compression was once as
Small as, or smaller than, that of glass. But we also saw reason to think that, if the
Bean modulus of compression was once decidedly less than that of glass, spherically
symmetrical states of aggregation would also have been unstable, and the body would
Have existed in some other state. Further, we saw that, if the body was at rest, the
‘tate in which it would have existed is that which we have described as a state of
Bateral disturbance with a hemispherical distribution of density. The excess of
-Mensity in one hemisphere and defect in the antipodal hemisphere would have existed
