losophical Transactions.

I formerly considered the warmthr of natural and artificial
clothing, as depending principally on the obstacle it opposes to
the motions of the cold air by which the hot body is surrounded ;
but, by a patient and careful examination of the subject, I have
been convinced, that the efficacy of radiation is much greater than
I had supposed it to be.

From the result of the experiment No. g1, we might be led
to conclude, that a very small part only of the heat which a hot
body appears to lose when it is cooled'in air, is in fact commu-
nicated to that fluid; a much greater portion of it being com-
municated to other surrounding bodies at a distance; and, in
one of my former experiments, a hot body was cooled, though it
was placed in a ToRRICELLIAN vacuum,


150 Count RUMrorD's Enquiry concerning the Nature of Heat,

These researches appear to me to be the more interesting, as
I have long been of opinion, that it must be by experiments of
this kind, (showing. in what manner the temperature of bodies :
are affected reciprocally, at different degrees of temperature, and
