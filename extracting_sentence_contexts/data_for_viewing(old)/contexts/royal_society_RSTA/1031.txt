Subject Areas: these transitions are stacked for a long time in
Materials science, mathematical modelling, non-equilibrium states that appear due to either
biophysics, chemical physics, microsystems, macroscopic dissipative processes (an alternating
statistical physics magnetic field or hydrodynamic flow, for instance) or

system lifetime in a metastable state. It is important
to explain and describe these transitional states
using the general approach of non-equilibrium
physical mechanics. The review and research articles
