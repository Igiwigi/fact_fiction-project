706 PROFESSOR HARLEY ON THE INFLUENCE OF

Nicotine.

Various experiments were performed with nicotine, and it was invariably found to
produce the same result; namely, to retard the normal oxidation processes in blood,
and at the same time to diminish the exhalation of carbonic acid. The following expe-
riment may be quoted as an illustration of the fact.

Two portions (62 grammes) of defibrinated ox-blood, after being thoroughly arte-
rialized, were placed in receivers with 100 per cent. of atmospheric air, and both were
treated during twenty-four hours exactly alike, except that to one was added 6 drops of
chemically pure nicotine.
