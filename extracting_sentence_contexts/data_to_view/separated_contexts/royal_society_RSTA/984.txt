An increase in Bi concentration in hypoeutectic Sn-Bi alloys increases the thickness of the
lamellae, decreases the lamellar spacing and increases the fraction of coarse equiaxed precipitates. The similarity of these microstructures with those of Sn-20wt.% Bi allows us to conclude
that the solidification has also resulted in a supersaturated solid solution, followed by the
discontinuous precipitation in two stages at room temperature. This assumption is confirmed.
by the fact that the concentration in the microstructures of A- and B-types is equal to the
initial (nominal) concentration for all rapidly quenched alloys (cooling rate approx. 10Â°Ks~!). Hypo- and hypereutectic alloys usually solidify by a dendritic primary phase and interdendritic
eutectic. The chemical composition of each structural constituent is, in the near-equilibrium case,
the concentration of the respective phase or phase mixture in the equilibrium phase diagram.
