in short, started with bondmakers, went on to copymakers and finally gave origin to codemakers.

Molecular biology, in short, has discovered that genes and proteins require not only catalysts
but also templates. The catalysts join the subunits together, and the templates provide the order
in which the subunits are assembled. It is that order that determines biological specificity, and in
proteins that order comes from messenger RNAs, i.e. from external molecules.

This is precisely the characteristic that divides spontaneous molecules from molecular
artefacts. In spontaneous molecules, the order of the components comes from within the molecules, :
from internal factors, whereas in genes and proteins it comes from without, from external templates. =
This amounts to saying that a molecular system becomes a ‘maker’ when it starts using 3
templates in the production of objects. The difference between spontaneous and manufactured
molecules, in short, is a reality because it is an experimental fact that genes and proteins are nee)
template-dependent objects. :

This makes us realize that the physicalist thesis is wrong because it is only spontaneous a]
processes that are completely described by physical quantities. The same applies to Yockey’s DN
argument: it is true that linear, digital and specific properties do not exist in spontaneous [o
processes, but they do exist in all manufacturing processes, including those that are produced [&
by molecular machines at the molecular level. ,

When a copymaker scans a nucleic acid and makes a copy of that molecule, what happens
is precisely an operation that brings into existence a linear and digital copy of a pre-
existing molecule. It was molecular copying—the simplest form of artefact-making—that started
manufacturing biological objects and set in motion the odyssey of life on the primitive Earth.
