240 R. V. SOUTHWELL AND L. CHITTY ON THE PROBLEM OF HYDRODYNAMIC

the aid of these relations we could not have established that the %°s were necessarily
real, or that their real parts were negative ; neither could we have justified RayLEicH’s
approximate method for their calculation. These questions are accordingly still open
in relation to the general case of our problem. :

Had the non-energetie terms not been present, OsBorNE REyNoLps’ investigation
would have had a real bearing on the question of stability ; in fact, it would have
constituted an ordinary application of the method of normal co-ordinates (cf. § 6).
Actually (since the ’ which he inserts in (27) has an arbitrarily chosen distribution)
it must be regarded as an application of RayLEercu’s method (§ 9) in circumstances
where this method cannot be justified as a method of approximate calculation, because
the conjugate relations do not hold.

Similar objections apply to any extension of ReyNoups’ method on the lines described
in Section I, § 12, if its results are regarded as an answer to the question of stability.
For the values of “ 2” (denoted by —q in Section I) are there deduced from distribu-
tions of ¥ which do not satisfy the correct normal equation (25), but the modified
equation (26).
