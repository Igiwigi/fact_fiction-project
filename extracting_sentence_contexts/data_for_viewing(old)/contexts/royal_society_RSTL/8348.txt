The inquiry is divided into three sections. The first section is devoted to the
examination of the conditions under which organic liquids and mixtures are rendered
barren by heat. In the second section is investigated the question whether the normal

Juices and tissues of animals and plants are capable of producing organisms without
infection by extraneous germs. In the third section the facts adduced in the two
previous sections are considered in their bearing on the origin of Bacteria and Torule,
and some of the alleged cases of abiogenesis are tested experimentally.

The experiments were all contrived on a plan which fayoured not only the birth but
the continuous growth of any organisms which made their appearance. The materials
were both maintained at a suitable temperature and furnished with a free supply of
air, s0 that the changes initiated might have an opportunity of going on until their
nature became undoubted.

In judging of the absence or presence of organisms, the microscope was, of course, the
principal test. The magnifying-power generally employed was 500 diameters, controlled
sometimes by a magnifying-power of 1200 diameters. In addition to this, however,
