5-8.) In properly stained specimens they are frequently very conspicuous, as the figures
show, and are oval or spheroidal, and may exhibit a distinction into nucleus and
nucleolus (fig. 9). Ihave been unable to satisfy myself of the existence of definite
chromosomes, but the fact that nuclear division may be accompanied by the well-
known figures (see fig. 25) suggests their existence. Delicate staining with alum
hematoxylin, saffranin, or diamant-fuchsin and licht-griin always bring these nuclei out
sharply, and their regular co-existence in pairs in the terminal clavate segments of
the older hyphze, which are mobilising beneath the epidermis to form spore-layers, is
very striking (fig. 10). It may be added that the variations in colour produced by the fuchsin-green
method, seen on comparing, e.g., figs.
