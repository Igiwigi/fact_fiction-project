However,
when relatedness between interacting partners is higher,
some simulations reach an alternative equilibrium (green
points in figure 5b,c). The levels of help and aggression in
this alternative equilibrium are very similar to the levels
evolved under high relatedness in the unresponsive case
(figures 3 and 5d). They both differ from the negotiated com-
promise by exhibiting lower levels of help and aggression; in
fact, in both cases breeders do not show aggression at all. The ‘kin-selected’ equilibrium, unveiled by high levels of
relatedness, is the same equilibrium obtained in the unre-
sponsive case (figure 3). Both sets of simulations are
characterized not only by lower levels of help and the
absence of aggression, but also by flat reaction norms: the
interacting partners are unresponsive (figure 5e).
