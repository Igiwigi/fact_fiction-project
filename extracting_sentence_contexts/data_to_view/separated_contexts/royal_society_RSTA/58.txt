Thus it might be held that stability must subsist in the figures of equilibricm until the two masses

come into contact. But, as appears from ยง 11, it is certain that, if one of the masses be smaller than the
other, this cannot be the case. In fact, the investigation must break down on account of the imperfection
arising from the use of spherical harmonic analysis. i We have seen that the infinite determinant, which gives the coefficients of stability, splits into two
parts when we rely on spherical harmonic analysis; but when instability ensues it must be brought
about by the joint action of the tidai and rotational forces. It appears certain then that, if a rigorous
analysis were used, this separation would not take place.
