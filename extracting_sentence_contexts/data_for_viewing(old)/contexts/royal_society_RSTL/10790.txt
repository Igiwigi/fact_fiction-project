Se found in the fact that liquid eylinders offer such much greater facilities for

Sbtaining a completely black film than any other geometrical form, that every other

ereafter, we conceive to be of prime importance.

Tn the following pages we shall deduce from the aesumption that films of different
thicknesses bave different surface tensions the conclusions to which it leads, and shall
then 8ubmit to the test of experiment the question as to whether these conclusions are
in accord with the observed facts.

On the Sensitiveness of the Methods of measuring Changes in the Surface Tension
of a Film.

All the methods which we have described measure the change in the surface tension
of the film indirectly by a change in length. In PLateav's experiment the move-
