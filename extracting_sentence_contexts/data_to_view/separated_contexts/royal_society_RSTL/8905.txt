Prior to the date here referred to, great public interest had been excited, and, T may
add, considerable scientific uncertainty had been produced in reference to this subject,
both in England and America, by the writings of Dr. BasTiaN. These writings consisted,
in part, of theoretic considerations and reflections, not new, but sometimes very ably
stated, based on the general doctrine of Eyolution, and, in part, of yery pungent criti-
cixgms of those who, though believers in Evolution, declined to accept the writer's
programme of its operations*. Passing over both theory and criticism, I thought it
wise to fix upon certain well-defined statements of fact which lay at the basis of the
weighty superstructure raised by their author, and to bring these statements to the test
of strict experiment. 'Thus it was affirmed * that boiled turnip- or hay-infusions exposed to ordinary air,
expoxed to filtered air, to calcined air, or shut off altogether from contact with air, are
more or less prone to swarm with Bacteria and Vibriones in the course of from two
to 8ix days”. I resorted accordingly to filtered air, calcined air, and to infusions with-
drawn from air, but failed to discover the alleged © proneness ” to run into living forms.
