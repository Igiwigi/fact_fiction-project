We find the magnetic force producing, by
processes which are evidently similar, two great classes of effects. We have a certain
number of bodies which are attracted by the magnet, and a far greater number which
are repelled by the same agent. Supposing these facts to have been known to
Amrzre, would he bave satisfied his profound mind by founding a theory which
accounts for only the smaller portion of them ? This theory is admirable as far as it
goes, but the generalization is yet to come which shall show the true relationship of
phenomena, towards whose connexion the theory of AMeERE furnisbes at present no
apparent clue. ?
