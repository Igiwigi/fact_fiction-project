It follows that
cells are capable of a considerably higher rate of cell division than they normally develop,
and also that they are capable of maintaining this great activity unchecked over long
periods. Indeed, in cancerous growths it appears that the highest rate of mitotic activity
may be continued indefinitely. Exhaustion, therefore, cannot be considered the basis of
regulation, and, in fact, it would appear peculiar if such a potentially dangerous process
as cell division was not subject to some rigid control of a more positive nature. It is possible
that mitosis regulation is achieved by the production of antihormone substances for it has
been suggested that every hormone may have a controlling inhibitor. Already, for instance,
antigonadotrophic, antithyrotrophic, and antithyroid hormones are known (see reviews
by Collip, Selye & Thomson 1940; Thompson 1941).
