Sea-level reconstructions used to infer ice volume changes through the Cenozoic have been
developed using sequence stratigraphy backstripping from several continental margins [6,7,15].
This technique progressively removes the influence of sediment supply, tectonic subsidence and
compaction on local water depth changes in order to extract the eustatic component. However, in
most cases the effect of glacio-hydro-isostatic adjustments and mantle dynamics [16-19], which
may exert a significant influence that overwhelms a purely eustatic signal at any single site,
largely remain unknown [6,14,20].

The deep-sea sedimentary record has also been used to derive a history of past ice
sheet behaviour from the oxygen isotope (5'5O) composition of benthic marine microfossils
(foraminifera) (figure 2). Because ice sheets preferentially incorporate isotopically light oxygen
(!6O) from the ocean during periods of glacial expansion, the oceans become enriched in BO,
relative to !O [3,21,22]. However, this relationship is complicated by the fact that the 5'%O
signature preserved in marine microfossils also contains a component representing the water
temperature in which the carbonate was precipitated, with heavier isotopic values reflecting
