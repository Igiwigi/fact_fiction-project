There is, however,
no means of verifying experimentally the theoretical conclusions other than by the
measurement of strains. Agreement between the measured and theoretical diametral
extension, for instance, would be strong evidence of the existence of the stress distribu-
tion assumed. Unfortunately, a difficulty is introduced in the calculation of the strains
by the fact, to which attention was drawn by Turner, that although in an overstrained
cylinder axial strain will remain constant over the cross-section, it does not follow, as
in the case of a completely elastic cylinder, that the axial stress will also be constant. Tf the cylinder is partially overstrained the axial strain must necessarily be uniform over
the outer portion, which remains elastic. Its magnitude, however, depends on that
in the overstrained portion.
