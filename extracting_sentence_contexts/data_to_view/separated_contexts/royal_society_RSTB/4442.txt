This ventral completion of the vascular ring
would begin at the micropylar end (which would be the first to become free) and
gradually extend towards the chalaza as the ovule was tilted up. At an inclination
of about 45° a condition would be reached not very unlike that actually seen in
Acmopyle. It is now easy to see the significance of the fact—which at first was
rather puzzling—that there is no direct connection, at the chalazal end of the seed of
Acmopyle, between the strands on the ventral side and those on the dorsal (see p. 275
and text-fig. 20),

The next stage, shown in text-fig. 38, d, is hypothetical, and shows the presence of
such a connection in the final phase of erection. The stage shown in text-fig. 38, b, is
also hypothetical. Arguing in the reverse direction—that is, if the seed of Acmopyle is regarded as
more primitive than that of Podocarpus—one would expect that, as the ovule
gradually became more and more inclined and its mid-ventral surface became fused to
the “stalk,” the vascular strands on that side would tend to become atrophied, for
they would be superfluous in the proximity of the ascending strands of the “stalk.”
This atrophy would naturally begin at the chalazal end, and gradually work its way
towards the micropyle.
