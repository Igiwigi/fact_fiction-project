of sensation. The entire absence of reaction, however, observed in some of the preceding experi-
ments, where the hippocampal region was completely destroyed, is a strong proof of the
abolition of sensation, when it is considered that reaction was lively and marked on the
opposite side of the body at the same time. But the loss of tactile sensation is eyen more conclusively indicated by the fact that
monkeys in whom the hippocampal region was destroyed ceased to use the opposite
limbs for the purposes of prehension or the exercise of the faculty of touch.
