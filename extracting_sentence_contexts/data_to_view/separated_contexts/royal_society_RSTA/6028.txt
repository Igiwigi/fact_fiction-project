Namely, the E, field originates
from the density perturbation. The downward convection of E x B shear layers accompanied by
the pressure corrugation may play a role in accumulating the density perturbation in the outer
region, which becomes again the origin of zonal flows. In fact, the increase of the E, shear in the
outer region is observed in higher input power regime, which reduces transport and then shortens
the global scale length. Another possible effect is the edge boundary condition. Here, we used a
Dirichlet type boundary condition to model the outflow of the heat flux from the boundary.
