brings (5.25) to a series of the same form in which the coefficient of z’, is not zero.
Suppose then that c, 4 0. From (6.2) we can express 2, as a power series in ¢, Us, 0;
and hence K may be expressed as a power series in ¢, us, ¥, with coefficients linear in
(« — v); the identity (6.1) then implies that ~, disappears identically from this series,
2.e., we have
K = (c — v) ¢ + Av — Jadg?/e.? + ...

= K’ (4, 0,6 — v) say.

We now investigate the equilibrium solutions of (5.21), to which, as we have seen,
