water than was that of the largest segment, its actual number of contractions in a given

time was just about equal to that of the largest, segment. Again, after transference to-
ſresh sea-water, the balance began to fall on the side of the larger segments; for even

the quadrant, which in the stale water had ceased its motions altogether, now held a
middle position between that of the half-segment and the prepotent eighth-part
segment. On the next day, again, the balance fell decidedly in favour of the larger
segments, and the weaker eighth-part segment died. Lastly, next day all the smaller
segments were dead.

Hence the principal facts to be gathered from these obseryations are, that as time
goes on the rhythm of all the segments progressively decreases, and that the decrease
is more marked in the case of the smaller than in that of the larger segments. This
lesser endurance of the smaller segments also finds its expression in their earlier death.
Now as these s8maller segments started with a greater proportional amount of ganglionic
power than the larger segments, their lesser amount of endurance can only, I think, be
explained by supposing that the process of starvation proceeds at a rate inyersely
proportional to the size of the segment—a supposition which is rendered probable if
we reflect that the smaller the segment the greater is the proportional area of seyered
nutrient-tubes*. And in this connexion it is interesting to observe that, although the
endurance of the smaller segments was less than that of the larger as regards the depri-
vation of nutriment, it was greater than that of the larger segments as regards the
deprivation of oxygen. This is shown by the greater regularity of the rhythm mani-
