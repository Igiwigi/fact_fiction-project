Despite these and other problems, the diagram formalism still suggested that objects of this
nature, if only they could interpreted correctly, embodied the extraordinary possibility of using
just the simplest possible ingredients in complex algebraic geometry, to define a conformally
invariant scheme for fundamental scattering amplitudes. The main advance that was made was
in the application to pure gauge-theoretic scattering, which by 1990 was recognized as the most
fundamental of all. The four-field case was taken far enough to show new interesting features,
with a connection to string theory noticed [7].

In retrospect, these investigations were over-influenced by the objective of finding explicit
compact contours for all channels, defined for finite-normed external fields. It would have been
more productive to concentrate on the formal momentum-space expressions, independent of
channel, which had in fact been introduced in Penrose’s original discussion of twistor diagrams


[5]. These expressions embodied a vital feature—that of manifest gauge invariance. Penrose’s
original Compton scattering diagram showed strikingly that a single diagram could embody a
gauge-invariant expression requiring the summation of two Feynman diagrams in the normal
representation. Exploration of the four-field pure gauge-theory amplitudes had extended this
observation. The extension to more than four fields was attempted and in fact the right expression
written down for five gauge fields, but verification by full summation over Feynman diagrams
seemed too daunting. Only a simplified version of this problem, double Compton scattering, was
pursued [8]. Although, indeed, the manifest gauge invariance of these diagrams was notable,
the very limited range of examples offered too slender a base on which to build a general
picture. Unfortunately, these twistor-theoretic investigations were pursued in ignorance of the
