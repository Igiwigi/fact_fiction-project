12 more nearly continuous in its concavity:
towards the axis than is the similar curve in fig. 11. The differences between these last
two curves have a special interest, on account of the fact that they are entirely due to
alterations in the s0wage of the weights on board, the total amount of weight carried
being the same in both cases. The greatest bending-moment in tig. 12 is found at the
station c &, and amounts to 13,800 foot-tons, or about one-eighth more than it is at the
corresponding station in fig.
