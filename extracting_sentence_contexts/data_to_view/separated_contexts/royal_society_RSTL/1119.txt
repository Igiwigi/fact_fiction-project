That these bold precipices, once projected farther in many
places is easily demonstrated ;, at Beanyn Daana, and at the
Chimney, the columnar construction was obviously once carried
much farther out. At the Mitestone, Portcooan, and Portnabau, the fragments
of dykes extend far beyond the face of the precipice. These same facts, together with the projecting base, shew
that these sudden abruptions were not formed by the subsid-
ing, and -sinking of one part, leaving the remainder in its
place: still less by any violent revolution, or convulsion ; as
the stratification - has not sustained the slightest shock either
above, or below the fagade. The formation of our abrupt coast, has been ascribed to
the action of the sea beating violently against it, washing
away the lower parts, and leaving a perpendicular fagade
standing ; as we often see on the banks of rapid and en-
croaChing rivers. A cool examination of our precipices will s0on prove that

our facades could not have been so formed, for 'we always
find them on the highest part of the cliff, and receding from the
water, which .could be instrumental in bringing down the
materials from above, only by washing, and 80 wearing away
the bases of the steepest parts; but the elevations of these
bases are utterly irreconcileable to this supposition ; for in-
Stance, the base of Pleskin facade is two hundred feet above
the present level of the sea, that of Fairhead three hundred ;
now had the sea ever risen to either height, it would have
submerged a great part of Ireland, and none of the neigh-
bouring country ( whatever its level may be) bears the least
resemblance.
