Another view is that the odontoblast cells really fulfil the function of nerve end
organs. This is the view advocated by Mr. Hoprrwerni-Smrru (4), who, while
allowing that the fact of the odontoblasts being of mesoblastic origin, while the
nerves are developed from the epiblast, makes it impossible to consider them as
ganglion cells, thinks they may still be considered to be sensation transmitters. No nerve fibre has been seen to actually enter an odontoblast cell, although in
teased-out preparations fine varicose fibres can be seen surrounding them (/oe, cit.),
but, in accordance with the neurone theory of WaALDEYER, the interruption of
anatomical continuity would not necessarily cause any interruption in the physio-
logical path, and sensation could be transmitted without the actual continuity of
cell and fibril. Bout (5), as long ago as 1868, in studying this question, employed a 4-per-cent.
