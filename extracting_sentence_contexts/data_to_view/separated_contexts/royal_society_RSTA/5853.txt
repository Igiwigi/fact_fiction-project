See figure 3
for the definitions of the T and B ranges. This result implies that there exists the energy cascade
process due to vortex stretching even in the dissipation range, though the vorticity is attenuated


by the viscosity in the range. In fact, this result is also consistent with the observation (fig. 1c of
[22]) of the energy transfer in the B range. In other words, the number of child vortices in the
cascading process is constant irrespective of the scale in the range (3.2). We have also shown
that L is robust and independent of Reynolds number and forcing (figure 2), which implies
the universality of turbulence.
