over a considerable range of periods, and will not allow the full value of the intensity
to show itself until times which are at least twice as long as the average life of a spot.
Such of the larger spots as come into view at one edge and traverse the whole disc
would furnish a contribution to the periodogram in which the periods corresponding
to half the synodic revolution are absent, provided the area covered by the spot is
constant. We might therefore have expected a specially low value in the intensities
corresponding to periods between 13°5 and 14 days. This is not shown by the tables,
a facet probably accounted for by the great variability of the area of a large spot as
it traverses the disc.

The periodic re-appearance of spots during successive rotations of the sun should
increase the intensity for periods approximating to the average rotation period.
A definite periodicity must not, however, be expected, quite apart from the fact that
the rotation period itself is indefinite. The re-appearance of a phenomenon at regular
intervals of time only constitutes an approximately homogeneous periodic phenomenon
when the re-appearances are sufficiently numerous. With a life of three or four ,
rotations only, there can be little distinction between periodicities ranging from 25 to

29 days.

The comparatively large value of the periodogram (2400) for a period of 13°25 days
deserves some notice. Both in the interval 1890-95 and 1895-1900 there is a very
decided rise of intensity corresponding to that period. But if the periodicity were
real, the phases should be in regular progression. This is not the case, though we
may obtain a better agreement by slightly altering the periodic time to 13296 days.
