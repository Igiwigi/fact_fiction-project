so-called double-opponent cells in the goldfish retina [85]
and in the visual cortex of primates [86]. Because of their
combined spatio-chromatic antagonism, these neurons
should in principle discount the effect of a uniform illumina-
tion across their receptive fields [49]. However, the postulated
invariance of double-opponent cells still awaits confirmation
from physiological studies. Colour-selective neurons in the
optic lobes of honeybees and bumblebees show far more
complex receptive field structures than the typical centre—
surround arrangement as is known from vertebrates. Never-
theless, their combination of spatial and chromatic
antagonism would be equally suitable for the compensation
of overall illumination changes. In fact, centre-surround
receptive fields are not mandatory for achieving colour
constancy. This seems to suggest that the stage of the ‘univer-
sal’ centre-surround neurons, present in the pathways of
primates, has been ‘skipped’ in insects, possibly as a
consequence of streamlining visual processes for efficiency.
