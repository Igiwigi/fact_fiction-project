results differing a little from those of other chemists, who
probably did not take the necessary pains to obtain this acid
in a perfectly pure state,

In conclusion, I wish to observe, that I purposely abstain
at present from making any further observations on the
preceding results than those already given. I do this for
Several reasons: in the first place, such observations will

as these appear to do, cannot be too firmly established ; 1
therefore, in the mean time, earnestly invite chemists in
general to repeat them, and thus either to: confirm them, or
point out their errors ; and for the sake of those who may be
