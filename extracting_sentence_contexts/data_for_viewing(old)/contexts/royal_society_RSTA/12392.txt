5 It is clearly desirable to determine whether these instructions are sufficient to
‘genable different makers to produce cells having the same E.M.F., and to investigate
in what points a slight departure from the instructions may be made without
‘gmaterially affecting the E.M.F. of the cell.
= The following paper contains an attempt to answer the questions :—
S (1.) How far cells made with different samples of materials have the same E.M.F. ?
‘= (2.) How far batches of cells from different makers agree with our standard ?
= (3.) What are the chief sources of variation in a Clark cell ?
We have examined over 100 cells, of which we shall now give the details.
2 The values have generally been given in terms of the cell No. 1, constructed by Lord
? RAYLEIGH over eight years ago.
> The constancy of this cell has been ascertained by comparison with other standards,
Sand by the fact that it was our ultimate standard of reference for the absolute value
Sof the E.M.F. in the investigation already described. The result of this agrees
3 almost exactly with Lord Ray.eicu’s.
& The method of comparison already described in Part I. has been employed in all
3 the later comparisons. Two Leclanché cells are allowed to work through two
& resistance boxes, with a total resistance of 10,000 ohms, in circuit. One of the
Clarks, usually the bottle cell, is connected through a galvanometer and a high
G resistance to two points on this circuit, and the resistances adjusted until the
potential difference between these points just balances the E.M.F. of the Clark.
This Clark is then connected in turn in opposition with the other cells of which the
E.M.F. is required, and the difference between the electromotive forces of the two
determined in terms of the fall of potential along the Leclanché circuit.
