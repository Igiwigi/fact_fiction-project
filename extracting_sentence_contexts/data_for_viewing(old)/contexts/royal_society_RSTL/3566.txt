rous causes of disturbance to which observations of s0 much delicacy were liable,
such as changes of temperature or want of perfect uniformity in the dimensions or
texture of the beams, the results, as shown by the column of differences, exhibit
more regularity than could have been expected ; and they point out the position of
the neutral axis, as the centre of the beam, in a manner 80 decided, as to remove all
further doubt upon this subject, not only in the smaller strains, but in the larger ones
also; which, in the case of the second heam, were carried to about three-fourths of
the breaking weight.

It will be observed also that the extensions and compressions increase in an
arithmetical ratio from the centre to the extreme upper and lower sides of the beam.

These experiments having established the fact that the neutral axis is in the centre
of a rectangular beam, and that its position is not sensiþly altered by variations in
the amount of strain applied, it becomes evident that if there were no other elements
of strength than the resistances to direct extension and compression, the well-known

should give the breaking weight when #'is equal to the smaller of these two resist-
ances, which in cast iron is the tensile resistance. But the weight 80 calculated is
less than half the actual strength of the beam.
In considering this question, I was forcibly struck by the circumstance, that, in
applying the law of * ut tensio sic vis” to contiguous fibres, under different degrees of
tension and compression, the effect of lateral adhesion is omitted, and each fibre is
