6. Conditional regularity

Strong solutions have many good properties in addition to their uniqueness. For example, if a
solution is strong on [0, T], i.e. once we know that the enstrophy is finite for all t € [0, T], then the
solution is actually smooth for all t € (0,T], so for all 0 <t < T the equations are satisfied in the
classical sense (see Theorem 10.6 in [4], Ch. 7 of [5], or Section 6 in [3]). In fact, in the periodic
case, such a solution is even analytic, see [25].

This motivates the search for other ‘conditional’ regularity results: given a weak solution u
starting from smooth initial data, what additional properties will ensure that it is in fact a smooth
solution? The statement that a strong solution is smooth can be interpreted in this light, where the
‘additional property’ of the weak solution is that its enstrophy is bounded. Here, we give another
simple example of a conditional regularity result: we show that the assumption that

T
| \|u(s)|I2, ds < oo, where |l11(£)lloo = sup |u(2x, f)I, (6.1)
0 xe

is sufficient to ensure that u is a strong solution on [0,T], and hence smooth (and unique). Note
that (6.1) certainly holds if for some K > 0, ||u(£)llo <K for all t €[0,T], ie. if the velocity is
bounded on [0, T].
