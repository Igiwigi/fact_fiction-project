It now grows quickly and from below,
fig. 8, Plate 30, its crescentic slit-like external opening can be seen. With further
growth this slit gradually extends round the anus until the horns of the crescent meet
dorsally and the intestine becomes surrounded by the ingrown tissues. This ingrowth
is, in fact, the trunk rudiment, and it is already divided into several segments long before
the intestine is enclosed within it. From the anterior border of the crescentic slit to the
posterior border of the mouth an area of thickened hyposphere tissue can be seen, and
in this a little later a second invagination takes place to form the buccal organ. This
can be seen in lateral view in fig. 7, Plate 29, of a larva twenty-one days old.
