The Angel Fish from Georgia.—In the lenses of this fish the two structures are
very distinct, and also the teeth of the fibres.

6. Mullet from Georgia.—I am in some doubt respecting the existence of the dou-
ble structure in the lens of this fish. The observation which I made many years ago
is thus recorded : © A sort of diffused polarity round two poles, as if there were two
septa on each side, like those of the hare, or on one, like that of the turtle.” As a dif-
fused polarity was the only fact actually observed, I find that I have placed the mul-
let in the list of fishes without septa.

7, 8. Red and Grey Gurnard.—In the lenses of both these fishes there were two
short septa on one side and none on the other. In examining the lens of a very large turtle, in which the eyeball was 1-4 of an
inch in diameter, and that of the lens 0:25 of an inch, I found to my great surprise
that there were three septa in front, as in quadrupeds, and four septa, or rather siz,
as in the seal.
