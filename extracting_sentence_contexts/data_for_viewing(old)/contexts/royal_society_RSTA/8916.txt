124 DR. L. N. G. FILON AND MR. H. T. JESSOP ON THE STRESS-OPTICAL

On unloading there is at first an immediate recovery, but this is only partial. A very
definite residual retardation is observed, which gradually disappears completely, if
enough time is allowed, at any rate for the range of loading employed which was well
inside the yield point.

(3) This optical creep is comparatively large and may easily amount to 10 per cent.
of the initial value in a few minutes. This percentage, however, diminishes as the load
is decreased. These facts have an important bearing on stress determinations from
observations of artificial double refractions in celluloid.

(4) The stretch of the celluloid follows laws closely similar to those of the optical
retardation, the initial stretch being also approximately proportional to the applied load.

(5) The retardation r and stretch ยง are connected in each case by a linear relation

r = aT-+ 8,

T being the applied load in each case.
The constants a, 6 are found to vary within fairly narrow limits for any given specimen
at a given time. During recovery after unloading,
