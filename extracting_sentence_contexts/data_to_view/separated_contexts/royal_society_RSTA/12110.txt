The Fizeau experiment has
verified the one. I propose to attempt the other. To this end I am passing a beam
of light, split into two equal halves, very near a rapidly rotating disk (in fact between

mechanical motion and the other half travels against it. The two half beams, after
several journeys round and round, are united, with interference effects, and the
observation consists in watching the system of bands for any shift caused by the
motion. For description of this experiment see {ยง 33-47 below.
