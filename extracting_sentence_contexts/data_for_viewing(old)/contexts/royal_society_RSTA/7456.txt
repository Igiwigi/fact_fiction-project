The velocity of the sheet can be calculated from the movement of the holes, in the
250s interval. The sheet velocity calculated thus is 1030 cm/s. Similarly, the velocity
of the contraction due to surface tension can be calculated from the enlargement of the
holes. This is 337 cm/s. It can also be observed in this photograph that the leading edge
of the sheet moves a shorter distance. It has, in fact, only the resultant velocity of the
forward velocity minus the contraction velocity, namely, 693 cm/s. It is also seen that
once the particles have left the sheet and are no longer influenced by the contraction
velocity, they have a greater forward velocity, namely, 915 cm/s.

Approximate calculations show that the break-up of the threads in our photographs
conforms to Rayleighâ€™s theory of the stability of liquid columns. The theory says that a
free column of liquid is unstable if its length is greater than its circumference. For a non-
viscous liquid the wave-length of that disturbance which will grow most rapidly in
amplitude is 4-5 times the diameter. The results of some of our calculations are given in
table 7 and show a fair agreement between the theoretical values and those calculated from
figures 284 and c (position 3, 4, 5) and others.
