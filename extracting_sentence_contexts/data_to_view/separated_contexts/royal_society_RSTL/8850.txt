In our calculations also we have taken 2, the specific
heat of the non-gaseous portion of the charge, at its mean value. It should, however,
be taken at a higher value, since the specific heat must increase rapidly with the
temperature ; and this difference no doubt more than compensates for the 1oss of heat to
which we have referred as not being taken into account. Our hypothesis as to a portion of the charge remaining unconsumed until the pro-
jectile approaches the muzzle, is confirmed by the well-known fact that in short guns, or
