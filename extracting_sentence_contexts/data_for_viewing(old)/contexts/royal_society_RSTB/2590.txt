opaque, is not always so. It varies very considerably even in perfectly fresh skeletons.
The “ points ” in a transverse section of Galaxea, for example, appear at one place
homogeneous, and yellowish or dingy-brown in colour, in another place the “ point”
seems a fairly large, circular area filled with granular, powdery material, and then it
is usually dark. 3

Regarding the “line,” it may be said that very often the mere fissure between the
two halves of a septum, which forms readily in all sections, often gives the appearance
”; but such a fissure usually ends irregularly in smailer cracks, or
bends suddenly out of the median plane across one of the halves. It is, therefore, easy
to distinguish it from a “ dark line,” which breaks up into a series of ‘‘ dark points.”
Several authors have observed that the “ dark line ” in certain genera is so constituted,
but it was long looked upon as a fairly accepted fact that the median “dark line” in
other genera, e.g., Huphyllia, Flabellum, was a really continuous line representing a
special median lamina, Huinpz (Introd., p. 99), in examining Septastrea, a genus
structurally resembling Flabellwm, found, instead of a distinct lamina in the median

of a median “line

plane of the septum, a separable fenestrated tissue on the inner or median surfaces of
both halves of the septum.

Those are the already observed facts on which the theory rests of a ‘ primary
septum ” composed of “ primary spines.” No one has sought to explain the origin of
the said “spines,” or how it came about that they are so remarkably varied in size,
