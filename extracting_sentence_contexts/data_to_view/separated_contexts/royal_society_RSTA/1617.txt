The same argument applies for the fixed points in W3,9. a

Remark 2.10. We observe that in terms of number of fixed points, theorem 2.9 gives exactly :
the same information as the Poincaré-Birkhoff fixed-point theorem. On the other hand, our result [=
allows to localize the fixed points (which are in the first and in the third quadrant) and, moreover, 3
we do not require conditions of area-preserving type so that theorem 2.9 can be applied to planar :
systems which are not necessarily Hamiltonian. areal

A result which is dual to theorem 2.9 can be obtained by assuming (TCO-) instead of (TC0*). : 3
We stress the fact that theorem 2.9, even if, apparently does not improve the Poincaré—Birkhoff 3
theorem, with respect to the number of fixed points, nevertheless, it contains some crucial : Ss
information about the dynamics of the map F. This is explained in the following result. [3

Corollary 2.11. Let YW: Ag > (Ap) C Ay be a continuous map which can be represented as in (2.6)
