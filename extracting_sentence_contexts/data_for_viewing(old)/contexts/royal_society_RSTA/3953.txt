2. Methods

(a) Coupling lattice Boltzmann and molecular dynamics

According to our computational scheme, macromolecules and the aqueous solvent are described
differently. We employ particles to represent proteins and advance them in time via the molecular
dynamics method, fluid populations are used to represent the aqueous solvent and advance
them in time according to the lattice Boltzmann method. The resulting lattice Boltzmann
molecular dynamics (LBMD) methodology handles the interactions between solute and solvent
particles through a lumped representation of the local collisions, and consequently hydrodynamic
interactions are naturally included in the simulation. Given the fact that we represent the
solvent molecules at the probabilistic level, the dual simulation technique can host not only
hydrodynamics, but also a wide range of physical elements, including thermodynamic forces,
electrokinetics, pH-dependent forces and so on, being a flexible platform for multiphysics. At the
same time, the LBMD is intrinsically multiscale, because the resolution of both components, the
fluid and the molecular system can be chosen to cover a wide spectrum of conditions.

In the LBMD scheme, we take into account the presence of water via a minimalistic, yet explicit,
representation of the solvent, with a computational cost that, at fixed concentration, is roughly
proportional to the number of proteins in solution. While the explicit treatment of the solvent
appears to burden the overall technique when compared with the Brownian dynamics simulation
approach, the main advantage of LBMD is that the solvent locally responds to the motion of the
embedded proteins without the need for specifying the system Greenâ€™s function to account for
