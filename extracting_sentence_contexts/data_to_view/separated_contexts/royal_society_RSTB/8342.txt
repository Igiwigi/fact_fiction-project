We start our survey with a simple, well-defined cannot be specified by a regular expression (see the text-
computational system, termed a finite-state machine, books listed earlier for mathematical proofs). We
which is equivalent to another simple construct conclude from this fact that there are patterns that we
called a ‘regular expression’. Search functions, such can conceive of, and that we could easily (if laboriously)
as the dir command in DOS, or the /s function in recognize ourselves, but that cannot be captured by a
UNIX, provide everyday examples. Such functions regular expression.
