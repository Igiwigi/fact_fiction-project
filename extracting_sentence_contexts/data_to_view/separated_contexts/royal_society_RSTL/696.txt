On the discovery of fulminating mercury by Mr. HowarD,
he endeavoured to communicate fulminating properties to
compounds of platinum, by means of alcohol, but his trials
were unsuccessful. I have to a certain extent succeeded in
this way, and my attempts have led- to the observation of
some new facts. I have also obtained a new compound of
platinum, analogous in its properties and composition to aurum
Fulminans, and which, in consequence, I shall venture to
designate by the term fulminating platinum. I have, indeed,
already noticed a peculiar compound of platinum under this
name,* but the term should be restricted to the new com-
pound, on account of its superior fulminating properties.
