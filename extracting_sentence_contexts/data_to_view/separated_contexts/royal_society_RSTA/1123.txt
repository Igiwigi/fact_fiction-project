Among the 29 studies reviewed, soil, sea salt, secondary
sulphate, motor vehicle emissions, coal burning, wood smoke, biomass combustion, Cu smelter
emissions, residual oil combustion and incinerator emissions were found to be associated with
health outcomes. Another noteworthy quote on the subject from Krall and colleagues states
‘Associations with a given PM25 chemical component should be considered as potentially
indicative of associations with another component or set of components with similar sources’
[31]. It is in fact a belief of various commentators in the field that the literature suggests that
various complex mixtures may be involved, and that the capability of PM to induce disease may
be the result of multiple components acting through different physiological mechanisms [32,33]. Efforts continue to tease out which components and sources of PM are most harmful since to
identify regulation targets can better protect human health. Epidemiological studies of sources
are, however, challenging since source-specific exposures (e.g.
