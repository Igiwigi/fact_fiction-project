parameter, and it was again observed that the fraction is much higher at lower convergence
ratios.

While these works have focused on indirect drive, direct-drive experiments have also observed
behaviour that is more 1D-like at low CR. Direct-drive experiments on OMEGA looking at
shots with adiabats greater than 3.5 observed that the hotspot pressure and compressed areal
density (the focus of the study) measured experimentally showed much closer agreement with
1D simulations for convergence ratios below 17 [39]. This level of agreement was quite high;
the hotspot pressure averaged over the measured neutron rate was found to be about 90%
of that produced by the 1D simulations. A rapid decrease in agreement was observed above
CR = 17, which agrees with the previously discussed findings presented by Zylstra et al. As well
as using direct rather than indirect drive, the work at OMEGA also used conventional DT ice
layers rather than wetted foams. The fact that a similar trend was observed in the OMEGA work
suggests therefore that the observations made by Olson ef al. and Zylstra et al. are applicable
more broadly than to just indirectly driven wetted foam capsules, and also likely applies for
direct-drive ICF.

However, it is also clear from ยง2a that 1D performance and yield increase with increasing CR.
There is therefore a compromise to be made between improved idealized 1D performance, and
increased agreement between simulation and experiment. Based on the results in [5,6], this work
will use an upper limit of 16 for the convergence ratio (the first criterion which all simulations in
the simulation campaign are tested against). This sits firmly in the region where the agreement
is reasonably good, but enables a much greater level of 1D performance than would be possible
using the lowest CR values in this range.
