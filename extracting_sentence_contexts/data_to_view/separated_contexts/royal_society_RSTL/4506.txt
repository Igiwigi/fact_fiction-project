In the method here proposed, the magnet is under circum-
stances precisely similar to those which would exist when it is subsequently used in
observation ; it may therefore be considered less open to objection than the ordi-
nary method of deflection, by which the temperature coefficient is inferred from the
mutual action of two magnets and the earth on each other. Amongst other sources
of uncertainty in the latter method, may be mentioned the unexplained difference in
the result that has frequently been observed, according as the marked or unmarked
pole of the deflecting, has been turned towards the deflected magnet ; arising pro-
bably from the unequal, and possibly variable, distribution of magnetism throughout
the bar; which conditions, if they really exist, will have precisely the same effect on
the indications of the magnet when under trial, as they would have when it is in
actual use. By introducing the differences only of the scale-readings into the calculation,
large numerical quantities are avoided, as well as the necessity of adopting a zero
point, or scale-reading corresponding to no deflecting force.

* The fact of the decrease of magnetic intensity not being in the simple ratio of the increase of temperature,

but in some higher ratio, was it is believed first announced by Professor Carsm1E, Sec. R.S., in the Philoso-
phical Transactions, 1825, p. 63. Keppel Street, 1849, June 21.
