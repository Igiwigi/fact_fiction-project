An attempt may be made (as in ‘ Proceedings,’

‘8 p. 454) to account for the uniformity of the atomic charges thus gained or lost, from
the point of view of the establishment of a path of disruptive discharge from one

8 atom to another. But it seems preferable to adopt a more fundamental view. The most remarkable fact about the distribution of matter throughout the universe

ie is that, though it is aggregated in sensible amounts only in excessively widely

6. separated spots, yet wherever it occurs, it is most probably always made up of the

= same limited number of elements. It would seem that we are almost driven to

6 explain this by supposing the atoms of all the chemical elements to be built up of

3 combinations of a single type of primordial atom, which itself may represent or be

3 evolved from some homogeneous structural property of the «ther.* It is, again,

2 difficult to imagine how the chemical elements should be invariably connected,

8g through all their combinations, with the same constant of gravitation, unless they

have somehow a common underlying origin, and are not merely independent self-

_ Ssubsisting systems. We may assume that it is these ultimate atoms, or let us say

~ monads, that form the simple singular points in the zther ; and the chemical atoms
_ will be points of higher singularity formed by combinations of them.
