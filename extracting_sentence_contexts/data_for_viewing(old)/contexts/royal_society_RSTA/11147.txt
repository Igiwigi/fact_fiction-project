produced by the same expansions when the air is exposed to weak ultra-violet light,
are thus essentially different phenomena from the apparently similar condensation
produced in air ionised by Réntgen rays.

We might perhaps most naturally conclude that we are in these cases not
concerned with ions at all. There is, however, the difficulty of the unlikelihood of
two entirely different classes of nuclei being so exactly identical in the degree of
supersaturation necessary to cause water to condense on them. ‘The apparent
existence of a second coincidence (an increase of the number of drops when %./v,
exceeds 1°31) is still harder to explain on this view.

It is possible that condensation in these cases really does take place on ions
carrying the same charge as those produced by Réntgen rays. ‘There are, in fact,
several ways in which we may account for the fact that an electric field does not
remove them, :

We might suppose that the nuclei differ from those produced by Réntgen rays
merely in being so much larger, that their velocity in a given field is diminished
enormously, the charge in each nucleus remaining the same. It is difficult, however,
to believe that the efficiency of the nucleus in helping condensation would remain
