vesicle is neither food-yelk nor formative yelk, but differs in structure and reactio
from both in a very marked manner, although it contains probably a little albumen 4*,
It may be called primitive yelk. That water and other fluids cause no visible vacuola-
tion in its substance may possibly be due to the fact, that if it were delicate it might be
obscured by the changes which are produced at the same time in the cells of the ovisac,
and which at times are very confusiug.

The primitive yelk is very firm, and often escapes on cutting up a fragment of an
ovary in 1 per cent. solution of chloride of 8odium, or in a s0lution of glycerine 2 per.
cent., as a solid-looking, somewhat angular body, with its contained germinal vesicle
(Plate XV. tig. 15). In water also it is 8olid, though much paler, when escaped, than in
the other media. Although it is not like the perfect formative yelk in structure or pro-
perties, it may possibly be continued in a modified form, and exist in some proportion
in the ripe oyum, as its reactions are rather negative than positive, and it might there-
fore easily escape detection.
