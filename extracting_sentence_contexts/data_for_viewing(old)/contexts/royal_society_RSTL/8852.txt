degrees, and therefore more stringent, than those found before; but they appear to
carry the 8ubject to its limit.

If the surfaces touch also at the point P,, we may in like manner use as the formulze
for elimination the following, viz.

The results obtained by these two methods cannot of course be independent. In
fact the equivalence of the two forms may be readily shown as follows. The first result
is a rational function, homogeneous in the two quantities 1"-'0, 01 . 1-22, 8ay

(ER0T 01 = RE R=0s
and in like manner the second may be represented by the equation

On multiplying the first by (2"0)">?, and the second by (1"-'0)"=?, we obtain the two
expressions
