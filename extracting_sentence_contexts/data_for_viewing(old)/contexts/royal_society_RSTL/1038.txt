If the force of fired gunpowder is 50 very.great, how does it
happen that fire-arms and artillery of all kinds, which certainly
are not calculated to withstand $80 enormous a force, are not ;

in my experiments, and which was more than ten times stronger
in proportion to the size of its bore than ever a piece of ordnance

gunpowder is less rapid than it has hitherto been supposed to
be, and the objection in question falls to the ground.

Mr. Rozxs's theory supposes that all the powder of which
