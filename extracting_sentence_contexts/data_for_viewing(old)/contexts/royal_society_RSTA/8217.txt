mately (A’ -+- B’) (ey, + ex,)/2 grammes of vapour into the H,SO, in vessel 5.

Thus vessel 4 loses more vapour than vessel 2.

Now lower the temperature to Ty; a volume of air, say, A” c.c. leaves vessel 2 to
enter vessel 1, and carries with it*

A” (7, + e7,)/2 grammes of vapour,
and at the same time vessel 4 loses
(A” + BY”) (e2, + e2,)/2 grammes of vapour.

Again vessel 4 loses more vapour than 2, and it is readily seen that both losses are due to
the fact that more air passes over the last vessel than over the first; so that if we had
had vessel 4 charged with EtOH instead of water, the alcohol would have lost relatively
more than the water ; on the other hand, had vessel 2 contained the alcohol, the water
in 4 would then have lost relatively more than the alcohol.

The discrepancies between the ratio of vapour densities when derived with water
leading and with EtOH leading are thus qualitatively explained.

Turning now to correction 6 (a). If we apply the preceding discussion to the losses
in two water vessels, which are joined together without any intervening H,SO,, it is
manifest that the second vessel will lose more than the first. If the dimensions of the
two vessels are the same and if the rate of change of temperatures is slow and its range
sufficiently restricted, the first vessel will on balance suffer no loss. This result is due
