The absence of a negative term in the observed D doublets of Mg suggests, as an
alternative view, that the associated F series may be derived from the first line
actually observed, namely 42798. In tliat case LorEensrr’s formula would give for
the limit of the F series: 84,893°0—35,728'7 = 49,164°3, and the Hicks formula
85,479°8—35,728°7 = 49,751°1. These figures at once suggest the limit 49,778 of the “4481” series; and the
available data for the Wide doublets are, in fact, consistent with the assumption that
the agreement is exact. It would seem then that the “4481” series may be a
Fundamental series deriving its limits from the first positive line of the D series of
Wide doublets. In that case the D line \ 2798 would be expected to have a
satellite with the same separation as the lines of the “4481” series, namely,
dn = 0°99.
