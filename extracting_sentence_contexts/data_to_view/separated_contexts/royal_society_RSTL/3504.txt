Being
much annoyed with this, I adopted for camera pictures a process which proved both
convenient and effectual, and which applies equally well to both descriptions of

* 1st, or mordant wash, saturated s0lution of acetate of lead.

2nd, weak solution of common alt, containing y{; of salt.
3rd, nitrate of silyer, S. G. = 1:20, which however is best applied in two consecutive washes each of
8. 6. 1:10.
+ Some camera pictures which I carried with me to Paris, and which were prepared on the 28th of April,

were found on arrival much discoloured ; and others prepared at the same time, were turned brown on my re-
turn from France about a month afterwards, (Neither had been fixed.)

paper. It consists in simply delaying the last or efficient wash of nitrate of silyer,
on which the sensitive quality depends, till the moment of using it, and in fact using
the paper actually wet with the nitrate, and applied with its sensitive face against a
glass plate whose hinder surface is in the focus of the camera. This affords other
collateral advantages: 1st, that all crumpling or undulation of the paper is avoided ;
2nd, that, being rendered in some degree transparent, the light is enabled to act deeper
within its substance. If lead be nsed as the mordant basis of the paper, it is manifest
that it can snstain no injury whateyer by keeping or exposure, there being no ingre-
dient on which the light can act, present, until the moment it is used*.
