When the discharges are beyond 15 km. there is very little difference between the
mean initial rates of recovery after positive and after negative field-changes, the
recovery after the negative changes being slightly more rapid. The interpretation of
these figures is complicated by the fact that both positive and negative field-changes
presumably include both flashes to earth and also discharges in the cloud. It would be
expected, in view of the earlier discussion, that the recovery rate after a discharge to
earth would be slower than after a flash in the cloud when the regeneration of the field
is proportional to the speed of the primary process of separation of charges. When we
turn to the figures for slightly nearer discharges, at distances between 10 and 15 km.,
there is little change in the recovery rates. It is interesting to note, however, that there
is a small decrease in the mean initial rate of recovery after negative field-changes.
This is just what would be anticipated, since the proportion of negative field-changes
which are due to discharges to earth is considerably higher between 10 and 15 km.
than beyond 15 km., since the reversal distance for a cloud discharge of type 1 is not
infrequently between 10 and 15 km. Recoveries of type B occur in both ranges of
distances after field-changes of either sign; they are relatively more frequent, however,
