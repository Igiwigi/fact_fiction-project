Moreover, property (iii) is also
approached by our model because 6 > 0 can be fixed to an arbitrarily small value (however it
is not possible to make exactly 5 = 0). An expository interpretation of our result may be that making the Signorini contact condition
in displacement ‘dynamic a bit’ (recall that boundary conditions having quantities with time
derivative are called dynamic) leads to some stabilization effect to the system. We expect that


this fact has some connection with Baumgarte-like stabilization techniques known in numerical
simulations of non-smooth mechanics (see [17]), which is to be investigated in the future. The
present result will also be of basic interest when we make an attempt to more involved crack
problems, e.g. propagation and singular behaviour of crack tips. This paper is organized as follows.
