This mental two-step process is indistinguishable from the
actual one’ [12]. Measuring A of an ensemble for the system created in state a’ is then naturally
symbolized by Ala’) = |a’)a’ and |a')A =a’ |a’). One then finds that these symbols behave as a set of vectors dual to each other and to the
measurement symbols, because it is natural to their interpretation that both

(a |a") =8(a',0") (3.7)

and

Yia’ya'=1, (3.8)

the first by virtue of the fact that a’ and a” are different and the latter because all possible
measurements are considered. Thus, one has for them both orthonormality and completeness,
providing the basis for a geometry of states. One finds an explicit expression for the property A in
terms of states by multiplying by the corresponding destruction symbols (a’| and summing over
all values of a’:

A=>o laa. (3.9)

Schwinger points out that the physical property A is characterized by the possible results of its
measurement (the numbers a’) and by the symbols of creation and annihilation of a system in the
states labelled by those results, a’, so that one also has for any function f(A) of A,

FA)= SO la yfaya’. (3.10)


Returning to the consideration of successive measurements, first the creation of a state b’ and
then its being measured for A in some way (symbolized by M(A)), will yield that M(A) |b’) has
the effect of the destruction of the b’ state:

(b'|M(A)|b’). (3.11)

By starting with a measurement that accepts no systems, then one state, two states and so on
through increasingly less selective measurements—tecalling that this involves summing over
selective measurement symbols—one sees that the resulting quantities, which can be written in
the form p(a’, b’), are candidates for probabilities.
