of weight. In till water the bending-strain (in proportion to the products of the dis-
placements and the lengths) is about one half as seyere in the © Bellerophon' as it is in
the © Minotaur,” on a wave-crest it is less than #w0-thirds as severe, and in a wave-hollow
it is proportionately about one and one-fourth as great in the * Bellerophon* type as it
is in the © Minotaur.” Another point of contrast is found in the fact that the maximum
hogging- and sagging-strains are practically about equal in the * Bellerophon' type,
whereas in the © Minotaur' the hogging-strain is very nearly double the sagging-strain. The longer ship must have, therefore, a very great reserye of strength against sagging if
8he is strong enough to resist hogging; and this fact prevents the material from being
80 well disposed as it might be if there were not s0 great a difference between the two
8 extremes of strain. This follows from the consideration that an iron-built ship, such as
= the © Minotaur,” is comparatively strong against sagging, because (if the longitudinal
