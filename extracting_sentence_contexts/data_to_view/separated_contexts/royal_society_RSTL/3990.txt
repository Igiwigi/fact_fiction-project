Moreover, it will be observed that they are essentially similar to the
nucleated blood-cells in the uncoloured stage of the blood of the mammiferous embryo
and of the oviparous vertebrate animals. In their mode of development from granule-
cells, as indicated by the occurrence of cells in transition stages (fig. 10.) as well as in
their structure, they are in fact clearly identical. I recognise them therefore as the
corpuscles in human blood in the phase of nucleated cell, uncoloured stage. 66.
