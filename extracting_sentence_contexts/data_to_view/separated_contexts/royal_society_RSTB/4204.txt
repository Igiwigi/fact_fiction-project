The palatal processes of the premaxille (fig. 2, proc.p.p.ma.) lie immediately under
the paraseptal cartilages which they partly hide in the ventral view. The processes
are short, not extending further than about one-third the length of the paraseptals. Tn fact, the premaxille are mere flat plates of bone developed below the floor of the
olfactory capsules ; but further back they become triangular in section, and rise rapidly
on the plates of the capsules. The relative positions of the premaxillse and the
anterior nares are interesting, being intermediate between that observed by Broom
in Trichosurus and Dasyurus. The premaxilla in Dasyurus is entirely posterior to
the anterior nares; in 7â€™richoswrus it occupies a more anterior position, overlapping
the ventral floor of the anterior nares.
