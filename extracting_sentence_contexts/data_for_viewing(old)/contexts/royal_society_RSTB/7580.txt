Few young are believed to have been weaned until June (see below) ; but by the fourth
week weight distributions were clearly bimodal. Most animals over 22-2 g had been
marked, and it is likely that unmarked ones over this weight were also adults. One
unmarked male weighed only 23 g and may have been young; but since it died in the trap
it is more likely to have been an old one that had lost weight. (One male weighing
19-5 g was 6 g less than in May.) It is possible that a few early young had already become
pregnant; but it is more likely that the few unmarked females over 22:2 g were born in
1936. The lightest marked female weighed 23 g; those below this weight were probably
all young.

In August the majority of both sexes over 22:2 g had either been marked in May or
June, and only one of them was that seasonâ€™s young. The June-marked young, in fact,
had almost all disappeared, as shown by the comparative number of recaptures in table 12.
Thus out of forty-eight adults released in June twenty-five were retaken in August and
fourteen in September; out of twenty-three young released in June only two were retaken
in August; none in September. The two young recaptured in August weighed 24-5 g (2)
and 17-5 g ($); another female, first recaptured in February, weighed 17 g. Since there
is no reason to suppose that marking had affected their viability, the early young must have
suffered a heavy mortality between June and August 1937.

The lowest weight of a marked adult male in August was 26 g, and unmarked males
over 26 g are likely to have been adults too. It is equally likely that those below 22-3 g
were young of the year since none carried rings from May or June. The grouping of the
females is less distinct, and animals below 22-3 g form only 44% of the catch compared
