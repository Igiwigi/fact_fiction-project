mock theta functions. In particular, in §3(d), we discuss applications to topology, and state and
prove a new interpretation of the right-hand sides of the radial limits in theorems 2.3 and 2.4.

(a) Radial limits of universal mock theta functions

As a companion to a function studied by Hickerson (sometimes denoted by g3(w; q)), Gordon and
McIntosh defined the universal mock theta function [25]

oo _ ae n(n+1)/2
g0(w;q) = > 2
mp Ui Dn OW" Dnt

This function is so named due to the fact that all of Ramanujan’s mock theta functions can be
expressed in terms of linear combinations of specializations of gz and ordinary modular forms.
Extending results from [21], some of which are discussed above, Rhoades [26] asked if one could
similarly explicitly determine modular forms f,p,4,p,n,k in a uniform way such that go(cfq4 ; q® )-
fa,b,A,B,h,k(9) is bounded as q > gf radially from within the unit disc, and subsequently find finite


formulae for these radial limits. These questions were answered by Bringmann & Rolen [27] in
2015, who determined modular forms f,,p,4,8,1,k Such that

Qa,b,A,B hk = Him (ga(6p q):9°) — fa ABhk(Q))
qk
