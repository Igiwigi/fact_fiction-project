For instance, the distribution of answers to a question
depends on a question asked and answered before it. One could call this contextuality, and many
do. This is, however, a trivial sense of contextuality, on a par with the fact that the distribution
of answers to a question depends on what this question is. One should not be surprised that
other factors (such as temperature in the laboratory or questions asked and answered previously)
can influence this distribution too. We call this inconsistent connectedness, and we offer a theory
that distinguishes this ubiquitous feature from contextuality in a different, one could argue more
interesting meaning.
