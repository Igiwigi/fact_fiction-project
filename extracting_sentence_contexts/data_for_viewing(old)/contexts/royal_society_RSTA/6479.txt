Menergy for society ™ energy used to procure energy

Figure 2. The ‘net energy cliff’. As ERO! declines from high values to lower values, it makes little difference to society, as the
net energy delivered does not change much. But below an EROI of 10 : 1 any declines make a large difference on the amount
delivered (darker colour) (Courtesy of Euan Mearns).

First, BioPhysical economics considers the implications of the fact that there is a limited supply
of fossil fuels on the planet and we are quickly reaching the peak of their availability ([46]; see
also www.bpeinstitute.org); there is also a limited supply of raw materials. It acknowledges that
the process of converting economies to renewable forms of energy is a long one, fraught with
all kinds of challenges and limitations. Consequently, it questions the fundamental assumption
in neoclassical economics that continual economic growth is possible and should be the goal
of all economic activity. Hall writes, ‘BioPhysical economics considers and encourages the
possibility that humans are capable of achieving happiness by means other than the acquisition
of ever-increasing quantities of material goods—goods that cannot be produced with declining
resources’ [6]. It maintains that the focus in economics should be on living well within the
limits of nature. As mentioned (on p. 9), Odum agreed with this view later in his life [16].
Hall writes that he could see that we were nearing the peak of the availability of fossil
fuels and ‘that we should redirect our efforts away from luxury consumption and blind
