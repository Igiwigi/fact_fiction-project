should have been set aside for tail production, or the failure of those cells, in spite of
their normal composition to cohere together to form a co-ordinate structure.

The only account of the early cleavage of the egg of an ascidian with anural develop-
ment is that given by Lacaze-Duruters in 1874. Admittedly he made his observations
on the development of the small egg of Molgula occulta (his Anurella roscovita) at a
time when ascidians were yet thought to be most closely related to the Mollusca and
when the characteristic cleavage forms were unknown, but the fact that he stated
that the first division was invariably unequal, and that cleavage resulted in the formation
of translucent micromeres and yolky macromeres made it possible that he was correct
and that in this peculiarity lay the explanation of the abbreviated or anural develop-
ment. The observations of Damas on the development of Molgula bleizi commenced
at too late a stage to be of any value in this respect. Therefore, the cleavage of the
eggs of Molgula occulta was examined with very great care when this species was
cultured at Roscoft during the summer of 1926. The specimens were obtained
through following the directions as to locality given by Lacaze-Duruters, and the
cleavage of eggs was examined in cultures made on about six different occasions,
and from living material. Molgula oculata was cultured at the same time to act as a
control.
