times q/?. Let dgn be the relative dimension of Mgn over Spec(Z), which is 3g — 3 +n for g>1. : =
Let by be the number of ‘random’ eigenvalues of weight 2d, — k (i.e. of coweight k). We have by =0 : yy
for k < (2g — 2)/3; see theorem 3.3. For k > (2¢ — 2)/3, if there are few eigenvalues of coweight k, : 2
eg. be = o(q'/ 2), then the weight k eigenvalues contribute nothing to the Grothendieck—Lefschetz : S
sum in the limit as g —> oo. On the other hand, if there are many eigenvalues of coweight k, and we : a
model them with eigenvalues of a large random unitary matrix, we know from a result of [23] that : Ss
this matrix has bounded trace with high probability. It is thus a sensible heuristic to neglect the : &
contribution of all but the causal eigenvalues. Our neglect of the random Frobenius eigenvalues [8s
is also consistent with a commonly held philosophy in the study of moduli spaces, that no natural :3

geometric questions depend on the non-tautological classes (e.g. Vakil [24]).

That this heuristic is sensible relies crucially on the fact that there are no random eigenvalues
of large weight, which is a deep fact about the cohomology of moduli spaces of curves conjectured
by Mumford and later proved using topological techniques (see §2 for references). The compactly
supported étale cohomology in high degrees (or equivalently by Poincaré duality and a Betti-
étale comparison isomorphism, the Betti cohomology in low degrees; see theorem 3.3) is spanned
by tautological classes, i.e. classes which arise from algebraic cycles produced by canonical
morphisms between moduli spaces. The prototypical example of such a class is the first Chern
class of the relative dualizing sheaf of the morphism Mg, > Mg,-1 obtained by forgetting one
marked point.

We may formalize our heuristic as follows. Write Rio (Mg ni, Qe) for the subspace of
