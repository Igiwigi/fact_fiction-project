Before describing bhese sections, I may remark that the nasal passage carries the
upper lip far in front of the lower ; but the lower lip, even in the Ammocate, is far
back ; whereas, in the adult Lamprey, the lower lip, when the sucking disc ts in action,
projects beyond the © anterior dorsal cartilage,” and its enclosing skin, the upper lip. The end of the external nasal passage is protected by nasal barbels, and the mouth
opens further back ; there are two pairs of oral barbels, the outer unciform and
the inner mammillate. There are three nasal barbels on one side and four on the
other ; 8iaz thin sections of this part, one of which was drawn, show this ; and,
corroborative of this fact, Dr. GUNTHER, in his © Study of Fishes ” (p. 695, fig. 320, A)
gives, in a woodeut, the same number in Myaine Australts. Section 1 (Plate 11, fig. 1).—Here the interior valvular opening of the external
nasal duct (e.n.) shows four points of cartilage (n.bb.) cut through on one side,
and three on the other ; the lesser barbels are close to the passage, and the larger
further out ; the fore end of the prepalatine reaches to this point,*

Section 2 (fig. 2). —The nasal canal or passage (n.p.) is now complete, and the first
ring is cut through in three places, above, and on each side (se also Plate 10, fig. 1);
for this imperfect, annulus has a rostrum.
