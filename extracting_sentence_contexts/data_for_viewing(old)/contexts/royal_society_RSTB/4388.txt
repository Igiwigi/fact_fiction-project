later than any other portion of the ducts, at the expense probably of a tubular
network. If this be so, that part of the “pancreatic duct” distal to the place of
anastomosis of the “accessory duct” with the “ pancreatic duct” in Man should be
termed the “secondary dorsal pancreatic duct.” It differs, however, in its relations
as compared with the Pig and Trichosurus. In the former, the secondary duct is
continuous with the dorsal pancreatic duct only, there being no ventral pancreatic
duct in the adult. In the latter, it connects up with the ventral pancreatic duct,
the presence of the dorsal duct in the adult being as yet undetermined. In Man, the
secondary duct connects up with both the dorsal and the ventral duct. The “acces-
sory duct” in Man is, of course, the persistent proximal part of the original dorsal
pancreatic duct.

In connection with the interesting fact that in 7ichosurus the dorsal pancreatic
duct may or may not persist in the late foetus, it is of importance to note the
developmental and adult conditions in other Amniotes.

In the Reptilia, only one duct persists in the adult; investigators differ, however,
concerning its origin. V6LKER (40), in Lacerta agilis, finds the dorsal duct bound up
with the ductus choledochus ; Hammar (14), also in the Lizard, finds a duct formed
by the fusion of the dorsal with the ventral duct ; CHoronsurrzky (3), in Anguis,
derives it from the two ventral ducts and the dorsal duct.

In Birds, Cooronsuitzky (3) finds all three ducts opening separately in the adult.

In the Monotremata, Kerpet (24) in Echidna finds two ducts, the ventral opening
