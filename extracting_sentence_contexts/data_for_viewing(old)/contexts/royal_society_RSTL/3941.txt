whence we have, as the law of derivation,
p a?
Pu(t)=—Z+—/fOafeSHOU(F;+(A(0 40) L+f (0) Bart).

To this we may add a precisely similar solution in ascending powers of y, the two
together constituting the complete integral.

We cannot, from the above, deduce Evuuzr's solution, because that solution is
expressed in ascending powers of t, and not of x or y. If, however, for A(t), /4(t),
F,(t) we substitute EuLsr's forms of those functions, and make f=#, we shall obtain
the result in question.

The general solution (19.) has been given in order to illustrate the fact before
adverted to, that when T\ of (17.) is not simply a function of D, the derivation of the
coefficients of the final series may inyolye operations which it is difficult to perform.

We shall now show how, by a linear transformation, the difficulty may be evaded.

As8ume xz—y=s, z+y=t, then FECL IL=T+S,

d dds, ddt d + d
and a= dy ad a a
and transforming the original equation, we find
T_T (ALOE (AO+/OLL,Ou=0.
