That f is contained in the quotient field of R follows from the definition of ,,
aed because any element of R not in p is not in qG,; similarly 2 is contained in the quotient
fighd of S. (Actually, both f and & are fields.)
THEOREM 5. Given any prime ideal p of R, there exists a prime ideal q of S lying over p.
3This is one of a series of existence-theorems proved by Krull (1937). The theorems in
stion hold under conditions more general than those postulated throughout Part I of
(Bis paper—as a matter of fact, that is true of almost all the results of this section. The proof
o&Theorem 5 reduces essentially to the remarks that unity cannot be integrally dependent
of the prime ideal pR,; so Theorem 14 supplies a prime ideal of S, which contains pG,,
aad consequently lies over p®,. In the paper of Krull (1937), again, (4, 5)—(4.7) are deduced
idly from the form of Theorem 5 proved there—
(4.5) A prime G-ideal q is maximal if and only if p (= qa ®) is maximal.
~3(4.6) If q lies over p, qS, is a minimal prime over-ideal of pS,.
