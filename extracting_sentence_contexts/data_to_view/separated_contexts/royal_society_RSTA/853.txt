The big political blocs invest and so
on. Allow a little satisfaction here: Europe has done very well, at least so far, probably because
there was more tolerance for foundations 40 years ago. It is a fact that the questioning around quantum non-locality has been extremely fruitful. The
1991 Ekert protocol for quantum key distribution [2] is a heroic example of the breakthroughs
that succeeded one after the other in the 1990s, e.g. quantum teleportation in 1993 [3] and Shorâ€™s
celebrated algorithm in 1995 [4]. Could it be that the other problem, the quantum measurement

problem, will eventually also prove to be highly fruitful?
