S Note.—Professor VALENTIN, of Berne, in his recently published work (Versuch einer
Aysiologixchen Pathologie des Herzens, Leipzig, 1866) gives the results of observations
gpde on Marmots during their winter sleep as to the relation between the respiratory
19ov ements and the arterial pressure. In the Marmot, when in profound sleep, the con-
actions of the heart occur at long intervals, which, however, are much exceeded in

ration by those which separate the respirations. By connecting the carotid artery

ith the kymographion (which can be done without waking the animal), a tracing was
ſue from which it appeared that the mercurial column sank during the first third
& inspiration, rose during the second two thirds, continued to rise during the beginning
& expiration, and again fell during the remainder. Of these facts he gives the following
tQeoretical explanation :—* 'The negative inspiration-pressure not only sucks air into the
kings, but blood towards the heart. The greater impletion of the heart enables it to
Fopel more blood into the arteries, and increases its frequency, while its contraction as
E@mpared with its relaxation is prolonged. Expiration produces an opposite result ; for
# facilitates the emptying of the lungs of blood, and adds to the systemic pressure. But,
3Basmuch as the heart becomes less and less full during expiration, the increase of pressure
8 limited to the commencement of the expiratory act, a 8smaller quantity of blood being
Fjected into the arteries. At the same time the duration of the contraction diminishes,
Mhile that of relaxation increases” (p. 353). Here the author appears to attach much
more importance to the direct influence of expiration than the facts warrant.
