Hyper-reflex excitability precedes the development of extensor rigidity.

8. The extensor rigidity is often accompanied by head dyspnoea and spasmodic
diaphragmatic respiration, and then general paralysis and death quickly follow.

9. The anemic respiratory centre can be temporarily relieved by the head-down

posture,


EFFECTS WHICH FOLLOW LIGATION OF THE CEREBRAL ARTERIES. 101

In close connection with these experiments stand certain results obtained by Morr
and SHERRINGTON.* These authors determined that, after a unilateral section of all
the posterior roots of the brachial plexus has been made in the monkey, the limb is
paralysed in so far as no â€œ
Nevertheless the limb reacted to cortical excitation, and in fact the arm area was, if
anything, hyper-excitable. The limb is, we may suppose, paralysed because the
spatial sensations which come from the limb no longer stream into the association
field formed by the cortex cerebri. The animal forgets that it has the limb.
