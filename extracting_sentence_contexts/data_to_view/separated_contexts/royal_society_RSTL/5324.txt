Art. (2.) Hence it follows that the ratios P,: Q, : R_ may be ascertained by the direct
application of the method of indeterminate coefficients, for Q, will contain e4, and
P. will contain  disposable constants, making e+2/ disposable conttants" in all,
Again, Q.Q and PP will each rise to the degree n+e+2=1 in x; but their sum R,
is to be only of —: dimensions in x. Hence we have to make (i#e4Lt)L(nLy,
i.e. e+2—1 quantities (which are linear in respect to the given" coefficients in
P and Q, as well as in respect to the new! disposable constants in P, and Q,) all
vanish, that is to say, there will be e+2:;—1 linear homogeneous equations to be
satisfied by means of e+2: disposable quantities ; the ratios of these latter are, there-
fore, determinate, 80 that we may write

and when (P,), (Q,), (R,) are taken prime to one another, it is obvious that (R,) will
be in all of e+2: dimensions' in the given coefficients, 7. e. of « in respect 'of the
coefficients of P, and of e+: in respect of those' of Q : A, will correspond to' what I
have previously called the allotrious factor; being in fact foreign to the value of R,
as determined by means of the equation (4.), and arising only from the particalar
method employed to obtain it throngh the medium of the system (1.): it becomes a
matter of some interest and importance to determine the values of this allotrious
factor for different values of *.

Magazine (December, 1839) ; but by an easily explicable error of inadvertence, the quantities © Q,,” ** Q,,” &e.

'This error is corrected by my distinguished friend M. STurRM (LiouviLLE's Journal, tom. viii. 1842, | Sur. un
th6oreme d'Algdbre de M. SyLvesres), who appears, however, to have overlooked that I was obviously
well acquainted with the existence and nature of these factors, and their essential character, of being perfect
<quares in the case contemplated in his memoir and my own.
