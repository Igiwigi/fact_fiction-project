sheaths (the © epihyal ” and © cerato-hyal ” proper, ep./., c.h.). The rounded cerato-hyal
end fits into the cupped surface of the thick bulbous distal © hypohyal” (7.h.); there is no
joint cavity between them. There is a cavity, however, between the hypohyal and the
azygous piece, the keystone of the arch ; this is the 91os8al bone, or true © basihyal” (g.h.);
it has now a dentigerous bony lamina, its proper ectosteal plate, whilst the hypohyal,
$hort as it is, has two centres of ossification.

As this present paper is merely the first of a series which I hope to offer to the Royal
Society on the Fish's Skull, I shall refrain from making any SUMMARY. The Teleostean
must be studied in the light of the other ichthyic types; there is the more need
for this, as it is, indeed, the most specialized of all. When the © Marsypobranchs,”
< Elasmobranchs,” © Dipnoi,” and © Ganoids” are thoroughly worked ont it will be easy
to summarize the facts obtained. With regard to the Salmon itself, the reader is
referred to a very important work on its structure by Dr. Car Brvcn, © Vergleichende
Osteologie des Rheinlachses (Salmo salar, L.) mit besonderer Beriicksichtigung der
Myologie, nebst einleitenden Bemerkungen iiber die skelettbildenden ' Gewebe der
Wirbelthiere * (Mainz, 1861).
