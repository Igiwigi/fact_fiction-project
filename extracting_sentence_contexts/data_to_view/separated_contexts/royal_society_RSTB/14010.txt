One reason that human non-verbal vocalizations occur universally at some
level is because they directly evolved from behaviours in our mammalian
ancestors. The underlying brain mechanisms that generate emotional vocaliza-
tions, including distress calls, fear screams and threat displays, are shared
across virtually all mammalsâ€”it is part of what it means to be not only
human, but a mammal [7]. This fact makes questions of cultural universality
in human vocal communication seem narrower than some might imagine. In
the case of laughter, related vocalizations across diverse species reveal a long
evolutionary history of vocal play signalling (for a review, see [8]), bringing
some perspective to the question of why laughter in humans appears quite
similarly across cultures, and offering a framework for understanding how it
currently functions. But humans do possess a species-specific capability that
