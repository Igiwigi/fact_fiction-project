That snch a condition could be a primitive one seemed scarcely possible,

Still more remarkable did it appear, on the supposition that the primitive mode of
formation of these parts was represented in the developmental history of vertebrates,
that we should find similar structural elements in the central and in the peripheral
nervous systems.

The central nervous system arises from the epiblast, and yet contains precisely similar
nerve-cells and nerve-fibres to the peripheral neryous system, which, if derived, as is
uxually stated, from the mesoblast, was necessarily supposed to have a completely
different origin from the central nervous system.

Both of these difficulties are to a great extent remoyed by the facts of the deyelop-
ment of these parts in Elasmobranchs.

If it be admitted that the spinal roots develop as outgrowths from the central neryous
system in Elasmobranch Fishes, the question arises, how far it can be supposed to be
possible that in other vertebrates the spinal roots and ganglia deyelop independently of
the spinal cord, and only subsequently become united with it.

I have already insisted that this cannot be the primary condition ; and though I am
of opinion that the origin of the nerves in higher vertebrates ought to be worked over
again, yet I do not think it impossible that, by a secondary adaptation, the nerve-roots
might develop in the mesoblastF.
