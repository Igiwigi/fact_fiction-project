local supermarket, we are interacting not with a single individual, but rather with an entire
corporation full of individuals. One could take the view that if we were able to see the internal
workings of such a corporation, wealth and labour would be changing hands between individuals
internally, but the nature of transactions within a corporation is very different from that between
individuals outside of a corporation. In recent years, this has been studied in the context of
online gambling sites [13], and while the study of transactions in clustered networks is surely
an important future direction of research, we leave its application to the wealth distribution
modelling to future work.

In 2017, in an effort to make the YSM more realistic, Boghosian & co-workers [14] added two
features to it. The first of these was a simple model of redistribution that alone was sufficient
to suppress the tendency toward oligarchy. The second was a model of so-called Wealth-Attained
Advantage (WAA), which accounts for the fact that wealthier agents enjoy economic advantages
over poorer agents. The resulting two-parameter model, called the Extended Yard-Sale Model
(EYSM), was subsequently shown capable of describing empirical wealth distributions to an
accuracy of 2-3%. Most of the remaining discrepancy was due to the presence of negative-wealth
agents in empirical distributions who were not accounted for in the EYSM. In work by Li et al.
[13], a further modification to the EYSM was introduced in order to allow for negative-wealth
agents. The resulting three-parameter model is called the Affine Wealth Model (AWM), and has
been shown capable of describing empirical wealth distributions to an accuracy of less than a
quarter per cent for US wealth data.

(b) The economistsâ€™ perspective

To economists, the analogy between transacting agents and colliding molecules is controversial, to
