In the case when E = Ey Q -+ < cos *), for example, this product-becomes aw

taking ¢ less than 1. We observe, then, that this makes E, greater than Ey, which would correspond to Ey
in wood being greater than Ex, whereas the reverse holds in actual fact. We conclude
that any effect of the layers on the anisotropy of wood is quite overshadowed by the much
more important effect of the medullary rays. $17.
