60 MR. W. BEVAN LEWIS ON THE COMPARATIVE

RELATIVE INCREASE OF ConnectlVE MATRIX. Examination of the brain of animals below Man in the scale of organization shows
in a strikirg manner that the comparative amount of connective to nerve elements is
greatly increased. This fact TI have already drawn attention to in discussing the rela-
tive and absolute depth of the first layer of the cortex in different animalsâ€”a layer
which in all cases essentially consists of a larger amount of connective than the 8nb-
jacent strata. * MeyNErr also gives a table illustrative of this point. Independent
of the increase in relative and absolute depth of this layer, we have by these investi-
gations been taught to recognise a great increass in the quantity of the cellular
constituent of this matrix in the form of Derrer's corpuscles, which crowd the upper
regions of this layer.
