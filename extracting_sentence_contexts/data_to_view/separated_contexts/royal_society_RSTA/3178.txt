Letting Aj,
denote the Maslov index of I, with respect to the Dirichlet subspace D, we have

Ait + Ao. +A3i t+ Agi =0. (2.5)

Remark 2.9. The Maslov index counts signed crossings and so, in general, |Aj| is a lower
bound for the total number of crossings. However, lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 imply that the crossings
along any given Ij; are of the same sign, which means |Aj,| is in fact equal to the number of
crossings.

(b) No crossings on 1}, and 4,
We now show that A; =0 and, provided A. is large enough, Aq; =0. We use the following
result. Theorem 2.10 [29, theorem V.4.10].
