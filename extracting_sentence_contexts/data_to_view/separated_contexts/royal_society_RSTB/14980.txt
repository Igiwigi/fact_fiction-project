Mixotrophy covers: (i) phytoplankton taxa =
capable of phagotrophy of bacteria and small protists, (ii) phytoplankton species living in symbiosis with a heterotrophic host — 3'
(photosymbioses), and (iii) ‘heterotrophic’ organisms that can temporarily retain functional chloroplasts from their ingested a

algal preys (kleptoplastidy). The efficient recycling of organic and inorganic nutrients in these trophic modes can providea = 4
critical advantage under oligotrophic conditions. Furthermore, many microbial plankton are in fact unable to synthesize some of the compounds necessary for their growth, — w
in which case they are termed ‘auxotrophic’ for the metabolites concerned. Very often, the missing compound is acquired = s©
by exploiting the resources produced by other organisms in the community, or ‘ectocrines’ (see Box 1). This non-predatory, | &
mutualistic association among community members is designated as cross-feeding or syntrophy.
