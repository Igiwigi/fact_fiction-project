In contrast, the wrinkle zones are often not parallel and one may find wrinkle
zones close to each other, but oriented at differing angles. It has been observed that BslA forms
highly organized domains with neighbouring domains oriented at varying angles [30]. Therefore,
this observation may be explained by the fact that the BslA film is not a single contiguous layer
but consists of domains with varying orientational order. In this case, the propagation of stress
would not be homogeneous and could result in deformations such as those that we observed. With these caveats in place, let us assume that the deformations we observed are within the
linear regime, so that we can obtain an estimate of the bending elasticity from the expression
in equation (3.1) using the mean value of 4.
