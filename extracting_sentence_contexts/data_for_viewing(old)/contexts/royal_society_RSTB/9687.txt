tors: the method used for assessing cardiac function and the blinded or unblinded
nature of the trial. Namely, another almost as recent meta-analysis has also
concluded to the benefit of cell therapy, but exclusively when the functional
assessment was based on echocardiography which is known to be operator-
dependent, whereas the benefit was no longer significant when the analyses of
outcome were based on magnetic resonance imaging which provides more objec-
tive data [2]. Furthermore, the randomized trial mentioned above [1] indicates
that the benefits of cell therapy in terms of mortality, functional improvement
and increase in left ventricular ejection fraction are also no longer significant in
the subgroup of trials which have been blindly analysed. These comments
should not be interpreted as suggesting that there is no benefit to draw from car-
diac cell therapy in the context of heart failure. They simply call for some caution,
which is indeed consistent with the fact that if phase 2 clinical trials can give us a
suggested way forward, they are not tailored to conclusively establish that the
new therapy under investigation should be readily implemented in the clinics.
In the case of the treatment of heart failure by stem cells, it is indeed not so sur-
prising that the first wave of clinical trials have not yielded results matching
the initial expectations which were definitely excessive. The likely main reason
is that these early trials have been clouded by the uncertainty which then sur-
rounded the optimal cell type to be used as well as the most efficient method of
cell transfer. Lessons drawn from this early clinical experience, together with
the numerous laboratory data [3], now allow better clarification of these issues
and if these lessons can be appropriately translated in protocols which are in
preparation or already operative, there is a reasonable hope that the second
wave of clinical trials could be therapeutically more efficient, thereby allowing
