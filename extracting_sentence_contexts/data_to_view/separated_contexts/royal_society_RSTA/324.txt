For graphs with loops, the situation is more complex. Exact inference can still be performed
using techniques such as the junction tree algorithm [16], but the computational cost can become
prohibitive, depending on the structure of the graph. An alternative approach, known as loopy
belief propagation [17], uses the same message-passing technique as discussed earlier for tree-
structured graphs, but simply iterates the messages to allow for the fact that, with loops present,
a standard two-pass schedule does not lead to exact marginals. Although this process may seem
ad hoc, it has been found to yield good results in many applications. So far, we have assumed that the local messages at each node can be computed exactly.
