I have had occasion myself to observe its extreme utility at Holyhead and
the Kish light-vessel. The commanders of the Holyhead boats, moreover, are unanimous
in their commendation of the gun. An important addition in its favour is the fact that
the flash often comes to the aid of the sound: on this point the evidence cited in the
Appendix is quite conclusive. There may be cases in which the combination of the gun with one of the other signals
may be desirable. Where it is wished to confer an unmistakable individuality on a fog-
8ignal tation, 8uch a combination might with adyantage be resorted to.
