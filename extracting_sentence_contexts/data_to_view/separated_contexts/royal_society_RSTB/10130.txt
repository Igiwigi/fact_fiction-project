Importantly, visual cues were as effective as auditory ones
[79]. Furthermore, it was shown that conductors, even more
than musicians, are capable of precise synchronization with
an external visual stimulus. This fact suggests that orchestra
conductors are specifically tuned to the detection of salient kin-
ematic features of body gestures that allow temporal prediction
and estimation [80]. Interestingly, one study investigated the
perception of conductors’ body movements under different
viewing conditions. Video sequences presenting the conduc-
tors’ faces induced higher expressiveness ratings than the
arms-only conditions.
