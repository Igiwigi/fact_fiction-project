If this artificial assistance was prolonged, until the digested
aliment was prepared in sufficient amount to maintain the combustive process, they
recovered ; but if it was withdrawn too s0on, they died. —The bybernating species of
Mammalia differ from the rest essentially in this, that the lowering of the tempera-
ture of their bodies does not destroy their vitality, but merely suspends their activity,
50 that they are reduced for a time to a condition in all respects comparable to that
of cold-blooded animals but little removed above absolute torpidity; and in this
condition, all that has been said respecting the influence of external temperature upon
the rate of life of cold-blooded animals, applies to them also. The vast mass of facts, of which the foregoing are examples, appears to the author
to justify the conclusion, that Heat is something more than a stimulus capable of
arousing a dormant vital force; but, on the other hand, they by no means justify the
assumption that heat and the © vital principle ” are identical. That Heat, acting upon
or through an Organized structure, then manifests itself as Vital force, —or that heat

and vital force are © correlated,” —seems to be the expression of their mutual depend-
ence, which is most in accordance with all our knowledge of the influence of heat
upon organized beings; whilst conversely (as will be shown hereafter) it accords
with the fact of the restoration to the inorganic world—under some form or other—
of all the force thus withdrawn from it. It may serve, however, to bring this idea into contrast with the notions usually
entertained, and to illustrate its application more fully, if it be considered in its re-
lation to the Development of any highly organized being from its primordial germ-
cell. According to the doctrine current among some physiologists, the whole * or-
ganizing force,” © nisus formativus,” or © bildungstrieb,” which is to be exerted in
the development of the complete structure, lies dormant in this single cell, the germ
(it has been affirmed) being © potentially” the entire organism.
