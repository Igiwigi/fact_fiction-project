These experiments have been preferably made with chlo-

believe the devyelopement of acid is more easy than when the chloride of silver
is quite pure. The foregoing experiments have given me the most perfect conviction that
my estimate of the constitution of hornsilver, deduced from the researches pub-
lished in my last Essay, is in no wise vitiated by the fact noticed by Dr. ProuT.
But in order, on a point of s0 much practical and theoretical interest, not to
omit any evidence which might elucidate the subject, I endeavoured to analyse
corrosive sublimate by directly ascertaining the quantity of mercury which it
contains. For this purpose a quantity of grain tin was oxidized by nitric
acid, and the resulting oxide, after being washed and ignited, was reduced by
charcoal. The pure tin, after being granulated and washed, was dissolved in
strong muriatic acid.
