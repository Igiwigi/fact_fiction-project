- stituting therein for the coordinates their values at a given point, then to each of the N
Z values of the parameter there corresponds a system of q curves, only one of which
Z passes through the given point, the other qâ€”1 curves are curves not passing through
the given point, and having no proper connexion with the curves which satisfy this con-
< dition.

2 Returning to the proper representation of the series by means of an equation con-
5 taining the coordinates of the parametric point, say an equation (#L#, y, 1)" =0, in-
A volving the two coordinates (w, y), it is to be noticed that forming the derived equation
and eliminating the coordinates of the parametric point, we obtain an equation rational
in the coordinates (@, y), and also rational of the degree N in the differential coefficient

= in fact since the number of curves through any given point (a, Yo) is =N, the

differential equation must give this number of directions of passage from the point

d;
(2%, 4%) to a consecutive point, that is, it must give this number of values of =, and must

consequently be of the order N in this quantity.
