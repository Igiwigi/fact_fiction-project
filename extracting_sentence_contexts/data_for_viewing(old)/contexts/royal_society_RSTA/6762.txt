surface of the specimen, and residual stresses might also be expected to be present. Neverthe-
less, the observations of A, conformed surprisingly well to a theoretical relation assuming
ft = 1-24, particularly in view of the fact that this test was carried out without tilting one of
the end fittings, so that the central angle of twist was larger than in the previous tests. There
was close agreement between the theoretical and experimental buckling moments.

17. Discussion

A theoretical discussion has been given which enables the critical load causing lateral
buckling of a mild steel beam of rectangular cross-section to be predicted for those cases in
which the beam has partially yielded. The theory takes no account of strain hardening, for
it is assumed that indefinite extension or contraction of a longitudinal fibre can take place
under a constant stress, the lower yield stress. However, in many cases lateral buckling
would take place before extensions sufficiently large to cause strain hardening would occur.
