by 5-7 cm. in diameter and the secondary (ventral) 6 by 4:5 cm. Lastly, in the case
of Cebus apella 624 (with a haired foetus, C.R.L. 10-3 em. and D.C.L. 22-5 em. (Pl. 17,
fig. 99) ), the primary (dorsal) placenta measures 4-9 by 4-3 em. in diameter, and the

secondary, 5-6 by 4-1 cm. (Pl. 17, fig. 98). It is evident from these data that the
Platyrrhine placenta undergoes its greatest growth in what are relatively late foetal
stages, and it is an interesting fact that during this period also, as the sequel will show,
it attains its maximum grade of functional efficiency, so far as that may be judged from
its structural condition.

Apart from a definite increase in thickness, due to the growth and branching of the
villi, the placenta of Cebus 703 shows no very great advance on that of Chrysothrix 648.
The villous branches, though varying greatly in size, still tend to be coarse and very
variable in form. Remains of the cytotrophoblast are even more abundant than in
Chrysothrix 648, whilst the intervillous syncytium is still prominent, as irregular anasto-
mosing strands and masses, connecting the villous branches and ramifying between
them. It tends to be greatly thickened around the intraplacental vessels and in the
deep part of the placenta where large blood spaces are present it may form networks
connected with the basal syncytium. Below the chorion it is represented by irregular
