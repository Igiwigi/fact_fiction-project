Hemolytic Action.—In all of the four Viperine venoms dealt with there is
evidence of fairly well-marked hemolytic action, for if the fluid blood be allowed to
stand in a test-tube for 24 hours the red corpuscles will settle, and the uppers layers
will consist of heemoglobin-stained serum. Lamp (12) has recently studied this effect
and concludes that the hemolytic action of Daboia venom is more marked in vivo than
in vitro, while in the-ease of Cobra venom the reverse holds good. He regards the
fact that the blood-stained discharges in Daboia poisoning contain few red corpuscles
as evidence of marked hzemolytic action, but this must be largely due to the effusion
of serum brought about by the vaso-motor paralysis, which I have found to be the
most essential and constant action of Viperine poisons, and to their effect in dissolving
the walls of the small vessels, which we have next to discuss.

3. Hemorrhagic Effects.—In the records of the experiments recorded in this
paper we have repeatedly come across marked petechial hemorrhages, especially in
the mesentery and omentum, and in the peri- and endo-cardium, as well as less
frequently in the pleura. Here, again, we find great differences in degree in the case
of the several Viperine poisons examined.
