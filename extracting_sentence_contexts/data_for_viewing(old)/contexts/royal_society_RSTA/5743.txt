Coefficient A is determined by a formula derived on the basis of classical electrodynamics of
dielectric media as [35]:

(iy — 1¢)°(Nx — Nz)
[nz + (13 m@)Nsllng + (1 — mp)Nz]

(B1)

where nm, and ny are the refraction indices of the particle substance and the carrier fluid,
respectively; we set here that both media are optically isotropic. Whereas for the carrier medium
this is an evident assumption, for a ferrite like magnetite or maghemite this is justified by the
fact that either oF those has. a cubic crystalline lattice. According to the standard electrodynamic
conventions, ny =€p and n2= = ef are the dielectric permeabilities of the respective media at the
frequency of light. Factors Nz and Ny in formula (B 2) are the components of demagnetizing tensor
of a spheroidal particle along its major (z) and minor (x) axes.
