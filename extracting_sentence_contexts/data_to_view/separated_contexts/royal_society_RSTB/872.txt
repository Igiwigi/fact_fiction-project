To argue the non-relationship of sugar to glycogen |
for this reason is as absurd as to argue the non-relationship of mucin and the zymins
to the mucinogen and the zymogens, because, in the prolonged activity of the cells,
these latter bodies are not accumulated and stored. ‘

Against the experimental basis of the second objection must be set the observations”
of Boru and Horrmayn (‘Pfliiger’s Archiv,’ vol. 23) and of Grrarp (‘ Pfliiger's”
Archiv, vol. 41), which clearly indicate that the amount of sugar formed in the
liver post-mortem is proportionate to the glycogen disappearing. H

But even supposing that SrEGEN and KRATSCHMER’s results are correct, they by no_
means justify the conclusions founded upon them. The fact that glycogen is formed,
not only from carbohydrates, but also from proteids, and the possibility that the vital
functions of the cells of the body are continued for some time after the death of the

animal, might explain the post-mortem production of the slightly increased amount of

carbohydrates found by these investigators.*
With such conclusive evidence, further experiments are needless. é
Glycogen being the forerunner of sugar, the problem of glycogenesis resolves itself

into :—
Ist. From what and how is glycogen formed in the liver ? j
¥

ond. How is it related to the protoplasm of the liver cells ?
