For it is easy to calculate that there are three independent quadrics through the
first four planes of the double four on V,*, and these quadrics necessarily contain the
second four planes and meet V;* in just these eight planes. Hence there must be two
independent quadrics which contain V,‘ entirely, 7.e., 2 and one other, 2’, as stated. It is known in fact, that there are ~* quadrics through a Veronese surface§ : and these
meet Q in the »* V5"’s corresponding to the primes of 8. To the point P of § there corresponds some point P’ of 2; and we now project Q
from P’ on to a [4]. S then is in bi-rational correspondence with = ; and to quadrics
of ® there correspond prime sections of 2 which pass through P’ and project into
the primes of .
