$f quadrant is considerable and of the same sign, it cannot be as8umed that the deflection

for a given difference is the same as if the charges were small, or of equal and opposite

Sign ; in fact, if the potentials of the quadrant and the jar of the electrometer are of

the same sign, the sensibility of the instrument will be diminished (vide Maxwell's -
* Blectricity and Magnetism,‚Äù vol. i. p. 273). On this account the results for 4(7) given

below should be increased by about Fs part of their value. The experiment consisted

in insulating the flask from the battery, and observing the difference of potential between

the flask and the battery after a suitable interval.

The flask was charged and instantly insulated at 8.25 p.x. The image traversed
164 divisions in 10 seconds. The flask was again connected with the battery, and insu-
