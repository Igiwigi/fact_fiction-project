This interpretation is consistent with the
diffuse source network including auditory cortex, hippo-
campus and inferior frontal gyrus identified in [19] as
contributing to the brain response to structured sequences. To summarize, a picture emerges from these results in
which regularity in non-attended items does not capture atten-
tion. In fact, as demonstrated in Experiment 2, random stimuli
can be more distracting than regular ones. Consistent with the
literature, we found that regularity does, however, aid in scene
analysis by being easier to ignore (Experiment 2) and requiring
fewer resources to process (Experiment 3). Collectively, the be-
havioural and brain imaging findings can be reconciled by
considering both to result from mechanisms that minimize
surprise and uncertainty about the world [10,25].
