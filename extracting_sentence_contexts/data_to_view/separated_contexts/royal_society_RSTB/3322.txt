Blutmenge und der Stoffwechsel yon dem Jugendzustande an , d. h. mit
dem steigenden Kérpergewichte, ab.” This fact, that small animals contain a relatively greater amount of blood than
larger ones of the same species, is in accordance with the results obtained by the
greater number of observers (WeLCKER, RANKE, MALAssez, SHERRINGTON and
CoremaN, etc., although, in expressing their view, they put it in the form that young
animals contain relatively more blood), but it is in absolute disagreement with
Boycorr and Doveuas’ results, as obtained by using HaLpANe and Lorrain Smrra’s
modification of GreHANT and Quinquaup’s CO method. In a preliminary communication, dealing with the blood volume and the total
amount of agglutinin which could be recovered from immunised animals, we
expressed the view that the blood volume of normal healthy rabbits was a function of
the surface and not of the body weight, that is to say that with an increase of the
body weight there is a decrease in the percentage amount of blood per kilo, and
expressed it in the formula

B= Wk,

where B is the blood volume in cubic centimetres, W the weight of the animal in
grammes, and / a constant calculated from the experiments. DETERMINED BY EXPERIMENTS UPON RABBITS, GUINEA-PIGS, AND MICE.
