plane is an E-conic plane, and any one of its E-conics makes up an H-cubic of the
system c¢, with a certain line of the plane ['T, 1,] and it makes up an E-cubic of the
system (c)) with a certain line of the plane ['T, l.]. Hence to the three planes {t, TP},
{T, 1}, {T, ls} there corresponds the same line « ; and « must lie on each of the planes o,,
62; and it is in fact the directrix of the cubic surface T. As to the last statement every
generator of [ corresponds to an E-conic plane through T meeting 1,, 1, and 4; and each

such plane meets {T, /,} and {T, /,} in a pair of lines making up one of its degenerate
E-conics. We find further without any trouble that meets o, and oy in lines y, and
Y2 respectively, as well as in its directrix « ; and that Q meets the same planes in lines
61, ®, respectively which meet in the point O of « corresponding to the line R, Ry.
