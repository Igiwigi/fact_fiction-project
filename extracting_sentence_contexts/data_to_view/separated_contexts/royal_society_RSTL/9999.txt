N. PARKER ON THE

To the distinctive set of characters given by MbrLER we may probably add
following —

(1.) Oviducts and urinary ducts always unite, and open by a common urinogen!
aperture behind the anus.

(2.) Skull hyostylic.

(3.) Segmentation complete in the types 80 far investigated, though perhaps 4:
may be found to resemble the Teleostei in this particular.

(5.) A pronephros of the Teleostean type present in the larya.

(6.) Thalamencephalon very large and well developed.

(7.) The ventricle in the posterior part of the cerebrum is not divided behind inf
lateral halves, the roof of the undivided part being extremely thin.

(8.) Abdominal pores always present. The great number of characters just given are amply sufficient to differentiate the
Ganoids as a group ; but, curiously enough, the only characters amongst the whole
series which have been given, which can be regarded as peculiar to the Ganoids, are
(1) the characters of the brain, and (2) the fact of the oviducts and kidney ducts
uniting together and opening by a common pore to the exterior. This absence of characters peculiar to the Ganoids is an indication” of how widely
8eparated in organisation are the different members of this great group. At the same time, the only group with which existing Ganoids have close affinities
is the Teleostei.
