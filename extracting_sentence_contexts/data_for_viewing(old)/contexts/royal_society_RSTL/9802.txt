that direction, and 80 return to the place from which it started. All these movements,
standing in such marked contrast to those exhibited by unmutilated specimens under
similar circumstances, prove that the co-ordination of the ambulacral feet has been
destroyed. On the other hand, the fact that they continue able to act at all proves
that their activity is not wholly dependent upon the nerye-centre ; all that the des-
truction of this centre entails is the destruction of their power of co-ordinated action.

When perfectly fresh and vigorous specimens are inverted, a proportion of about
three to four remain permanently inverted till they die. As this is never the case
with perfectly fresh and vigorous specimens when unmutilated, there can be no
question that destruction of the nerve-centre exerts a profound influence on the action
of the ambulacral feet upon which the execution of the righting mancuvre depends.
On the other hand, the fact that a certain proportion of individuals continue able to
execute this manceuvre after destruction of the nerve-centre—although they never do
80 without much difficulty and great expenditure of time—proves that the integrity of
this centre is not absolutely essential to the execution of this manceuyre. Therefore,
as experiment has failed to reveal to us any other general nerye-centre in the animal,
and as even a segment of the animal containing but a single row of feet is in many
cases able to perform this manceuvre, we conclude, as previously stated, that the
action of the feet in performing these righting movements js partly of a serial cha-
racter, although, for reasons mentioned in the two previous paragraphs, we further
conclude that in the unmutilated animal these movements are largely assisted by the
co-ordinating influence that emanates from the nervous centre.
