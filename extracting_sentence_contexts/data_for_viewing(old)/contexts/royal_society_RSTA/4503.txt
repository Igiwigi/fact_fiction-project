Figure 10. MALDI-TOF spectrum of PHA-HEMA. Different species can be identified: (n), (x) and (y) are telechelic chains; (m) and
(z) are monofunctional chains.

Although the intensity of the AB-type polymer peaks is quite high, it should be noted that
this analysis is not quantitative; thus the size of the peaks does not indicate absolute quantities
but only how effectively different fragments are ionized and fly down the MALDI-TOF [11,68].
In fact, the non-functional AB-type chains represent around 18% of the product, as calculated
from 'H-NMR by analysis of the ratio between the peaks at 4.20 ppm and 3.65 ppm (figure 62).
Therefore, the targeted telechelic polyester represents more than 80% of the final product.

Finally, the spectrum of PHA-HEMA shows once again the dynamic nature of lipase-catalysed
polyesterifications (figure 10). Five different species can be identified: three are difunctional and
two monofunctional. These structures are differentiated by the presence or the absence of ethylene
glycol units, thus confirming the 1H-NMR results described previously (figure 6b). Nonetheless,
non-functionalized structures were not detected; therefore, all the polymer chains that are
produced can participate in radical cross-linking reactions leading to useful functional materials.
