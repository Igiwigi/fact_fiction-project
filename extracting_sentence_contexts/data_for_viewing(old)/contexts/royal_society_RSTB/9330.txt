and patrigenic alleles are often identical by descent and intra-
genomic conflict is greatly attenuated. Fukomys damarensis is a
social mole-rat with extensive outbreeding and multiple pater-
nity within litters [128], whereas blind mole-rats (Spalax spp.)
are solitary with very low rates of cancer [129]. Studies of
these and other species should illuminate whether mating
system affects cancer rates.

Each species has its own distinctive spectrum of cancers
[130]. Breast cancers, for example, kill many women but
have not been reported in great apes [131]. Such differences
argue for taxon- and organ-specific risks that may be devel-
opmental or environmental in origin. The fact that the rates
of different kinds of cancer do not vary in unison across phy-
logeny argues against overly simplistic theories in which all
cancers have a common cause.
