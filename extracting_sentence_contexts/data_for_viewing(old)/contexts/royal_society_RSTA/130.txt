Clauser chart ought to be particularly kept in mind.

The general second point of Nagib et al. (2007) concerns the support of recen
hot-wire data at high Reynolds numbers, such as those acquired at Kungliga
Tekniska Hogskolan (KTH) and in the National Diagnostic Facility (NDF) a
the Illinois Institute of Technology (Osterlund et al. 2000), for classical
conclusions concerning mean-velocity scaling and integral parameters. One o
their important inferences is that the log law with a Karman constant of 0.384 is
the correct velocity distribution in the overlap region. Their Karman constant is
smaller than the accepted value of ca 0.4, which itself is smaller than the value o
0.42 advocated by researchers working with the Superpipe. It is heartening tha’
one can, these days, have enough confidence in measurements to claim that 0.38
and 0.42 are, in fact, different without rounding them both off to a ‘universal’
value of 0.4. If further assessments support these claims, it is apparent, at the
least, that the log law, if it exists, is not universal.

Another point of emphasis placed in this paper is the excessive slowness with
which the normalized properties of the boundary layer, such as the shape factor
and the skin-friction coefficient, decay with the Reynolds number. This aspect is,
of course, evident from the many empirical correlations in vogue, but to see
several of them plotted on a single graph paper is quite revealing. It is
particularly interesting to note that, while several existing empirical correlations
agree with each other, as well as with the existing data, over the available span
(Reg< 10*, say), they diverge significantly from one another beyond this realm.
One does not therefore have a good guidance as to which, if any, of the several
