The collection of South Australian skulls in the University Museum numbers some
12 specimens, picked up at random by different observers at various localities in
Victoria ; eight of them are skulls of men, three of women, and one of a youth of
about 14 years of age ; the male skulls may be considered separately. As a preliminary, we must first consider our choice of a base, and this renders it
necessary to discuss the significance of the nasi-inion line. The inion is a feature
which owes the greater part of its importance to the fact that by a piece of
extraordinary good fortune it is preserved in the Neandertal calotte, and thus
affords a welcome means of comparison, but it has acquired a connotative significance
of perhaps deeper import, since it has been brought into connection with the form of
the brain; thus Huxiey writes: “... when I had placed the outline of the
Neandertal skull against that of the Engis skull, in such a position that the glabella
and occipital protuberance (inion) of both were intersected by the same straight line,
the difference was so vast and the flattening of the Neandertal skull so prodigious
... that Tat first imagined I must have fallen into some error. And I was the
more inclined to suspect this as in ordinary human skulls the occipital protuberance
and superior semicircular curved line on the exterior of the occiput correspond pretty
closely with the ‘lateral sinuses’ and the line of attachment of the tentorium
internally. But on the tentorium rest ... the posterior lobes of the brain, and
hence the occipital protuberance and the curved line in question indicate approwi-
mately the lower limits of that lobe.
