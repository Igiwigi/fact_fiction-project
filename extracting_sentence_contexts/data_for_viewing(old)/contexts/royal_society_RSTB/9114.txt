Group 2L pigs with domestic tooth shape were identified in
the Early Neolithic Magura—Boldul lui Mos Ivanus and at
Carcea La Hanuri. Although these failed to yield DNA, we
obtained DNA from two Early Neolithic specimens (two
wild boars identified using GMM and one young individual
possessing only M1 and dp4, and therefore not included in
GMM analysis), both of which carried the E1-C haplotype.
This haplotype is identical to one identified in a group 2L
pig, possessing a domestic tooth shape, from the Middle
Neolithic, indicating its direct affinity with local wild boar
(figure 2 and electronic supplementary material, figure S6).
In fact, we observe a close genetic affinity between local wild
boar and group 2L pigs possessing domestic tooth shape signa-
tures across all time periods in which these groups coexisted
(figure 2).

The combined GMM and aDNA data (electronic sup-
plementary material, table S4) demonstrate that Neolithic—
Chalcolithic group 1S pigs almost exclusively possessed the
Y1 haplotype, suggesting genetic continuity between Near
Eastern populations [11] and the early European domestic
population in Romania. The Y1 haplotype was also observed
in two Middle Chalcolithic specimens with large molars and
domestic shape from the sites of Luncavita and Bordusani,
