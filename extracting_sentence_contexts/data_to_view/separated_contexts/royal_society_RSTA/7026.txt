Tf-for some P, the least of the above intercepts is OP, then the lattice Y’, generated by P and an end-point
of this intercept, is admissible if £' has no point other than O, inside R. In lemma 16 it will be proved that there exist lines P,P, and P,P, equal and parallel to
OP such that P, and P, lie on @, while P, and P, lie on @. Then the equivalence of the above
with theorem 3 follows from the fact that, if a line moves towards O parallel to itself, its
intercept on @, or @, does not increase.

Lemma 16. For all points P on @, between H, and I, there exists

(1) a line P,P,, equal and parallel to OP with P, and P, on ©, and

(it) a line P,P, equal and parallel to OP with P, and P, on @ 5.
