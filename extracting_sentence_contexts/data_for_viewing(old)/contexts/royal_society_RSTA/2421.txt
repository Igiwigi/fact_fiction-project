(4) Increasing the counter i in theorem 4.2 yields larger delay values. If by design, h should

not be larger than an upper bound Imax, e.g. due to memory considerations, then /min <
h <hmax can be used as a constraint when tuning the PR parameters.

Remark 4.3. It is worthy of mention that if 42, 43 are in complex conjugate form, but the
remaining eigenvalues are all real, then theorem 4.2 will still guarantee the rightmost position of
the characteristic root. This is in some sense due to the fact that the complex conjugate nature
of eigenvalues and the eigenvalues with the smallest positive real part determine the worst
case scenario in a factor. For the more complicated cases, where 42 is real and the remaining
eigenvalues are a mix of real and complex numbers, the PR-design problem remains open.
A unified framework is to be constructed in future work by combining the results in this
manuscript with those in [17].

5. Case studies

Now that the PR tuning methodology is established, we next verify the theoretical results via
numerical examples. Since the developments are fully analytical, theorem 4.2 must guarantee
the exact placement of the spectral abscissa. For simplicity, agentsâ€™ coupling strengths are taken
to be homogeneous ayy = 1 subject to G. To emulate the availability of the initial conditions in
