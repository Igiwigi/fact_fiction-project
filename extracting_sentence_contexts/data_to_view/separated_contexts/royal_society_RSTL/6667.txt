But in general no one of these lines meets the curye in a fourth point ; that
is, we cannot through every point of the curve m draw a line through four points ; there
are, however, on the curye m2 a certain number ( =4G(m)) of points through which can
be drawn a line through four points, or line G(m*).

17. But the curve 1m may be such that through every point of the curve there passes
a line through four points. In fact, assxume any skew surface or scroll whateyer, and
upon this surface a curve meeting each generating line in four points (e. g. the intersec-
tion of the scroll by a quartic surface). Taking the curve in question for the curye m,
then it is clear that through every point of this curye there passes a line (the generating
line of the assumed scroll) which is a line through four points, or line G(m*). MR.
