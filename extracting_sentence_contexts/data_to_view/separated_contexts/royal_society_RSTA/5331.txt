One lesson learned repeatedly through
the data challenges was that, if a system or procedure had not been tested at
large scale, it would not work first time at large scale. All dimensions are relevant
here: number of systems, sites or users, length of time for an operation, numbers
of files or volume of data. Many of the problems encountered are obvious after
the fact, but limits and thresholds, particularly in distributed systems, are not
always obvious until they are encountered. Through this period, there were a number of experiment-based initiatives to
improve the performance and reliability of Tier-1 and Tier-2 sites. In CMS,
specific task forces were launched to help debug and monitor networking
connections and to set up physics analysis processing at Tier-2 sites.
