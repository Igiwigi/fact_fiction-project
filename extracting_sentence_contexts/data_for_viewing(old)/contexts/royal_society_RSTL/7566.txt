of an hour. It will be observed that the earliest and latest hours of maxima differ b
about seven hours in the case of E,, and by only one hour twelve minutes in the case of

The values in the last line of the Table are derivable either from the last line
Table 11. or from the means of the yalues of P,, Q,, P,, Q,. The amplitudes of the
diurnal and semidiurnal terms are, it will be seen, nearly equal. Practically, the hours
of electrical maxima month by month agree, within an hour or two, with those of the
Semidiurnal term, and the hourly values for the average of the year, given in the lask
line of Table IT., show a still closer agreement. The diurnal term, without having much
effect on the times of maxima, causes one maximum to be much greater than the other.

It may be interesting to inquire into the connexion, if any, between electrical and
barometrical maxima, an inquiry which is suggested by the fact that the latter, like the
former, occur twice in the twenty-four hours. In default of the necessary barometric
data for Kew, I have compared the numbers in the last line of Table II. with the fol-
lowing numbers which represent the mean heights of the barometer at Halle for all
hours on the average of the whole year, and are taken from KArMTz's * Meteorology,"
