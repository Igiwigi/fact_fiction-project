(a.) Head and Eyes.â€”It is well worth while to shortly review the so-called
voluntary or purposive movements in the light of the facts detailed in the foregoing
pages. In the first place, rotation of the head and eyes to one side is a necessary
accompaniment of all the highest movements. This will probably explain the fact
that this rotation of the head and eyes is represented over the whole breadth of the
hemisphere reaching from near to the fissure of Sytvrus below to the middle line
above. It is thus in close apposition, from below upwards, to the areas for the face,
the upper, and the lower limbs, respectively. It is, moreover, the area which inter-
venes between the presumably higher psychical centres of the prefrontal region and
the lower areas for the face and limbs; hence, it seems probable that impulses
proceeding from these higher centres will traverse the area for the head and eyes on
their way to the areas for the limbs.
