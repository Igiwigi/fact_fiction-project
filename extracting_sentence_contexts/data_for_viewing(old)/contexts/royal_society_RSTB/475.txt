After sending in the foregoing paper to the Royal Society my attention was
drawn, on March 6, to a paper published in A. ScunerpeEr’s ‘ Zool. Beitriige, 1885—
“ Das Respirationssystem der Symphylen und Chilopoden,” by Dr. E. von Haase.

This paper anticipates my own in the following particulars :—

In the description of the air-sac.

In the description of the branching of the tubes and the way in which the tubes
end.

In the fact that the blood is arterial in the heart.

In the statement that blood does not circulate between the individual trachee.

In the fact that each respiratory arrangement may be considered as a single
organ, and that this organ is intermediate between the tracheal lungs of
Spiders and the true trachee of Spiders.

My paper is untouched in the important point of the arrangement for the supply of
blood to the end of every tube, which renders the organ sufficient for the whole
function of respiration, whereas Dr. von Haass, on p. 75 of his paper, doubts
whether the respiration is carried on by the organ ulone, or whether there is not
some supplementary means of breathing.
