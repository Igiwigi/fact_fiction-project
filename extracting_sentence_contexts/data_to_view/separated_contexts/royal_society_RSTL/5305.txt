logous to different musical notes in the phenomenon of sound. To this I reply, that the phases of mazime vis viva will succeed with equal rapidity
in both cases, which is a complete answer to the objection. In fact, if we adopt the hypothesis of a rippled front, the vis viva due to any transverse
section as it enters the pupil, will have for its expression an integral of the form
