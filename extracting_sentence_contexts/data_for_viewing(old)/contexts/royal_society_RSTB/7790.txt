which rise up gradually in a ventral direction and end with an abrupt vertical face. The
spines are spaced about 1-7 mm. apart in the adult shell. Intervals carrying fine, closely
spaced, slightly raised concentric threads which are somewhat convex on their ventral
side, and about 8 in } mm. in number.

Dimensions. Holotype: length 10-4 mm.; height 9-6 mm.; thickness (both valves)
7-5 mm.

Remarks. Although the hinge is not seen, and although the shell is less trapezoidal-in
outline and the umbos not so large as in Cardium hatchetigbeense Aldrich from the Eocene
of Alabama (the type species of Schedocardia), the Pakistan species is referred to the subgenus
Schedocardia on account of the nature of the ornament (evidently an important criterion in
the classification of the members of the Cardiidae), and of the fact that it is a little wider
than high. Stewart (1930) states that ‘the name Schedocardia is probably better used only
for the American species and possibly species from the Burman and Japanese Eocene
mentioned under P. brewerii’. The Japanese species is Cardium mitkense Nagao, and the
Burmese species is C. thetkegyinense Cotter. As far as the Burmese species is concerned, there
are never any spines present, even on well-preserved specimens, and the species appears
more likely to be a Trachycardium. The presence of the subgenus Schedocardia in the Eocene of
Western Pakistan is, however, by no means surprising.
