In contrast to OC-Fer, the spatial distribution of the OC fraction of the total sedimentary OC
pool bound to Fer (fOC-Fer) (figure 6f) shows no relationship to either TOC or Fer contents
and, therefore, does not show a spatial south-north gradient. Also, an association to sea ice
cover, proximity to land, grain size distribution or sediment composition were not identified
either. In fact, the fraction of OC bound to Fer in the southern Barents Sea is very similar
to that in the northern Barents Sea region (figure 6f), even though sample locations are very
different in terms of their environmental settings, sediment sources, OC and Fer contents (see
discussion above). Thus, a relatively high fraction of OC can be bound to Fer even if absolute
Fer contents are relatively low. This suggests that the amount of OC bound to reactive iron is
