RocnLeperÂ®* and others have already
advanced it as an hypothesis. Indeed the former appears inclined to attribute the evo-
lution of carbonic acid to this cause, even in s8ome cases where it is ordinarily regarded
as a direct product of the s0-called plant respiration. Moreover there are several facts
in the known chemistry of plant-growth which harmonize with this view. It is easily
een that the subtraction of the elements of carbonic acid from any vegetable principle
will have the result of leaving a residue richer in both carbon and hydrogen, and hence
of higher force-yalue. There are grounds for believing that woody tissue is derived from the starch secreted
under the influence of sunlight in the leaves of the plant.
