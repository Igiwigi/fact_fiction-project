466, 467) deserves special notice in this connection. He was able to show, by means of methylene blue preparations, that in the
embryonic lobster there are on the ventral surface of the brain two (a pair) large cells,
from each of which a moderately thick fibre arises, crosses to the opposite side, and
leaves the brain by the cesophageal connective. On entering the first thoracic ganglion
these two fibres become very broad, having a diameter many times greater than that
of any other fibre in the body; they are, in fact, the giant fibres. They run the
whole length of the nerve cord to the last (sixth abdominal) ganglion, in which they
divide into several branches. *
