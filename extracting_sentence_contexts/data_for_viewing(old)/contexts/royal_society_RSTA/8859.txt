214 MR. BE, A. MILNE ON RADIATIVE EQUILIBRIUM.

The rows marked (ii) in Table I. give the darkening calculated from this formula with
u = 0-56 and T, = 4830° as before. The agreement with the observed values is quite
good, except for the last column.* Thus, if a slight empirical change in the temperature
distribution from that given by strict radiative equilibrium is made, emission and
absorption on simple black body principles is competent to explain the intensity
distribution. The exact significance of this result is difficult to state, and it is perhaps
dangerous to press the agreement; also the difficulty raised above as to the form of
the spectrum still remains ; but the fact that the agreement results from the assumption
of a coeflicient of absorption independent of wave-length, combined with a use of the
numerical form of PLANCK’s law, should not be lost sight of.

It may at first sight seem a numerical error that for the last column the calculated values should almost
all exceed the observed, when the integrated radiation has been made to agree, but it can be shown that
this is quite possible when the form of the energy curve is taken into account. For if i, (@) is the actual
intensity, I, (#) the calculated, we have to show that the condition
