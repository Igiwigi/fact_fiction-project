a general mitosis stimulator such as oestrone, for this abnormal activity is unrelated to the
oestrous cycle, it affects cells which are normally almost, if not entirely, inert, and it is
strictly local. Its action is not prevented or hindered by cell inertia because all cells,
however variable they may normally be in their reactions to oestrogenic hormones, react
simultaneously and fully when in the vicinity of a wound, and neither is it subject to the
restriction of a mitosis depressor because the mitotic activity continues until after the
wound is closed. This last point was well illustrated by two mice which, owing to constant
scratching, were slow in wound closure. In these mice, even after a week, mitotic activity
continued to be abnormally high in all cells.

The conclusions are reached that the agent responsible for the mitotic activity comes
from the wound itself, and that it does not exert its effect in the same way as an oestrogen.
The facts are more easily explained by a theory that the wounded tissue emits not a
mitosis stimulator, but something which eliminates cell inertia from all the neighbouring
cells. Thus, whatever may be their normal reactions to the oestrogens, all cells are now
able to react fully and simultaneously to the presence of even minimal concentrations of
these hormones, and in the same way the action of any mitosis depressor is prevented for
as long as the wound remains open.

(ii) Mammary cancer

Mitotic activity is cyclic in the ducts, as well as in the secretory cells, of the normal
mammary gland, a maximum rate of cell division occurring on the third day of dioestrus
and again in late oestrus, while in a mammary carcinoma the rate of division of the
malignant cells is rapid and sustained. In the normal gland, mitosis is kept under control
