gressive changes of form in the blood of the Paco is peculiarly interesting.

87. The transition from the circular to the oval shape presented by the © red cor-
puscle” of the Paco, is analogous to that which we have seen presented by the red
nucleated cell of the oviparous Vertebrata. It is also worthy of remark, that like
the latter the oval red corpuscle of the Paco is reduced to a circular form by the
action of water (fig. 31.). The progressive degrees of coloration are also analogous
to what are presented by the nucleated cells of the blood of the oviparous Vertebrata.
But it is curious to observe, that whilst among the Mammifera the attainment of the
oval form by the * red corpuscle” is exceptional, among the oviparous Vertebrata
the attainment of the oval form by the red nucleated cell is the rule.

88. But to return to the bearing of the facts I have now related on the question
before us. They show that originally the © red corpuscles*” of the Paco are of a cir-
cular form like the © red corpuscles” of other mammifera, but that whilst the latter
remain circular, the former gradually acquire an oval shape. From this it follows that
the circular form of the cellzeform nucleus of the nucleated cell of the blood of the

Paco, 0 far from being an objection to the view of the nature of the © red corpuscle”

* In their original circular form they are as yet uncoloured.
