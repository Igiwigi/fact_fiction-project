In our example, these constraints should apply to A and X, the coupling counterparts of Ra
and Roa ) measuring (answering) the same question q in two different contexts. Intuitively, ‘non-contextuality’ means ‘independence of context’, and because of this it is
tempting to say that the system of two bunches in (1.1) is non-contextual if we can consider Ra
and Ro ) as ‘one and the same’ random variable, Rj. This may appear simple, but in fact it is

logically impossible: since Rw and Rw are stochastically unrelated, they cannot be ‘the same’. A random variable cannot be stochastically unrelated to itself. The precise meaning here comes
from considering couplings (A,B, X, Y) for the two bunches.
