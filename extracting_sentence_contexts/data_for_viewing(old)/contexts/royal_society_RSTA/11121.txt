§ 60. Comparing first the partial coefficients with negative universes, | AB|y5|,
&c., with the total coefficients, we see that in every case, without exception, the
partial coefficient is greater than the total. Hence it cannot be true that any one ot
the defects noted is, or is even indicative of, a necessary connecting link between any
other two. That low nutrition brings on at once development defects and nerve
signs, or development defects and dulness, so that we find these pairs associated is,
for instance, a hypothesis that may be partly true but is insufficient to explain the
facts observed. Dr. WanrNeEr’s hypothesis that “ the connecting link between defects
of body and defective mental action is the coincident defect of brain which may be
known by observation of ‘abnormal nerve-signs’”* seems to me equally untenable ;
it may be so in some cases, but on the other hand the “connecting link” may be a
defect of brain not indicated by abnormal nerve signs, or not a defect of brain at all.
The demonstration of a necessary connecting link X between A and B would, it
seems to me, only be complete when |AB|£| was shown to be small compared with
|AB|; the demonstration that either X, or X, or X, or X, had to be present as a
connecting link would only be complete if |AB|& & & ... &,| were shown to be
small (zero within the limits of error). Now |AB|y8|, |AC| 88], &c., are not small
but even larger than | AB], | AC], &., hence CD, BD, &c., cannot be necessary even
as alternative connecting links or symptoms of such links in the way described
above ; the case must be much more complex and depend on a much greater variety
