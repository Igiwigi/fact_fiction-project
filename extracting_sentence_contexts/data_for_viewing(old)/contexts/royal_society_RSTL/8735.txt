nuclei which are readily stained with carmine. The structures in question not only
differ from lymph-corpuscles in shape, but they also show a great difference in their
contentsâ€”the contents of the former being highly refractive bodies in the state of
division, which are not stained with carmine at all.

From all this it is probable that they are not lymph-corpusecles ; and therefore it is

not impossible that they do not belong to the tissue of the skin itself, but that they
perhaps correspond to what Harrier calls Cryptococeus. This is also supported, to a
certain extent, by the fact that I found them chiefly in those parts of the subcutaneous
tisxue which (as I could make out from seyeral circumstances) had been penetrated by
the canula of the injecting-syringe when the inoculation with lymph was performed.
The most important characteristics of this stage of the disease, however, are those
which depend on the changes in the lymphatic vessels in the deeper part of the corium.
The lymphatic vessels (those accompanying blood-yessels and filled more or less with
lymph-corpuscles, as well as the others) are, as stated aboye, distended, and from this
S reason, as well as from the lymph-canalicular system being also distended, are distinctly

S canalicular system.
Many of these lymphatics contain a material which, as represented in Plate 31. figs. 9,
= 7,&8, is composed of a transparent matrix, in which lie imbedded highly refractive
