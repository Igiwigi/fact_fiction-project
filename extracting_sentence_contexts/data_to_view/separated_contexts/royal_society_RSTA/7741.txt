The discrepancy between the two is due to a mean value of ¢ having been used in
the former procedure. DiscusstON OF PROBABLE ERRORS

45—With the additional local stations it is clear that the p.e. of Ar will be con-
siderably smaller than that estimated in § 38 for a simple world survey, viz., 34 feet. In fact we must form the values of F,2/K’ (with K’ replacing K of Table IV), where
K’ is the enlarged number of stations. The result is a probable error of 23 feet
in Ar.

46—All the estimates of probable error are essentially based on the error of repre-
sentation, expressed by (29.5). This is in turn based on observational results from
a belt of 8° of latitude extending over 14° of longitude ; and it is subject to some
increase or decrease when data elsewhere are sufficient to admit of similar treatment.
