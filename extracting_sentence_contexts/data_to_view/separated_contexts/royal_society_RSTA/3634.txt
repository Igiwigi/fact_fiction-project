Owing to the extreme care with which this
particular sample was handled, the halite is clearly indigenous to the clast and thus the Zag clast
and halite are linked. Because both Zag and Monahans are H chondrite regolith breccias, it is logical to examine
other H chondrites (at least). In fact, a Cl-like clast has been reported in the Tsukuba H chondrite
[69], and the recently fallen Carancas H chondrite contains another [68]. The clasts in Tsukuba and
Carancas appear to be mineralogically identical to the Zag clast. We suspect that this material was
relatively widespread in the Solar System, but that its friability has generally prevented survival
in meteorites.
