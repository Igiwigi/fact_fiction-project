order, I shall detail in the following 'sections, particularly
those which demonstrate the decomposition and composition
of the fixed alkalies; and the production of the new and ex-
traordinary bodies which constitute their bases.

In speaking of novel methods of investigation, I shall not
ſear to' be minute.” When'the common means of chemical
research have been employed; I shall mention'only results. A
historical detail of the progress of the investigation, of all the
difficulties that occurred; and” of the manner in which they
were overcome, and of 'all the manipulations employed,
would far exceed the limits assigned to this Lecture. It is
proper to state, however, that when general facts are men-
tioned, they are such only as have been deduced from pro=
cesses carefully performed and often repeated.

II. On the Methods used for the Decomposition of the fixed
Alkaltes,

The researches I had made on the decomposition of acids,
and of alkaline and earthy neutral. compounds, proved that
the powers of electrical decomposition were proportional to
the strength of the opposite electricities in the circuit, and
