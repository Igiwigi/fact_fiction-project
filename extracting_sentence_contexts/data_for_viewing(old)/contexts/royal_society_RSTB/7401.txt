Because of this further tests were made to discover whether a sample of fifty-five chim-
panzee teeth chosen at random from our records, by means of Fisher & Yates’s (1948) table
of random numbers, agreed in size with the Egyptian and Australian teeth more or less
closely than did the fifty-five teeth of Proconsul. The random sample of chimpanzee teeth
was so constructed as to contain the same numbers of different types of teeth as did the
Proconsul series. Similar tests were made with series of twenty-one and ten teeth of both the
orang-outang and gorilla, each taken at random to correspond with the twenty-one teeth
of Plesianthropus and the ten teeth of Paranthropus. The results are set out in table 14. The
dimensions of the random series of chimpanzee teeth resemble those of man more closely
than do the Proconsul teeth. The orang teeth resemble those of man more closely than do
those of Plesianthropus or Paranthropus, while those of the gorilla agree to an equal extent.

A brief reference was made in the introduction to this paper to the fact that the original
claims made about the character of the limb bones of the Australopithecinae by Broom
(Broom & Schepers 1946) and Le Gros Clark (19474, 6) have not been corroborated by
more recent studies. Thus Straus (1948) has concluded from a biometrical and statistical
analysis that the distal end of a humerus attributed by Broom to Paranthropus, and which
both he (Broom & Schepers 1946) and Le Gros Clark (1947a, 5) have claimed to be

essentially human in form, is *...no more hominid than it is anthropoid’. Furthermore,
Kern & Straus (1949), by a similar metrical analysis, have shown that the distal end of
a femur of Plesianthropus, which Broom (1946) and Le Gros Clark (19474, 6) have again
