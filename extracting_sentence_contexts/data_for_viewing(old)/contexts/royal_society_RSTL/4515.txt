764 MR. BRODIE ON THE CONDITION OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS

materials, as that the laws of motion should be different in different bodies. TI there-
fore considered attentively what we really knew of the laws of chemical change in
these bodies. Examples occurred to me, both of the chemical division and che-
mical synthesis of the elements, by which various phenomena hitherto obscure might
be explained. The experiments of the first class prove that a division of the elemental
bodies which is known to occur in certain cases of chemical change, is truly a che-
mical and not simply a mechanical division of these substances. This is shown by
the fact that the particles of the element thus separated show the peculiar combining
properties of * nascent bodies.” Tt is not necessary to my argument that the precise
view which I have given of the nature of this © nascent state ” should be admitted ;
provided only it be allowed, that these properties depend upon the fact that the par-
ticle is issuing from a state of combination, which is generally allowed.

1. No theory of chemical change has given rise to more discussion among chemists,
than the usual mode of the formation of sulphuric acid by the mutual action of snl-
phurous acid, nitric oxide, air and water. On this question there are some six re-
cognized theories. The problem is simply this : Why, when the oxygen is made a part
of this system of particles, does it possess oxidizing properties which otherwise it has
not? On the view I have stated the cause is plain. When nitric oxide acts chemi-
cally upon oxygen, the gas is thrown into a polar condition ; the result of which is
to give to other particles of the mass a combining power, in a direction the reverse
of that in which the oxygen combines with the nitric oxide; the change being in all
respects analogous to the decomposition of water by the joint action of nitric oxide
