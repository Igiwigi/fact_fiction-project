If we compare the Bovey flora with that of the Eocene beds of the Isle of Wight, we
find certainly some points of connexion, but, on the whole, an esentially different,
character, As connecting points, we may observe that one species (viz. Laurus primi-
genia, Ung.) is common to Alum Bay and Boyey, and, moreover, that the genera Quercus,
Ficus, Dryandroides, Daphnogene, and Sequoia appear in both places, although differing
in species. The fact of only one species being found in common at 0 short a distance
— that in the Eocene formations of the Isle of Wight the highly characteristic Cinnamon
and Lastrzas are wanting—above all, the fact that Bovey has many more species in
common with the more remote Miocene formations of the Continent than it has with
Alum Bay and Bournemouth, satisfies us that it belongs to a different horizon ®. In this summary we have noticed only the species already known. Among the new
species, however, of which I have described twenty-six, seyeral interesting forms are
found.
