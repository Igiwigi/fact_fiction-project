Moreover, it
may be added that the food supply theory fails to explain adequately the character of the
distribution of resin canals resulting from wounding. When a tree trunk produces resin
canals as a result of wounding, they centre not only in the region above the wound, but
also directly below it. In fact, there is no indication of a bifurcated arrangement below
the wound, as would be expected if the downward current of food were responsible for
their occurrence. In wounding of the root a similar condition obtains. These are
significant facts, indicating the existence of a stimulus acting apart altogether from
increased food supply.
