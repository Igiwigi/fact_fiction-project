If the Euglene are in a dense mass, they may assume all possible positions
in falling, but this is due to their being entangled with one another; this is
especially the case when they have been kept for a long time in the fixing fluid. When precautions are taken to prevent overcrowding and entanglement, if is rare
to find an individual which falls with its anterior end downwards. The orientation
is, in fact, precisely similar to that observed in the downward moving streams of the
living cells during aggregation, and is in opposition to their normal direction of
movement. We thus see that the conditions for a purely mechanical explanation
of the downward movement are fulfilled, and that an appeal to geotaxis is
unnecessary. The following experiment supports this conclusion.
