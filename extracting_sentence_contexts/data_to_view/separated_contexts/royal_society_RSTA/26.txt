The literature discussed above estimates the number of clusters via the marginal posterior on
the number of non-empty components. Alternatively, the full clustering solution can be estimated,
without conditioning on the number of clusters, thus also implicitly providing an estimate of this
number. In fact, Rajkowski [157] demonstrates that the MAP clustering has desirable asymptotic
properties in the simple example of Miller & Harrison [145], in stark contrast to the severe
inconsistency of the marginal posterior on the number of clusters. To estimate the clustering
solution, various ad hoc methods have been proposed [158-161]. Instead, we focus on a decision-
theoretic approach, obtaining the optimal clustering by minimizing the posterior expectation of
a specified loss function measuring the discrepancy between the true and estimating clustering.
