which require more detailed explanation than just the existence of a stationary value of
group velocity giving a maximum amplitude, in particular, the long trains of regular waves
observed to follow the main disturbance.


IN AN ELASTIC MEDIUM WITHA SINGLE SURFACE LAYER 215

Atleast part of the explanation is to be sought in the diffraction effect due to the curvature
of the wave fronts of which the simple ray theory does not take account.

Lamb (1904) first considered the generation of a disturbance in a semi-infinite medium
by the application of a vertical or horizontal impulse along a line in the surface. After
intricate analysis he showed that there should in fact be felt, in succession, just a P-pulse,
an S-pulse and a Rayleigh pulse, the two former abrupt like the initial pulse and the latter
a ‘blunt pulse’ beginning slowly, rising to a maximum and dying away. Lamb indicated
the procedure when the source lay below the surface and the problem was first attacked
by Nakano (1925). His methods were somewhat laborious, and there was a disturbing
inconsistency between the results obtained for an initial harmonic vibration and general-
ization to a pulse; but it seemed probable that in addition to the P-, S- and Rayleigh pulses
should be felt, for initial P- and S-pulses respectively, what he termed a ‘surface S-pulse’
and a ‘surface P-pulse’.

Jeffreys (19262) considered the disturbance due to a spherical explosion in the upper of
two superposed layers. He simplified the problem by neglecting rigidity; by using the
Bromwich expansion method (Bromwich 1916) he was able to resolve the disturbance into
