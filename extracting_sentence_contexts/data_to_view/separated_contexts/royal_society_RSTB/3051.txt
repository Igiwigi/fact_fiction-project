In Gmelina hystrix (fig. 9) sections of the small outgrowths mentioned above
(see p. 236) show that they also consist chiefly of epidermal cells which have become
enlarged, with little or no cell division. No oil or starch was observed in the enlarged cells. This fact seems to indicate
that the disturbance of the normal metabolism caused by the formation of these
small intumescences was only slight, but it is possible that, under other conditions,
the outgrowths might become larger and their contents different. In the formation
of most intumescences the mesophyll plays the chief part. Eucalyptus.â€”In this genus either one or both sides of a leaf were affected, and the
