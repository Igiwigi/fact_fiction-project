CAYLEY'S SECOND MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 103

or writing —«, instead of B,, the number in question is
1 1 1
aa( a+ 1)(4,+2) (4\+3) +3» (4+ 1) Þ+ 3ue(w+ 1). The integrals of the degrees 1 and 3 give rise to 4,z, integrals of the degree 4; and if
all the composite integrals obtained as above were asyzygetic, we should have

A,— aa (6+ 1 )(@+2) (4, +3) _—— +1 Je—Jay(a+ 1)—%a,%,

7.e. 4, as the number of irreducible integrals of the degree 4; but if there exist any
further syzygies between the composite integrals, then «, will be the number of the
irreducible integrals of the degree 4 less the number of such further syzygies, and the
like reasoning is in all cases applicable.

27. It may be remarked, that for any given partial differential equation, or 8ystem
of such equations, there will be always a finite number » such that given y inde-
pendent integrals every other integral is a function (in general an irrational function
only expressible as the root of an equation) of the y independent integrals; and if to
these integrals we join a single other integral not. a rational function of the » integrals,
it is easy to see that every other integral will be a rational function of the »+1 inte-
grals; but every such other integral will not in general be a rational and integral
function of the »+1 integrals ; and there isnot in general any finite number whatever
of integrals, such that every other integral is a rational and integral function of these
integrals, 7. e. the number of irreducible integrals is in general infinite; and it would
seem that this is in fact the case in the theory of covariants.

28. In the case of the covariants, or the invariants of a binary quantic, A, is given
(this will appear in the seque]) as the coefficient of a” in the development, in ascend-

ing powers of x, of a rational fraction = where fx is of the form

(1=2)*(1—a**,,(1—a*)*%,

and the degree of gz is less than that of fr. We have therefore
1+Ar+Ag?+ =
and consequently gx=(1—a)*-*(1—a%*%,,(1—a*)%-*%#(1—a#*1)-%+1,,,

Now every rational factor of a binomial 1—a” is the irreducible factor of 1—«a",
where m' is equal to or a submultiple of m.
