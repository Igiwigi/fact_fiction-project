which is stable if o € R and unstable if o has a non-vanishing imaginary part. For given values
of the homogeneous terms Raa, Rp, and Rec, this may be determined by computing a discriminant
B—A?/4 with

A A?
A= —(qh — 7) and B= —agyorg, + 7 (Cab + Otte) + Bir, Bac — CC (3.11)

To further investigate the presence of possibly unstable modes requires the specification of initial
conditions for the homogeneous amplitudes (or spectral action densities) Raa, Rpp and Rec. The
specification of the three waves is performed by writing, with no loss of generality, k, = (1,0)
and k, = (1+ p,q) for some p,q. Consequently, to satisfy 2k, = ky + k, requires k, = (1 — p, —4).
The steepness ¢; of the three waves k;,i € {a,b,c} is the second defining parameter, which is related
to the amplitude a; by a;|k;| = ¢;. In fact, for simplicity, ec is taken to be zero throughout. The two
initially present ‘mother waves’ k, and k; will be shown to be unstable to the effects of small
inhomogeneities, and thereby give rise to the growth of the daughter wave k,. A deterministic
counterpart to this situation was recently explored experimentally by Bonnefoy et al. [17].
The initial complex amplitudes are assumed Gaussian, and written as

ba(O) = [bal e!* + [al e'? (3.12)

and
by(0) = |bp| el + |upl el, (3.13)

where the magnitudes |ba|, |bp|, |4a| and |p| are Rayleigh distributed, the phases ¢,,¢, and ¢ are
uniformly distributed over [0, 277), and || « |bil.
