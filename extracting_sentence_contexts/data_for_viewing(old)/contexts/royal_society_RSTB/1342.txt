Tn reviewing the previous work on the life-history aud nuclei of the Foraminifera,
T have confined myself to a rather limited range of forms. I have done so because it
‘ peared best to select the evidence of such forms as are most obviously related to
a which I had to describe.

Scuaupixn has recently published (31) a preliminary account of his researches
into the reproduction and mode of increase of the nuclei in the Foraminifera. This I
did not see until after my paper was written. Many of the observations appear to

Ge of the highest interest, but no mention is made of the important fact of the
gpxistence of dimorphism. Polystomella crispa (Luxn.) is described as usually having
Fe or four nuclei, but is said to become many-nucleated during reproduction ; a form
a reproduction is also described in which the whole of the protoplasm leaves the shell
Bod divides up into numbers of young individuals which assume the characteristic
Fhape of the species. ScHAUDINN has, however, apparently failed to recognise what
4 undoubtedly the fact, that in this species one in every thirty to forty individuals is
Shicrospheric and possesses nuclei of a quite different character from that of the
Bregalospheri ic form.

“Breparatory to reproduction, ScHAUDINN describes a breaking up of the nucleus into
ae which are dispersed through the protoplasm; in this general result, my
