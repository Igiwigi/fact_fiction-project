we have ordinarily observed in ourselves at sea-level.

On July 11, six hours after reaching the summit, the pulse rates of all of us were
somewhat accelerated. The acceleration was, however, surprisingly slight—much less

than that usually recorded by previous observers. It is to be remembered that we,
unlike most investigators at great altitudes, had not been subjected to any physical
exertion. The importance of this condition is shown by the fact that in all of us
throughout our stay on the Peak any considerable physical exertion induced an
acceleration of the pulse much greater than would have occurred at sea-level. Thus
four days after arrival we found that two minutes’ rapid walking up the railway (grade
1 in 4) brouhgt the pulse of HanpAne to 132 per minute, that of HeNpERsoN to
144, and that of Scunerper to 156. This effect appeared most markedly in new-
comers and especially in those inclined to be mountain-sick. After the first few days
we were all able to walk about at ordinary gaits on such level space as the summit
afforded with no more subjective indications of altered heart rate or force than at sea-
level. On the other hand, in the case of FULLER, whose normal resting pulse rate in
Colorado Springs is 69, two observations when he was feeling unwell on the Peak
showed rates of 86 and 96, and merely strolling about on the level terrace in front of
the Summit House raised the rate to 115 and 120,
