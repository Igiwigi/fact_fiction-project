Of the grafts which develop no nerVous tissue, some, like 428, become more
or less incorporated into the host and are probably not to be expected to induce, while
the others are mostly derived from the posterior third of the streak. As Wertzet has
shown, the posterior third of the streak probably takes little part in the formation
of the axial structures of the embryo, but becomes part of the side plate mesoderm,
and in that case, perhaps, it is reasonable to suppose that grafts derived from this region
are unlikely to induce. In point of fact, grafts of this kind, such as 610a froma posterior
third, form merely masses of mesodermal or indifferent tissue above which the ectoderm
is slightly thickened, but shows no other sign of forming a neural plate. In order to
obtain grafts containing no neural tissue, which yet succeed in inducing, the only chance
appears to be to graft a piece of streak which does not reach sufficiently anteriorly to
include medullary material, but which is sufficiently anterior to include axial mesoderm,
The boundaries of the presumptive tissue-areas are not known exactly enough for this
to be done at will, but we have, perhaps, such cases in 570, 596A, the first of these
being derived from a: middle third. and: the last from a posterior half: In-these cases,

the graft tissues consist of a large mass of mesoderm. Above this the host ectoderm
is thickened to a greater extent than in cases like 610a, and has also formed a groove,
so that the general appearance is as though a primitive streak or very early neural
plate had been induced.
