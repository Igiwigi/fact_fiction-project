The
eberian theory has been subjected to destructive criticism by von Hetmnonrz, on
the ground that it implies the possibility of a perpetual motion; the mode of genesis
the present theory obviates such a criticism. The features of the Weberian theory
above mentioned were characterized by Maxwett as “eminently successful”
ee eetise,” § 856), although this commendation is afterwards limited by the assertion
that these features are necessarily connected by the principle of energy. It is now,
Raver, recognized that this principle cannot by itself furnish more than one relation
— the various quantities that enter into the problem of electrodynamic induc-
ion, so that the fact that any theory, not otherwise discredited, accounts for the two
‘types of forcive in the electric field, ought to weigh strongly in its favour. The range
of a theory of moving electrons of the present type, with its underlying ether, is of
Gourse much wider than that covered by Wrper. © When the mechanical forcive is exerted only on the discrete electrons contained in
‘the element of volume, it clearly cannot involve directly in its constitution an equili-
Bbrating internal stress, such as we found must be included if we take the current
eelement as a connected physical entity; it is for this reason that Wuprr’s theory,
‘Sthough in other respects different from the present one, agrees with it in giving the
SA mpipe-MaXxwWELL ponderomotive force, involving the ¢we current however, not the
‘Stotal current as in Maxwext’s formula.
