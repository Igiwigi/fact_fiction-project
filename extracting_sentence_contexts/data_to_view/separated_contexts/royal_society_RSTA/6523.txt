I would also give little credence to current popular
theories (such as inflationary cosmology) that attempt to account for the structure
of the early universe, since the ultimate unknown appears to be this same missing
‘quantum gravity’ theory. It is quantum gravity, in some form, that ultimately gov-
erns the very uniform structure of the Big Bang space-time singularity, but it also
must govern the very non-uniform singularities in black holes. Evidence coming from
the existence of the second law of thermodynamics, and other observational facts,
indeed points to a gross time-asymmetry in the appropriate union between general
relativity and quantum mechanics. This, again, is not a feature of any of the exist-
ing proposals for that union, and this provides an additional reason for my personal
scepticism. These remarks may seem like comments of despair; but I prefer to see things in
a more optimistic light.
