other, which was supported on an adjustable table. The instrument was used for determining the electro-
chemical equivalent of water.

In 1864 JouLE|| made a current weigher having three circular flat coils wound with copper strip, one
being suspended from a balance, so that its mean plane, which was horizontal, was midway between those
of the other two fixed coils. This instrument had the correction to its principal constant determined by
comparison with a standard tangent galvanometer, and was employed in JouLx’s electrical determination
of the mechanical equivalent of heat. Its object was to enable a constant current to be maintained through
the calorimeter, independent of variations in the earth’s magnetic field.

Latimer CLaRK,{i in determining the E.M.F. of his standard cell in 1872, used a bifilar electro-
dynamometer with circular fixed and moving coils, each arranged in the Helmholtz fashion. The fixed
coils were of large size relative to the suspended ones, a fact which considerably simplified the calculation
of the torque per unit current. ‘The instrument had been constructed for the Electrical Standards
