These fluctuations were usually observed
when the cloud was not producing lightning discharges and seemed on several
occasions to be characteristic of an earlier stage in the development of the cloud. They
were usually observed when the cloud was comparatively distant and could not
therefore be explained by the passage overhead of small charged clouds. It would
seem, in fact, that they were due to corresponding fluctuations in the electric moment
of the cloud. This implies that the electric moment can fluctuate with a quasi-period
of a few seconds and with an amplitude comparable with the whole value of the
electric moment. The effect may conceivably be due to some form of turbulent motion
in the cloud.
