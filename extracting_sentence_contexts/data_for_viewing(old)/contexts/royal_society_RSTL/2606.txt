THE LAND IN CERTAIN PARTS OF SWEDEN, 11

on the high road. The deposit is elevated only a few yards above Lake Macler,
and is therefore about the same above the Baltic; but the formation extends to
greater heights in this and adjoining low lands, as do associated beds of gravel and
sand, in which I could not detect any fossils.

After viewing these geological phenomena, I was well inclined to receive favour-
ably any probable evidence brought forward to prove that the land has been rising
in recent times in the neighbourhood of Stockholm ; but I must confess that, on
close investigation, I was disappointed in finding that several of the proofs relied
on by some writers were very equivocal. Among other facts, it has been noticed
that the level of Lake Maeler has been lowered in very modern times; and it is clear
that the waters of this lake would appear to fall, together with the sea, if there be a
general rise of the land, since Lake Maeler joins an arm, or fiord, of the Gulf of Both-
nia at Stockholm, the salt and fresh water meeting in the middle of the city. The lake
is generally three feet higher than the sea ; but the line of separation is not constant,
and when the Baltic rises very high, its waters flow for s0me miles into the lake. In
that part of the town called the Rid-
darholmen, immediately above where
the waters of the lake meet the sea,
(se Map, fig. 6.,) s0me of the buildings
have of late years become insecure,
because the level of Lake Maeler has
