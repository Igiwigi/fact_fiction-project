When I changed the convex lens for a plano-concave glass
of the same focus, appearances were $till the same; and when
by a critical application of a plain glass I produced coloured
streaks from the base of the prism, the interposition of either
the convex or concave glass was equally immaterial. A
scattering glass applied to the incident ray, had no other effect
than to diminish the brightness of the bow.


the Cause of coloured concentric Rings. 281

The same experiment may be repeated with the red bow ;
but as here the first surface is essential to the formation of the
bow, the plain side of the convex lens or concave glass, when
placed against the prism, as before, will produce streaks ;
neither the bow, nor its streaks however will be in: the least
affected by the convexity or concavity of the outward surface

a scattering glass will have no effect to disturb the bow or its
