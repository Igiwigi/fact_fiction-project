The other leaf-traces, which had not begun to pass
out, must be represented by some, at least, of the medullary strands, perhaps by all
except the most deeply seated. No rezular fusions, comparable to those between the
medullary and circum-medullary strands of Archwopitys, have been observed in Pitys. We cannot in fact, trace anything like a complete homology between the primary
xylem-strands of the two genera, for in Archawopitys there appears to be a sharp
distinction between circum-medullary leaf-traces and accessory strands imbedded in
the pith, while in Pitys no differentiation is evident. The difficulty is probably due
to the imperfection of our knowledge in each case ; the presence and similar structure
of the primary strands in the pith of the two genera is sufficient, as it seems, to
establish a relationship between them. The secondary wood does not afford much material for close comparison.
