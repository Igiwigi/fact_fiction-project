multiple-choice responses offers new possibilities.

In some cases, however, the use of all possible dichotomizations is not justifiable. Notably,
if the values of an rv are linearly ordered, x1 <x2 <--- ,xy, it may be natural to only allow
dichotomizations f with f@ containing several successive values, {xj,X)41,---,XL}, for some
1,Leé{1,...,N}. An even stronger restriction would be to only allow ‘cuts’, with fOM=
{Xp X1p1/-++/XN} OF {X1,X2,.--, X11}.

Stronger restrictions on possible dichotomizations translate into stronger restrictions on the pairs : 3
Ry Re whose canonical representation is contextual. This fact is especially important if one 12
considers expanding CbD beyond categorical rvs. Thus, it is easy to see that if one considers mea)
all possible dichotomizations of two conteNt-sharing rvs with continuous densities on the set of :
real numbers, then the system will be contextual whenever the two distributions are not identical. a]
Let the densities of these rvs be f(x) and g(x) shown in the graphic above. If the set of all splits DNS
of these rvs forms a non-contextual system, then any discretization of these rvs should satisfy aon
corollary 4.5 to theorem 4.4. That is, for any k > 2 and any partition Hj,...,H, of the set of reals [8
into intervals, we should have either .

Sig, f(x) dx < Su, g(x) dx for no more than one of i=1,...,k
or (5.1)
Si, Fe) dx > Su, g(x) dx for no more than one of i=1,...,k.
