It has been
already suggested, whether the increased growth of the grasses here, in the mixed
herbage, is due to similar conditions being induced by the increased growth of the
Leguminosme, now in association, instead of separately in alternation, with them ;
that is, whether it be due to a residue of combined nitrogen left after the growth of
the Jeguminous plants in such condition of combination and distribution as to be now
available for the associated gramineous ones, the subsequent growth of which is
thereby enhanced. Another explanation obviously may be, that under the influence
of the mixed mineral manure, including potass, the richer nitrogenous accumulations
of the surface oil of the grassland itself, yield up their stores in a condition in which
the Gramineree as well as the Leguminose of the mixed herbage can take them up. Against this supposition is the fact, that such a potass manure will increase the growth
of Leguminosz in the poorer in nitrogen ordinary arable land, whilsb it will not, in
any marked degree, increase the growth of the Graminez on 8uch arable land, If,
therefore, the result be due to the direct liberation, in an available form, of nitrogen
from the resources of the soil itself, under the influence of the mineral manure, it
would seem that it must be provided in different conditions of combination for these
two very distinch descriptions of herbage, and that a supply in the condition required
by the Graminewz is in a very mach greater degree available from the richer in nitrogen
pasture, than from the poorer in nitrogen arable, surface soil. 5. Superphasphate of lime, alone ; Plot 4-1. The experiment with superphosphate of lime alone did nob commence until the
fourth year ; sawdust alone, but without effect, having been applied in each of the
first three years.
