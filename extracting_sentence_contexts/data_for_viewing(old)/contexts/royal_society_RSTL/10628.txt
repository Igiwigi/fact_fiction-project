which the area is wrapped. This is, of course, not 80 convenient, and its Possibility
is chiefly interesting from a theoretical point of view.

The satisfactory working of the firs model proved that the principle of action was
practicable, and some of the mos important results were at once evident ; one of
these being the formation of a chain of guch mechanisms in which the loss from
friction would be inappreciable ; another being the application of a rapidly moving
screw with clock-work for s8uch instruments as speed indicators. Moreover, the
compound arrangement might be of very compact form. There was one objection
which, though of no importance in most applications for purposes of integration, was
a serious one for certain applications of the converse process. This was the fact that
the movable centres, nobwithstanding the great range of velocity ratio, could neyer
take such a position as to give the limiting values in either direction. This is shown
at once by fig. 12, where it is seen that to do this, that is, for a to become 0? or 90*
the movable centres would have to come into contact with the other rollers A A‚Äù or
B B'. It mus not be overlooked that although the roller centres are nominally in
contact at a point, yet that really the sphere, in turning, twists upon the movable
centres at its equator, while motion of the movable frame causes the supporting rollers
to twist upon the sphere at its poles. The result is that a 8mooth, hard, and conse-
quently expensive sphere is required, which in the integrating machine shown in
figs. 11 and 12 is made of ivory. It should be noted that even if slight wear takes
place ab the centres it is distributed over the whole spherical surface, for directly the
frame moves round, the former centre becomes a point which, by a sorb of precessional
