I was unable to take pressure after 1'0 millim., as the McLeop measuring
apparatus does not give trustworthy indications when aqueous vapour is present. As $00n as the pressure in the measuring tube rises above the tension of aqueous
vapour, water condenses in it, and measurements can no longer be taken. [

These results plotted as a diagram give the curve shown in diagram A, marked
« Moist Air.”

Up to a pressure of about 350 millims. the presencg of aqueous vapour has little or
no influence on the viscosity of air. The two curves are in fact snperimposed. At
this point, however, divergence commences, and the curve rapidly bends over, the
log. dec. falling from 00903 to 00500 between 50 and 7 millims. pressxure. Here
it joins the hydrogen curve, and between 7 millims. and 1 millim. they appear to be
identical.
