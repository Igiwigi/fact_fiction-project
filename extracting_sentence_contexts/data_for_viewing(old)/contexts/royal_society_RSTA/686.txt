the 2015 UK eclipse’.

]. Introduction

On 20 March 2015, a partial solar eclipse was observed throughout the United Kingdom (UK).
The magnitude of the partial eclipse varied across the UK, from approximately 85% in southern
regions, up to approximately 95% in the north. Over the UK, the times of first contact, eclipse

maximum and fourth contact were approximately 0830 UT, 0930 UT and 1040 UT, respectively :2
(throughout this article all times are in UT). Atmospheric observations during prior eclipses : =
have demonstrated that the prevailing meteorology can be perturbed by the rapid changes in 3
insolation associated with the propagation of the eclipse penumbra through the atmosphere [1]. : =
In fact, it is known that eclipses significantly affect each layer of the Earth’s atmosphere, from DS
the troposphere to the ionosphere, and a large volume of research has been published on this : S
subject, as reviewed elsewhere in this issue by Aplin et al. [2]. Focusing on eclipse-driven 3
meteorological changes, the two most pronounced and readily understood effects are the large : =)
decrease in short-wave solar radiation, which can be almost 100%! for total eclipses [3], and : Ss
a corresponding decrease in air temperature, which can be several kelvin. However, there are is

also more subtle and complex features in the meteorological response. For example, studies have
reported both temporary decreases in the wind speed and anticlockwise rotations in the wind
direction [1,4,5]. The dynamical processes driving the observed changes in the wind field have
yet to be fully understood and continue to be investigated; see paper by Gray & Harrison in this
issue [6]. The infrequent and transient nature of eclipses makes it challenging to obtain sufficient
observations to isolate the eclipse-induced changes from the natural evolution of the prevailing
