During
the night, the cell budded off, on the 15th separated, and at 9 a.m. on the 16th, a new
one was being formed near its point of origin (fig. 10, d) ; to this a third was added by
6 p.m. (e), and considerable progress was made during the ensuing night, owing,
probably, to the slight rise of temperature which occurred in the laboratory. In fact,
by 10 a.m. on the 17th, quite a colony of budding cells was formed (/), and this
continued up to 4 pm. (g). By this time, however, a change was noticed in
the behaviour of some of the cells, which were beginning to elongate. On the
morning of the 18th, the temperature being still 15Â° C. as on the preceding day,
the cells had put out long hypha-like arms, some of which produced terminal cells,
like budding conidia, as shown in fig.
