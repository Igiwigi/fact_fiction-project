activity had developed, and a mild increase in tone was observed following stimulation of
the infundibular stem and injection of pitocin (500 mU). On the seventeenth day, rhythmic
activity had increased and a well-marked contraction, tending towards a tetanus, followed
stimulation and the injection of pitocin (500 mU). It would seem that this animal, in
oestrus at the time of the vaginal transplantation, was rendered anoestrous by the trauma
of the operation and then slowly came on heat during the subsequent 2 or 3 weeks.

A similar sequence of events has been observed in rabbit 35 and in two of the animals
in group B.

(ii) The response of the oestrous uterus. The response of the oestrous uterus to stimulations
of the neurohypophysis has been observed many times (107) in the animals in group C.
Before describing the response in detail, it is worth mentioning the facts that (a) the response
varied slightly from animal to animal, but in any one animal was similar to that following
injection of posterior lobe extracts, (b) the response could be graded by varying the intensity
of the stimulus (i.e. by varying the 1.c.p.), (c) a critical 1.c.p. could be found, representing

a threshold stimulus (it is to be noted that the critical 1.c.p. to elicit the oxytocic effect was
slightly less than that for the anti-diuretic effect) and (d) the maximum uterine responses
to stimulation of the neurohypophysis were approximately equal to those following intra-
venous injection of 500 mU pitocin.
