up in one gramme of coal is therefore more than ten times as great as that stored up
in 1 gramme of powder.

The powder, it is true, contains all the oxygen necessary for its own combustion, while
the coal draws nearly 3 grammes of oxygen from the air, Even allowing, however,
for this, there is a considerable inferiority in the work done by gunpowder, which is
doubtless in part due to the fact that the coal finds its oxygen already in the form of
gas, while a considerable amount of work is expended by the gunpowder in placing its
oxygen in a similar condition.

In an economic point of view also the oxygen stored up in the gunpowder is of no im-
portance, as that consumed by coal costs nothing, while the oxygen in the powder is in a
most expensive form. The fact is perhaps worth noting as demonstrating the impracticabi-
lity of making economic engines deriving their motive power from the force of gunpowder.

Z., SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

It only now remains to summarize the principal results at which we have arrived in
the course of our rescarches («) when gunpowder is fired in a space entirely confined;
(3) when it is suffered to expand in the bore of a gun.

(a) The results when powder is fired in a close space are as follow, and for convenience
are computed upon 1 gramme of powder occupying a volume of 1 cub. centim. —

1. On explosion, the products of combustion consist of about 57 per cent. by weight
