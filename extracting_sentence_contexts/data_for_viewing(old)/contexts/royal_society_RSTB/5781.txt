increase in the angle between the next two primordia when I, is isolated than when P, is
isolated. For when I, is isolated, the distances of the next two primordia from the old
growing-point are less, since they are younger, and consequently an equal absolute
shift of the growing-point towards the gap between them must cause a greater increase
in their divergence angle.

It was found, however, that the increase in the divergence angle of the next two
primordia was not entirely accounted for as the direct result of the shift of the growing-

point towards them. It was partly due to the fact that the centre of the second
primordium after the isolated primordium arose not in its normal position, but closer
to the wound, whereas the centre of the first primordium retained its normal position.
This change in the position of the second primordium could not indeed be detected by
measurements of divergence angles, since the original position of the growing-point was
not known and attempts to locate it by reference to the older leaves proved unsuccessful.
But finally a method was adopted of detecting—though not of measuring—changes in
the position of the next two primordia after the isolated primordium, by observing their
relation to the older leaves with which they
made contact. For in transverse sections
of normal buds the central vascular strand
of each leaf is seen to lie very close to one of
the main lateral strands of the older of the
