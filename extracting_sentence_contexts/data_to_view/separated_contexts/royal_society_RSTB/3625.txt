The ratio of root to shoot is
very close in the two sets. Again, wheat and barley grown in the same solution yield
weights agreeing within the range of error of such experiments. These facts alone
would dismiss the hypothesis that the wheat soils contain any soluble toxin injurious
to wheat but not to barley, and vice versd, notwithstanding the 60 yearsâ€™ repeated
growth of these crops on the same soils. In Series Il the demonstration was pushed
a stage further by including in the comparison an artificial culture solution made from
pure salts and containing phosphoric acid and potash in the same proportions as the
solutions from the completely manured plots. Another set of the soil solutions was
boiled before use, since boiling had been reputed to destroy the toxin and would at
any rate kill off any bacteria that might be factors in the result.
