Alternatively, as suggested by Grojean [9], the
Higgs boson may be a manifestation of some novel strong interactions that could have interesting
implications for future experiments on the Higgs boson as well as other possible new particles. The possible connections between the Higgs boson and cosmology are reviewed in the paper by
Shaposhnikov [10]. Puzzling aspects of conventional Big Bang cosmology include its size and
the fact that Euclidean geometry is so successful. One possible way to resolve these puzzles may
be via an epoch of cosmological inflation, perhaps driven by energy in ‘empty’ space related to
the Higgs, a suggestion that is now being challenged by measurements of the cosmic microwave
background radiation. Many of the outstanding issues posed by the discovery of the Higgs boson will be addressed
during future runs of the LHC accelerator, which will require substantial upgrades of the
experiments, as reviewed in the paper by Wells [11].
