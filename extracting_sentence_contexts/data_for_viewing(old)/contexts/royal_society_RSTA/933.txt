a sufficient condition for predictability is that the observations are within 1 s.d. of the MMEM.
However, here we find that even the MMEM does not exhibit the robust observational features
of white noise characteristics on annual-biannual time scales or the characteristic decadal time
scales. Figure 4 compares the fluctuation functions for the EIJE from the satellite observations
(blue) to the MMEM. The longest crossover time scale present in the MMEM data is 1.8 years and
that from the observations is 8.6 years. Therefore, simply summing different models to produce
the MMEM does not provide the observed statistical structure of the ice pack.

A central role of observations is to produce robust statistical metrics that can serve as a
target for modelling. Whereas, even with incorrect physics, it is possible to match features of the
observations, capturing the appropriate statistical properties should provide important litmus
tests for models. Our method is agnostic with regard to the number of crossover time scales, and
hence associated processes, that may be present in the system. Therefore, we hope that the fact
that we capture both the shortest and longest observed processes in the ice pack will provide a
useful and robust test bed for modelling studies.
