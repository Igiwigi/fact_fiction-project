'= is two seconds, for this is exactly the same time required for replacing the needle
£ which had been removed from its position by the first contraction. The numbers
© which follow are the degrees of the division of the dial of the apparatus. It is un-
= necessary for me to give all the numbers resulting from my experiments ; it will be
A sufficient to cite some of them in order to show the course of the phenomena. The
following experiment proves the weakening of the excitability of the nerve owing to
the passage of the direct current. Kach passage of the current was prolonged for
8ixty 8econds, and the following numbers give the measure of the contraction ob-
tained each time the circuit was closed. These numbers are 16, 12, 10, 8, 4, 2, 2, 1.
The inverse current was next tried on the other limb. On prolonging the passage of
the current for two seconds I obtained a contraction of 10?. TI left the circuit closed
for sixty minutes, and still the contraction was 7 on opening the circuit. Thus far
these numbers merely show the principal fact upon which I have insisted s0 strongly,

* Both at the commencement of the current and on its ceasing.

which is, the very different rate of reduction of the excitability observable in two nerves,
one of which is exposed to the passage of the direct, the other to that of the inverse
current.

It was very important to compare the excitability of a nerve subjected to the pas-
