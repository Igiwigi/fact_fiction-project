By contrast, the lowest concentration allowing the detection of
the graphite G-band and shungite G- and D-bands was 1g kg~! (figure 7b,c).

4. Discussion

This study follows our earlier results, where halite from the hyperarid zone of the Atacama Desert
was studied using an identical analytical approach [65]. The fact that 785nm excitation used with the miniaturized Raman system is good for the
detection of evaporitic minerals, but not favourable for detection of carotenoids compared with
532 nm system confirms our previous experience [65,76]. Higher levels of fluorescence background observed sometimes during the analysis of powders
compared with hard rocks were noted. We interpret this observation as a possible result of
dispersion of the fluorescent agent, which is not normally associated with the cells in the
powdered mixture.
