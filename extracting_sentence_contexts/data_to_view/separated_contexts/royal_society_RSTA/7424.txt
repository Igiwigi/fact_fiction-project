The
integral now extends only over a finite time interval but has a more involved spatial
dependence and is complicated by the existence (in the isotropic case) of two velocities of
wave propagation. Moreover, the problem is not simply one of translation of the loop; we
have to find its change of form as a function of time. It is perhaps not worth while pursuing
this problem until it is decided whether the motion of a dislocation is in fact governed by
inertia (Frank 1949) or by quasi-viscous forces (Leibfried 1950). REFERENCES
