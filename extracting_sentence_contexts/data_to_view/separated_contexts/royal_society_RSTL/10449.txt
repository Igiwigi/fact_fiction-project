Tn this case the region of the middle and
inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolutions was disorganised without any indications of
tactile anzsthesia. Some extension of the primary lesion occurred secondarily, but
whether any anzsthesia resulted was not observed. The fact of importance is that
the primary lesions were without discoverable effect, on tactile sensibility. In Experiment 26 also, though the lower temporo-sphenoical region was destroyed,

the hippocampal region only partially involved, there was only slight and transitory
pairment of tactile sensibility on the opposite side.
