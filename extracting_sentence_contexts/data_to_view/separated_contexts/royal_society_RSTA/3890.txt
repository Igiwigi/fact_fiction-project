If the mix of species in the oxic Black Sea pool includes the
minor amounts of carbonate and chloride complexes suggested by Landing & Lewis [65], the A
value between the oxidized pool of Zn and the sulfidic pool is +0.64%o. Thus, the pattern across
the redoxcline is consistent with a shift in Zn speciation to sulfide species, partitioning of the light
isotopes into these species, and their partial removal from the dissolved pool. Apart from the
fact that nothing more complex than a simple Rayleigh model is required by the data, there are
also reasons to suspect that, once Zn is sulfidized, back equilibration with the non-sulfidized pool
stops. Daskalakis & Helz [67] note that the Black Sea water column may be close to saturation
with respect to sphalerite (ZnS) at the redoxcline. On the other hand, the sulfidized species of Zn
may be less stable in solution against scavenging.
