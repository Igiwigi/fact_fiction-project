urethra; but my dissections show that the external fibres of the prostate (Plate IV.
figs. 30 & 32, w; Plate V. diagram 7, p) and the internal or submucous fibres
of the urethra (Plate IV. figs. 30 & 32, 7; Plate V. diagram 7, d") are altogether
independent of each other, and are separated by a wide interval—the interval being
occupied by the slightly oblique, oblique, and yery oblique fibres peculiar to the
prostate and urethra. The very oblique or circular fibres of the prostate (Plate IV.
figs. 24 & 27, 9) and urethra (m), as will be seen from this account, are likewise
separated by a considerable interval. The interval is widest at the base of the gland
(Plate IV. fig. 24, m, 0), where the sphincter is most fully developed, and at the apex
(fig. 27, m, 0). Towards the centre of the prostate the circular fibres (Plate IV.
figs. 25 & 26, 0) of the gland curve in an upward direction into the veromontanum
or caput gallinaginis (7), where they blend with the circular fibres of the urethra (m).
I draw attention to these facts because, as has been stated, TlopesonF, Ellisf, and
other investigators are of opinion that the circular fibres of the prostate are identical
with those of the bladder and urethra, which is contrary to my experience. The cir-
cular fibres of the prostate are for the most part not only widely removed from those of
