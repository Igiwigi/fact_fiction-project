Â¢ agrees more closely with No, 2 than with No. 1, since it ascribes an important
zZ part of the phenomenon to the variation in turgor of the guard cells. It will be
3 seen, in the sequel, that it differs in one important particular, since I do not
i believe that the movement in the guard cells can be explained by the direct
S effect of light or darkness, but rather that these changes act as stimuli.

The immediate cause of the variation of turgor either in guard cells or epidermis is
not known. Mont connected the turgor of the guard cells with the assimilative
function of their chloroplasts, and this view is still prevalent, though, as far as
I know, no reason has ever been given for the guard cells behaving differently to
other chlorophyllous tissues. Since the time of Mont our knowledge of the causes

which alter cell-turgor has been greatly increased.* We have cases in which the
production of osmotic material is regulated in a manner of which no direct or
nutritive explanation can be given. Knowledge of this sort may justify us in
expecting that the turgor of the guard cells will be found to be regulated indirectly
like other phenomena of irritability, but this does not permit us to pass over Mout's
theory. The idea is simple enough, #.e., that increased assimilation leads to increase
of osmotic material, and, therefore, to opening of the stoma, and, vice versd, darkness
