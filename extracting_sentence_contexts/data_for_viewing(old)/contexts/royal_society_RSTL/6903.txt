each other may be termed independent lines, as far as a surface of the third order is
capable of containing all of them ; the greatest number of such lines is four; that is to
8ay, mn whatever manner we may choose two, three, or four not, intersecting lines on the
surface, the system has always the same properties. Let two independent lines I. and
I. on the surface be given, and imagine any one of the five triangle-planes passing
through I. ; then II. must intersect one of the two other sides of this triangle; in other
words, this triangle affords a line cutting both I. and II., and a line cutting I. alone.
Henee it appears that there are five lines cutting both I. and IL. five lines cutting I.
only, five lines cutting II. only, and ten lines cutting neither I. nor IL

[The theory of the 27 lines depends on the expression of the equation of the surface
in the form P=Q=0, where P and Q are real or imaginary cubics breaking up into
linear factors; in fact, if the equation be 80 expressed, it is at once seen that each of the
planes P=0 meets each of the planes Q=0 in a line on the surface, 80 that the form
gives at once 9 out of the 27 lines. The three planes represented by the equation P=0
(or Q=0) are termed a Trihedral of the surface.]

Art. 2. PRoe. 1t is always possible to find a trihedral represented by a real quaternary
cubic.

The truth of this proposition is evident when all the 27 lines are real. But when
some of them are imaginary, these are conjugate by pairs. As the case when two con-
Jugate lines intersect one another is fitter for our purpose, we begin with the other case
when two conjugate lines do not intersect each other.
