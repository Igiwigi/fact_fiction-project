If we restrict ourselves to the main contribution to the crystal radius and its first correction, one
can obtain the following dimensional expressions for R(t) and V(t) from (2.18):

_ BeAr? m(1 — k)aACo
RO = Brat (1+ meee)
BoA2t (1 — aac 20)
=p, — Peet me — aato
and V(t) = Bad aA (1 + D ) ,

where A = T, — T(1,0) — mC(1,0) represents the system supercooling. If we formally put Cy = 0,
expressions (2.19) transform to the corresponding solutions for one-component systems [12]. Note
that the growth rate V(t) of crystals in binary melts is less than the rate of their growth in single-
component systems (m > 0, k < 1). An important feature of expressions (2.19) is the fact that they
do not depend on the radius R, of the equivalent sphere. Considering the intermediate stage of
crystal growth in a metastable liquid when all particles do not interact with their neighbouring
crystals, we note that T(1,0) and C(1,0) correspond to the mean temperature T) and concentration
C; of a metastable binary system.
