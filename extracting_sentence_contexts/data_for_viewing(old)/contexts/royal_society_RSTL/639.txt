in the same manner as carbonate of lime forms veins in secondary
rocks. All these substances have the appearance peculiar to
quartz, and show nothing that is at all analogous to that appear-
ance which s0 strongly characterises calcedony; the latter, also,
pos8esses a degree of hardness superior to that of any of the
others, Besides, quartz in a concrete state is often found acci-
dentally mixed with martial argill; a circumstance that, as is well
known, frequently happens to calcedony. Inthe former case,a true
Jasper is formed, which has a quartzose base, instead of having,
as in the latter case, a base of calcedony. The appearance of
these two kinds of jasper is 80 different, that the most inex-
perienced eye cannot fail to distinguigh them at first sight.
Many other facts might be added, in support of what I have
said. Calcedony, for example, is easily decomposed : there are
| few masses of this substance of any considerable size, few frag-
ments of flint, jasper, &c. which have lain for any length of
time upon the surface of the earth, that do not atford a demon-
stration of it. Most kinds of cacholong are nothing more than
the eff-ct of this decomposition, in a more or less advanced
state, which (as happens in the girasol, but in a less perfect and '
less striking manner) causes the stones in which it takes place,
to possess the property of becoming transparent in water.
Quartz, whether in the most perfectly crystallized state, or in
that in which its crystallization has been the most disturbed,
possesses nothing which can be compared with the above pro-
