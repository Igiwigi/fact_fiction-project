concerned in the production of the two classes of lines, but Hemsanecu hesitated to
adopt this view until other experiments had been made.

The series investigation not only points to the existence ot different emitting
systems, but, in the light of Bour’s theory, may possibly give a clue to the nature of
the difference. The appearance of 4N in the formule for series of enhanced lines
suggests that, as in the case of proto-helium, such series are produced during the
binding of an electron by each of the atoms from which two electrons have been
removed by the exciting source ; while are series lines are emitted during the re-forma-
tion of atoms from each of which only one electron has been removed. Although
the neutral atoms of different elements contain different numbers of electrons, the
approximate constancy of N for are series, according to Borr, is explained by the
fact that the force on an electron entering a system consisting of a positive nucleus
and a number of electrons one less than that required to render it neutral would not
be very different from the force in the case of the binding of an electron by a hydrogen
atom. A similar explanation would evidently account for the constancy of 4N in the
formule for series of enhanced lines. Variations from the simple series conditions

presented by hydrogen and proto-helium would be expected in consequence of the
presence of additional electrons, but these have not yet been worked out theoretically
by Dr. Borr.
