Due recognition of these differences, however, is made in the text. In the reconstruction of the five and a half day chick, fig. 8, Plate 4, it will be
seen that the mandibular and maxillary rami of the external carotid are essentially
the same as in the four and a half day stage, but that they point forwards instead
of downwards. This is correlated with the fact that at this time the mandibular
arches swing forwards and come to lie inside the maxilla. In a six and a half
day embryo, chondrification of the visceral skeleton has taken place, and the
relationship of the two rami of the external carotid to the “ hyoid apparatus ” can
readily be made out. The junction of maxillary and mandibular rami is medial
to the ceratobranchial, along the dorsal edge of which the mandibular ramus runs
forward for some distance.
