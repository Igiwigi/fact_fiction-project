And in some experiments made very carefully by my
brother Mr. Jonn Davy, on the decomposition of muriatic
acid gas, by heated tin and zinc, hydrogene equal to about half
its volume was disengaged, and metallic muriates, the same
as those produced by the combustion of tin and zinc in oxy-
muriatic gas, resulted. It is evident from this series of observations, that ScHEELE's
view, (though obscured by terms derived from a vague and
unfounded general theory,) of the nature of the oxymuriatic
and muriatic acids, may be considered as an expression of
facts ; whilst the view adopted by the French school of che-
mistry, and which, till it is minutely examined, appears 80
beautiful and satisfactory, rests in the present state of our
knowledge, upon hypothetical grounds. MDCCCX. Ii
