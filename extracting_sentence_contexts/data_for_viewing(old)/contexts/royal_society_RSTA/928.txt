aged 29, had written with Jean-Marie Wiame, a microbiologist also working at the Université
Libre de Bruxelles, a brief note in French entitled ‘Biologie et thermodynamique des phénoménes
irréversibles’ [6], where they applied the non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach to the
evolution of biological systems.

Building on the pioneering work of Turing published in 1952 [7], in the 1960s Prigogine
extended his analysis to self-organization in space [8,9]. To stress the fact that non-equilibrium
self-organization in open systems requires the dissipation of energy, Prigogine coined the
term ‘dissipative structures’, so as to distinguish them from equilibrium structures [3,10]. The
conditions for dissipative structures are readily encountered in living systems, which are (i)
open, (ii) governed by nonlinear evolution equations, and (iii) operate far from thermodynamic
equilibrium. A major source of nonlinearity is provided by a variety of feedback processes,
which evolved at the cellular and supracellular levels to optimize the operation and survival
capability of biological systems. The special interest of Prigogine for self-organization in biological
systems is again reflected by the title ‘Structure, dissipation and life’ that he gave in 1967
to the contribution, published in 1969, where he first introduced the concept of dissipative
structures [10].

Dissipative structures occur far from equilibrium when a steady state becomes unstable at
