been shown to have their origin from it. For example, division of the sixth root was
followed by degeneration in the musculo-cutaneous, thus proving that this nerve does
receive fibres from the sixth root in some cases; so, too, the musculo-spiral, about the
origin of which there are discrepancies in the statements of different observers, was
found to have some of its fibres degenerated after division of the seventh root.
Another point of interest in connection with this root was the degeneration found in
the median nerve after division of the root in question. It will be remembered that
stimulation of the seventh root produced contraction of the pronator radii teres
muscle, and that it has been also shown that stimulation of the branch which the
musculo-cutaneous nerve gives to the median just above the bend of the elbow results
in contraction of that muscle, and it alone.

But, in addition to these facts confirmatory of the results obtained by stimulation,
certain interesting points were observed, of which, however, I will only allude to one
in the present paper.

According to the Wallerian law of degeneration, division of a nerve root immediately
on the distal side of the intervertebral ganglion results in degeneration of its peripheral
end, and of that alone, there being no degeneration of the proximal end. In addition
to degeneration of the distal end, as the Wallerian law affirms, I found some degene-
rated fibres in the sensory root between the ganglion and the spinal cord, which points
to the probability thatâ€™ there are some fibres which run through the intervertebral
ganglion, without being connected with the cells of the same. These observations
confirm the statements of JoserH,* whose experiments of division of the root between
the ganglion and the cord showed the existence of such fibres, and which, therefore,
