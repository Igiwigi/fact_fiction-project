Scandium oxalate comes down as a white crystalline powder when oxalic acid or
ammonium oxalate is added to a solution of scandium. If much free mineral acid is
present the precipitation is not immediate ; it begins by a cloudiness, which in a few
minutes increases to a crystalline precipitate, a little scandium oxalate remaining in
the solution. It is slightly soluble in water, weak acids, and more so in solution
of ammonium oxalate. On boiling a mixed oxalate from wiikite in a solution
of ammonium oxalate the portion dissolved was richer in scandium than the
insoluble part. Attempts were made to effect a separation of scandia from the
accompanying earths by making use of this fact. A mixed oxalate of crude earths
was boiled in a strong solution of ammonium oxalate and then filtered, and this

operation was repeated on the residue several times. Ultimately the most soluble
and the least soluble earths were separated and their spectra photographed.
The most soluble earth was nearly all scandia, with a little yttria, and traces of
ytterbia, titania, and lime. The least soluble contained more yttria than scandia, but
not much of either. By a repetition of this process it would not be difficult to effect
a good separation of scandia and yttria; I think the fused nitrate process is simpler
and quicker.
