other structure except the layer of medullary substance, m. Very similar in appear-
ance are the iridescent wings of some of the Carpenter Bees (Xylocopa).

39. Pentatomid ? Sp. Hemiptera.

This was an immature stage of a Pentatomid bug, possibly of Pycanwm rubens,
the wings of which are described below. In alcohol all the chitin is a dull bottle-
green; when dry, a deep blue, except for a dark red line on the dorsal surface.
Sections were made through this line, and Plate 2, fig. 18, shows the point of
junction, p, between it and the iridescent chitin. The latter has a cuticle, c,
beneath which the pigment is quite opaque. The red portion is raised into curious
cone-shaped papilla, b, which contain much less pigment than is shown in the
illustration, The red colour is due to the fact that the underlying tissues, which are
pigmented red, show through the transparent chitinous layer.

40. Pycanum rubens, Fasr. (Malay), Hemiptera.

When alive, the head, pronotum, scutellum, and horny parts of this bug are said to
be a vivid apple-green, and in specimens preserved in alcohol this colour persists. On
drying, the green completely vanishes, leaving a dull purple-brown. A number ot
other insects behave like this, as, for example, the Cetoniid, Stephanocrates thomast,
Kote, upon which a touch of a wet brush will cause a vivid green spot.

On wetting P. rubens the colour returns, and is gradually seen to vanish again as it
slowly dries. The effect of a number of other organic fluids was tried, such as benzol,
