that the relation existing during the spring months when the seminal vesicles and
prostate were growing rapidly, was different from that exhibited in autumn when
the organs were regressing. The data for the months of January to May inclusive,
are given in Table VIII. It can be seen that the relation of the weight of the seminal
vesicles and prostate to the weight of the testes falls into two clearly defined phases.
During the first phase, extending until the testes have attained a weight of approxi-
mately 250 mg, the seminal vesicles and prostate do not exhibit any significant
increase in weight. In the subsequent phase rapid growth in weight correlated
with that of the testes occurs. During both phases the relation evidently approxi-
mates to a straight line regression although the spread in the second phase is
considerable. It is apparent, therefore, that the growth of the seminal vesicles and
prostate relative to that of the testes at the onset of the breeding season exhibits
a marked lag, and does not, in fact, begin until the testes have attained a compara-
tively large size and considerably after the stage at which mature spermatozoa are
found both in the testes and epididymides. Since no animals with testes 250 mg
in weight and over were obtained before March 24, and all animals obtained after
April 16 and before the appearance of young animals of the season had testes over
this weight, it shows that the growth of the seminal vesicles and prostate begins during
this period.

The data for the months of September and October, when the reproductive
organs of mature animals are rapidly regressing at the close of the breeding season,
are given in Table IX. It can be seen that the relation of the weights of the seminal
vesicles and prostate to the weights of the testes during this period is not divisible
into two phases but approximates to a single straight regression line.
