The sensitivity of MAPP to LLPs is investigated by using various benchmark processes. One
such derives from a dark sector model where a Higgs mixing portal admits exotic inclusive B >
X;@ decays, in which ¢ is a light CP-even scalar that mixes with the Higgs, with mixing angle
6 <1 [44]. We use the exclusive decay B — K@ to estimate the fiducial efficiency for the process
B— X,. The fiducial efficiency was estimated to be at maximum several times 10~+. This is a
competitive number that will allow us to substantially expand the discovery reach for the above
process at Run-3.

A number of backgrounds need to be considered even though the MAPP detector is separated
from the IP by 60 interaction lengths The backgrounds from cosmic muons are highly suppressed
for a number of reasons, these are: the shielding provided by the approximately 100m rock
overburden; the fact that cosmics are out of time with respect to LHC collisions; and, the
‘verticality’ of the cosmic muons as opposed to the dominant ‘horizontal’ component of particles
from the IP. Once these factors are taken into account it is clear that muons from the IP are an
important background. In this case, muons directly incident on the detector would be ruled out by
the forward charged particle veto. Another possibility is that muons that just by-pass the forward
veto scatter on air in the tunnel to produce particles that move back into the fiducial volume of
MAPP.

Neutral particles, such as neutrinos, neutrons and K)s, provide another important source of
backgrounds, to which neutrons make the main contribution. Neutrino-air events in the volume
of the MAPP detector arise from two sources: atmospheric neutrinos; and neutrinos from the
IP. The neutrino background from the IP requires a detailed simulation of the material budget
around MoEDAL extending out to MAPP, which is currently in preparation. But, initial estimates
