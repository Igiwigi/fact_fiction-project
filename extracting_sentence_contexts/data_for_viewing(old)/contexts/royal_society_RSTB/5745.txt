We conclude from these facts that dextral break-throughs are probably caused by
the same influence that causes H-ness, just as X-rays may produce monsters and also

* In all our further breeding of « and ¢ strains in 1928 and 1929, only one occurred : 10764 from an
odd dextral in gen. 5 of a « line which broke out of a high ¢ strain (Table 30).

heritable mutations (Mutter, 1928). When the complete conversion to genotypic
dextrality occurs, the excessive embryonic mortality disappears.
