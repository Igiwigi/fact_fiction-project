More recently, assuming
a vast amount of time, e.g. 1-2 GY, thought to have elapsed before an ‘origin event’ took place, it
was said to have occurred with an infinitely improbable accident ‘that only had to happen once’
[5]. But recent paleobiological discoveries have defeated this account showing life emerged not
after some long time, but opportunistically almost immediately as soon as the Earth had cooled
enough after its formation to keep the oceans from evaporating, and opportunistic ordering
continued from there, e.g. multicellular eukaryotes as soon as there was enough oxygen (O2)
in the atmosphere to support them, and larger forms as soon as QO? levels increased further
(figure 2) [21]. Beyond the fact that Darwinism cannot explain the very nature of life, the active, end-directed
striving to fill out the economy of nature, there is a cascade of related problems that follows
from its bracketing off from physics and briefly noted here (for more detail see [3-5,8,20]). The
first is the ‘problem of the population of one’ [5,21], the origin problem just discussed being a
special case. The name comes from the instance of planetary evolution.
