Proof. We start with the formulas

n
u= >> xKun + xp veo
k=l

and
n

Vu =) xcVug t+ xf(ux @ 6 — by @ up) + xf Veo ® 6,
k=l

which follow from the definitions in §4a and the fact that up =—Vv as (-)+ is a counterclockwise
rotation by 2/2. Looking back at the estimates in (3.12) and (3.13), we see that
