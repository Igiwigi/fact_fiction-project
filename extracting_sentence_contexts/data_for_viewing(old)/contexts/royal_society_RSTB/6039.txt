cell-mass just as in other mammals, but the details of the formation of the endodermal
yolk-sac vesicle are not accurately known. He (’09, p. 8) insists that in Tarsius as
in the monkeys and man, “the entoderm cells never clothe the whole of the inner
surface of the trophoblast, the entodermic vesicle remaining of smaller size than the
trophoblastic sphere.” He goes on to say “to a certain extent this is explained
by the fact that another vesicle . . . develops, at an uncommonly early period,
fills up part of the vesicle formed by the trophoblast and prevents the entoderm cells
from reaching the entire outer surface.” The other vesicle to which he refers is that
formed by the extra-embryonal mesoderm enclosing the extra-embryonal coelom
(text-fig. 7, ex.cw.). I find Husrecat’s explanation difficult to follow. His figures
of early blastocysts show that the delaminated endoderm forms at first not a solid
mass, but a layer underlying the embryonal ectoderm and the only way such a layer
can give origin to a vesicle is by spreading in contact with a surface. Such a surface
is provided by the trophoblast, and I suggest that the endoderm spreads round in
contact with it to form a lining to the blastocyst-cavity, just as it does in the Lemur
and the lower mammals, and that it soon becomes separated therefrom, over the
hinder portion of the blastocyst, by the precocious formation of the extra-embryonal
mesoderm and ccelom.
