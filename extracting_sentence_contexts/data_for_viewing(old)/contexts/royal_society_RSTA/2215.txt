According to Stokes’ theorem, the total vorticity over a closed surface S vanishes, which
is equivalent to the constraint 7)_, Mm =0 in terms of the strengths of point vortices. When
the null-space dimension of the configuration matrix is one, we are unable to impose this
constraint on the singular vector vy; to the zero singular value oy, =0, since the sum of

up to N components of vy+1 is not necessarily zero, in general. However, the configuration : =
matrix for most of vortex crystals obtained in this paper has a one-dimensional null space. To : =
avoid this contradictory situation, we assume the existence of a background constant vorticity 1B
uniformly distributed over the surface S to compensate the total strength [otal = vy In. As : =
a matter of fact, vortex crystals on the spherical surface are successfully constructed under this 8
assumption [12,27,28]. In the same spirit, we do not take the constraint of the zero total circulation : o
into consideration in this paper. in

The linear stability of a vortex crystal is verified by computing the eigenvalues to the linearized : s
matrix £¢ R2N*2N of (2.3) around the configuration of the vortex crystal numerically. Since : 3
equations (2.3) are written as a Hamiltonian dynamical system, the eigenvalues of the matrix £ io

become either a pair of real numbers with the opposite signs or a conjugate pair of pure imaginary
numbers. Accordingly, for the eigenvalues {tn yen , of £, let us consider the maximum of the
real part of the eigenvalues, namely, jf = max; <;,<y Re(Hm)- Then, the vortex crystal is linearly

unstable when py > 0, while it is neutrally stable when py =0.
