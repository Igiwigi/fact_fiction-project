vagus effects, which show themselves usually in about a quarter of a minute after the
respiratory arrest.

When the vagi are intact the interruption of the respiration usually leads to
great irregularity of the heart, due in part to excitation of the vagus, seeing that it
does not show itself if the nerves have been cut. That it is not due to the vagus
action alone is sufficiently evident from the fact that it occurs less readily from
simple direct or reflex excitation of the vagus by means of an electric stimulus. That
it is in part due to increased excitability or increased excitation of the ventricles is of
course probable.
