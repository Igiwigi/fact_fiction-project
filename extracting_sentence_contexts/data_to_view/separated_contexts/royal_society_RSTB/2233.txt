In Scutrr’s and
LANGLEY's and certain of Rawa’s experiments, this method did not vitiate the
results, as the two nerves were distributed to entirely different structures; but in
Rawa’s experiments on the nerves of the extremities this method, as stated above,
was not compatible with perfect recovery of the limb, as thereby either the flexor or
the extensor muscles only were innervated, the opposing group being left unsupplied,
a condition necessarily resulting in contracture, which must have made the interpre-
tation of the results extremely dubious. CuNNINGHAM, however, made a double
crossing, and prevented confluent reunion by stitching round each seat of union a
layer of fascia, while Srerant made double crossings in all his experiments except
one, but except in the latter, seems not to have taken precautions to prevent confluent
reunion other than the distance which separated the two points of union. That this
was not a safe procedure is shown from the fact that one of his experiments had to
be rejected on account of confluent reunion. Sreranr’s experiments were not followed by a perfect use of the limb by the
animal, permanent flexion developing in all in which the crossing had been effective. This is to be explained by the fact that he crossed in them the musculo-spiral
with the median only, leaving the ulnar nerve intact.
