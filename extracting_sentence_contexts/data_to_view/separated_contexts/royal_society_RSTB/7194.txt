A strip of white cardboard, part of which was tinted -yellow, was mounted behind an
aperture in a black background, so that white or yellow could be presented to the observer
in turn. It was found that when, with reduction of visual angle, yellow had apparently
changed to white, the yellow could be replaced by white—by moving the strip of cardboard
—without the observer noticing any change in the appearance. This test proved conclusively that when yellow looks white, it has in fact assumed the
appearance of white. This would not be the case unless full colour vision had been replaced
by reduced colour vision. (26) Light and dark adaptation

Light adaptation was carried out by looking at the sky for several minutes; dark adapta-
tion, by screening the eyes completely from light.
