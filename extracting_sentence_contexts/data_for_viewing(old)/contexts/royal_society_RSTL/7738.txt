fore reached this stage.

III. The prominences have been obseryed of yarious colours (this fact is not here
stated merely with reference to the obseryation recorded in ILL ante).

IV. There is @ line in the yellow, most probably proceeding from the substance which
gives off the light at C and F, as the length of this line, as far as the later observations
with the more correctly adjusted instrument go, is the same as that of those in C and P.

I am aware that the conditions as to density cannot for one moment be held to be the
same in the two cases; but as at present (ï¬† far as I know) we have no similar expe-
riments ranging over greatly varying densities, I have thought it desirable to bring these
striking facts forward at once. We are justified in thinking that the density of the
chromosphere, always assuming that it is composed wholly or in part of hydrogen, can-
not be very great ; if it were, the spectrum would most probably be continuous; for Pro-
fessor FRAXKLAND has shown, in the lecture before alluded to, that hydrogen burning in
oxygen under a pressure of ten atmospheres gives out a spectrum, bright, and perfectly
continuous from red to violet.

It is possible that experiments in which both density and temperature are varied may
enable us to match accurately the spectrum of the chromosphere, and thereby determine
both the temperature and pressure at the surface of the sun.

The bright lines which have been observed in several sfars, especially in the remark-
able one in Corona, the outburst of which was spectroscopically watched by Mr. HuGGxs
