Taking averages on the assumption that the correlation for whole siblings should
be double that for half siblings, we have the following results :—

Correlation between colts based on results for whole and half siblings. °6667
Correlation between fillies based on results for whole and half siblings. 7729
Correlation between filly and colt based on results for whole and half

We can draw the following conclusions :—

(i.) In whatever manner we deduce the fraternal correlation it is very much larger
than the ‘4 for whole brethren, or the ‘2 for half brethren, required by the unmodified
Galtonian law. Such values, as we see above, could be deduced from the modified
Galtonian law by taking y greater than unity,* but this would involve values for
the parental correlation sensibly less than those given by theory. We are again
compelled to assert that the modified as well as the unmodified theory of blended
inheritance, based on the Galtonian law, does not fit the facts. The above values,
however, are quite compatible with the theory of exclusive inheritance on the
assumption that there is an individual (not a sexual) prepotency from one pairing to
another.

(ii.) In whatever way we consider it, it would appear that the average value of
the fraternal correlation, as deduced from siblings with the same dam only, is
greater than that deduced from siblings with both the same dam and the same sire. Tam not able to explain this in any way, for I cannot assert a very substantial
prepotency of the dam.
