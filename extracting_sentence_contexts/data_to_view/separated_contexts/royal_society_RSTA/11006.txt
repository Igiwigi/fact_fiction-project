The first striking fact shown by the table is the uniformly slower speeds derived
from the doublet at 4925 as compared with that of the least refrangible line of the
adjoining triplet, and we have assured ourselves that there is no difference in displace-
ment between the two first components of the triplet. The third component is too
weak and too near an air line to admit of satisfactory measurement. It was one of
the main objects of our investigation to discover, if possible, such differences in the
velocities as might indicate the presence of different kinds of molecules, but we
hesitate to ascribe the differences found to such a cause.
