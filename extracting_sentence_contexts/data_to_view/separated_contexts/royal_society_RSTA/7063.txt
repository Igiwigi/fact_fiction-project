demonstrating the cancellation that takes place on forming /,,,(¢). In fact, if R leading
figures of Z,(t) and Z,(t—1) are identical, then R figures are lost ‘off the front’ in
forming f,,,(¢). Since R increases with ¢, this cancellation becomes increasingly severe as
the work progresses, and a large number of significant figures must be retained in the early
sequences of the process. Aitken himself is aware of this difficulty and remarks (1926, p. 294): ‘If it were really
necessary to carry the columns to any great length this [cancellation] would constitute a
defect, but we shall show in a later section how, given a few consecutive terms of a slowly
approximating sequence Z,,, it is in general possible to derive successively other sequences
which give enormously improved results.
