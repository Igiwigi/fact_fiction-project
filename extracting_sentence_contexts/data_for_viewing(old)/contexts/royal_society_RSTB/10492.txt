Also, it indicates that difficulties to allocate attention to visceral
signals are not confined to psychiatric conditions [67] with dif-
fuse brain abnormalities, and may actually result from
relatively circumscribed brain damage. Second, the association
of impaired performance with fronto-temporal-insular and
fronto-insular damage (in bvFTD and FIS, respectively) corrob-
orates the central role of the IC networks in sensing body states,
and of the cingulate and frontal cortices in the integration of
interoceptive information [1,2,12]. In the case of AD, interocep-
tive deficits were associated with hippocampal and temporal
atrophy. As such damage is consistently associated with
impaired memory mechanisms, it seems that cardiac interocep-
tion may also rely on them. In fact, phasic signals from
individual heartbeats are related to such circuits, and partici-
pants with high interoceptive accuracy perform better in
subliminal learning and memory tasks [24]. This finding
further stresses the multidimensional nature of interoception.

Above and beyond those critical regions, interoceptive
accuracy also relies on widely distributed network activity.
Behavioural performance was associated with functional con-
nectivity between fronto-temporo-insular hubs in all groups.
Moreover, abnormal temporo-frontal and IC-IC connections
in each patient group highlighted the crucial role of the IC as
a hub in this dimension [1,2,12], while showing that its
