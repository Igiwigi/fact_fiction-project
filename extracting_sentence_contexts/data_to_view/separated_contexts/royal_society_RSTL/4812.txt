This view is further confirmed by the fact, that while the first steps of this process
take, comparatively speaking, a long time, as s0on as the hour-glass form has been
once acquired, complete division is effected s0 snddenly that it is invisible; while a
violent oscillatory motion is from the same cause communicated to the yolk masses,
taking some little time to subside. The division and movements of the embryonic vesicle, on the contrary, can only be
ascribed to vitality. That this division cannot be produced by the action of the spermatic particles on
Ithe embryonic vesicle, is evident from the fact, that it does not take place from
Swithout inwards, but from within outwards. The embryonic spot divides first ; and

Sthis I have even seen to take place before the germinal vesicle has been ruptured,
Swhile it was still entire (fig. 65 k), and consequently long before the seminal fluid
geould possibly exert any influence over its nucleoli, imbedded as they are in the
Spubstance of the yet solid nucleus (fig. 65 a), surrounded by fluid, and protected by
Sthe germinal vesicle (fig. 65 b).

-S The fissiparous growth of the embryonic spot proves beyond a doubt that its divi-
:S8i0n is caused by vitality inherent in it. E The embryonic vesicle, although owing its division to the nuclei it encloses, is
Salso alive, because it grows in size, and when divided we see it move, not as 80me
S$uppose, by mere electric repulsion ; for I have most distinctly seen it continue to
Erevolve in different directions, and in circles of various diameter.
