These experiments show that in all the cases examined, viz., the combustion of
cyanogen, marsh gas, ethylene, and acetylene, the substitution of nitrogen for the
oxygen required to burn the carbon from carbonic oxide to carbonic acid increases the
velocity of the explosion. These facts seem only consistent with the view that the
carbon burns directly to carbonic oxide, and the formation of carbonic acid is an
after-occurrence.

§ 4. Berraeror’s Experiments bearing on the mode of Combustion of Carbon.

M. Berruetor found that the pressures produced in the explosion of cyanogen
were greater for the incomplete than for the complete combustions.t

* No doubt with a large excess of oxygen the explosion of acetylene would be less retarded than with
a large excess of nitrogen, as in the case of ethylene. Owing to the expense of preparing the acetylene,
experiments with a large excess of oxygen were not made.
