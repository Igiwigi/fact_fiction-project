A striking feature of the island is the somewhat abrupt rise of the
steep forested slopes of the central nuclei, or cores, of the Soufriére Hills and Centre
Hills, the largest mountain groups, above the surrounding more gently sloping
cultivated land (fig. 9, Plate 1). This is mainly due to the fact that the central cores
are made up of solid intrusive bandaite and relatively hard and steeply dipping
agglomerates, while the surrounding deposits, consisting of unconsolidated or semi-
consolidated agglomerates, tuffs, volcanic sands, etc., radiate outwards with a dip that
does not as a rule exceed 10°. In the case of the Soufriére Hills, the youngest volcano, the inclination of the
cultivated slopes between the ghauts is very largely original, as it conforms very closely
to the dip of the tuffs (fig. 26, Plate 4).
