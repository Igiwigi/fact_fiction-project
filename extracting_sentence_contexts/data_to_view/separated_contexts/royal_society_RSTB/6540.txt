of the morphology of the whole skeleton. This paper has never received the attention
that it deserves because it is exceedingly difficult to follow without actual material at

made a series of magnificent preparations of the material of Acanthodes bronnii in Berlin
and elsewhere, but never gave a connected account of the structure which they
showed, contenting himself with partial drawings and descriptions scattered through-
out papers dealing with very different subjects over a period of a quarter of a century,
and indulging in occasional polemics with Reis.
