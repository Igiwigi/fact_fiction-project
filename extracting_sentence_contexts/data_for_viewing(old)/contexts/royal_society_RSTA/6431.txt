Note here that Aj; 4 Aik holds whenever i 4 j (we will guarantee this fact later on, with the result
of lemma 3.4), hence the above expressions are well defined. The roots A1,, 42, and A3,, are indeed
distinct for each value of the frequency k.

To estimate the Fourier coefficient T;(t) in terms of the frequencies k € Z, we need to establish
some related estimates for the roots 41,42, and A3. This will allow us to gain insights into their
