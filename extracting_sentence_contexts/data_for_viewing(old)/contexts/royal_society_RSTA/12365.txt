to Carnivora, but must have met their death in a way which was unusual—such as
from drowning,—for had their bodies remained on a land surface after death, they
would have been subject to being devoured by predaceous animals, or else the bones
would have shown traces of weathering and wear. At the same time the sharply —
fractured state and dispersion of the bones show that they must have been subjected
to considerable violence and displacement. These conditions, as well as the mode of
distribution of the rubble from many independent centres, accord in all points with
the results that would ensue from the submergence and re-elevation of a land surface
from beneath deep waters after a temporary submergence. :
These conclusions, startling though they may appear,* have been forced upon me,
not only by my own observations in the South of England, and parts of the —
Continent, but also by the independent evidence of other geologists, though their
interpretation of the facts may be different. Looked at in all its aspects, I see no
alternative that equally well answers to all the conditions of the problem. Other

* Viewed by our own standard the depth of submergence appears excessive, but in dealing with a
body of the volume of the globe and with a surface length of 3000 miles or more, the deflection of the
crust would appear really comparatively slight.

explanations* may satisfy some of the conditions in particular cases, but none of them
atisfy all, whereas I think it will be found that the submergence hypothesis not
only meets the requirements of each particular case, but that it also shows them
