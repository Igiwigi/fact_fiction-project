g Special activation processes in solid explosives

> In addition to the aspects of sensitiveness which can best be obtained from a study of
liquid explosives, the solid state presents a number of fresh problems. One example is the
& effect of shearing stresses, which may break the crystals and initiate detonation (Carl 1940).
<= Two comments may be made:
S (a) In cases where shearing stress, leading to breaking of the crystals, can initiate detona-
~j tion, the probability of occurrence will diminish with decreasing size of crystals. This is due
3 to the fact that a crystal will break through shear only if this exceeds the holding strength of
E any crystal flaws. With small crystals the chance of slipping over one another will be
increased, and a breakage of a single crystal will be less likely.
a A sure sign that shear sensitiveness is important is that the addition of lubricants has
a beneficial effect, e.g. with cheddites (chlorate mixtures) and with cyclonite.

(b) In addition to the breaking strength under shearing stresses, the lattice energy of
the solid explosive will be of decisive importance. The lattice energy may be defined as the total heat required to convert the crystal to
a gas.
