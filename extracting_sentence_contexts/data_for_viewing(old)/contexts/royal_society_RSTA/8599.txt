Photographs of excellent quality were obtained of the sequences A 4380, 4 4737,
2 5165, and 4 5635 in the second order of a 21-foot concave grating having a dispersion
of 1:3 A per mm. The 6191 sequence in the orange was photographed satisfactorily in
the first order, as was also the 6857 sequence, with sufficient strength to yield measure-
ments of most of the heads. Wellington anti-screen plates were used in the blue region,
and Ilford extra-rapid panchromatic plates for the rest of the spectrum, excepting the
4 5635 group, which was photographed on Marion iso-record plates. ‘l'ables I, II, III
and IV give detail of all the fine structure of the 44 5165, 4737, 5635 and 6191 groups
observed on these plates, together with the additional structure in the case of the
AA 5165 and 4737 bands obtained from are photographs. ‘The heads only have been
measured in the 4380 “ group of three,” and in the red group. There is no doubt that the
former group constitutes a part of the Swan spectrum, representing, in fact, the vibrational
transitions (2, 0), (3, 1), and (4, 2); but the complexity of its fine structure, which

appears different from that of the other bands, will necessitate a third or fourth order
photograph before it can be analysed. The quality of the definition obtained makes
it probable that the relative values of the wave-lengths recorded in Tables I, Il and
III may be relied on to about 0-002 A.U., and those of Table IV to about 0-005 AU.
The absolute values were obtained from measurements of a number of plates, and are
