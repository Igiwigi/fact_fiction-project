In the circumstances of M. SERRULAs's experiments, it is
therefore obvious that his mercury must have been always
sensibly impregnated with potassium and the supernatant
liquid, a solution of potash ; and that it was 80, is proved by
the effects of the electric current, which agree precisely with
those I have stated, as being always produced in such cir-
cumstances (Articles 18, 28;) but the cause assigned to these
effects by Mr. S. viz. the electro-positive energy of the pellicle,
is proved not to be the real one by the simple fact, that the
violence of the motion is always proportional to the cleanli-
ness of the surface, and is greatest when there is no pellicle at
all; besides which, the pellicle here consisted of metallic bis-
muth, a substance incapable of producing any such effect as
shown in Art. g8.

61. The gyration of the fragments is produced as follows :
astrong Voltaic excitement takes place at the point of contact
of two metals s0 different as mercury and potassium. The
mercury becomes strongly positive, and the floating frag-
ments negative.
