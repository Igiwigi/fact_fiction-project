65 In 1825 Faravar || published some experiments on the supersaturated solutions of
SGLAUBER's salt. GrAnantd, TurNER**, URE, and others also contributed new facts; but
the most elaborate inquiry was made by M. L6wEL between the years 1850 and 1857, the
Aresults of which are contained in six memoirsfF. According to this writer, the modified
salt is formed in consequence of a molecular change which takes place when a solution
saturated at 218* Faur. cools down to 64‚Äù. The modified salt is much more s0luble at
ordinary temperatures than the 10-atom hydrate, its maximum solubility being at 80*6.
