Properties of cs and of &.—We have already seen by projection that five chords of
c; meet a general line of 8, and by the same method it appears that only two meet a
secant of c, at points not on c;. Hence the chords of ¢, form a locus of order five M;°
having ¢, as triple line. Since ¢; is elliptic we can identify every point of it by an elliptic
parameter, every chord by a parameter pair, and every trisecant plane by a parameter
triad. Five points of ¢, willlie in a prime if their parameter sum is congruent to a certain
fixed value which we can take to be zero. Chords (u,v) then, for which uv = k,a
constant, generate a cubic surface V passing through c;. For if we project from a point
of ¢s, this curve projects into an elliptic quartic c, in ordinary space ; and I projects
into the quadric through ¢,, generated by those chords (uw, v) of c, for which w +- v = &.
Hence there ure «: cubic ruled surfaces containing the curve cs, and these generate
the whole locus of chords M,°. Also it is in fact to these very surfuces V that the
generating lines of F.§ correspond. For being generated by chords of cs, they correspond

only to curves of = lying on F,° ; and since a -quadric meets each of the surfaces in
c, and therefore in only one chord of ¢; beside, the curves must be the generators of
F, as stated.

* The order of the surface in question is just the number of lines which meet six planes in [4]; and this

is known to be five. See Seare ‘ Rend. Palermo,’ II, pp. 45-52 (1888), in which he gives an account of
the quintic surface in question and the duality between F and Y.
