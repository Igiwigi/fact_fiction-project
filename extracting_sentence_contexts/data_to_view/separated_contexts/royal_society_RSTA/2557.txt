variation for the particular season, over the period for which data have been used,
except for small corrections to be applied (i) to the amplitudes of the components, on
account of the fact that the epochs are changing continuously, while we have treated
the group of days corresponding to each lunar phase as though each of the days of the
group was centred precisely at that phase (this makes the computed amplitude
smaller than it should be) ; and (ii) to the epochs also, in case the civil times adopted
for lunar hour 0 and the phases of new moon, &c., have been the times appropriate to
the meridian of Greenwich instead of to the meridian of the observatory dealt with. The former correction, to the amplitudes, is effected by multiplying the computed
amplitudes C,, Cs, C, or the corresponding a, b coefficients, by 1°02, 1°02, and 1°11
respectively.*

$6. The correction to the epochs is found as follows: we consider a place in West
longitude L’, for which the civil times of lunar hour 0 and of new moon first-eighth
phases, &c., appropriate to Greenwich have been used instead of the local times.
