2 are all confluent with the overlying membrane-bones ; s0 also are the palatine bony

Z tracts with the bones above them. In the inner and lower face of the undefined orbit,

Z the sphenoidal fissure (IT., Vb2.) is geen as a large channel, opening obliquely ; this is

Z queto the fact that the alisphenoid (al.s.) embraces the orbitosphenoid (0.5.), growing

g freely outside it.

p= The eurious, low-lying, oblong squamosal (s9.) opens in front as two short blunb

S blades, which seem to bite the outspread alisphenoid ; this is due to the fact that,

Y whilst the jugal process is aborted and has no jugal bone to lie upon, the condyle

S (glenoid cavity) has become snbdivided into two tracts of articular cartilage, one

& above and one below. Thus the two-faced condyloid head of the lower jaw

(tigs. 3, 4, cd.p.) is really held between the two blades of the squamosal. In the

crescentic hollow behind these blades the normal pneumatic foramen is seen ; the bone

there is narrower, then broadens somewhat, and then, dipping gently, ends as a rounded
