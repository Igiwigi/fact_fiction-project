There was no proof then, that the muriatic acid had been
decompounded in these experiments; and there was every
reason to consider it as containing in its common aeriforny
state, at least one third of its weight of water ; and this con-
clusion we shall find warranted by facts, which are imme-
diately to follow.

Inow made a number of experiments, with the hopes of
obtaining the muriatic acid free from water.

I first heated to whiteness, in a well luted porcelain retort, a
mixture of dry sulphate of iron, and muriate of lime which had
been previously ignited; but a few cubic inches of gas only, were
obtained, though the mixture was in the quantity of several
ounces; and this gas contained sulphureous acid. I heated dry
muriate of lime, mixed both with phosphoric glass and dry bo-
racic acid, in tubes of porcelain, and of iron, and employed the
