Why are there so many explanations for
primate brain evolution? Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B

The question as to why primates have evolved unusually large brains has
received much attention, with many alternative proposals all supported by
evidence. We review the main hypotheses, the assumptions they make
372: 20160244. and the evidence for and against them. Taking as our starting point the
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0244 fact that every hypothesis has sound empirical evidence to support it, we
argue that the hypotheses are best interpreted in terms of a framework of
evolutionary causes (selection factors), consequences (evolutionary windows
of opportunity) and constraints (usually physiological limitations requiring
resolution if large brains are to evolve). Explanations for brain evolution
