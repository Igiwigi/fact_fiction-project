effect has been called ‘the effect of specific localization’ [43]. The explanation of this fact includes
the idea that the discharge localization is managed by the rule of minimal electrical field, required
for the discharge maintenance, along the line of breakdown. It can be supposed that the discharge
‘prefers’ the path in the fuel, oxidizer or between them depending on conditions and the phase of
discharge development. If the medium is non-homogeneous, the favoured path may not be the
shortest one. Tests and computational analysis of plasma properties in fuel-air (C2H4-air in this
particular case) mixtures of various compositions demonstrate [35,42,44] that the best conditions
for discharge development may be realized in the air-fuel mixture but in air or in fuel.

Special tests were arranged to prove the effect of discharge specific localization in high-
speed two-component flow [42]. The experimental approach includes the following key points:
supersonic duct-driven airflow M=0.3 and M=2.5; direct wall injection of gaseous fuel or
model gas; and transversal short-pulse repetitive electrical discharge, crossing air—fuel-air zone.
