(e) Exosomes as therapeutics

The ability of exosomes to travel between cells and deliver their
cargo ina highly specific and efficient manner makes them an
appealing therapy option to treat brain disorders. For instance,
treatment options for multiple sclerosis (MS) are limited and
consist of immunosuppressors or agents to prevent immune
infiltration of the brain. However, these therapies have poten-
tially harmful side effects, and in fact do very little to promote
myelin repair. It was recently reported that interferon gamma-
stimulated dendritic cell-derived exosomes increased baseline
myelination and improved recovery in a MS model by
inducing demyelination [28]. Furthermore, when nasally
administered to whole animals, these exosomes stimulated
an increase in brain myelin.

Another group has demonstrated that exosomes derived
from cultured cells can be harnessed for delivery of small
interfering RNAs (siRNA) in vivo in a mouse brain [29]. Self-
derived dendritic cells were used for exosome production in
order to reduce immunogenicity. Targeting was achieved by
