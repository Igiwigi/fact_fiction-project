We may conclude, therefore, that element La either
has no cortical connections with the frontal and parietal lobes at all, or, if they are
present, they must be very few and scattered. Element ZÃ© lies at the dorsal surface of the thalamus and can with difficulty be
differentiated morphologically from the subjacent ventral nucleus (pars externa). However, it is distinguished from the latter by certain features of its cytoarchitecture
and by the fact that fillet fibres have not hitherto been traced into it. In all our
experiments in which the cortical lesion in the parietal lobe has been confined to the
area post-centralis (experiments A, B, C, and D), cell degeneration has been limited
to the pars externa of the ventral nucleus. On the other hand, in experiment E,
in which the lesion involved the post-central area and portions of areas 5 and 7,
cell atrophy was found in the pars externa of the ventral nucleus and also in the
caudal half of nucleus Lb.
