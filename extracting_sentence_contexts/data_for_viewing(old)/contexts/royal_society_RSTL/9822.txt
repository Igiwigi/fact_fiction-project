CURRENTS IN INFINITE PLATES AND SPHERICAL SHELLS. 315

where @1, wg, wg are the angular velocities of the element at z, y, 22 We cannot,
therefore, look upon þ as the potential of free electricity ; in fact it is easy to see that
there will be no free electricity inside it, just as when it, was at rest, Tf the conductor
be symmetrical about an axis, and revolve about it sufficiently long for the currents to
become steady, the total current will become identical with the conduction current, and
there will be no flow across the surface, We may then take at every point of the

gurface
lu+mv+nw=0.

The triple integrals in the expressions for F, G, H are then to be taken only
