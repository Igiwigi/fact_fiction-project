normal distance. (a) Successive profiles corresponding to different Re (figure 4b) are offset by A(u'*+)? = 3 for clarity. Grey
symbols indicate single-wire results corrected for spatial resolution effects as described in [28]; X-wire measurements are
fully resolved. Dashed lines indicate the prediction of the near-wall peak amplitude based on a compilation of simulations
and experiments [54], i.e. (w2)+ = 3.63 + 0.65 In R*. (b) Only profiles for R*+ > 2.4 x 10* are shown. The black solid line
indicates the logarithmic profile obtained through a fit to the data between 0.025 < y/R < 0.25 (range being indicated
through dashed lines); yielding Ay = 1.30, By = 1.81 and B) = 1.91 for equation (4.1), with free parameters and A, fixed to
the value of 1.26 found in [32], respectively. The red solid line represents DNS at Rt = 3008 [22]. (Online version in colour.)

yt (Rt)? values of 2.6-3.9 [7,32,50]. It should be noted that, while the location of the lower
bound for the logarithmic region in the aforementioned studies is found empirically, there is a
physical basis, as argued by Klewicki and co-workers [52,53]: this position, in fact, should locate
the start of the region where the mean dynamics lose a leading-order viscous effect. This thus
ensures a correspondence between the aforementioned empirical observation and the classical
notion that the logarithmic layer is an ‘inertial sublayer’ in physical space.

Considering the streamwise variance profiles in inner scaling (figure 5a), the profiles
from the X-wire measurements in both the streamwise/spanwise and streamwise /wall-normal
configurations agree exceptionally well with each other and are in agreement with the single-
wire measurements, except for the lowest Reynolds number. This discrepancy might be related to
difficulties in the calibration at low velocities, say mean velocities below 5m s~!, in which case the
calibration needs to be accurate down to nearly 1 ms-! [55], which could not be ensured for the
in situ calibration of the boundary-layer probes. Although the streamwise variance profile exhibits
a mild second peak, the fact that the wire length in inner units L* increases up to 40 and 80 viscous
