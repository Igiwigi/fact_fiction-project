12. The result obtained by Ramsay and Young, and others, that all over the gas-
liquid range the characteristic equations of the substances on which they experimented
proved to be very approximately of the form p = aT + b, where a and b are functions
of the density alone, also supplies corroboration to this view. Expressing the
increment of energy per unit mass dE = Mdv + «dT, we have for the increment
of heat supplied dH = dE + pdv; and the fact that dE and dH/T are perfect
differentials shows immediately that M is equal to — b and « is independent of v; so
that the total (non-constitutive) energy per unit mass consists of two independent
parts, an energy of expansion and an energy of heating. * The latter part is the
thermal energy of the individual molecules ; it is a function of their mean states and
velocities alone, and constitutes almost all the energy in the gaseous state.
