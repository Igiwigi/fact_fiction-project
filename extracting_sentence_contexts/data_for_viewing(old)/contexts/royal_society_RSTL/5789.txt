other position. There is never to be seen anything indicating the existence of an
attractive force drawing the corpuscles towards each other: they merely stick together
when brought into contact by accidental causes. Their adhesiveness does not affect
themselves alone, but other substances also, as may be seen when blood is in motion
in an extremely thin film between two plates of glass, when they may be observed
sicking for 'a longer or shorter time to one of the surfaces of the glass, each one
dragging behind it a short tail-like process; and as the moyement of the blood dimi-
nishes $0 as to permit the formation of rouleaux, the latter may be not I
unfrequently seen adhering in the same way by one of their terminal
corpuscles, as represented in the accompanying diagram.

That the cylindrical character of the aggregated masses is an accidental result of the
shape of the blood-discs, is evident from the fact, that in
the frog, although the same tendency to agglutination of =
the corpuscles exists as in Mammalia, yet, as their bi-
convex form renders it mechanically impossible for them
to be applied to one another throughout their entire cir-
cumference, they become arranged in groups of an irre-
gular form, as is shown in the annexed s8ketch of blood
contained in a small vein of the frog's web.

Again, different specimens of mammalian blood differ very much in the amount of *
adhesiveness of their corpuscles ; and when this property exists beyond a certain degree:
