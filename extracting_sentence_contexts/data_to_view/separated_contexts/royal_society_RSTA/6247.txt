Therefore, understanding the dynamics of how dissolved gasses enter the lower limb of
the overturning circulation is of central importance and calls for direct observations of dissolved
gasses alongside classical physical variables. Such efforts are underway through GOHSNAP
in the subpolar North Atlantic and the Atlantic BiogeoChemical fluxes program at the RAPID


array [51,82] and should become a standard part of AMOC observations and analyses. Given the
significance of the DWBC pathway and the fact that it is undersampled by Biogeochemical Argo
floats, moored dissolved gas measurements at targeted western boundary locations should be an
AMOC observing priority. Data accessibility. The Overturning in the North Atlantic Program observations shown in figures 2 and 3 can
