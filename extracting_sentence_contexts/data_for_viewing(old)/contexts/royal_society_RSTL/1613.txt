I: is now just a century since Mr. GRAnam discovered the
daily change in the variation of the horizontal needle, subse-
quent to which time numerous observations have been made
on the same subject by WARGENTIN, CanToxn, G1Lpiy, Colonel
Beavroy and others, which have all confirmed, with certain
shades of variety, the general fact as first described by the
ingenious philosopher above named.

The actual daily change however is so small, even in the
horizontal needle, that it can only be detected with the most
careful observations and with the most delicate instruments ;
and in the dipping needle that change, if any, is so extremely
minute, as hitherto to have escaped observation : for it was
only in the year 1820, that the Royal Academy of Sciences
of Copenhagen proposed the determination of this motion, on
satisfactory experiments, as the prize subject for that year;
but the prize, I understand, has never been adjudged, no
satisfactory communication having been received.
