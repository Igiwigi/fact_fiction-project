Or, in other words, an
error rate of approximately 1 in 10? initiation events in
yeast and approximately 1 in 10’ in human cells is 6. PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES
required to achieve this 99 per cent probability. Given = The calculations described above are, by necessity,
the fact that even very limited re-replication is lethal in not based on any ‘real’ numbers. For example, what is
yeast [68,72,92], it is highly likely that the overall block the actual rate of re-initiation in wild-type cells in vivo?
to re-initiation in wild-type cells is considerably greater Previous plasmid loss assays in yeast have suggested
than 99 per cent. that the rate of re-initiation per origin is less than 1 in
10°? [96], which was the limit of detection in this
assay. However, as described above, the real number is
5.
