And y is the longitude of the descending node of the equator, and therefore the
direction cosines of the earth's axis, drawn northwards are, |
gin 7 cos (+4), 8in 7 8in (+4), cos 7; or since 7 is 8mall, —: sin yþ, 2 cos vþ, 1. |
Now draw a sphere of unit radius, with the origin as centre ; draw a tangent plane |
