represent the nitrogen taken into the blood with the food. On the other hand, if the
bulk of the muscles increase with sufficient food, there will be a loss in the excretion of
nitrogen, because there has been an appropriation of it.

Hence the evident relation of urea must be with food, although it m : ;
partly from tissue and partly from food ; and the precise correspondence in quantity will
be regulated by the relation of appropriation to excretion of nitrogen in the tiggues. As
the urea is derived from various sources, it is impossible that it can measure either tissue-
waste or food separately.
