in fact was designed, to reduce the thickness of the film by evaporation, and would

- thus alter its constitution. Liprcs, anticipating the objection that the effect observed may have been due to
the larger proportion of water absorbed by the older and thinner film, points to similar
results obtained with a decoction of Quillaja. He appears to have overlooked the fact
that if the experiments were performed in a dry atmosphere, the cold produced by
evaporation might have been the true cause in both cases. The difficulty of estimating accurately what the magnitude of the effect of snch
a cause might be was much enhanced by the fact that no observations had been made
on the amount of water gained or lost by a soap film in a given time. The retrogression
of the colours, which, after indicating for some time a decrease, often show an increase
in thickness, had indeed been observed by PLateau.
