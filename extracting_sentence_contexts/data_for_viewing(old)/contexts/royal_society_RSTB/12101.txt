Ideally, a definition of exposure used in rule-making
would be based on definitions in published peer-reviewed
analyses. Such definitions do exist (e.g. [18]), but key data
on ACP numbers needed to adapt the definitions for urban
California are lacking. This is because once a region is con-
sidered to be ‘generally infested’ with psyllids, no further
estimates of vector population density tend to be made.

However, as already noted, there are accurate records of
verified infected hosts. This allows the possibility of exploit-
ing the fact that the vector and host dynamics are coupled, to
use the infected tree data as a proxy for the missing psyllid
data, and to construct the definition of exposure primarily
from the disease incidence data, knowing that pathogen
spread is essentially impossible without the involvement of
the vector. The basic concept is well known in the analysis
of population time-series data [19,20]. The implicit involve-
ment of the vector in disease spread allows the time-series
of disease detections to be expressed in terms of its own his-
tory alone, even though the underlying process, in which the
vector exposes the trees to infection, involves coupled
dynamics between two populations. In other words, pre-
cisely because the system has a biological interdependence
