DR. A. GAMGEE ON THE ACTION OF NITRITES ON BLOOD. 621

On the Nature of the Action which Nitrites exert on the Colouring-matter of Blood.

| Whatever might be the nature of the change induced by nitrites in hamoglobin,
Wreculted from my experiments that it could not be one which deeply altered the con-
stitution of the substance, seeing that the addition of certain reagents at once caused
all the effects of the action to disappear and revealed the continued existence of oxidized
hemoglobin in the blood. Nitrites had, by my experiments, been shown to resemble in
no way those agents which thrust oxygen out of the blood ; on the other hand, it had
been proved that the action of nitrites resulted in the locking up of the oxygen of the blood
80 as to render it irremoyeable by CO or by a vacuum. A consideration of all the facts
which I had observed led me to believe that probably nitrites might actually link them-
selves to oxidized hemoglobinâ€”a supposition which has been verified in the most ample
2 manner.
= Tn the experiments now to be described I have always made use of hemoglobin pre-
= pared from the blood of the Dog, in the following manner. The dog whose blood was
= to be used for the preparation of hemoglobin was kept for a considerable time under
5 the influence of chloroform, and then bled to death.
= The blood was allowed to coagulate, and the serum separated as completely as pos-
Z sible.
2 After twenty-four hours the blood-clot was broken up and firmly squeezed in linen or
S calico. 'The red fluid thus expressed was mixed with one and a half times its yolume
22 of distilled water, and set aside for three or four hours. At the end of that time the
