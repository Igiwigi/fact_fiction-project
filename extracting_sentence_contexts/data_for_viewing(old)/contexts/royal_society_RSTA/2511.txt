IAT with the explicit feeling thermometers provides complementary information on explicit
preferences of greenspace with and without SuDS and further evaluates attitudes towards
attractiveness, safety and tidiness to provide the first comparative quantification, to date, of these
perceptions.

The IAT contributes additional insight that cannot be captured by explicit tests that suffer
from social desirability bias and can uncover hidden perceptions that are more entrenched in
each respondent’s value system. Greenspace with and without SuDS is perceived positively by
the sample population in Newcastle, suggesting that they are valued components of landscapes
and developments. Overall, greenspace without SuDS was implicitly and explicitly preferred,
and greenspace without SuDS regarded as more attractive, tidier and safer. However, the
wide distribution of implicit and explicit tests scores for greenspace with SuDS illustrates the
complexity of public perceptions of blue-green space. The fact that the strongly negative explicit
scores were not reflected in the implicit scores may suggest that explicit attitudes towards tidiness
and safety may not be deep-rooted and may be subject to some social bias influenced by, for
example, concerns around public space that are deemed to be more socially acceptable. For
instance, the data suggest that a small proportion of respondents are more concerned about
tidiness and safety than they instinctively feel, perhaps because they are rationalizing about the
advantages and disadvantages associated with SuDS and consciously decide to highlight socially
acceptable concerns, such as tidiness and safety. Although safety and tidiness are important
features of SuDS, designers should take care not to put too much weight on strongly negative
preferences expressed by a minority. Residential proximity to SuDS, which was investigated by
comparing responses from residents living in properties within 500 m of the NGP SuDS, or near
to large areas of recreational greenspace in Benton, did not significantly influence test scores.
Several factors may instead influence perceptions, including respondents’ broader environmental
