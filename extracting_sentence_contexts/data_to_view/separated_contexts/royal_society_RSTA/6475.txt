3 Tt will be observed, on comparing these results with those obtained in 1875,* that
the neutral point here is between 8 mm. and 3 mm., whereas in the former case it
S\was between 0°8 mm. and 0:3 mm, TI, however, attach little importance to this, as
the older apparatus was much more sensitive than the one now used.t The important
#fact is that in each case the direction changes at a high exhaustion, and then the
= movement becomes five times as strong as it was originally.

& The motive force producing these rotations is, at high exhaustions, the molecular
g impacts between adjacent surfaces of the suspended cylinders excited by the radiation
€ falling on them from the hot water, hot spiral, or a candle (which is equally effective).

© * Loc. cit. A + “The barometric position of the neutral point dividing attraction from repulsion varies according
to circumstances; among these may be mentioned the density of the substance on which radiation falls,
the ratio of its mass to its surface, its radiating- and conducting-power for heat, the physical condition
of its surface, the kind of gas filling the apparatus, the intensity of radiation, and the temperature of
the surrounding atmosphere. When the surface exposed to radiation is pith, the neutral point is some-
what low.
