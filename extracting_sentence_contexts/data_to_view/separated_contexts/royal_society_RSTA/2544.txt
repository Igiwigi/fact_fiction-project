The only way to check a proof
is to reproduce it, ie., to completely repeat the underlying computation. Checking the
correctness of an existing proof is a creative process, whose complexity is comparable
to the complexity of the search for the proof. Actually, in many serious cases, it might be
far easier for an expert (familiar with the basic ideas and techniques used) to find a new
independent proof of the same fact than to verify the details of an existing proof.

e Very few serious mathematical theorems have completely formalized proofs or, for that matter,
even such proofs that could be predictably completely formalized within the time,
computational power and other resources accessible to the human race today. Correctness of a proof does not belong to logic, it is in the realm of Psychology and Sociology
[2,3]. On the individual level, a proof is considered to be correct provided it convinces
us of the validity of a result to the extent that we are prepared to persuade others.
