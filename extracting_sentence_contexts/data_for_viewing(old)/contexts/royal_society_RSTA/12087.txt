carbon flame burnt with air or with oxygen. It invariably appears in sparks passed
through steam, and it also comes out as a reversed line under suitable conditions in
the Bessemer spectrum.

The conditions of its appearance do not depend upon an alteration in temperature,
but on the presence of a sufficient amount of water-vapour in the blast.

This certainly seems to point toa higher temperature than that accorded to the

flame by Warts. Finally, we have this striking fact to consider: when slag from the
converter is ignited at the highest temperature of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, the red
potassium, the red lithium, and the yellow sodium lines are present exactly as they
are seen in the Bessemer-flame, but neither the orange lithium line nor the sodium
pair 5681, 5687 appear ; yet there must be a maximum amount of alkalies in the slag,
or in other words all the alkali metals in the charge are concentrated in the slag---
this maximum, however, being an extremely small quantity.
It is worth while to take into account the heat of combustion of the elements in
pig iron which are removed during the “blow,” and calculate, so far as data are avail-
s able, the absolute heating effect of their oxidation. Any calculations of the kind
& must necessarily be incomplete, owing to the specitic heats of gases at high tempera-
8 tures being undetermined, though these have been lately investigated by BerrHE.or
§ and Visrtir,* also by Matiarp and Le Cuarerter.t The specific heats of molten
