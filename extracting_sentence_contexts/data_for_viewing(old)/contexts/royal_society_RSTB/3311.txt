So far, then, as regards Paleozoic records, wood possessing Araucarian characters
does not in itself afford evidence of the existence of the Araucaries. Scorr has
expressed the view that the secondary wood alone is of little value as a guide
to affinity; this statement would seem to imply that secondary wood of the
Araucarian type from Mesozoic rocks is evidence of minor importance in connection
with the past history of the Araucarie. While admitting the truth of this state-
ment so far as it concerns Paleozoic specimens, we are disposed to accept Mesozoic
examples as indications of the existence of plants nearly related to Araucaria and
Agathis. We are, however, not restricted to this kind of testimony ; our conclusions
as to the age of the Araucariez are based on evidence afforded by different classes o
facts,

(ii) Vegetative Twigs.—The botanical value of vegetative twigs is frequently mis-
leading, and there is no doubt that many of the identifications of fossil Conifers founded
on imperfectly preserved branches are valueless, Among recent Conifers which exhibit
a fairly close resemblance to Araucarian shoots of the Eutacta section we may cite
Cryptomeria japonica and certain species of Dacrydium. Among the numerous
Coniferous branches of Mesozoic age simulating Araucaria we have species of
Brachyphyllum,* Cheirolepis, Sphenolepidium, and other artificial genera.

(iii) Stem-casts, etc.—Fossil casts are occasionally found which bear so close a
resemblance in their surface markings to stems of recent genera that one is tempted
to hazard a guess as to their affinity. If we do not allow our opinion the weight
