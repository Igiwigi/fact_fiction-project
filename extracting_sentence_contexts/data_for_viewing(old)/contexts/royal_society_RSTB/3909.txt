included, whereas these more Southern areas are not really cognate to the Welsh
Borderland system.

The Wyre Forest coalfield, the Northern half of which lies in Shropshire, and the
Southern in Worcestershire,* is a southerly continuation of Coalbrookdale (see

map, p. 367). The outcrop of the so-called grey measures of the two coalfields is in
fact continuous near Bridgnorth, where, however, it is very narrow, being only a few
hundred yards across. The red rocks of the Permians (so-called) are, however,
continuous over a very much wider area. In Coalbrookdale and Wyre Forest we
are in fact dealing with a single area, but this is of so large an extent, and the
geology of the northern half is so very different from that of the southern that it is
more than a matter of convenience to subdivide the whole region into two natural
areasâ€”Coalbrookdale and Wyre Forest. We shall have to discuss in some detail,
at a later stage, the relationships of these two districts.

As we shall see from the historical sketch, which forms the next section of this
paper, the geology of the Wyre Forest is very complicated, and at present very
little understood. This is largely due to the fact that the Forest, regarded from
a coal-winning standpoint, is only a minor coalfield, and consequently but little
