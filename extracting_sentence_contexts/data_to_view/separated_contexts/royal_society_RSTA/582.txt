We shift the value of y to Fas given
in equation (7.1), and obtain the values of L, Land I; table 1 gives the parameters that reproduce
the market correlation function. We then obtain the values of a and f that reproduce the market
values of Ely] and Ely], with the results given in table 2. The fact that the best fit for a, B lies
within the perturbative range makes the calibration accurate and efficient. A consistent interpretation of the potential function V in terms of supply and demand requires
that all the coefficients a,b,c,d are positive; the empirical values given in table 2 are all positive,
hence verifying that the potential can be interpreted in terms of concept of supply and demand. The complete calibration of the microeconomic Lagrangian for the different commodities
allows us to express the potentials directly in terms of the prices of the commodities.
