showing any appearance of parasitism, and never produced fruit; neither could I
discover any traces of mycelium in the tissues of the leaf at these points where the
spores were sown.

Returning to the results of the experiments made with the spores of Stachybotrywm
lobulatum and Torula herbarum. No signs of injury to the host-plant followed
sowings of spores of the first-named, and no trace of mycelium was detected in the
tissues, nevertheless the spores germinated readily in a hanging drop consisting of
a 2-per-cent. solution of cane sugar. It is obvious that for some unknown reason,
the germ-tubes of Stachybotryum could not effect an entrance into the Begonia leat.

With Torula herbarum the case was very different ; those areas of the leaf over
which the spores were sown soon showed signs of internal disturbance; in fact,
these symptoms were more pronounced than in the ease of Ziichotheciitm, and
sections of the leaf showed a fair development of mycelium in the intercellular
spaces. Nevertheless the fungus never produced fruit on the surface of the leaf
over the infected areas, and this I consider as the most important evidence of
parasitism. The results were as described above in twelve sowings, out of which
seven showed indications of mycelium in the tissues. In one example where the
appearance of the infected area indicated special activity of mycelium in the leaf, I
tore a small slit in the epidermis with a fine needle, and at the expiration of two
days a copious growth of spores was produced in the opening made in the epidermis.

These spores, as soon as their power to germinate had been determined, were
sown on injected patches of Begonia leaves, but the result was as previously
