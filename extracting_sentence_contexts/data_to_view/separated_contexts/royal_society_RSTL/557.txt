A piece of white taffeta riband, which
had been wetted with the solution, and thoroughly dried in the
dark, was suspended in a clean dry phial of very fine trans-
parent glass; and the phial, being well stopped with a dry cork,
was exposed to the strong light of a bright sun. After the riband had been exposed, in this manner, to the
action of the sun's direct rays about half an hour, there were
here and there some faint appearances of a change of its colour;
but it showed no disposition to take that deep purple hue which

the riband had always acquired, when exposed to the light in
the preceding experiments. On taking the riband out of the phial, and wetting it tho-
roughly with distilled water, and exposing it again, while thus
zweited, to the sun's rays, it almost instantly began to. change
colour, and s0on became of a deep purple tint; but, though 1
examined the surface of the riband with the utmost care, and
with a good lens, both during the experiment and after it, I
could not perceive the smallest particle of revived gold, nor did
I 8ee any vestige remaining that appeared to indicate that any
had in fact been revived. This experiment was repeated several times, and always with
results which led me to conclude, (what indeed was reasonable
to expect,) that light has little eftect in changing the colour of
metallic oxides, as long as they are in a state of crystallization. The heat which is generated by the absorption of the rays of
light must necessarily, at the moment of its generation at least,
exist in almost infinitely small spaces; and consequently, it is
only in bodies that are inconceivably small that it can produce
durable effects, in any degree indicative of its extreme intensity.
