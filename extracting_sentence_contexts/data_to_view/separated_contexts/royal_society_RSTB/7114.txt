SHARIF ON THE EFFECTS OF

shorter than with 35° C. This shows that with the rise of temperature the desiccating
influence of a humidity is enhanced, which is also borne out by the larvae of X. cheopis
when kept at 40% R.H. with 27 and 32° C. The fact that all the larvae of X. cheopis died
within a day at 60% R.H. and 37° C indicates its fatal drying effect at this temperature.

Ficure 1. The influence of various combinations of temperature and humidity on the larval develop-
ment of XY, cheopis. © denotes that about 90%, A about 50 % and A about 33 % of the larvae spun
cocoons; O signifies that about 33 % and m about 10 % of the larvae only reached the naked resting
larval or pupal stage, and +4 most of the larvae died with a little or no growth. Continuous
lines indicate equal development curves (figures near the curves represent the average number of
days in which larvae spun cocoons or completed active larval life).
