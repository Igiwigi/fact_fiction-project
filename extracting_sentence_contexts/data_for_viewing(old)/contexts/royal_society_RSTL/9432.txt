V the interruptedness of the discharge.
A It is probable that there is a fourth way, viz.: by varying the quantity of the

Alischarge, all other things remaining the same. The only phenomenon bearing on
his point at present observed is that when the condenser is allowed to run down, the
Hlischarge-effect appears where previously there had only been repulsion. This might
e supposed to show that decrease of quantity tends to give the discharge-effect, but
Sb is probable that the reverse is the case, and that the phenomenon in _question is due
No the increased interruptedness—the greatly longer period of the intermittence of the
Alischarge—which accompanies the falling of the tension in the condenser, and which,
Ss we have seen, would tend to give the discharge-effect. The importance of slowness
Sf intermittence in giving the discharge-effect is shown by the fact that on working the
*Zeoil with a very high-speed break the sensitive discharge thereby produced only gives
Zrepulsion-effects, while 80 great is the tendency of the coil discharge when a slower
Break is used to give the discharge-effect, that it will often appear in a huminous
Sdischarge when the condenser and coil are used under cireumstances which, from the
Size of the air-spark, would lead us not to expect it, but will yanish when the coil is
zstopped and the condenser allowed to work alone ; thus showing that its appearance
Ewas due to the pulsations of the coil making themselves felt in the discharge, and by
Stheir slowness and violence causing the discharge-effect in places where the more rapid
Sand equable intermittence of the air-spark would not have produced it. No doubt
Esome portion of the above effect is due to the greater violence of the coil pulsations,
Sbut on the whole it tends to support the other experiments which show that the
discharge-effect is intimately connected with great interruptedness of current.
