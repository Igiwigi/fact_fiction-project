The stomach employed for this purpose was under the
most favourable circumstances, as the patient had died of an
apoplexy, having no other bodily complaint. The glands situated in the lining of the lower part of the
cesophagus, which in my former Paper were called cesopha-
geal glands, when examined in the microscope, have the
appearance of infundibular cells, whose depth does not exceed
the» thickness' of the membrane. © This structure, however
different from that of the gastric glands of birds, is a nearer

internal surface of the stomach or duodenum ; it also re-
sembles them in the secretion it produces coagulating milk,
and none of the inspissated juices met with in these cavities
affect milk in the same way. From these facts there can no
longer be any doubt entertained, that the gastric glands have
the same situation respecting the cavity of the stomach as in
birds. In my former investigation, the analogy of the bird would
have led me to the same conclusion, had not the gastric
glands of the beaver, which are more distinct than in any
other quadruped, been a stumbling block in my way; but
now the situation of these glands in the beaver and woombat,
must be considered as an exception to the general rule, the
necessary complexity of their structure making them too
large to admit of their being conveniently placed, as is usual,
in the cesophagus. The structure upon the upper arch of the stomach, which,
when magnified by a common lens, had the appearance of
glands, is shown by Mr.
