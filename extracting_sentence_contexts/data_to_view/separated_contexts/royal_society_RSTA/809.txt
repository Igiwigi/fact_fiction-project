This is indeed the case in the QCT calculations, where
the capture rate, defined as the rate for entering the ionâ€”molecule well, is essentially the same
as the overall reaction rate. In fact, the SIFT rate coefficients reported here are slightly larger
than the parametrized collision rate by Su & Chesnavich [4], which takes into account only the
polarizability and permanent dipole moment of the neutral species. Despite the fact that our PES has the same long-range terms as in Wei et al. [10], our calculated
rate coefficients are much larger than the earlier QCT results. The difference can thus be attributed
to the different level of the ab initio theory. The current CCSD(T)-F12b method is considered as the
gold standard in ab initio calculations because it captures electron correlation due to high-order
excitations that are necessary for describing the dispersion interactions.
