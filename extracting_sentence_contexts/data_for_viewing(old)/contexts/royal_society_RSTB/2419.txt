development of the sorus is like that of the Cyathew, and especially Hemitelia.

But when the sporangium itself is examined the correspondence with Cyathea is
not borne out in detail; a definite regularity of orientation of the sporangia is
certainly suggested by the section shown in fig. 90, but it is not maintained in the
mature sorus, and the sporangia do not show that “ testudo-like” overlapping which
is seen in some Cyathea, and in perfection in the Hymenophyllacez. This is to be
put in relation with the structure of the sporangium itself. The head is still
unequally convex on its two sides, but the annulus is nearly vertical, and runs
directly downwards to the stalk; there it stops short on either side of the
insertion of the head upon the stalk (figs. 91, a, b, ec). Ido not find even that near
relation of the two ends of the annulus to one another, across the stalk which is seen,
for instance, in Dennstaedtia ; in fact, the annulus is of the type characteristic of the
Polypodiacez, while the sorus is characteristic of the Cyathez.

The spores are large, and the number produced from each normal sporangium is, in
O. struthiopteris, between 48 and 64.
