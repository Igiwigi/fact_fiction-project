The differences between the values of the constant a, which represents the coefficient
of cubical expansion for 0°, for the three salts, are small, amounting to only one and
a half per cent.; this is an amount, however, which is five times as great as the
possible experimental error in the deternwnations.

Also that :

The order of progression of the two constants of the cubical coefficient of
expansion is inverted; a, the coefficient at 0°, diminishes with increasing atomic
weight of the metal contained in the salt, while b, half the increment of the
coefficient per degree, increases.

This latter fact leads to an interesting result, namely, that the coefficients, in
increasing with rise of temperature, approach each other in value, until for three
certain temperatures between 110° and 170° they become identical in pairs ; more-
over, in the neighbourhood of the second of these temperatures the three values
approximate so closely to each other that their difference comes within the limits of
experimental error. For temperatures higher than those of coincidence, the values
diverge and exhibit an inverted order of progression. This will be rendered clear by
a table showing the true coefficients of cubical expansion, a + 2bt, for intervals of
50° up to 200°, and for the three temperatures of coincidence. These latter are 114°
for the identity of cubical expansion of potassium and rubidium sulphates, 136° for
potassium and cesium sulphates, and 168° for the coincidence of expansion of the
rubidium and cesium salts.
