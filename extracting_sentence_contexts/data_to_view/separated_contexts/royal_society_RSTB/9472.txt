Yet, when datasets are large, an
amino acid GTR matrix has a better fit than empirical
matrices (e.g. WAG and LG) [40].

(2) Heterogeneity of the substitution rate across sites. Following
the seminal observations of Uzzell & Corbin [41], various
methods have been developed to handle the fact that
some sites are more susceptible than others to accumu-
late substitutions, and thus to generate artefacts. The
gamma distribution appears as a good compromise
between computational efficiency and biological realism. That is why it is now widely used.
