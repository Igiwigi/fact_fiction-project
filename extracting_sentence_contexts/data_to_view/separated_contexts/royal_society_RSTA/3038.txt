Thus, even small sensitivity
improvements are pursued tenaciously. It is obvious from the graphs in figure 7 that phase-quadrature squeezing increases the high-
frequency sensitivity of the gravitational wave detector. Maybe unexpectedly (after the treatment
in §2), it is also evident that the low-frequency sensitivity is not decreased—this is due to the
fact that technical noise still dominates the detector’s sensitivity at low frequencies, masking the
effect of quantum radiation pressure noise (which is thus not visible). It is therefore beneficial for
the overall gravitational wave detector sensitivity to inject phase-quadrature-squeezed light, as
it increases the high-frequency sensitivity, where the interferometer actually is quantum noise-
limited. This will change once the advanced gravitational wave detectors become quantum
radiation pressure noise noise-limited at low frequencies, as their design sensitivity (figure 2)
predicts.
