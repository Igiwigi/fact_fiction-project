Then we have

5< (Qs) —Qj=y.
i=1 i=l


Moreover, because projection is monotone by axiom (A13), we have
6 < 514) AP) sad) < 4,

Thus, y is a truth valuation for K. a

(d) Proposition 6.1
Proof of proposition 6.1. Let x € E(C NC’) = Qenc. We have

1 ifaye€(C\C):(x,y)e SO,

CNC’ .
max_ isic)(x,y) =

is(q) OO = max,

=is(cnc),

_ Jl ifxeS(CNC)
~ 10. otherwise

where the penultimate equality follows from the fact that S is flasque beneath the cover, and
CNC’ CCe™M. With the same argument, we show that iC) =is(cncy, and we conclude

yCnC’_. _.yenc’

which means that K agrees locally. a

(e) Proposition 6.2
Proof of proposition 6.2. We will denote T° := @cejy S(C).

— Suppose K disagrees globally.
