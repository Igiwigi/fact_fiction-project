To 8ee the exact change which had taken place by saponification an ether-alcohol
s0lution was evaporated down and the residue dissolved in absolute alcohol ; a green
solution was thus obtained showing spectrum 13, Chart IT., of which the bands read:
1st, X 669 to A 649; 2nd, X 640 to A 627; 8rd, A 613 to X 593; 4th, uncertain; and
on comparing these measurements with those of the bands of the first absolute alcobol
solution a great discrepancy is apparent. Moreover, the results of saponifying grass
chlorophyll do not exactly coincide with those obtained by saponifying that of Primula,
but even in the case of grass the results are not by any means constant. Whether
this is due to the fact that chlorophyll varies in composition according to season remains
to be proved, but the following observations show that such discrepancies may occur. A solution obtained by digesting grass in ether, to which rectified spirit had
been added, gave a series of bands agreeing closely with those seen in the above
absolute alcohol solution. They read : 18t, A 679-5 to A 640 ; 2nd, A 629 to A 598 ;
3rd, X 591 to A 566; and 4th (about), X 548'5 to A 532, In a thin layer: 5th,
A 486'5 to A 467 ; and 6th, X 451 to x 438.
