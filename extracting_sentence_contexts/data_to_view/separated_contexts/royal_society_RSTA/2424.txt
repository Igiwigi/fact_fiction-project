Without much more accurate data,
however, it would be very unwise to conclude definitely that the phase angle does
not vary harmonically throughout the lunation. According to the theory of the lunar magnetic variations which was outlined in the
Introduction to this paper, they are primarily due to a lunar atmospheric tide, which
produces the electric currents responsible for the magnetic variations. It is a
question of ascertainable fact whether or not the changes in phase angle (with
change of lunar distance) which are found in the lunar magnetic variations are
already present in the lunar atmospheric tide, as revealed by the barometric records. The computations necessary to determine this point have not, however, yet been
made, and therefore in the present discussion it is advisable to consider what
information in the matter may be derived from general theory. In the case of the atmospheric tides, the tidal theory appropriate to a uniform
ocean is presumably applicable.
