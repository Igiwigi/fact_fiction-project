That part of the earth's resolved motion which is in the direction of the visual ray

which has alone to be considered in this investigation, may be obtained from the

lowing formula :
Earth's motion towards star=v. cos A.sin (1—0'),
where v is earth's velocity, 7 the earth's longitude, 7' the star's longitude, and 3. the star's
titude. At the time when the estimate of the amount of alteration of period of the line in
Sirius Was made, the earth was moving from the star with a velocity of about 12 miles
T second.
© There remains unaccounted for a motion of recession from the earth amounting to 29:4
miles per 8econd, which we appear to be entitled to attribute to Sirius. It may be not unnecessary to state that the solar motion in space, if accepted as a
© fact, will not materially affect this result, since, according to M. Orro STRuUvE's calcu-
Z lations, the advance of the sun in space takes place with a velocity but little greater than
2 one-fourth of the earth's motion in its orbit. If the apex of the solar motion be situated
S in Hercules, nearly the whole of it will be from Sirius, and will therefore diminish the
S velocity to be ascribed to that star.
