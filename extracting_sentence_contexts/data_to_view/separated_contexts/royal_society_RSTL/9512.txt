Some
of the orb is pointed at by the contrast between the experiment lasb referred to
those about which we are about to 8peak. The former seems to point to consideraly
equality between the two electricities both as to velocity and rapidity of disehar
The latter will be shown to point to great inequality in rapidity of discharge, Ul
positive having by far the advantage. The difference may probably be accounted
by the fact that in the former case the discharges were of a very gentle character
in a tube of low exhaust, while in the experiments to which we are about to refer
discharges are sufficiently violent to produce phosphorescence. A further question arises here as to the time occupied by molecular 8treams }

+ It is true that the experiment has only been made in tubes of low exhanst, and that it is nob 800:
conelndse that relations which exist in low exhansts between the properties of positive and negative
charges will hold good also in high exhansts.
