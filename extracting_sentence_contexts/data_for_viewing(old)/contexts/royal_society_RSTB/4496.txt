BOTRYTIS CINEREA WITH COLOURLESS SCLEROTIA. 85

doubtful value, for a critical examination of the investigation makes clear that
IstvanrrI has confused two distinct fungi, which possess certain superficial
resemblances, often grow together on the same host, and are not easily separable
in culture.

Recently, SzAvER and Horne (68) claim to have established the relationship of an
unnamed species of Botrytis with a new species of Sclerotinia, which they have
termed S. Geranw. The evidence is very brief, and awaits confirmation, and, in
view of the fact that many “pure-cultures” of fungi are undoubtedly mixed -
populations, that Botrytis cinerea and various species of Sclerotinia and other
genera harmonise perfectly in their growth when developing intermixed, both on
natural hosts and on many artificial media, and that, unless specially searched for,
the very minute microconidia of both forms are easily overlooked, and may act as a
contaminating factor, one may perhaps hesitate to accept unreservedly this evidence.
Furthermore, in my own study, some fifteen thousand cultures of various strains of
Botrytis cinerea and nearly related “species” have been closely observed under the
most varied environmental conditions, and much experimental work has been specially
directed towards the elucidation of the genetic relationships of the fungus. I have,
however, found no evidence indicating that Botrytis cinerea is in any way a
developmental phase within the life-cycle of Sclerotinia Fuckeliana or genetically
related to any other species of this genus. Repeatedly, strains of Botrytis cinerea
