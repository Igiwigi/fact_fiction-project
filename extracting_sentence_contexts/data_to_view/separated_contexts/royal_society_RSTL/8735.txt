powdered rock-salt) ; and it is therefore reasonable to suppose that other 8ubstances may
exist which, whilst they are very different to the eye, may have the same action on dark
radiant heat. We may also fairly assume that a substance may exert a considerable
selection on the rays which it absorbs and reflectsâ€”that, in fact, there may be, in the
ultra-red region of the spectrum, thermic colours, as in the visible spectrum we have
optical colours; 80 that whilst two snbstances may absorb to the same extent heat-rays
of one refrangibility, they may be quite different in their actions on heat-rays of another
refrangibility. These snppositions are not only resonable but yery probable: let us see
how they account for the facts. Light falls on the black and white surfaces of a radio-
meter, or other similar instrument. That which falls on the white surface is nearly all
reflected back again.
