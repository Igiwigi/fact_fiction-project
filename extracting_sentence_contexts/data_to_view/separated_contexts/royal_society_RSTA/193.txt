What is new is that gene
knockouts have revealed how extensive the problem is. Moreover, there is
a possible solution to the problem to which I will return later.

(viii) The existence of stochastic gene expression allows some form of selection
operating at the level of tissues and organs (Laforge et al. 2004; Kaern et al.
2005; Kupiec 2008, 2009). In fact, such selection may be a prerequisite of
successful living systems which can use only those variations that are fit
for purpose. As Kupiec has noted, Darwinian selection could also be very
effective within the individual organism, as well as between organisms.

(ix) Not only is gene expression stochastic, the products of gene expression,
the proteins, each have many interactions (at least dozens) with other
elements in the organism. Proteins are not as highly specific as was once
anticipated.
