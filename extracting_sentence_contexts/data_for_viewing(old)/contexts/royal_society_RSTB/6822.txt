oculation with X”. Three “41956” plants were grafted with President scions containing


206 R. N. SALAMAN ON THE POTATO VIRUS “X”:

XS, and one with X/; there was good union in all cases. The leaflets from the stock
were examined for the presence of the X virus 32 and 54 days after grafting, but no
trace of any X virus strain including X” was found, nor could Bawden obtain any
reaction between the sap expressed from the leaves of these plants and anti-X sera.

It would thus appear that the variety “41956” owes its very real immunity to the Y
virus to some mechanism distinct from that which we have hitherto studied. That such
is not a mechanical one causing difficulty of ingress to the virus is shown by the fact
that simple inoculation, inoculation with carborundum, and grafting, all failed to
bring about infection. One can only assume that the basis of the immunity is of the
kind found in the case of such diseases as Wart disease of the potato (Synchytrium
endobioticum), and that it may be genetic in origin. No evidence for genetic resistance in
the domestic varieties has been observed by the writer, though a claim of this nature is
made for the varieties Katahdin and Chipewa, whose ancestry is fully domestic.
Experiments with the former have failed to demonstrate any immunity to the X
strains.

The seedling 41956 was raised by Dr C. F, Clark and the pedigree is as follows:
