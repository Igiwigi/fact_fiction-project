Our lineage is an especially vivid illustration of these differences;
our lineage is an extreme outlier. But though humans are an outlier, that may
not be a deep feature of our evolutionary history. One notorious and puzzling
fact about hominin evolutionary history is that between about 3.4 Ma and
250 kya, the pace of technological change seems to have been very slow [3]. It increased quite sharply between about 250 kya and 50 kya, and has increased
further since then (very obviously in recent times) [4,5]. The accelerating pace
of hominin cultural evolution seems not to be driven by a matching change in
the biology of humans.
