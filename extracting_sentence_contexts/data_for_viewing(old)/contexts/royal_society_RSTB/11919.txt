turn, and outline a fourth solution—the expendable male
hypothesis—which suggests that men in matrilineal societies
invest relatively little in any children, often direct their energy
elsewhere (e.g. towards mating), and that men’s effort on
behalf of children and households is highly substitutable;
ie. kinswomen can compensate for any deficits in men’s con-
tributions. Table 1 summarizes these hypotheses and several
associated predictions.

Paternity uncertainty represents the oldest and most
common explanation of matrilineal inheritance and coopera-
tive behaviour. Alexander [91] was the first evolutionary
anthropologist to describe what is, in fact, ‘one of the oldest
hypotheses in social science’ [71] in evolutionary terms. The
adage, ‘Mommy’s baby; Daddy’s, maybe’ captures the
source of a fundamental difference between male and
female reproduction in mammals: for mammalian females,
genetic parentage is virtually assured, whereas there is
nearly always room to doubt a male’s parentage. The pater-
nity uncertainty hypothesis posits that, if a male’s
parentage is very insecure, he may do better in terms of
inclusive fitness to invest in his sororal nieces and nephews,
to whom genetic relatedness is relatively secure [8,79,81—
84,91]. The ‘paternity threshold’ [79,83] (the level of paternity
