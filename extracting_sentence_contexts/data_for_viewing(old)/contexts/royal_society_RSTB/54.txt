The coincidence between the results obtained by these two methods is only
explicable, in fact, on the supposition that the aérial micro-organisms are present as
isolated individuals, for, were they present in aggregates, the results yielded by the
flask-method would be in excess; and if the magnitude of the aggregates was great,
in enormous excess of those obtained by Hussr’s method, as in the process of
agitation with the liquid gelatine to which they are subjected in the flask-method,
these aggregates would necessarily become broken up into lesser aggregates, at any
rate, if not into the ultimate individuals of which they are composed.

Hesse, in his well-known paper “Ueber quantitative Bestimmung der in der Luft
enthaltenen Mikroorganismen” (‘ Mittheilungen a, d. Kaiserl. Gesundheitsamte,’
vol. 2, 1884, p. 187), draws the following conclusion with regard to this point :—
“The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed in the tube are moulds
indicates that the mould-germs present in the air are on the average lighter than the
bacterial germs, and leads to the conclusion that the aérial bacteria are not present
as isolated individuals, but as aggregates of individuals or adhering to carriers in
such a manner that on the average they weigh heavier than the mould-germs.” *

* “Tn beiden Réhren sind die iiussersten Colonien Pilzcolonien. Diese... . auffiillig hervortretende
Erscheinung zeigt, dass die in der Luft enthaltenen Pilzkeime durchschnittlich leichter sind als die
Bacterienkeime, und fiihrt zu dem Schlusse, dass die Bacterien nicht als einzelne Individuen isolirt in der
Imft enthalten sind, sondern als Hiinfchen von Individuen, oder an Triigern haftend derart, dass sie
durchschnittlich etwas schwerer wiegen als Pilzsporen.”
