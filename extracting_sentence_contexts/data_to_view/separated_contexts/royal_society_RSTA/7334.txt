If the differences in
the two sets of values of a? were due to it being incorrect to identify the energy parameters
used in the Coulomb approximation with the term values, then the A’s associated with
a given type of transition would exhibit certain characteristics. In particular, they would all
xt be of the same sign and, as functions of n#* , and nj, would be slowly and regularly varying.
& Such behaviour is not followed by the figures in the table. Instead, some are positive and
2 some are negative, and the variation with n*_, and n*¥ is erratic; especially striking is the
§ fact that, while most of the figures are small, an occasional one is abnormally large. A possible
@ interpretation is that there are some numerical mistakes in Hylleraas’s work. The correctness
‘© of this is supported by the ill success of the summation tests he applied.
§ Inspite of the suggested defects in them the results of Hylleraas provide valuable evidence
® that it is a good approximation to equate the energy parameters to the term values.
