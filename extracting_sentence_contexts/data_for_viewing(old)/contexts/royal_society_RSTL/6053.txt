sometimes completely collapsed (see figs. 24 & 25, Plate XXIV.). The grey substance is
at length reduced to a mere border-or fringe (fig. 25), from the edges of which a series
of tapering processes (a, a) extend through the white snbstance to the pia mater at the
surface. The larger kind of cells have entirely disappeared, but a number of small
fusiform cells, or nuclei, resembling those of the connective tissue, are observed in con-
tinuity with fibres which run along it and form arches from one process of the grey
substance to another, as they pass out to the white columns.

question, he would have seen that it was drawn from a section of the conus medullaris, treated only by
acetic acid. The continuity of the gelatinous substance is 80 apparent at this part, both in a fresh state
and when hardened with chromic acid, that STiLL1x6's denial of the fact seems to me unaccountable.


MR. J. L. CLARKE ON THE GREY SUBSTANCE OF THE SPINAL CORD. 455

Of the Epithelium of the Central Canal.

the Ox, the epithelium which lines the central canal consists not only of columnar
lindrical cells—as I first described them *, and as they have since been described
_— observers—but also of cells which are more or less fusiform. Fig. 53, Plate
TI. (a) is an exact representation of some of their forms, magnified 400 diameters.
Tn the columnar variety (the first three on the left of a) the nucleus is large, sometimes
zeroidal, but generally oval, and contains apparently from two to five large, brilliant,
