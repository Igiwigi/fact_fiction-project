In fig. 9, a”, a considerable segment of the vascular medullary cylinder is detached
from the rest, leaving a hiatus in the cylinder, and carrying along with it a semi-
circular loop of the innermost bark, b', with its associated foliar yascular bundles. In my memoir, Part IT., p. 224, I called attention to the fact that the large vascular
bundles s8eparated from the main cylinder to supply the tubercles of the Halone were
given off in the same way, and the bundle a” has doubtless had some similar destina-
tion. Such a division of the primary vascular cylinder differs only in amount from
the dichotomous subdivision of a branch illustrated in fig. 9.
