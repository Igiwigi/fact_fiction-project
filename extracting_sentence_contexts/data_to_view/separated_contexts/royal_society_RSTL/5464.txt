This apparatus also, by splitting up the primary fasciculi, will serve a loco-
motive purpose, and thus enable these animals to reach the cellular intervals between
the muscular fibres, where their further development will be completed. That such is
the effect of the fibres in question is evident on a careful inspection of some of the fas-
ciculi in which these animalcules are contained, in which a separation of the fibrille can
be seen to have been produced by the pointed ends of the entozoon ; these fibrille
having been obviously turned out of their original course, and some directed to one side
and some to the other. This explanation receives confirmation from the fact of those
Cysticerci which are developed in the muscular parietes of the heart being of a different
shape from those formed elsewhere, although their structure in all other respects is
precisely the 8ame. These Cysticerci, in the first or vermicular stage of their develop-
