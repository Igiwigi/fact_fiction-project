The existence of a real time of rest in the
molecular processes of the excitatory state, when these processes pass from nerve-
trunks into nerve-end organs, is not scientifically admissible. The apparent resting time may, perhaps, be considered as time during which
these molecular processes are being transmitted along the excitable tissue very
slowly. The blocking of the excitatory process in cardiac tissue by pressure, &c.,
is acase in point, The Torpedo presents us with a similar phenomenon, and this in
spite of the fact that, once developed, the response of the electrical organ is far the

largest, and therefore the most easily appreciated, vital electromotive change which
has up to this time been examined by the rheotome method. The extraordinary
prolongation of the delay by cold, although apparently connected with the condition
of the nerve endings, may, however, be at least partially accounted for by the
increased time of transmission down the nerve branches contained in the organ itself.
