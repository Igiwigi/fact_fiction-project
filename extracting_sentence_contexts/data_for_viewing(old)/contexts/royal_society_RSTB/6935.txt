Nilssonia incisoserrata seed (Harris 1932), is known from seeds and some rather imperfect
sporophylls of similar size to those of B. gracilis. The cuticular structure of the sporo-
phylls and seeds is almost the same, but the species is well distinguished by the presence
of numerous large masses of resin situated in the flesh and causing bulges in the seed
surface. It is discussed in detail below.


FROM THE JURASSIC ROCKS OF YORKSHIRE 91

A number of isolated seeds have been described (rightly) as seeds of Nilssonia. They
almost certainly belong to Beania, but it would seem best to restrict the name Beania
to sporophylls and cones, giving a different generic name to the seeds. A form genus
for seeds of this general structure has in fact been proposed, Allicospermum (Harris 1935),
or a separate name might be given to Nilssonia seeds, which are further distinguished
as a group by the presence of bulging masses of resin in the flesh, and by some other
peculiarities.

Discussion of the morphology of Beania

Carruthers, and nearly all subsequent authors, regarded the organization of Beania
as being essentially like that of a female cone of Zamia, and this view is here fully
confirmed.

Of the cone axis it merely needs to be said that it agrees with typical stems in bearing
its lateral organs on all sides: the possibility that the Beania cone might be a compound
