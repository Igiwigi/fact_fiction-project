the inverse square law or violations of the universality of free fall. In fact, a growing view is
that G is not truly universal and may depend on matter density on astrophysical scales, for
example. A misunderstanding of the metrology of weak force physics may in turn imply that
the experimental tests that have established the inverse square law and the universality of free
fall thus far are flawed in some subtle fashion. This makes for a potentially exciting situation and
perhaps explains the general interest shown in our apparently mundane and painstaking work
onG.

At the time of Newton and indeed up until the nineteenth century, the concept of a
fundamental constant did not exist. Newton did not express his law of gravitation in a way that
explicitly included a constant G, its presence was implied as if it had a value equal to 1. It was
not until 1873 that Cornu and Bailey explicitly introduced a symbol for the coupling constant in
Newton’s law of gravity, in fact they called it f. It did not take its current designation G until
sometime in the 1890s.

The development of the concept of fundamental constants was intimately linked to the
development of systems of physical units. The international system of units (SI) will be based,
from 2018, on fixed numerical values of seven fundamental constants, including the speed of
light and Planck’s constant, the latter being the constant appearing in the new definition of the
kilogram [5]. Could we not define the kilogram in terms of G? For example, the kilogram is the unit
of mass, its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of G equal to 6.67384... x 10-!! kg! m3 s~?
exactly. In principle, we could do this, but the problem would be that any practical measurement
of the mass of an object in terms of its gravitational attraction to another would have a precision of
