In fact, the proportion of were classified as ‘structure-barrier’ (17%) compared to publi-
species that reproduce both sexually and clonally is similar in cations using microsatellites (70%) and SNPs (62%). Single
the IBO and ‘unclear’ categories (33% for IBO and 35% for gene markers used in early studies seem to contain insufficient
unclear), but higher for IBD (42%). This could reflect the fact information about recent genetic processes as the fit to predic-
that in facultatively sexually reproducing species, biophysical tions from biophysical models was generally poor. This is
dispersal modelling does not catch very local dispersal by expected since differentiation in gene markers generally
clonal reproduction, and is therefore less realistic—at least if reflects processes in deeper time. Genomics and thousands of
sexual reproduction rates are low.
