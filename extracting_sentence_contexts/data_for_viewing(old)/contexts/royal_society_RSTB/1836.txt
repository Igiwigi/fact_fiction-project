It will be a matter of interest later to see how far these characters are absolute
and distinctive. There are, in fact, certain ferns (Gleicheniacese, Osmundaceze, and
Schizzeaceze) which provide important material for comparison, and they show that
the Marattiaceous type is not so isolated among ferns as it is often assumed to be.

Having now seen that, though differing in certain features of the mature sorus, the
four genera of living Marattiaceze conform to one type as regards their development,
and so would appear to constitute a very natural family, we may turn to the consider-
ation of allied fossils. But I shall not attempt to give an exhaustive account of
fossil ferns of presumable Marattiaceous affinity. This would bring with it little
advantage, since so many are merely known by impressions, and the interpretation
of these may often be doubtful. I shall only cite such examples as are reasonably
