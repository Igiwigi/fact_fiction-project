and the arbitrary functions eliminated by differentiation. The differential equations thus formed are of
the first degree in p,, pe, 41, qa, and are not by any means of the general form assumed. ‘The differential
equations in the examples given by Professor KONIGSRERGER are, in fact, linear (see pp. 319, 328). The
method appears to be founded on an interpretation of the last clause of § 2 (p. 290), which is not justified. PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS.
