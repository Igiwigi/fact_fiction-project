It is obvious from what we have already said that the characters of the larval
skeleton in Hchinus are not sufficiently definite to give clear results in hybridization
experiments within this genus. In the end it seems always to remain a matter of
personal opinion which parent the hybrid most resembles in the characters ofâ€™ its
larval skeleton. We have stated the facts above at some considerable length for what
they may be worth, but necessarily there must be a wide difference of opinion as to
their value and significance. In all the hybrids the development of the larval skeleton is much slower than in
the pure-bred forms, and therefore it shows no variation from the rule drawn
attention to in Section 7. Furthermore, with regard to the larval skeleton,
attention might be drawn to another point of some importance.
