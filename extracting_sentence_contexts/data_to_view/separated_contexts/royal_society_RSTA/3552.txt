The variation of U with constant angular momentum leads to results for the
6 determination of the figure identical with those found from the variation of with
= constant angular velocity. But there is this important difference, that to insure
© secular stability 7 must be an absolute minimum. It appears, in fact, that, in the
= case of the pear-shaped figure, while / is actually a maximum for all the deforma-
£ tions but one, it is a minimum for that one, which consists of an ellipsoidal strain of
g the critical Jacobian ellipsoid from which the pear-shaped figures bifurcate (§ 19). & But M. Porncart has adduced another consideration which enables us to determine
% the stability of the pear by means of the function /, without a direct proof that U is
$ a minimum for all variations. For he has shown that if for given angular momentum
a slightly less than that of the critical Jacobian ellipsoid, the only possible figure
© is the Jacobian, and if for slightly greater angular momentum there are two figures
(namely, the Jacobian and the pear*), then exchange of stability between the two
series must occur at the bifurcation.
