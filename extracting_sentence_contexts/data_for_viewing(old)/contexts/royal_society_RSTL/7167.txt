described in the new met, are visible, attached to the under surfaces of the nasal
bones.

The inner surface of the right lateral portion of the ethmoid is marked by obliquely
diverging ridges of bone, with which the plates of the inferior spongy bone were doubt-
less connected. b

By combining the new specimen with this it is easy to ascertain approximatively the
length of the cribriform plate. The former specimen, in fact, is broken through at a
distance of six inches from the anterior end of the snout, but its posterior face does not
exhibit any notable part of the anterior wall of the cranial cavity. 'The same distance
(6 inches), therefore, measured off upon the roof of the type skull, should give the
position of a line beyond which the cribriform plate certainly did not extend anteriorly.
From the point thus defined to the anterior edge of the presphenoid is a distance of
1:75 inch, which must therefore represent the maximum length which the cribriform
plate could have attained. The distance from the anterior edge of the presphenoid to
the level of the posterior margins of the occipital condyles is 4:5 inches. 'The cribriform
plate is rather shorter in proportion to the base of the skull in the Glyptodon than in
> the ordinary Armadillos, and its anterior part is situated far further back in relation to
the antorbital processes.
