It will be seen that in so
doing we have actually introduced what can be regarded as a complete system of
three forces and three couples referred to three axes at right angles. Owing, how-
ever, to the complex nature of the reactions, it appears to us to be essential to
construct our force system in this manner, instead of attempting to analyse a complete
system of three forces and three couples, and assign each component to its proper
causes. In this construction, we have been guided by considerations of symmetry,
the theory of dimensions, the analogy with the theory of the aeroplane, and also, of
course, by the all-important fact that the results of this construction are in
agreement with experiments, so far as these have yet been carried. Of our seven
components by far the most important are R, L and M; then, some way behind, H. Our experiments were designed to determine L and M, and if possible to throw some
light on the size of H, and in these objects a successful start has been made.
