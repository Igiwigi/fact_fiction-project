scientists would, most likely, be willing to assume that one
can only act or speak rationally based on the information in
working memory. This is, however, not sufficient to say
that the two definitions are identical. First of all, working
memory is a theoretical concept described in different ways
(e.g. [9]). Carruthers [8] points out that the first definition
above [1] is dispositional, i.e. that Block here suggests that a
content is A-conscious if it is available (actually or counter-
factually to control systems). Carruthers continues to argue
that the second definition by Block [4] suggests that infor-
mation is A-conscious only in an actual sense, i.e. if it is
received as input by executive and decision-making systems.

Chalmers [7] suggested a different definition of access,
namely that information is A-conscious if the content is
available for a range of different behaviours—especially
voluntary behaviour. This definition lacks some precision
as it does not specify what exactly is meant by a ‘range of
different behaviours’—let alone what is meant by ‘volun-
