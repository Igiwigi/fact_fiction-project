writes the current phylogenetic consensus, in which Eukarya
arise as sisters to or within Archaea. The standard view of
eukaryogenesis as a ‘major transition’, ratcheting up organis-
mal and cellular complexity, also seems to speak against EF
scenarios [4]. Nevertheless, some authors have imagined
such scenarios, often boasting to be the first to have done so.
Our purpose in this section is to recount, without initial critical
comment, several such claims.

(a) Reanney’s genome reduction scenario (1974)

A notably early EF proposal would be Reanney’s [22]. Based on
‘the fact that many stages of evolution appear to have been
accompanied by physical loss of superfluous DNA’, he ‘postu-
lated that the genomes of prokaryotes—where almost every
gene is represented by one copy only—represent the results of
this process carried to its extreme’. Moreover, he mused, ‘certain
features of very early evolution which have been eliminated
from prokaryotes may survive in eukaryotes’ [22].

(b) Woese and Fox’s progenote (1977-1982)

For Carl Woese, a motivating belief was that major structur-
al and functional differences between the translational
