matrix, it is evident that a more refined nature of vacuity is pertinent to the discus-
sion. We have to consider not merely the vanishing of the sum of all the co-axial
minors whose order exceeds a given integer, but rather the vanishing of each separate
co-axial minor, {

It may be remarked that the homographic function V vanishes for the system of
values of «,, #3, 3, which satisfies the equations

§ 6. Digression on the General Theory of Determinants.

Art. 51. The foregoing investigation has established the fact that the co-axial
minors, of a general determinant of Order m, are connected by 2" — n? +n — 2
relations, or in other words, that but n? — n + 1 of them ean assume given values.

Of these relations a certain number are connected in a special manner with the
determinant of Order n, in that they are not relations merely between the coaxial
minors of one of the principal coaxial minors of the determinant.

Let this number be

Ww (),
and put
