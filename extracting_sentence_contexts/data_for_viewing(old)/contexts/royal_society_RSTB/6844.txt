with some basic plagioclase, and iron ore. In the black pseudomorphs original feldspar
inclusions remain unaffected. In the pyroxenic pseudomorphs feldspar inclusions are
often unidentifiable, and may have provided much of the plagioclase.

Green hornblende is generally unaltered in the most glassy rocks. A few crystals
in certain slices of pumice, or of breadcrust bombs, show ‘“‘pyroxenic”’ resorption.
Green hornblendes in pumice never show “black” resorption; those in breadcrust
bombs show it in only one instance, in the form of extremely narrow rims. Green
hornblende showing extensive “black”? resorption was found only in two rocks, non-
glassy intrusions of the nuclei of the Centre and Soufriére Hills.

The “black”’ type of alteration was fully discussed by Washington in 1896. He
stressed the fact that these pseudomorphs are much more common in crystalline than
in glassy rocks, and concluded that the alteration is not due to reaction with the
magma, but takes place when the mineral becomes unstable under conditions of
diminished pressure, and slow cooling from a relatively high temperature (Washington
1896). The rocks of Montserrat provide much evidence in support of this hypothesis.
For instance, in one slice the presence of a narrow rim of unaltered hornblende outside
a “black” core, suggests that the phenomenon is not due to magmatic reaction
(F 4428).

In Japan it has been found that on heating brown hornblende in nitrogen at a
pressure of one atmosphere, to a temperature between 1040 and 1100° C., it dissociates
into a black opaque substance, and expands enormously along the ¢ axis; at 1200° C.
rhombic pyroxene (?) and magnetite were seen in the aggregates (K6zu and Yoshiki
