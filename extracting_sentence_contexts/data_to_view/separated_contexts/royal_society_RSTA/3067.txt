This is due to the widely varying assumptions about population
and economic growth as well as resource efficiency and consumption patterns in the SSPs. On
the lower end marked by the sustainability narrative of SSP1, energy demand stabilizes below
present-day levels in the second half of the century despite an eightfold increase in average global
per capita income. This shows that the mitigation pathway literature includes low-energy-demand
scenarios [10,12,17] independently of the fact that demand-side mitigation measures are less well
represented in IAMs. It can be seen that 1.5Â°C pathways show a transitory drop in energy demand
triggered by the disruptive implementation of strong carbon pricing policies after 2020. For the back-of-the-envelope sensitivity analysis of future final energy demand, we develop
separate projections for future gross domestic product (GDP) growth and energy intensity of
economic activity.
