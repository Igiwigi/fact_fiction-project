A visceral or sympathetic system is also well developed. The supra-asophayeal ganglion (fig. 43) is situated in the extreme anterior region
of the head and measures 1°12 mm. transversely* and 0°6 mm. antero-posteriorly. The protocerebron is extremely well developed, which is remarkable considering the
fact that the eyes are imperfect organs. The protocerebral lobes form the largest
part of the brain and give off the optic nerves. The latter present an unusual feature

* Tn all cases the transverse measurement is the distance between the roots of the two optic nerves.
