in a state of less advanced dissociation ; but if the amount of heat liberated in the
succeeding discharges is more than sufficient to compensate for the loss by radiation,
which must be considerable on account of the high temperature of the vapour, then
the temperature of the vapour will be increased and consequently also the intensity
of some of the lines.

It seems to me that a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena I have observed
may be obtained by considering them as the results simply of variations of tempe-
rature, Of course, it cannot be denied that spectra may be formed by other means
than a pure and simple elevation of temperature, but these methods ultimately
reduce themselves to chemical transformations and thermal changes. This tempe-
rature hypothesis, which accounts in the simplest way for the production of the
spectra, finds considerable support in the fact that the stars give spectra which are
similar in their constitution to those obtained in the laboratory by electrical methods.
It is difficult to imagine any other but a purely thermal cause for the luminosity of
stars.
