of the winds, or their different strengths, or some other differences, were the essential
rectifying element for Chortoicetes. But the form of rectification considered by him and
Williams, in assuming that elements like temperature and humidity effect trend reversals
by inducing the insect to reverse its reactions, places all the responsibility for the trend-
creation on the insect, an unnecessarily complicated hypothesis as to its behaviour. This
theory overlooks the fact that insect-wind relations already provide a basis for trend-creation
and trend-reversal, so that elements like temperature and humidity can have a positive but
indirect trend-creating influence.

EssAYs IN THE INTERPRETATION OF ACTUAL MIGRATION TRENDS

Until continuous observations on behaviour and weather have been made we shall not
know how far the various suggested rectifying processes are in fact responsible for the
migration trends revealed by cartographical methods. Meanwhile, some essays in the
interpretation of actual migration trends will serve to illustrate the suggestions made.

Consider first the trends prevailing during the two main periods of the writer’s observa-
tions, and already tentatively analyzed as far as the wind’s own rectifying action alone is
concerned (pp. 270 and 271). In Iran in spring, 1943, the displacement of the whole swarm
population was northward and north-westward as judged from mapping of the records.
The winds were observed to be predominantly from the same quarter, which is normal
according to Bauer (1935). The most frequently observed direction of flight was against the
