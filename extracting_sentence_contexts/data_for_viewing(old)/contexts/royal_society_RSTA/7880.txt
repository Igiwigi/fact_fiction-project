The true separations of these “D terms are, however, 81-08 and 48-06 respectively,
as may be seen from the well-established multiplets 4p 4P —4d4D at 24300 and
4p 4D us 4d 4D at 24000. Moreover, in addition to the fact that the intensity dis-
tribution in the multiplet is irregular, the lines vv 22171-7, 22123-1 have been satis-
factorily classified elsewhere (see Table Il), so that the proposed classifications for
these must be rejected. The identification of v 22254-1 with 4p 4S). — 4d 4D5/9
has been retained since the agreement between its calculated and observed positions
is within 0-1 cm.1. The absence of the other two components need not appear
surprising since this line is theoretically the strongest of the three but has an observed
intensity of only (00).

The value of the term 4d ?G,).* of S II must be fixed from the multiplet 4p ?F* —
4d*G", since no other combination involving it is known. Its distance in frequency
units from the known term 4d *G,)." at 24487-79 will be given by the interval between
the known line 4p 2F,.* — 4d2G,,.° at vy 24017-91 and an unknown line 4p ?F,).* —
