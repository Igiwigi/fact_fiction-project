S it 8eemed as if the rate of subsidence tended to reach a constant value which remained

S falling off at extreme exhaustions seemed to present a very interesting field of study
S in connexion with the molecular condition of gases. The inquiry would naturally
Z involve the observation of the nearly constant rate obtained at somewhat lower
S exhaustions; and the same apparatus would serve for experiments on the rate of
=Z 8ubsidence at higher densities, up to that corresponding to atmospheric pressure.

£ A comparison of the rates of subsidence in different gases at great but not extreme
SZ exhaustions was further interesting as a new means of determining the ratios of the
L viseosities of different gases. In fact, at high exhaustions the motion of the gas tends
2 to a condition of ideal simplicity from which a comparison of the viscosities of different
S gases would immediately result. The effect of the viscosity of a gas on its own motion
Q 1s regulated by the value of a constant which I have elsewhere* called the index of
friction of the gas, namely, the coefficient of viscosity divided by the density. Accord-
ing to Maxwer's law, the coefficient of viscosity is independent, of the density, and
therefore the index of friction varies inversely as the density. Hence as the exhaus-
tion proceeds the motion of the gas tends to become what it would be if the viscosity
were infinite, and the bounding surfaces had their actual motion. In the limit, the
instantaneous motion of the gas depends only on that of the vibrating plate, to which
It is proportional, except in 80 far as the finiteness of the angle of oscillation entails a
