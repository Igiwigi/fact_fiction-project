A rough
comparison can be made between these records and the data of Smit. Although the records
of the two observers were taken during different years (although at the same place), it may
be presumed that the general trend of population abundance for each species of fly will not
differ so markedly from season to season as to invalidate such a comparison if the whole of
the two-year records are used in each case. This presumption is justified by the fact that, in
both cases, the periods of abundance coincide during both years for all species.

2. Inherent deficiencies in the available records

In several respects, the field records available for the Karroo and other areas lack
essential information. To provide data for the basis of a detailed discussion of field popula-
tions and their relationship to the available carrion, more intensive field work will be
necessary.
