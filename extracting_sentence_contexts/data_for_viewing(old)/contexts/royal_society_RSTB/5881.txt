If we compare the endocranial cast of the Pithecanthropus of Dusois with the
Chimpanzee brain (see Plate 48), there seems to be little doubt that the two frontal
fissures (11 and 7), go distinct in the Chimpanzee, also occur in the Pithecanthropus cast,
which, also in other details of its frontal fissuration, has distinctly chimpanzoid
features*, e.g. in the transverse fissures between 7 and 11, the relation of the fronto-
marginal 9 to 7 and of the fronto-orbital or sub-frontal sulcus (1). Even the small
independent dimple 8 (a very frequent feature even in man) is nearly identical in both.

Moreover, it appears that in Pithecanthropus underneath 7 another fissure (4) occurs
which runs in an archlike way. On the left hemisphere of Pithecanthropus it runs
somewhat steeper still, its course resembling more the relation of fissure 4? in my
Chimpanzee, which may be its primitive homologue, also on account of the fact that
the junction of 4 and 5 (= inferior precentral) in both falls exactly on the temporal
perpendicular} (which covers 5 in the Java ape-man).

Fissure 4 of Pithecanthropus, however, is clearly the homologue of the human inferior
frontal, a statement made by Sir ArrHuR Kerru and by myself, independently of
each other. Dr. NaGreGaat (1929) happened to find a perfectly identical arrange-
ment of the inferior frontal in a microcephalic idiot.

Furthermore it is evident that fissure 7 in this Chimpanzee and in Pithecanthropus is
the homologue of the Neanderthal and recent human midfrontal.

A typical feature of fissure 7 is that in the Chimpanzee and Java ape-man by means
