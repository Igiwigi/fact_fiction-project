holds good.

From what we have said, there is hence no doubt that our formula B = W'/k holds
good for the blood volume of rabbits within the range of our experiments. That is,
as we have said above, that the blood volume of the rabbit is a function of the
surface,

At the same time, it will be seen from our experiments that it is absolutely
unjustifiable to consider the blood volume as a function of the weight of the animal,
since the body weight divided by the blood volume is never a constant for animals of
different weights.

The importance of this is seen from the fact that, while a rabbit of 1340 grammes
contains 5°7 per cent. of blood, that is 1/17°7 of its body weight, a rabbit of
3039 grammes only contains 4°5 per cent. of blood, or 1/22°4 of its body weight.
If, now, one would judge from either of these animals the quantity of blood contained
in the other, the error would be a very considerable one, as it would be calculated
either that the smaller animal contained 60 ¢.c. instead of 76 c.c. (more than
25 per cent. too little), or that the larger animal contained 174 c.c, instead of
136 c.c, (about 22 per cent. too much).

Having now shown that the body weight to the two-third power, divided by the
blood volume, is a constant, it is of interest to see ‘how closely the two methods
which we have employed for the determination of the blood volume agree. In
Table V we have collected together the rabbits in which the blood volume was
