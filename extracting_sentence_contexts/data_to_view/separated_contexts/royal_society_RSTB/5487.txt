with F. species, Ag. 80, corresponding to 18 per cent. of the
sugar fermented. Further indication that these species may be regarded as a separate sub-group
is the fact that while all of them give rise to larger weights of mycelium than the

majority of the other species of Fusariwm investigated, the amount of glucose
metabolized by them is small. The amount of “ volatile neutral compounds ”’ formed by
these five species is also very much less than the average for the remainder, and their
respiration coefficients are very much lower than those of the other species. Another sub-group might be formed of the following species :—F. uncinatum,
Ag. 75; F. trichothecioides, Ag. 73; F. tubercularioides, Ag. 72; F. ceeruleum, Ag. 65;
