where the numerical coefficients &, 5, 53:3, &c. are to be understood as before.
Suppose now that (, y, 2, w) are the coordinates of a point on the curve, through
which point there passes a line through three other points, or line G(m#) ; and that
(#, y/, 2, w') are the current, coordinates of a point on such line: the two equations in e
must have three equal roots; or we must haye a system equivalent to three equations,
or say a plexus of three equations. The coordinates (a, y, 2, &), although four in

- number, are in fact eliminable from this plexus; or what is the same thing, combining
with the plexus the equation
ar+By +72 +dw'=0

of an arbitrary plane, and then eliminating ( y', 2', w'), the result is of the form
(«r+Py+y2+3wYQ =0, |

where [7 is a function of (z, y, 2, w) only ; and considering (#, y, 2, w) as weight variables,
8=Order of Plexus. But degree in (@, y, z, w) of («>+PBy+y2+3w) 0 is =Weight of
Plexus, and therefore Degree of 07 is = Weight of Plexus—0, =(Weight—Order) of
Plexus.

The equations U=0, V=0, DO =0 then give the coordinates (@, y, 2, w) of the points
