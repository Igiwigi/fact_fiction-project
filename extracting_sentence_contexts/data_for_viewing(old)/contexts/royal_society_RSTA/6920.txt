Let a spectrum function W(f) be defined such that fluctuations having frequencies
between fand /+ df contribute [u?] W(/) df to the total value of [v2]. Then W(/) is related
to r, by the transformation

W(f) =4| r,cos2afr dr.
(See, for example, Taylor 1938). *

To apply this equation it is necessary that the correlogram should be extended until
7, approaches the axis of 7. This has been done for two records, 41 4 and 43a, as shown in
figure 4, taking the mean value of r, for the two traces in each case. The points do not
approach the axis asymptotically but appear to oscillate about it, and these oscillations have
been smoothed out in drawing the curves. This is considered a justifiable, and in fact a
necessary, procedure, since the values of 7 are of the order of 1 min and thus an appreciable
fraction of the 10 min length of record. The standard deviation of the errors in 7, is estimated
below to be of the order of 0-15, and the square root of the covariance of near values r, and
7,, of the same order, so that the oscillations appearing are probably spurious.

Each set of points represents the mean from the two meters.
From the curves of r,, W(/) has been computed numerically for records 41.4 and 43a,
and the resulting curves of W(/) against f are shown in figure 5. Both curves show the
largest values of W(/) for the lowest values of /f, Apart from a small peak at f= 0-067 s~!
