Now larve developed under natura
conditions probably rarely, if ever, would have a mean body length less than 32°7¢
for in these artificially developed larvae, with one or two exceptions, the body lengt
only fell beneath this limit when fertilisations were performed in the summer mont
with not thoroughly mature ova. There seems, therefore, to be a considerable |

ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECHINODERM LARVA. 617

this supposition is correct is borne out by the fact that the relative probable
rror of the smallest larvee, which developed under the most unnatural conditions, is
reater than that for the medium sized larve.
___ As the larvee were only measured in sets of fifties, it is not possible to determine
the probable error in each set; but in order to get some idea as to the variability under
erent conditions of environment, the following method was adopted. The average
obable error in each set of measurements was determined by multiplying the mean
body length by ‘061, i.e., the mean relative probable error of all the groups of larvee.
