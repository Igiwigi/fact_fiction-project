This was therefore the
thickness of the film. So much difficulty was experienced in screwing the screws back
that it was determined for the future to use some other method of separating the
gilded plates. During the attempts that were made to get a value of the resistance
of the film, several facts came to light on which our subsequent practice was founded. The first was with respect to the necessity for insulating every part of the appa-
ratus. Our connecting keys proving unfit for such high resistance work, new ones
were made out of rods of ebonite about 20 centims. long, and were so arranged that it
was easy to get at the ebonite in every part for the purpose of scraping it with bits
of broken glassâ€”a very effective way of cleaning it.
