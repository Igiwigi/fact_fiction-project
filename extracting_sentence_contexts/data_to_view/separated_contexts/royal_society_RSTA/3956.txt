This leads to an
evolution of the shape of the interface along the channel (figure 2) and informs a calculation of the
fraction of the cross-sectional area of a channel that is swept by the displacing fluid as a function
of time. On initial consideration, one might infer that, even if the displacing fluid is more viscous,
the interface between the two fluids will become stretched out, as the injected fluid bypasses
much of the original fluid and runs along the most permeable region of the channel. However,
in this work, we demonstrate that a fluidâ€”fluid interface can, in fact, be partially stabilized if the
displacing fluid is sufficiently viscous. We extend the analysis to account for buoyancy effects
in an inclined system, and show that if there is a sufficiently large density contrast between the
fluids then the interface may be stabilized or destabilized by the buoyancy force. In summary, the
model provides a series of idealized solutions for the development of a topographically controlled
viscous finger.
