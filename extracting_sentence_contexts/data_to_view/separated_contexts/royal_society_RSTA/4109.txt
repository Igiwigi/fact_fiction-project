If we thy
do not observe such values under ‘ordinary’ quantum interactions, it may be because they do not [3
exist there, but there is also another possibility which merits consideration: perhaps even a normal : s
quantum value is the sum of several odd quantum values. We are well aware of the extent of speculation in which we are now indulging towards the end
of this work. Not only do we favour the highly unorthodox account of time-symmetric quantum
causality, but we are willing to ascribe it exchanges of negative momentum and mass to account
for the fact that, despite its spatial and temporal oddities, the quantum interaction does obey
conservation laws.

5. From information to ontology

How, then, can non-events play a part in the quantum process? The challenge’s acuity is reflected
in the various radical moves it has elicited from the rival interpretations of QM.
