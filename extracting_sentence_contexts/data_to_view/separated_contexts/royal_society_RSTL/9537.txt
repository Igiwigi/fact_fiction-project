Since I propose to discuss in a later paper
a the whole question of the formation of pre-products by gland-cells, I will here only
S briefly mention the main facts which show that zymogen and not ferment is stored up
& by the glands we are considering.
= Tf the cesophagus or stomach of a Frog be placed in glycerine as rapidly as possible
© after removal from the body, the glycerine extract has only a weak peptic power. S If the eesophagus or stomach of a Frog be kept moist for twenty-four hours before
S it is placed in glycerine, the glycerine extract has a very much greater peptic power.
= Tf the cesophagus and stomach which has been extracted with, say, 5 cub. centims. of
2 glycerine for a week be washed free of glycerine and treated with 5 cub. centims. of
S dilute hydrochloric acid, then an enormously greater amount of pepsin is found in the
S acid than is found in the glycerine extract.

&= The glycerine extracts increase somewhat, although only slightly, in peptic power
S when treated with dilute acid for twenty-four hours.

© BSince in testing a glycerine extract for pepsin, hydrochloric acid is added, it is possible that eyen the
= 8mall amount of pepsin found in it may arise from the splitting up by the acid of combined pepsin. EZ Thexe facts, I think, show that both the cesophageal and gastric glands form zymogen
which under certain conditions, and particularly when acted on by dilute acids, give
S rise to pepsin, The zymogen is only slightly soluble in glycerine. S Similar observations made on the gastric glands of Triton teniatrs give similar
S reults. Tn the Snake, lack of animals has prevented me from comparing the pepsin-
A content of glycerine extract of the fresh with glycerine extract of the exposed stomach,
but the experiment mentioned above (p. 694) shows that the gastric glands of the
Snake als contain zymogen.
