The question, however, was too interesting to be leſt
in any degree of uncertainty ; and I have, therefore, made
several fresh experiments with the view to its decision. In
the course of these I have found, that though differences in
the results are produced by causes apparently trivial, some
of which I shall afterwards point out, yet that under equal
circumstances, precisely the same relative proportion of hy-
drogene gas is obtained from muriatic acid gas, whether ex-
posed or not to muriate of lime ; and that its greatest amount
* does not exceed 7; or - the original volume of the acid gas. In the paper last quoted, 7 I have also described an experi-
ment, in which sensible heat was evolved by bringing muriate
of lime into contact with muriatic acid gas; a fact which, if
established, would go far to prove the existence of water in
that gas. But on repeating the experiment with muriate of
lime recently cooled from fusion, and over mercury carefully
deprived of all moisture by boiling, I was not able to discover
any increase of temperature, though a very sensible air ther-
mometer was inclosed in the vessel containing the gas. The
evolution of heat takes place, only when the muriate of lime
