Bar synangium was seen (fig. 156), the position of the three loculi being similar
(Se in Psilotwm, with which the correspondence of the whole sporangiophore is
Bt exceptional cases very close. Fig. 157 represents a less regular case where
sdoculi are seated on one sporangiophore.
We the greatest interest in connection with the hypothesis above put forward is
@l in those abnormal synangia which show simplification of external form, and it
Jebsently be shown that simplification of internal structure follows that of form :
mpler synangia are most frequently, though not exclusively, found at the limits
fertile zone, or on specimens which have developed weakly. The most frequent
eation is found in the absence of the groove separating the two lobes of the
ium, so that externally the synangium appears as a single boat-shaped body
8). In others the form may be shorter (fig. 159), but in such specimens, of which
rnal structure will be seen to present facts of the greatest importance for our
, it is to be noted that the two projecting points, as well as the slight median
, show that the whole body represents a complete synangium of a reduced type ;
t to be ascribed to the arrest of one or other of the loculi, asin figs. 150 or 151.
, in fig. 160, we see an extreme case of reduction, the synangium being
egal by a small spherical body, borne in the usual position on a
wangiophore, of which the leaf-lobes are of a very small size. The above examples
ll show the chief lines of modification of form to which the synangia are liable ;
more direct interest in connection with our hypothesis is to be found in
difications of internal structure and development which accompany them.
e normal structure of the synangium and its development have been described in
We (p. 541-543); examination of sections of such syuangia as those we have
discussing shows considerable deviations from the normal structure, especially
