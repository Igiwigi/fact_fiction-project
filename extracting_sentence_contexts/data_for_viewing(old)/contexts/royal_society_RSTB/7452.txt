(iii) Larvae of C. marginalis reach the beginning of their period of most rapid growth
some 10 hr. later than do those of C. chloropyga. They are therefore less able to compete with
the more rapidly growing Lucilia larvae than are the maggots of C. chloropyga, since they will
be faced with an even greater shortage of food towards the end of their developmental

period.


ALLIED PHENOMENA IN SHEEP-BLOWFLY POPULATIONS 141

The differences in the mortality of Lucilia larvae in the two cases cited may be ascribed
to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly superior to C. marginalis in its adaptation to the
situation. A greater proportion of the food supply is consumed by the C. chloropyga popula-
tion before Lucilia has completed its most rapid growth period and therefore less is available
to the latter species.

(6) With Chrysomyia chloropyga

In its reaction to the amount of food available, C. marginalis is most closely related
to C. chloropyga. Its percentage mortality under conditions of intraspecific competition
approached that sustained by populations of the latter species, so that in mixed populations
it might be expected that something in the nature of straightforward competition for food
will take place with results very similar to those obtained in Lucilia-C. chloropyga mixed
populations. That this is not altogether realized is shown in the data for the available series
