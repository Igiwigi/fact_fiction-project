(i) Prosodic constituent structure
Along with other findings from segmental phonology [12]
and intonational phonology [20], these findings suggest that
a structure that is influenced by syntax, but not isomorphic
to it, directly defines the groupings observed in speech.
This structure, called prosodic constituent structure, is hier-
archical, and includes constituents such as words and
perhaps feet or syllables at lower levels, and phrases of
various sizes at higher levels. Although there are debates
about many aspects of the prosodic hierarchy, e.g. about
the number of levels in the hierarchy, and about the name
and definition of each constituent type, there is general agree-
ment about its hierarchical nature, and about the fact that it is
flatter and more symmetric than syntactic structure [12,21].
An example of prosodic structure is shown in figure 2.
Prosodic constituent structure is a likely linguistic univer-
sal, although different languages may elect different sets of
levels from the universal hierarchy [22]. It has measurable
