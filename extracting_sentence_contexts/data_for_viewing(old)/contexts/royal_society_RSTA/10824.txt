* Radiation of this kind would give rise to definite lines in the spectrum of a frequency which might,
and probably would, be very different from the frequencies of the light vibrations given out by the
internal vibrations of the atoms. In this connection it is of interest to remember that experiments with
Mertzian vibrators have demonstrated the existence, in certain substances, of free periods of which the
frequency is only about 1/1,000,000th of the frequency of the sodium lines. (P. Drupr, ‘ Wied, a

any way corresponds to the facts, the molecules of these gases must possess a

Sin Part I., what sort of results are to be expected, it now becomes possible to examine
the case in which the. molecules form a more complex dynamical system, and as this
