The steady magnetic force and couple thus obtained may be provisionally
msidered as derived from an energy function (kinetic) Aw + BB + Cy per unit
plume, in which (A, B, ©) is unvaried (cf Maxwetn, “ Treatise,” § 639); the
” ular part of the molecular foreive may be considered as involving an internal
nergy function 27 (A® + B® + C*) in which (A, B, C) is varied. More fundamentally, if we divide (a, 8, y) into a part (#’, B’, y’) due to the magnet
self and a part (a), By, yo) due to the inducing field, the actual energy associated
ith magnetic force is

4 (Aa’ + BB’ + Cy’) + Aa, + BB, + Cy,

which (A, B, ©) is now to be varied; and this, when there is no permanent
etism, leads to the same mechanical forcive as an energy function §«(a°-+ B’+y°),
here « is the coefficient of magnetization, the part of it not thus compensated being
nected with the internal work of orientation of the molecules. This energy
ction is not the whole kinetic energy of the wether: that would be in the present
jnits the space-integral of (a? + b? + c*)/8m together with a molecular part, that is
he space-integral of (a« + bB + cy)/8a + 4 (a? + B+ y°), of which the latter
trm is exactly compensated by the above mechanical forces acting on the magnetized
pily, while the other term which remains over goes to produce electrodynamic effects,
Bnd in part to represent intrinsic energy of magnetization, and is in fact the electro-
By hamic energy formulated in Maxwetu’s scheme. Tt is to be remarked that the magnetic vector potential, obtained in the previous
eras the vector potential of the Amperean currents in the form

F = |(Bd/dz — Cd/dy)r~'dr,

mplies that- the orbital velocities of the electrons do not approximate very closely
0 the velocity of radiation, a condition which in reality is sutticiently satisfied :
Sf that were not so, this expression would require correction for an wthereal dis-
acement part of the molecular current.

A, B, C, in case there are currents flowing in the magnet; so that in this
onnection it is not permissible to treat the magnetization as a vector and resolve it
ito components.
