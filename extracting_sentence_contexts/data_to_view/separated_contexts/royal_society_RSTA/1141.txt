Before comparing the stability domains obtained for all collision models of interest, the impact
of the parameter M has been investigated. Results obtained for the most sensitive collision model
(which was identified as the BGK operator) are plotted for different mesh sizes in figure 8. At first
glance, the fact that the stability of LBMs depends on the number of iterations (required to run the
simulation) might be surprising. Nonetheless, one must remember that in the context of LSA, even
if a wave is proven to lead to a linear instability, it will take some time before it emerges from the
uniform background of the flow. Especially, if its growth rate is extremely low, let us say Im(w) =
10-5, then its amplitude would be increased by a factor exp[Im(w)] 1 + 10-5 at each iteration.
