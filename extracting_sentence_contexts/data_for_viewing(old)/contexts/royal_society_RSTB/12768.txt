anisms is essential for collective migration, ensuring the neural
crest is maintained as a loosely connected migratory group,
which behaves in a fluid-like manner [85]. When the attraction
is too strong, the group fails to move; when repulsion is too
strong, the cells disperse away from each other, and migration
becomes individualistic rather than collective [11,38,86].

Finally, cell tracking and particle image velocimetry has
revealed that there is alignment of motion during collective
neural crest migration, with neighbouring cells tending to
move in the same direction at a similar speed (figure 4c)
[41,42]. The mechanisms governing aligned cell movement
are unclear, but likely involve space limitations and the fact
that cells are adhered to one another. Also, N-cadherin-
dependent adhesion junctions form between colliding cells,
meaning that through physical attachment, cell movement
is aligned until the repulsion stage is reached [79]. This is
further supported by theoretical and experimental evidence,
which shows that the emergence of persistently polarized col-
lective cell movements when they are under confinement can
arise from CIL between colliding cells [59]. Dictyostelium cell
