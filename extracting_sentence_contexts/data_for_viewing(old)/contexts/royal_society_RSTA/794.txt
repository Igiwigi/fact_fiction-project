There is a long-known set with explicit expressions generated by standard methods, and then a
new set of ‘quasi-local’ conservation laws found starting from work of Prosen [43]. This second set
turns out to underlie spin currents and explain the observation in the gapless phase of non-zero
Drude weight [44] using numerical density-matrix renormalization group time evolution, which
is quite powerful for XXZ. The complexity of XXZ charges places a premium on methods that do
not require explicit expressions for the conserved quantities and their continuity equations.

However, there is one useful and nearly unique property of the XXZ conserved quantities.
The local energy current jg is itself a conserved density (i.e. the local current density integrates
over space to a conserved quantity or ‘charge’). Even though the XXZ model is certainly not
Lorentz invariant, this is similar to the property that, in Lorentz-invariant theories, energy flux =
divided by c? is equal to momentum density. With interactions, the problem of two reservoirs is : 3
much more complicated than in the free case. The fact that energy current is itself a charge in a
continuity equation allows one to derive several exact far-from-equilibrium results for integrals mea)
of the energy current distribution in space :

for the two-reservoir quench [45], which also explain some previously noted identities for : 5s
XXZ [46]. The more general hydrodynamical methods described in a moment can calculate the :
full spatial distribution but are limited to long-time, long-distance behaviour.

We now return to the general properties of conserved charges in integrable and non-integrable
