Morphology and phylogeny of the head in Onychophora and Arthropoda

It is not proposed to give a complete review of this vexed subject. Certain principles will
be considered, and the bearing of the present work on some recent theories will be given.

Much has been written concerning the segmentation of the head and body in Arthropoda
based on the numbers and positions of embryonic mesodermal somites. Much unnecessary
confusion has resulted from a lack of appreciation of data drawn from all arthropodan
groups, and from a disregard of the following three points:

(1) The boundaries of an embryonic somite in most parts of the body are obvious, but
where two coelomic sacs are found either connected together or even separate from each other,
this fact alone forms no conclusive evidence for the view that the two sacs represent somites
of two adjacent segments. The possible fallacy of considering the ‘labral’ and ‘ pre-antennal’
coelomic sacs seen in a certain stage of the stick insect Carausius, as separate segmental
entities was pointed out in 1928. A single somite normally divides into two parts in this
region, the precheliceral of the spider (Kishinouye 1893), the pre-antennulary in the
Malacostraca (Manton and Nair), and the antennal in Koperipatus (Evans 1901), but this
functional division is no evidence that two segments are involved, a view with which Tiegs
(1940) is in agreement. Where organ formation from somite walls is precocious, as in many
insects, it would be a small step for two functional parts of a somite to separate partially or
completely at an early stage, even before any coelomic space had appeared. But this would
provide no evidence for the existence of two originally separate segments.

(2) There are examples of united somites which do represent more than one segment, but
