ROBERTS-AUSTEN ON THE DIFFUSION OF METALS. 413

Welding of Gold and Lead, and Diffusion of Gold in Lead at the Ordinary

Temperature. The fact that two clean surfaces of lead will weld together at the ordinary tem-
perature is well known. It may be well, however, to state in connection with the
experiments of Demargay (see p. 408) on the volatilization of metals in vacuo at
comparatively low temperatures that if the ends of small bars of gold or silver be
surfaced, pressed against lead, and maintained for four days in vacuo at a temperature
of only 40Â°, the interpenetration of the two metals will be so complete that their
separation can only be effected by the mmementhen of a load of 70 Ibs. per square inch
iy the sectional area of the bars, or no less than } of the breaking strain of lead.
