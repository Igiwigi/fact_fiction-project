cies of Chelonians ; for either they grow in such a way, the one in front of the other,
that they meet by their corresponding borders in their whole length, s0 as to consti-
tute a continuous plastron, or their growth is more restrieted, and then they form a
plastron open in the middle; or they constitute merely a narrow ring, as is probably
the case in the Sphargis*,‚Äù

He alludes to other modifications of growth, which might equally have been sng-
gested by the known varieties of the plastron in the adults of the different genera and
species of Chelonia ; e.g. where it extends forwards beyond the neck, and backwards
beyond the tail, which he thinks may probably depend upon the presence of an infe-
rior fold of chorion existing in front of the fore-feet, and of another inferior fold be-
hind the hind-feet : although he admits that where, as in the Trionyz, such folds
occur, they are not occupied by the plastron, which fact invalidates the hypothesis.

My observations do not agree with those of RaTaks, which have led him to ascribe
the eight parial pieces of the plastron to the development of as numerous os8eous
pieces in the two pairs of primitive slender cartilages. I find no other ossification
set up on the anterior pair of those cartilages than that which results in the forma-
tion of the hyosternals ; and no other in the posterior pair than that which results in
the formation of the hyposternals. The episternals unquestionably have independent
cartilages, and 80 I believe have the xiphisternals, though I have failed to get 80
clear a demonstration of the latter,

'The primitive cartilages of the true sternum (entosternal) and the thoracic-abdo-
minal hamapophyses (hyosternals and hyposternals) are distinct from, and deeper-
