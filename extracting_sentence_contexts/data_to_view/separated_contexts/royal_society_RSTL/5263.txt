A. CAYLEY'S INTRODUCTORY MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 255

gives rise to a fresh series of results. We have in this case

{yd.} =0,+d;..

{xd,} =—(«+Þ..)ad,+4,+8Dg+..;
in fact, with these meanings of the symbols the quantic is reduced to zero by each
of the operations {xd,}—a®,, {y/,}—y®,, and we have consequently the definition of
the covariant of a quantic considered as expressed in the form a(z—cy)(zx—By).. And it will be remembered that these and the former values of the symbols {x9,} and
{y9,} are, when the same quantic is considered as represented under the two forms
(a, b, .b, a'Yz, y)" and a(x—ey)(x—PBy).., identical.

19. Consider now the expression
a(x—ayY(v—Py)*..(a—PBY...),

where the sum of the indices, p... of all the simple factors which contain «, the sum
of the indices k, p... of all the simple factors which contain Þ, &e. are respectively
equal to the index 0 of the coefficient a.
