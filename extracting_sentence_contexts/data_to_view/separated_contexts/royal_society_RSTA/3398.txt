evolve the star back to the blue, and so the lifetime is sensitive to the mass-loss rate. Of course,
close binary evolution would do the same job, and so can substantially shorten the RSG lifetime
of stars of any initial mass. In fact, for a population of stars in binaries with a distribution of mass
ratios and separations, it has been argued that the average RSG lifetime may be a factor of 2-3
shorter [13].

3. Temperatures

As mentioned in the previous section, as He burning begins the stars will swell up until
they reach the Hayashi limit—the maximum stable radius for a convective star. It is,
therefore, worth discussing what this temperature is, what determines it and how theory and
observation compare.
