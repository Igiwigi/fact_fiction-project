It is important to notice that the value of d in this experiment, obtained from the
two flows, is more in agreement with the mean value of d for the other ice experi-
ments, obtained by extrapolating from the values of 4 in Series VI. than for the
values obtained by eliminating the heat-loss in the usual way. This points to the
fact that the values given above are more nearly correct than the values given in the
tables for the same experiments. If this be so, the indication is, that the value of the
specific heat of water rapidly approaches an exceedingly high value at 0Â°, and in a
remarkable way substantiates the suggestions made by Rowianp in his memoir in
regard to this. Further investigation is needed, however, in the neighbourhood of
the freezing-point of water, before we can say that the specific heat of water
approaches an infinite value as that point is reached.
