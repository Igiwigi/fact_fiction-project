The Proton Prediction : =
System (PPS), developed at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), uses signatures of solar :3
flares such as the SXR intensity and location, a fixed time parameter (0.25h after the flare’s iad

onset) for the injection of particles into the IP medium and a time-invariant longitudinal SEP
intensity gradient of a factor of ~10/radian from the position of the parent solar flare [94,95]. This
gradient attenuates the maximum particle intensity as the angular distance from the site of the
flare increases [94]. Recent multi-spacecraft studies verified the fact that the largest SEP intensities
are observed from spacecraft that are well connected to the parent solar event and that there is a
longitudinal gradient that on average falls in approximately 45° [79,96]. PPS provides predictions
of the probability of SEP occurrence, as well as time-intensity profiles of SEPs observed at 1 AU for
a number of user adjustable energy ranges [95,97]. Based on the association of properties of hard
and soft X-ray flares with subsequent SEP events, concepts that use either the relation between
gradual hard X-ray flares and SEP events [98] or the ratio of the soft X-ray fluxes of the two X-ray
wavebands in solar flare events, which yield the flare plasma temperature and emission measure,
assuming a single temperature source [89,99], have been proposed [100].
