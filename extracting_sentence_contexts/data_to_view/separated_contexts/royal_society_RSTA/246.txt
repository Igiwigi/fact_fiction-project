Enunciating an ideal process is one thing. Embedding it as standard operating
procedure is another. Eloquent testimony to this sad fact is provided by the recent
episode of Professor Nutt’s dismissal from the Chair of the Advisory Committee
on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). Indeed, given the apparent need to reincarnate
such protocols for science advice in policy making at regular intervals, I suspect
similar rules were enunciated prior to 1996 and that I am guilty of being unaware
of them! Quite apart from this ‘embedding’ issue, there are other major problems in
implementing such guidelines for good practice.
