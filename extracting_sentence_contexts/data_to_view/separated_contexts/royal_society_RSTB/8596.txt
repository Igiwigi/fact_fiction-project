Ecosystem regime shifts and states also impact other biologi-
cal parameters, such as growth. Unlike recruitment time series,
there are probably several size-at-age time series that are long
enough to span at least one regime shift and state. In fact, several
stock assessments now include time-varying growth [42-44]. Expanding time-varying growth to include environmental for-
cing could include regime-shift impacts since size-at-age can
dramatically change from one regime state to another [45]. How-
ever, environmental forcing of growth or other biological
parameters will result from indirect impacts (e.g. prey avail-
ability) and direct impacts (i.e. physiological impacts such as
mortality) which can have confounding consequences.
