This may be considerably
increased by the presence of follicular cells as the egg enters the tube, or by the addition
of albumen as it passes through that structure. If, however, a circle of the minimum
size of the egg is drawn to scale on a camera outline of a transverse section of the tube
(fig. 7), it will be evident at once that the egg cannot pass through the tube without
pressing the tubal folds slightly away from one another, a process that will bring the
surface of the egg into such intimate contact with the cilia of the tube as to place these
bodies in a most advantageous position for communicating motion to the egg. In
fact, the tube possesses a structure which in form and proportions is most admirably
adapted to the propulsion of the egg by cilia. It is a common experience of those who have worked much with cilia, that when these
effectors are being tested at about the limit of their capacity, a small amount of extraneous
motion, like a slight vibration, will enable them to continue to transport an object which
otherwise might come to a standstill. Such slight movements disengage the moving
object from momentary hindrances and thus facilitate its transportation.
