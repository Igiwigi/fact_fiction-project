At the end of an experiment in which the tube was originally full of a strong
“Zchloride jelly, the author has frequently melted out the yellow part (without dis-
Sturbing the blue, which consists of CuCl,), and tested it for chlorine without finding
Bore than, at most, a barely perceptible trace. After one experiment with KCI, in
‘Swhich a wide tube was employed, so that the quantities were considerable, only a
doubtful trace of potassium could be found in the blue part, after separation of the
Seopper by H.S, evaporation with sulphuric acid, and ignition to destroy organic
} matter. = Less direct, but no less striking, evidence to the same effect is afforded by the fact,
gestablished by preliminary experiments, that the ratio of velocities of the blue and
& yellow boundaries is practically the same in different experiments with the same
BS concentration of the same salt, no matter how the dimensions of the tube be
Svaried. There is also the fact, already stated, that this ratio in any one experiment
remains practically constant from first to last. Very slight variations, it is true, do
A occur, attributable most probably to the presence of impurities in the gelatine or in
the salts employed, or to slight heating by the current in spite of the constant
temperature bath.
