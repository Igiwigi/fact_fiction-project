tion of their fibres. In doing this, they not only admitted of
Separation to the edge of the cornea, but brought away a lamina
of the cornea with them. I thought this would be better seen

. in an eye after putrefaction had begun to take place, but found
that in that tate it could scarcely be demonstrated ; while
in the recent eye the whole of the external lamina of the cornea
could be brought away along with the four straight muscles,
leaving the surface underneath uniform, but without polish,
and upon the same plane with the sclerotic coat, of which it
was a continuation. I '

As this was a new fact, and a very important one, shewing a
connection between these muscles and the cornea, I have dried
the parts, and preserved them in that state, to shew the mode
in which the tendons of the straight muscles are lost in the
cornea, giving it the appearance of a central tendon.

The cornea from this investigation is proved to be com-
posed of two lamine, the external a continuation of the ten-
dons of the four straight muscles, the other a continuation of
the sclerotic coat, and the uniting medium between them is
not unlike very fine cellular membrane.
