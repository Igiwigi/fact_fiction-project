Natural History may be considered in two very different lights: either, 1st, as a collection 2 |
of facts and objects presented by nature, from the examination, analysis, and combination

of which we acquire whatever knowledge we are capable of attaining both of the order of
nature, and of the agents she employs for producing her ends, and from which, therefore,
all sciences arise; or, 2dly, as an assemblage of phenomena to be explained; of effects to be
deduced from causes; and of materials prepared to our hands, for the application of our
principles to useful purposes. Natural history, therefore, considered in the one or the other
of these points of view, is either the beginning or the end of physical science. [1]
