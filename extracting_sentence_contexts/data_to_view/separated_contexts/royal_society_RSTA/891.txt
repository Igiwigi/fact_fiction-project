Furthermore, let us denote the projectors iG

pO = pZ) and pO = pZ)

in the Z basis as . The post-measurement state is then given by

IWpot) = 2" EPID «++ PES PRP IG). (Al)
By acting with the projectors on |G), we find by induction on n — k that the post-measurement

state can be evaluated to

n-k n-k
Ivo) =| QZ x, Pee | | TT Zino. vip" J iciv’y J, (A2)

where adj(u, v) is 1 if (u,v) is an edge in G and zero otherwise and where Z[X] is [],ex Zx- One
can see this by checking that indeed

2P AS? post |) = Wipost), (A3)

by using equations (2.15) and (2.19). The operations on the qubits in V(G)\V’ in the left part of
equation (A 2) will only give a global phase as follows:

n-k n—-k

The exponent in the global phase }); k Die 1 xixjadj(v;, vj) is in fact the number of edges in the

induced graph G,; = G[{v; : x; = 1}]. Let us now consider the correction operators in the right part
of equation (A 2). A qubit v € V’ will have a Z contribution from the ith factor if v € Ny, and xj =1.

1We identify 0 and 1 with the measurement outcomes +1 and —1, respectively.
