If, as in the case of P and Hg, we try to verify this value by a comparison with
the indices of compounds of sulphur and of its refraction equivalent, we are met by
anomalies which show that no single value of the refractivity of sulphur will satisfy
all cases. Table X. gives the indices and refractivities of the compounds of sulphur, the
refractivities of all of whose constituents are known. It will be seen that the
refractivities which must be assigned to 8, in order to satisfy the additive law,
vary widely from the value of 551 here given for 8, In SO,, H,8, SO,Cl.,, and
notably in H,SO, and SO,HCI, a smaller value would best accord with the facts. In
SOCI,, PSCl,, P,S, the value 551 would fit in excellently. In SCl., 8,Cl, a value
slightly larger, and in CS,, whose refractivity is 1476, a much larger value is
required ; for the highest contribution we can expect from C. is 250, which would
leave 610 to be accounted for by each of the sulphur atoms.
