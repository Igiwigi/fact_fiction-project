As a result of restrictions on publication then in force, priority of discovery appears to
be somewhat in doubt (see, however, Garner e¢ al. 1950). It is possible, too, that such effects
have been familiar in certain industries for a considerable time. In view of these facts it
appears desirable to describe them by a title which is as non-controversial as possible. Accordingly, in this paper the term ‘normal stress effects’ will be used. This is equally
applicable on the basis of all the theories for the description and origin of the effects which
have so far been advanced, with the exception of that of Garner etal. (1950).
