272 MR. W. SPOTTISWOODE ON THE CONTACT OF SURFACES.

if the contact be triaxal it will be snperficial. But we may take for two of the axes of
triaxal contact the tangents to the two branches of the curve of intersection through P ;
and for every position of the cutting plane about each of these axes the contact will be
three-pointic, viz. two consecutive points of the branch to which the axis is a tangent
and one point of the other branch will lie in the plane; whence it follows that, reckoning
only arbitrary axes as before, if three-pointic contact be uniaxal it will be snperficial.
And this method has application to all degrees of contact.

The equations (48) would apparently determine two axes about which three-pointic
contact would be cireumaxal ; but that this is not the case will appear from the actual
solution of one of them. In fact the solution of the third equation depends upon'the
quantity (3,3,V)*—#V#V, in order to develop which we have the following values —
