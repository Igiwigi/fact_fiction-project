It was found that for the same conditions of radial distance of the holes and separation of
disk from beaker the pressures measured in the solutions were independent of the direction
of measurement. The pressures were therefore as envisaged—isotropic pressures. (2) The theory is based on the hypothesis that the pressure generated is due to the
difference in the shear-energy input at two points and not to the mere fact that there is shear. Thus ifa surface has uniform shear on it there should be no excess pressure generated at any
point compared with any other. This can be tested in several ways: (a) In a Couette-type
viscometer the inner static cylinder when ¢otally immersed experiences uniform shear at all
points sufficiently removed from the edges.
