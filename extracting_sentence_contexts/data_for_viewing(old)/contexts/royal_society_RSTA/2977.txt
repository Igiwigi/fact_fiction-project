not by the instrument's instantaneous field of view. Furthermore, the location in the ring probed
by an occultation is determined by the position of the spacecraft relative to the rings and the star,
and is insensitive to the precise orientation of the spacecraft. This allows the geometry of each
occultation to be determined to very high accuracy, enabling data from different occultations to
be combined together effectively.

The analysis of UVIS occultations employed the ‘weighted wavelet Z’ technique [23].
A wavelet transform was performed on each individual occultation, and then the wavelet
scalograms (equation (3.10)) were co-added together with a weighting based on the quality
of each profile in terms of resolution and/or signal to noise. This ‘is equivalent to summing
probabilities, which is the best way to treat datasets of different qualities (as opposed to adding
raw power)’ [21]. The benefits of this approach are illustrated in figure 14, which shows the
detection of two faint SDWs in the C ring despite the fact that neither can be seen by eye in


radius (1000 km)

Figure 13. Radial scan and two wavelet transforms from Cassini image N1467346329 (figure 12), showing wakes excited by
Pan along with several density waves. (a) The wavelet plot, like all others in this paper, uses a central frequency a) = 6;
(6) uses a = 12, resulting in increased resolution in the spectral (y)-dimension at the expense of smearing in the radial
(x)-dimension (see §3c). Density waves are clearer in (a), including the strong Pandora 11:10 and Prometheus 15:14 waves, but
also the weak third-order Janus 1714. Dashed lines indicate model density wave traces, assuming a background surface density
0 = 40g cm~?. Moonlet wakes excited by Pan are clearer in (b). The three dotted lines denote the frequency profiles [7] of
wakes that have travelled 342°, 702° or 1062° in synodic longitude since their last encounters with Pan. Figure from Tiscareno
