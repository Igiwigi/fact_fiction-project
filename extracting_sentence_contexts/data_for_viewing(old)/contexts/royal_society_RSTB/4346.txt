electrodes are moved from the A-V groove (at 3) downwards towards the apex of
the heart, the change in form and in magnitude is very slight until the trabeculated
region is passed. As the descending branch of the left coronary artery is crossed
there is an abrupt change in type; point 11 yields a complex of intermediate type ;
the complexes from points 12 and 13 have their two chief phases inverted as com-
pared to those obtaining over the right heart. Briefly, the responses from the right
ventricle produce electrocardiograms presenting the chief features of dextrograms,
while the responses from the left ventricle produce electrocardiograms showing
the chief features of levograms. Now these facts are not new in their entirety;
the type of response has been extensively studied by many writers; I may refer to
my own summary of such observations,* and to a recent paper by RorHpBercEr and
Win tersere ;Â¢ but several points of importance have hitherto escaped notice or
explanation.

The first point to which I would call attention is the relation between the length
of the interval, signal to first chief phase, and the thickness of the underlying
muscle (Table X). In Curves 12 and 13, and preceding the chief or downwardly
directed movement, there are very evident preliminary phases of a diphasic
character. In Curves 4, 7, 9 and 10 the complex opens with a steep upstroke, and
there is no preliminary phase, but small preliminary phases are distinct in all the
remaining curves.{
