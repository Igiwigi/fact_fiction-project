This result carried much more weight than that from the out-
of-focus 16-inch lens, although the outward movement of the star positions caused by the
presence of the Sun in the latter experiment was observed. Perhaps the most striking diagram
illustrating the significance of the results is diagram 2 of the paper, which shows the
deflections measured in the experiments as a function of distance from the centre of the Sun,
compared with the expectations of the Newtonian (dotted line) and the Einstein (solid line)
predictions (figure 2). A source of some controversy was the fact that the paper describes attempts that were made
to estimate the deflection using the blurred images from the Sobral 16-inch lens. The results
depended upon whether or not there had been a change of scale of the plates because of heating of
the coelostat mirror. If the change of scale were left as a free parameter in the analysis, a deflection
of 0.93 arcsec was found, if it was assumed that there was no change of scale, the deflection was
1.52 arcsec.
