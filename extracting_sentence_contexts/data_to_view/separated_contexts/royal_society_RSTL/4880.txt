The bar must of course be
guaranteed from rust or change of shape. As the test of actual length is required to
be very. exact, the series of experiments should be continued without interruption as
long as possible. I have therefore had an apparatus constructed for swinging these
pendulums #9 vacuo, which, so far as I can judge, will give almost any degree of accuracy
to this part of the inquiry, with very little trouble to the observer ; this was in fact my
first step, and until this was secured I did not think it worth while to apply myself to
the rest of the apparatus.

** The next point is, the very accurate comparison of two bars with each other, the
bars being supposed of the same material. Connected with this is, the determination of
the law of expansion of the metal that may be used, at usnal and moderate temperatures. The preparations for this apparently simple operation will perhaps appear complicated.
