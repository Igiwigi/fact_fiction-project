may have broken into two parts, each containing a single potentially sexual nucleus.

The male nucleus is characterised by a single nucleolus which is always distinctly
larger than that of the female. In most cases there isa considerable quantity of extra-
nucleolar chromatin, Extra-nuclear granules staining deeply in diamant fuchsin are
also usually present. In no case does the nuclear body show any signs of a spiral
curvature, :

The development of the male gametes from the generative cell differs remarkably
from the corresponding series of events in Ephedra and the lower Gymnosperms ; it
appears, however, to be quite similar to those which occur in some species of Gnetum.t
In the omission of the division which cuts off the “stalk-” or “ wall-cell” and in the
fact that the male nuclei are free within the generative cell, Welwitschia and

Gnetum show a close approach to the condition of many Angiosperms.* The last
gymnospermic feature retained in the structure of the pollen-grain is the reduced and
evanescent prothallial cell,t such as is also described for a few Angiosperms.*
