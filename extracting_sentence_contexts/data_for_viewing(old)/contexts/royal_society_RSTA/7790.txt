estimate of the standard error has a standard error of 0-710//n. The probability
distribution of the range between the two extremes of n observations derived from
the normal law has been studied by E. S. Pearson (1926). His results, for n— 200,
500, and 1000, give for the ratios of the standard error of the range to its expectation
the values 0-1 0-086, 0-077; these can be written as 1-46///n, 1-93) /n, 2-43///n,
so that the uncertainty of an estimate from the extremes would be 3 to 5 times that
for the triangular distribution. I am indebted to Mr H. O. Hartley for these values.

Thus with laws practically indistinguishable observationally from the normal law the
the parameters will differ

appropriate treatments of the data to give estimates o
drastically. This fact makes it all the more necessary that we should try to find out
what the law of error really is.

The use of the normal law as an approximation, when the actual error
ofseveral comparable components, does not rest, therefore, on the artific’
of one of those limiting processes that delight the hearts of mathematicians. It is not
necessary that the number of components should be infinite. With quite a small number
of components the law will approach the normal so closely that hundreds or thousands
of observations will be needed to detect any difference. This is the true justification
of the law in these cases, so far as it goes. But it does not justify
law is right at the tails, and therefore does not justify the use of the arithmetic mean.
