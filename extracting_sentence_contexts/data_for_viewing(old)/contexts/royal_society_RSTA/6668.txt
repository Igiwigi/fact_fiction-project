iP Cassels et al. (1947) reported that in approximately 4 °% of fission events, a short-range

"g secondary charged particle was emitted, and that this was probably an a-particle. Such
© particles should be recorded in photographic plates as short tracks originating near the
= centres of the double fission fragment tracks. It is not possible to observe the particles in
BI or C2 emulsions of normal sensitivity because of the heavy background caused by
g the irradiation of the plates with neutrons. Although this background may be largely
# eliminated by means of the desensitization technique, this process necessarily involves the
§ inhibition of some, at least, of the proton tracks present, and therefore of protons which
5 may be emitted in the fission process. However, the results of the counting experiments
E indicated that the particles were probably «-particles, and the tracks of these are not inhibited
© by moderate desensitization. In view of these facts, it was decided to search for particles,
heavier than protons, emitted in the fission process. Accordingly, the investigation was
carried out in plates which were fully sensitive to e-particles and only partially sensitive to
protons; these conditions were realized in C 2 plates impregnated with 0-5 and 1% uranyl
acetate solutions.

The preliminary work was carried out using plates with emulsion coatings 20, thick.
One of the observations made with these plates was that, in a small proportion of fission
events, very long tracks appeared to originate near the point of fission. The range distribu-
tion of these high-energy particles could not be measured accurately because most of them
escaped from the sensitive layer. The abundance was estimated to be approximately one in
300 fission events, and the maximum range observed was 230, equivalent to 43 cm..of air.
