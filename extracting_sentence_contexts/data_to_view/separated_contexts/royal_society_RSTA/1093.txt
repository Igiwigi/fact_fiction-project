The periods are then randomly reordered and a new phase time series
is constructed based on the reordered sequence. The process is repeated until the desired number
of surrogate time series is obtained. Note the difference from the IID surrogates when the elements
of time series are randomly reordered generating a white noise sample, while here we in fact
reorder the whole cycles. For ‘continuous’ Hilbert phase, obtained according to equation (3.5), essentially the same
procedure applies but care must be taken to preserve the intra-period information in the
signal. The signal is first divided into periods and all the periods except the first and last
are permuted randomly.
