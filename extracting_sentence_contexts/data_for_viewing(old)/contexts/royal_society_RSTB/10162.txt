e-mail: fujita@fbs.osaka-u.acjp The world we see with two eyes working together is vividly three dimensional.
We feel, in addition to understanding, that every object has a particular shape
and thickness, occupies a volume and is separated in depth from others in
space. This sensation of three-dimensionality originates from the fact that the
left and right eyes view the world from laterally separated positions. The geo-
metry creates a tiny horizontal shift between the projections of each visual
feature onto the respective retinae, i.e. binocular disparity. A feature at the fix-
ation distance yields zero disparity; otherwise, the sign of the disparity signifies
whether a feature is in front of or behind the fixation depth and the magnitude
of disparity is approximately proportional to the distance in depth of the feature
from the fixation depth. The visual system uses this cue to achieve a reliable and
accurate sense of depth, and support manipulation of three-dimensional objects
and navigation in three-dimensional environments [1-3].

In this process of binocular depth perception, or stereopsis, the visual
system should match corresponding features in the two retinal images (stereo
