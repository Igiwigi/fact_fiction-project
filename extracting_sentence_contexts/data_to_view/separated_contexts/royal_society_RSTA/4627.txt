derived from certain physical laws or other constraints
governing the phase transition. The interplay of the state laws for the single
phases and the special phase transition conditions
leads to a mathematical discipline that combines
analysis and geometry in sophisticated ways, together
with mathematical modelling based on physics and
engineering. Let us point out a basic division of the set
of FBPs.
