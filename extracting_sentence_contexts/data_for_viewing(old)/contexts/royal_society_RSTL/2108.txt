water; yet even in this instance the water had become
slightly alkaline at one pole, and acid at the other.

These experiments, showing the nature of the chemical
changes in combinations made active by their connexion with
Voltaic batteries, and the influence of the newly developed
chemical agents, fully explain the phenomena of the secon-
dary piles of M. RiTTER ; and combined with the fact, that
the metals are not PERFECT conductors for electricities of very
low intensity, they offer a simple and adequate solution of
the circumstances observed by M. Dt La Rive on the inter-
position of different metallic plates in the fluids connecting
together Voltaic combinations.*

From the nature of the chemical changes taking place in
each single circle of a common Voltaic battery, it is evident,
that if any small part of a battery for some time in action, is
separated from the whole, and made to act as a distinct com-
bination, its powers must be feebler than if it had been ori-
ginally an independent series; for the electrical action occa-
