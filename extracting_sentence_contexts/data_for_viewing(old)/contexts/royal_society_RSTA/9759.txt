then no further appreciable changes follow before the whole experiment is completed.
Viewed mathematically, we have but re-stated the case; in so far as the actual
weighing is concerned, the results are precisely the same.

The mixture left in the flask after concluding the experiments with the tantalum
lamp, proved on examination to be very acid. The clear liquid obtained on filtering,
contained in addition to acids, ferrous, ferric, and silver salts; the undissolved portion
which was somewhat yellow, contained metallic silver, silver nitrate and some salts of
iron. We must now leave the chemical problem here presented to be more fully
dealt with in some future communication; but from the remarks made, it will be
abundantly evident that the chemical equation set forth on p. 230 gives but a very

incomplete representation of the actual facts; that equation may indeed represent

more or less correctly, the initial stage of the whole reaction, but it is quite clear
that other and perhaps somewhat involved and little understood chemical changes
are induced some time later, the period varying greatly with the conditions of light,
heat, &c.

Seeing then that a close study of one apparently simple chemical reaction led to such
totally unexpected conclusions, and remembering that the nature of some of the other
