This decrease in resource availability ultimately led to less
chick provisioning. The combined result of these two events
was complete reproductive failure of the colonyâ€”which may
have significant future consequences for the population as
well as the local ecosystem [28]. This case highlights the fact
that to us, seemingly positive environmental changes such as
increased temperature and decreased wind speed may in com-
bination constitute an extreme event for a species adapted to a
polar environment. Further, it illustrates the need to integrate
climatic and biological definitions when assessing whether

an extreme event has occurred. 8. A new take on the biological-based approach
to extreme climatological events:
physiological mechanisms using allostasis as a
