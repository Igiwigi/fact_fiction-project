The corrections due to / and 4 do not vary with the connexions of the inductive
coils. The quantities AM,, AM,, AR, and o, differ, however, by small amounts
for the eight connexions used (see p. 433). This is due to the fact that they are
largely determined by the capacitances of the system, which alter with the different
connexions. These four quantities are also functions of the frequency, varying very
nearly as the square of the frequency. The corrections are very much larger, and
so determinable with correspondingly higher accuracy, at higher frequencies.
