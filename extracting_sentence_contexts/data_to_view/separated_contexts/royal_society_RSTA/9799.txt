function of position. (See Appendix.) Squaring both sides of (7), multiplying by I
and making the summation, we have by a property of the (P)’s (see Appendix,
equations (81) and (32))

Now it has been found that by a judicious choice of a, a, ..., a, the quantity
[(-**) (1% ) Rie «(1% )] may be made small for all possible values of d,?.

(Thus fig. 1 shows this done for a set of seven (a)’s, This graph was arrived at by
trial.) The error E,,; of 4; may therefore be made small in comparison with that
of ¢,. This is possible because the values of ),’ lie in a finite range; corresponding
to the fact that there are only a finite number of terms in the series SA,P,. A similar
process will not work with the infinite series of sines, Bessel functions and other
infinitesimal integrals of (0—\) P = 0. In choosing a, a, ..., @, a diagram of the
kind shown in figs. 1 and 2 is a great help.
