Upon the theory of the experiments 29 and 30 I will venture no positive opinion.
That gaseous hydrogen should abstract oxygen from hydrogen, without the latter
forming any other combination, is a fact 80 novel, that any attempted explanation is
likely to prove premature. If, contrary to the views of Darrox, we suppose that
gases when mixed are held together by a feeble chemical affinity, then we may say
that the affinity of the nitrogen or carbonic acid for hydrogen produces the effect ;
the affinity of the oxygen of the water, being balanced between the hydrogen in the
liquid and that in the tube, would enable the resultant feeble aflinity of the nitrogen
for hydrogen to prevail; but on this supposition, why does not oxygen produce an
analogous effect? Its tendency directly to combine with platinum may indeed be
regarded as an opposing force, but this tendency is by many considered hypothetical.
On the other hand, it may be called an effect of contact ; but this, unconnected with
a chemical theory, presents no other idea to the mind than the fact itself presents, it
furnishes no link by which we may extend the phenomena. TI therefore, until a better
theory be found, should be inclined to adopt the former view, and to regard mixed
gas as in a state of feeble chemical union, the more especially as throughout nature
we find no absolute lines of demarcation, though for conventional reasons we are
obliged to adopt them ; there must be many cases in which it is difficult, if not im-
possible, to draw the line between mechanical mixture and chemical combination.

In conclusion, I would say with regard to the whole of the experiments contained
in this paper, that a longer time and more experience may give positive results in
cases where I have only obtained negative ones ; it is far from impossible that since
curious solid combinations are formed by slow electrical currents, as in the experi-
ments of Crosss and BExcqQUEREL, 80 novel gaseous or liquid products may be ob-
