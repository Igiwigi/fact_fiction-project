(c.) Development.

It is well known that chromatophores, both black and coloured, appear in

the development of Teleosteans at a very early age, namely, long before the
larva is hatched. The appearance of the chromatophores in the newly hatched —

Flounder, and up to an early stage of the metamorphosis, when the little Fish is 10°5
millims. long, is figured in my ‘ Treatise on the Sole,’ Plate 17, figs. 3-5. Up to the
stage last-mentioned, iridocytes and argenteum are wanting, in fact the reflecting

substance in any form is entirely absent, both from the skin and the peritoneum ;_

there may be some in the eye, but that organ is here excluded from consideration.

On the other hand, in young Flounders, 15 millims. long, in which the metamorphosis — |

has been completed for some time, iridocytes are present in considerable abundance
both in the upper and lower sides, but the argenteum has not yet appeared. On the
upper side the iridocytes at this stage are more abundant than on the lower, the
converse of the relation in the adult condition ; but even on the upper side they
are not uniformly distributed, but are crowded together in the neighbourhood of the
