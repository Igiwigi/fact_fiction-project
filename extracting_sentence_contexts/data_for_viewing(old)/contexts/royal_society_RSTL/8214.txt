definite round one of the bars than round the other; but 80 slight a difference would
not authorize us to admit the existence of a s8mall amount of inclined dispersion, the
combination of which with the twisted dispersion ( dispersion tournante ”) would suffice
to characterize a substance belonging to the triclinic system, unless the plates of Ambly-
gonite from Montebras (formerly Montebrasite) possessed perfect homogeneity. The

* The oil I used was very viscous, and had the indices n,=1:476; n;=1:478.

+ In Montebrasite (formerly Amblygonite), State of Maine, one has, on the contrary, g<v on either side of
the acute bisector ; 80 that this oppoite character in the proper dispersion of the optic axes would snffice to
distinguish Amblygonite from Montebrasite, since it forms a distinctive character of the highest importance in
erystallized substances, and scems to be the most constant of all their properties as optically birefringent
snbstances. Tn fact there is no example of a single well-defined species of a natural or artificial product
presenting in different specimens optic axes with opposite dispersions, provided that these axes are situated in
the same plane ; and this is true whateyer may be the variations in their physical and chemical characters.
It is only when the hxes pass from one plane into a cond perpendicular to it, as happens in orthose,
heulandite, and other minerals, that any change takes place in the relative positions of the axes corresponding
to the red rays with regard to the axes which correspond to the blue.

+ Under the same cireumstances Montebrasite of Hebron and Montebras presents a horizontal dispersion in
combination with a well-marked inclined dispersion. The phenomena to which those different kinds of
dizpersion give rise in the coloured rings aro described and figured in my © Memoire sur Vemploi du
microscope polarisant,”” im the © Annales des Mines * for 1864, tom. vi. 6th series,
