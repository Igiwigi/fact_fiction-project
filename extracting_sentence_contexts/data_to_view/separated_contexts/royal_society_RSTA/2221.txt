Maxwell pointed to the difference from astronomy where
Newtonian theory worked well, for its role was purely to account for the observations. However,

when we ... believe that the phenomena which fall under our observation form but a very
small part of what is really going on in the system, the question is... what is the most
general specification ... consistent with the condition that the motions of those parts of the
system which we can observe are what we find them to be? It is to Lagrange ... that we
owe the method which enables us to answer this question without asserting either more or
less than all that can be legitimately deduced from the observed facts [60, pp. 781-782]. But Kelvin and Tait’s application of the method to vortices was widely attacked, for example
by Ludwig Boltzmann, John Purser (Professor of Mathematics at the Queen’s College, Belfast),
and Carl Neumann [61]. The problem was the lack of any proof of the validity of the equations
in situations where there were infinite degrees of freedom, which were not recognized in the
generalized coordinates.
