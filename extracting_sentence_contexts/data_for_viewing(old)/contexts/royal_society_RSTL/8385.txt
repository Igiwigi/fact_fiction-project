the compression of the metacarpals of the middle digits and the approximation of their
distal ends. The two middle digits diyerge in treading on the ground; but, by the same
action, their proximal extremities tend to converge ; and, owing to the special disposition
of the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation, they compress the two metacarpals or meta-
tarsals together. In such animals as the Hog, in which this disposition is strongly de-
veloped, and aided by a special adaptation of the tarsal, and to some extent carpal, bones
to bring together the proximal extremities of the two middle digits, these two practically
work like the cannon of a Ruminant. Tn Hyopotamus, however, this disposition is
only indicated, while it is developed much better in Diplopus.

The lateral digits of the Zyopotanmns are very well

b developed, and, in fact, besides the
Hippopotamus, we know of no animal in which they

: are 80 complete and relatively large
as in Hyopotamus. Tt is possible that in Anthracotherium they took even a more im-
portant part in locomotion ; but the complete limbs of Anthracotherium are not fully
known at the present time.

The inner or 8ec0nd metacarpal (Plate XXXVII. fig. 20, & Plate XXXVIIL. fig. 5, 11.)
is represented in all collections I have visited only by its proximal half. The upper or
proximal extremity of the second digit presents an elongated and concave articular
surface for the distal face of the trapezoid ;
