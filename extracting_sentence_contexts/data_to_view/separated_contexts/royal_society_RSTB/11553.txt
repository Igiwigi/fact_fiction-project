Interference was indistinguishable for similar
(e.g. central letter task versus peripheral letter task) and
dissimilar (e.g. central letter task versus peripheral motion
task) task combinations, which highlights that different visual
discriminations likely exhaust the same attentional capacity. However, it is not clear if the same logic can be applied to
subjective ratings and metacognition (type 2 AUC). In fact,
we identified two outlier subjects (figure 4) who clearly vio-
late the assumptions of dual-task studies. These two subjects
did not distinguish correct and incorrect trials in terms of
PAS in the single task but did so in the dual task. There
can be several possible reasons for this behaviour.
