The mito-
chondrial cloud is at its maximum stage of development in oocytes of 100 to 140p in
diameter. At this time a more definite and homogeneous structure differentiates, in
the middle of the mitochondrial cloud, which I propose to call the mitochondrial yolk-
body (Plate 17, fig. 13; Plate 19, fig. 32). On account of its exact similarity in staining

there are much fewer individual mitochondria apparent in the cell immediately after its
