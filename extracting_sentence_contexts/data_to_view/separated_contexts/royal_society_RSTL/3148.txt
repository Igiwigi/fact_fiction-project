There must consequently still
remain a portion of electricity sufficient to electrify the remote section poxsitively, al-
though not equivalent to the negative state of the three slices taken together, and
remoyed from without the influence of the charged body. :

12. Since then the negative state of an indefinitely thin slice b, immediately opposed
to the charged body, may be supposed to depend on the electricity displaced from it,
and collected in the detached gentral mass N, we may conclude, in accordance with
the well-known fact, that this negative state will be the greatest possible when the
electrical capacity of N is indefinitely great, that is, to say, when it is connected with
the ground, and whilst the influence of the charged body M is still operating on it. The near surface 6, therefore, of a free neutral body, N, fig. 3, under the induction of
' a body, M, positively charged, is greater than would be apparent upon the whole
body after cutting off its connexion with the earth.
