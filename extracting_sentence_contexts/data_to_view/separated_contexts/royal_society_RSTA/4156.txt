However, the data produced by such an
experiment cannot be represented by equation (3.6). In other words, the class of conceivable SG
experiments is significantly larger than the class of experiments that allows for the separation: the
class of realizable SG experiments is (much) larger than the class of SG experiments describable
by quantum theory. The fact that the separation procedure leads, in such a simple manner, to the quantum
theoretical description (3.6) of the SG experiment provokes the question: ‘What is so special
about the case in which the separation procedure can be carried out?’ The answer is given in
§2. Using equation (3.6), according to the postulate of quantum theory [46], the probability to
observe an event x is given by P(x) = Tr p(1 + xa-o)/2 =(1 + xa- M)/2, which is exactly the same
expression as the one obtained by LI treatment of a robust SG experiment. In other words, if the
SG experiment is robust, it may be equally well described by quantum theory.
