IN CONNEXION WITH THE SPECTRUM OF THE SUN. 265

In the case of the chromosphere, the observation of the order of lengths of the
bright lines is invested with a new importance, as also the observation of lines which
are not reyersed in the ordinary solar spectrum. As an instance of this, I may state
that the fact that the re-reversal into brightness in the chromosphere of the line 1474 K
is not, due to iron vapour, is settled by the other fact, which this new method has
enabled me to determine, that the coincident line in the iron spectrum is one of the
shortest lines in the whole spectrum.

In the case of the photosphere, not only may we hope to account for snch cyclical

changes as I have long had reason to suspect and have referred to in prior communica-
F tions to the Society, but it is essential that spot-spectra shall be photographed with
Special reference to the consideration that in 8uch spectra the new lines may now be
Fefound in all probability, to be those which are only slightly shorter than those
Zordinarily reversed. This research I am making arrangements to carry on.

SZ Tt will be observed that in the maps*the elements are arranged in the order of their
