appearance is no proof whatever that plant structures were not present and
decomposed during the formation of the mineral concretions. In fact, a number of
cases can be observed illustrating this in an ordinary “ coal ball,” where the process
has taken place on a smaller scale, and in the midst of a stem otherwise preserved so
that each cell is recognisable small concretionary masses may be seen with no trace
of plant tissue in their purely crystalline structure. In such cases we know that
the water in which the mineral was deposited could not have been free from plant
débris, none the less the mineral appears now to be free from it. We need not
follow the argument further: enough has been said to show that there is strong *
evidence on the side of the view that the Wirral dolomite was deposited amidst
plant débris at the same time that the coal was being formed. When compared
with the “coal ball” formation in the lower seams, it becomes clear that the case is
not unique as Mr, SrraAHAN supposed, and that in fact it is quite a parallel develop-
ment to that which formed the coal balls. This case is a useful example to illustrate
the great size which may be reached by mineral masses in coal, and affords a further
illustration of what we saw in the lower beds, viz., that they may be very much too
large to have been transported after their formation, No one could suggest that

a seam of rock 3 feet thick and several hundred yards in extent could have been
brought as such and deposited in the coal.
