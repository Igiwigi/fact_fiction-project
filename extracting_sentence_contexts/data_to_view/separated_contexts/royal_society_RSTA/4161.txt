There are some special difficulties standing in the way of the measurement of the
bismuth lines, which made us hesitate some time before definitely asserting the
different curvature of the lines, but we think that our best photographs, one of which
is reproduced in fig. 25, leave no doubt on the question. One of the difficulties lies in
the fact that bismuth and mercury are the only metals in which the lines are repeated,
owing to the oscillatory discharges. When six jars are in circuit, the appearance is
that of fig. 26, and the lines become mixed and difficult to measure.
