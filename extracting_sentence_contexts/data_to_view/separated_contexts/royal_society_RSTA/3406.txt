Consider next a thick film of gold. The absorption being now, according to the result given on p. 409, dependent
principally upon the value of n«/k, we see from the table for v« or from the graph
that, for the solid metal, yellow light is less absorbed than red. The colour of thick
gold leaf is, in fact, olive-green by transmitted light. As » diminishes the absorption
of both yellow and red increases, the latter more rapidly. Now when p = ‘734, there
isa great absorption of red, according to the values of mx, which is intensified, since My
is for this value of n reduced to ‘177.
