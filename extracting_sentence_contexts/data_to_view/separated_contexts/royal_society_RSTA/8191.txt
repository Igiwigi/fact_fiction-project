The analysis
previously adopted for finding the effect of wind in producing surface waves over large
areas of the sea and the corresponding elastic waves over the surface of the earth takes
account of the finite depth of water and will therefore hold approximately for the
shallow sea near the coast, provided we assume an average value for the depth between
the coast line and 15 miles off the coast. The analysis, of course, makes the assumption
that the sea is unlimited in extent, but in the shallow sea near the coast we have plainly
a boundary. The effect of the boundary will in general be expressed by the known fact
that a set of waves in advancing against a sloping beach will maintain their periods but
will diminish in wave-length and speed. The periods of the waves over the earth’s
surface will, therefore, be given approximately, as before, by

where dis the average depth of water. The observed periods of waves over the shallow
sea near the coast agree fairly well with those given by this formula.
