modes of economic production. As in Borgerhoff Mulder et al.
[24], we examine a range of wealth variables that capture hol-
istic indicators of well-being, and include material assets,
physical health, skills and social capital, greatly expanding
the previous focus among economists on income and
education. We include reproductive success (RS) in this
examination of the multiple dimensions of wealth insofar as
it captures aspects of somatic wealth (such as health and
nutrition) that influence an individual's ability to produce
and successfully raise offspring [75,76]. Furthermore, individ-
uals in most of our samples generally view children (and
large families) as a manifestation of prosperity, despite the
fact that most sampled societies are no longer characterized
by natural fertility.

While we start from the assumption that sex-biased par-
ental investment can be detected from parent-offspring
wealth correlations, we recognize that inferring parental dis-
crimination per se from such data can be problematic [53,77].
This is because many dynamics can contribute to offspring
resembling their parents. These include: first, genetic inheri-
tance that can influence a personâ€™s ability to produce wealth
via heritable traits like health or stature; second, cultural trans-
mission whereby offspring learn the beliefs, values and
behaviour of their parents and thus achieve similar wealth out-
