ments where alternating and impact stresses were employed is of the same nature as
that previously determined by Taytor and Exam for static tensile strain.)

(3) The effect of slip on any plane was at first to increase its resistance to further
slip. At the same time a similar hardening effect was produced on other planes—

(a) on planes parallel to the original slip-planes,
(6) on planes intersecting the original slip-planes,

The experiments indicated that the resistance to slip was increased in a greater degree
on planes of type (b) than on those of type (a).

(4) The fact that extension always took place under reversed stresses suggests that
the resistance to slip on any plane was greater when the normal stress across the plane
was compressive than when it was tensile. Apart from this effect, slip in any part of
a specimen appeared to be confined to that octahedral plane on which the shear stress
in one of the principal atomic directions was the greatest.

(5) The hardening effects mentioned above appear to be connected in some way with
a permanent distortion of the lattice of the crystal. A similar conclusion has been
reached by several other workers. In particular, Carpenter and ELAM* suggest that
this distortion may be a uniform bending of the crystal planes ; it is considered that
the present tests do not confirm this view.
