and the irregularity in the present case is therefore 8omewhat unusnal. It depends

Planes parallel to it. The latter cleavages would not be visible externally, but might
tard the gurface cleavages ab certain periods. This is apparently the true explana-
Sion of the long delay of forty-five minutes between figs.
