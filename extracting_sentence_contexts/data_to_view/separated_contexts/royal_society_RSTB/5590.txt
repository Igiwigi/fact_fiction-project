The secondary sexual characters
developed at the same rate as the control (Experiment III) in which the higher tem-
perature was maintained. The development of the secondary sexual characters therefore
does not depend on the environment of the fish being above a certain threshold tem-
perature. Further evidence of this fact is given by the development of the sexual
characters at a temperature of 8Â° C. in Experiment XVI. The fish are at this tem-
perature both in their natural habitat in April and in Experiment V, without the
secondary sexual characters. It is clear that a rise of temperature is one of the
conditions essential to the development of the secondary sexual characters.
