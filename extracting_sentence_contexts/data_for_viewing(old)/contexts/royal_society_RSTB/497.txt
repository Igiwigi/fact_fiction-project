them en bloc.

We must here allude to certain side issues connected with our method before
entering upon the task of classifying and collating the results obtained.

The recording apparatus, as before stated, gave us the movements of the thoracic
walls only, the ascent of the curve marking a natural inspiration or an artificial
inflation of the chest. Our tracings consequently give variations in the depth of the
movements of inspiration and expiration, as well as changes in the rhythm. We,
however, also employed on many occasions artificial respiration ; this, especially after
the observations of Herine and Breuer,” is well known to notably affect the respi-
ratory centre in the medulla oblongata. We would propose, therefore, in view of
these facts, to arrange the results as follows :—

Inspiration
(a.) Changes in rhythm... Expiration
| Pause
Inspiration
Expiration
Pause

(Changes in respira-
tion uncompli- | (b.) Concomitant changes in rhythm
cated by artificial | and extent
