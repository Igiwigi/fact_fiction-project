This mechanism, common to most fishes, and so different
from what is met with in land animals, where the blood is
forced by the action of the left ventricle into the different
parts of the body, appears to be intended to prevent too great

5 Having traced in these different gradations the guards upon
b=5 the circulation through the gills in fishes, I am led to extend
S my remarks to the hearts of a lower class of animals. In the
2 Mollusca there is no reason for putting guards upon the action
i= of the heart, as in fishes, because in them the blood first sup-
Z plies the different parts of the body, and only in its return
i= passes through the gills; but there is a regulation of another
S kind, by means of which the circulation is increased or dimi-
S_ nished, according to the activity or torpor of the animal. In
E. the teredines, where a boring engine, requiring a great mus-
E cular power to work it, is almost constantly employed, the
= heart consists of two auricles and two ventricles ; the auricles
[- strong, cylindrical, and having valves between them and the
& ventricles; the ventricles themselves very strong, 80 that in
65 fact there is a heart, composed of two auricles and two ven=
= tricles, both acting at the same time, and the blood is hurried
5 on by a double power to supply the muscles of the boring
= shells, and, in this part of its course, has a bright red colour. In the Oyster, on the other hand, the heart consists of only |
one auricle and one ventricle, both very weak in their muscular |

power, when compared with those of the teredines, although
belonging to an animal of larger dimensions ; but the heart is

laterally connected to the great muscle that shuts the shell, 80
that whenever that muscle is actively employed, its lateral swell
presses against the heart, and forces out the blood, and by this
means gives activity to the circulation, at the only time in
which an increased circulation is particularly required.
