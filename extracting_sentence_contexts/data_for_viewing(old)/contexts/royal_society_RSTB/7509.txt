chloride, the following results were obtained: total N, 25-8; arginine-N, 25-2; the
theoretical nitrogen content being 26-6 %. The specimen thus contained 97:0 or 94-7 %
of arginine hydrochloride according to the respective determinations with the Kjeldahl
or hydrolysis procedures. If the impurity indicated by the total nitrogen content to be
present in the arginine was non-nitrogenous, it is evident that, as Macpherson claims,

the recovery of arginine by the hydrolysis procedure, which in the above experiment
amounts to 97-7 %, is not complete. Estimations made on proteins would, in fact,
require correcting by the addition of 2:3 % to the determined values. We are, however,
loth to apply such a correction for the following reasons. Determination of the arginine
content of salmine gave an uncorrected value, expressed as the percentage of the total
nitrogen due to arginine, of 88-9. If this were increased by 2-3 %, it would become
practically 91, a value which is, we believe, higher than any recorded value. Thus,
recent values from the literature are: 90-2 (Block & Bolling 19454), 86-5 (Macpherson
1946) and 89 (Tristam 1947). While this result gives some support to the view that the
impurity in our specimen of arginine is nitrogenous it is by no means conclusive. There is,
moreover, a further complication due to the possibility that amino-acids other than
arginine may contribute a small quota of ammonia during the hydrolysis. We have
therefore deemed it preferable to quote uncorrected results. As those obtained with sal-
mine show, these must give substantially, if not absolutely, correct values for arginine,
