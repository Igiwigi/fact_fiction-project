MR. G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSR. 725

or not an anzsthetic, will do the same. That nitrite of amy], caffein, &c. shonld do 80,
one would not be very surprised to hear; but it would scarcely be expected that
strychnine, for instance, should block contractile waves ; yet it does 80 even in doses
80 s8mall as only just to taste bitter. Nay, even fresh water completely blocks contractile
waves after the strip has been exposed to its influence for about half an hour, and exerts
a permanently slowing effect after the tissne is restored to sea-water. These facts how
the extreme sensitiveness of the nervo-muscular tissues of the Medusz to any change in
the character of their snrrounding medium—a sensitiveness which we shall again have
occasion to comment upon when treating of the effects of poisons,

(7) In conclusion, I may mention an interesting fact which is probably connected with
the summation of stimuli before explained. When a contractile strip is allowed to rest
for a minute or more, and a wave is then made to traverse it, careful observation will show
that the passage of this wave is slower than that of its snccessor, provided the latter
follows the former after not too great an interval of time. The difference, however, is
exceedingly slight, s0 that to render it apparent at all the longest possible strips must
be nsed; and even then the experimenter may fail to detect the difference, unless he
has been accustomed to signalling, by which method all these observations on rate have
to be made.

(B) Stimulus-waves.—(a) The rate of transmission of tentacular waves is only one
half that of contractile waves, viz. 9 inches a second. This fact appeared to me very
remarkable, in view of the consideration that the tentacular wave is the optical expres-
