Again, we required representation at each of these levels within
each ecoregion. Because the corridors were more widely spread
than the refugia, this involved protecting corridors in 21 ecore-
gions. To account for the fact that corridors often spanned
more than one site, we forced the reserve-selection algorithm to
prioritize sites that shared a common corridor. All site selection was done with the conservation planning
software Marxan [43]. MarxaNn uses simulated annealing to
find sets of sites that protect the conservation elements—species,
refugia, corridors, in the present study—while minimizing the
total cost of the reserve network.
