Hence
OV=—009-9V,s,

or, substituting for 00 and V,0 their values, this is

==® (—56)—9: Ai-atl Moreover V does not become infinite for any values of (4... c, e), e not =0; and it
vanishes for points at  ; and not only s0, but for indefinitely large values of any of the
coordinates (4... e, &) it reduces itself to a numerical multiple of (4... +@+@)-*7;
in fact in this case 0 is indefinitely large, =... +@+@: consequently throughout
the integral 7 is indefinitely large, and we may therefore write

g=NE
