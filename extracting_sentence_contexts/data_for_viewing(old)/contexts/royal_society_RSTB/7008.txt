on one side (figure 5). Still higher, more vascular tissue, interrupted by parenchymatous
gaps, appears till finally it extends completely round the section (figures 6, 7). This con-
tinuous ring can be followed upwards to the region where it is differentiated immediately
below the apical meristem (figure 8). In this specimen, the three or four new leaf primordia
were still of very small size and so far no leaf-gaps had developed (Wardlaw 1944), 19452).
Figures 78, 79, plate 10, show the solenostele observed in an older specimen, and the small
gaps associated with the insertion of the new leaf primordia. Figure 81, plate 10, shows the
dictyostelic shoot and leaf-bases of a still older specimen in which fourteen new â€˜leaf
primordia had developed; figure 80, plate 10, is a section of the same shoot but taken lower
down.

As shown in figure 6, the outer limit of the stele in the lower region of an isolated terminal
region is parallel to the perimeter of the section. The stele, in fact, is of rectangular outline.
In other instances where a triangular system of incisions was used (figures 9, 10), the stele
was of triangular outline; and in yet others where a rectangular system was used, the stele
was of rectangular outline. The shape of the stele, in fact, is directly related to the cross-
sectional outline of the isolated terminal region. Higher up, where there is a return to
the approximately cylindrical shape of the normal shoot, the stele is approximately circular
in transverse section (figures 78, 81, plate 10). Figure 11 shows a transverse section of
a shoot which had been dissected by six radial longitudinal incisions, the apical meristem
being left intact. Here again it will be seen that the outlines of stele and shoot are in close

agreement.
