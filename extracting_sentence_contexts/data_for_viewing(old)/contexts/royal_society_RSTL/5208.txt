Sof the body, and of an internal or endodermic layer (fig. 96, b), which is in the same
Bray a continuation of the endoderm of the stomach. The tentacular ectoderm has
been already described.. The: endoderm consists of rather large celis with very deli-
Scate walls; it, constitutes a, thick lining of the, tube, and nearly fills up the entire
Zeavity.z and indeed this cavity, by, a temporary approximation of its walls, appears
Zeapable of occasional obliteration.., 'The cells of the tentacular endoderm are glan-
=dular, and may be generally seen to contain the peculiar brown granules character-
Zistic of the, general endodermic secretion. The appearance; of transyerse septa is
Zprobably due to the occurrence at regular interyals, of interruptions in the continuity
Sof the endodermic layer.
E Though the tentacula of Zydra present no appearance of the transyerse septa, their
Sstructure is nevertheless essentially the same as; that of the tentacula of Cordylophora,
the only difference being in the fact that the endoderm forms a thinner stratum in
Sllydra, and thus encroaches less. on the cavity of the tube, and does not present the
8uccessive interruptions which in Cordylophora give rise to the fallacious appearance
Qof transyerse septa.

(d.) Canal of the Camosare.â€”The cavity of the stomach is continuous posteriorly
with, the canal of the ccenosare, fig. 3 h, The rounded masses of cells constituting
the. large ruge into which the endoderm of the stomach is thrown, cannot be traced
further back than the posterior extremity of the clayate body of the polype, and from
this point, which may be conveniently though somewhat, arbitrarily assumed as the
posterior termination: of the stomach,, the canal of the canosarc commences, and
thence. extends as, a continuous tube through all the ramifications of the ceenosarc.
In that portion, of the canal which immediately succeeds to the stomach, and which
