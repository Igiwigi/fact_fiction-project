* These results were obtained in the absence of seed grains; even when grains are present in such con-
ditions they do not grow, so that these figures can be considered as consistent with the others in the table.

It is clear from table 2 that most of the phosphorus compound is absorbed during growth
and removed from solution in spite of the fact that Calgon is a very soluble material. Indeed
the effect is most noteworthy when the Calgon is present at the lowest concentrations.

Table 3 gives the results of calculations (based on the data of table 2) showing the P,O,
contents of solution and solid phases in the various experiments, correlated with the various
modes of precipitation of calcium carbonate which have already been described.
