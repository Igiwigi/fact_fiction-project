have black. There was no uncertainty in scenario 1 and the ‘red line event’ has not created : a
any less or more uncertainty. [8

— Scenario 2'. Having crossed the red line, there are now 5 black squares and 1 white one. .
Bob’s white square now makes him think (using the scenario 2) he is not sure about
Alice’s colour. Clearly, the ‘red line’ event has augmented the uncertainty in this scenario.

— Scenario 3’. After the red line event, the 3 white squares have become 3 black squares and
the 3 black squares have become 3 white squares. The uncertainty, which we already had
before the red line event, has not been changed.

After considering these simple scenarios, we could argue that the presence of information
reduces uncertainty. If an information event were to augment uncertainty, then in fact this
information adds to dis-information, ie. the opposite of information. A formal definition of
information can be given by the so-called Fisher information, I, defined as J(/P)(dP/dx) dx,
where P(.) is the pdf on noise ‘x’ derived from Xobs : Xobs = X0 +X. Hence, in scenario 2’, the red
line event creates more noise, and thus augments uncertainty. Hence, the red line event reduces
(Fisher) information. The red line event does not create (or reduce) information in either scenario
Vor scenario 3’.

Since the red line event does not change uncertainty in scenarios 1, and 1’; 3 and 3’, if we
were to look for an approximation of instantaneous knowledge (approximating the notion of
non-locality), we could find it in scenarios 1 and 1’, and (with uncertainty) in scenarios 3 and 3’.
But in scenarios 2 and 2’: the event space has changed unbeknownst to Alice and Bob and this
change has diminished information. We can almost argue for an approximate level of ‘non-local’
