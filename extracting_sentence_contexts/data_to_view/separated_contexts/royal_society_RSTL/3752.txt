'These rays are distinguished from those of light by being
invisible; they are also distinguished from the purely calorific rays beyond the spec-
trum by their possessing the properties recorded in Arts. 160, 223, either exclusively of
the calorific rays, or in a very much higher degree. They may perhaps not improperly
be regarded as bearing the same relation to the calorific spectrum which the photogra-
phic rays do to the luminous one, and if the restriction to these rays of the term
thermic as distinet from calorific be not (as I think in fact it is not) a sufficient di-
stinction, I would propose the term parathermic rays to designate them. These are
the rays (if I may indulge in speculation which I propose to bring to the test of ex-
periment hereafter) which I conceive to be active in producing those singular mole-
cular affections which determine the precipitation of yapours in the experiments of
Messrs. Draetr, Moser, and Huxr, and which will probably lead to important dis-
coveries as to the intimate nature of those forces resident on the surfaces of bodies to
which M. DuTrocner has given the name of epipolic forces. These als, I cannot,
help considering it as highly probable, are the rays which radiated from molecule to
molecule in the interior of bodies, determine the discharge of vegetable colours at the
boiling temperature (se Art. 162), and the innumerable isomeric and other atomic
transformations of organic bodies which take place at temperatures below redness.
