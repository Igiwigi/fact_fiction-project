the complicated elongation process. Now, whilst the spiral structure of a tracheid
can readily be deduced in the polarizing microscope, the walls of the meristem
cells appear to be quite isotropic, i.e., devoid of such doubly refractive effects as
would imply a regular cellulose structure. This may be due either to the extreme

thinness of the wall, or to a lack of parallel arrangement of the particles of cellulose
composing it. ‘The former view is held by Frey, and seems to be the most probable.
The fact that primary walls do not give double refractive effects does not prohibit
a space-latticed structure, and the following considerations lead us to suspect that
these walls have, in fact, just such a structure as the thicker, double refractive ones
later deposited on them.*

In the laying down of new wall layers two factors are obviously concerned :

(1) The structure of the old wall upon which the new layer is deposited.
(2) The structure of the protoplasmic surface at the time of deposition.

The actual manner in which the protoplasmic surface offers an orienting mechanism
is not yet clear. It may be chemical as favoured by Devaux (1928), in spite of
Frey’s assertion to the contrary ; it may be mechanical, e.g., streaming as favoured
by Denuam (1923) ; but the actual mechanism itself is not of immediate importance.
The developing tracheid does not undergo much deformation as the secondary wall
