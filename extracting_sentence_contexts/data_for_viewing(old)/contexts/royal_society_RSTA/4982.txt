of F is trivial.

If F is of SL,-type, we will also need to understand the set
Auti(F) ={vye PGL (Fp) | y*F =~ D(F) @ & for some rank 1 sheaf L},

which we define for any middle-extension ¢-adic sheaf F.

This definition implies that Auto(F) acts on Auti(s) by left-multiplication: for elements
y € Auto(F) and y, € Auti(s), we have yy < Auti(5). This action is simply transitive (if 1,
y2€ Auti(F), we get y = nyt € Auto(F) with y2 = yy). This means that Auti(F) is either empty
or is a right coset Auto(F) of Auto(F).

There is another extra property: if y € Auti(F), the fact that D(D(F)) ~F implies that ye
Auto(F).

In particular? for a sheaf with Auto(F)=1 (e.g. a bountiful sheaf), there are only two
possibilities: either Auti(F) is empty, or it contains a single element & , and the latter is an
involution: 2 = 1. If this second case holds, we say that és is the special involution of F. (For
instance, we will see that for hyper-Kloosterman sums K ¢, with r odd, there is a special involution
which is x —x.)

1See the notation section for a remainder of the definition.

2See lemma 3.1 for a more general statement, based on these properties, that limits the possible structure of Auti(J).
