Decisions based on code-driven regulation must be comprehensible for the entity that has

the competence to take the decision, as such entity is accountable for the legality of the decision. Under the rule of law, such decisions must also be comprehensible for those subject to the decision,

and they must be justifiable in the sense of satisfying the legal norms that allow for the decision. Administrative decisions taken by code-driven regulation must thus always be contestable on

the double basis of: ‘the decision is based on legal conditions that do not apply because the system

got the facts wrong’, and ‘the decision is based on a wrong interpretation of the relevant legal :

norms’. The latter means that, even if the IFTTT standard applies, one can always appeal that this [=

code-based standard is an incorrect application of the relevant legal norm in the case at hand. :3
Data-driven regulation is informed by ALI as it integrates data-driven legal tech with code- :

driven decision systems; data-driven regulation means that the code is informed by the data DB

on which it has been trained instead of being informed by legal experts that have translated :

their insights into code [6-8]. ALI is mainly based on ‘natural language processing’, which 74

entails that algorithms are ‘trained on’ legal text, using techniques like reinforcement learning 7S

and backpropagation to mine relevant argumentations, to detect relevant preceding case law, |

statutes, treaties and doctrinal treatises or to predict the outcome of future case law.
