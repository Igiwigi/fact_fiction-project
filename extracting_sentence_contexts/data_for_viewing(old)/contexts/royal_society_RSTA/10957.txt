§ 33. The measure with which we are concerned, however, is not amplitude, but
integral energy through ranges of wave-length. Considering this, we see at once
that the short waves are all-important. The total energy of the pulse is of order E*d.
The energy contained in waves of length from infinity to dy is of order E?d. (d/A9).
Remembering that the visible spectrum includes an octave, we may say, roughly,
that yee of the energy of the radiation will reside in the visible part of the spec-
trum ; and, of the rest, practically the whole in waves of length comparable with
the diameter of the molecules. It is noteworthy that waves of length equal to the
thickness of the pulse or sub-multiples thereof will be excluded from the spectrum.

§ 34. Inequalities in the thickness of the pulses will slightly modify the features
of the equivalent spectrum. Such inequalities will arise partly from the fact that
different pulses arrive in slightly different directions; they come from different parts
of the glass (an effect diminishing with distance). Furthermore, the particles are
not stopped at a single impact in the molecules of the glass.

It also appears that, if Réntgen rays can be made powerful enough, they will
affect the eye as ordinary white light.

§ 35, Professor THoMson’s magnetic pulses are all negative. A mixture of negative
and positive pulses will present the same features except in so far as the long-waves
are concerned. If the negative and positive are present in equal quantities, the
amplitude of the infinite wave will vanish.
