The decurrent base of the leaf seems to suggest
that the leaves were not deciduous, and as a consequence effete twigs fell off with
their leaves attached as in Cryptomeria, Taxodium, and other genera now living. Affinity.â€” Notwithstanding the similarity of this fossil to Cryptomeria, we do not
forget the fact that no final decision can be reached from stems and leaves alone. The leaves are not identical with those of Cryptomeria, in the shape of both leaf and
vascular bundle, and in the large quantity of transfusion tissue, the fossil differs from
Cryptomeria, while in the living plant the lateral resin ducts die out more rapidly
than they do in the fossil, while the axis, though very similar, differs in the fossil,
having no development of stone cells in the phloem. Hence there is enough to
justify a suspicion that the fossil might prove to have fructifications which would
necessitate its removal to another genus.
