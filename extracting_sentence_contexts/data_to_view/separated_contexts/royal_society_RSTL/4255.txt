Where the diurnal inequality affects the heights s0 much, it probably affects mate-
rially the time of tide in all places, as we know it does in some. And therefore
over the whole of the Indian seas, the terms © establishment” and © tide-hour” must,
without further explanation, be very ambiguous. And as we cannot know what facts
are designated by such terms in books of navigation, all attempts to found upon
such statements a coherent view of the tides of those seas, must be very precarious*,

led to trace the progress of the diurnal inequality wave along the coast of Europe. This I attempted in the Eighth Series of these Tide Researches-F. The difficulty of
separating the diurnal from the semidiurnal wave was there in some degree overcome.
