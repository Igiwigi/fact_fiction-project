From the
equations were obtained the percentage of red and green when the white present in
each colour was included, and by the last measures the percentage of red and green
when such white was excluded. From these different percentages it was easy to
calculate the amount of blue sensation present, for it only exists in the ‘inherent
white.” On subsequently considering the sensation curves of equal stimulation as
given by Ka@nre and myself, my attention was called to the fact that at the place
where the red and blue curves cut a large and very sudden increase of white inherent
in the colour should be seen, so large indeed that it would never escape notice. The
colour at that point ought to be much paler than colours close to it, but such is not
the case. The new measures show that there is no sudden rise in the amount ot
white present in any colour, and that the maximum of white is at SSN (standard
scale number) 43 (4 5427) and not at 37°5 (A 5150).
