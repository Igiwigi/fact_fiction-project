& I this admission is made, the only ground for not regarding the ribs of Elasmo-
Ebranchii as homologous with those of Ganoids is their different position, and we have
reds attempted to prove that this is not a fundamental point. S The results of our researches appear to us, then, to leave two alternatives as to the
ribs of Fishes. One of these, which may be called Gorrr's view, may be thus stated :
—The hemal arches are homologous throughout the Pisces : in Teleostei, Ganoidei,
and Dipnoi,* the ribs, placed on the inner face of the body-wall, are serially homo-
logous with the ventral parts of the hazmal arches of the tail ; in Elasmobranchii, on
the other hand, the ribs are neither serially homologous with the hemal arches of the
tail nor homologous with the ribs of Teleostei and Ganoidei, but are outgrowbhs of

the hemal processes into the space between the dorso-lateral and ventro-lateral

* We find the 8erial homology of the ribs and ventral parts of the hemal arches to be very clear in
\f-" Cratodus, Wizversunm 8tates that it is not clear in Protopterus, although he holds that the facts aro in
— favour of this view.
