most debilitating and widespread diseases in the complex and ageing societies of the modern world. One
of the most exciting aspects of the meeting was that it brought together scientists from a wide variety of

physical, biological and medical disciplines to talk about their different perspectives on problems of
mutual interest. Just how much the recent detailed understanding of the structural basis of folding and
isfolding has enabled the common origins of many of these di *s to be recognized is testament to the

importance of such interdisciplinary activities. The fact that the meeting was oversubscribed suggests that
there is no lack of enthusiasm for interactions of this type. We strongly suspect that if another meeting
related to protein folding is held in six years time, the subject will have progressed at least as much as it
has in the past six years. We hope that the Hooke Committee, the body that decides on the topics for
future Discussion Meetings, takes careful note of this point!
