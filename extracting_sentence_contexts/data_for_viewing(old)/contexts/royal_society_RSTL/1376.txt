entertain hopes of his recovery, and had that eventually hap-
pened, I doubt much whether, even under the present uncer-
tainty of things, I could have resisted the temptation of ascrib-
ing such recovery to the reproduction of the nerves ; but the ,
event put a stop to my speculation.

I think 1 have now proved my first position, (viz.) that
whether the eighth 'pair of nerves be divided in immediate
succession, s0 as to deprive an animal of their influence sud-
denly, or whether this deprivation be effected in a more gra-
dual way, the consequences are in the end equally fatal. I must
next endeavour to avail myself of this fact in the solution of
the problem now before me. If the substance of nerve be re-
produced, certainly a period longer than the above must be
necessary for this process; but to mark the precise point of
time when the line is to be drawn, would require the sacrifice
of more animals than a question of were curiosity could jus-
tify. I must, therefore, content myself with giving a general
answer to the question, and- inquire whether, by suspending
the division of the second nerve for a much greater length of
time than was done in the two last experiments, the existence
of the animal could be preserved.
