This method was probably first employed by Kennepy*
and has since been used by Datsy, Ropertson, and others. It consists simply of
measuring by means of an extensometer, the elastic extension of a steel bar placed

| in series with the test specimen. The device
i forms, in fact, a spring balance of the greatest
stiffness that it is possible to obtain. It can be
made as sensitive as desired by refinements in
the extensometer, and it can be calibrated
readily by dead load in a testing machine. The
arrangement used by the author is shown dia-
grammatically in fig. 4.
