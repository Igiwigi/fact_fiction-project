The coefficient of regression = ‘0945.

The probable error of the correlation is ‘0193 and of the regression* ‘0195. Thus
these quantities are four to five times their probable errors, and we conclude that
fecundity is certainly inherited.

The intensity is far below that suggested by the Jaw of ancestral heredity, but it
nevertheless exists. Its lowness is probably due to the fictitious character of the
fecundity owing to the causes indicated on pp. 298-9. An attempt must now be made
to eliminate some of the factors disguising the fecundity, but to do so is by no means
so easy as in the case of fertility in man.

(iii.) My first idea was that by taking a higher limit to the number of coverings a
closer approach might be obtained to the true, i.e, the inherited fecundity.
Accordingly Table XIII. was formed for the correlation of 1000 mares and their
dams, when the minimum number of coverings was eight. But I did not recognise
that this would give far greater weight in the Table to the older mares, and that
accordingly causes (d) and (7) of p. 298 would now play a much larger part in disguising
the true fecundity than before. There appears to be no limit to the number of
times a famous old mare may go to the stallion when there is very small hope of any
