solution in our case, because both H and J, are degenerate (note that H? and J, are proportional to 1a
I). In order for non-trivial p to be diagonalizable together with H, and with Jz, it needs to have the [8
same eigenvectors as H and Jz. While our H and Jz do not commute, they are not diagonalizable in 7:8
one same basis, and if at least one of them was not degenerate, this would imply that no p (other :
than I/4) could commute with both of them. This could easily happen if we relax some conditions.
Consider, for example, another natural form of Hpjix which would just be the identity matrix Ip,
mixing |cw) and |cl) as well as |sw) and |s/). Then, the C# Hamiltonian would have four distinct
eigenvalues, +,/2 + g, where we denoted rad =2(1+ Mose - Mwin), and none of the eigenvectors is
an eigenvector of Jz, hence the only stable mixed state is I/4.

As it is the case with H and J, considered throughout the paper, we can see directly from
the form of J, that it has invariant subspaces Span(|cw) , |cl)) and Span(|sw) , |sl)), and it is easily
seen that H must be degenerate from the fact that H? is proportional to I (in effect 4;7 = (1 + 17),
following ยง5; thus, all 4,2 are identical for all four i, which leaves only two values for the four
eigenvalues A; of the Hamiltonian). Indeed, H also has two twice degenerate eigenvalues, which
allows for a choice of eigenvectors such that they would also be eigenvectors of p.

For this stationary state p, we can either directly calculate the measure of decoherence to be
0.9333, or represent p(oo) = t+ (co), where yp is a traceless operator responsible for pertaining
of coherence
