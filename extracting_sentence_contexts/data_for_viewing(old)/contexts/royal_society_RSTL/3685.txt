doubtless because it had set free some of the sulphuric acid, which, redissolving the
ferric phosphate, allowed of the formation of a small amount of the red sulpho-
cyanide.

II. A mixture of three parts of ferric citrate, and four of ferrocyanide of potas-
Sium was prepared, and divided into two equal parts. To the one there was added
a few drops of hydrochloric acid, to the other a few drops of oxalic acid. In the
one case, the ferric ferrocyanide, being insoluble in hydrochloric acid, was precipi-
tated, leaving no trace of iron in the solution; in the other case there was a blue
solution, but the whole of the iron was not in the condition of ferrie ferrocyanide,
for the addition of more prussiate of potash caused it to become bluer. That this
was due, not to the affinity of the oxalic acid for the ferric oxide, but to that of the
citric acid, will be evident from the fact ascertained by the previous experiments on
the ferrocyanide, that this result would not have been obtained had the nitrate been
employed.

IV. It is well known that if hydrosulphuric acid gas be passed through a solution
of arsenious acid in water containing a mineral acid a perfect separation of the yellow
sulphuret takes place, but if there be no free acid the solution remains yellow. The
question suggested itselfâ€”Is the whole of the arsenious and hydrosulpharic acids
converted in the latter case into sulphide of arsenic and water? In order to ascertain
this, a stream of sulphuretted hydrogen was passed through a solution of arsenious
acid in water till it was saturated, then it was allowed to stand awhile for the excess
of suIphuretted hydrogen to be dissipated, and hydrochloric acid was added. The
yellow sulphide was of course precipitated, but on repeated trials I always found
