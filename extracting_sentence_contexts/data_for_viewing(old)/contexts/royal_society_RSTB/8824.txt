that all angiosperm lineages contain multiple rounds of past genome doubling [10],
and it has long been recognized that polyploidy is an important mechanism for
hybrid speciation within contemporary plant lineages [11]. As a result of its perva-
siveness in plant evolution, polyploidy receives considerable attention in this issue,
just as it did in Leslie Gottlieb’s research.

The evolutionary shift from outcrossing to selfing is generally recognized as
one of the most frequent transitions in flowering plants [12,13]. Among many
other things, it may serve as an isolating mechanism [14-16], and indeed in
many plant lineages the origin of self-compatibility with the loss of function of
the self-incompatibility locus is associated with speciation [16-19]. In fact,
Leslie Gottlieb provided an elegant example of the association of speciation and
the transition to selfing in his classic studies in the genus Stephanomeria [20,21].
It had long been recognized that selfing species are less variable genetically at
