504 MR, J. E. PETAVEL ON THE HEAT DISSIPATED BY

The melting point of palladium calculated in this way from the formule of
CALLENDAR and GRIFFITHS was for the thermometer R, 1489°, as against 1500° as
determined by VIoLLE.

A second confirmation of the temperature determinations will be found in the fact
that in all the curves given below, the calculated temperatures agree with those
determined directly by the fusion of platinum or palladium.

Finally, it may be well to state here that although every precaution was taken to
ensure the accuracy of the results, the absolute resistance of the wires used was too
small for me to lay claim to as great a degree of precision as that obtained by
Heycock and Nevrtxe in their valuable researches on the melting point of metals.
Up to about 500° I believe the results given to be correct to a fraction of a degree,
but above 1200° it is difficult to prove that they are absolutely exact.

In Table I. will be found a determination of the volume specific resistance of
platinum and palladium. The values obtained for platinum show that the tempera-
