(iii) Thermodynamic mechanism

Qu et al. [8] gave observational support for the thermodynamic cloud response mechanism. They
performed multiple regressions of the interannual variability of low cloud cover on SST and
EIS in five subtropical stratocumulus regimes. They interpreted SST as a proxy of overall air-
sea column temperature change and used EIS to control for stability-associated cloud changes.
They found that, for fixed EIS, positive SST anomalies are associated with negative cloud cover
anomalies, consistent with the thermodynamic mechanism. They also found that, in GCMs, the
regression of simulated interannual variability of low cloud on EIS and SST in the stratocumulus : =
regions was consistent with their simulated low cloud response to twenty-first-century climate 3
change, in which there are small increases in EIS and large increases in SST. That is, their 12
observational analysis suggests that low cloud will decrease as SST warms, consistent with the ane
thermodynamic mechanism, and in fact the implied positive cloud feedback is at the upper end :
of GCM predictions for the stratocumulus regions. ne]
Qu et al. did not control for subsidence, which may alias into their regression results. Bony & DN
Dufresne [30] compared interannual cloud variability over the low-latitude oceans in GCMs with [sz
more versus less positive global cloud feedbacks. They used vertical velocity binning [7] to isolate [8
the thermodynamic cloud response of GCMs to tropics-wide temperature. Like [8] they found that ,
GCMs with stronger positive cloud feedbacks also show stronger interannual response of cloud
to tropical warming.
Qu et al.’s table 6 predicts a 5% low cloud cover decrease for a 2K SST warming. According
to their fig. 2, this corresponds to a —4Wm~* SWCRE change, which is a 10% decrease from
the climatological SWCRE in the stratocumulus regions [26]. The CGILS LESs also predict an
approximately 10% decrease in SWCRE for a 2K SST warming [18,23], albeit based on optical
depth changes in a much thicker control cloud layer with 100% cloud cover, rather than cloud
