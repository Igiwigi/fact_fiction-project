In ease (1) the second movement of 8, which follows the first movement imme-
diately, is South = 3'5 mm., West = 8'4 mm., Vertical =3°0 mm. This gives

9°0 mm. along « and 1°4 mm. at right angles to a and H/V = 3, the same as in the
first movement. The angle of impingence deduced is 57° or 73°, the ambiguity
arising from the fact that in this region of reflexion H/V has the same value for two
different angles. We cannot settle the ambiguity except by observations for different
distances, and the fact that case (2) gives e close to 60° (the minimum value of H/V
being about 2 at this point), suggests that the larger angle 73° is probably the right
one. The value from the time curve is 65°, and the discrepancy is of importance.
