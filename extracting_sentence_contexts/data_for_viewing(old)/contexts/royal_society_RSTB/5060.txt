main fork has developed and has formed more
vegetative pinne.f As in Gleichenia, the
further development of the apex of the frond
of Sphenopteris Teiliana was arrested as the
result of specialisation (here probably repro-
ductive) and developments from below resulted
in the production of the two arms. In other
specimens the fertile part may have aborted
or been suppressed, giving rise to the type of
frond without any structure in the fork (Plate
Text-Fic. 3.â€”Gleichenia circinnata, Sw. 17, fig. 15). I am, therefore, inclined to

(b) The Position of the Fructification on the Frond im some Lower
Carboniferous Plants.

In many Lower Carboniferous fern-like fronds the distinction between sterile and
fertile regions of the frond must have been well marked, but it is only in a few cases
that we have any clue as to their relative positions on the frond. Indeed, in most cases
where the difference in form of the sterile and fertile regions is great, as in Rhacopteris,
