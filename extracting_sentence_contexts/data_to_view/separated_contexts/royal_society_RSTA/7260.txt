If from this point a line is drawn through
the points near the cusp of the time-distance curve of the multiple refractions (figure 7)
its slope is such that, as would be required theoretically, it is tangential to the calculated
curves. The position of this line is also such that it passes above the first arrival points
obtained from the shots at the greater distances. If our interpretation that the velocity
gradient ceased at a velocity equivalent to that near the cusp of the curve were wrong,
and, in fact, the velocity increased to a higher value before reaching its limit, then it
would be necessary to draw a line of smaller slope passing through a point near the cusp. This line would then pass below the first arrivals obtained at the greater ranges which
would not be allowable. It would also not be possible, on this basis, to explain the single
point obtained at the shortest range.
