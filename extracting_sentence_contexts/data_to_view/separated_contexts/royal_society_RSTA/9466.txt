With a good supply of
petrol on the edges of the dises there was practically no deflection when the brushes
were in good condition. When the brushes were somewhat worn—usually after
6 runs—it was not possible to take good observations, and rather than waste time in
making indifferent measurements we preferred to wait until new brushes had been

times the thermo-electric and speed variation effects were a little troublesome, but we
