The maximum sustainable trigger frequency is ~1 KHz. This set-up was developed
specifically for our first prototype (MU-RAY), and apart from minor improvements, has not been
changed for the MURAVES project. In fact, we have already produced and tested 48 Slave boards
(plus spares) for the Vesuvius hodoscopes and the Master boards. In addition, there is a Slow Control Unit that takes care of temperature and humidity readings. This unit also drives a highly efficient Peltier cooling system developed by us (figure 8) that allows
us to operate the hodoscopes even during the hottest days by keeping the SiPM temperatures
at manageable levels.
