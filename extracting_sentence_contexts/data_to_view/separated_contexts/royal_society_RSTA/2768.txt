It has, therefore, been argued that the Jack
Hills zircons crystallized from small melt pockets within an overall mafic to ultramafic (i.e. :
not continental) crust [30-33]. In this case, the zircons themselves are not representative of that :=
bulk crust and manifest local, possibly ad hoc processes that may not provide insight into the :3
key workings of the Hadean Earth. The opposing, ‘tip of the iceberg’ viewpoint is that given :
the hostile conditions expected for the early Earth, with intense bolide bombardment, volcanic DG
resurfacing and crust-mantle overturns, the fact that any crustal relicts survived at all must mean :
that zircon-bearing Hadean crust was once voluminous (e.g. [34]). If the greater than 4 Ga detrital : 4
zircons indeed represent vestiges of granitic continents, then any inferences made from the 73
chemical inventory of these tiny grains goes to the heart of understanding Hadean crust-mantle 3
differentiation. &
Attempts to use other chemical indices to resolve these contrasting viewpoints are confounded .
by another, more fundamental issue, concerning the extent to which the greater than 4 Ga detrital
zircons faithfully preserve their primary compositional information. Disturbance to the U-Pb
isotope system has long been recognized by discordance in both U-Pb and Th-Pb ages [26] and
by variations in 2°7Pb/°Pb ages within individual grains, and even discrete growth domains
[30,35,36].
