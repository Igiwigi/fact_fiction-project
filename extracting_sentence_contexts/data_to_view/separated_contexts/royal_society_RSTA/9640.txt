Further than this, no appreciable change occurred in the value of Youneâ€™s
modulus. The increase in width of the hysteresis loop, for a given increase in the range
applied, was greatest for the case of equal and opposite stresses, and gradually
decreased in such a way as to suggest that at the maximum stress there was no
tendency to form such a loop. The ordinary tensile test only differs from this
extreme case in the fact that a short time only is allowed for fracture, whilst an
indefinitely long one would be required as an extension of the case of varying stress. This difference is unimportant, as careful experiments have shown that the rate of
test has little effect on the maximum stress obtained. The rate of permanent extension due to excess range, after the adjustment of the
elastic limits, is not so clearly shown.
