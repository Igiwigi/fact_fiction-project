We focus on the effect of increasing the uncertainty of climate sensitivity on WTP, while leaving ne]
the mean unchanged or lowering it, in §2. Section 3 interprets the second set of questions : fa
around ‘peakedness’, or a lack thereof. Section 4 concludes. An extensive set of appendices : z

2. When is good news bad? The mean-variance trade-off

A decrease in the mean climate sensitivity, other things equal, is undoubtedly good news for the
planet. We could expect eventual global average temperatures to rise less than previously feared.
However, when that decrease in mean is due to a widening of the uncertainty range—for example,
if it is due to a lowering of the lower bound—this news may not overall be good. In fact, that is
what we find may be the case here.

We first develop the general economic framework that underlies our analysis in §2a. We
represent an increase in uncertainty as a mean-preserving spread (MPS). Probability distribution
Bis an MPS of probability distribution A, if it spreads out some portions of A’s probability density
function but has the same mean as A. For example, posit that A has temperature increases of
1°C, 2°C and 3°C with likelihoods 20%, 60% and 20%, respectively. B has temperature increases
of 1°C, 1.5°C, 2°C, 2.5°C and 3°C with likelihoods 20%, 20%, 20%, 20% and 20%, respectively.
B has spread out A’s distribution around 2°C but has the same mean as A. It is thus an MPS
of A.

In §2b, we consider the impact of an MPS on the distribution of future temperatures. We
