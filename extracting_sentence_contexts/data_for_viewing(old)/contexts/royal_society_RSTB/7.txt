because the economic questions arising from their relations to our crops, &c., have
assumed such proportions as to force this group of parasites far into the foreground.
Interesting and important as are the parasitic habits of the Ustilagines, however, and
much as they have been investigated, it has to be admitted that we know as yet very
little about them. Two or three of the most common forms, it is true, have been so
often studied by different observers that they may be regarded as worked out
sufficiently to allow of our regarding them as types; but it needs no very extensive
acquaintance with the group to satisfy ourselves that the best known forms are not
the simplest, and that much still remains to be accomplished in this large group. fae
is not only that the Ustilaginese are so minute, but they are so peculiarly modified, and
so specialised as parasites, that the most careful observation is necessary in making out
the numerous points in their structure ; in addition, observers still differ considerably
as to the interpretation of some of the facts of structure which are established.

Taking the most recent systems * of classification, we may regard the Ustilaginess
as comprising the following genera, Ustilago, Tilletia, Sorosporium, Urocystis, Schizo-
nella, and Entyloma, and so far shall be in accordance with all the modern authorities ;
when we come to such genera as (7eminella, Sphacelotheca, Doassansia (Cornu), and
Graphiola (FiscHer) and some others, the matter becomes more complicated, and
special investigations are still needed to determine the limits of the genera and group.
Entyloma, however, is a well-established genus,t and now includes some fifteen or
