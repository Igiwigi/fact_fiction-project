fossiliferous slate districts, where the distortion of the fossil enables us to determine the exact position of
the line of maximum force, and consequently its relation to the plane of cleavage.

The evidence of fozsils is wanting in the conglomerate of the County of Waterford, and we are cons:
quently unable to determine the precise lines of maximum force, except 80 far as the inclination of the beds
gives us information.

Having established by obseryation the existence of conjugate systems of planes, T have drawn mechanical
inferences, founded on the asxumption of the perpendicularity of cleayage to the lines of maximum foree;
and these inferences haye not, of course, the same degree of evidence in their fayour that the geometrical
relations of the cleayage and joint planes have.

In fact, the geometrical relations of these planes are observed facts, while the mechanical inferences have
only the probability (in my opinion a high one) of the law assumed on other evidence.
