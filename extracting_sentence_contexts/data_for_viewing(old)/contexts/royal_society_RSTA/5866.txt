Now, in the presence of the above described microscopic controlled interactions, one can
consider as before the construction of a kinetic collisional equation for what concerns the


description of the formation of the social structure

< I. 9(xfie(x) dx = te lI. (2) PO) 5 (8) as] ; 217)

where we recall that the frequency of interaction has been chosen such that B(x) =1/x. Then,
thanks to the passage to the grazing limit one can show that the controlled kinetic model converges
to a Fokker—Planck type equation which contains an additional drift term, that quantifies the role
of the control mimicking lockdown measures. In fact, since by hypothesis « < 1, we can write

with % € (min(x, x), max(x, x/,)). Then using (2.16) one gets
