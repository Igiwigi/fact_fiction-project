ON COLOUR PHOTOMETRY. 437

Tt will be noticed that whereas in our curve there is a marked convexity about
scale number 485, with K that part of the curve is nmch less convex. In his paper
(Phil. Trans., vol. 150 (1860) p. 57), Prof. Cugrs Maxweir, notices the same thing
with regard to one of his observers at another part of the spectrum. Tt will, however,
be seen that in comparing K's curve with ours, the total areas are nearly the game. Tt
would appear that if the trichromatism of the normal eye be an established fact, the
slight deficiency in K's curye would be accounted for by a slight want of sensitiveness
in the curves which give the sensation of green.

$ XVI.—Colour-Blindness.

We are not aware that hitherto any direct and accurate determination has been
attempted of the relative luminosities to a colour-blind person of different parts of
the spectrum. We have been favoured by several gentlemen who have submitted to
an examination of their perceptiveness of different colours. The luminosity curves of
the electric arc light as perceived by four of these gentlemen, who are distinetly
*colour-blind,” were determined in the way above described. While at certain parts
their curves fall below ours, their maxima are considerably higher than ours. The
