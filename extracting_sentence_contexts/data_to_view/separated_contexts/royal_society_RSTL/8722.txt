As previous division of the vagi does not
seem in the least to alter the circulatory effects of poisoning by vanadium (Experiments
XLVIIL. & XLIX.), it is clear that none of these effects can be attributed to an action
on the vagi. It is, moreover, evident, from experiments detailed elsewhere in this
paper, that there is no poisoning of the muscular substance of the heart itself. Further,
the fact that vanadium does not paralyze unstriped muscles in other regions of the body
(as in the intestines) renders it probable that there is no direct action upon the muscular
walls of the arteries. We may therefore at once eliminate both these possibilities
from the question. It will be seen on comparison that the fluctuations in blood-
pressure and in pulse are only sometimes coincident ; neither will, therefore, serve as
sufficient explanation of the other, although the effects may be partially due to their
interaction.
