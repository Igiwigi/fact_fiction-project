In it, pyac(Ho) is identified with today’s VED value, Porc and «x? = 8Gn. However, in the QFT context, a more precise form for the effective coupling emerges [58]

It is apparent that veg(H) is approximately constant since it varies very slowly with the Hubble
rate. In fact, the last term of (5.11) is logarithmic and becomes quickly suppressed for increasingly
large values of H above Ho, whereas the second term furnishes (on account of In we > 1) the
dominant (and virtually constant) contribution around the current universe (H ~ Ho) and even
for a large span around it [58]:

The vanishing of veg and hence of the dynamical ~H? part of the VED is obtained only
for conformal coupling: § = 1/6. Obviously, the leading masses m involved here should come
from the heaviest fields, presumably of a grand unified theory (GUT).
