A new method employed by Thomas & Olmer (1942) furnishes the closely
confirmatory figure 14:92 at 10째C. Mercury vapour contains a small proportion of
diatomic molecules. Allowing for this fact, the heat of vaporization into free atoms at 25째 C
is calculated at the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, to be 14-66 kcal./g.-atom. *

(e) Boron

Reliable vapour-pressure data for elementary boron are almost entirely lacking. This
element melts in the range 2000 to 2075째 C (Ceuilleron 1944, 1945), and most published
estimates place the boiling-point in the range 2200 to 2550째
