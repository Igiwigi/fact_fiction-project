CORALLIAN ROCKS OF OXFORD, ETC. 158

Beginning at the base of this section, the axogyra nana beds first claim attention. The
mass of this small oyster, associated with Cidaris spines, at once suggests equivalence
with the lower parts of the Wheatley Limestones and Littlemore Clay Beds, in other
words, with the Osmington Oolite Coral Rag. In Dr. Mortey Daviesâ€™ collection there
is a good specimen of Chlamys nattheimensis, which suggests that corals were not, in
fact, far distant at the time that the Hxogyra nana lived. Beds 3, 4 and 5 also answer
well to the description of the Littlemore Clay Beds, differing only in the higher proportion
of clays to stone bands. This would give the Littlemore Clay Beds here a thickness
of about 25 ft., a reasonable comparison with Littlemore, where the thickness is
about 18 ft.
