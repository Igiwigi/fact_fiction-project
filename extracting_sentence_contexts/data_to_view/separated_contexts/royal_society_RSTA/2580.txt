instrument and in the event of being able to employ standardized anemometer-wires, the scale of the
ammeter could be graduated to read velocities directly. The galvanometer employed was a Weston portable instrument with jewel bearings and capable of
detecting a current of about 10-Â° amperes. This degree of sensitivity is more than necessary ; in fact
a millivoltmeter was found to be sufficiently sensitive for most purposes. The constants of damping are
very important in determining the rapidity with which observations can be made, and it was found that
equally sensitive galvanometers varied within wide limits in this respect. By employing an alternating
current and a telephone receiver instead of a galvanometer it was found that the same calibration curve
was obtained as in the case of direct current measurements.
