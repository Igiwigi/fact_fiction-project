The
last great news for the field, which is far from being a fringe theory, concerns the Nobel Prize for
Physics awarded to Giorgio Parisi in 2021, for his studies of disordered physical complex systems
and their fluctuations.

3. What is emergence and why does it matter? Simple systems are mostly characterized by the fact that the properties of the whole can
be understood, deduced or predicted from the analysis of their components in isolation,
their addition or their aggregation: in practice, macroscopic observables can be deduced from
microscopic ones. From this observation, it is clear that in order to characterize an emergent
phenomenon one needs at least two well separated scales—for instance defined in terms of
energy or in space and time—and one external observer able to identify meaningful patterns,
and measure them in terms of information, appearing at one scale but not at the others. Let us
consider, for instance, the mass M of composite objects like a chair, which consists of distinct
parts with a mass m; (i=1,2,...,1): the overall mass can be simply obtained by summing up the
mass of each component as M = )7; m;.
