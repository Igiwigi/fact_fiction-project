Discussion

In the past decades, various techniques were developed to accelerate quantitative MRI. One
very general way is to exploit complementary information from spatially distinct receiver
coils, called parallel imaging (PI) [55-57]. Others make use of the fact that MR images are
usually sparse in a certain transform domain and combined with incoherent sampling and
nonlinear image reconstruction algorithms it is called compressed sensing (CS) [58]. Exploiting
this prior knowledge about a compressible image, CS can recover MR images from highly
undersampled data [59,60]. Other approaches combine PI and CS with efficient non-Cartesian
sampling schemes [60].
