It appears also, that with a view of rendering the bandages
more supple in particular places, where such a condition was
required, and of obviating the inconvenience of slackness in
ome of the turns, they were daubed over in a few places
with two different substances, the one consisting of wax and
resin, the other of resin alone, both applied warm ; 0 that,
while the first served to give pliancy to some of the linen
employed, the second caused the slack and loose edges of the
bandages to adhere together, by which process the whole
was rendered compact and firm, without producing hardness. The lumps of myrrh, resin, and bituminous earth, noticed
in the abdomen, were pushed up through the enlarged aper-
ture of the anus, immeiately before the application of the
bandages, for the purposes already detailed.

The preceding explanatory description of what appears,
from the unquestionable facts collected in the course of my
inquiry, to:have been the -best, and, in my opinion, the pri-
mitive mode of preparing mummies by the ancient Egyp-
tians, differs from that found in Heroportvs, as well as from
those accounts which we read in other writers who came
after him. It does not however appear that the eminent
historian just mentioned had ever been present at the em-
balming of a mummy, or that he ever had an opportunity
of examining one of them. He 'must, therefore, like many
other travellers, have noted down what he had -collected
from hearsay, in which, amidst much that was surmised,
there was something approaching to the truth.
