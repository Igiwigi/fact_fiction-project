In terms of future projections, a way forward may be to use
observational constraints to sub-select models and model ensemble members using history
matching [49], as has recently been done in studying future Arctic sea ice decline [62]. With regard to paleo modelling, one way forward is to use data assimilation to make best use
of the sparse paleo data that are available. This requires careful determination of uncertainties
in both the paleo observations and the models, and an awareness of the fact that different
paleo proxies constrain different aspects of the overturning. It remains unclear whether insights
for paleo modelling will be helpful in determining the near-term (centennial) changes in the
AMOC [50]. As noted earlier, some of the climatic impacts of AMOC changes are mediated via the AMV,
so understanding the AMOC-AMV link is an important issue [63].
