the bottom of the cave, forming bed No. 4. As the fissures in the limestone could but
have been on the level at which these streams flowed, the valley of Brixham and its
tributaries, which then as now formed the channels of drainage of the district, must
have been from 70 to 80 feet less deep than at present.

It would seem that the stream originally entered the cave by the West Chamberf
and escaped through the north entrance, and perhaps in part through the Steep Slide
Hole—the sea-level being then probably the one marked by the old raised beach, which
would show that the land then stood about 30 feet lower than at present. After filling
the lower part of the fissures with shingle, the prolonged action of the stream wore and
expanded the upper part of them into the wider passages at present constituting the
cave, and finally nearly filled them with shingle. The lower wall-grooves (6 þ) may have
formed before the shingle had choked up the cave, when, in fact, the stream was in full
force, and the upper one (« a) at a later period, when the current was more impeded,
and when, judging from the level of the old stalagmite floor, the shingle had found an
exit through the north entrance. 'The traces of a reverse or inward dip of the wall-
grooves between the road entrance and the Steep Slide Hole may be due to the influx

of the flood-waters at a later period. During this period, when the streams were low
or dry, the cave was resorted to, on a few rare occasions, by animals to deyour their
prey ; but at this time they cannot be traced far beyond the entrance—in no case more
than 36 feet in the Reindeer Gallery, and, in the Flint-knife Gallery, to 25 feet from the
west, entrance. In the same way we recognize the restricted presence of man, in the
two flint implements found at a distance of 34 feet from the north entrance, and the
two within 7 feet of the west entrance.
