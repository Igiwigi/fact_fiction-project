From what has been stated, it will be obvious that in undertaking researches in 80
difficult a snbject as that of embryology, the mind should not be pre-occupied with
any theory. I certainly had none to establish. If I was at all prepossessed, it was in
favour of existing doctrines; and it has been in s$pite of such prepossession that fact
after fact has gradually but irresistibly compelled me to form other views. In the
following pages there will be found no speculations, as I have confined myself to a
simple delineation of appearances, and to the most obvious conclusions arising from
them. If in any points I have been mistaken, that indulgence will, I trust, be ac-
corded which may be fairly claimed in exploring one of the most hidden regions of
physiology.
