on administering pituitary extract (figs. 11, 16, 17, and 20); after having been once
thus set going the secretion was not, as a rule, again suppressed. t

The other operative procedures consisted in the insertion of artery and vein
cannulas and the inclusion of one kidney in an air-oncometer. The kidney volume
was recorded by an Albrecht piston recorder. In a few experiments the changes in
volume of a loop of intestine were also registered in a similar manner. The artery
cannula was connected with a mercurial manometer. A fine cannula was tied in

+ The urine of both ureters was collected in most cases, and no separate record was taken of the amount
flowing from each one. It is a familiar fact to those who are accustomed to this kind of experiment that
a kidney in an oncometer may yield no secretion. But in such case the total amount given off is not
materially lessened, for the untouched kidney does the work of both.

eats and rabbits into the external jugular, in dogs into the saphenous vein; to it
fitted a glass syringe of 4 ¢.c. capacity. In no instance could more than this small
amount of the Ringer solution in which the extracts were dissolved be injected,
and in many cases only 1 cc. or 2 cc, were employed. The syringe and its
contents were always warmed to the temperature of the body before use, and the
intravenous injection was performed slowly, so that from half a minute to one
