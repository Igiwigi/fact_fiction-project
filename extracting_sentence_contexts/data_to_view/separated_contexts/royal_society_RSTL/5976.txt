Supposing the ice to pursue the direction which it had previous to reaching
He fall, it would, at the end of a certain time, reach the point d *; but the ice is not
Zigid enough to do this, and the mass descends to e. Now if it be the viscosity of the
Dubstance which has carried it in a certain time from B to d, that same property ought,
Sne would think, to enable it to drop down the vertical de without breaking. But so far
-From its being able to do this, the glacier descends the slope BA as © a cascade of icy

Fiscosity of the substance. = But the case will appear much stronger when we revert to other slopes upon the Mer
EQ Glace. For example; the inclination of the glacier above VAngle is 4*: it subse-
guently descends a slope of 9? 25', and in doing s0 is 80 much fissured as to.
