statement, based on an embryological study (1898), that the “liver” is homologous
with the liver of the higher Chordata, is accepted without question. The essentially
physiological monograph of FRANz (1927b) is equally uninformative. It is, then,
evident that this alimentary system demands a complete investigation both from the
structural and functional points of view, and it has, in fact, been impossible to deal
with all the problems which have suggested themselves. In its present form the work
provides a description of the ciliary mechanisms of the post-pharyngeal regions of the
gut, together with some account of the cytology of the epithelium and of the digestive
enzymes secreted by it, and discusses in the light of this description the probable
mode of operation of the mechanisms and the function of the various parts of the
system ; in conclusion, the homology of the “‘liver’’ is discussed, and a new interpreta-
tion of this organ suggested. It is hoped to undertake in the near future a comparative
study of the cytology of the alimentary canal of the lower Chordata, and the cytological
portion of the present work is therefore not to be regarded as exhaustive.

It is a pleasure to acknowledge my indebtedness to Professor E. S. Goopricu, F.R.S.,
