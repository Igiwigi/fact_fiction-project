(6.20)

Here, we are considering the contribution to m4 from each particular value of aq(X° +aX + B). The factor of q outside the sums is to account for the fact that m4 is a sum over Ha rather
than Fg a- We run over all square-free M+aX+ pe F,[X], and also their twists X38 4 a2aX +036
(where, as before, a is any fixed non-square in F,), that give rise to that particular value of +aq. For any such pair of curves in Ha, we count how many y? = X* + Ax* + Bx + C are associated to
them using (6.15) and (6.17). Because j is odd, a, = —(—ag)/, thus resulting in (6.20) when the two
are combined.
