This fuct is brought out in the second column
of the Tables. (c.) The third fact which appears on comparing the averages is that the lengthening
of the shells occurred slightly in the shells of the second terrace ; increasingly in those
of the third and fourth ; reaching a point in the fifth terrace which is practically not
afterwards exceeded in shells found as much as 30 feet lower, though the changes in
texture, &c., had greatly progressed in these latter. Evidence will be given, moreover,
which tends to show that this lengthening of the shells is more probably due to some
other consequence of the diminished size of the lake than to the increase in saltness ;
for example, to its increasing shallowness and consequent high average temperature in
summer. Examples will be given of Cockles from lagoons both of the Aral Sea and
in Egypt, which, while differing entirely from those of these salt lakes in general
appearance, are yet like them in the proportion of length to breadth.
