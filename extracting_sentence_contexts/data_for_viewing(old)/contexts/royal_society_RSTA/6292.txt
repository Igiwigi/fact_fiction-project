(i) An ordinal representation system

Following [28, definition 2.2], we provide a very brief description of a primitive recursive ordinal
notation system for the Bachmann—Howard ordinal.

Definition 3.2. Let 2 be a ‘big’ ordinal (in fact we could have chosen aK, see [32]). We define
the sets B? (a) and ordinals We (a) by transfinite recursion on a as follows:

closure of {0, 2} under:

Be (a)=} 4,8 oF (3.1)
(E> Weal&)e<a
and
Vala) =min{p < 2: p ¢B?(a)}. (3.2)

As it turns out, W2(a) is always defined, and therefore, o(a) < 2. Furthermore, it is the case
that letting B? (a) N 2 := {a € B? (a) | w < 2}, we have B? (a) N 2 = {fh | B < Vo(a)}.
