quantum annealing. The preprocessing and postprocessing time is excluded because it is identical
in both algorithms. The time is shown as a function of the density of the event, which is the
percentage of charge particles with respect to the expected multiplicity for the HL-LHC. The
computing time for the annealer is much larger than that of the CPU, however, the annealing
time is essentially independent of the number of tracks and remains below a second and superior
to the current performance on quantum annealers for track densities 10% and larger.

A similar approach to charged particle pattern recognition on quantum annealers is pursued
in [33]. The Denbyâ€”Peterson method is adapted to perform pattern recognition by classifying
track segments. The QUBO is constructed by combining hit doublets into triplets. The terms in
the objective function depend on the angles separating the tracks and include a bias term to
favour high momentum tracks. The algorithm also exploits the fact that tracks are expected to
have originated from the beam spot. Penalties are added for bifurcated tracks in which the hits
are not aligned along a potential trajectory and for edges that are not aligned appropriately in the
plane parallel to the beam direction.

The TrackML dataset is preprocessed by dividing the event into 32 overlapping sectors in
the plane perpendicular to the beam. Hits in the barrel and the endcap of the detector are
considered. Candidate edges are selected using Gaussian kernel density estimation to determine
the probability that an edge between a pair of hits is true and then the QUBO is divided into
smaller optimization problems. The annealing is performed using the D-Wave 2X system.

Figure 5 shows the purity (a) and efficiency (b) as a function of the number of particles
per event. The performance using simulated annealing (SA) and quantum annealing (QA) is
