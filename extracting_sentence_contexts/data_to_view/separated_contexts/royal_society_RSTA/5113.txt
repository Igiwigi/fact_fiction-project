At Mz, we impose those coming
from experimental measurements of Standard Model particle masses and couplings, at Ms boundary conditions coming from
minimizing the Higgs potential are imposed, and at Mcur, theoretical boundary conditions on the supersymmetry breaking
terms are imposed (adapted from [9]). (Online version in colour.)

solutions, two with (Ms) <0, which have myo in the range 125.4-125.7 GeV. We show another
parameter point in table 1. The spectra show some notable differences between the different
solutions, illustrating the fact that the solutions are physically different, leading to the possibility
of their discrimination by collider measurements. Masses whose tree-level values depend upon
the value of 1, such as the heavier neutralino and chargino masses, show the largest differences. Other sparticle and Higgs boson masses do have small per-mille level fractional differences for
this parameter point.
