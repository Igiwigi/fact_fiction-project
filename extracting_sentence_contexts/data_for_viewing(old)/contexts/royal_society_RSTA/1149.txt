Most of the time, the impact of collision models on the stability of LBMs is investigated through
numerical simulations only, and the influence of the scaling used to compute the time step is
rarely studied which further restricts the validity of these comparative studies. Consequently,
the present work intends to study the stabilization properties of collision models, from a more
general viewpoint, by relying on the concept of linear stability analysis (LSA) which, for example,
does not depend on the time step scaling. Usually, the LSA is used to determine the linear
stability properties of a given numerical scheme for uniform base flows and assuming a periodic
simulation domain. To further include the impact of boundary conditions or grid mesh refinement
techniques, one must use more complicated methods [55,56]. In the CFD community, the LSA
is most commonly called a von Neumann (or Fourier) analysis owing to the fact that von
Neumann was among the first to study the linear stability of numerical schemes used to solve
partial differential equations [57]. Even if this analysis cannot quantify the impact of nonlinear
(de)stabilization mechanisms, it is a mandatory step to assess the good behaviour of a numerical
scheme in terms of both accuracy and robustness [57,58]. When it comes to the LBM community,
