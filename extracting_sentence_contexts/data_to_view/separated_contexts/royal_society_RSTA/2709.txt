Now, before we get down to business, let me end this opening section with the comment
that Heaviside has reminded some of his admirers of the eccentric, fictional scientist Haskel van
Manderpootz, professor of the ‘new physics’ (that is, relativity), who appeared in an hilarious
science fiction tale published 10 years after Heaviside’s death [4]. Compared to the ‘modest’ Van
Manderpootz (read Heaviside), all other physicists in the world are a mere ‘pack of jackals, eating
the crumbs of ideas that drop from [his] feast of thoughts’. This view might seem to cast Heaviside
in a less-than-flattering light, but in fact I do not believe he held that image of himself; rather, it
is a hagiographic view of the man that has gained some traction among his more enthusiastic
contemporary fans. I think a proper view of Heaviside is somewhat less grand (although perhaps
not by much).

2. Electric current and moving charges

We are, today, so used to thinking of electricity as coming in tiny little lumps called electrons that
it is difficult to realize that, not much more than 125 years ago, there was no such concept.
