Atlas (ib. figs. 8 & 9) is considerable, as is that also in the development of the mid link
and the breadth of the anterior margin of the prebasal ridge.

The antero-posterior breadth of the transverse ridges is greater in Macropus Titan
than in Sthenurus Atlas, especially at their outer 8ides (comp. figs, 13 & 5); the
longitudinal extent of the crown is relatively greater as compared with the transyerse

diameter in Macropus Titan,

In the next illustration of the mandibular characters of Macropus Titan, 80 much as
is preserved of the two rami shows the angle at which they meet to unite at the sym-

physis (Plate XXVI. fig. 9). It also shows that the comparatively loose union of the
symphysis had permitted the right ramus to glide a little forward from the left one
before they were fixed in poxition by the petrified matrix; but this correspondence with
the large living Kangaroos is more decidedly shown in the subject of fig. 11, Plate XXVI.
The right ramus of fig. 9 includes the last four molars, d 4, m1, M2, M3, and a part of
the premolar, p» (this tooth, like the crown of m 1, has suffered more from fracture
than from masticatory action). The left ramus includes the last three molars and the
hind-half of the crown of d «. The present fossil was obtained by Hexry Hucnes, Esq.,
