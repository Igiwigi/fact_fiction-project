discontinuities is not known. In some instances they may have been brought
about by a somewhat too vigorous tapping preparatory to taking a reading. Some-
times they occurred during exposure of the aneroids to atmospheric pressure. Unless
a discontinuous change were of a size considerably larger than ‘01 of an inch it
would be difficult to demonstrate its existence. It is quite possible, in fact, that all
the changes in the experimental aneroids were discontinuous. There is certainly
no clear indication of a general tendency in the zeros of these aneroids to alter in a
definite direction with age. The fact that discontinuous changes may not unlikely
arise from time to time in the zero of an aneroid, shows the absolute necessity of
periodic comparisons with a mercury barometer. :

§ 27. Apart from shift of zero, it is conceivable that secular change might occur in
at least two ways. There might exist something equivalent to gradual alteration
of elastic moduli, whereby changes of reading answering to definite pressure changes
would either increase or diminish. Quite independently, there might be change in
the qualities whereon depend the elastic after-effect, manifesting itself in the
alteration of such quantities as the sum of the differences of the descending and
ascending readings in a given pressure cycle.

To examine into the first possibility I took note of the size of the corrected errors
