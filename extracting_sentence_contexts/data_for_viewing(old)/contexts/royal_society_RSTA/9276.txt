56 A. T. PRICE: A MATHEMATICAL DISCUSSION ON THE STRUCTURE OF

the usual conditions) whose average components reduce to the same as those above ;
but we have already seen how this can be done for each of those components separately,
and in each case we have concluded that the gross displacement could be calculated
as if the material were homogeneous by using the “ apparent ” moduli for the material
in bulk. Hence, superposing these solutions, we shall obtain the same formule as for
the homogeneous case, but in which the “‘ apparent ” moduli are now, of course,
involved.

We conclude, therefore, that the existence of the annual layers does not of itself
explain the discrepancies above noted. We may also observe that the relative values
of yyy and yy,» are also not explained by this fact. For if we take p,, equal to u,,,
we find from the formule (20.3) and (20.4) that py, is greater than u,, (compare § 16),
whereas we invariably find from experiment that wry» is /ess than pyr.

§ 21. Effect of Cellular Structure on Moduli of Rigidity.—For all woods that have been
tested adequately it appears that prx > eur > per: the ratios of these moduli vary
considerably, but py» is always much less than the others (compare the table in § 2).
A reason for these facts is to be found in the cellular structure of wood, which we have
already briefly described. ‘Thus pyr is less than yyy or pyr because it relates to strains
which involve distortion of the cross-sections of the longitudinal cells, whereas the other
moduli are concerned with the longitudinal shearing of these cells. In a similar way
vir is less than py, because an LT-plane contains the cross-sections of the cells of the
medullary rays, while an LR-plane contains the longitudinal sections of these cells.
