Experiments 8 and 9. The same phaznomenon. took. place,
when an infusjon of litmus was brought into contact with a
mixture of common air and -muriatic acid, and of oxygenous gas
and muriatic acid, after electrization in this instrument ; oxyge-
nated muriatic acid being produced in both cases. The above facts prove, that the combination of oxygen with
muriatic acid, in these experiments, is not occasioned by a pre-
disposing affinity in the mercury to combine with oxygenated
muriatic acid ; but that the electric fluid serves actually as an
intermedium, in combining the muriatic acid with oxygen. From the relation of these experiments it appears, that not
the smallest progress had been made by them, towards the de-
composition of the muriatic acid. 1 resolved, - therefore, to
attempt its analysis, in a similar manner, with the aid of com-
bustible gases. |

Effects of electrifying the Muriatic Acid Gas with inflammable
Substances. |

In a memoir read before the Royal Society, and inserted in
their Transactions for 1797, 1 have shewn, that when electrical

shocks are passed repeatedly through a confined portion of car-
bonated hydrogenous gas, the water held in solution by the
gas, is decomposed by the carbon, which forms a constituent
part of it; that carbonic acid is formed; and an addition made,
of hydrogenous gas. Hence, the bulk of the carbonated hydro-
gen gas is considerably enlarged by this process; which shews,
by its results, that the affinity of carbon for oxygen, is rendered
much more powerful and efficient by the electric fluid.
