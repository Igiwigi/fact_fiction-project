And,

4thly. It was proved, that a certain portion of carbonate of
lime enters the composition of bones in general ; the proportion
of it however being, to the phosphate of lime, vice versd to that
observed in the crustaceous marine substances. Upon the view, therefore, of these facts, it is evident, that
there is a great similarity in the construction of shell and bone;
and that there is even an approximation in the nature of their
composition, by the intermediate crustaceous substances. These remarks, with the experiments by which they are
supported, form the principal features of that paper, which the
Royal Society honoured with a place in the last volume of
the Philosophical Transactions, At that time, it was not my

intention immediately to pursue the subject; but I changed this
resolution, after a conversation with my friend Dr. Gray, Sec.
R.S. who suggested, that many marine substances still remained
to be examined in a similar manner ; and that a series of expe-
riments on Zoophytes (hitherto but little known in respect to
their component parts) would be very interesting, and might
probably lead to some improvement in their classification.
