bited by different Voltaic combinations.

Believing that our philosophical systems are exceedingly
imperfect, I never attached much importance to this hypo-
thesis ; but having formed it after a copious induction of
facts, and having gained immediately by the application of it
a number of practical results, and considering myself as
much the author of it as I was of the decomposition of the
alkalies, and having developed it in an elementary work, as
far as the present state of chemistry seemed to allow, I have
never criticised or examined the manner in which different
authors have adopted or explained it,â€”contented, if in the
hands of others' it assisted the arrangements of chemistry or
mineralogy, or became an instrument of discovery. And
having now given what I believe to be a faithful sketch of its
origin, I shall not enter into an examination of those works
which have induced me to make this sketch, and which con-
tain partial or loose statements on the subject, and which
