Aramoniacal falt of lemons,

* By true neutral ſalt is meant, a ſalt made with an acid and
one of the three alkalies; the word tre is added to theſe ſalts,
to diſtinguiſh them from neutral ſalts, made with carths or me-
tals, and acids,

By means of , theſe neutral falts-we'may be ena-
bled to diſcover many of the properties of vegetable
acids, and particularly the different degrees of afli-
nity or attraction between them and alkaline falts;
thus, for example, if we diſſolve in water ſome of
the neutral ſalt of currants, and add ſome lime juice
or ſome vinegar, and then, evaporate and cryſtal-
lize: if we obtain a neutral falt of: currants, we
conclude that the acid of currants has a greater afti=
nity or attraction to. the alkali than the acid of
limes or of vinegar; but, if we get a neutral falt of
limes, or of vinegar, we conclude that theſe acids
haye a greater aflinity with the alkali than rhe juice
of currants,

As I am ſenſible that this account of vegetable
neutral ſalts is very incomplete, and that I have
done little more than given a very ſuperficial deſcrip-
tion of their external appearance; and as it will
probably require. a.length of time, and the labours
of many, to diſcover fully their virtues and proper-
ties, I ſhall recommend it to thoſe, who may pro-
fecute this ſubject to, endeavour to aſcertain the fol-
lowing facts :

1. What degree of cold or of heat is generated on
the mixture. of each acid with the different alka-
line falts;. and likewiſe to try. the ſame experiment
with each neutral ſalt at the time of its ſolution in
water.

2. What quantity of pure, alkaline. falt-it takes
to ſaturate any determined;quantity of each” of the
vegetable acids,

3., What figure each neutral falt aſſumes whenit
is firſt cryſtalliſed, and likewiſe after it -has/ been

purified,
