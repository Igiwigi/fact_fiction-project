_ If further, the bodily forces be derivable from a potential function V, so that
X=aV/dx, Y=oaVjay, Z=oVje . .... . (3),

on substituting the values (2), (3), in (1), we obtain

the equations (4), (5), which are the rigorous equations for the vibrations of a
THtating, incompressible, elastic solid, are theoretically sufficient to determine w, v, w, wf,
yject to certain boundary conditions. Eliminating v, u in turn from the first two
equations (4), we obtain

Applying the operators 0/dx, 0/oy, and making use of (5),

[ (nv _ ay + 40 fai De = (nv? — =) (ae + aan

Hence, on eliminating w by means of the third of (4), we obtain the following
equation for yb :—
