mental (, ¢) curves is rather better when the effect of the strength of the bullet is taken into
account, There is still considerable discrepancy in the later stages of the impact, where the
assumption that the stress system in the bullet is one-dimensional undoubtedly breaks down.
This is clearly shown to be the case by examining the residue of the bullets after impact.

In one experiment, with a bullet moving at 741 ft./sec., the weight of the residue was found
to be about one-third of the weight of the bullet, whereas the theory used here shows that

the ratio should be 0-0014; the diameter of the residue was about 0-375 in. compared with
0-22in. for the bullet. These facts indicate that Hopkinson’s theory of the effect of the
strength of a bullet on the force which it exerts needs modification in the light of recent work
on the propagation of plastic waves.

The curves shown in figure 12 satisfy the momentum relationships, since the value

of [pdt taken over the duration of the pulse is 12-0 x 10°g./cm.sec. when evaluated

from the experimental (/, /) curve and 11-9 x 10% g./cm.sec. when evaluated from the
theoretical (/, ¢) curve, after allowance has been made for the finite strength of the bullet.
From equation (5-12), the integral should be equal to dpeoé which has here the value
12-3 x 10° g./cm.sec.
