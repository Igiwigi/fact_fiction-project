In defence of the interactive brain hypothesis
(E.D.P. and H.D.J.)

Let us consider the IBH at its most radical: the claim that the
dynamics of social interaction play constitutive roles in social
cognition. The developmental version seems less controver-
sial, although its implications are not trivial (see e.g. [15]). In fact, for any environmental factor to developmentally
shape the function of brain processes, it cannot be systemati-
cally just an informational input. To play an informational
role strictly requires the stationary functional context of the
system for which a signal serves as an input. Hence, the
developmental IBH also necessitates the possibility of inter-
action dynamics playing more than just informational roles.
