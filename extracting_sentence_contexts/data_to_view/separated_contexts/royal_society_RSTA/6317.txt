This is not a problem so long as this gradient is available, but it
significantly limits the conditions in which they can be sustained. Second, the particular dynamical regularities they exhibit are entirely a consequence of the
gradient that drives them and their material constituents. Although the term ‘self’ in self-
organization refers to the fact that the particular forms produced are not imposed from the
outside, neither are they imposed internally. They result from the interaction of internal material
constraints and the form of external perturbation. There is no individual ‘self’ that is the source
of this effect.
