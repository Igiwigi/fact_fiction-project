is roughened by numerous closely placed, very minute, blunt points. These are
placed on an outer hyaline layer (the extine), which is sometimes seen extending as
a colourless band beyond the underlying denser yellow layer (the intine). ‘The
spores are provided with a distinct triradiate ridge, Plate 25, figs. 15 and 16, Plate 26,
figs. 28 and 29, though this is often difficult to see on account of the crumpling of
the spore wall. Its presence indicates that the microspores are tetrahedrally
developed.

It will be seen from the foregoing description of the microsporangia of Crossotheca
Héninghausi—the Lyginodendron Oldhamium of WitttAmMson—that they differ
from the microsporangia, described by Miss Benson under the name of Zelangium
Scotti,* and which some have thought were the microsporangia of Lyginodendron.
T cannot help thinking that this opinion has been somewhat supported by the fact

that Srur placed Sphenopteris Hininghausi in his genus Calymmotheca, but he did
so without the slightest knowledge of its fructification.

The microsporangia of Crossotheca Hininghausi are distinguished from those of
Telangium Scotti by the following differences, which are shown underneath in tabular
