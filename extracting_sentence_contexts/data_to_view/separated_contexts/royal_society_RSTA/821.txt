I am indebted to Mr H. O. Hartley for these values. Thus with laws practically indistinguishable observationally from the normal law the
the parameters will differ

appropriate treatments of the data to give estimates o
drastically. This fact makes it all the more necessary that we should try to find out
what the law of error really is. The use of the normal law as an approximation, when the actual error
ofseveral comparable components, does not rest, therefore, on the artificâ€™
of one of those limiting processes that delight the hearts of mathematicians. It is not
necessary that the number of components should be infinite.
