The accuracy of quantification by amplicon sequencing
was evaluated. The results from the two loci—ospC and rrs-
rrlA _IGS—were compared and found to be very similar. In
this analysis, we took advantage of the fact that B. afzelii
(like B. burgdorferi; [23,24]) has a highly clonal genetic struc-
ture so that ospC and rrs-rrlA IGS are in strong LD,
especially within populations [13,19]. A previous study
showed that among the ospC and rrs-rrlA IGS alleles detected
in this study, there are five ospC alleles that can be expected
to be in perfect LD (LD = 1) with a single rrs-rrlA IGS allele
at our main study site at Kalvs mosse, Revingehed (ospC
1-rrs-rrlA IGS 1, 2-2, 4-4, 7-11 and 9-9; cf. fig. 1d,e in
[13]). An ANCOVA with infection intensity of a given ospC
as dependent variable (calculated as the proportion of reads
of that ospC allele times the overall B. afzelii infection intensity
as measured by qPCR), infection intensity of the correspond-
ing rrs-rrlA IGS as covariate, ospC—rrs-rrlA IGS linkage
group as factor, and the interaction between linkage group
and the covariate, showed the infection intensity of a strain
as measured by ospC and rrs-rrlA IGS to be strongly correlated
(Fi,224 = 391, p< 0.0001, Pearson r= 0.86), and that there
was no difference in intercepts or slopes between the different
linkage groups (ospC—rrs-rrlA IGS linkage group: F424 =
0.89, p=0.47; ospC—rrs-rrlA IGS linkage group x rrs-rrlA
IGS infection intensity: F42.4= 1.43, p=0.22; figure 1).
