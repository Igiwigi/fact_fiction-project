paths correspond expressions of f in terms of the Grébner bases we have been considering. We
have

El: f=(y—1)g1+(° -/)g2
E2:f =—(x+1)g1 + Ro.

(The first expression E1 corresponds to the paths on the left of the triangular blank cell and the
second expression E2 to the paths on the right of that cell).
Consider the path around the blank cell, as in figure 4. We get

O=(x +91 —YR0-

In fact, if we consider the two paths mentioned before and we subtract the corresponding
expressions, we get exactly the same result.

Thus, we have that the pair (x + y, -y>) are coordinates of zero with respect to g, and g2. Now,
from E1 we have that (y — 1, y* — y®) are coordinates of f, with respect to g1 and g7, and from E2
we obtain (—(x + 1),y’). Thus, in terms of g and g9, the coordinates of El and of E2 are the same
modulo (x + y, —y°). Hence, we say that El and E2 are the same modulo (x + y, —y°). Therefore,

as these expressions corresponded to some paths, we have that these paths are the same modulo
(w+y,-y).
