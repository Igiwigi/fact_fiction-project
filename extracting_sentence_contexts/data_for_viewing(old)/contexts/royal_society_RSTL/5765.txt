sibly directed by the poles. Hence the two magnetic axes, QQ and Q'Q', of formiate

of copper, lie in the symmetric plane, including an angle of about 50?, bisected by the
above determined axis of greatest induction (@).

Il. On finite ellipsoids influenced by an infinitely distant pole.

22. We have shown that a natural prism of ferrideyanide of potassium, for instance,
oscillating between the two poles of a magnet, is kept by them in a fixed position,
dependent solely upon the direction of its crystallographic axes with regard to the axis
of suspension. It will invariably retain the same position, whatever part we may take
away from it, whatever the shape of the remaining fragment may become. From this
fact we may conclude that, in the case of this salt, the particles of the influenced crystal
do not act sensibly on each other, and hence deduce that the direction of the whole
mass of the crystal is plainly defined by the action upon a single one of its molecular
particles. According to the above-described experiments, we may infer too, that such @
particle is acted upon like a certain amorphous ellipsoid consisting of the substance
the crystal. Again, the action of a magnetic pole upon a single molecule is throughout
