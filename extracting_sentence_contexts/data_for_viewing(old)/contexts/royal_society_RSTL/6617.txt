—B,—2Br —3Ba* —4Bx* +&c. )
and consequently
B,=A,; B,=A,+ZA;B, ; B,= A,+2A,B, +ZA.B,;
B,=A,+ZA,B,+$A,B,+4AB,; B,=A;+4ZA,B, +$A,B;+ZA,B,+4A,B, &c.,
where B,, B,, B,, &c. are found respectively one after the other by a very simple law ;

and this method may also, if many terms be thought requisite, be preferable to the first
method, and the equation reversed would give

A,=B,, A;z=B,—{4A,B,, A,=B,—ZA,B,—{A,B,, A,=B,—$A,B, —$A,B,—1A,B,, &c.

N.B. The calculations which these sheets required were laborious, and necessitated the very frequent, in
fact the continual use of a table of Logarithms, and the searching for the Anti-logarithms; and I feel
pleasure in stating that T found the last edition of Anti-logarithms, published by Mr, H. BE. Fiirrowssy, a
very serviceable assistance, and I have no doubt that calculators in the same path must be glad to possess
these Tables.
