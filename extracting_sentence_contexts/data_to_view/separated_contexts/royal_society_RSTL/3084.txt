10.) be the section of a plate of any dielectric, a and 6 being the
metallic coatings ; let b be uninsulated, and @ be charged positively ; after ten or fif-
teen minutes, if @ and b be discharged, insulated, and immediately examined, no elec-
tricity will appear in them ; but in a short time, upon a second examination, they will
appear charged in the same way, though not to the same degree, as they were at first. Now suppose that a portion of the positive force has, under the coercing influence of
all the forces concerned, penetrated the dielectric and taken up its place at the line p,
a corresponding portion of the negative force having also assumed its position at the
line ; that in fact the electric at these two parts has become charged positive and
negative; then it is clear that the induction of these two forces will be much greater
one towards the other, and less in an external direction, now that they are at the
small distance » p from each other, than when they were at the larger interyal @ b. Then let @ and b be discharged; the discharge destroys or neutralizes all external
induction, and the coatings are therefore found by the carrier ball unelectrified ; but
it also removes almost the whole of the forces by which the electric charge was driven
into the dielectric, and though probably a part goes forward in its passage and termi--
nates in what we call discharge, the greater portion returns on its course to the sur-
faces of c, and consequently to the conductors @ and b, and constitutes the recharge
observed.
