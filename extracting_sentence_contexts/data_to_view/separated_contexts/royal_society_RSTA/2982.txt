and ©,'/0,' from the observations, and we find in
this 0°6 and 0°8 respectively, or values between two and three times as great as those
calculated from the assumed law of conductivity. To explain the difference we might imagine some cumulative effect, so that in
midsummer the conduction would be greater than in winter even for the same elevation
of the sun, but our present knowledge does not justify us in assuming this to be the
case. I am inclined, therefore, to consider that the cause of the discrepancy lies
in the fact that, as already suggested in the introductory remarks, the oscillations
responsible for the barometric and magnetic phenomena are to some extent independent
of each other, affecting different layers of the atmosphere. There are theoretical
reasons why this should be so. It is now, I think, generally recognised that the
importance of the semidiurnal variation of the barometer is due to the fact that the
free period of the atmospheric oscillation, dependent on the velocity potential y,*, is
very nearly equal to 12 hours.
