(a) Analytical treatments

Giving the best description of living tissues in morphogenesis is an ambitious objective.
Considering mostly the scale of organs or embryos, the continuum description is preferred, at
least in the biomechanics community. However, living tissues present a diversity of behaviours
that inert physical systems do not exhibit. In physical systems, volumetric growth is not so
common. Swelling or drying gels, although very useful tools for mimicking growth with
adaptable geometries do not fully correspond to volumetric growth or resorption. In physical
situations with inert matter, growth is very often the result of an out-of-equilibrium phase
transition process such as dendritic growth. This process is governed by diffusion equations
and elasticity plays a minor role. It is why the theory of elasticity with growth [5] has been so
much debated. In addition, the fact that all geometric deformations have the scale of the samples
indicate that the theorist cannot use linear elasticity. After two decades of discussions about the
foundations of the modelling, the time has come to test the model in the full complexity of living
systems, addressing their dynamics and disorders. Four up-to-date biological systems have been
presented here where cells play a key role. Cells are the sole sources in the systems through
their proliferation and their ability to generate new connective tissues. They also power other
deformations, such as stretching via their actomyosin network. Finite elasticity allows analytical
treatments when the shape result from bifurcations. However, when the study concerns extremely
active cells embedded into a fibrous tissue, microscopic methods or semi-microscopic methods
may be preferred.
