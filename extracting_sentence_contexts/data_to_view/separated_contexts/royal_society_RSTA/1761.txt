The fundamental equation expressing in its most concise form the energy principle

for the electromagnetic field can be written in the form

wherein W and T are respectively the potential and kinetic energies inside any
volume bounded by the closed surface f in the field, F is the rate of dissipation of
electromagnetic energy into energy of other types such, for instance, as results
mainly from the inertia of the electric charges constituting the conduction and
convection currents; and § is the vector determining the flow of electromagnetic
energy outwards over the bounding surface. In this equation it is generally assumed that our knowledge of the forms of F and
W is precise and accurate, and that in fact in agreement with the results of
