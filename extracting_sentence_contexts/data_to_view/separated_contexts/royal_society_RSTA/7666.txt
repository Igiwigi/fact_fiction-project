The condition that h/|7,| is >y

implies, for instance, that for wave-lengths in the range 2-10 m. /should be greater than,
say, 500 m. Thus, provided we are far enough from the transmitter to be able to fulfil
this condition, we get a simple physical picture of a process of diffraction followed by
an unattenuated path out into space, analogous to the picture one would expect from
ordinary optical theory. But the important point emerges that the process is referred not to the curved surface
of the earth, but to a fictitious sphere of radius | 7, | somewhat greater than the radius of
the earth. This point is obscured in ordinary optical theory because | 7; | is then so nearly

equal to 7, but with ultra-short waves the wave-length has become long enough for
|7, | to have a very important physical significance. This picture allows us to express an approximate relation between the height of the
receiver above | r, | and the decibel gain in signal strength produced by raising it to this
height from |7,|.
