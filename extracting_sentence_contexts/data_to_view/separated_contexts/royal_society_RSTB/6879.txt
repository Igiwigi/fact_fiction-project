W. WARDLAW ON THE SHOOT APEX OF DRYOPTERIS 361

(and figure 82, plate 10): the very extensive development of vascular tissue in the leaf-base,
consisting of a broad curved ribbon encircling the leaf-trace strands and becoming incom-
pletely conjoined with some of them, relates to two buds. Lower down the mass of vascular
tissue diminishes greatly, till finally (figure 40) it can be seen that two bud steles are in
fact involved: that on the left, belonging to the younger and larger bud, becomes confluent
with the shoot stele at the level of the section illustrated in figure 40; the other, a small,
non-medullated protostele typical of the normal development, becomes confluent with the
shoot stele at a point of meristele conjunction lower down.
