Figure 13. Oscillating regime for the shear rate at constant applied stress, o , = 120 Pa, for different magnetic fields. Volume
fraction of carbonyl iron & = 62%. (Online version in colour.)

where we have increased the magnetic field step by step, keeping the applied stress constant,
always at a volume fraction of 62%. The oscillations of the shear rate quickly decrease when we
increase the field and their frequency increases. Then, their shape becomes more irregular (black
line with crosses) and finally, above 10kA m!, they have totally disappeared (solid horizontal
green line).

In fact, as shown in figure 6, when we increase the magnetic field, we also increase the
critical stress above which the instability appears. It is then understandable that, if we apply
a constant stress (here 120 Pa) and increase the magnetic field, the critical stress will go above
the applied one and we shall fall inside the stable region, so the instability will disappear.
Nevertheless, if we apply the model described above by increasing progressively the critical
stress between 100 Pa (the critical stress in the absence of the field) and 120 Pa to represent the
effect of the magnetic field, we do not observe the same behaviour as that described in figure 13:
the amplitude and the frequency of oscillations remain practically constant until a critical stress
of 119.5 Pa is reached, at which the oscillations suddenly disappear. Once again, it appears that
the description of the evolution of the viscosity with stress (equations (2.1), (2.2) and (2.4)) is
not well adapted to systems where the fraction of frictional contacts varies abruptly with the
stress.
