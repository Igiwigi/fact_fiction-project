Hence | z/w’ | <1+Cd—3k-. (123) As & is an absolute constant, it follows from (115) and (123) that if 0 is sufficiently small
a | @+y?)2|<1-d,

where 4, is a positive absolute constant. Also, from (123) and the fact that o’ = ¢-’, where ¢> 1 and r satisfies (122), it is clear that
|z|<1 if 0 is sufficiently small. Case 2. Suppose that p, and p, do not satisfy (111).
