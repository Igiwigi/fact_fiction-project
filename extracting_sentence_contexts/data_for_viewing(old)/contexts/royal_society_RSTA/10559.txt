this results from the fact that the particles of which the nebula is composed are
physically indistinguishable. This very fact, however, introduces a further complica-
tion into the question. It will be noticed that, although the value of € has been
found at every point of the nebula, it is impossible to determine the separate values
of Aand B. On the other hand, the physical vibration must have’ a definite limiting
form when p= 0. Now it is easy to see that a motion of the gas in which
€ vanishes at every point of the gas, and in which A and B vanish separately at the

boundary, will, in every configuration of the gas, satisfy our equations with p = 0.
Such a motion, in fact, simply leads to a configuration which is physically
indistinguishable from the initial configuration, and in which the potential energy
remains unaltered. The motion which we have found from our equations is the sum
of a motion of this kind, and a true limiting vibration. It is impossible to separate
the two motions, except by considering vibrations of frequency different from zero,
but fortunately the question is not one of any importance.

§ 21. Let us now attempt to form the final equation in some cases of interest. The
equations of an isothermal nebula at rest under its own gravitation have been
discussed by Professor Darwiy.* Our function u (equation 54) is given, in the case
in which the nebula is isothermal, by the equation
