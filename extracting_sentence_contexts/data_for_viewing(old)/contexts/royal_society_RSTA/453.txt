increased and subsequently decreased respiratory frequency (peak-like behaviour). These results
might come from the changed HR regulation in the REL group that was proved in different
studies where the REL group revealed a comparable pattern of reduced HRV to that in the SZO
group. The mean value of invariable HR pattern (BBI-E1, 5.1 + 7.4) of the REL group was closer to
that of the CON group (3.0 + 3.9), leading to no significant (but in trend) differences between these
groups, but were further away from the mean values of the SZO group (15.4 + 17.2), leading to
this significant difference; this seems to be mainly the result of the altered HRV in the REL group
and not of respiratory variability. However, we would like to especially emphasize that the REL
group have fast alterations of increased and subsequently decreased (RESP-P) and alternating
(RESP-LA1) respiratory frequency. This result may be due to the fact that the measurement
procedure is stressful for the REL group or that they were worried about their diseased relatives
(SZO) who require comprehensive clinical treatment.
