loops of the tRNAs on the small subunit from A to P and P (a) Overcoming heterogeneity
to E, respectively, together with the advance of the
mRNA bound to the tRNAs by one codon. The precise func-
tion of GTP hydrolysis on EF-G/eEF2 in this process is
still controversial, and it may not be strictly coupled with
the second stage of translocation [32]. Heterogeneity stems from the fact that often multiple states of
the molecule are present, all differing in structure, so that a
reconstruction from all projections will be a blurred super-
position of several structures, representative of none. As a
remedy, it is possible to use antibiotics or non-hydrolysable
GTP analogues to trap the molecule in particular states. Antibiotics are typically small molecules that bind to a func-
tional centre and disable its dynamical features [33].
