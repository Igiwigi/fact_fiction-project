core member of the human breast milk microbiome [63].
Interestingly, microbial communities characterized by high

pathogens (figure 1b).

Additional host factors plausibly involved in shaping the
local ecosystem occur in the mucus layer that forms a phys-
ical barrier and segregates resident bacterial flora in the
nasopharyngeal lumen from the epithelial cell surface. The
central purpose of this barrier is to limit contact between
