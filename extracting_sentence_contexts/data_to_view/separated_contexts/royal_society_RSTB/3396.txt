In view of the fact that fertilisation occurs
within the male cytoplasm, it becomes especially important to distinguish the one
from the other. In well-fixed material the female nucleus is approximately spherical
in form and its nucleolus is almost invariably smaller than that of the tube-nucleus. More important, however, is the fact that before contact between the two tubes is
elfected the tube-nucleus is either already absorbed or at least shows very distinct
signs of deterioration. Occasionally, however, undoubted female nuclei have been
seen which very closely resemble a common form of the tube-nucleus (ef: figs. 29
and 46).
