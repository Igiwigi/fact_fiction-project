organ and Stravinsky’s Rite of spring. Pigeons were trained to respond to the
left disc during Bach, and a right disc during Stravinsky excerpts. With time,
the pigeons learned this discrimination. Once the pigeons were making few
errors, they were presented with novel excerpts from the same composers,
and similar excerpts from other composers. The pigeons generalized to all of
these novel stimuli through their responses to the two choice discs in a way
that mirrored that of human participants.

A more recent study was performed using a similar operant paradigm with
carp (Cyprinus carpio) using blues and classical stimuli and found comparable
results [3]; after initial training with a small set of blues and classical music
stimuli, carp were able to correctly classify stimuli from these genres that
they had never heard before. How can we interpret the fact that distantly

categorization of such complex auditory stimuli? Moreover,
what can we learn from such studies?
