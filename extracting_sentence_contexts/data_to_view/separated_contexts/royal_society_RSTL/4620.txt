He writes, —* The
= last cervical and the six first dorsals have their articular processes joined together by
i= horizontal facets, of which the anterior looks upwards. At the sixth they begin to
- be oblique, at the seventh they are nearly vertical, the anterior looking inwards*.”
SZ But in the figure which he refers to, of the fourth dorsal vertebra of the Delphinus
S Delphis, the accurate artist, M. LauRLLarD, represents the metapophyses as distinct
5 from the prozygapophysis or anterior articular process, although less $0 than it is in
[4 nature; and it is incontestably the progressive development of this superadded pro-

cess which gives rise to the change of position of the articular surface of the connate
prozygapophysis: and the metapophysis continues to be developed, as the figures in
the © Ossemens Fossiles' demonstrate, long after the articular process or any articular
surface has ceased to existf.

740 PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE MEGATHERIUM. Order BrvuTa (Edentata, Cvuv.). The exogenous processes of the vertebre present their greatest and most complex
developments in this order, but by no means with that degree of uniformity which
renders their modifications characteristic of some of the preceding Orders.
