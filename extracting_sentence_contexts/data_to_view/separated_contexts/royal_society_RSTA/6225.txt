The
schematic of the way this and other models can be derived from statistical mechanical concepts


and the idea of representing the polymer network through a number of representative chains
show that these models share the same essential steps in their development. Although they
can thus be categorized into the same large family of models, there are very few known close
relatives that differ from the statistical version of Ogden’s model only in a single step. In fact, we
have discovered only one such model, viz. the strain-energy density function (5.15), which is a
special case of the hyperelastic constitutive equations proposed in [87,88]. A main reason for this special position of Ogden’s model is the relaxation of the affine
assumption through a power law. In general, this operation turns out to be beneficial since nearly
all variations containing this step have shown very sound agreement with the experimental
dataset.
