white, probably 8, separating the @ and the enclosed patch of B, yet the latter is
patternless and, as usual with a ferric chloride etch, darker than the « surrounding it.
This should be contrasted with the patch of the C’ complex taken from the alloy
chilled at 470° and also etched with ferric chloride, fig. 19. Here we see that the
border of 8 has become very wide and that the interior of what was the patch of 8
has broken up into a complex of 8 and a copper-rich body which so closely resembles
a that we give it the same name. These two photographs were both taken at a
magnification of 280 diameters.

This transformation 8 = « + 6 is an exothermic one, and gives rise to the halt in
the cooling curve that we first see in our cooling curve of Sn 10 at 500°, though, as
we have shown (fig. 13), the same transformation can be detected by the microscope
even in Sn 6. In fact, this change of solid 8 into a complex occurs at or a little below
500° in all alloys from Sn 6 to Sn 20, It is marked in our diagram (Plate 11) by the
broken line b’C’/XD,. It must be borne in mind that at this temperature the alloys
are rigid solids.

Sn 12. 20°3 per cent. by weight of tin.

The solidification of this alloy begins, as in the cases already discussed, by the
crystallisation of « combs, but when these cease to form, on account of the residual
liquid having reached the C composition, there is much more of the liquid than in the
ease of Sn 9, and hence the 7¢-solution of the « during the transformation at the C
temperature is more marked. This is well seen in the cooling curve of Sn 12, in
which the C halt is a prolonged one, but it is made evident in another way by an
