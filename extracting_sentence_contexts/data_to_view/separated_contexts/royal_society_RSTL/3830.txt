It appears, therefore, not improper to
class these irregularities with those others of accidental occurrence which occasion
small discordances in partial results, and are usually ranged under the general
technical head of errors of observation. If, further, we compare generally the deviations in 1840 with those of April 1841,
the latter appear systematically rather the more considerable in amount. Viewed as
a single fact, this cireumstance might be regarded simply as indicating that some
change had taken place in the interim in the arrangement and distribution of the
ship's iron, and an easy and natural explanation might appear to be afforded. It is
however one of several facts which have presented themselves in the course of a care-
ful examination of the observations of the first two years of Captain Ross's expedition,
which seem to point to the possibility of a somewhat different cause, viz. that when

a ship changes her magnetic latitude, the corresponding change in the magnetism of
the ship, or more strictly in that portion of it which is derived from induction, fol-
lows, but does not always, or altogether, take place instantaneously. It would accord
with this supposition, that the disturbance of the compass should be less in the
Erebus on her first arrival at Hobarton in 1840, than on her return there in 1841,
becanse in 1840 $she had recently passed through the lowest magnetic latitudes, and
in 1841 she came immediately from the highest.
