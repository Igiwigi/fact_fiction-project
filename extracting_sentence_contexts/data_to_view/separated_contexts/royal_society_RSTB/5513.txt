This is well demonstrated in
Prof. Wiuson’s transverse Weigert series. Although some of these fibres appear to
fray out within that nucleus, others of these undoubtedly pass through. ‘This apparent

with the lateral lemniscus, would be, if proven true, a very suggestive fact for the
phylogenetic development of that body. The lateral lemniscus (/em.l., fig. 17) passes dorsal to or through the nucleus ventralis,
or the seventh motor nucleus, as well as through the superior olive. It then turns
dorso-laterally in a curve convex to the brain wall, and swings dorsalward to the mid-
brain.
