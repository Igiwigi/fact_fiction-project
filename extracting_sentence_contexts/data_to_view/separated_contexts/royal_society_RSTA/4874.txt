(ut Va 1 008) It will appear from what we have shown in Arts, 33-36, that this definition is not a
valid one, as the function given by the definite integral for values of » with a negative
real part is not the analytical continuation of the function given by the same definite
integral for values of yw with a positive real part ; it follows that P, (u) can be defined
by the above expression only for values of » with a positive real part. The fact that the definite integral is of ambiguous meaning at the imaginary p axis
is clear if we attend to the phases of the integrand (1 + ./,? — 1 cos )", or h"; » being
purely imaginary there is a value of between 0 and a for which h vanishes, and in
passing through this value of w the phase of the integrand changes by a finite amount. The / integral in Art.
