contained in a real seed but in a gall-like growth replacing this. For further particulars on this subject

> 25, Paris, 1769); in this belief he was for a time followed by Nzzprax. Both Oxex and Ruporent (Grundr.
ler Physiolog. 8vo, 1821-27) deny the fact of the revival of animals after desiccation, whilst Bozr ds Sarxz-
Vixcexr and Duets deny its occurrence in the Vibrio tritecs, Even Dre, writing as late as 1851, makes
the following statement on this subject ;—* Animalcula exsiccata, iterum humectata post annos reviviscere narrant
tel. Baver et Hexsrow, phenomenon rectius forsan motu moleculari explicandum” (Syst. Helminth. t, i. p. 132).
And even amongst those who admit the fact of the reality of the powers possessed by these animals of recovering
after periods of desiccation, most various statements have been made by recent writers ; thus Connorn states that
they are capable of recovering after © two or three years ” of desiccation, whilst Professor Airxzx (Sc. and Prac.

of Med. 1868, vol. iti. p. 126) even puts the period as low as from © four to seven days.”
