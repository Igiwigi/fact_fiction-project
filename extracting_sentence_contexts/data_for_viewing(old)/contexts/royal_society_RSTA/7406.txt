Ficure 2, Altitudes: conspectus of variability (log mean squares per point). Actual systematic
samples, v[h’], are represented by black circles, partial systematic samples, S,, by the full line, random
samples in blocks of d and 2d, Ry and R,, by broken lines, differences, D,, and sums taken alternately
positive and negative, £,, of points d apart by lines of alternate dots and dashes. The small black
circles on all these lines indicate the computed values.

The regularity of R, is due to the fact that the values, except for R,,, have been calculated
from the values of D,, and therefore approximately represent the values that would be
obtained with all possible block boundaries. In blocks of 16, for example, the mean squares
vary from 890 to 1310 according to the choice of block boundary, the mean being 1080,
compared with the value of 1110 from D,.

Various points are apparent from the figure. In the first place it will be seen that S,
conforms satisfactorily to the trend of values of »[h7]. The deviations are no greater than may
be expected from chance causes, having regard to the small number of values of h’; for small
d, and the lack of independence of the values amongst themselves.

All forms of sampling increase rapidly in accuracy as the sampling interval is decreased,
the precision per point being more than doubled, for example, for stratified random samples
