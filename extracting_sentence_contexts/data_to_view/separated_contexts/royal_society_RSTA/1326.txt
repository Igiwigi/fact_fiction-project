The microseisms became fairly
marked on the 20th and 21st owing to an advance of the monsoon in the neighbourhood
of Ceylon, well-marked on the 22nd, feeble again from the 23rd to 30th, strongly marked
on May 31 and June 1, very strongly marked from the 2nd to 10th, slightly weakened
from the 11th to 14th, but became very strongly marked again on the 15th and continued
so till the end of July, with only slight variations in intensity, in almost perfect response
to the strength and character of the monsoon. During this period the monsoon had
established itself in Malabar on May 27 and at Bombay on June 11, and a depression had
formed in the Arabian Sea west of the Laccadives on May 31 of whose movements
very meagre information could be obtained at the time from meteorological sources. The strongly marked microseisms from May 31 to June 10, which showed variations in
amplitude and were of the usual storm type, definitely suggest that the Laccadives
depression did develop into a storm and exist in the Arabian Sea till the 10th, a fact
which was subsequently confirmed by weather logs from ships. A break in the rains
occurred early in August and the microseisms rapidly weakened. Owing to the weak
character of the monsoon current that prevailed thereafter, they continued to be of
feeble intensity in August and September, except when depressions formed over the
head of the Bay of Bengal and affected the sea, and finally disappeared after the first
week of October.
