1. Except in a few very simple cases, the equations which govern the motion of a
viscous fluid have so far defied analysis. Their difficulty comes mainly from the fact
that they are not linear, so that the principle of superposition cannot be employed,
as in many branches of mathematical physics, to construct solutions by the method
of series or of singularities. For the same reason the flow pattern in the neighbourhood
of a moving body must alter when the speed of the body is changed, and it follows that
any exact determination of the pattern will be restricted to some definite speed. â€˜As a matter of fact, no precise determination of this kind exists, except in cases where
the motion is indefinitely slow.
