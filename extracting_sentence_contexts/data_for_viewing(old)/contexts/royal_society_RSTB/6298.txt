described, that shape can readily be explained by the exigencies of growth. The
power of budding may have been lost or may never have been acquired. If it
once was present there is no reason to believe that it was of the type characteristic
either of the perophorids or of the polystyelids, and the only likely method of
budding in Ciona would be the abdominal constriction typical of the diazonids,
distomids, and synoicids (cf: Berri, 1935, 6). This could have occurred only if
the gut-loop had descended into the stalk, and if the loop has always existed in the
same relative position as it occurs in living Ciona, then abdominal budding is
inconceivable. These two conclusions are therefore connected. If the position
of the cionid gut is primitive, the absence of budding is also a primitive feature.
If the position in the adult is secondary, then it is quite possible that abdominal
budding once occurred. The position of the gut, however, is the same in the
newly functional individual as it is in the adult, and the fact that this is the position
typical of very young diazonids before the gut-loop descends into the stalk in those
forms seems to confirm its primitive nature.

Thus no feature of the development or adult anatomy of Ciona can with certainty
be said to be specialized, while there is some evidence that every such feature is a
primitive character.

From this standpoint the remainder of the ascidians will be discussed.

From a cionid-like ancestor ascidians have apparently evolved in two main
directions, one involving the descent of the viscera into the stalk, the other the
shifting of the viscera forwards along the branchial wall. The first of these
