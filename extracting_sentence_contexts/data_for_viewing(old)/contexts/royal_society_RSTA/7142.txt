is the generalized free product of these G,,, with
H=G,oG, («+f)
amalgamated. (4-2)
Proof. We first show that different groups G,, G, intersect in just H. Clearly each G,
contains H, by the first assumption on the ¢,; hence
HCG, Gy.
Let now ge G,o G,; then
g=tz at, = tpia't, (a,a’e¢ A).
This gives tat, tg!a'ty = 1.
Now ¢,;! is in B but not in H, because of (ii). Ifa and a’ were not in H, the left-hand side
of our equation would have length >4 and could not be the unit element. Hence at least
one of a, a’ is in H, and then g is in H because of (i). (In fact then a, a’ are both in H.) I

follows that G,o G,CH,

and thus G,o G, = H.

Now let 8 be a set of left coset representatives of A modulo H. Thus every element ae A is
uniquely of the form a=sh (seS, heH).

We put 5, = St.

Then S, is a set of left coset representatives of G, modulo H (= t; 'Ht,). Every element g of
Q is generated by elements of the G, and hence is represented by at least one normal word
