59 had originally a ventral position, and the anus may be imagined to lie in it.
& Tn this figure the mesentery is oblique, but after the rotation of the mouth to the
"= posterior pole this oblique mesentery becomes transverse, and grows completely round
© the larva. There is nothing then that I can see to prevent the anus from continuing
g to migrate along the line of the mesentery, until it not only reached, but even passed,
3 the radius ©, in which the mouth formerly lay, so that, instead of stopping, as it does
fF in Asterids, in the interradius BC, it might reach the interradius CD, in which we
& find it in the pentacrinoid stage of Antedon : and this view is to some extent supported
not only by the exceptional case already mentioned, but also by the fact that the
rectum, before the appearance of the anus, is attached either in the radius C, or at any
rate nearer to it than the future anus is. If once the possibility be admitted of the shifting of the anus along the mesentery,
I do not see that any strong objections can be raised against the above hypothesis ;
but I confess that I should never have put this hypothesis forward if Thad not been
led to doubt the correctness of the old orientation by the fact that it necessitates a
belief in very great differences between Crinoids and other Echinoderms. Let us now for a while assume the correctness of the old orientation—let us suppose

that the larva swims backwards and fixes itself by its posterior end, and see what
these differences are. They may be summed up as follows :—
