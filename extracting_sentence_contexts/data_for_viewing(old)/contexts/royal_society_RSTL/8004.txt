Section R? R?* (Plate XVI. fig. 7). In screw steam-ships, as a rule, the greatest shearing-
force is experienced at the aftermost water-borne section, on account of the, to some
extent, unavoidable excess of weight at the stern. The * Bellerophon' and © Audacious'
are cases in point (se Plate XVII. figs. 9 & 10). The case of the © Minotaur” is excep-
tional in one respect, viz. that there is only a small difference between the shearing-forces
at the two water-borne sections; in most cases the absolute maximum would probably
be greater relatively to the other maximum shearing-forces.

Next, as to the sections where the shearing-forces have zero values. The extremities
of a ship obviously have no shearing-force to resist, and we have seen, in the case of the
* Bellerophon' (fig. 9), that at the sections of water-borne division the shearing-force is
also zero. The condition established in that ship holds for all the other ships I have
taken, and in fact for all ships when floating in still water. In the © Minotaur,” which
is the simplest possible case, there is (neglecting the extremities) only one 8uch 8ection
(a in fig. 8); in the other three ships, when fully laden, there are three such sections,


:

-where the curves of shearing-forces (V V, Plate XVI. fig. 7, Plate XVII. figs. 9 & 10)
cross the axis A B; and in the © Audacious,” when she has only her engines and boilers
on board, there are no less than five such sections (se Plate XVII. fig. 11). All these
cases, therefore, give an odd number of sections of water-borne division and of zero
shearing-forces ; and the number of these sections is one less than the number of water
borne sections where the curves of loads cross the axis and the shearing-forces are
