merely results of the expanding growth of the inner portions of the stem fissuring
outer bark, as is the case with exogenous stems. I may here express my conviction that many of the trees that have been 1
designated Sigillarian have no claim to be regarded as 8uch. Dr. Dawsox and other
palzeontologists have recorded the fact that the characteristic leaf-scars and other
superficial features of the younger stems and branches disappear towards the base of
the older trunks ; and this has evidently been the case with the Arran specimens. Our prolonged researches failed to supply the smallest portion of a true Sigillaria,
T obtained one fragment of a cast of the outer surface of a bark exhibiting what at the
firs glance had a Sigillarian appearance. It exhibits strongly-marked ridges, but,
these proved to be but casts of the unsymmetrical longitudinal fissures just referred
to.
