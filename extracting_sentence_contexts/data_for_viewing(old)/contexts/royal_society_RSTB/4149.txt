from the surrounding media by some mysterious function of the protoplasm, or
whether they are built together of fortuitous or selected materials, cemented together
by a substance secreted by the organism, renders the examination of the living animal
and the study of its life-history a task to which very definite limits are set. An
examination, in the vast majority of species, of the nuclear conditions and changes
can only be carried out upon individuals which are dead, and, at best, have been
preserved in some recognised fluid (such as Schaudinn’s), the precise nature of the
effect of which upon the dead protoplasmic body it is impossible accurately to calculate.
The geographical difficulty is almost equally great, for many of the largest, and many,
if we may use the word, of the “idiosyncratic” forms, are tropical species, having
intimate relationships with species inhabiting temperate or even Arctic zones, and it
becomes a physical impossibility to examine and compare these organisms alive, regard
being had to the fact that to arrive at any satisfactory conclusions the observer must
be on the spot to examine the animal when freshly gathered from the littoral zones, or
dredged from considerable depths. In the latter case, it is unnecessary to advert to
the difficulties inseparable from the work when carried out during the cruise of a
surveying ship, however perfectly its laboratories may be equipped, and the best
results that the biologist can attain are therefore to be derived from material preserved
fresh upon such cruises, or from slides mounted with the haste inseparable from such
work when carried out under such conditions.

It is consequently to a great extent only by the observation of carefully sought, or
