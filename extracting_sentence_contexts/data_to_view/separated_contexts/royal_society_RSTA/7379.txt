However, the head here is compared with the level of the liquid in the beaker which has very
low rates of shear throughout and is therefore also a sink. In other words fragments would concentrate both

in the manometer chamber and the free volume above the cylinder. The net result is a small pressure after
a long time, which in fact was observed in some experiments. BEHAVIOUR OF ELASTO-VISCOUS SYSTEMS UNDER STRESS 59

touches the rotating beaker at its centre and is symmetrically placed as shown. Again, a
negative result at all speeds should prove that the derivation was correct.
