It may be observed here, in anticipation,

that the tensile strength is much smaller in
the case of glass fractured by a direct strain in the form of bars, than when burst by
internal pressure in the form of thin globes. This difference is no doubt mainly due
to the fact that thin plates of this material generally possess a higher tenacity than
Stout bars, which, under the most favourable circumstances, may be but imperfectly

* annealed. There is also a considerable discrepancy between the strength of green and

crown-glass when in the form of bars and when in the form of globes. In the case of

the bars, the results are as 1-0 to 1:13 in favour of green glass, whilst in the case of the

globes, the results are as 10 to 1:2 in favour of the crown-glass. These discrepancies
