This model is based on
simple ingredients. It assumes that the grey and white matter can be considered as two hyper-
elastic layers in growth and that the origin of cortex gyrification comes from the differential
growth between these two layers. A growth anisotropy in the grey matter originates from the fact
that stem cell differentiation and differentiated cell proliferation occur simultaneously, in fetal life. The main assumption is only a differential and anisotropic volumetric growth of two gel layers
(grey and white matter) with the added hypothesis that white matter is slightly stiffer than grey
matter. These assumptions lead to a super-critical bifurcation in growth modelling.
