Wang et al. [122] succeeded in this
in the manuscript ‘UCsim2: 2D Structured Illumination Microscopy using UC2’, in which the
open-source three-dimensionally printed optics kit ‘UC2’ (You.See.Too.) is extended by super-
resolution functionality using SIM and image scanning microscopy (ISM). The open-source
documentation allows others to build a device themselves, e.g. for teaching purposes. A device
that costs only 5000€ instead of one million also contributes to the fact that several experiments
are carried out in many more places in the world (figure 1d). This allows laboratories in financially
less well-equipped institutes to keep up with cutting-edge science and contribute to scientific
progress. This approach also demonstrates the beauty of open-sourcing ideas.
