In the firs place, the protoplasm is apparently at once killed, although,
at the same time, decided shrinking occurs, owing to the great dehydrating power of
the reagent. This shrunken appearance is, however, somewhat magnified, because, in
addition to the contraction produced by the rapid abstraction of water, the protoplagm
has also been squeezed and pressed upon, on all sides, by the s8welling cell-wall. But
the point which must be especially strongly brought into prominence, is the fact that
during the 8welling any close relation which may exis between the protoplasgm and
the cell-wall appears to be maintained, at least where such relation is at all pronounced,
Thus in cases where reactions with Chlor. Zine Tod. and iodine show that the closing
membrane of a pitted cell is perforated by fine protoplasmic threads, it will be found
that when 8wch a cell is treated with sulphuric acid, the protoplasgm projecting into
the pit, and especially that portion of it abutting on to the closing membrane, will
firmly adhere to the latter, and will resist, without rupturing, a very considerable
strain ; and even if rupture should at length take place, ib will seldom, if ever, occur
close to the pit membrane. In attempting to explain the appearances produced by
the action of strong sulphuric acid, one must clearly bear in mind that there are
two factors to be considered, viz. :
