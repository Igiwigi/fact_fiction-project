30 stations send in results, and all assign character ‘‘ 2” to one particular day, while
half the stations assign “2,” and half assign “1” to a second day, the total character
sums obtained at de Bilt for the two days would be respectively 60 and 45, giving as
the mean estimates 2 and 1°5.

The principles followed in assigning character figures at different stations vary, and
the fact that the scale of values is so narrow necessitates grouping together at any
one station days which differ widely in disturbance. It is also very difficult to
maintain even a roughly uniform standard throughout a series of years. One naturally
wishes to discriminate between the days of each year, and if one adopts a standard
which gives fairly similar numbers of days of characters “0,” “1,” and “2” in a highly
disturbed year, one has in a quiet year hardly any “2's,” and a wholly extravagant
number of “0's.” The natural consequence is a tendency to lower the standard for a
“1” ora “2” in a quiet year, and to raise it in a disturbed year. This renders
character figures a somewhat uncertain basis for the comparison of one year or one
group of years with another, but it militates only slightly against their use when
comparing days of the same month, or even days of different months of the same year,
unless the year is much more disturbed in some months than others.
