only very slightly flattened in its middle part. Outline on the other side (that is, by the
outer lip) a little more flattened medially. Ornament obscure, consisting of fine spiral
ribbons, approximately twelve in ?mm., separated by incised spiral lines which are
rather narrower than the ribbons. Aperture very long and narrow, slightly wider
anteriorly, its posterior end very narrow but not surpassing the apex. Inner lip fairly
regularly convex, anteriorly (in the region where a columellar fold would have been)
decortication having produced a depression on the whorl infilling; there appears, however,
to be no true umbilicus. Outer lip thin, apparently subvertical and gently convex in
outline.

Dimensions. Holotype: height 1-5 mm.; width 0-75 mm.

Remarks. The fact that the outer lip does not apparently surpass the apex precludes
reference of the species to either Bulla or Cylichna; the outer lip, in addition, is not
prominent anteriorly as in Bulla. Cylichna volgensis Netschaew (B 1897, p. 193, Pl. 10, fig. 10),
from the Eocene of Russia, is considerably larger and has a more rounded apex. Bulla
nitens Sandberger as figured by Kissling (B 1896, p. 33, Pl. 3, fig. 1), from the Middle
Oligocene of Switzerland, has more shouldered whorls. B. redacta Deshayes (1862), p. 627,
Pl. 39, figs. 1-3), from the Calcaire Grossier of the Paris Basin, has a less blunt apex. The
form and outline appear to be characteristic.
