In the presence of helicity, with broken mirror-symmetry, the + degeneracy of the fully
isotropic case is lifted and the K*, H* fluxes can be distinguished. An inverse energy cascade, for
a subset of all the possible + interactions, is found; it is associated with backscatter and eddy noise
although this point needs further investigation. The other two sub-categories of interactions are


[+/ — +] and [+/ — —]. Different subsets of these interactions conserve different combinations of
K+*, H* [27], leading to different sub-dynamics. Kraichnan [43] had already noted the possibility
that the [+/+ +] and [—/ — —] modal subsets could lead to (partial) inverse energy cascades, but
he also remarked that the other remaining nonlinear interactions would swamp such effects.

Moreover, it is shown in [27] that these several fluxes are constant separately in the inertial
range. In fact, the presence of several invariants, beyond global energy and helicity, has also been
discussed by a number of authors. For example, the case of helical symmetry, as a generalization
of axial symmetry (the axis being now an helix) is discussed in [23]. Such flows are, again, quasi
two-dimensional; they have an infinite number of invariants, like for the two-dimensional Euler
equations, and are proven as well to be integrable [74].

A priori, the same type of argument can be used for magnetic helicity, and one expects as
well sub-invariants that are separately conserved. It is not clear whether this would explain the
behaviour observed in DNS of MHD for three different flows having the same global invariants
(Kr,Hc,Hm) and yet settling to different inertial range scaling [75]. This remains an open
question. Finally, we note that helicity cascades also occur in rotating turbulence [76]. However,
in the presence of stratification only, helicity is no more an invariant, and it decays substantially
more slowly than the energy [77], contrary to the non-stratified case. When both rotation and
