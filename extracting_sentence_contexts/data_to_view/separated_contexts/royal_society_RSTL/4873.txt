TI regard the spot as simply a protrusion outwards
of the edges of the canal while closing, after the vesicle has disappeared. I shall
presently show that a similar white spot is formed on the under surface of the egg of
the Frog s00n after deposition, and which might equally well be mistaken for the ger-
minal vesicle. Mode of disappearance of the Yesicle—The mode in which the vesicle disappears
may be inferred from the facts of its structure. Being filled with a progeny of cells
which we may regard as of different periods of growth, and these again containing
others, it is fair to conclude that this process of cell formation is that by which the
parent vesicle is ultimately destroyed. At the time when the germinal vesicle has
nearly attained its full size, the peripheral cells are smaller than those nearer to its

» centre, while the yelk cells that surround the vesicle are till smaller than either, and

are of a dark colour.
