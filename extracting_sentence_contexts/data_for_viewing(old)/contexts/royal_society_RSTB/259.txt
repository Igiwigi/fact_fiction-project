of slightly elongated cells. No trace of this was present on the fifth day, and even
on the seventh day it seldom extends much more than half way from the mesenteron
to the anterior pole. It usually has a more or less strong ventral curvature, in cor-
respondence with the curvature which, as already mentioned, most larvae show, until
they have been for some time free from the vitelline membrane. In longitudinal
sections it is generally possible to trace the right body-cavity forward into this axial
cord; and in favourable transverse sections it is even possible to make out that this
extension of the body-cavity is divided into five extremely minute cavities, arranged
round a central strand (fig. 19). This central strand or awial organ runs back to the
anterior end of the mesenteron, and it is around it that the right body-cavity assumes
the horseshoe-like form above described. Owing to their extremely small size, these
five tubular cavities, which clearly form the rudiment of the chambered organ, could
not be satisfactorily traced back individually into the body-cavity ; but, from the fact
that two of them appear in horizontal sections (fig. 21), and only one in longitudinal
vertical sections (fig. 17), and from certain changes which the right body-cavity

on the left, one of the latter forming in fig. 19 the median ventral chamber. Fig.
