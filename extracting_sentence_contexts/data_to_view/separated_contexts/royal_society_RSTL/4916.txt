If it be an artery there is no correlate vein. It
is traceable along one border only of the canal, coinciding with the Spiral convolations
of the latter as faras the anal outlet; no capillary system is traceable at its end ; no trace
of vessels of any description can be discovered in the parietes of the alimentary canal, According to my observations, again and again repeated, the interior of the blood-
vessel of the Sipunculidz generally is lined with vibratile epithelium ; of the truth of
this fact, extraordinary though it be, I am persuaded. The corpuscles of the fluid
contents of this vessel were found in every species to be the exact counterpart of those
of the fluid of the visceral cavity. They are identical in colour, in diameter, in figure,
and in structure, figs.
