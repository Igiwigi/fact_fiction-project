Such cases as these somewhat
increase the difficulty of finding a satisfactory theory of fossilisation, because it
is impossible to suppose that such delicate tissues could remain for a very lengthy
period undecayed prior to the entry of the fossilising fluid. It is also certain that
they could not have been tossed about much before they were preserved, nor could
any great weight of tissue have lain above them, for it is found that the bottom
layers are very much crushed by the weight of even a few feet of superincumbent
peat. Tt is necessary, therefore, while examining the structures in the mine, and while
considering the facts seen there, to remember the extremely delicate and destructible
nature of the tissues preserved in the calcareous coal balls. Position of “ Coal Balls” in the Sewam.—The “ Upper Foot” or “ Bullion” Mine, in
which the balls are found abundantly, is one of the smaller mines towards the base
of the Lower Coal Measure series, It is a small coal, generally about a foot thick,
with a shaly roof, in which the roof nodules with their many goniatites and other
marine shells are found. The “coal balls” lie actually in the coal itself, completely
surrounded by it, and scattered irregularly throughout its thickness.
