Even if this
procedure were held responsible for the whole difference between these two samples,
it must play a much smaller part in the difference between II and III. which
were both subjected to it for approximately equal times. Ideally, the total nitrogen
should have been determined in each case and the results expressed as a ratio of free
amino-nitrogen to total nitrogen, The fact, however, that III showed an excess over
II, nearly twice as great as that-of II over I, was sufficient indication that the
method as used by us would detect proteolysis if it occurred. Probably the difference
between IT and I is mainly due to commencing cleavage. li, Serum rendered Toxic by Incubation with Agar (BorvEt).
