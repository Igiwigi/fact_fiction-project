is always soluble. It follows from the inequality of the arithmetic and geometric means that

(3) is soluble if A = n!/n". By applying the same arguments to A, | x,|+...+-A,,| x, |, where

Aj, -..,4, are positive parameters whose product is 1, one can deduce that (3) then has in
fact infinitely many solutions. Further, by suitable choice of Aj, +++5A, it follows that there
are then infinitely many solutions of (3) for which any nâ€”1 of | x, |, ..., | x, | are arbitrarily
small (possibly zero).

But in most of the cases where one has reason to suppose that there are always an infinity
of solutions of an inequality such as (2), it is not easy to establish this by an extension of the
method used to prove the existence of a single solution. Especially is this true of the more
delicate types of argument which have been evolved to prove the solubility of certain
inequalities with the best possible values for the constants.

Much light has been thrown on the question by the recent work of Mahler (19464, 6) on
lattice points in n-dimensional star bodies. The following result, implicit in his work (see
Mahler 19464, theorem 23), is one of the most interesting from our present point of view.
