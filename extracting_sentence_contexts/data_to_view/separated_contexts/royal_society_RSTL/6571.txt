The localities afford therefore in this respect a contrast nearly as great as can exist in
any part of the globe; since magnetically the directions are the same, whilst geogra-
phically they want only 6* of being 180? apart, or diametrically opposite. The value
of this contrast appears when we proceed to consider the facts of the solar-diurnal vari-
ation at the two stations, and perceive rightly their important bearing on the correct
understanding of its true nature and character, and of the physical relations which
must be inyolyed in any well-grounded explanation. |

To prevent, as far as may be possible, misconception in the minds of those to whom
the 8ubject is not familiar, it may be premised that in speaking of the direction of the
magnet the eye of the observer is here supposed to be at its middle, and directed towards
the marked or north end; a change of direction towards the magnetic east will thus be

to the observer's right, and a change towards the west to the observer's left. Now the

most, marked features of the solar-diurnal variation, and which are found to prevail

univyersally in all the extratropical parts of the northern hemisphere, are, an extreme

deflection to the observer's right (or towards the magnetic east) about 8 A.Mt., and an

extreme deflection to the observer's left (or towards the magnetic west) about 2 P.M.
