To carry out the assumption here made,
M. Ws is obliged to suppose that the molecules of diamagnetic bodies are sur-
rounded by channels, in which the induced molecular currents, once excited, continue
to flow without resistance. This theory, notwithstanding its great beauty, is 80 extremely artificial, that I ima-
gine the general conviction of its truth cannot be very strong ; but there is one con-
clusion flowing from it which appears to me to be in direct opposition to experi-
mental facts. 'The conclusion is, © that the magnetism. of two iron particles in the line
of magnetization is increased by their reciprocal action; but that, on the contrary, the
diamagnetism of two bismuth particles lying in this direction is diminished by their
reciprocal action.” The reciprocal action of the particles varies inversely as the cube
of the distance between them : at a distance expressed by the number 1, for example,
the enfeeblement is eight times what it would be at the distance 2. The conclusion, as regards the iron, is undoubtedly correct; but I believe experi
ment proves that the mutual action of diamagnetic molecules, when caused to
approach each other, increases their repulsive action. I have had massive iron
moulds made and coated with copper by the voltaic current; into these fine bismuth
powder has been introduced and submitted to powerful hydraulic pressure.
