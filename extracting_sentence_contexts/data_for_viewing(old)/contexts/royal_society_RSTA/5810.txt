where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to f. Evidently gigdxidad (where here, and in what

follows, I shall drop the subscript g on the covariant and contravariant form of the metric tensor)

gives us the line element presented in equation (1.6) with a(t) =9'(t).

At this point some remarks concerning units is in order. We shall, for the most part, use
geometrized units in terms of which c=G=1, and all dimensioned quantities will have units
of length, ¢, to some power. To convey the fact that a physical quantity 2 has units of ¢* we write
2~t*. In terms of these units, the coordinates t, u, v, w~ ¢! and Sif ~ 0. Consequently 9’ ~09,
and hence for us y ~ £1. In terms of geometrized coordinates, the y; are unitless. This follows from
the fact that

9g 0
yildg) = 5 ~e-

Since gi ~ 09, we can use equation (1.4) to deduce that f ~ £°, as it does in equation (1.7). Later
when dealing with the more general FLRW metric given in equation (1.5) with k 40, I shall still
require gij dxidd ~ 02, f ~ £9 and g~ ¢!, but then some coordinates of T*M will have units and
others might be unitless. Lastly, a Lagrange scalar density, L, will be required to have units (~7,
since the integral of L over a four-volume must have units of action ~¢?.
