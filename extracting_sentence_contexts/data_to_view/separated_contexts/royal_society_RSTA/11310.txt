GEOFFREY DUFFIELD ON THE

To facilitate reference to the lines arbitrary letters have been assigned to them,
beginning alphabetically at the more refrangible end ; @ is not included in the portion
reproduced, but its behaviour resembles that of the strong line d. The prominent features are :â€”

(1) The broadening of the lines,

(2) Their displacement towards the red end of the spectrum,

(3) The changes in relative intensity,

(4) The obliteration of the series lines within the region examined,
(5) The absence of reversals. Unfortunately the exposures were not sufficiently equal for a strict comparison of
the reproduced photographs with one another to be feasible; but Plates 10 and 11
illustrate the remarkable fact that at the highest pressures the lines d, Plate 10, and
J, o, Plate 11, fail to impress the photographic plate, though they were originally
amongst the strongest lines in the copper spectrum. The plates also show that the most intense portion of each line is displaced under
pressure from the position it occupies at normal pressure, the direction being that of
increasing wave-lengths. Line j, at 70 and 80 atmospheres, affords a good illustration
of this point, and, since this line is, when under pressure, completely on the right-hand
side of the normal line, the phenomenon cannot be referred to an unsymmetrical
broadening. '

Unlike the spectrum of the iron are in this region, no reversals have been observed
under pressure.
