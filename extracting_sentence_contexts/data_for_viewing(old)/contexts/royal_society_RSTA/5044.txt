The paper of 1865 is lengthy and divided into seven parts. All of them contain insights and
innovations which illustrate how his thinking had developed since his papers of 1861-1862. In
this essay, I have translated Maxwell's notation into more familiar symbols for the sake of clarity
of the argument for the contemporary reader—these translations are shown in table 1. Note that
the set of equations is written in Maxwell’s mixture of electrostatic and electromagnetic units, that
is, in unrationalized units.>

(a) Part |—introductory

Maxwell begins with a lengthy introduction in which he reviews the entire field of
electromagnetism and sets out with great clarity the agenda he proposes to follow in the paper. In
fact, this introduction itself would find an appropriate place in any introductory undergraduate
course on electromagnetism. At the outset, he emphasizes the difference in approach of his theory
as compared with those of Weber and Neumann. Their approaches involved the use of ‘action at
