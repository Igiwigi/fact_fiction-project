(3) The breaking load of a thin plate of glass having in it a sufficiently long straight
crack normal to the applied stress, is inversely proportional to the square root of the
length of the crack. The maximum tensile stress in the corners of the crack is more
than ten times as great as the tensile strength of the material, as measured in an ordinary
test. (4) The foregoing observation is in agreement with the known fact that the observed
strength of materials is less than one-tenth of the strength deduced indirectly from
physical data, on the assumption that the materials are isotropic. The observed
