theory in quantum physics, as just another application of essentially the same mathematical
construction [16].

Other examples of non-physical applications of the contextuality theory can be found in
the work of Abramsky et al. [17,18] (see Abramsky and Caru’s paper in this collection). This
prominently includes contextuality analysis of record-sharing databases. Unlike in the study of
selective influences, the commonalities with quantum contextuality here were established from
the outset, but they too grew from the internal logic of the analysis of databases rather than from
any terminological similarities.

This should be sufficient to justify the ‘beyond’ in the title of this collection of papers. I also
need, however, to comment on the ‘and probability’ part of the title. On the one hand, this
serves to emphasize the fact that contextuality analysis in quantum physics and in many non-
physical applications is fundamentally probabilistic. For instance, in my favourite approach to
contextuality, called Contextuality-by-Default, theory of contextuality is essentially coextensive
with the theory of random variables. On the other hand, the title says ‘contextuality and
probability’ rather than ‘probabilistic contextuality’. The conjunction ‘and’ puts a conceptual
distance between the two notions. For one thing, this serves as an acknowledgment of the
possibility that contextuality analysis can apply to non-probabilistic scenarios too, as it is done
in the sheaf-theoretic approach to contextuality introduced by Abramsky & Brandenburger [17].
For another, it serves to acknowledge the prominent research in the foundations of quantum
physics and abstract quantum theory (understood as a probability theory detached from specific
physical applications), where contextuality plays the role of a guiding light. This line of research
is represented by recent work by Cabello et al. [19-21], including Cabello’s paper in this collection.
