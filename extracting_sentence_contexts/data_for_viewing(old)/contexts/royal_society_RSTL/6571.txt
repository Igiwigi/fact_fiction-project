the reflecting power of the silyered plate for the most refrangible of the solar rays, which
I readily found was due to a peculiarity of the metal silver. This metal is highly reflective
for the invisible as it is for the visible rays up to about the fixed line Sf, when its reflecting
power falls off, with remarkable rapidity, and for the more refrangible rays of the solar
spectrum is comparable with that of a vitreous substance rather than with that of a metal.
Steel, gold, tin, &c. showed nothing of the kind, but copiously reflected the invisible rays.

A few years ago, as Dr. Ropixs0N was showing me some experiments with the
induction coil, it seemed worth while to try whether the spark obtained when a Leyden
Jar has its coatings connected with the secondary terminals might not be sufficiently
strong to exhibit by projection the long _ spectrum shown by electric light. On
projecting a spectrum formed by a prism and lens of quartz on a piece of uranium glass,
the long spectrum was in fact exhibited. Tt was not, indeed, 80 bright as when formed
by means of a powerful voltaic battery, but nevertheless was quite bright enough to
work by. It was discontinuous, consisting of bright lines. On changing the metals

between which the spark passed, we found that the lines were changed, which showed
clearly that they were due to the particular metals.

Plate XLVII. In this Plate the group 8 should haye been represented as three lines, of which the middle
(specially named $) divides the interval between the 1st and 3rd in the proportion of 3 to 2 nearly, the spaces
between the lines being a little darkened by shading.
