By condition (H,) and property (P), one can see that equation (3.4) has no T-periodic
solution on 02; for any 0 <6 <1. Recalling that ImP and ImQ coincide with the set of real
constant functions, if 1 solves the equation QN(u) =0, then u is constant, say u(t) =c, that is,
So f(t,c,c,0) dt = 0. By assumption (H,), u cannot belong d2,. Therefore, we are in the position to
apply the Continuation theorem 2.5, obtaining

|DL(L — N, 2;)| =| deg(F, 2, 0 ImP, 0)|,
where

Thanks to condition (Hin), property (f;) and the definition of f, it follows that F(c) <0 if c <0,
F(0) =0, and F(r) > 0. Therefore, as a basic fact in degree theory, one has
deg(F, 2; 1 ImP, 0) = 1,

and this implies, by theorem 2.5, that problem (1.5) admits at least one T-periodic solution u in
,. Any T-periodic solution is non-negative and, if non-trivial, strictly positive in R.

However, the previous computation does not allow us to understand if (1.5) has only the trivial
solution or also some positive ones. Thus, in order to prove the existence of positive T-periodic
solutions and, in particular, to conclude the proof of the theorem, we employ the excision property


of the degree as follows. Consider the parametrized equation
—ul(t) =F (t, u(t), u(t — 2), u'() +av(t). (3.5)
