My attention
was then drawn to the work of SHELLSHEAR, who from comparative studies of the
distribution of the encephalic arteries in adult material had advanced certain hypo-
theses, summarized later in this communication, regarding the way in which blood
vessels were supposed to develop. The most direct way of testing SHELLSHEAR’S
hypotheses seemed to be that of studying intensively the development of the blood
vessels in a single form. The examination of the literature of the development of the vascular system
revealed the fact that hardly ever, if at all, had the development of arteries and
veins been studied at the same time. Moreover, through the development of
technique for the injection of embryonic material, it had been shown in many
forms that a preliminary stage of capillary plexus is antecedent to definitive blood
vessels. Yet although comparatively early embryos of birds and mammals had
been studied by this means, no work had been done on any form in following the
development of the blood vessels from the earliest stages to the adult condition.
