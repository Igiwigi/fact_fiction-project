any particular attachment to either membrane, but in the rest they were all connected
with the inner membrane, and when its inner surface was turned towards the eye, the

when he says (Obseryations sur la Structure de la M6duse Marsupiale), © Nor does the plaited membrane, which

kind of woollen fringe, which at first sight might be taken for a series of glandular sacs, but bythe aid of the
microzcope it is found that this appearance is due in fact to a multitude of suckers (ﬆupoirs), having the greatest
