this, however, where the pearl has been bored is destroyed,
and upon comparing the size of the central cell with that of
one of the ova, it is exactly large'enough to contain it.” The
ova themselves are formed upon pedicles, in the same manner
as the;yelks of the pullet's eggs; and must, when completely
formed, have a'similar mode of being discharged.

From these facts I have been led to conclude, that a pearl
is formed upon the external surface of an ovum.; which
having been blighted, does not pass with the others into the
oviduct, but remains attached to its pedicle in the ovarium,
and in the following season receives a coat of nacre- at the
same time that the internal surface of the hell receives its
annual supply. «+

This conclusion is verified by some pearls being spherical,
others having a pyramidal form, from the pedicle having re-
ceived a coat of nacre as well as the oyum.

The best mode of rendering the central cell conspicuous,
