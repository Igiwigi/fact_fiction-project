values of all feasible changes in C* to maximize V. Here V is the integral (from any point in
the state space) of the expected time-discounted future value of Z. So far Z has been used as an
indicator for each state point of the actual rate of income earned/paid over dt when the system
is at that state space point. The Bellman-optimized control policy C* at each state point simply
maximizes the probability-weighted (diffused) discounted value of Z along all trajectories from
that state point.

Therefore, we are able to compute the expected and discounted value, under C*(X, Y,Q,f),
of any event or variable at each state point. To do so it is sufficient: (i) to retain the optimized
C*(X, Y, Q, t); (ii) to replace the cash flow indicator function Z at each state point with an indicator


function for the event of interest (e.g. to record the qualitative fact of a physical over-delivery 8 |
at any state point, set an indicator function 1c. p; to record the size of a physical over-delivery

set C — D; to record its square, set (C — D)?, and so on); and (iii) to run the model to equilibrium 3
backwards in time using the new Z and unchanged C*. The resulting value in each X, Y, Q,t cell is : o
the expected discounted value under C* (over the time horizon being evaluated) of the outcome :<
indicator in question. From this discounted value and the interest rate r, the undiscounted time : Zs
average of the required qualitative or quantitative variable over all trajectories can be recovered. 13

(b) Effects on annuity returns AR = rV due to varying the energy storage device design

We return to comparing different ESD designs as in the subsection above, and we use the same
system balancing penalty as before, namely ¢ = 0.5, but we now examine the effects on V due to
