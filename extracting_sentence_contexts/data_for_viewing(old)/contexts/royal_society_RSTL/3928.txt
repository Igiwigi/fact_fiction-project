(r.) A diaphragm apparatus was charged throughout with s:{phocyanide of po-
tassium (K, S, Cy). Upon the first application of the current the action was brisk,
but s00n declined, and when 54 cubic inches of gas had been collected from the pla-
tinode and 14 cubic inch from the zincode it ceased. There was a copious orange-
coloured deposit in the zincode cell and upon the plate which interrupted the pro-
gress of the electrolysis; no particular odour was perceptible in either of the cells.
The liquid filtered from the zincode became turbid by exposure to the air, and de-
posited more of the yellow compound. The clear liquid was again subjected to the
current, which it transmitted readily, and with the same phenomena as before.
There could be little doubt that su{phocyanogen was the anion transferred in this
experiment. This part of our snbject still presents a tempting field for investigation,
from which however we were for a time diverted by an important class of facts which
next fell under our observation ; we have however since returned to the study, and
are at present engaged in researches upon the cobaltocyanides, and other double
cyanides, the results of which we hope ere long to lay before the Society.

6. We were purposing to follow up the examination of the double salts by the
electrolysis of other classes of these compounds, when we were stopped by the occur-
rence of a new order of phenomena, which it was necessary to turn aside and examine
as affecting the yery foundation of the process which we were employing. In our
examination of the phosphates, our plan had been to transfer by electrolysis the acid
of the alt placed in the platinode cell into a solution of potassa placed in the zin-
