bilayer is raised away from it. These kinetics were analysed
by counting the period of time that pores were open and
closed, as observed by oSCR, then fitting these lifetimes
with double exponentials [22] (see §2f). Although we
cannot conclusively attribute a mechanism to these two pro-
cesses, the shorter-lived closed period may be the result of
some non-conductive pre-pore state, a state that has a
higher probability of pore formation [18]. Short-lived open
states may be due to immediate relaxation of the local
field upon pore formation [22,31,32]. We found that the
characteristic lifetimes for pores in over-hydrated bilayers
were essentially identical to those for standard DIBs
(figure 2e,f). Further, the fact that these distributions were
again best fit with double exponentials suggests that the
short-time components observed here and_ previously
reported do not result from any bilayer interaction with
the substrate.
