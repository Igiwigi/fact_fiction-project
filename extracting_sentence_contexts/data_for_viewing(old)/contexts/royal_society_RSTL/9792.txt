the animal, like a Brittle-star, remaining permanently on its back. Tn this, as in
other species, the effect of dividing the nerve-ring on either side of a ray is that of
destroying its physiological connexion with the rest of the animal, the feet in that
ray, although still remaining feebly active, no longer taking part in any co-ordinated
movyement—that ray, therefore, being merely dragged along by the others.

Under this division it only remains further to be aid, that section of the nerve-ring
in the disc, or the nerve-trunks of the rays, although as we have seen 80 completely
destroying physiological continuity in the rows of ambulacral feet and muscular system
of the animal, does not destroy physiological continuity in the external nerve plexus ;
for however much the nerve-ring and nerve-tranks may be injured, stimulation of the
dorsal surface of the animal throws all the ambulacral feet and all the muscular system
of the rays into active movement. This fact proves that the ambulacral feet and the
muscles are all held in nervous connexion with one another by the external plexus,
without reference to the integrity of the main nerve-trunks.

2, Econint,—(A.) Section of external surface of 8hell,—If a cork-borer be applied to
the external snrface of the shell of an ZEchinus, and rotated there till the calcareous
substance of the hell is reached, and therefore a continuous circular section of the
overlying tissues effected, it is invariably found that the spines and pedicellarie within
the circular area are physiologically separated from the contiguous spines and pedicel-
lariz, as regards local reflex excitability. That is to ay, if any part of this circular
area be stimulated, all the spines and pedicellarie within that area immediately
respond to the stimulation in the ordinary way ; while none of the spines or pedicel-
lariz 8urrounding the area are affected. Similarly, if any part of the shell external to
