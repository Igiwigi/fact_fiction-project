I have repeatedly ascertained, and various gentlemen |
have witnessed, after the nerves/ are.divided, and the divided
ends separated, the due degree of voltaic electricity be trans-
mitted through the lungs, by those portions of the nerves
which remain attached to them, no-affection- of the. breathing
supervyenes, and 'the lungs, after death,! are found, quite
healthy, unless the electricity has been applied of-such/power,
or continued for such a length of time, as to excite inflam-
mation,, and | then. the appearances on dissection, are those of
inflammation, not those produced by the division' of the nerves of
the lungs,


300 Dr. Paitie's observations on the effects, &c. It appears from these facts, that the effect of dividing the
nerves of a vital organ, and separating the divided ends, is
not merely that of deranging its secreting power, but all
those powers on which its healthy structure depends ; and that
the effect of voltaic electricity, is that of preserving all these
powers. Tt is particularly to be observed, that the voltaic
apparatus should be s0 arranged that its influence may be
transmitted through the lungs as s0on as the nerves are di-
vided, the delay of even a short time appearing to give rise
to more or less morbid appearance in the lungs. The present Paper may be considered as the concluding
part of an inquiry in which I have been engaged for many
years; two papers relating to which the Royal Society did
me the honour to publish in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1817 and 1822.* To the first of these papers I have
already had occasion to refer ; the other was entitled, * On
the effects of Galvanism in restoring the due action of the
lungs.‚Äù The objects of this inquiry were to ascertain how
far the nervous power is essential to the function of secre-
tion, and the other assimilating processes of the animal
body ; and whether the voltaic electricity, applied as far as
possible, in the same way in which the nervous power is
applied, is capable of supplying its place in these processes.
