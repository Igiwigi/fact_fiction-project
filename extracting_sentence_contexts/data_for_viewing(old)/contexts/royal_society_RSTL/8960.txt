these open passages were rather spaces caused by the detachment of the vascular bundles
from the surrounding cellular tissne, snch as we frequently observe in sections of the
recent Lycopods. Further studies of these sections led me to conclude that the expla-
nation may be found in a combination of these hypotheses. Thus in fig. 8, e we have
an unmistakable gum-canal associated with the large bundle represented there. In
fig. 5, c similar combinations exist. In fig. 10, on the other hand, which is a longitudinal
section of one of the bundles belonging to the same specimen as fig. 8, we have no gum-
canal. Yet, as T have already shown, we cannot for a moment believe fig. 7, c to repre-
sent, in any sense, the small canals (ec, c) of the same figure. TI conclude, therefore, that
snch canals are wholly absent from some bundles as in fig. 9; that they are distinetly
present, but of small size, in such bundles as fig. 8, c; that they exist in similar position,
but of much larger dimensions, in such cases as figs. 1, 2-6, & 14; and that in examples
like fig. 7, such a canal, devoid of any true walls (being, in fact, a mere intercellular space),
has constituted a weak point, which has been converted into a larger irregular cavity
by the shrinkage of the neighbouring cellular tissues*.

'There yet remains to be considered the cortical layer of this curious plant. Here
again we meet with variations in different specimens. In very young rachides, like

* Kince writing the aboye T haye dried thin sections of the recent petioles of Angiopteris erecta between two
plates of glass, and found that lacunw were formed contiguous to each yascular bundle exactly corresponding
with those seen in my fossils. This obseryation puts the origin of these large lacun in mechanical shrinking
of the parenchyma 8urrounding the yascular bundles beyond the reach of doubt.â€”June 1st, 1876.
