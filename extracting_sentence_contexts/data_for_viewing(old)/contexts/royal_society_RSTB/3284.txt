154 MESSRS. E. A. N. ARBER AND H. H. THOMAS ON THE STRUCTURE OF

of structure exhibited by Lepidodendron or Lepidophloios. The structure of some
of the Subsigillariz, in which the primary xylem is, in whole or in part, aggregated
into separate strands or bundles, seems to suggest a more remote relationship with
Lepidodendron and Lepidophioios than is the case with the Eusigillariz.

The Eusigillarie are distinguished from Lepidodendron and Lepidophloios by the
fact that the stem is ribbed, and by the form and arrangement of the leaf-bases, as
well as the shape of the leaf-scar. Thus so far as the external morphology is
concerned the differences are great. When, however, we turn to the anatomical
structure, the comparison is closer. The phelloderm of Sigillaria scutellata
corresponds very closely to that of Lepidodendron selaginoides. The elements of the
primary and secondary wood are like those of any known Lepidodendron, which has
secondary thickening of the normal type. The presence of a corona, and the point of
origin of the leaf-traces are further resemblances to be matched among certain
Lepidodendrons, and are also found in a Lepidophloios. It is true that the teeth of
the corona in Stgillavia seutellata are much shorter, and less pointed, than those of
the primary wood of the Lepidophloios fuliginosus type of stem, but this is ‘a
difference of little value in such a comparison, and may vary with the species in
question. In the Rhytidolepis species S. elongata, the teeth are described by
