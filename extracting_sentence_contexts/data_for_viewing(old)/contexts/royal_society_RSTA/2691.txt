‘characteristic’ features, with characteristic energy, length and time scales. For example, the
magnitude distribution often largely deviates from the scale-invariant power-law (Gutenberg—
Richter law) behaviour. Such a deviation was also observed for the BK model under the simple
velocity-weakening friction law, but more so in the BK model under the RSF law.

Recent studies by Ueda et al. revealed that the BK model under the RSF law could describe
a slow nucleation process preceding the high-speed rupture of a main shock [41,42], which
is not describable by the BK model under the simple velocity-weakening law. Furthermore,
recent studies by Kawamura, Yamamoto and Ueda have revealed that the BK model under the
RSF law can also describe the slow-slip phenomena including afterslips and silent earthquakes
[43] (see also [44]). Afterslips are a long-lasting slow-slip process which takes place following
the high-speed rupture of main shock, while silent earthquakes are a slow-slip-only process
not accompanying any high-speed rupture nor emission of seismic waves. In fact, a recent
development in GPS technology and in high-density GPS and seismograph networks has revealed
these slow-slip phenomena where the fault sliding velocity is several orders of magnitude slower


than that of the standard high-speed rupture [45-53]. While such slow-slip phenomena have
turned out to be well reproducible by the BK model under the RSF law but are not describable by
the BK model under the simple velocity-weakening law. In this way, the 1D BK model under the
RSF law allows reproducing a variety of seismic slips within a single framework, including main
shocks, precursory nucleation processes, afterslips and silent earthquakes by varying only a few
model parameters.

So far, these studies on the BK model under the RSF law have been made for the 1D model.
