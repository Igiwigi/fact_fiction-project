For the boundary derivative the formula for
r = 2in table 1 is generally preferred, but r = 4 does not lead to very great complication and
can often be used with advantage. It may sometimes be convenient to arrange the mesh so that the boundary is no longer
a line of nodal points, but lies half-way between them, as in figure 3. “4 ° i 24

The difference equation (A. 6) is now applied at internal points only, and the fictitious
point —1 is as before calculated in terms of internal points by means of a formula for the
derivative at B. This is given by

h(dw/dx) = A, —gyA3 + fp At , —sHpA® + BAS, —..* (A. 12)
