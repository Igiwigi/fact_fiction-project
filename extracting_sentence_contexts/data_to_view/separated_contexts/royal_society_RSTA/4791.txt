In particular, their results show that
any class of tile assembly systems that has no mismatches, or disallows excess binding strength,
cannot simulate the abstract Tile Assembly Model.°

The result tells us that at least some of the tricky aspects of the intrinsic universality simulation
in [46] are required. In particular, in that simulation binding mismatches occur in numerous places
(often as a mechanism to decide which of the competing parts of anm x m simulator supertile will
‘win’ a competition to decide which simulated tile the supertile encodes). The fact that systems
without mismatches cannot simulate those with mismatches [49] tells us that this aspect of the
simulation is required. One of the key innovations in [49] is to generalize the window movie
lemma (a pumping lemma) from [45] so that it can be applied in significantly more complicated
settings. It will be interesting to see if this generalized ‘bisimulation lemma’ finds use elsewhere.
