The general distribution of the excess pressure is clear from table 3. The two-dimensional
value Ap, is steadily eaten into by the waves Ap,, 4p; radiating from O and O’. By the time
line AA’ is reached the excess pressure has fallen to zero all along the span. Thereafter the
excess pressure changes sign, and becomes steadily more negative with increasing z, until
the arrival of the waves from A and 4’ reverses the process once more. Physically, the
behaviour seems quite clear when the hydrodynamic analogue of the waves produced by
transverse movement ofa plank is considered. Excess pressure on the aerofoil is now replaced
by the height of the water surface along the plank. As the plank is initially jerked into motion
the level piles up on one side and sinks on the other, but waves running round the edges of the
plank gradually rectify the difference of level at the plank, until as we have seen at time
t = (2b/c) the level has sunk to zero all round the plank. Thereafter the level tends to sink
farther on the leading side of the plank and to pile up on the other, but again this tendency
is counteracted by the new waves running in from the edges. So, in fact, we have an oscil-
latory process—the oscillations in level becoming smaller, and the motion settling down to
a steady one, as the wave energy spreads out from the plank over the surface of the
water.

As pointed out earlier, the waves coming in at A, A’ ensure that there is no discontinuity
of pressure at the edge of the aerofoil (or of water level round the edge of the plank). The
detailed results given are broken off at z = 4ab. If we continued the solution we should find
the excess pressure falling to zero again, along the backward Mach lines from B and B’,
then once more rising to smaller positive values.

It may be well before discussing lift coefficients and the position of the centre of pressure
for a rectangular plate at incidence to recall the limitations of the linearized supersonic
