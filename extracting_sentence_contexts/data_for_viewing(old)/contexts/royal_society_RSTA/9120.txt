or the excess of Q.Q. over Q.D. occurrences. But day 80 is superior to day 81 as regards
the number of D.D. occurrences or the excess of Q.Q. over Q.D. occurrences. As regards
the latter item, its superiority to day 81 is enormous, and it is due in large measure to
the very large number of Q.D. occurrences on day 81.

To make the results from the group of days of highest disturbance comparable with
the others, multiplication by 3-36 (i.c., 1140/3389) is necessary. The outstanding
phenomenon is the large amplitude of the fourth secondary pulse. Another interesting
feature is the great excess in the number of D.Q. occurrences on day 81 over that on
day 108. The number of occasions when Q days follow 81 days after D days of the
highest class is quite outstanding.

Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between the results from day
— 27 and day + 27. A tendency in the most disturbed D days to be the second rather
than the first member of a sequence is consistent with the relatively large size of the first
subsequent secondary pulse mentioned in § 5.

§14. Table XV aims, like Table XIII, at comparing results from different groups
of years, but it is confined to sums of occurrences for 3 successive days centering at
27, 54, 81 and 108 days subsequent to the selected D and Q days. Also, as in Table XIV,
the primary D and Q days come from, the 19 years 1906 to 1924,
