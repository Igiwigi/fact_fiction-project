I cannot
detect in it any trace of that author's “gaine protectrice,” the equivalent of the
bundle-sheath of English and German authors,

We now come to the zone ¢, from which all cellular structure has so frequently
disappeared ; but here, especially in the part to the right of the figure, between c’ and
ec”, as well as at various other points within the area originally occupied by the inner
cortex, we have definite evidence as to the structure of that tissue. It clearly con-
sisted of an extremely delicate and, apparently, uniform parenchyma, which gradually
passed, as I have already suggested, into that composing the innermost portion of the
middle bark. With the exception of the latter fact, these conditions are in accordance
with the views of Broncnrart as shown at D, D, of his fig. 1, Plate 21. The structure of the middle cortex, d, varies somewhat from that represented in my
Plate 2, fig. 10, though there is less difference in the thickness of the cell-walls of the
inner and outer cells, and there is a strong disposition in many of the former to
arrange themselves in radial lines, whatever this may signify. Turning to the
prosenchymatous zone, e, we see that it has undergone a large increase of radial
thickness.
