formation of such compounds in the case of lotoflavin is not to be expected from the
formula we propose for it.

We have assumed in the formula assigned to lotusin that the maltose eyanhydrin
residue is attached to one of the hydroxyl residues of the pheno-pyrone ring. The
exact point of attachment cannot, however, be decided on the experimental evidence
at present available as to the properties of derivatives of this class of compounds.

The Enzymes of Lotus arabicus.

As has been already pointed out, the method of production of hydrocyanic acid
from this plant, by crushing it in contact with cold water, is characteristic of enzymic
hydrolysis, and this mode of origin is further supported by the fact that the formation
of the acid is prevented by boiling water and by alcohol, but not by antiseptics in cold
aqueous solution. As several enzymes are already known which have the power of
effecting the hydrolysis of glucosides, it was a matter of considerable interest to
ascertain whether the glucoside-destroying enzyme of Lotus arabicus was identical
with any of these. In making preparations of the enzymes of the plant the latter
was extracted with water saturated with chloroform in order to ensure antiseptic
conditigns. The usual methods of obtaining solid preparations were used, such as
precipitation of the aqueous extract by alcohol, precipitation of the enzymes upon
inert substances, such as calcium phosphate, and evaporation in vacuo of an aqueous
extract of the plant.
