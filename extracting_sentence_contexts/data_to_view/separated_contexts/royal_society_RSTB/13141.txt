Similarly, natural populations of the great pond snail the female reproductive tract [68], but this could here reflect
Lymnaea stagnalis differ in their expression of key seminal differences between mouse strains in not just plug size but
fluid genes, and corresponding functional variation could be also its protein composition [70]. There is clearly much we

Mating plugs formed from seminal fluid secretions are taxono- many other (non-plug) seminal fluid proteins are also known

(c) Spermatophores and nuptial gifts
Taxa in which ejaculates are delivered as an external spermato-
phore make interesting case studies for studying seminal fluid
investment patterns, because in these species seminal fluid
can potentially influence female physiology and behaviour
both via the ‘usual’ route when seminal fluid components are
taken up into the female reproductive tract together with
sperm, as well as by virtue of the fact that they may be ingested
by the female as a nuptial gift. (Note that others have argued
that all seminal fluid-mediated effects could fall under the
definition of ‘nuptial gifts’, in which case what I refer to here
would be just one—endogenous, oral—sub-category [73].)
One advantage of such study systems is that is possible to
directly recover and quantify the seminal fluid contribution to
the ejaculate [6]. Among bushcrickets for example, comparative
analyses do not appear to support a strong correlation between
testis mass and spermatophylax mass [46] but do suggest that
spermatophylax mass correlates positively with ampulla
mass [43,45], which may be because depositing a larger sperma-
tophylax enables more sperm to be transferred from the
ampulla to the female tract before the nuptial gift is consumed
(the ‘ejaculate protection’ hypothesis) [45]. Recent studies using
proteomics and associated methodologies have begun to dis-
sect the molecular underpinnings of the spermatophore in
bushcrickets [74], as well as in butterflies [75,76], moths [77]
and fireflies [78] with internally-deposited spermatophores.
