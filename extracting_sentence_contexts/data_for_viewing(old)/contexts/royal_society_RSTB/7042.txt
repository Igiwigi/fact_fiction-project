Each tissue is thus provided with an automatic braking mechanism which prevents cell
division becoming excessive and unregulated. Once developed, the depressor takes some
time to be eliminated, but as soon as this happens, if sufficient oestrogen is still present,
another wave of mitosis, reaching as high a peak as the first, follows. It is common, in
organs with a high mitosis rate, for there to be two waves of cell division within each
oestrous cycle, but the large intestine is unusual in showing three such waves, the first
reaching its maximum on the second day of dioestrus, the second in pro-oestrus, and the
third in metoestrus.

(v) General conclusion

It may be concluded that those substances which have come to be called oestrogenic or
female sex hormones are in fact general mitosis stimulators, that the degree of response of
a tissue to this general stimulation depends on its own inherent cell inertia, and that the
prevention of excessive mitosis is assured by the development of a mitosis depressor which
is also peculiar to the tissue involved.

(i) Introduction

A preliminary survey was made of the normal cycle of mitotic activity occurring in the
epidermis and dermis, as this region proved to be the most convenient for a study of the
