This happens sometimes several days after
the formation of the net-work has taken place. When clear
Serum without any globules is put upon the glass, nothing is
extricated, but when the serum is quite dry, it cracks, and the
cracks may be mistaken for the net-work ; but by comparing
them with it, the difference is found to be obvious. These facts which Mr. Bautr has enabled me to bring
forward, appear to point out an important change the blood
undergoes, after it is extravasated,. When this happens in
living animal bodies, from whatever cause, and in whatever
circumstances it takes place, no difficulty remains in account-
ing for its afterwards becoming vascular, since all that is
necessary for that purpose is the red blood being received
into the channels of which this net-work is formed. I shall not detain the Society with any farther observations
in support of what I have advanced, satisfied that if the facts
do not bear themselves out, it will be superfluous to load them
with theoretical opinions.
