Considering only the vibrations represented by the first mode, the curve (1) in figure 15
extends from 1’ = 37), to ¢’ = 2-64($7)), showing that a pulse propagated in this mode,
originally of infinitely short duration, is distorted as it passes down the bar into a disturbance
of duration 1-64(}7)). Since $7) = x/co, it is clear that the duration of the disturbance in-
creases progressively with distance from the origin. The finite duration of the disturbance
is clearly due to the fact that the (¢,/c),a/A) curve of figure 14 shows a minimum which
corresponds to a value of ¢,/¢y differing from zero. As regards the sequence of events at a given point in a bar, it follows from curve (1) of
figure 15 that when’ = $7, the dominant group at the point is composed of very long waves,
all of which have travelled with the same velocity ¢). As ¢’ increases, the values of J, and a/A
decrease, showing that the infinitely long waves are followed by shorter waves.
