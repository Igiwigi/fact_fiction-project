plates are piled above or in front of each other, and held in position by a delicate
framework. A structural homologue of the electric plate on a small scale already
exists in the motor plate of muscles. In the production of the electric organ of the

Skate advantage has been taken of this already existing structure, which has been in
fact enlarged to form the essential part of the organ, while the muscular fibre to which.
the motor plate belonged has been utilised in the formation of certain accessory
portions of the organ.

Previous to the researches of Banucnin the development of electric organs was
practically as obscure as their origin, and even now many biologists are unable to
understand the relation between muscular fibres and electric columns and dises,
Baxucuy, in addition to working out the development of the Torpedo organ, has on
several occasions referred to the organ of the Skate. The material at his command,

3 however, seems to have been limited, and it was impossible to identify the species of
