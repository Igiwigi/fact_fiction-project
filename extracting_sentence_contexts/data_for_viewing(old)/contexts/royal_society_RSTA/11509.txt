by the fact that the velocities at different points vary, as well as the directions of
the normals to the surface, we are driven to make some hypothesis.

Now the effect of the air-pressure upon a plane surface in uniform motion may be
obtained by integrating over it, provided that we regard the effect due to any small
portion as proportional to the area of that portion. }

We therefore assume, as a first approximation, that the contribution from any
clement of the distorted surface is the same as if the rest of the surface were in the
same plane as the element and had the same velocity ; that this assumption, in the
case of simple distortions, leads to results of the right character, is easily verified.

The determination of « depends on the fact that if the width of an arm measured
in the direction of the velocity of the point in question be c, and if f stand for the

* See THomson and Tarr, ‘Natural Philosophy,’ § 325. The existence of this couple is often stated
in the form that the resultant thrust on the plate does not act at the centre of figure. Lanavey finds
(chap. viii., pp. 89-93), that in the case of a square plate the point of application of the resultant
pressure, when « does not exceed ten degrees, is at a distance from the centre of figure equal to about
one-sixth of the length of the side. He quotes Joiissei and Kummer as having obtained a fifth and a
sixth respectively as the value of this ratio,
