Next, on calculating the curl of the conservation of linear momentum (3.28) and substituting
the streamfunction (3.29) yields

a2? 1 aw awh a2 (1)\ aw
ow 4 - - +4 =0 ing,
ay o|(% =) (2)| (3 ay? oTy (z) axdy o in

aw = aw =0 on 022, 6:30)
ax oy
v=Vo on dQ,

where the symbol A? stands for the biharmonic operator. The boundary conditions arise naturally
by virtue of the definition of y and also from the fact that the boundary itself is also a streamline.
Note that this is a linear PDE for y with the function G given from the previous step of the
axial flow. In particular, if the exponent n = 0, the function G becomes constant and the equation
reduces to a biharmonic equation and the solution for y is constant, which we can pick to be zero.
Without any loss of generality with regard to the boundary conditions, we can rewrite the
problem as follows:

a | 1 (ay aty a1 ry ay ia 1 aw 0 ing
ax* |G \ ax? ay? ay2 | G \ ax2 ay? J |"  dxdy | G axay | ,

ov = x =0 on 022,
w=0 ond.
