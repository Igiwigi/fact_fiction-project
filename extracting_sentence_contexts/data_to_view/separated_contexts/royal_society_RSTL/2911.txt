In the Carabus the neryous 8ystem is also large, as are likewise the organs of respi-
ration, but the amount of heat and activity of respiration are low, and the same is the
case in the Blaps, in which the nervous system is rather small. If the development
of heat depends upon the nervous system, or the number of ganglia, the Leech, which
has twenty-two ganglia, ought to generate more heat than the laryz of lepidopterous
insects, which have but ten or twelve, and the larya ought to generate as much as the
perfect insect. In the larye of the Bee, the Hornet, Ichneumon, and Tenthredo,
which generate 80 large an amount of heat, the neryous system is exceedingly small ;
and if, as some $uppose, heat is the result of muscular contraction, surely it ought
to be most developed where there is the greatest amount of muscular contractility ;
it ought to be generated more in the Leech than in other articulated animals, and
in those Vertebrata which are peculiarly noted as cold-blooded. 'These facts con-

* This is in perfect accordance with the condition of the circulation in the human body during sleep, and
at the moment of waking, as noticed by BuumexBacu, and as I myself once had an opportunity of observing in
a female patient who was suffering from severe fracture of the skull, for which she had been trephined ; subse-
quently to which, a large portion of the bone (the right parietal) became affected with necrozis and was removed
by operation, and the patient afterwards gradually recovered, At least one-third of the whole parietal bone had
been removed, and a large surface of the dura mater being thus exposed, the activity of the circulation in the
brain was readily observed. I thought this a fair opportunity, as the patient was recovering, for observing the
state of the circulation during sleep, and at the moment of waking. The patient was sleeping soundly at the
time of the observation, and while she remained entirely undisturbed, the pulzations in the arteries of the dura
mater were at the rate of ninety-four beats per minute, and were perfectly synchronous with the pulzsations at
the wrists; but immediately she began to inspire deeply at the moment of waking, the pulzations became much
accelerated.
