More facts are urgently needed which may or may not be
supplied when we are thoroughly acquainted with the anatomy of all the living
species of the Schizea. Boonie follows Zenerrr (op. cit.) in deriving the type of
central cylinder found in Anemia and Mohria from that found in Schizea, and this
in turn by dilatation from the solid concentric stele of Lyyodium. In the absence of
facts bearing on the transition from one type of central cylinder to another in this
group, it seems to be impossible to more than speculate. However, on the evidence
afforded by the Osmundacez it seems probable that the type of central cylinder
found in Schizwa is derived by reduction from that which is characteristic of Mohria
and Anemia. BoopiE introduces certain general theoretical considerations which
may be more conveniently discussed at a later stage.
