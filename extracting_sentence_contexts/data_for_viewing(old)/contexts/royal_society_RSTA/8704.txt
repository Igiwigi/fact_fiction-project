75° F. at5 am. The relative humidity (as shown by a hygrograph belonging to the
Brazilian Commission) followed the temperature closely, varying from 30 per cent. in
the afternoon to 90 per cent. in the early morning.

May is normally the last month of the rainy season at Sobral, but this year the rainfall
was very scanty ; there were a few afternoon showers, each ushered in by a violent gust
of wind ; and on May 25 there was very heavy rain, which was welcome for its moistening
effect on the ground, the dust hitherto having been troublesome to the clockwork
although every care had been taken to protect it. There was a fair amount of cloud
in the mornings, but the afternoons and nights were clear in the majority of cases.
Mt. Meruoca, 2,700 feet high, about 6 miles to the N.W., was a collector of cloud, its
summit being frequently veiled in mist. In spite of its cooler climate, the summit
would thus not have been a suitable eclipse station, and, in fact, nothing of the total
phase of the eclipse was seen from it.

12. Although water was generally scarce, we were very fortunately situated as we
enjoyed an unlimited supply of good water laid on at the house. This was of great
benefit in the photographic operations. Ice was unobtainable, but by the use of earthen-
ware water-coolers it was possible to reduce the temperature to about 75°, and by working

only at night or before dawn development of the plates was fairly easy. Formalin
was used in every case to harden the films, and thereby minimise the chance of distortion
