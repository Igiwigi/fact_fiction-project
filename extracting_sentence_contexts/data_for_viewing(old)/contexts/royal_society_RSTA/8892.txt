effects, due to this retentivity, which have perhaps existed for centuries, can be
removed in a few minutes, and it is then found that the specimen (for example the
Dolerite, E. 6519*) may have increased â€˜susceptibility.

Experiments have been made which prove that the method is applicable to powders,
thus making it possible to deal with magnetic permeability of fair average samples
obtained, if necessary, from relatively large areas. The powders are placed in a glass
tube of known internal volume, and by taking into account the specific gravity and
total weight of the powder in the tube, the measure of concentration is obtained, and
results comparable with those of the same material in the solid state can be readily
secured.

Emphasis should be laid upon the fact that samples cut from the same hand-speci-
men frequently show widely different susceptibilities, as illustrated by the Mount
Sorrel granite (L. 15). The only satisfactory way in which to obtain an average
result is to test a large number of specimens of the same rock.

It may be observed that when a rock is spoken of as having a high susceptibility,
as for example in the dolerites, the susceptibility-value is in reality exceedingly small
as compared with the susceptibility of such a material as iron in which the suscepti-
bility may have a maximum value of 40,000,000 x 10-* in C.G.S. units.

My best thanks are due to E. F. Herroun, Esq., F.LC., for the use of his magneto-
meter and for his valuable assistance.
