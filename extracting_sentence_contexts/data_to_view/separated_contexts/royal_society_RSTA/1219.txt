In the
first place the character of the experimental evidence suggests the functional form for
the expression for the energy of the solid, and also for the rate of dissipation of energy
(if any—there is none according to the classical theory of elasticity). In the second
place, quantitative experimental results indicate the approximations that must be
made in reducing these unknown functions to tractable form. Thus the fact that an
elastic solid strained within the limit of perfect (statical) elasticity always returns to
the same equilibrium position when released from a strained position can be shown to
justify the expression of the “* strain-energy ” in terms of the geometrical strain. The
quantitative relation expressed by Hooxn’s law (even in its simplest form) suggests
that, in the expression for the strain-energy, powers of the strain components of order
higher than the second can be neglected. In §1, a theory of the thermodynamics of a continuous medium is worked out in
