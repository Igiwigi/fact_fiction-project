503. It is very evident that when the width of the decomposing conductor
yaries, as is always the case when mere wires or plates, as poles, are dipped into
or are surrounded by solution, no constant expression can be given as to the
action upon a single particle placed in the course of the current, nor any con-
clusion of use relative to the supposed attractive or repulsive force of the poles
be drawn. The force will vary as the distance from the pole varies; as the
particle is directly between the poles, or more or less on one side; and even as
it is nearer to or further from the sides of the containing vessels, or as the
s8hape of the vessel itself yaries; and, in fact, by making variations in the form
of the arrangement, the force upon any single particle may be made to in-
crease, or diminish, or remain constant, whilst the distance between the par-
ticle and the pole shall remain the same; or the force may be made to increase,
or diminish, or remain constant, either as the distance increases or as it dimi-
nishes. 504. From numerous experiments, I am led to believe the following general
expression to be correct ; but I purpose examining it much further, and would
therefore wish not to be considered at present as pledged to its accuracy.
