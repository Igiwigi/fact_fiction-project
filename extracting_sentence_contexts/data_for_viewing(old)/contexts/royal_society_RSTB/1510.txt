In the present instance the same method is used to demonstrate certain short
tract degenerations in the thalamencephalon and mesencephalon as well as the
medullated fibres which leave the degenerate pyramidal system both in these regions
and in the bulb.

In a paper ‘ Ueber die Fasersysteme am Boden des Hirnventrikels,’* DArKscHE-
witscH and PrisytKow drew attention to the anatomy of the fibres in front of the
third ventricle, viz., Forrt’s, MryNnert’s, and GuDDEN’s commissures ; in a second
paper, ‘ Ueber den Faserverlauf in der hintern Commissur,’+ DarkscHewitscu tried
to demonstrate the connexions of the fibres of the posterior commissure.

In the present communication, by using the newer method of demonstrating tract
degeneration, some fresh facts have been adduced, which it is hoped will contribute
to the knowledge of these tracts.

Foret’s Decussation.

This name was given by DARKSCHEWrITSCH to a system of decussating fibres first
described by Foret,{ which lie immediately in front of the third ventricle and behind
Meynert’s and Guppen’s commissures. It must not be confounded with Foret’s
“fountain” decussation lower down at the level of the oculomotor nerves, although
