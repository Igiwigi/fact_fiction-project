the hind-limbs horizontally, the other sagittally, i.e., at right angles to the plane of
the digits.

Stage F (Plate 3, figs. 8 and 9).

This stage is of great interest as being the first in which the generic characters are
fairly assumed ; the long beak, with its slightly curved tip, and sub-terminal nostrils


AND DEVELOPMENT OF APTERYX. 33

(Na.), mark the embryo at once as referable to no other genus than Apterya. From
the fact that, as shown by sections, ossification is just about to commence in the
larger bones of the limbs and the membrane bones of the skull, the stage may be
taken to correspond with a Chick of the eighth or ninth day, The entire length from
tip of beak to end of tail is now about 60 mm. The head has attained its maximum
relative size.

The form of the head, apart from the beak, and the form and curvature of the
trunk, are much the same as in the previous stage, but the tail is relatively smaller,
and so are the eyes.

The fore-limb is now an undoubted wing; the second digit (fig. 9, 2) has grown out
of all proportion to the first (1) and third (3), which form mere blunt projections on
the pre- and post-axial borders respectively.
