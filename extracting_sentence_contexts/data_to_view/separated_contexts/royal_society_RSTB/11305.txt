Modern studies compete over the largest numbers of cultures
studied or participants involved, with some reaching millions [2,3]. But these
studies, focused on amassing data, cannot advance our understanding of the
underlying psychobiological systems and the processes of individuals’ normative
and pathological functioning and development. In fact, such mass investigations
of a broad range of differential dimensions are possible only by capitalizing on the
efficiency of language-based tools such as standardized questionnaires that
capture people’s beliefs and therefore enable investigators to collect their data
online and thus remote from their participants [4-7]. These approaches, although still popular in psychology, have clearly met their
limits. Claims that the psychometrically derived Five Factor Model (FFM) reflects
a universal structure of individual differences [3] could not be substantiated;
no reliable and specific neurophysiological correlates were found, and multiple
neurophysiological systems of individual differences reported in the neuro-
sciences were not incorporated [8].
