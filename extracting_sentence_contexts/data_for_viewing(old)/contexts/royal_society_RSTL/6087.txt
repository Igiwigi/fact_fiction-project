a Galeruca 1 found them very large. :

I have examined only few species of Coleoptera, since STEIN has devoted 50 much
attention to them, that, as far as the female generative organs are concerned, there 1s n0
order with which we are better acquainted.

In the Homoptera I have examined Aphrophora spumaria, Coccus hesperidum, and
C. persice; Professor HuxLEey (7. c.) has described a species of Aphis, and Profess0r

LEVCKART three or four allied forms. All these present the same type of ovary as the
Hemiptera; but the terminal germ-chamber is generally smaller, and the cells contained
in it much less numerous, being in fact, in C. hesperidum, only three in number. In-
deed in this genus, as there is only one egg in each tube, there is in fact a group of
vitelligenous cells to each egg-chamber ; and this form of ovary forms an intermediate
link between the types found in the Hemiptera and the Hymenoptera.

The latter part of this paper will contain a full account of the formation of the egg
in C. hesperidum, to which therefore IT need not here allude in greater detail.

In Forficula auricularia the egg-tubes are short and very numerous; each contains a
large egg more or less mature, and two or three small rudimentary ones. The large
egg is pear-shaped, and the other two germs, together with the membrane containing
