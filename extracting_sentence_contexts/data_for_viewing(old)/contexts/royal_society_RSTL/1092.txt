the Decomposition of the Farths, &c. 335

I delayed for some time laying an account of many of the
principal results which I obtained before the Society, in the
hopes of being able to render them more distinct and satisfac-
tory; but finding that for this end a more powerful battery,
and more perfect apparatus than I have a prospect of seeing
very 800n constructed, will be required, I have ventured to
bring forwards the investigation in its present imperfect state ;
and I shall prefer the imputation of having published unfinished
labours, to that of having concealed any new facts from the
scientific world, which may tend to assist the progress of che-
mical knowledge.

2. Methods employed for decomposing the alkaline Earths.

Barytes, strontites, and lime, slightly moistened, were elec-
trified by iron wires under naphtha, by the same methods, and
with the same powers as those employed for the decompo-
sition * of the fixed alkalies. In these cases, gas was copiously
evolved, which was inflammable; and the earths where in con-
tact with the negative metallic wires became dark coloured,
and exhibited small points having a metallic lustre, which,
