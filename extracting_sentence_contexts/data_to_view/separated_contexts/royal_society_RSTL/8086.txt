such that it meets the tangent plane in the sibiconjugate lines of the involution formed
by the intersections of the tangent plane 'by the -chief cone and the circular cone
respectively; that is, in a pair of lines harmonically related to the intersections with the
chief cone, and also to the intersections with the circular cone; the conditions are

((A), - - Xa, -.)=0,

(A)+(B)+(C)=0,
viz. if only these two conditions are satisfied the cone will intersect the tangent plane
in the two principal tangents.
