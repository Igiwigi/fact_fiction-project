lacral plates of each double series, 80 that the two clefts together form a large diamond-
shaped opening through the test. This opening is filled up by a strong chitinous mem-
brane, and a large pore penetrates the centre of the membrane, affording an exit to the
duct of the ovary. The primary radioles are large and long, cylindrical or pointed round

longitudinally striated, and strongly toothed round the edge; in fact assuming a very
peculiar and characteristic form. The pedicellariz are numerous and two-valved, a
structure as yet unique, s0 far as T am aware, among Echinoideans. The auricles are
fused together through the greater part of their height in the middle of the interambu-
lacral are, sending off short wing-like processes which arch over towards the ambulacra,
but scarcely extend beyond their edges. The peristomial opening, the buccal membrane,
and the dental pyramid and teeth have much the same character as in Cidarts.

I feel very little hesitation in referring the following very remarkable form to the
enus Porocidaris of Des0R, even although it is wanting in the very character upon which

that genus was founded, and although the characters upon which its claims to generic
Yistinctness are based are not shown in any of the fragments which alone have been met
