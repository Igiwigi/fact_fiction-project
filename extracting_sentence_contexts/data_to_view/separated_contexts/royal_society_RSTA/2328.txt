The term P;(F|@) accounts for
the variability of the compressive strength, and the same lognormal PDF employed for case C2
and C3 was selected for comparative purposes. Comparing the C4 fragility curve with others, it is possible to observe that the median collapse
value is not maintained. This is due to the fact that the prior joint-PDF of the elastic parameters
has a different median value compared with the posterior joint-PDF (figure 7). Moreover, the
dispersion of the collapse fragility curves increases from C1 to C4. This variability is a result of
the role played by the different sources of uncertainties on the seismic vulnerability of masonry
towers, as well as the different approaches employed to define it.
