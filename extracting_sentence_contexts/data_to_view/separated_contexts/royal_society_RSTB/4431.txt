As, for essential purposes, the
colourless form differs from the parental form only in the absence of sclerotial
pigmentation, the presence of the former could not possibly be ascertained in a
culture of the latter in the absence of the formation of its sclerotia. If, therefore,
the aberrant form arose as a single spore variation, it is impossible to locate exactly
its point of origin. Certain facts relevant to the foregoing must, however, be noted. It has been an
invariable technique throughout the whole of the research, when transferring
inoculum from one tube to another, to take this either from a single conidiophore or,
preferably, from a single germinated sclerotium. Now, every conidiophore and each
sclerotium arises not only from a single original spore, but actually takes origin in a
single mycelial cell.
