there were various other remains such as wood, bark, bud-scales, as well as several leaves
ofa different form, which, although a specific identification was not possible, were apparently
all Salix.

Wood of some 1 cm. diameter was collected towards the base of the mud at site 42B (at
290 cm.) ; sections showed the heterogeneous ray-cells characteristic of the genus Salix. In
the upper part of the gravelly-soil deposit of site 42B and again in the upper layers of the
lower peat (Carex-wood peat, site 42B) were smaller pieces of wood, also probably Salix,
but differing somewhat from that at the base of the muds.

Associated with the latter material (i.e. Carex-wood peat of site 42 B) and also of the lower
part of the gravelly-soil were many bud-scales, which from their small size (c. 0-7 x 0:6 mm.
and others ¢. 2:0 x 1-2mm.), rounded shape, and the fact that they were formed from
a single scale evidently also belong to some species of Salix. Similar bud-scales were also
found in large numbers in the Carex-wood layers of the lower peat in site 36 (2 to 14 cm.).

These were associated with numerous twigs which had bark varying in colour from light
grey to dark brown. In some cases the bud-scales were still attached to the twigs. All
apparently were Salix, though which species it was not possible to say.
