The resemblance was such in my first trials, as to induce
me to endeavour to procure a further supply of columbium,
and by application to the Trustees of the Britich Museum, I
was allowed to detach a few grains from the original spe-
cimen analysed by Mr. HATCHETT.

Notwithstanding the quantity employed in my analyses was
thus limited, I have, nevertheless, by proportionate economy
of the materials, been enabled to render my experiments suf-
ficiently numerous, and have found so many points of agree-
ment in the modes by which each of these bodies can or
cannot be dissolved or precipitated, as to prove very satisfac-
torily that these American and Swedish specimens in fact
contain the same metal ; and since the re-agents I have em-
ployed are in the hands of every chemist, the properties
which I shall enumerate are such as will be most useful in
the practical examination of any other minerals in which this
metal may be found to occur.

In appearance the columbite is s0 like tantalite, that it is
extremely difficult to discern a difference that can be relied
upon. The external surface, as well as the colour and Justre
of the fracture, are precisely the same ; but columbite breaks
rather-more easily by a blow, and the fracture of it is less
uniform, appearing in some parts irregularly shattered ; ne-
