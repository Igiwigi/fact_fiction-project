are smaller, more numerous, and more uniformly distributed ; while the internal are
larger and fewer, several of them occurring in close proximity in one place, none at
all in another. The transverse strive described in the Flounder are well marked in
the Brill both in the internal and external bodies. In a piece of the skin mounted
flat in Canada balsam unstained the two layers of iridocytes can be separately seen
by focussing at the corresponding levels. The distribution of the outer is related to
that of the scales, they are more numerous over the central regions of the exposed
portions of the scales, scarce along their borders. On the other hand, the deeper
iridocytes which belong to the argenteum are arranged in rows, they are elongated
in shape, and touch one another by their extremities ; the rows again form a loose
net work with irregular meshes.

It is evident from the facts thus elucidated, that there is no difference in kind
between the two structures which have been distinguished as _iridocytes and
argenteum. The argenteum in its primitive condition in the Flounder is a collection
of iridocytes. But no case is yet known in which the superficial iridocytes develop
into a continuous layer of argenteum. We cannot say at present why the reflecting

substance is abundantly deposited in the skin near both surfaces, and not at all at
intermediate levels, nor why the deeper layer often increases till it becomes
coutinuous and of considerable thickness, while the more superficial layer remains
