is insoluble in ammoniacal cupric oxide, and moreover it gives with Chlor. Zinc Tod. not
the customary blue but an intense red-brown coloration. Lastly, the result with
HorMayn's blue appears to point to a protoplasmic character, opposed to which con-
clusion is the fact that it dissolves in 8ulphuric acid. Thus the question appears to
be, whether it is related to protoplasm or to cellulose, or whether it consists of
a modified cellulose basis permeated by a protoplasmic strueture.* This, however,
minute study of development alone can decide, but the point I wish to bring forward
is the fact that it is coloured by dyes which especially stain the protoplasm.

There is a curious parallelism in the action of callus towards HoEMANN's blue and
of pit, membrane towards methylene blue, after treatment with the same reagent
(viz. : sulphuric acid) which may perhaps be worth mention.

If asection of a second year stem of e.q., Vitts vinifera, be treated with HoOFMANN's
blue it will be found that both the protoplaxgm and the callus will be stained. Tf,
however, sulphuric acid be allowed to act before staining, the callus will naturally
be dissolved and will no longer colour, and only the protoplasm will be left stained.

Tf in the same way a 8ection of pitted tissne, e.9., pulvinus of Robinia, be treated
with methylene blue, both the cell wall and the pit membrane become coloured, But
