selected Q days had amongst the 180 days which followed them at intervals of 26, 27
or 28 days, 48 more Q days than D days, and 48 heads the fifth column. The sum of
these two excesses, 63, heads the 9th column. These figures, 15, 48 and 63, will
naturally be larger according as the corresponding positive, negative and difference
pulses, respectively, are the better developed. We see that precisely, as in Table XVIII,
1922 is pre-eminent in all its difference pulses. It owes its premier position to the fact
that its positive and negative pulses are both well developed.
