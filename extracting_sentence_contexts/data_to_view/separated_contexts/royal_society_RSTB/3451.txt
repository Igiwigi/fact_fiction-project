OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS. 77

(e) The Archenteron and its Walls in the Postgastrular Stage.—We have already
shown in this and in our earlier communication (03) that in the preceding
“gastrular” stage the archenteric cavity is not a tubular canal, but is relatively
wide and dorso-ventrally flattened. In these respects it agrees with the corre-
sponding stage of the reptilian archenteron as represented in the descriptions and
figures of various authozs, e.g., MeHnert, WiLL, Mirsukurt, etc. But even in the “ postgastrular” stage now under consideration it is easy
to obtain the clearest evidence of the fact that the typical and original form of
the archenteric canal is that of a transversely elongated and dorso-ventrally
compressed cavity. It is true that it no longer possesses this character throughout. We have just seen that the blastoporic aperture bears traces of its primitive widely
extended form.
