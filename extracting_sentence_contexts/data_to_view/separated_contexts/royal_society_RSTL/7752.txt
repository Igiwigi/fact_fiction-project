In order that we may retain the three first terms only in the expansion

it is necessary to show that f(a) and the snecceeding differential coefficients are not infinite. Now they
generally will be infinite in the case where y=f(#) is an infinitesimal Error, as f(z) will be of the form

we may take 0 as small as we please, and yet retains only the three first terms above, becanse the differential
coefficients of y do not here become infinite; in fact it is easy to s8ee that any differential coefficient
Ty will consist of a series of terms of the form
