This
peculiar departure from a regular progression will be distinctly traced in the projected
results (Plates XIX.â€”XXII.). It is there seen, in all the four series, that after a steady
decrease of the temperature in the lower portion of the curve, this decrease becomes
arrested, and, for a space of about 2000 feet, the temperature remains almost con-
stant, or even increases by a small amount; the decrease being afterwards resumed
and continued, without much variation, throughout the upper portion of the curve. In the series of August 17 and 26 this fact is strikingly coincident with a large and
abrupt diminution in the amount of aqueous vapour; the same coincidence being

exhibited, in a less marked manner, on November 10. On October 21, the departure
from a uniform decrease is very decidedly shown in connection with the stratum of
dense cloud passed through.
