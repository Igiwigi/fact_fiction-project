Partial septa are also found in Kaulfussia and Marattia, though less commonly. These are genera with slightly elongated sori, and if they have been derived from a
type with a circular form of sorus, such as that of Asterotheca, the partial septations
might be regarded as related to the elongation of the sorus, just as in Danwa, though
in a less prominent degree. The facts and arguments contained in the above pages are not put forward as
leading to any definite demonstration as to the mode of origin of the Marattiaceous
sorus, or us to the relations by descent of any of its various types. The contention
which I do press, however, with some persistence, is that these questions are still
open, notwithstanding that writers of authority have treated them as already
decided, whether by evidence from fossils, or from development of living forms. I
have above pointed out how in my opinion the paleophytological evidence is insufli-
cient to prove the priority in the Marattiaceze either of the type with separate
sporangia, or of the synangial type.
