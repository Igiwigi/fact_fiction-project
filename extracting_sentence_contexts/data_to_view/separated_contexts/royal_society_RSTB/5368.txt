This condition is clearly seen in the top right-hand leaf-
trace in Plate 50, fig. 10, which should be compared with a bipolar leaf-trace of Thamnop-
teris schlechtendalii figured by Kipsron and Gwynnu-Vaucuan.* But very soon the
protoxylems come to occupy a position which is symmetrical with regard to both the
tangential and the radial planes (Plate 3, figs. 22, 23). As the bundle steadily expands and assumes an elliptic form, each of the protoxylems
develops into a peripheral loop (fig. 21), and for a time the strand closely recalls a stage
hurried through by the leaf-trace of Asterochlena lara. But for the fact that the peri-
pheral loops are permanently closed, the resemblance of this temporary phase with the
definitive form of the petiolar strand of Dinewron would be extremely close. Presently the
elliptic outline gives place to a distinctly fusiform shape (figs. 19, 24, 25), exactly like
that of a diarch root-bundle of the same plant, although, of course, the immersed pro-
toxylems leave no chance of confusion. This is about the level at which the relatively
slender petiole becomes free from the stem.
