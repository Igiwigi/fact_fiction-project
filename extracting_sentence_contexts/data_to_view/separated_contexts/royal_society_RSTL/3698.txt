forms may have existed on its surface, My previous investigations have now demon-
strated the truth of this conclusion as applicable to the earth from the first formation
of its external solid shell. All such hypotheses, therefore, as have sometimes been
made with respect to a change in the poxition of the earth's axis are entirely excluded,
whether we suppose the interior of the earth to be now, or to have been heretofore,
Solid or fluid. A fact also, in itself not uninteresting, is thus established in the ear-
hest history of our globe. Nor would it have been possible, I conceive, to arrive at this result by any general
considerations immediately derivable from the nature of our problem, and independent
of its complete solution. The investigations contained in my two preceding memoirs
were, in fact, commenced under the impression that the solution of this problem of
the precession and nutation of the earth's axis on the hypothesis of the interior fluidity
of the earth, would probably lead to results different from those which had been long
before obtained on the supposition of the earth's entire solidity.
