distinct and unconnected branches of the phenomena. The terms of M. Araco imply
the same thing. He says, © when in our climates the aurora borealis is complete,
when one part of its light pictures on space a well-defined arch, the culminating point
of this arch is in the magnetic meridian ; and its two points of apparent intersection
with the horizon are at equal angular distances from the same meridian. When it
projects luminous columns, [by which he evidently means streamers,] from different
portions of the arch, their point of intersection, called by certain meteorologists the
centre of the cupola, is found in the magnetic meridian, and precisely upon the pro-
longation of the dipping needle.” Here too the arches and the streamers are con-
sidered as distinct objects. But an arch of the aurora is composed of a number of
Streamers grouped and aggregated together within a defined stereometric space, whose
bounding planes bear certain relations to the lines of magnetism of the earth. It is
this fact that I announced in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal in 1823, and after-
wards in the letter to the President of the Royal Society ; and if the arrangement is
not yet understood, it may have been owing to a misapprebension of the terminology
I employed; or, more probably, to my not having, in the letter to the President,
entered into a detail of the varieties of the arches that often present themselves, as I
had done in the Edinburgh Journal. I would endeavour now to supply the deficiency,
by defining the terms, and entering into s0ome more detail of the varieties, or rather
apparent varieties of the arches; for the numerous observations of the aurora I haye
since made, convince me more fully of the existence of that definite order of its
arrangement and progress which I have formerly described, and that it is worthy of
being understood, however much I may have hitherto failed clearly to explain it.

The terms arch and streamer of the aurora, I had used without defining them,
