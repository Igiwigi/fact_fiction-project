at the centre c or at the extremity a; as 2180 from the fact already noticed (36.), that
whatever part of a charged conductor be connected with the fixed disc of the balance,
or with any other species of electrometer, the instrument is equally affected. The
proof plane, therefore, if it really exhibits the ratios of the quantities of electri-
city disposed in different points of a charged body, must depend materially on the
resistance to an equal participation in the charge, arising from its little inductive
susceptibility ; it is hence very desirable to investigate experimentally the various
effects which increased thickness, or extension of any kind, position, intensity of
charge, and the like, may have on its indications. An experimental inquiry of this kind
is, however, extremely difficult : we are, for example, open to all the sources of fallacy
above described (15.), and illustrated by Table TV.
