Therefore only by certain combinations of events
would the first peak in a new area seem likely to coincide with a peak in an old one. It is
therefore not specially remarkable that, with the exception of area E, peak densities in
the new areas did not coincide with those in the older enclosures in the Marchnant valley. The problem, which was not answered by any facts discovered during this inquiry, is
why peak densities should have been reached simultaneously in 1937 in all the old planta-
tions, and in most of the younger ones in 1938 despite their different years of enclosure. This question is discussed theoretically in a later section.

The main features of the seasonal changes in population structure of Microtus are known
from Baker & Ranson (1933) and Brambell & Hall (1939).
