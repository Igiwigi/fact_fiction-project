The very oblique internal fibres, on the other hand, are connected with the oblique internal,
these in their turn being connected with the slightly oblique internal, and the lightly
oblique internal with the longitudinal or vertical internal. In some instances the longi-
tudinal external are connected directly with the longitudinal internal, and 0 of the slightly
oblique, oblique, and very oblique external and internal fibres. 'The bladder, urethra, and
prostate are bilaterally symmetrical, and the fibres composing them pursue something like
seven directions, the fibres crossing with remarkable precision at wider and wider vertical
angles as the centre of either is reached, as in the stomach and heart *, In fact the
fibres of the bladder, stomach, and heart have a strictly analogous arrangement, and I am
inclined to believe that functionally also they possess points of resemblance. Very similar
remarks may be made regarding the structure and functions of the uterus. From a careful examination of a large number of mammalian bladders, I am of opi-
nion that fundamentally the fibres are arranged in two principal directions, viz.
