The next supposition that naturally occurs is that, though the quantity of oxygen
carried by the blood is not deficient, the partial pressure of this oxygen is abnormally
low. The rate at which oxygen is given off by the red corpuscles passing through
the capillaries of the body depends, not on the quantity but on the partial pressure of
the oxygen in each corpuscle; and if this pressure is diminished shortage in the
oxygen supply must occur. Let us see how far this consideration will help to explain
the facts. We may assume, as was done above, that the haemoglobin of average venous
blood during rest is 64 per cent. saturated with oxygen; also that, as indicated
by the experiments described in Section VIIL., the circulation rate was unaltered on
Pikeâ€™s Peak, so that the quantity of oxygen extracted from the blood in each round
of the circulation was the same.
