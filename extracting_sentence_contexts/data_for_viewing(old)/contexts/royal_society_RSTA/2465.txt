[61] making it comparable to O-OFDM [30]. Nevertheless, the digital implementation of the 1g
pulse shaping filters of each subband is simplified as the filters cover a smaller frequency range :
enabling the use of lower oversampling factors w which are closer to the Nyquist sampling
frequency [78], while the optimization of the filter length can provide important performance
improvements in aggregate data rate and bandwidth efficiency [58]. It should also be noted that
multi-band CAP produces a modulating signal which has a larger PAPR than that of the single-
carrier CAP and therefore is more susceptible to nonlinear transmission impairments [89]. This
is due to the fact that the modulation of multiple sub-carriers by independent symbol streams
results in a higher probability of particular harmonics to interfere constructively and generate
larger signal amplitudes. A larger number of subbands increases this probability, thus leading
to larger PAPR ratios [61]. Finally, it has been shown that the increase in spectral efficiency
tends to saturate with the use of larger number of subbands [29,31,86], which indicates that their
number needs to be optimized for a particular link. Increasing the number of subcarriers beyond
a certain number offers no additional performance improvements yet requires additional system
components.

(b) Improved equalization

Significant research has been dedicated to the equalization of CAP-based systems as it is a
fundamental requirement in enabling high data rates in VLC links. Different equalizer types
