Rities of the alkaline salts for precipitation.
S Ferrideyanide of Tron.—The blue precipitate from the ferrideyanide of potassium and
2 protosalt of iron is soluble in oxalic acid and the binoxalate of potash, but not in the
-eutral oxalates. This blue liquid is quite incapable of passing through the dialyser,
Znd is equally colloidal with ordinary prussian blue. So also is basie prussian blue
prepared by the spontaneous oxidation of precipitated ferrocyanide of protoxide of iron.
E[his last colloid might probably be purified with advantage upon the dialyser.
EZ The ammonio-tartrate of iron, ammonio-citrate of iron, and similar pharmaceutical
Spreparations are chiefly colloidal matters.
S Suerate of Copper —The deep blue liquid obtained by adding potash to a mixed 80lu-
ER of chloride of copper and sugar appears to contain a colloidal substance. Placed
n a dialyser for four days, the blue liquid became green, and no longer contained either
otassium or chlorine; it in fact consisted of oxide of copper united with twice its
weight of s&ugar. The external liquid remained colourless, and gave no indication of
copper when tested with sulphuretted hydrogen. The colloidal solution of sucrate of
copper was sensitive in the extreme to pectizing agents. Salts and acids generally gave
a bluish-green precipitate; even acetic acid had that effect. The precipitate, or pectous
sucrate, after being well-washed, consisted of oxide of copper with about half its weight
of sngar, and is therefore a subsncrate. When the green liquid is heated strongly, it
gives a bluish-green precipitate, and does not allow the copper to be readily reduced to
the state of 8uboxide. The subsucrate of copper possesses considerable vivacity of colour,
and might be used as a pigment. A solution of sucrate of copper absorbs carbonic acid

from the air with great avidity.
