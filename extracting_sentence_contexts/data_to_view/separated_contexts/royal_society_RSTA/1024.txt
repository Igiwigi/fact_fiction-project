The starting point of the Mooney-Rivlin model can be found in the original paper by
Mooney [6]:

When a sample of soft rubber is stretched by an imposed tension, neither the force-
elongation nor the stress-elongation relationship agrees with Hooke’s law. But, if the sample
is sheared by a shearing stress, or traction, Hooke’s law is obeyed over a very wide range in
deformation. ... Another simplifying feature in the elasticity of rubber lies in the fact that
deformations are normally produced without any appreciable change in volume. Rivlin was able to substantiate this point of view by clarifying several theoretical and
experimental aspects of rubber mechanics. He produced the mathematical model (3.1), which
‘led to the exploration of the nonlinear theory of elasticity in deep and unexpected ways, yielded
significative classes of non-homogeneous exact solutions and provided a new perspective to the
interpretation of experimental data’ [7].
