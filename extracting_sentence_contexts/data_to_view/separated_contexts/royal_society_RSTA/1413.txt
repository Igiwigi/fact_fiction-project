Another feature of the photograph is the banded character of the flame after
“detonation” had been set up; for although it became very faintly visible in the
burning medium towards the latter part of the “ pre-detonation period,” the bands did
not become pronounced until after detonation, and were then bounded by the
“ detonation’ and “retonation’’ wave-fronts, in which region the frequency of
their occurrence was about 45,000 per second. It may here be remarked in passing how clearly this and the next photograph show an
initiation of ‘* detonation ” taking place well ahead of (rather than behind) the advancing
flame-front. It has sometimes been suggested that in such photographs an apparent
setting up of a “ detonation” in advance of the flame might be due to “ halation ”
effects ; but in our opinion any such supposition must be definitely ruled out in this case
because, (i) if true, it would involve a displacement of an image on our film of between
3 and 4 millimetres, which, in view of the fact that the total thickness of the film was
only 0-25 mm., seems impossible; (ii) the angle of the incident light falling upon the
film at the particular instant in our experiments when the detonation was set up hardly
diverts from 90°, the image of it being formed practically at the centre of the film,
(iii) we have found that, in different experiments with precisely the same film and optical
arrangements, the distance ahead of the advancing flame at which the “ detonation ”
is initiated varies between 3 and 5 mm. in an image formed in the centre of the film,
corresponding to varying distances of between 3 and 5 cm. in the object irself, and also
finally, (iv) the degree of halation actually obtained in our photographs, which may be
judged from the thinning down of the dark reference marks in the luminous parts
thereof, is many times less than would have to be assumed on the supposition in question.
