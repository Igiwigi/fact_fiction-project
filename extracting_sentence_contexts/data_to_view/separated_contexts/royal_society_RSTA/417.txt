At the time of Newton and indeed up until the nineteenth century, the concept of a
fundamental constant did not exist. Newton did not express his law of gravitation in a way that
explicitly included a constant G, its presence was implied as if it had a value equal to 1. It was
not until 1873 that Cornu and Bailey explicitly introduced a symbol for the coupling constant in
Newtonâ€™s law of gravity, in fact they called it f. It did not take its current designation G until
sometime in the 1890s. The development of the concept of fundamental constants was intimately linked to the
development of systems of physical units.
