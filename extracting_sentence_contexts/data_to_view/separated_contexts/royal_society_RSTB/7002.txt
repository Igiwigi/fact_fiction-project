Above the upper limit of the bottom-dwelling diatom flora characterized by Melosira
arenaria var. hungarica, the diatom flora is very uniform, and no further zones could be
distinguished until the Asterionella ooze was reached. Pollen analysis has provided a method
by which certain horizons in the upper gyttja deposits can now be recognized.

(b) Stratigraphical results. The contribution of pollen analysis to the elucidation of the
late-glacial stratigraphy has been to confirm the view that the period of interruption in
the regular varve deposition which in shallow water led to the formation of detritus silt
was in fact a temporarily warmer climatic period. Since the laminated clays contain
practically no pollen or organic remains, any possible explanation of the marked irregu-
larities sometimes found in the deep-water laminated clays must await further geological
investigation, notably of the varve sequences. These irregularities may be due to channels
in the late-glacial deposits, grounding of icebergs, the presence of persistent blocks of dead
ice, or to slumping of the deposited clays similar to that described in Palaeozoic submarine
clays (Heim, 1908).
