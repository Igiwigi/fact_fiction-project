man become extremely pale and fall down almost senseless for a few minutes, from
having received only a very small puncture while he was in the act of passing a
Trygon, weighing 3 kerm., from one person to another. Besides this, he relates the

three Thalassochelys caretta. One of the Trygons died, and on examining it he
found that the sting was broken and entirely gone. - After a few days one of the
Thalassochelys would not eat any more, unlike the others who ate with great
appetite, and remained in a corner of the tank. It lived thus for four days and died
on the fifth. On examining it, he found the sting of the Trygon buried quite 6 cm.
