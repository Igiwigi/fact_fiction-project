dinner, even if the water is secreted alkaline, it becomes mixed in the bladder during
Sleep with acid water which is afterwards secreted and thus the alkalescence escapes
notice. 1t seems highly probable that the quantity of acid poured out into the stomach
sets free alkali sufficient in some cases to make the urine alkaline; and from facts
which have been stated to me, it seems eyen possible that the same effect on the
water may Sometimes be produced by the separation of acid by the skin.
