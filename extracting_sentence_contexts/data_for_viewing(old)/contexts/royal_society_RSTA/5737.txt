where A and B are unknown, non-universal (ie. dependent on all details of the system)
prefactors.The predictions for the structure functions within the viscous/dissipative range of
scales follow from (3.4) and (3.6) by simple power counting without any intermittency correction.

In the above discussion, we assumed that the coupling between velocity and temperature
is negligible everywhere in the inertial range of scales, except at the largest scales where
buoyancy fixes the balance between inertia and buoyancy (i.e. it forces the velocity fluctuations).
Our assumption led to a Kolmogorov scenario which is consistent with the hypothesis that
temperature is passive within the inertial range of scales. If one assumes that velocity and
temperature are scale-by-scale balanced within the inertial range of scales, a new scaling
behaviour would emerge (scaling a la Bolgiano), which is however not observed in our
simulations. In conclusion, the fact that temperature behaves passively in the inertial range of
scales is a work hypothesis which is successively verified via a consistency check.

4. Direct numerical simulations

In order to verify the above phenomenological theory, we rely on fully resolved direct numerical
simulations. The equations of motion (2.1)-(2.3) are solved numerically within a cubic domain box
of size L = 84R, R being the radius of the circular opening from which air is injected according
to the time-varying profile representative of human cough proposed by Gupta et al. [3], with a
peak Reynolds number of Re = tmax2R/v © 20 000. The flow is assumed to be periodic at the four
sides and we prescribe a convective outlet boundary condition at the outflow boundary. We use
