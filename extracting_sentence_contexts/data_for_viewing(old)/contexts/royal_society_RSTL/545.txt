trary ; then the general solution of the problem is

þ (2,9) =#(/2,f9)
Ez. 1. Given the equation (z,y) = þ (— £8 =]
here we have f(z)=f(—-x), and a particular solution is fa==2*;
also f (y) =f(=) and a particular case isf (9) ==
1 x1 1
hence the general solution of the equation is
(2,9) =0(x,=)
@ being perfectly arbitrary.
If we employ the. general solutions of the equations
ea =f=z) andf(y)=f(=), we shall still only have one
arbitrary function. In fact, the most general solution of the
equation v (z,y) =v (—z, =) with which I am at present
acquainted is
and this only involves one arbitrary function.

PrRoBLEM II.

Given the same equation
v (2,9) =v (az, by)
Suppose one particular solution of this equation is known,
