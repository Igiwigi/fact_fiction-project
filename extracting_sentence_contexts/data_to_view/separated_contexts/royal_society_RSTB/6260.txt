The significant feature of all the isthmal glands is the reduction in the degree of
secretory activity as compared with the albumen region. Viscous rather than
semi-fluid secretions are revealed by fixation and staining. It is difficult to explain
these histological findings in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of
the albumen is secreted after the egg leaves the albumen region and that this albumen
is of a thin fluid type. Further, the rate of albumen production has been expressed
by Peart and Curtis (1912) in a parabolic curve, with no discontinuity in the rate
from the time the egg leaves the albumen region to its completion in the uterus. At
least 10Â° of the egg-white is added while the egg remains in the isthmus.
