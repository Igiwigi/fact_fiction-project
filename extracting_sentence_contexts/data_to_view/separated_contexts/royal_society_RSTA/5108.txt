However, we shall
proceed on the basis that the hierarchy problem is pointing us in an interesting direction if we
take it seriously as a problem, expecting that gravitational degrees of freedom will induce a huge
quantum correction to the Higgs boson mass. If we examine the correction to the Higgs boson mass shown in figure 1, we note an interesting
fact: the large corrections have an different sign for the first contribution compared to the second. In fact, this is a property of quantum field theory: fermions give a negative sign, whereas bosons
give a positive sign. Supersymmetry provides a mathematical reason for a large cancellation
between the two diagrams, by imposing a symmetry on the quantum field theory between bosons
and fermions. For every fermion degree of freedom, supersymmetry imposes that there must be
a corresponding bosonic one, with identical mass and couplings.
