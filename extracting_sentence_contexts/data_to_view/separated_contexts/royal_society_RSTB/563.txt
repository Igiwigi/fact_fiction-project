The Pelycosauria. There are few data for judging of the systematic value of the Pelycosauria. But
in view of the fact that the Anomodontia was originally made to include animals
which are allied to the Pelycosauria, supposing that group to be well founded, it seems
more in accordance with usage to class those animals among the Anomodonts than to
adopt a new name like Theromorpha for a well-known ordinal type. There is need, however, that the distinctness of the Pelycosauria should be esta-
blished. The tibiale and centrale are said to unite to form an astragalus which has no
movement on the tibia.
