such as farmers, suppliers and distributers, are usually reluctant to enable free data exchange of
temperature recordings for a particular shipping lane, out of fear that they could be used against
them in filing claims or other types of disputes.

However, it is important to note that quality supervision with better insight may or may
not result in dynamic logistics for the cold chain, such as assigning transportation based on the
product's predicted shelf life, but it is important either way because it helps to identify the weak
links in the chain and can result in structural changes, albeit static, which improve the quality
and efficiency significantly. For example, pallets inside a container of strawberries shipped across
the continental USA will have up to 5°C temperature differential depending on where they
are placed inside the container, causing a notable difference in their quality and shelf life [49].
Hence, a temperature-controlled container’s set point is an extremely poor approximation of the
actual product temperature. In fact, inconsistency in the quality of fresh produce from the same
field can only be explained by temperature variations that it might have encountered during
transportation, which can only be measured by a better quality monitoring system using higher
resolution than the container level.

Even though the majority of the articles discuss loss reduction, a key advantage of FEFO-
enabled cold chains is the provision of consistent quality to all the stakeholders, which also
improves the forecasting accuracy and the profits. Different companies might have different
priorities, such as offering high-quality /high-cost or low-quality /low-cost perishables depending
on their customer base. The logistics parameters of FEFO can be adjusted to accommodate both
types of priorities, which is only made possible by accurate prediction of the shelf life of the
inventory to be distributed. High-quality perishables can be made available to the customers at a
premium cost by choosing the products with relatively long shelf lives to be delivered in shorter
