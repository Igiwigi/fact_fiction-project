The approximate equality of the make/break and break/make periods was used as
the criterion for the correct symmetrical setting of the contact carried on the rod M.
The setting of the fine adjustment screw was varied until the successive half-periods
were very closely equal, as shown by the chronograph record. When this was achieved,
the two platinum wires forming the contact were just touching when the pendulum
was vertically at rest. A small correction had usually to be applied to the chronograph
reading owing to the fact that it was impossible precisely to equalize the two half-
periods by means of the adjusting screw. This matter will be dealt with more fully in
ยง 6, where a typical set of chronograph observations is discussed. THE ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY 73

(f) Knife-edges

The knife-edges used throughout these experiments were made of hardened steel.
