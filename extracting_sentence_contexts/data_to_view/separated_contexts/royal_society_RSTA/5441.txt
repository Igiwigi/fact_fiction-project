Based on these observations, to
mitigate unnecessary cost, to improve the final product quality (thus higher value) and to
reduce the uncertainty and insufficiency caused by the human participants, an internal structural
change that reshapes the interconnectivity is needed. To achieve this, it is not just about setting
up the information-sharing protocols and constructing the data transmission networks, but
rather, about associating the physical assets, the contextual information, the domain knowledge,
and the human operators and the managers throughout the entire product life cycle [9,10]. In fact, numerous practical factors (concerns) such as confidentiality, trustworthiness and an
explosion in the scale of transmissible data can make the solution space very limited. What
we need is a constantly learning ‘living’ model—a digital counterpart of the above-mentioned
components—the digital twin. In one aspect, only the legitimated parties can communicate
and interact with it via the digital thread [11,12].
