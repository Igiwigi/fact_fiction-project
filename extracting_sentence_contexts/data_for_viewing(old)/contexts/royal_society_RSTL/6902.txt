According to the theory of FRESNEL,
J __cos (i+r)

Icos (i—r)

an expression which vanishes at the polarizing angle (i+r=90"), and therefore
tan=(7) ought at this angle of incidence to vanish also; but we find, not only in this

experiment, but in those which follow, that it does not vanish, but only reaches a mini-
mum, the tangent of which is sensibly equal to what I have called the Coefficient of
Reflexion®.

In fact, let > denote the angle whose cotangent is this coefficient. Then I cosa, J 8m a
are the principal components of the reflected light, which by definition is circularly
polarized, and therefore I cos a=9 sin a, and

J
cot A=T

The coefficients of Refraction and Reflexion, as determined by this experiment, are

therefore
Coefficient, of Refraction=tan 54* 57'=1:4255.

Coefficient of Reflexion =cot 84* 31'=0:0960.
