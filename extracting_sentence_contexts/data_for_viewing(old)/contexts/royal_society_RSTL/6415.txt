poles, &c., are provided with various screw adjustments as to position, range, &c., and a
8lender spring beneath the lever, ensuring that it 'shall not be accidentally moved by
wind, or other cause, until acted on by the powerful grasp of the magnets.
'This instrument was found to answer admirably well. It may be observed, in passing,
that it gives the means of exploding mines at almost any distance, through telegraphic
wires and by any moderate contact-making power, and may admit of yaluable applica-

tions hereafter for the explosion, at a determinate instant, of mines for purposes of
warfare.


It is obvious that a certain 7oss of time must occur at this contact-maker, in reference
to our experimentsâ€”that in fact the total time registered by the chronograph at D is
too great, by the minute interval that elapses between the arrival of the galvanic current
in the coils at a, and the dipping of the poles ff into the mercury-cups. With the same
battery power at E and conducting-wires, this delay is practically constant. Its amount,
however, required to be determined, and the time, when converted into distance, added
to the gross transit-rate previously ascertained. s

For this purpose the following little apparatus was employed. Its principle, though

not the precise details of its construction, is shown in fig. 6, Plate XXIII. Upon a yer-
tical steel spindle (s) revolving upon an agate step at bottom, and in a polished brass
collar at top, a cylindric barrel is placed of 1 inch diameter, having an escapement-wheel
and anchor escapement (v) at its lower end, all the parts being made as light as possible.
