It is to be noticed that these calculated pressures are in substantial agreement
with my experiments on the fracturing of glass tubes by the explosion of carbonic
oxide and of cyanogen with oxygen ; and also that the minimum pressures calculated
for the diluted electrolytic gas are close to 30 atmospheres—the pressure required to
- fire electrolytic gas by the heat of compression. Nore sy Proressor Arruur Scuusrer, F.R.S.

In 1859 Riewann* deduced an equation for the propagation of abrupt variations in the density and
pressure of a gas, on the supposition that such an abrupt variation could be propagated without change
of type. Lord Rayieicnt criticising this investigation, draws attention to the fact that a steady wave
