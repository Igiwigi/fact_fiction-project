On the morning of the 10th the tube nsed on the preceding day was washed with

2 In fact it was impoxsible to avoid seeing the relationship of both. Previous to this
Sentry the blue had attracted my attention. It was unfailing it its appearance when the
S action was low. The blue colour was in all cases the herald of the denser actinic cloud.

< mining whether in all its bearings and phenomena the blue light was not identical with
S the light of the sky. This to the most minute detail appears to be the case. The inci-

A are manifested by these blue actinic clonds; and that they exhibit additional phenomena
which it would be neither convenient to pursue, nor perhaps possible to detect, upon
the actual firmament. They enable us, for example, to follow the growth and modifica-
