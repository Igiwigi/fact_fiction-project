being necessary to aid the digestion of wood by the host Termites. They claim that
the necessity of these organisms is not proved, and further add that, in many other
wood-feeding insects, the intermediary Protozoa are not required. No concrete
cases are quoted, however, in support of the latter statement. Grassi mentions that

he has tried reagents partly similar to those used by Buscatton1 and Comes, advised
also by the botanist Baccarrni, who was at that time his colleague at Catania. He
states that he did not venture to draw any definite conclusions therefrom, especially
when it is taken into account the fact that many animals take in a much larger
quantity of food than they can utilise. Before this matter is passed out among the
feces it serves to nourish the Protozoan parasites. It does not follow, therefore,
that the latter are necessary for the welfare of their host. Grassr admits the
difficulty of definitely proving his thesis, and adds that long and intricate physio-
logical research is required, not only on the Protozoa, but also on the digestive
processes of the Termites. He mentions an important experiment which he con-
ducted with Calotermes. Pieces of wood containing individuals of this Termite
(caste not stated) were enclosed in small boxes and kept at a temperature of about
35Â° C. The intestinal Protozoa died, sometimes all, often only the small forms
remained alive. In this way he found that the Calotermes were without such
usually plentiful forms as Jenia and Mesojenia. In other cases the Calotermes
were entirely deprived of Protozoa and lived im full activity for several
