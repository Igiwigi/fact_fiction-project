The external forms of all bodies in nature may be changed in a greater or less
degree, and without producing discontinuity in their mass or destruction of their internal
structure, by the action of any external forces, the original or undisturbed form from
which the change of form is to be estimated being that which the body would assume
if acted on by no external forces whatever. This change of form necessarily implies a
change in the relative positions of the component particles of the mass, or a certain
greater or smaller amount of molecular mobility, or power in the particles of moving
inter 88. We may speak either of the general change of the form of the whole body, or
of that which takes place in each of its 8mall elementary portions ; it is, in fact, in this
latter sense that we are obliged to regard it in any accurate investigations, because the
change of form for different elements will usually be different. Change of form in an
element may or may not be accompanied by a change of its volume. In the first case it

leads to eubical extension or compression ; in the latter, merely to extension or compres-
sion of the surface and not the volume of the element, which may be called 8uperficial
extension or compression.
