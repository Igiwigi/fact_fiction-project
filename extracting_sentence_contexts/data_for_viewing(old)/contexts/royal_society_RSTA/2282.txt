Note that i =—étré =?, A, describes the ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole when A(r) =0, and By,
describes the Dirac-type hypercharge Abelian monopole when B(r) = 0. Of course, € and B,, have
an apparent string singularity along the negative z-axis, but this singularity is a pure gauge
artefact which can easily be removed making the U(1)y bundle non-trivial [13]. Moreover, it has
the Coulomic part A(r) and B(r) which could add the electric charge. So the above ansatz describes
a most general spherically symmetric ansatz of an electroweak dyon.

Here, we emphasize the importance of the non-trivial nature of U(1)y gauge symmetry to make
the ansatz spherically symmetric. Without the extra U(1)y the Higgs doublet does not allow a
spherically symmetric ansatz. This is because the spherical symmetry for the gauge field involves
the embedding of the radial isotropy group SO(2) into the gauge group that requires the Higgs
field to be invariant under the U(1) subgroup of SU(2). This is possible with a Higgs triplet, but
not with a Higgs doublet [83]. In fact, in the absence of the U(1)y degrees of freedom, the above
ansatz describes the SU(2) sphaleron which is not spherically symmetric [84-86].

To see this, one might try to remove the string in € with the U(1) subgroup of SU(2). But this
U(1) will necessarily change 7 and thus violate the spherical symmetry. This means that there is
no SU(2) gauge transformation which can remove the string in € and at the same time keeps the
spherical symmetry intact. The situation changes with the inclusion of the U(1)y in the standard
model, which naturally makes & a CP’ field [13]. This allows the spherical symmetry for the Higgs
doublet.

To understand the physical meaning of the ansatz, we have to express it in terms of the
physical fields. There are two ways to do that. We can go to the unitary gauge with the gauge
