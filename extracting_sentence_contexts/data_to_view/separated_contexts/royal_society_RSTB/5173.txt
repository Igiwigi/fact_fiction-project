There now seems scarcely any doubt that it belongs to the same geological horizon. Tn this specimen the stem was not preserved, but a dozen finger-thick petioles, embedded
in a packing of adventitious roots, had their bundles rather regularly orientated ; it
was concluded that the leaves had been preserved in their natural positions with respect
to the missing “ stem,” which no doubt was erect. ‘The facts suggested, at the time, the
picture of a tree-fern of medium size with a single central axis surrounded by a thick zone
of leaf-bases in several cycles. The fossil was apparently a part of this peripheral zone. From an examination of this specimen, which is the only one yet figured or fully
described, it thus seemed obvious that C. australis was “ a fair-sized tree-fern resembling
the fossil Osmundacew.”
