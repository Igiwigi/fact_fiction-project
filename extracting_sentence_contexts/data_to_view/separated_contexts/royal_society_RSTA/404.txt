For example, pallets inside a container of strawberries shipped across
the continental USA will have up to 5°C temperature differential depending on where they
are placed inside the container, causing a notable difference in their quality and shelf life [49]. Hence, a temperature-controlled container’s set point is an extremely poor approximation of the
actual product temperature. In fact, inconsistency in the quality of fresh produce from the same
field can only be explained by temperature variations that it might have encountered during
transportation, which can only be measured by a better quality monitoring system using higher
resolution than the container level. Even though the majority of the articles discuss loss reduction, a key advantage of FEFO-
enabled cold chains is the provision of consistent quality to all the stakeholders, which also
improves the forecasting accuracy and the profits. Different companies might have different
priorities, such as offering high-quality /high-cost or low-quality /low-cost perishables depending
on their customer base.
