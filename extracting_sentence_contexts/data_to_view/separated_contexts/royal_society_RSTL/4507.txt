Other forms have
been adopted, particularly those snggested by Mr. Kexxepy of Liver-
pool, alluded to in the Appendix. Having carefully investigated the different properties of wrought iron in its varied
forms of construction, and conceiving that the resalts obtained from the experiments
may be useful in a variety of circumstances connected with the useful arts, I have
endeayoured to collect them in the abstract, in order that the practical builder and
engineer may the more readily ascertain the comparative value of the different forms
of beams, the properties of the material, and their adaptation to any particular con-
struction in which he may be engaged. Should further information be required, we
must then refer to the experiments, in which will be found the facts more in detail,
and which are probably better calculated to satisfy the inquiring mind and to effect
that conviction essential to success. I have not attempted any inquiry into the laws of oxidation, the adhesion of bar-
nacles and marine vegetation, and the means necessary to prevent such evils. This
is a subject which does not come within the province of the present inquiry, and
more properly belongs to that of the chemist.
