Sobtained, when a difference of potential of 240 volts was maintained between the
luminium and the water during the exposure and till after the expansion had been
Amade, were again indistinguishable in appearance from those obtained in the absence
of any difference of potential.

On exposing the air to Réntgen rays, instead of ultra-violet light, the expansion
being the same as before (gauge reading = 183), very dense fogs were obtained in the
absence of electromotive force, while, when a difference of potential of 240 volts was
maintained between the metal and water surfaces, only a very slight fog appeared on
expansion. An expansion of the same amount, made 3 seconds after the rays were
cut off, gave a fog in the absence of any difference of potential, whereas, when the
potential difference amounted to 240 volts, no drops at all were produced, even when
the expansion was brought about 2 seconds after cutting off the rays. In fact, with

the difference of potential just mentioned, no nuclei could be detected if the rays were
cut off before the expansion, even if this were effected as quickly as possible after the
rays were stopped. On the other hand, when no electromotive force was applied,
some of the nuclei lasted for at least 10 seconds after the rays were cut off, a shower
being even then obtained on expansion.

There is thus a very marked difference in the behaviour of the nuclei according as
they are produced by Réntgen rays or ultra-violet rays, the nuclei produced by the
