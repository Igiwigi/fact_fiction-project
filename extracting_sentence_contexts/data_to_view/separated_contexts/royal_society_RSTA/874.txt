The spin relaxation time T> is also
shown in figure 5c. Tz = 95 + 20 ps (70 + 15 ps) for Al that was 8.5 nm (6 nm) thick. Both the order
of magnitude of T2 , as well as the fact that it is inversely proportional to the film thickness, are
consistent with spin coherence limited primarily by the Elliott-Yafet spin-orbit scattering time
Tso [46,47]. Further, these figures agree with an independent, equilibrium measurement of ts
(figure 5d). We note that, unlike normal metals, where Tz =T1, the spin imbalance relaxation time, in
superconductors T is much larger than Tz, and that T2 is of the order of the spin imbalance
relaxation time measured in the normal state [56,57], consistent with plural sources and relaxation
mechanisms of spin imbalance in the superconducting state [87].
