There is also a Neoproterozoic increase the observed minimum carbonate 87Sr /86Sr ratios [99]
that, in the traditional framework, could be linked to an increase in the extent of continental
exposure. A Neoproterozoic increase in continental exposure is difficult to reconcile with our
freeboard model results. In fact, no model scenarios show a pronounced and sustained shift in
continental exposure in the Neoproterozoic. Accumulation of radiogenic sedimentary Sr isotope
values in the upper crust after extensive continental exposure should provide a ‘buffer’ that
prevents swings to low seawater ®”Sr/*°Sr ratios during times of more limited continental input. This buffering mechanism should have become established 250 to 500 Myr (several half lives of
the upper continental crust [100]) after extensive continental exposure (in the Late Archean in our


results)—so at first glance this process is an unlikely explanation for the disagreement between the
freeboard model results and the current carbonate Sr isotope curve.
