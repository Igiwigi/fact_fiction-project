Then there exist constants hg > 0, co > 0 and cy < 00, all depending on as,r9 and R, such that for any

where the correction x(t) := exp(ci (log py log(log t)) grows slower than t* for any a > 0.

As the minimum of the effective functional gives the leading-order elastic energy as h > 0,
it is important to note that its minimizer can be made entirely explicit. In fact, assuming


as in theorem 2.1 that as; <2~8(r9/R)* and using the Euler-Lagrange equation for Fo, it is
straightforward to compute that
