systems known, while Gleichenia has a simple cylindrical stele. On the other
hand, the genera Gileichenia, Matonia, Loxsoma, Hymenophyllum, Trichomanes,
Dennstedtia, Microlepia, and Hypolepis all have either a single solid stele, or a
cylindrical one, with or without internal accessory steles. This may be a mere
concomitant of the creeping habit and solitary insertion of the leaves. But whatever
the reason, it provides material for interesting comparisons.* The vascular supply to
‘the leaf, and its mode of insertion on that of the axis also provides useful facts. A
single stele enters the petiole in Osmunda, Matonia, Loxsoma, Schizeacea,
Gleicheniacew, Hymenophyllaces, &e. The uniformity of this simple condition
becomes the more important when it is remembered how frequently in Ferns with a
mixed sorus the leaf-trace is composed of numerous smaller steles.

It appears that the general arrangement of the vascular system will fairly
countenance a relationship between the tribes of Ferns above named, and especially
of the Gradatee with such genera as Gileichenia and Matonia. It will remain for
more detailed work to show how far these comparisons may be pressed ; meanwhile,
I see in the anatomical data no obstacle to the grouping proposed, but rather a
measure of support for it.
