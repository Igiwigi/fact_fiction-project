Dawsoni,
the vascular bundles of each pair come off as branches from the corresponding foliar
bundle. In certain cases also the pedicels are coalescent at the base. Such facts as
these would be compatible with fission of sporangiophores, similar to that process
which has led not uncommonly to an increase in number of stamens in the flowers
of Angiosperms.+ But lateral fission, if it did oceur, cannot account for all cases of
more numerous sporangiophores ; in S. Roemeri they appear, from the description of

* It may be noted that the alternate and verticillate arrangements of leaves are both represented in the
gents Lycopodium, while some species show intermediate conditions between the two.

+ Chorisis of the pedicels has already been suggested by Scorr in the case of S. Dawsoni, “On
Cheirostrobus,” p. 27.
