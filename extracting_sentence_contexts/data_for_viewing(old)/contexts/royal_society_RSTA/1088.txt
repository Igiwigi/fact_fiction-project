In addition to the wall modelling, an open-source synthetic turbulence generator is applied to
prescribe velocity fluctuations as a turbulent inlet flow boundary condition for each flow stream
separately following [21,22]. This works by coupling a synthetic turbulence generator box of the
same extent as the bypass and core inlet boundary face. Every time step the box velocity values
are interpolated onto the boundary face coordinates. The fluctuations are added to the mean
velocity part of the local Riemann invariants corresponding to the incoming waves of the one-
dimensional characteristic boundary conditions, which are defined at each nozzle stream inlet
based on the operational jet conditions [16,18,24]. There are two coupling parameters that control
the amplitude and the time scale of the synthetic turbulence.

The use of the synthetic turbulence generator is motivated by the fact that although there are
no data on turbulence measurements inside the CoJeN nozzles, boundary layers at the nozzle exit
of a jet flow at the Reynolds number of the CoJeN jets are expected to be fully turbulent. Hence,
in the absence of the experimental data and following the standard practice to prescribe inflow
conditions in the jet LES literature [25], the amplitude parameter of the synthetic turbulence
generator is chosen such that at the nozzle exit the average turbulent velocity fluctuations are
around 3% of the stream-wise velocity. The time scale of the synthetic turbulence generator that
scales with the stream-wise flow velocity inside the nozzle is adjusted accordingly so that the
generated turbulent eddies are captured within several grid cells of the boundary layer, hence,
allowing the CABARET solution to propagate a significant part of the synthetic turbulence from
the inlets to the nozzle exit without strong dissipation. Before applying to the CoJeN nozzles, the
parameters of the inflow synthetic turbulent conditions are verified on a flat plate flow test case.
