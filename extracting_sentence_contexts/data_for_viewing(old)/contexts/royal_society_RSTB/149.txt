siderable length, terminating in the descending aorta about half the breadth of a
vertebra nearer the head than the place of termination of its neighbour of the left side.

Fig. 1, Plate 22, shows the ductus arteriosi of the Nandu (Rhea americana).

A vestige of the fourth left arch is present in a few Birds. I have not been for-
tunate enough to obtain for dissection any of the species in which this structure is
found, but Professor A. Macatister, of Cambridge, has kindly furnished me with
particulars from his own dissections. He has found it as a well-marked cord in the
Osprey (Pandion haliattus) and White-tailed Eagle (Haliattus albicilla), and some
other Raptores. He has also noticed it, but less distinctly, in some of the larger Gulls,
especially in Lestris pomarinus and Larus marinus. When present it stretches from
the innominate artery to the aorta as a ligamentous cord. This fact agrees very
closely with what I have observed to be the method of its disappearance, described
later.

ScHEME OF DEVELOPMENT ACCORDING TO RATHKE.

General accounts of the development of the arterial system in Birds will be found
in all works upon Embryology, but the best and most detailed is probably that of
Fosrer and Batrour.t Fig. 2, copied from RaruKe,§ explains the general system.
