The most significant feature of these results is the fact that the central intensities
for the three lines of the Diffuse series of Helium are the same on both photographs.
When their heights were found to be the same in both eases, they were re-examined,
and no difference can be detected. The fact that their “absolute” heights were
identical was of course accidental. At the same time the shapes of the lines are quite
different (Plate 3), for \4472 is very much broader, and therefore contains, for the
same height, very much more energy. The same applies to \4026, and to a less
extent to \5876, but the increase in \5876 is not comparable with that in \4472 or
even 44026. Weare in the presence of the same phenomenon as before, but with the
difference, that whereas in the bulb the transfer to higher members of the series takes
the form of increased central intensity but not increase of breadth, with the con-
densed discharge the extra energy goes into the form of increased breadth.
