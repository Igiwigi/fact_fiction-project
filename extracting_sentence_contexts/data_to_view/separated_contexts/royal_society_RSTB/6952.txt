In these mice, even after a week, mitotic activity
continued to be abnormally high in all cells. The conclusions are reached that the agent responsible for the mitotic activity comes
from the wound itself, and that it does not exert its effect in the same way as an oestrogen. The facts are more easily explained by a theory that the wounded tissue emits not a
mitosis stimulator, but something which eliminates cell inertia from all the neighbouring
cells. Thus, whatever may be their normal reactions to the oestrogens, all cells are now
able to react fully and simultaneously to the presence of even minimal concentrations of
these hormones, and in the same way the action of any mitosis depressor is prevented for
as long as the wound remains open.

(ii) Mammary cancer

Mitotic activity is cyclic in the ducts, as well as in the secretory cells, of the normal
mammary gland, a maximum rate of cell division occurring on the third day of dioestrus
and again in late oestrus, while in a mammary carcinoma the rate of division of the
malignant cells is rapid and sustained. In the normal gland, mitosis is kept under control
by the forces of cell inertia and mitosis depression, but in the cancerous gland these con-
trols are lacking.
