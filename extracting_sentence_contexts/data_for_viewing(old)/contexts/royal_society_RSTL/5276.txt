reaction of the liquid begins to appear ; that the products of the action do not differ
essentially from those due to the action of acids and alkalies ; that the formation of
alizarine in about the same proportion as when acids or alkalies are employed is one
of the results of the process, and that yeast exerts no decomposing power on rubian
whatever. Hence it necessarily follows, that if the purpurine of WoLey and STRECKER
be not found as such among the products of the fermentation of rubian, it must consist
of a mixture of two or more of those products.

Now I have mentioned in the first part of this paper, that though alizarine and
verantine are both perfectly insoluble in boiling alum liquor when acted on sepa-
rately, yet that when a mixture of both is employed, the mixture is found to be
soluble in alum liquor with the colour characteristic of purpurine. Hence I con-
cluded that purpurine is in fact a mixture of those two substances, a view with
which all that is mentioned regarding purpurine completely coincides, I may mention

meidentally, that in making this experiment it is necessary to treat the verantine
with a little dilute nitric acid, in order to destroy the alizarine which usually accom-
panies it, and then to remove the acid by washing with water before employing it,
and that it generally succeeds best when a large excess of alizarine is used.

To this synthetical proof of the opinion here advocated, I will now add a few
analytical ones. I will show, in the first place, that purpurine prepared in the manner
