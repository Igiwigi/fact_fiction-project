little, but no great difference between the species has been found.

The puparium

In many respects the puparium and the adult Glossina are extremely different.
The adult lives actively in an aerial environment, under climatic conditions which
change continually ; at any rate at 30° C its optimum is in the middle of the range
of humidity ; its weight and composition change rapidly, in response to external
conditions and also because it feeds, digests, and excretes. The puparium lies
inactive in the soil, where rapid changes of temperature and humidity do not generally
occur ; its optimum humidity is high ; it neither feeds nor excretes.

A remarkable fact about the puparium is the great range in weight, among
individuals weighed when they were under 24 hours old. The coefficient of variation
of Glossina tachinoides was 19-2, of submorsitans 14-8. This is apparently an effect
of captivity, though the precise explanation is unknown ; it is not simply that the
births in the cages are premature, for the puparia are both larger and smaller than
those produced in nature. But whatever the cause may be, the effect is far-reaching,
for the weight of the puparium is closely related to that of the adult which it produces.
One should therefore be cautious in applying observations made on flies bred in
captivity to problems in the field.

A number of factors which might affect the weight of the puparium were studied.
It is probable that sex is a factor, for we know that unfed males weigh significantly _
less than females, Tables IX—XI. But when we tabulated weights of puparia (on
