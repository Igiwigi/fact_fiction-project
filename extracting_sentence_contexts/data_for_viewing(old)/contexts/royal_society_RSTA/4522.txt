that many mRNA sequences have slow codons positioned close to the initiation site [38,39].

When considering a codon species whose tRNA delivers an amino acid which is not subject
to starvation, we find that the charging level of this species can in fact increase in response
to starvation. This agrees with previous studies which suggest that tRNA charging levels
depend on the balance between their supply and demand [20,3740], and the phenomenon
has also been observed experimentally [3]. Reduced protein production from some mRNAs
can free up resources, which can then be used by other mRNAs leading to increased
protein production.

In contrast with previous models we have explicitly taken the codon sequence into account.
Our description is, however, deterministic and is essentially a mean field treatment. This latter
point refers to the fact that as y; refers to an average over mRNAs (see §2), we do not take into
account any spatial correlations in the density. Although correlations are likely to have a large
impact on density profiles around bottleneck sites, by comparing with stochastic models which do
take correlations into account [19,41] we predict that the overall behaviour is unlikely to change
qualitatively. We have also neglected any active variation in the initiation rate which may result as
the cell actively responds to starvation: for example, the GCN pathway [4,31] gives rise to a global
reduction in initiation rate, while other pathways act to increase or reduce translation of specific
mRNA species. Indeed other recent work [42] has shown a complex interplay between translation
initiation and ribosome recycling (where interactions between the ends of an mRNA molecule
lead to an increased likelihood of a terminating ribosome to re-bind at the 5’ end); together these


effects highlight the complexity of translation regulation. Nevertheless, by keeping ka constant
