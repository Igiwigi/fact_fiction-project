Material and methods

Our approach relies on the use of a subset of the EHR data for the identification of the target
population, whereas the remaining EHR information can be included in predictive tools merging
information from both EHRs and waveform data sources. This would imply the use of some of
the information contained in the EHRs for the study design process and adding the remaining
information with the continuous waveform features for the realization of the desired model. We take advantage of the fact that signals like ECG and blood pressure, when properly
processed, are able to provide additional knowledge on how the different underlying
physiological mechanisms, e.g. the patients’ autonomic activity, behave and interact with the
others, e.g. the cardiovascular system [31,32]. This additional point of view highlights the
advantage of using all the wide spectrum of information contained in the EHRs, where many
of the clinical features (e.g. laboratory test, antibiotics prescriptions, microbiology test) are
considered as the gold standard or the best available markers for the identification of specific
pathological conditions, providing reliable estimates of the patient cohort. From this perspective, the presented study focuses the use of this original framework on the
identification of sepsis.
