extension of the classical duality between algebraic and geometric objects. This duality may be
reinterpreted in terms of the syntax—-semantics duality and this is an idea we will have in mind in a
this paper. [=

From a mathematical point of view, the main idea of our project consists in establishing a :8
rigorous duality :

Here V4 is a multi-sorted structure, each sort of which is a Zariski geometry (a notion to be defined in tw
§2). An essential part of the multi-sorted structure V_4 are morphisms between sorts functorially :
agreeing with embeddings between certain sub algebras of A, which makes the left-to-right arrow :g
a functor between a category of those subalgebras A and sorts V4 of Vy. This functor, in fact, :8
defines a quite rich sheaf over the category of subalgebras. This makes an interesting point of :
contact of our approach with the topos-theoretic approach to foundations of physics suggested
by Isham and Butterfield and developed by Isham, Déring and others; see [4]. In that approach,
V. is supposed to be a topos.

From [1], we have the duality between rational Weyl algebras A and corresponding (quantum)
Zariski geometries V4. The structure V, encapsulates the representation theory of A. In [2], these
ideas are used to extend the duality on algebras A approximated by rational Weyl algebras.
This requires the development of a notion of approximation on the side of the structures V4,
which is also done there. In this paper, we are going to summarize the constructions in the
referred paper and discuss their relevance for physics. More precisely, it will be shown that those
constructions yield that quantum mechanics is represented in the limit of one particular module
