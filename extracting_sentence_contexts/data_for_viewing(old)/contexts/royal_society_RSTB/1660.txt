Frexp (Lit., No. 42) described and figured it as “ Intrachordal-Knorpel” in Amphiuma.
In Anura it is only Gorrre (Lit., No. 54, p. 395-897, 387-389) who mentioned chordal
cartilage, giving a somewhat incoherent accountof conversion of thechorda intocartilage.
This “chordal, intravertebral, or intrachordal ” cartilage has been almost completely
ignored in the various text-books. (WuiepersHeErM, ‘ Grundriss d. vergl. Anatomie’
(1893), p. 61, fig. 41, has marked it CK., which was intended undoubtedly for Chorda-
Knorpel, but he calls it “intervertebrale Knorpel und Fettzellen.”) Perhaps one of
the reasons of this neglect is that this cartilage is rather late and somewhat erratic in
its occurrence. I myself have found no trace of it in about 600 consecutive sections
through the posterior half of the trunk of Salamandra maculosa, a specimen just
metamorphosed ; nor did I find any in the tail and posterior trunk of nearly adult
Triton cristatus. GEGENBAUR saw it in larve of 7. cristatus, but not in those of
T. teniatus. The fact is, that this cartilage appears first in the cervical region, and
proceeds towards the tail, which it may, however, never reach. It is present in the
whole trunk of probably all fully adult Urodela, but morphological investigations,
being by predilection restricted to sections of limited portions of embryos and
larvee, fail in many cases to reveal what is disclosed by comparison of older specimens
and of several species.

Lvorr (Lit., No. 69, 1887, p. 462) was the first positively to contradict the supposed
chordal origin of this cartilage. ‘Der Knorpel, welcher sich in der Chorda befindet
(Axolotl), wird nicht, wie Ge@znBAUR und GorrTe meinen, von Elementen der Chorda
gebildet, sondern wiichst.aus dem Perichordalgewebe (skeletogenous layer) hinein und
zerstért die Chorda in der Vertebralregion, indem er sie hier einschniirt. Auf der
Chorda-Oberfliche befinden sich Chorda-Epithelzellen,” Invasion of the chordal sheath
