therefore, one would expect the ratios to be 1:3:
types of train have been observed and the dispersions are indeed in these ratios.

The variations of the occurrence of the two types of whistler (figures 10 and 11) seem
capable of simple explanation in this way. Thus the fact that fewer whistlers are heard during
the day than the night is ascribed to the action of absorption in the lower ionosphere, and
the asymmetry of the daily variation records about midnight to the circumstance that
thunderstorm activity is greatest in the late afternoon. Likewise the increase in the numbers
of the long whistlers from winter to summer agrees with the known seasonal variation of

thunderstorm activity, while the accompanying decrease in the numbers of short whistlers

is explained by the fact that the seasons alternate in the two hemispheres. We defer dis-
cussion of the effect of magnetic activity on the incidence of whistlers, here noting only that

since thunderstorms and magnetic activity are not related the effect must be one on the

conditions of propagation over the whistler path.
14, THE OUTER IONOSPHERE
The dispersion of a whistler is deducible from equation (15) ifthe magnetic field and the
electron density are known at all points along its path. According to our assumption the
wave packet travels along a line of magnetic force, so that both the path and the magnitude
of the field are known. If the electron density is taken to be that for an /, layer with a
Chapman distribution of electrons and a maximum electron density of 10Â° cm~*, a typical
