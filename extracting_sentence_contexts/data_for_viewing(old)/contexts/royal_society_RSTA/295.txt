of spatial gradients of signalling molecules called morphogens, causing cells in different positions
to express different sets of genes. Gene expression levels will need to vary significantly, as we
move across segment boundaries: small changes in the levels of a signalling molecule must be
amplified to produce large changes in expression. New transcription factors will be synthesized,
triggering a subsequent round of gene expression. Cells will need to respond rapidly to these
changes. At this stage, small errors in expression patterns must be avoided, as they would lead to
larger and possibly lethal errors in downstream processes. The morphogen signals will eventually
start to die away; the cells must nevertheless retain some memory of these signals, remaining
firmly committed to their different fates. Developmental processes in different parts of the embryo
will need to be synchronized: protein levels will need to oscillate periodically in time. And the list
goes on.

The surprising fact is, each of the tasks on our wish-list can be achieved by small networks
of interacting genes (figure 4) [32,33]. In ยง4b, we survey a few simple networks that are
able to generate, in principle, these various biologically desirable outcomes. Over the past
decade systems such as those discussed here have been explored experimentally by synthetic
biologists [34-36]: negative feedback for noise reduction [37,38]; positive feedback and the
flip-flop for bistability [20,3941]; and hysteretic and ring oscillators [26,4244].

Amplification by cooperative activation: consider a gene that encodes a protein Y and is regulated
by an activator X (figure 52). Cooperative interactions can result in a Hill-type dependence of the
