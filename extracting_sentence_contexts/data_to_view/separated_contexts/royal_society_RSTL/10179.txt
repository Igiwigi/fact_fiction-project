FE. B. WILSON ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENILLA.

[Appendiz.—During the passage of this paper through the press, T have discovered
in several genera of Aleyonaria that the dorsal filaments are, in fact, ectodermic
downgrowths from the stomodznm, whereas the 8ix others are strictly entodermic
structures. My failure to recognise this fundamental difference was due to the
circumstance that the entodermic filaments become at an early stage perfectly con-
tinuous with the stomodzal ectoderm, like the dorsal filaments, and my most
favourable sections happened to be in every case through the entodermic filaments,
For a description of these new observations I must refer to a forthcoming paper
in the © Mittheilungen aus der Zoologischen Station zu Neapel.'—Naples, September
20, 1883.]
