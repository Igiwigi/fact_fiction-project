materials are derived from the adjacent hills, caps the gypseous loam, but there
is no mention of any breccias or of ossiferous fissures in that district.
Tripoli—Judging from a remark of M. Pomet, I should imagine that the Quater-
nary loam of South Tunis ranged into Tripoli, and eastward toward the Lybian
desert, but details are wanting.

The evidence thus far on the North African coast, imperfect as it is, shows the
persistence of the Raised Beaches; while, as we proceed from west to east, we have to
note the increasing rarity of Ossiferous Fissures so characteristic of the submerged
areas. Though of frequent occurrence in the neighbourhood of Oran, and not
uncommon in Algeria, there is no record of them in the provinces of Constantine
and Tunis. Ordinary surface breccias continue, however, into the former province.
These facts would seem to imply that, as on the coast, of Asia Minor, the depth of
the submergence decreased eastward, but closer investigation is needed (see Map).

Egypt.—It may be a question whether the submergence extended beyond the
Lybian desert. There is no well-defined evidence in proof of it in Egypt, for the
breccia described by General Prrr-Rivers near Thebes,{ and in which he found
chert or flint implements, does not appear to be a Rubble-drift, though it possesses
some of its characters. It is composed of débris of chert and limestone derived
from the adjacent hills, cemented together by carbonate of lime. In this, worked
chert flakes occurred at a depth of from 6 to 10 feet from the surface. That these
implements are of great antiquity is evident from the fact that there are tombs
excavated in the breccia which are supposed to be not less than 3500 years old.
There is, however, nothing in the shape of the implements to indicate their age, and
