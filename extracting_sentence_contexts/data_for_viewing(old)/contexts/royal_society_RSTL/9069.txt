by reference to the results here set forth. But above all the practical question arises:—
May not the surgeon have to fight sometimes against enemies like those here described ?
The particular germs with which T have been 80 long contending cause, as we have seen,
both fish and flesh to putrify. How would they behave in the wards of an hospital?
Can they canse wounds to putrify? and if s0, would they succumb to the disinfectants
usually applied? These are questions the weighty import of which will be best under-
stood by the enlightened follower of the antiseptic system, and which he will know how

Q to answer for himself.

i: I 20. Remarks on Acid, Neutral, and Alkaline Infusions.
0 In the foregoing section reference was made to the comparative deportment of acid
= and neutral infusions. There can be no doubt of the fact that, for the nutrition and
SD multiplication of Bacteria, acid infusions are less suitable than neutral or slightly alka-
I line ones. In acid infusions exposure to the common air sometimes copiously develops
= Penicillium, while it fails to develop Bacteria. It is also. true that exposure for
= a certain time to a certain temperature may in many cases prevent the appearance of
5 life in an acid infusion, and fail to prevent it in a neutral or slightly alkaline one.
S In the present inquiry this has been frequently found to be the case. I have many
S closed chambers, for example, to which the process of * discontinuous heating,” to be
V subsequently described, has been applied ; and with them it has proved a common expe-
IS rience that an amount of heating which has rendered acid infusions of hay permanently
Z barren has failed to sterilize the corresponding neutral infusions. Moreover, in the cases
= Just recorded, where single bulbs escaped sterilization though exposed for five, six, and
= eight hours to the boiling temperature, it was always a neutral bulb that kindled into life.
