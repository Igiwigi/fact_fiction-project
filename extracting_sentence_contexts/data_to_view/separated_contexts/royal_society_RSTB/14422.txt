Likewise, the frequency of male nivoran, ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua) [111-113] adult
coalitions was not higher in sexually dimorphic species (OR females but not males form intragroup coalitions, generally

probability OR>1=44%), but somewhat higher in species female African bush elephants (Loxodonta africana) form
with male philopatry compared with male dispersal (OR = intragroup coalitions to protect their offspring [114,115], but
1.29, 90% CI=0.51-2.27, probability OR > 1 = 73%). male elephants do not participate in intragroup coalitions. This may be related to the fact that bachelor males spend
much of their time alone and, thus, have relatively few
opportunities to form intragroup coalitions. Among the 39 species of primates included in our dataset;
intragroup coalitions were found within both sexes for most
species (90%). Male-only and female-only coalitions are = =
