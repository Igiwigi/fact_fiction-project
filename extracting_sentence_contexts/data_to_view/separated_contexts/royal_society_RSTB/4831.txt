P. CHATTOCK ON THE PHYSICS OF INCUBATION. 415

for turning of the eggs, and its values in this case are also given for comparison. An increase in the number of eggs per hatch should, of course, reduce the R.M.S.,
and in both the cooling and the turning figures there is, in fact, a drop shown of about
the same amount in each, when we pass from the small to the large numbers of eggs. The drop is, however, only from 10-3 to 8-3, or 24 per cent. in the case of the
cooling experiments, and from 6-7 to 5-2, or 29 per cent., for those on turning ; while,
as the corresponding changes in the numbers of eggs are respectively seven- and nine-fold,
much larger reductions in the R.M.S. might have been expected. That these did not
oceur may have been for the following reason.
