at successive unit intervals of time after the arrival of p, at the lower edge, whilst the 7-even
F! and r-odd F, functions form a similar set with time measured from the arrival of p, at
the upper edge. Having obtained the solution for /,, equations 1(9) and I(1) then give
the formal explicit solution for the pressure everywhere.

The solution for p, corresponds to the physical process of the external incident field
producing diffraction waves Fy, Fj at the two edges which are then each incident on the
further edge to produce Fj, F respectively and so on. An alternative method of solution
could be based on this process, ab initio, by assuming the forms (25) and (26), where F,
F) are the solutions for each half-plane in the absence of the other and any subsequent F,, ,
or F’ , , is the lialf-plane solution due to the effective incident field of the preceding diffraction
wave from the other edge. When using this direct physical procedure, it is essential to use
the fact pointed out earlier (§2) that a diffraction wave from an edge is not in general a
separate physical entity but has a ‘cut-off’ and reflected wave associated with it. Thus
the solution I (161) applied to the lower half-plane involves the pressures in the incident
field for all y>0, x = 0, and when considering F,(Y, 72) as being produced by the incident
field of the first diffraction wave from the upper edge we must include the associated cut-off
wave as part of this field; this wave leads to the negative /; term in equation (28). Since
F,, F, and all subsequent waves are produced by incident fields arriving from directly
above or below the relevant edge, they have zero associated cut-off and reflected waves and
can be considered each as a separate incident field as indicated by the form of equation (29).

Provided the possible effect of associated cut-off waves is borne in mind, this separate
consideration of the constituent waves of the effective incident field is possibly simpler in
use, since it is easier to think of these waves being separately incident on the second half-
