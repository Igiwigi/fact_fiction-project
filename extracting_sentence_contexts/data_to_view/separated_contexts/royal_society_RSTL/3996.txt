© The fossil organisms termed by Exrenser Xanthidia, which have long been known
Z in flint, and were formerly considered to be siliceons, have been shown by Mr.
2 Deaxe to occur in the chalk in a similar condition to the Rotalie ; an unequivocal
S proof of the flexible nature of the original (see fig. 1). © That the correctness of the statements embodied in the preceding remarks may be
verified, I snbmit the specimens to the Royal Society for examination under the
2 microscope. = I will only add, that if the explanation T have suggested of the facts described be
'> correct, and the fossils before us are the delicate soft parts of animalcules preserved
EZ in chalk and flint, in like manner as the bodies of mollusks occur as a carbonaceous
'& substance in the Wealden freshwater limestones—this discovery, though relating to
'= &ome of the minutest forms of existence, may yet prove an important element in
'S many of the most interesting speculations of the geologist ; for in strata in which
SZ No vestiges of shells, corals, or other dense organisms have been detected, the relics
= of countless myriads of beings may lie concealed®,

S * In confirmation of these views I may tate, that Dr. BaiLey, Professor of Chemistry in the United States

Q Military Academy at West Point, whose high attainments as an accurate microscopical observer are well-
known, had arrived at the same conclusions, from the examination of American specimens, before he was ap-
prised of the result of my researches.
