This vertical folding, then, is further
confirmatory evidence of the asymmetry of the brains of the Australian. In the brain of the Southern Chinese the condition is found in twelve hemispheres,
eleven of which are on the right side. In five hemispheres the sulcus is confluent
with the parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the vertical folding
is in part the superior parallel sulcusâ€”ascending 1 of Kappers. So far nine hemispheres have been described in which the fissure of Sylvius bifur-
cates close to the sulcus centralis. All of them are on the right side and there is no
hemisphere in which the conditions described above occur on the left hemisphere.
