starvation can be realized, before showing that the same effects occur when we consider mRNA
sequences taken from the S. cerevisiae genome. We see that regulation of protein production can
be achieved through changes in the supply and demand of resources across all of the mRNAs in
the system, i.e. at the community level. It is possible to control how the protein production from
a specific mRNA species responds to changes in the community via a careful selection of coding
sequence. We thus propose that there may exist a direct and rapidly responding mechanism of
protein regulation at the translational level.

2. Model

Figure 1 illustrates the two main features of our translation model, namely (i) ribosome traffic
along mRNAs and (ii) the cycle of aminoacylation and usage of tRNAs. We also include explicitly
the fact that ribosomes extend over several codons and cannot overlap. We now describe each of
the aspects of the model in turn.

(a) Ribosome traffic

We derive a system of reaction rate equations for ribosome traffic on mRNAs by adapting a
model of translation in bacteria [21]. We consider explicitly that mRNAs are precise sequences
of different codons. Ribosomes bind to the mRNA with the rate kw, provided the initiation site


and the subsequent codons are vacant: 4 |
