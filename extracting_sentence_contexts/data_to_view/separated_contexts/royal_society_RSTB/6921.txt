In the normal
development, leaf growth is much more rapid on the abaxial than on the adaxial side, i.e. it
would appear that nutrient supply to the former is greater than to the latter. In these
experiments one effect of the system of incisions is to preclude the upward movement of
nutrients by way of the cortical and vascular tissues of the shoot to the primordium. In
fact, the supply of nutrients may be held to have become approximately uniform over the
whole cross-sectional area of the leaf-base—a condition which would in part account for
-the subsequent approximately symmetrical development of the isolated primordium. In
studies of rye embryos, de Ropp (1945) has shown that excised stem tips, when placed in
a culture medium, showed growth of the first leaf only. It was observed, however, that if
any isolated stem tip developed a root, ‘the entire growing point was stimulated to meri-
stematic activity, and leaves normal in form and size developed’.
