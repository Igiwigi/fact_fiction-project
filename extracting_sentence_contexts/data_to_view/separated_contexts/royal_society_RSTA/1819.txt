'= 0; . . . (18)

this is a quadratic for g*, whose solution may be written

1
g° =sin® $a (1 - a ; ici =i oe ena (1)
where @ is given by
cot 6 = AK’ cot? a—(tan’$a)/40. . . . . . . « (20)

The ambiguity is settled in practice by the fact that g? must be small if equation (14)
is to be taken as a first approximation to the solution. In practice, as we have said,
bissmall. Valuable information as to the nature of the solution is, therefore, obtainable
by considering its limit as b>0.
