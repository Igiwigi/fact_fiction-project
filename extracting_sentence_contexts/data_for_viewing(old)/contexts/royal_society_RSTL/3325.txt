purpose answered by the changes just mentioned as presented by the cells g', seems
to be that blood-corpuscles (cho.) find their way between them, and have space for
applying themselves to the membrane F, while this membrane continues to be pro-
tected by those cells. In fig. 8. several blood-corpuscles (cho.) are seen to have
occupied the latter situation, where, in some instances, they appear to effect the alter-
ations in their form above described$. Three of them, it will be observed, had become
cells, and two were in the same stage as s8ome of those in fig. 7, having begun to send
out, processes or arms||.

26. For the announcement that the chorion is formed by corpuscles of the Blood,
physiologists, I apprehend, are not prepared; it being the generally received opinion
that the formation and the nourishment of organs are effected through its fluid part}.
But the next section records facts which, if established by future observation, involve
more important consequences.

Muscular Fibre formed of Cells derived from Corpuscles of the Blood.

27. The latest researches, which have been published, on the mode of origin of
musecle, are I believe those of VarenTIN and SCHWANN.

poxsibly essential during the transit of the oyum into the Fallopian tube.
