Figure 3. Raw signal DSC curves of carbonate glass sample KMG8 containing initially 0.24 wt% bulk H,0 show below 120°C an
artificial broad peak during specific heat recording (transition from isothermal conditions to a dynamic heating segment). The
individual DSC curves show how successive reheating through the glass transition region shifts the glass transition temperature
to higher values as a result of dehydration. (Online version in colour.)

heating rate matching to the prior cooling rate (10 K min“; [37]).
