I observed in 1887 that an electro-deposit of iron on a clean copper plate wiil adh
so firmly to it that when they are severed by force a copper film is actually strip
from the copper plate and remains on the iron, thus affording clear evidence of
interpenetration of metals at the ordinary temperature. I found that this interpe:

Mytivus and Fromm have shown that metals interpenetrate and form alloys when
are precipitated by electrolysis from their aqueous solutions.t
The diffusion of metals in each other must be closely connected with the evaporati
of solid metals or alloys at temperatures far below their melting points, and it will b
well before describing the new experiments on diffusion in solid metals to briefh
recall the facts which are already known. It is not necessary to go further back ft
definite views on the subject than to the time of Boyix,{ who thought that “even sue
(bodies) as are solid may respectively have their little atmospheres,” . . . “for”
he adds, “ no man, I think, has yet tried whether glass, and even gold, may not in
length of time lose their weight.” t
Boyr's opinion was correct, for mercury which has been frozen by extreme cold
does, as Mercet§ showed two centuries later, evaporate into the atmosphere surround~
ing it ; a fact which is of much interest in connection with Gay Lussac’s well-known
observation that the vapours emitted by ice and by water both at 0°C. are of equal
tension, Drmargay|| has proved that in vacuo metals evaporate sensibly at lower:
temperatures than they do at the ordinary atmospheric pressure, and he suggests
that even metals of the platinum group will be found to be volatile at comparatively
low temperatures.
