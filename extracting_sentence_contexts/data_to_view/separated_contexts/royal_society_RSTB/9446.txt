The common ancestor of worms and humans already had a
complex nervous system and behaviour. Further impetus
to a change in thinking has come from finding that
genetic causes underlie some severe mental disorders—
diseases of the ‘mind,’ like schizophrenia and autism. Some
of these disorders may in fact be connectopathies caused
by mutations. In the end, it’s all coming together now, genetics and
physiology. As a measure of how far we have come, whereas
the White et al.’s paper [1] in 1986 was initially met with
indifference outside the community of C. elegans researchers,
the 2012 paper on the posterior connectome of the C. elegans
male [13] received the prize awarded each year by the Amer-
ican Association for the Advancement of Science for the most
outstanding research article published in its journal Science.
