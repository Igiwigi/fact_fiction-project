the margins of the tertiary traces (17).

Metaclepsydropsis dupler.—As in Diplolabis Romeri (18).

Stauropteris oldhamia.—Stem unknown, given off from the secondary, tertiary and
quaternary traces (4).

From the foregoing summary it will be seen that within the group the aphlebia traces
exhibit a wide variation as to source of origin, ranging from stem to ultimate pinnule
traces, and from general to localised distribution. Both source of origin and type of
distribution serve to render any attempt to determine their homologies peculiarly diffi-
cult, if not impossible. In the present state of our knowledge it seems soundest to
record the facts, and to defer interpretation until these facts are more numerous and
capable of closer co-ordination.

Affinities —Ankyropteris corrugata exhibits obvious affinities with the remaining plants
comprising the zygopterid alliance, sharing with them the stem stele, differentiated
into peripheral and central regions, and the monodesmic bipolar petiole trace, with its
characteristic type of symmetry and its protostelic method of departure. Within
that alliance the correctness of its assignation to the genus Ankyropteris is, I think,
undoubted. The structure of the petiolar stele, with its abaxially curved central bar
and its abaxial and adaxial antenne linked by a permanently closed filament of smaller
tracheids (39, 41, 46), is in close agreement with that of the remaining species of the
genus, the differences being merely differences of proportion. The stelar structure,
with its core of mixed tracheids and parenchyma, is also shared by those members of
