T, is the time intercept representing arrivals along layer n parallel to the interface.

The thicknesses of the various layers determined by the insertion of the experimental
results into these expressions are shown in figure 15.

Except for station 2 the thicknesses shown have been obtained by assumptions con-
cerning the similarities between the structures at the three positions. Thus, the limiting
velocity below the region of continuously increasing velocity has been assumed to be the
same for all three positions. The measurements obtained from stations 1 and 3 do not
allow the calculation of this limiting velocity with an accuracy as great as that obtainable
from station 2. The second assumption which has been made is that the velocity in the
layer lying above that with velocity 20400 ft./s (6-22 km/s) on station 3 is the same as that
of the analogous layer of station 2, namely, 16200 ft./s (4:94 km/s). In view of the fact
that a layer of similar velocity was also found under station 1 this assumption is the most
plausible.

It results, however, in the conclusion that the thickness of layer 1 is considerably less
than at the other two stations. With the positions of the observations as obtained by the
ship’s navigating officers this conclusion is geologically difficult to interpret. As will be
seen from figure 4 the shots for stations 1 and 3 are practically collinear, with the buoy
positions of the latter station being close to the more distant shots of the former. No
evidence for a component of dip in the direction of the line was obtained from either
station 1 or station 2. If it had exceeded 0-7° it would have been detected in the experi-
mental results of station 2 by the arrivals on the various buoys obtained from a single
‘depth charge lying on a line of different slope from the best straight line fitted to the
