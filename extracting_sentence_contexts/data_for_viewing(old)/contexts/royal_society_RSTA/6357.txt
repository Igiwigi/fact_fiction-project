corresponding to the position of intact vertical links. Additionally, the strength of the horizontal
links will play a role in the material's failure, providing new potential regimes of possible fracture.
Some of these regimes are discussed below in connection with the computations presented here
that are based on the analytical procedure of [36].

(i) Governing equations of the medium

During the bridge fracture process, the junctions along the upper row of the system are assumed
to undergo motion according to the following equation from [36]:

Mitm(t)—Qm(t) = HUm+1(t) + Um—1(t)) — 2(u + 26) (E), (2.6)

where Q,,(¢),  € Z, is an internal forcing term taking into account the fact that behind the crack
tip only the vertical links associated with odd-numbered nodes supply longitudinal forces to the
masses along the upper row. This term has the form

2 1), *, /
On(t) = xUm(t), m>m*, m even, (2.7)

0, otherwise.

Here, m* denotes the position of the failure front. Additionally, the form of Qm/(t) follows from the
assumption that the system’s displacements are symmetric relative to y=0. The displacements
Um(t) are assigned the following representation, which depends on the node location in the
medium:
