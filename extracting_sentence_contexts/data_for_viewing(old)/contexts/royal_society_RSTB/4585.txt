prominent chitinisation of the mouth-parts and the increasing development of
the eyes.

The exact number of moults which occur during the larval period I am unable to
definitely ascertain. Selected individuals were kept in captivity for the purpose of
noting the ecdyses. In order to make the necessary observations, it became
imperative to frequently split up the wood, into which the larvee gnaw their tunnels.
Information gathered by this means proved unreliable, owing to the discovery that
the larve often devour their exuvie, in fact, it was only on rare occasions that
exuvize were noted at all. There are, however, excluding the final change to the
adult, at least four moults during the whole period of growth.

An important feature to be observed is the gradual addition of joints to the
antenns, and the consequent increase in the length of the latter. This takes place
by means of successive divisions of the third joint, which, along with the newest
formed joints, constitutes a zone of imperfectly differentiated elements, where growth
is actively going on (Plate 5, fig. 26). It is further noteworthy that the number of
joints in the antennz increases without any apparent relationship to the number of
moults that take place.

When the larvie have attained a length of 4 mm., those which are destined to
