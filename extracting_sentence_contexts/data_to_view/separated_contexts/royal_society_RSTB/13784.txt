Thus, except for a few classic studies
listed above, most experiments on murine spatial orientation
use visual cues. As these experiments also demonstrate,
visual cues are important even in the presence of olfactory
cues. In fact, the two modalities may have clearly matched
complementary advantages and disadvantages [30], but at
the very least, our experiments should be designed in the expli-
cit knowledge of the natural statistics of the sensory cues in the
study speciesâ€™s environment. Fortunately, we are in the midst of a conceptual crisis that
threatens our complacency with the status quo, offering hope
that future species will be chosen based on scientific prin-
ciples [3,4]. The crisis comes from unexpected results that
question the hegemony of visual cues in the study of hippo-
campal function.
