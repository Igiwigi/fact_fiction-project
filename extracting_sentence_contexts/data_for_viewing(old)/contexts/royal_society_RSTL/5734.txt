8quare inch ; hence it appears that a considerable reduction of tenacity must be
for the riveting of the plates. The ratio of reduction is in this case $.

One remarkable fact distinetly established by these experiments, is the com:
weakness of tubes subjected to external pressure. If p be put for the internal
per 8quare inch at which a tube is ruptured, then for tubes of the same thickness
diameter, we find from (6.) and (7.) the following relation of strength :;—

If L=2Z and £=043, then =7:77; that is to say, in this case the tube subje
to internal pressure will have about 74 times the strength of a similar tube subj
external pressure. When
