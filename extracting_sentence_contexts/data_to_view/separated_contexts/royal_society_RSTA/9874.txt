Optical and specific gravity tests, especially the
extinctions of cleavage flakes, show that they range from labradorite to basic
bytownite (An 50 per cent. to An 84 per cent.). They are full of glass enclosures,
often of regular shape, with fixed bubbles. Zonal structure is very common in them ;
in fact, they present similar characters to those of the phenocrysts in the bombs, to
be described later. The commonest faces are 001, 010, 110, 110, 101, 201. The
augite is pale brownish-green, very slightly pleochroic in thick grains.
