Finally, from the 6th brain, 20 blocks were again cut, and of these 11 contained
both laminations, and 9 the visuo-psychic lamination only. The large number of
regions containing visuo-psychic lamination only is here due to the small development
of the area of special lamination. The greater number of the blocks were cut by the freezing method, which is
probably responsible for the fact that not a single error of orientation occurred
throughout the investigation. The sections were consequently cut, stained, mounted,
and drawn before their different appearances had been forgotten. After being cut,
the sections were prepared by the Nissl method, and by one or other of the modifica-
tions of the Weigert-Pal method, which I have described in previous papers (30).
