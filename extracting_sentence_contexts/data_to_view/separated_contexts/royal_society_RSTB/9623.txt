But that was not the case. The earliest rocks that
bore any recognizable animal fossils contained representatives
of several different phyla, including arthropods, molluscs, bra-
chiopods and echinodermsâ€”all of which were rather complex
and specialized. Although what nineteenth century geologists referred to as
the Cambrian era has since undergone considerable revision,
one important fact has not changed: rocks older than the
Cambrian contain very few bilaterian fossils [6,7]. Darwin was
famously aware of this seemingly sudden origin of diverse ani-
mals in the fossil record and considered it among the most
serious objections to his theory of natural selection [8]. He pro-
posed that imperfections of the fossil record were responsible
for the abrupt appearance of animal fossils, and that an extended
interval of animal evolution remained to be discovered.
