It may be here observed that the formulee (T.) and (IL) in section 26, and the
formulze(T.) and (I1.) in section 28, show that there exists an intimate symbolical connexion
between det (P, Q) and the product P,Q. In fact the only difference between their
symbolical properties consists in P and Q n0t being commutative in the expression
det (P, Q), and being s0 in the expression for the product. 30. There is one more proposition which is often very useful in analytical dynamics.
