When these three suspended larvee were transferred August 31, one pupa was also
found suspended from the food-plant: it was a light (3).

These results harmonise well with the more complete transference experiments in
Division B. The dark transferred pupa was only exposed in the larval state for the
last few hours of Stage IIT., and the resulting colour shows that it could not have
been influenced at all. It was evidently an exceptionally dark form for this series.
The others were exposed for probably the whole of Stage III. and were much affected,
one of them being brighter than any of the transferred pupz in Division B. The
latter result must be also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been previously
exposed to surroundings which were far less dark than those made use of in B.

D. Another experiment was made upon six mature larve, which were placed,
August 31, 2.30 P.M., in a small cylinder resembling those described in Series V., B.,
covered with two layers of black tissue-paper, but lined with gilt paper. The larvee
had the opportunity of being influenced by the gold, illuminated by daylight, for
a few seconds before the cylinder was placed on a black floor, with another double-
layered black cylinder over it, in a dark cupboard.

September 2, 7.30 p.m. The cylinder was not touched till this date, but I had
estimated that they would have pupated long before this time, and therefore the
cylinder was now removed, and it was found that all six had pupated on the roof and
