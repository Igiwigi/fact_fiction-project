Usually, the LSA is used to determine the linear
stability properties of a given numerical scheme for uniform base flows and assuming a periodic
simulation domain. To further include the impact of boundary conditions or grid mesh refinement
techniques, one must use more complicated methods [55,56]. In the CFD community, the LSA
is most commonly called a von Neumann (or Fourier) analysis owing to the fact that von
Neumann was among the first to study the linear stability of numerical schemes used to solve
partial differential equations [57]. Even if this analysis cannot quantify the impact of nonlinear
(de)stabilization mechanisms, it is a mandatory step to assess the good behaviour of a numerical
scheme in terms of both accuracy and robustness [57,58]. When it comes to the LBM community,

despite the tremendous number of numerical validations of collision models that have been : =
published up to now, only a few of them rely on the LSA [7-9,11,16,59-78].
