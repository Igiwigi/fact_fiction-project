Read July 1, 1818. My DEAR SIR,
Berkeley-square, June 20, 1813. I HAVE already described, in a letter which you were s0 good
as to communicate to the Royal Society, a few facts respecting
a new detonating compound. I shall now do myself the
honour of mentioning to you some other particulars on the
subject. I received, in April, a duplicate of the letter in which the
discovery was announced, containing an Appendix, in which
the method of preparing it was described.
