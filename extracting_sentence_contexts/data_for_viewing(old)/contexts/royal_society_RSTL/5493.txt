scopical examination. It was now important to determine, by actual experiment,
whether a purely vegetable diet would, according to my former method of investigation,
determine the presence of an excess of margaric acid in the precipitate obtained by mix-
ing the alcoholic extract of faeces with milk of lime. TI consequently submitted myself
to a vegetable diet, consisting of bread, potatoes, water-cresses, 8alad, other green vege-
tables, wine, beer and tea; vegetable soup was prepared for me without meat, gravy, or
butter; I avoided milk, eggs, &. Having confined myself exclusively to this vegetable
diet for four days, I examined the second evacuation passed since the beginning of the
experiment ; the lime precipitate in the clear alcohol extract was collected on a filter,
and dissolved in hydrochloric acid ; not only did the substance insoluble in hydrochloric
acid yield margaric acid, but it contained at least two or three times as much of this
substance as I had ever obtained by the method in question. I was prevented from con-
