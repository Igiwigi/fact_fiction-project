to take up more space along all cardinal axes, so processing
them requires spatially-distributed attention and establishes
numerical associations along the three spatial and one temporal
dimension. Everyone learns that ‘more is up’ [13] and people
raised in Western cultures learn that increasingly larger
number names are associated with increasingly more right-
sided actions [14,15], either due to brain asymmetry [16] or
from observational learning [17]. Similarly, our ability to dis-
tinguish perceptual numerosities is governed by Weber's law
(the just-noticeable difference between sets increases with set
size) and this performance signature is preserved with symbolic
quantities (i.e. discriminating two digits’ meanings [18]). More-
over, the physical fact that more objects tend to take up more
space leads to systematic everyday experiences. For example,
once a minimal, subitizable (immediately quantitatively
appreciable) set size is exceeded, we frequently use temporally
extended behaviours which correlate with numerosity, such as
counting. Counting constitutes verbal sensory-motor routines
to establish one-to-one correspondences between objects and
number names until each object (or group) has been referenced
once and the last number name establishes set size or cardinal-
ity [19]. Fingers are universal means of associating the spatial,
visual, kinesthetic and proprioceptive body signals with
number names [20-22]. Thus, whenever we interact with quan-
tities, systematically correlated multi-modal sensory-motor
