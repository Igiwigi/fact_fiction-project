A and B (fig. 1) are two metallic rods capable of adjustment by sliding along their
common axis, but having no freedom to move transversely ; in our earlier experiments
we made use of the head stock and back centre of a watchmaker’s lathe. Fig. 1

C is a coach spring attached to A, and carrying a point H, to which the end of the
quartz thread is fastened. B is a brass axle capable of turning about the axial line HI, which also represents
the quartz thread; it is attached rigidly to an arm carrying a vernier G, The
vernier moves over a divided circular are—a sextant being in fact employed. The quartz thread has as nearly as possible a diameter of °0015 inch = ‘0038
centim., and is very uniform; it is soldered up to the points prepared for it at H
and I,

The distance of A from B is regulated so that the thread is stretched tight by the
spring at C. The length HI is 30°5 centims.
