although its position was only roughly estimated.

Again, on September 20, Dr. CopELANp observed traces of a condensation of light
at wave-length 471°6, and this also was probably the blue carbon band of the nebula,
other lines being masked by the brighter continuous spectrum. On other occasions, not
even the faint blue band was seen, the spectrum being recorded as quite continuous.

As the brighter continuous spectrum due to the Nova gradually dimmed, the
bands of the nebula in the green became more prominent.

It is thus seen that although there does not appear to have been a regular
sequence of events in the spectrum of Nova Andromede, as far as the actual
observations go, it is probably due to difficulties of observation, and to the fact that
the spectrum of the Nova was superposed upon that of the nebula. Local atmos-
pherie conditions also had a marked effect upon the observations. Thus, the spectrum

was observed on September 11, by Copetann, SHERMAN, and Maunper; Copenanp
recorded a “ quite continuous ” spectrum, whilst SHERMAN and Maunper agreed only
with regard to one line.
