corresponding phases change from 2, to @_ (figure 3). A similar statement can be made for the
neighbourhood of I7(u), that is, if we cross the free boundary Ig(u)\Jy in the positive t-direction
then the phases will change from Q_ to Q,.

Thus, we have

P(u)=Ty(u) VU Pp(u) U Ty.

It should be noted that this IY is just the ‘pathological’ part of the free boundary mentioned
in the Introduction. Indeed, we have no information about the values of u on Iy, since I, is, in
general, not the level set {1 = a} as well as not the level set {1 = 8}. Furthermore, for any direction
e € R" functions (Deu)+ = max{Deu, 0} and (Deu)— = max{—Deut, 0} are, in general, not sub-caloric
near Iy. The latter fact causes serious difficulties in studying the regularity properties of solutions.

We will also distinguish the following parts of I’:
FEC) = Fa(u) {|u| =0) and Fy (u) = Fa(u)\Ty
The sets Te and I; are defined analogously. In addition, we set
Mu) :=TLWM URW) and P*(u):=NF(u) UT; (u).

Using the von Mises transformation combined with the parabolic theory and the implicit
function theorem, it is possible to show that I”*(1)\Iy is locally a Cl-surface.
