The next writer, VIAULT,* turned his attention principally to the mieroscopic
features of the brain of these animals ; he was almost the first to do 80 exclusively to
the Plagiostomata. In a general way he was preceded þby STrepa t in the Teleostei,
but the investigations of this writer in the Plagiostomata were confined to the spinal
cord only.

Levpis | had long previously conducted researches into the microscopic anatomy of
the Plagiostomata, but they were principally restricted to other organs of the body
and were very slightly turned to the brain, in which, however, he sncceeded in making
a noteworthy discovery.

Vriaurn's treatise, although very voluminous, contains no new facts, and the
illustrations leave much to be desired, being stiff and apparently semi-diagrammatie.
He did not neglect homology, and refuted Mixrmono-MAcray on one 8ide and
Ronox and FRITSCH, in advance, on the other; against the former he asserted the
claim of the cerebellum to that name, and also showed how the optic lobes could not,
be the cerebrum, but were homologous with the corpora bigemina (< tubercules
jumeaux ”), and therefore belonged to the mesencephalon, The hypoarium he
identified with the tuber cinereum.

This writer, then, has adopted the ordinary interpretation of the various segments
of the brain in these animals ; far otherwise is it with Romox, F It seems as if the
more recent German anatomists were unable to put pen to paper without trying to
suggest 8ome new and more or less untenable views. With regard to the cerebrum
