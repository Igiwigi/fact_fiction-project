Molecular basis of insect vision has been investigated mainly mRNA is located apart from them and relatively close to the

in insects; Gaq subunit activates PLC£, and depletion of PIP2 protein [54,55], the different mRNA distribution could suggest
caused by PLC leads to activation of TRP/TRPL channels more likely that Asop9 is located at rhabdomeres, but MosOpn3
and then to photoreceptor cell depolarizations [2,40]. That is not and rather at the cytoplasm or terminal of R7. The idea

was reasonable because the fruit fly only has Gq-coupled is intriguing because at Drosophila photoreceptor synapses,


histamine H3 receptors—which are Gi-coupled—receive a least in vitro [21,58]. Together with the fact that insect visual
