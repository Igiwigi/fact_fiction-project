SOLLAS AND MISS IGERNA B. J, SOLLAS ON AN

Amphibia is behind the eye, and this is the connection of the gammation with the
cranial walls in our youngest specimen, but in larger specimens, though apparently
freed from this connection, the gammation has not entered into union with the
auditory capsules ; it may have done so, but there is no absolute proof that it did. Still, our friend, Professor Brrpe@r, who has carefully studied our reconstructions,
remarks that “it looks as though such a connection must have existed” ;
in this we fully concur, and if we may assume that the appearance represents
the fact, we may identify, as we have done, the gammation with the hyo-
mandibular, the pre-gammation with the palato-quadrate, the posterior trapezial
with the hyoid, and the anterior trapezial bars with the mandible. The
lower jaw would, in this case, have been singularly diminutive ; it could have bitten
against the palato-quadrate, and its position would have been transverse. Its two
halves are now separated in the middle line, and it is unprovided with teeth.
