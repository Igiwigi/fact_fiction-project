The carboketonic ether thus indicated has actually been obtained by GEUTHER
according to the first of the above equations, and is described by him, in the paper
above alluded to, under the name Di-methylene-carbonic-acid-ethylene ether, In fact
he appears to have also obtained, in a free state, the acid of the above ether which is
formed when the latter is placed in contact with water, although he has not yet sub-
mitted it to investigation.
