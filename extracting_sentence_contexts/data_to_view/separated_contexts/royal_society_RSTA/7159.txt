These are assumed to split out with increasing chain length
from the known frequencies of the first member of each set as determined from the detailed
assignments of the spectra of propane (CH, modes) and ethane (C—C stretching). It is
generally agreed that the CH, twisting and rocking fundamentals in propane have the
frequencies 1278 and 748 cm~! respectively (Rasmussen 1948; McMurry & Thornton
1951) and the C—C stretching mode in ethane gives rise to a Raman line at 993 cm7!
(Bhagavantam 1931-2). The assignment of the B, CH, wagging mode in propane is com-
plicated by the fact that it is to some extent coupled with other vibrations of the same
