This variation, though quite appreciable when we are dealing with large ranges, is
hardly worth considering in the case of the minimum ranges in Table XLVI.

Examining that table we see that the winter months, especially December, are
conspicuous for small ranges. The fact that the mean values of R’ for winter months
fall conspicuously short of those for other seasons is due, not so much to the absence
of large values of R’,as to the presence of a considerable number of very small values.
In summer, really small ranges are scarce. In fact, in the half year from April to
September no single day of the 11 years had a range under 5’. In 1893 no April
day had a range under 12”5, though the mean value for the month was only 171,
and in June the lowest range was 12’3 though the mean for the month was only
164, The uniformity of the range in June 1893 was very remarkable. In 21 of the
30 days the range lay between 14”0 and 185 and the highest value of the month
was only 21’6. The absolutely smallest range of the 11 years was 2”2, or 12y in
force.

Turning to Table XLVIL., we see that the lowest range recorded was 7y. The
