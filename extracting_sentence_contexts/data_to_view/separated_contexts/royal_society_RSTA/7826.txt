The upper
state differences, R(J) — P (J), have not been tabulated. The usual expression for the rotation terms is of the form F (J) = BJ (JJ +1)+
DJ? (J + 1)2, with higher terms in J if required. In this case they are not, and, in fact,
D is so small that it was found impossible to determine it satisfactorily from the
differences themselves. They are given by

FU +1)—-FG —1) = +2) (B+ 2D(+I+0)
A preliminary value of B was first obtained by dividing each difference by (43 + 2). Since D is very small, these quotients tend to a constant value (2.e., B) as J decreases.
