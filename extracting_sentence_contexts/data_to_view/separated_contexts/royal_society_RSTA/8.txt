It is observed that, if the density of the extensive property is given by
an n-form 6 which does not vanish where w does not vanish, there is a unique vector field w
satisfying the condition # = w. 6. Evidently, the vector field w may be interpreted as a velocity
field and its integral lines may be interpreted as body points. In fact, even if no specific volume
element 6 is given, the flux form w determines a family of one-dimensional submanifolds which
one may interpret as body points [16]. Rather than restricting ourselves to sections of A" TY, as suggested by the discussion
above, we consider for now a general vector bundle z : W â€” .Y. In accordance with the Eulerian
point of view, we model a force functional F as a continuous, linear functional on the space ch)
of differentiable sections of W having compact supports.
