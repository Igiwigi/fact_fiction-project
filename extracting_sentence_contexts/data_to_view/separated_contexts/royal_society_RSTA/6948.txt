Before going on to discuss this important aspect we shall
make brief comments on an iterative method, for use with Volterra’s equation, analogous
to that described in § 6 and employed on Fredholm’s equation.

18. A CLASSICAL ITERATIVE METHOD

For the solution of the integral equation (56) Friedlander used an iterative method, given
by the relations

He evaluated f(x) analytically, and computed f, f® and f by numerical integration,
taking f(x) as an acceptable solution of the integral equation. In fact, his errors in the
