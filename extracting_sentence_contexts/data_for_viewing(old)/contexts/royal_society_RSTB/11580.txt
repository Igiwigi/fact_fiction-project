At the moment, bioprinting is rapidly reaching a point
where its main hurdles for translational are in the need for
intrinsic vasculature in large bioprinted structures, and the
controlled differentiation of stem cells in situ in 3D. Vascula-
ture is necessary to support nutrient and gas exchange in
larger engineered structures to prevent the formation of
necrotic areas. The step from 2D to 3D cell culture also
requires new optimisation and developments in the protocols
required to control cell fate decisions for controlled differen-
tiation. If both can be tackled, production of allogenic and
autologous tissue replacement willl move from the realm of
science fiction to reality. If both can be tackled, production
