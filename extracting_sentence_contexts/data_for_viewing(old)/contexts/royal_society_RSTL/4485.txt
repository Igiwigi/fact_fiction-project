be found, he believes, to afford a precision to Physiological doctrines which they have
never before possessed ; and to open out, a vast number of new lines of inquiry, which
promise an ample harvest of results, not only valuable in a scientific view, but likely
to be fertile in applications to various departments of the therapentic art. At any
rate, it is very important that Physiological science should be considered under the
same dynamic aspect, as that under which the Physical sciences are now viewed by
the most enlightened philosophers ; and he trusts that the present attempt may thus
