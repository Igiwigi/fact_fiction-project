From Mr. ST. Fox 0's account, it does not appear
that the vegetable leaves contained in the schistus of Roche-Seauve have been chemically

fact ; but, if it were unsupported by any other, the only inference
would be, that the schistus was most probably of very recent
formation, and had been produced under peculiar circumstances. I was desirous, therefore, to discover some similar cases, which
might serve as additional corroborative proofs of the gradual
alterations by which vegetable bodies become changed, s0 as at
length to be regarded as forming part of the mineral kingdom;
and, from the reasons which have been stated in the commence-
ment of this Paper, as well as from-a certain similarity in the
external characters of the substance composing the leaves above-
mentioned with those of the Bovey coal, I was induced to make
this last also a subject of chemical inquiry. In the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1760,* some
remarks on the Bovey coal, and an account of the strata, are
Stated, in a letter from the Rev.
