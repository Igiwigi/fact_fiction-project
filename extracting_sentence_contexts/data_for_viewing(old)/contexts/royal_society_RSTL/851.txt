come covered, (for, properly speaking, they never can be said
to heal,) affords further proof, were it wanted, that the medul-
lary processes, (as they are improperly named, ) like every other
part of the wood, are generated by the bark.

Whenever the surface of the alburnum is exposed but for a
few hours to the air, though no portion of it be destroyed,
vegetation on that surface for ever ceases. But new bark is
gradually protruded from the sides of the wound, and by this
new wood is generated. In this wood, the medullary processes
are distinctly seen to take their origin from the bark, and to *
terminate on the lifeless surface of the old wood within the
wound. These facts incontestibly prove, that the medullary
processes, which in my former Paper I call the silver grain, do
not diverge from the medulla, but that they are formed in lines
converging from the bark to the medulla, and that they have no
connection whatever with the latter substance. And surely no-
thing but the fascinating love of a favourite system, could have
induced any naturalist to believe the hardest, the most solid, and
most durable part of the wood, to be composed of the soft,
cellular, and perishable substance of the medulla.

In my last Paper, I have supposed that the sap acquired the
power to generate wood in the leaf; and I have 8ubsequently
found no reason to retract that opinion. But the experiment in
