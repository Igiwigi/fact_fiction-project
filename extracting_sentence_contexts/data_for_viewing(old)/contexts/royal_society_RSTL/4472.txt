tion, though there can be no doubt that the force may be exerted in many cases in which cell-deyelopment
does not take place, The use which he would make of the term is just that which is commonly made of the
term © Engine-power;” every one knowing that the steam-engine possesses no power itself, but that it is
simply the instrument most commonly employed, because the most convenient and adyantageous yet devised,
for the application of the expansive force of steam, generated by the application of heat, to the production of
mechanical motion.

This inference derives a remarkable confirmation from a series of facts, which indi-
cate that when that specialization of function takes place, which has been mentioned
as a characteristic, of the higher organisms, the cells which become the instraments
of s0me one particular kind of operation seem to lose their other endowments,—as if
the expenditure of the vital force of each cell upon any one purpose, unfitted it, for
any other agency. 'Fhus the assimilating cells (whether floating in the nutrient fluids,
or included in the absorbent glandula), whose function it is to convert the raw material
supplied by the food into organizable plasma, exercise little or no purely chemical trans-
formation ; they do not undergo change of form; they do not exert any mechanical
or neryous power; and they do not reproduce their kind. So, again, the cells which
are specially endowed with the power of multiplication, seem to possess no other spe-
cial vital endowment ; simply receiving the nutriment which has been prepared for
them by other agencies, and applying it to the production of new cells, which, if
