This ‘minimization principle’ is set out for uses of personal data within the Data Protection Act. There are steps that we can take to do this, e.g. de-identifying or aggregating data to higher
levels, keeping data in registers and querying against them (rather than seeing the whole dataset),
or using synthetic data. We need to be alert to the fact that increasing the amount of data available
increases the possibility of de-identified data being re-identifiable. Often government will need to use identifiable data (and sometimes sensitive identifiable
data), or include large datasets to create good algorithmic models or identify wrongdoers. In
our research, participants were concerned about how this seemed to be in conflict with the
principle of innocent until proven guilty and using data from people who have done nothing
wrong to identify those who have.
