of the curves obtained by myself and those obtained by Curre and Danne at once
discloses some marked differences.

The lowest curve for a short exposure of 20 seconds is very similar in shape to the
corresponding curve, fig. 4, curve B, where the activity was measured by the « rays.
On the other hand, the upper curve A of fig. 7 does not show the initial drop found
by me (see fig. 4, curve A), where the activity is measured by the « rays. If the
activity is supposed to be measured by the # rays, the upper curve A, fig. 7, is
similar to that shown in fig. 6. The lower curve of fig. 7 is, however, again different
from the corresponding B-ray curve shown in fig. 5.

I think the difference between the results of Curre and DANNE and those obtained
by myself lies in the fact that the former did not take into account that the shape of
the curves depended on whether the « or 8 rays were used as a means of measure-
ment. Curt and Dane do not state, or give any evidence to show, which of the types
of rays they employed for measurement, but I think there is no doubt that the lower

curve (fig. 1) was obtained by means of the « rays, while the four upper curves (fig. 7)
were obtained by means of the 8 rays. The intermediate curves, for an exposure of
1 minute and 5 minutes, do not agree with the results obtained by me for either the
