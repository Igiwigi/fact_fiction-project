This is no longer true if the measurements we are
considering are unsharp. The discussion of unsharp measurement is necessary for the connection
of KS-type contradictions with experimental tests. In fact, due to practical limitations and
unavoidable experimental imperfections any actual implementation of a quantum measurement
will correspond to an unsharp measurement. In the next section, we will discuss how to connect the above notions to experimental
procedures involved in tests of quantum contextuality, by providing an operational interpretation
of them, and what are the corresponding physical assumptions.

3. Experimental tests of the Kochenâ€”Specker-type contradictions

In the above formulation of the KS theorem, we used terms such as projector, orthogonal vector,
commuting operators and so on.
