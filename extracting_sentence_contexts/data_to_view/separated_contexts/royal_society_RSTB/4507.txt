There were, however,
several facts which spoke against the theory of such uninterrupted production, as, for
instance, the periodicity in the occurrence and metamorphosis of the larvee which I
had discovered on board the ‘‘ Thor” in 1905-06. The net result, then, of our investigations by the close of 1912 was that a great
deal more research work would be needed, since the new data obtained had practically
raised. new difficulties in the way of an interpretation—as, indeed, often happens when
an investigation has passed beyond the earliest stages, when the paucity of facts
gives freer play to the imagination. The year 1913 was marked by important progress. Not only did our fishing cargo
vessels send us in richer material, but we succeeded in getting the little schooner
“Margrethe,” belonging to the Vendsyssel Packing Co., of Copenhagen, equipped
and sent out on a cruising expedition over the Atlantic, with a supply of nets, etc.,
for pelagic work.
