They are also the limits.
of researcherâ€™s imagination, which determines value and would like to embrace the world trying
to perceive (perhaps we cannot do nothing more than trying) its ultimate essence. For these
reasons, I find unfruitful polemic positions about the presumed excessive use of mathematics
in mechanics. It is not so much a matter of showing to the community the personal ability of
managing articulated mathematical structures as the basic fact that when we use some tools
we are able to tell something with a certain deepness and when we change tool we are telling
something else, perhaps less comprehensive for being less general (this is the reason, e.g., pushing
me to choose above to work with abstract differentiable manifolds instead of considering more
simply M as a linear space ...but this is just a trivial example). The question is to decide
about what we want to tell, not a priori about the mathematical tool we want to use. Formal
simplicity must be preferred to a more involved structure only when we reach the same level
of descriptive richness with respect to potential events in a specific class.
