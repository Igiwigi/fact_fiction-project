* his fact is confirmed by the experiments of Kunpt and Warburc (see ‘ Pogg. Ann.,’ vol. 156, p. 179,
1875). They found that, in a certain apparatus, the heat dissipated was independent of pressure up to
30 millims. in the case of air, and up to 154 millims in the case of hydrogen.

+ This relation between the heat lost by convection and the density, viscosity, and specific heat of a gas
only holds good when the speed of the convection currents is very low; at higher temperature and
pressures the phenomenon is more complex.
