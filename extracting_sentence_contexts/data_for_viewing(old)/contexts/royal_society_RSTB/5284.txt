Naruorst} substituted the generic name Pseudocycas for Cycas as the result of an
investigation of the epidermal structure. More recently Miss Houprn{ dealt with the
epidermal characters of different species of Pseudocycas, and Prof. Hattr§ made further
additions to our knowledge of the genus. The important point is that the fronds of
Pseudocycas differ in important respects from those of Cycas.

The best specimen obtained in 1921 is reproduced in fig, 67 ; it is a partially carbonised
impression 14 cm. long, bearing gradually tapering alternate pinne, some of which
exceed 7 cm. in length and are 2 to 3 mm. broad. The pinne are attached by a slightly
expanded base to the upper face of the rachis. A clearly defined ridge occupies the
middle line of some of the pinnz where the carbonised film has been removed. The
apices of the pinnze, seen in other specimens, are acutely pointed. Cuticular membranes
did not add any facts to those published by Naruorst. The specimen shown in fig. 64
is probably a piece of a young frond in which the pinne are contiguous and more or less
imbricate.
