With regard to the
observations in the meridian, that is, with the needle pointing
north or south, they could not be much affected by changes
in the temperature of the magnets, especially by such small
changes as I am persuaded alone took place : the extent of

the deviations may, in some instances, have been slightly in-

creased or diminished, but their directions could not be
changed. I have before mentioned that both Mr. BarLow and myself
found some anomalies between the observations in-doors and
those at the same points in the open air. When the times of
the maxima $hall have been determined independent of the
temperature of the magnets, I expect it will be found that
these anomalies have arisen from the difference in the changes
of temperature in the magnets when in-doors and when in
the open air: of this I only feel that degree of doubt, which
Should always be entertained until a fact is established. If such observations as I have given were continued for a
length of time, particularly those near the east and west, I
certainly expect that they would lead to important conclu-
sions respecting the causes of the diurnal variation, and I
regret that, as I have not the time to devote to them myself,
I must leave them to be made by others possessed of more
leisure. Should they be undertaken, the necessity of ascer-
taining in the first instance, the effects which changes of
temperature haye on the forces of the magnets employed,
and of observing the temperature of the magnets themselves

when the directions of the needle are taken, is here clearly
pointed out.
