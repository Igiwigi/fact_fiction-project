It is to be remembered, however,
that there is no evidence that either the involuntary muscular fibre or the pigmentary
tiszue is directly influenced by the cessation of the flow of blood, the effect being appa-
rently produced through the medium of the local nervous system. This we know with
certainty in the cage of the post mortem movements of the intestines; and we haye seen
reason to think it likely that the same is true regarding the contractions of the arteries
after death, and the concentration of the pigment under similar cireumstances. It is
curious question how the arrest of the circulation causes these actions of the local nerves,
The idea suggested by the facts is that the tissues begin to suffer from the want of fresh
supplies of the vital fluid, and resent the injury, as it were, by a struggle. Rich in results of general physiological interest as the study of the pigmentary system
of the frog has proved, it has yielded fruit of not less value in a pathological point of
view. Indeed, what induced me to investigate the functions of concentration and diffus
sion, was the unexpected light thrown upon the nature of inflammation by the effects
produced by irritants upon those processes.
