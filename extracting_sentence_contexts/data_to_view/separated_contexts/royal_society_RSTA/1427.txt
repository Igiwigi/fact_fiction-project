The
notion of what is affordable raises the question of how much society values accurate forecasts
of climate and whether climate simulation and prediction is of such importance societally that
it should be funded at a similar level of ambition to something like the Large Hadron Collider
[4]. We do not answer such questions here, but nevertheless suggest that the development of
algorithms which run in a reasonable time (say a day of wall-clock time for a decade of simulated
climate) on a dedicated exascale high-performance computer would appear a plausible objective
for the design of algorithms for the next-generation climate simulation and prediction models. Since it is believed that the underpinning equations of motion on which the algorithms are
based are correct, an inability to solve these equations numerically without significant bias
must arise from the fact that existing numerical representations are not sufficiently accurate. In
practice, this means that the resolution of existing models is inadequate. As such, it should be
possible to reduce these errors by increasing the resolution of the model sufficiently, thereby
eliminating some of the semi-empirical subgrid parametrizations [5], which are required to
represent processes, which are not resolvable on the chosen grid.
