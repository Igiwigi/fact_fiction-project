Hyorr suggested
that it is too highly differentiated to do otherwise All other tissues may arise from
either epicardial cells, mesenchyme cells, or atrial epithelial cells, although there is
survival of any part of the digestive tube that may be present, and, according
to Brien (1927), the cerebral ganglion and neural gland develop from the
dorsal cord if any part of that tissue is present. Accordingly, it appears that
non-differentiated or slightly differentiated tissues are capable of rapid proliferation
and of differentiation into any kind of tissue, that moderately differentiated tissue like
epidermis can proliferate, but only to form more tissue of the same kind (or with
dorsal cord tissue* to form more highly differentiated tissue but of a related type
such as ganglion and neural gland), and that highly differentiated tissue, such as that
of the digestive tube, is unable even to proliferate, at least with the rapidity necessary
in regeneration. These facts tend to show that the capacity for cell-division is
inversely proportional to the degree of differentiation, while plasticity, or totipotency
is to be correlated with the absence of previous differentiation. Such conclusions
are supported by the facts of regeneration in other phyla, though it is not proposed
to review here the extensive literature of this subject. Before discussing the significance of certain aspects of budding and regeneration
in ascidians, it is considered advisable to examine the method of budding in the
Thaliacea and its possible connection with any of the types found among the
ascidians proper.
