36. Another simple example, leading to well-known results, is afforded by the use
of @,,, As the modulus of a'*+q'* for w negative is (a—w)', the combination of

a power of @,, with a Schwarzian factor consisting of a suitable power of w—a will
give a free stream-line. Tn fact, the transformation

_ (awh)? dw ,

gives a liquid flow of the character indicated in fig. 12, there being a fixed obstacle
consisting of two planes meeting at an angle 2p7, and stream-lines extending to
infinity and tending to parallelism with the undisturbed stream.
