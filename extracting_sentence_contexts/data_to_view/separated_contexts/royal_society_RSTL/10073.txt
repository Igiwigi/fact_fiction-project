This explanation is not without its difficulties, The thickness of the © beginning of
the black,” when the proper correction for the refractive index is made, is, according
to NewroN's tables, 36 Xx 10-* millims., whereas one of our experiments (if we adopt
the above hypothesis) shows the average thickness of the thickest black parts of the
tilm to be (53:8+12) x 10-%=65:8 x 10-5 millims. This discrepancy may, perhaps, be explained by the fact we have already referred
to (Phil. Trans., 1881, p. 453) that measures on the diameters of NEwToN's rings are
of little value near the central black patch. :

It is, however, difficult to understand why all the films in one tube should behave J
80 differently from those in the other, while, if it be assumed that the difference is cansed
by a few tilms only, it hecomes necessary to extend the limits of the black through an
