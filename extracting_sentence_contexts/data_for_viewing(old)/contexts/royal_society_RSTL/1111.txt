f'=8+ 2. (9

This js in fact an equation of differences between the con-
secutive values of f, and the general value may therefore be
obtained by integration, or its particular ones deduced in suc-
cession from each other, when the integration is impractica-
ble from the values assigned to m, @, and ?. The greatest
simplification it appears to admit, is its reduction to an equa-
tion of the 2d order and first degree, which may be performed
by assuming p
