Qeaf-stalks, and room is thereby left for the encroachments of the grasses or other
plants which may be in the neighbourhood. In plants like Conopodium denudatum,
he leaf in its initial stage is packed into very small compass, almost like a furled flag.
n this state it is thrust up amid other leaves till it gets space to unfold. In other
=ases, as in the clovers, the two halves of the young leaves are folded like a sheet of
Dote-paper and remain s0 till by the lengthening of the stalks they grow beyond
Fhe obstruetion. In the Festuca ovind the thin, slender, cylindrical leaves easily make
Sheir way amongst the surrounding foliage, and this may be one reason for the pre-
-lominance of the plant, while its comparatively small evaporating surface may also
Stand it in good stead, In fine, there are endless adaptations snch as those cited,
ell known to the botanist, and familiar to the most superficial observer of plants.
-2[t is not needful to dwell upon them here ab any greater length, our object being
Fnot to call attention to special arrangements, but to the general fact that all these
Spariations, in the growth and * habit ” of plants, are elements to be considered in
Studying the nature and the force of the struggle for existence among them, and the
Zijrcumstances that determine the *snrvival of the fittest.”
EZ With reference to the minute anatomical struoture of the leaves and herbaceous
Spurts of plants, it is well known that external conditions have no inconsiderable
Zinfluence upon them. The structure of aquatic plants is a case in point ; the anatomi-
Jeal construction being profoundly modified as a consequence of the medium in which
Sthe plants grow. So, also, the increased sncculence—due to augmented size or number
=of cells—seen in plants grown by the sea-side is matter of common observation. The
Rdensely woody contracted habit of shrubby plants growing on the higher mountains has
also often been noted. Amongst the most recent investigations on this subject are those
of M. Duyar Jouve, who has examined the structure of the leaves of grasses as modified
