formulation, were it not for the fact that the Lorentz force exerted by such fields can be rendered
weak through alignment of the magnetic induction and the current density. Such force-free
fields were thus postulated to exist many years ago, although their origin remained somewhat
mysterious. This led Woltjer [3] (see also [4]) to realize that magnetic helicity Hjy (definitions and
equations are given in §2) was an invariant of the MHD equations in the absence of forcing and
of dissipation, as was the cross helicity (or cross-correlation Hc) between the magnetic field and
the velocity.

It was only some years later that a similar conservation law was unraveled in the fluid case : =
for the kinetic helicity Hy [5-7]. Helicity corresponds to topological properties of the flows and : =
fields, through knots, links, twists and writhes [6,8,9], and their entanglement. Helicity is a pseudo :3
(axial) scalar, since it can change sign upon change of a reference frame from right-handed to left- : =
handed. This corresponds to the (similar) fact that, in a Serret—Frenet frame describing a string in 2k
three-dimensional space, the torsion is pseudo scalar, the line being able to exit the plane formed [3
by the tangent and curvature to the string, upward or downward. :s

Helicity appears to play a role in disparate areas of research beyond fluid dynamics and :8
plasmas, from DNA and bio-chemistry to meta-materials [10]. It is also involved in the problem of : Ss
entanglements of vortex lines in quantum fluids [11]. Yet another instance is the orientation of the 7k

swimming motions of simple biological systems, with possible applications to nanotechnology:
chiral behaviour basically allows for more complex three-dimensional motions and thus to follow
physical gradients, e.g. of nutrients. Even in an ocean strongly stratified at large scale, at the size
of these microorganisms (of the order of 10 1m), the flow itself indeed is three-dimensional [12].
