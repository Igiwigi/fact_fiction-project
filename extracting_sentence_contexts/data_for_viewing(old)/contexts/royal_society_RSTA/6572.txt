suspending fibre. Lastly, air-currents cannot explain the remarkable uniformity of
direction in which the rotation always takes place, nor its inversion in the case of the
hemicylindrical screen.

“Tt is seen that the direction of rotation is closely connected with the position of

the observer ; this seems to indicate that the origin of this force is in the observer
himself. If so, what is its nature ?”

Rough preliminary experiments having enabled me to verify the broad facts of
rotation as described by M. Tors, I fitted up a more accurate apparatus (fig. 3),
consisting of a glass case, ABCDEF, six-and-a-half inches square and seven .inches
high, with a rising glass window, ABGH, in front, and similar windows at the sides.
The top is of card, in the centre of which isa small hole. The cylinder, I, is suspended

_ in the middle of the case by a very fine cocoon silk fibre, 5 feet long, surrounded by a
card tube, J, attached to the top of the glass box. K is a second cylinder attached to
a support, LM, by a ball-and-socket joint for convenience of adjustment. The support,
M, projects outside the case to admit of the second cylinder (which I shall call the
pillar) being brought close to the suspended cylinder (which, for distinction, I shall call
