A piece of platinized platinum foil was supported in an exhausted receiver, the vessel
being 80 placed that the focus fell upon the platinum. The heat of the focus was
instantly converted into light, a clearly defined and inverted image of the points being
stamped upon the metal. Fig. 5 (Plate I.) represents the thermograph of the carbons.

Blackened paper was now substituted for the platinum in the exhausted receiver.
Placed at the focus of invisible rays, the paper was instantly pierced, a cloud of smoke
was poured through the opening, and fell like a cascade to the bottom of the receiver.
The paper seemed to burn without incandescence. Here also a thermograph of the coal
points was stamped out. When black paper is placed at the focus, where the thermal
image is well defined, it is always pierced in two points, answering to the images of the
two carbons. The superior heat of the positive carbon. is shown by the fact that its
image first pierces the paper; it burns out a large space, and shoys its peculiarly crater-
like top, while the negative carbon usually pierces a small hole.

Paper reddened by the iodide of mercury had its colour discharged at the places on
which the invisible image of the coal points fell upon it.

Disks of paper reduced to carbon by different processes were raised to brilliant incan-
descence, both in the air and in the exhausted receiver.
