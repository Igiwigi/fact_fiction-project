Z This mode of viewing their constitution is in perfect harmony with the facts at pre-
E 8ent in our possession, both as regards the deportment of the substitution-anilines,
6 and the substances similarly derived from hydrated oxide of phenyl. Experiment
S has shown that in aniline 1, 2 or 3 equivalents of hydrogen may be replaced by
5 chlorine, bromine, and probably also by the elements of hyponitric acid *. In these
Q 8ubstances their basic properties gradually diminish with the successive insertions
* At the present moment we have only nitraniline, but it is scarcely to be doubted that we shall soon be-
come acquainted with the nitro-term corresponding to dichloraniline and trichloraniline. Recent researches
of M. Canovss (Ann. Ch. Phys, s&r. xxvii. 439) on the derivatives of anisole haye pointed out the first alka-
loid containing 2 equiys, of hyponitric acid.
