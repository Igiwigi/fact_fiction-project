EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF THE STREAM-LINES FOR AN INnviscrip FLurp. 20. The apparatus employed for the experimental determination of the stream-
lines for the perfect fluid was that designed by Mr. E. F. Renr.f It depends upon the
fact that the equations giving the stream-lines in a non-viscous fluid and the equipo-
tential lines in an electric field are identical. The apparatus consists of a concrete tank
5 ft. long, 2 ft. 6 in.
