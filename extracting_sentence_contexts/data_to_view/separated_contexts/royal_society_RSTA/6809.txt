The equation can be solved in terms of four power series of the type

P,(w) = w?! > (pi —P2)! (Pi=Ps)! (Ai ps)! ur (8-2)
: =, (p;—Po+n)! (pfs +n)! (f1—pa tn)! a!”
nao (Py —f2+n)! (bi —Ps3 +m): (Pi Ps nats
This sum is a generalized hypergeometric function, and written in standard notation the
solution is cra p
P,(w) = w?! oF 3(p,—Po+1, bibs +1, Pi Pa +1 w)s

together with three similar solutions. |
To investigate the relation between the solutions, (8:1) may also be solved in terms of
Barnes’s integrals. Consider, for example, the Barnes integral

1,(u) = 5 l. (s4-p,—1)! (64+-p_—1)! (s+ Pp—1)! (8-+h4— 1)! 0-8 ds

where C,, is one of the paths of figure | starting and finishing at infinity in the negative half-
plane. It can easily be shown that /(w) satisfies the differential equation (8-1); this will,
in fact, be shown by (8-4). The poles of the integrand are at the points
