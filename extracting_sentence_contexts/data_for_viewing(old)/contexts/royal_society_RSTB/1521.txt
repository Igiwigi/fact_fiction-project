and by Morr and Suerrinetont in monkeys, for these observers found that impairment
of movement in a limb resulted on section of the sensory roots of the spinal nerves
supplying the limb,

If the interruption of afferent impulses in their passage through the sensory nerve
roots is capable of producing impairment of movement, there is no reason why the
interruption of similar afferent impulses passing up the lateral region by the medulla
and in the inferior cerebellar peduncle should not be also capable of bringing about a
similar result. ;

That this is probably the correct explanation of the way in which defective move-
ment is brought about by division of one inferior peduncle or by lateral section of the
medulla is suggested by the fact that the degree of sensory and motor impairment in
the limbs is very much alike, that is, the limb in which motor power is most defective

after these lesions is that in which most sensory impairment was met with, while
that in which there was least sensory impairment was that in which there was least
defect of movement. It is further significant, in this connection, that improvement
