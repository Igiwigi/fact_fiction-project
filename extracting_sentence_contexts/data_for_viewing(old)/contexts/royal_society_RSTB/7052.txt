MITOTIC ACTIVITY IN THE ADULT FEMALE MOUSE 507

Swingle 1940; Schopfer 1943), produce wound hormones one of whose functions is the
stimulation of abnormally active cell division. The precise nature of these hormones is
not yet understood. Possibly they are breakdown products of protein formed in the dead
cells lining the wound, but there is evidence, for instance, from the study of the production
of growth-promoting substances in yeast injured by ultra-violet radiation (see review by
Needham 1942), that they may be produced as a physiological response to injury rather
than as cell disintegration products. The extremely local areas which these substances are
able to influence, and the fact that they are apparently not distributed to the body via the
blood stream, suggests either that they are unstable or that some mechanism exists for
their rapid destruction. Whatever their method of formation and destruction, and whatever
their chemical structure, the effect of these wound hormones appears definite. Diffusing
into the tissues immediately adjacent to the wound, they greatly increase the rate of mitosis
by the elimination of the two forces of cell inertia and mitosis depression. This elimination
appears to be almost, if not entirely, complete, and it takes place in all the types of cells
examined except the peculiarly inert leucocytes. As a consequence, cell division is observed
to occur simultaneously and at an abnormally high rate in tissues of such diverse character
as the epidermis, the sebaceous gland, the dermal and hypodermal connective tissue, and
even striped muscle, and to continue in these tissues for as long as the wound hormone is
secreted. For the duration of the healing process, the tissues upon which these hormones
act are similar in their method of growth to the proliferating centres of the intestinal lymph
