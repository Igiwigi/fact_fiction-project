The mineral often presents itself in little spherules, invariably green in their tint and
crystalline in their structure, as revealed by their optical characters, and sometimes, but
very rarely, carrying here and there a crystal face. In fact the faces thus presenting
themselves seem to do 80 almost fortuitously, and on the grains, which present a nearer ,
approach to a true crystalline superficies, the faces that are developed exhibit very little
of the symmetrical correspondence with other faces, or of the prevalence of those of any
special forms, such as is ordinarily met with in crystals.

The specific gravity of this mineral is 3-238, that of the silicates in the Steinbach |
siderolite, as determined by STROMEYER, having been 3-276, and as estimated by RUMLER
3-23. 'The hardness is 6.
