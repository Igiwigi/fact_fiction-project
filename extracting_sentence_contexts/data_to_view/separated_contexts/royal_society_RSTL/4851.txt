THE communication which I have now the honour to present to the Royal Society

is a portion of a series of investigations on the Development of the Embryo on which
< TI have been for some years engaged, and which was commenced in a paper on the
S Development of the Myriapoda, that was honoured with a place in the Philosophical
2 'Transactions for 1841. TI now propose to give the results of my observations on the
= Amphibia, reserving to a future early occasion the continuation of those on the Inver-
S tebrata commenced in the paper alluded to. S The Amphibia, of all the vertebrated animals, afford to us the readiest means of
= investigating the difficult subject of Impregnation by actual experiment, and it is
2 only, perhaps, by combining experiment with careful observations on the physical
Z conditions that affect the development of the germ, and comparing these with the
£ facts of the natural history and instincts of the species, that we may hope, ulti-
Ss mately, to obtain some further insight into this one of Nature's most hidden secrets.
'S I sball endeavour, therefore, in this communication, to show the condition of the
= ovyum in the Amphibia through its earliest changes, and also before and immediately
& after impregnation, and to detail experiments made with a view to learn by what
means its fecundation is effected ;—and in a future communication I propose to trace
ZE the development of the embryo from the time of fecundation to that of its liberation
g from the ovyum, in the two chief divisions of the class,—the tailless and the tailed
£ Amphibia., The subjects thus naturally form two series—Impregnation and De-

© velopment.
= IMPREGNATION OF THE OVUM.
5 The history of what we can now prove to be the agent of impregnation, the sper-

A matozoon, deserves to be especially noticed. Although great attention has been paid
by physiologists during the last thirty years to almost every point of inquiry connected
with the production and physical composition of the seminal fluid of animals, and its
relation to the fecundation of the ovum, we have remained to the present time without
any acknowledged proof either of the part which the different constituents of this
fluid take in impregnation, or of the mode in which it effects impregnation. This
perhaps is little to be wondered at when we remember how many years elapsed before
the great discovery of Ham and Lezwexnork of the existence of moving bodies in
the fluid, as part of its normal composition, was admitted.
