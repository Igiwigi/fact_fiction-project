were disengaged from it, indicating the presence of phos-
phorous acid. The experiment was repeated two or three
times, care being taken to separate the red powder which
has been considered as an oxide of phosphorus, and always
with the same result.

Whenever phosphorus is inflamed, and suffered to become
extinguished in oxygen gas in excess, unless the product is
strongly heated after the spontaneous combustion is over, an
acid, of which the hydrate produces phosphuretted hydrogen
by heat, is always found in the products; and this acid is
probably produced by the action of the solid phosphorus on
the phosphoric acid in contact with it. This fact, and the
circumstance, that much phosphorus acid is produced by the
combustion of phosphorus in rare air, renders it almost cer-
tain that the phosphorous acid is a direct combination of
phosphorus and oxygen, and..destroys an idea which might
otherwise be formed from the phenomena of the decompo-
sition of \its hydrate, namely, that'it is a compound of three
proportions of phosphoric acid, and one of phosphuretted
hydrogen.

M. DuLons and M. BERzELIvs speak of freeing phospho-
rane, or the liquid chloride of phosphorus, from phosphorus,
