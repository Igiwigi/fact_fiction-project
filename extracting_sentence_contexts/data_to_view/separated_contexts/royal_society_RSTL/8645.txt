or is it perhaps an invagination
to give rise to a block of tisxwe connected subsequently with the rectum and anus ? That question occurred to me; and if the former supposition could not be supported,
the apparent analogy with the shell-groove of Pisidium would be a false one ; also
the possibility that this primitive groove in Mollusca generally may represent the
closed epidermal sac, in which the pen of Loligo is developed, would haye no basis. I am able definitely and conclusiyely to show that the © shell-groove ” in Aptysia does
really belong to the shell, and in fact sometimes contains a plug of chitinous secretion,
an imbedded hell in fact, the possible homogen of the internal pen of Cephalopoda. The specimens which gaye this interesting result, and which also throw light on the
connexion of the rectal portion of the alimentary canal with the early aboral thick-
ening of the epiblast and the cell marked pme, are artificially produced deformities. I was in the habit of keeping egg-coils of Aplysia minor in a basin, through which
there ran a constant current of sea-water.
