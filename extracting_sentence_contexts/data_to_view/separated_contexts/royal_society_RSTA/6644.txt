There is only
small correlation with Chicken Rock and Holyhead-Dublin, and no significant correla-
tion with Fishguard-Rosslare. At the four stations between the Mull of Galloway and Skulmartin L.V. the mean
salinities increase steadily towards the west, though the differences are small and the
Skulmartin series is very short. This fact, coupled with the higher salinity at Stranraer-
Larne, may indicate a south-going current of relatively salt water near the shore off

the north-east coast of Ireland. Such a current would be in harmony with the
suggestions of Nielsen and the Conseil international as mentioned in § 3, and also with
the results of a year’s observations of currents at the Skulmartin L.V. (Proudman
1939) which gave a mean current towards the south-east.
