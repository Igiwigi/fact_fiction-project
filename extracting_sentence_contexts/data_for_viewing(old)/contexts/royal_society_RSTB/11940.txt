Sequencic: To avoid the ambiguity of gene concepts and the negative shade of the term genocentrism, one could use the term
‘sequencic’ when reducing genetics to the sole DNA sequence of nucleotides.

sequences appears insufficient to account for the development (a) Non-genetic transmission of acquired metabolic
and functioning of complex organisms. To account for trans- .
generational resemblance, organisms must transmit more than disorders

the coding DNA sequences, or at least those sequences
should be accompanied by a substantial set of regulatory
molecules in states that persist over generations.

Despite the fact that DNA-sequence definitions of the gene
now dominate, this pervasive vision has been regularly ques-
tioned (e.g. [53]). This questioning gained a lot of momentum
since the beginning of the twenty-first century, mainly because
the extraordinary successes of the dominant vision also high-
lighted its limitations. Among others, a challenge came from
accruing evidence for the existence of non-genetic (non-DNA-
sequence-based) forms of inheritance, to which we turn now.

One of the most striking examples of inheritance of environ-
mentally triggered early in life responses links parental
dietary environment to the phenotype of their descendants.
