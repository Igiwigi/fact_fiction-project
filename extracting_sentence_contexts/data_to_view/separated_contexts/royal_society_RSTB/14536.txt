If males can mate in quick succession most realistic parameter settings (where males are capable
with many females (low 2), it is difficult to evolve any dis- of mating in quick succession), the required frequency of D,
crimination. If replenishment of sperm is so quick that before S females can start benefitting from their attempt to
indiscriminating males never suffer in sperm competition manage male attention, is quite high. The logic here reflects

situations, then there are problems in the spread of the fact that opportunity costs paid by males are low in this


situation (which favours indiscriminate behaviour), and received, and matings therefore correlated negatively with

when most males do not discriminate, females cannot benefit female fitness except for females that remain unmated (the
from a ‘quiet’ period before they start signalling. Simul- risk of which is non-trivial at low male ability to mate multi-
taneously, there needs to be a substantial frequency of S ply, ie. high value of 7). A worthwhile avenue for future work
females before D males can elevate their fitness above d would be to separate the negative effects of harassment from
males.
