over a space extending from the 204th to the g44th order of
distances.

As the power of the 10 feet reflector could not reach far-
ther into'space, I shall have recourse to some of my nume-
rous observations made with the 20' feet telescope. In addi-
tion to 86g gages already published,* above yoo more have
been taken in' various parts of the heavens, but with regard
to these' gages, which on a supposition of an equality of scat-
tering were looked upon as gages of distances, I have now
to remark that, although a greater number of stars in the
field of view is generally an' indication of their greater dis-
tance from us, these gages, in fact, relate more immediately
to the scattering of the stars, of which they give us a valuable
information, such as' will prove the different richness' of the
various regions' of the heavens.

The milky way is extremely rich in stars' that' are too small
for'the"gage.
