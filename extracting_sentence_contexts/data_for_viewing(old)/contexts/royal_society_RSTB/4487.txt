Casr’s early figures of the skull, with the tabulare interpreted as the squamosal
and the anterior cranial walls as the interorbital septum.

In the same year, Moopre* again expressed his objections to the inclusion of
Lysorophus among the Urodeles, alleging that even the presence of limbs, should
they be discovered, would not affect his opinion on this important point. He thus
met by anticipation the force of the discovery made soon afterwards by Miss MArTAN
Fryney,t to whom we are indebted for a full deseription of several femurs and other
isolated bones of the leg, which were found in association with the now well-known
vertebrae.

After a short summary,{ with an added note retracting a previous statement,
WILLISTON returned to the subject in 1912.§ The fact that in this communication
Lysorophus is discussed under the heading of “ Primitive Reptiles,” suggests a change
of view, and some conclusions are reached which leave the impression that the author
is no longer prepared to maintain his original position intact. Thus, after enumerating
its characters, he remarks that, should his account prove to be correct, then “it will
necessarily follow that, if Lysorophus is a real reptile, it must occupy a place all by

This is far, however, from asserting that Lysophorus is a reptile or that it is not
an Amphibian, yet it is easy to understand how a foreigner, like von Hvene,
