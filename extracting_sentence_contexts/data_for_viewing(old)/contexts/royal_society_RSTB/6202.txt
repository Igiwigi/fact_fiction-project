The leafy shoot from the Killingworth Road locality, a portion of which is photo-
graphed of natural size in fig. 3, Plate 29, was over 15 cm long. In total breadth
and in width of stem it agrees with that just described, but the mode of preservation
is different. It is completely flattened on, or in, a thin layer of the matrix that is
darker in colour than the rest of the rock. The remains of the plant are replaced by
a brownish-orange granular material. The individual leaves thus stand out clearly
against the dark matrix, and some of them show the tapering terminal region.

The interest of the specimen in fig. 4, Plate 29, lies in the fact that it was collected
from the Monograptus Beds at one of the Thomson River exposures. Its registration
number is 1144, and it therefore comes in the list of fossils that include graptolites,
from Locality E (BARAGWANATH, 1925). The appressed leaves in the upper part give
the impression of having been rather erect and slender. This is, however, probably
due to imperfect preservation, for the remains of leaves lower down appear similar to
those of the examples described above, i.e., nearly 1 mm wide, over 2 cm long and lax.

The leafy shoots in figs. 1-4 come from three of the localities in which Mono-
graptus is known to occur in close association with the plants. Similar shoots, in
which a fairly stout stem bears closely and equally placed leaves, were collected
from the exposures at Alexandra, but since they add nothing to our knowledge
of the plant need not be described or figured. The shoot from Alexandra shown
