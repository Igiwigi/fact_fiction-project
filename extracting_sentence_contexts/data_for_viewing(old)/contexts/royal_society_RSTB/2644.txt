compared with the Triassic and Jurassic fauna. Amongst other features, the numbers
six and twelve then came more and more to the front in radial symmetry, although
fissiparous and multi-septate Astreids continued the irregularity which had been
natural to them from the first. The number was wholly arbitrary, as is evidenced by

the fact that it became often fixed in genera remote from one another, while nearly
related genera, or even species, differed.

The broad conclusions which J draw from such a review of the Madreporaria
are :—

A. Palaozoic—A. change, which was advantageous, showed itself in Cyatho-
phyllids and in Cyathaxonidx, as early as Silurian and Devonian times ; other types,
which did not participate in the change, or could not rapidly enough adapt their
disconnected habit of growth to it (e.g., the Cystiphyllids), became extinct ; before
the close of the Paleozoic era, rather abnormal “columellar” genera were fashioned
(e.g., the Clisiophyllids), but were apparently unsuccessful ; at the same time a large
group of genera (Zaphrentids) seemed to make no sign of change.
