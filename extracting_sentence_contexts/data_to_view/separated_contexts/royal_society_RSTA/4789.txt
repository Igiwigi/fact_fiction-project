Tile Assembly Model is intrinsically universal, and that this holds with a fairly strict notion 6 |
of simulation, we can attempt to use simulation to tease apart the power of different tile

assembly models. Specifically we ask if natural subclasses of the model can achieve the full a
expressive power of the model via spatially scaled dynamics-preserving simulation and/or if :
such subclasses can even simulate each other.

(a) Separating the power of cooperative and non-cooperative tile assembly systems

It has been known for some time that the abstract Tile Assembly Model at temperature 2, where
at least some of the tiles are required to match on two or more sides for correct binding, i.e.
cooperative binding, is capable of highly non-trivial behaviour. Turing machine simulation [40],

efficient production of n x n squares and other simple size-n shapes using ©(log1/ log log 1) : 2
tile types [48], efficient production of arbitrary finite connected shapes using a number of : =
tile types within a logarithmic factor of the Kolmogorov complexity of the shape [17] and 78
even intrinsic universality [46] (as already discussed) can all be achieved with cooperative, or : 2
temperature 2, growth. : S

The fact that the (full) abstract Tile Assembly Model is intrinsically universal means that there Dos
is a subclass of the model, namely the class of systems that use the intrinsically universal tile set U, : Ss
that is capable of simulating the full model. This suggests an obvious question: can we show that : S
some subclasses of the model are provably weaker than the full model, by showing that systems :s
from these subclasses cannot simulate the full model? : =

The most notorious such subclass is called temperature 1. Despite its esoteric name, it models
a fundamental and ubiquitous form of growth: asynchronous growing and branching tips in
Euclidian space where each new tile is added if it matches on at least one side.
