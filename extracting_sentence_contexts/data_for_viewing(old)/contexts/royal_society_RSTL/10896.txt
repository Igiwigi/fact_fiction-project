ferric oxide. The ferric oxide was obtained by heating pure ferrous sulphate with
sodic sulphate, lixiviating with hot water, and washing many times therewith by
decantation. The oxide was then dissolved in the requisite acids. The observations
recorded in the case of metallic chlorides apply equally well to sulphates and
nitrates, while the difficulty of obtaining a spectrum from ferric phosphate diffused
in glycerine was equal to that in the cage of the sulphide. When dissolved in hydro-
chloric acid the phosphate displayed the lines of iron only. A similar observation
was made with cerous phosphate. Ammonium chloride was made into a saturated
solution, and its spectrum photographed. There was no striking alteration in the
spectrum of the graphite poles, but a careful examination showed that a group of lines
which appear to be caused by the presence of nitrogen was greatly strengthened and
made more prominent. Thess lines or flutings extend from about wave-lengths 3881'8
to 38290. The following facts point to their origin, They are never 8een when
metallic electrodes are used, wet or dry ; they are therefore not air-bauds. They are not
seen when carbon electrodes are immersed in oxygen, and cannot therefore be due to
carbon dioxide. They are always seen when solutions are used with carbon electrodes,

and are particularly strong when the carbons, wet or dry, are immersed in pure and
dry nitrogen. When the negative pole is a metallic wire immersed in water, and the
positive a point of carbon, the lines are strongly developed at the positive pole only.
When the current is reversed the spectrum is not 80 8trong. The bands not being
traceable to carbon dioxide, to a hydrocarbon or to air, and being at the same time
