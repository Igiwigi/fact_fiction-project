As a generalization of (3.19) and (3.20), it seems natural to assume the reduction form as

Xa(t) = x (bu) + €P(Ga, bp) (3.27)
and
ba = + €G(ba, $f) (3.28)

A similar reduction form is also assumed for oscillator 8. The above form must satisfy (3.26). This
requirement leads to the following equation similar to (3.21):

~ d ~ ~
Gloap)¥0(0) — (4 - os) $71(Gu) (arp) =$ba)Blbardp) 829)

The problem arising here is that the lowest-order B contains an unknown quantity p. In fact, we
have
dp (Gar Pp)

B(ba, bp) = V(x (ba), x(p)) — © bp

+ O(€) terms, (3.30)
where the 00/d¢g term is comparable with the V term in magnitude. Thus, finding the solution
by successive iterations seems impossible. Still, G in the lowest order can be determined, because
the unwanted quantity p, and hence the dp/d¢g term, contained in B, is free from the ug(0)
component.

As stated before, in phase reduction and also in centre-manifold reduction, the problem should
