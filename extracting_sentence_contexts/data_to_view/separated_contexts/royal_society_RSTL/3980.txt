* This difference of effect, which establishes a
line of demarcation between these two species of phenomena, is due to this, that the magnetism being very
feeble in the tritoxide of iron, wood, &c., we may neglect the reaction of the body on itself, and therefore the
direct action of the bar ought to overrule it.” As the paper does not refer the phenomena of wood and gum-lac to an elementary repulsive action, nor show
that they are common to an immense class of bodies, nor distinguish this class, which I have called diamagnetic,
from the magnetic class; and, as it makes all magnetic action of one kind, whereas I show that there are two
kinds of such action, as distinct from each other as positive and negative electric action are in their way, 80 I
do not think I need alter a word or the date of that which I have written ; but am most glad here to acknow-
ledge M. Becarzrr's important facts and labours in reference to this subject, —M, F. Dec. 5, 1845,

others, including a vast number of opake and metallic bodies, and perhaps all
except the magnetic metals and their compounds: and they also, through that con-
dition, present us with the means of undertaking the correlation of magnetic pheno-
mena, and perhaps the construction of a theory of general magnetic action founded
on simple fundamental principles.

I must, with every desire to be brief, describe much which” at last will be found to
concentrate under simple principles of action.
