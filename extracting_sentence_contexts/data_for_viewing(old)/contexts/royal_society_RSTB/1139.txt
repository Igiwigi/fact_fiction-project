In these cases therefore all lateral column effects average with minimal stimulus
111, with maximal 166; whilst all posterior column effects average with minimal
stimulus 70, with maximal 145. It is seen that these results are exceptions to the
general rule (see p. 385) of the effect from the posterior being in the Cat larger than
that from the lateral. That this was really due to the prolonged exposure at the
12th dorsal injuriously affecting the posterior columns is shown by the fact that such
exceptional results were only obtained when an intervening portion had been thus
exposed. If prolonged exposure is avoided by performing the necessary operation
mmediately before the desired intervening lesions are to be made no such lowering
of the amvunt of the posterior column effect is observed. In this relation it is
possible to explain the comparatively small posterior column effect (see p. 385) of the
Monkey as in some measure due to a loss of excitability in these columns, which

. seem to be much more susceptible than the laterals (CHAUVEAU).

Influence of Section of one Posterior Column.â€”It is possible to interrupt one
column only, and thus to obtain conclusive evidence of the extent to which the
