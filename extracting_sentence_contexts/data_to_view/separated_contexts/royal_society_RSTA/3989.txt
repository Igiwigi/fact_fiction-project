In the following, both mechanisms are discussed based on the recent
experimental studies. One of the serious drawbacks of the top-down mechanisms is that the presence of giant
fullerenes has not been experimentally confirmed. The top-down mechanisms are based on
the fact that very large fullerenes, the so-called giant fullerenes, exist in carbon plasma. The
only experimental evidence they ascribed is mass spectral observation of row soot-containing

Figure 7. Direct evidence of the bottom-up growth of endohedral metallofullerenes. (a) Larger La,@C,,, endohedral fullerenes
are formed after exposure of La)@Cgp to carbon vapour by laser ablation (50 mJ cm) ofaLa)@Cgo-coated graphite rod; (b) laser
irradiation (50 mJ cm~2) of La;@Cgo without exposure to carbon vapour.
