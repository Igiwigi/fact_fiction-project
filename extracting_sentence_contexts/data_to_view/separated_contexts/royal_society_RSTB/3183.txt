The magnitude of both forces depends upon the
nature of the tube, of the liquid and of the gas, as well as upon the diameter of
the tube, but no comparison such as that given by ZimMERMANN is possible, since the
Jamin’s chain resistance also depends upon the number of menisci in a given length
of the tube. SrraspurceR* has, however, shown that slight pressure will drive
water through a vessel containing a chain of air-bubbles and water columns,
whereas a pressure of more than half an atmosphere may be needed to drive out
the chain as a whole from vessels 20 centims. long. This fact holds good in spite
of ScHWENDENER’s theoretical objections to its possibility, and it is due to the fact
that a rapid flow is required to break even the imperfect adhesions of the menisci
of the air-bubbles to the internal irregularities of the walls. SrraspurGER also
showed that under the same pressure less water flows through vessels containing
air than through ones filled with water. More exact experiments of my ownt have
distinguished between the rate of flow and amount of flow, and between the
different factors affecting them.
