Weibull plots of B3B bending strength of nanocrystalline (a) and microcrystalline (b) diamond foil, both loaded on
the GS (filled data points) as well as the NS (open data points). The NCDF shows quite similar strengths for both sides, whereas
the microcrystalline diamond foil is much weaker on the GS but much stronger on the NS. The latter can be explained by the fact
that optimization of pre-treatment in (b) leads to a higher seeding density than for the NCDF shown in (a) and fewer particle
residues (cf. figure 13).

magnitude of the structure sizes, which is very similar on the NS and on the GS of NCDF. Larger microcrystalline crystals are therefore expected to show less strength, which is proven by
figure 10b. The coarse GS of microcrystalline diamond foil only shows a strength of approximately
2.7GPa with a Weibull modulus of 9.8.
