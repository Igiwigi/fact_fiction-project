these waters. Backscattering measurements, although still susceptible to bio-fouling of the sensor,
are not affected by fluorescence quenching. The glider triplet sensors measured backscattering
at 700nm (not one of the AC-9/BB9 wavelengths) resulting in the requirement for deriving an
additional relationship, linking bj, (700) to Chl (figure 7a). As NOMAD by, data are limited to less
than 683 nm, spectra were extrapolated to 700 nm using a power-law relationship. Barents Sea BB9
data were linearly interpolated to 700nm and were very consistent with NOMAD observations.
For consistency, a power-law was fitted to Barents Sea backscattering data only (see above). This
relationship was subsequently used to convert bpp (700) to Chl (figure 7a and table 3).

Discrepancies between Chl derived from backscattering measurements, Chljpp), and
fluorescence measurements, Clg, increased for very low and very high chlorophyll
concentrations (figure 7b). At high Chl, Chlpy, tended to be higher than Chly (area A, figure 7b).
This was attributed to the fact that Chly is likely to underestimate true chlorophyll concentration
due to fluorescence quenching. High Chl values are found in surface waters in this region
and at this time of year (see later). At low chlorophyll concentrations, Chlpyy, was found to
be higher than Chl_ which could potentially be due to unresolved background particles (not
associated with Chl), a residual offset in the bpp-to-Chl relationship, or limitations in the dynamic
range of the backscattering sensor (area B, figure 7b). Given this limitation, we, therefore,
developed a combined approach for this work, in which Chl was derived from the fluorescence
measurements up to a concentration of 2mgmâ„¢?. For Chly > 2mgm-%, Chl was estimated
based on the backscattering measurement and the relationship obtained from figure 7a. This
