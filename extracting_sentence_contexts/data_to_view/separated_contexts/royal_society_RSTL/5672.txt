If
the crystal be positive, this intersecting line is coincident with the shorter axis of the
elliptical section within the horizontal plane; if it be negative, with the longer axis,
Hence a paramagnetic crystal, when positive, sets its magnetic axis in the axial,
when negative in the equatorial plane of the electro-magnet. In diamagnetic crystals,
when positive, the magnetic axis is forced into the equatorial, when negative into the
axial plane. In order to give a true description of this fact, you may say, in all cases the
magnetic axis of the crystal is either attracted or repelled by the poles. This law can easily be verified in a most distinct way by a great number of paramag-
netic and diamagnetic, positive and negative crystals. I think it therefore not necessary
to refer here to new experiments.
