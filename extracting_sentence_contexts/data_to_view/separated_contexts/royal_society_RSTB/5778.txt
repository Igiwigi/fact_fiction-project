Trans-
ferring 1 Â¢.c. of the fluid to fresh medium carries over the oxidizing power. The presence
of sulphur-oxidizing bacteria is accepted for any sample of stone only after oxidation
of the thiosulphate has been proved to occur in sub-cultures from the original. Working
in this way positive results were obtained for sandstones from Kelso Abbey, fig. 6,

THE RELATIONSHIP OF MICRO-ORGANISMS TO THE DECAY OF STONE, 119

Court, and other places at the Palace of Westminster, fig. 5, Plate 17, fig. 7, Plate 18 ;

Victoria and Albert Museum,

It is seen then that these bacteria have been found in a surprisingly large number
of cases (in fact it is unusual to fail to demonstrate their presence), it must however
be clearly stated that the bacteria are not held to be responsible for the formation of
the sulphates in all these cases. This can readily and adequately be explained on
chemical and physical grounds (see ScHarFER (1981)), and it is not necessary to invoke
the aid of bacteria to explain the oxidation of atmospheric sulphur dioxide. The
existence of organisms possessed of the power to effect the oxidation of lower sulphur
compounds may however assist to explain certain difficult cases where a straightforward
explanation on other grounds is not easily forthcoming.
