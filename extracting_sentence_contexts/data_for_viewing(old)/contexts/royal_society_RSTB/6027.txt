ordinary bone cells of the jaw are themselves degenerating and finding it hard to survive,
and despite the fact that even a healthy pulp is incapable of forming bone. Indeed, it
is difficult to see what use a dental pulp would have for a bony skeleton in any circum-
stances ; so useless indeed would the tissue be that it would have to be regarded as
virtually a neoplasm.

The only evidence that the new tissue is bone is its superficial resemblance to bony
trabecule, though in ground sections this resemblance entirely disappears, fig. 12. It
is also suggested that the degenerating cells included in it resemble osteoblasts. There
are, however, no Haversian systems to be seen and no embryonic mesoderm cells which
might be developing into osteoblasts—on the contrary, all the pulp cells, so far from
undergoing mitosis, are admittedly degenerating, and it is difficult to see how any of
them could be mistaken for osteoblasts. The cells are, in fact, so degenerated that it
would seem impossible from their appearance alone to say what they had been. Even
if they did resemble osteoblasts the case would not be proved, for it has been shown
(Fisu, 1932, fig. 35, A) that such cells often appear associated with the development of
secondary dentine in the ordinary reactions of teeth in monkeys and other animals—
but only in an otherwise healthy pulp.

The “ Pulp bone” theory presents a bewildering picture quite as inexplicable on
general biological grounds as it is unprecedented in any other form of pulp irritation,
and it leaves entirely out of account any reaction to the death of the primary dentine.

It is significant that this tissue, whether it be calcific scar tissue or pulp bone, develops
not only in the pulp chambers of animals suffering from subscurvy, but also in the pulp
