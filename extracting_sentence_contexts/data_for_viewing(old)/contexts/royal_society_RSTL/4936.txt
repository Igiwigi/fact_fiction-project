tion after they had remained from thirty to forty minutes in water. On careful
examination of Prevosr and Duwas' experiments, I think the difference may perhaps
be due to a circumstance which seems equally to affect some of SPpaLLaNzants
results, namely, the mode in which the impregnating fluid employed was obtained.
These authors state that the fluid they employed was expressed from the testicles of
the frogs, s0 that from what we now know of the mode of origin of the sperma-
tozoa, this fluid in all probability contained a large proportion of developmental cells
that included spermatozoa not fully matured, but which might become liberated in
the water at a longer or shorter period. Or, possibly, the fluid added to ova that
had been long in the water, had been very recently obtained ; in which case the
vigorous spermatozoa might effect the impregnation of ova that had become almost
insusceptible through the imbibition of water by their enyelopes. I am led to this
view by the fact that the jelly-like envelope of the Frog's egg begins to imbibe and
expand the instant it is brought into contact with fluid ; and from having ascertained
that there is a close relation between the degree of expansion and imbibition of this
envelope and the susceptibility of the ovum to become impregnated, and that these
conditions are also greatly affected by temperature. The act of expansion of the
envelope is an act of endosmose, and possibly this is one of the means by which the
impregnating agent is made to exert its influence on the yelk. The yelk is not a
passive recipient during the endosmic action of its coyerings, but seems to partici-
pate in that action, as I have seen portions of its surface heave and contract within
the vitelline membrane during the first hour the egg has remained in water. It may
thence be inferred, that if the impregnating stimulus be not supplied quickly, the
fitness of the oyum to become impregnated is diminished in proportion as its enve-
lopes are expanded. If then it be proved that the spermatozoon is the agent in impreg-
