Except possibly in the very youngest stages, the course of progression is a
a” spiral, the body turning round on its long axis during the forward movement, now in
S one sense, now in the other. The rotating movement is produced by the action of the
© shorter flagellum, working laterally, helped by the spiral twist of the body in the
= spiral forms. The propulsion is caused chiefly by the more posteriorly directed
oo flagellum.
3 Phyllomitus.—The interesting peculiarity of this form is that the long and short
flagellum, doubtless representing an anterior and a posterior one, are partly joined
> _ together by a band, just as was shown by SrerN in his original figures, a fact which
‘3 hitherto has never been confirmed. In consequence of this attachment, both flagella
— are always directed backwards in life, for the long one, which is much longer than the
& body, represents a trailing flagellum. The distal portion of the short flagellum is
% free from the band.
