froma domain-independent bias for compressibility in learning,
and pressure for expressivity arising from language use in com-
munication’ [155]. Iterated learning experiments show that the
combination of the two pressures—the first simulated by verti-
cal transmission between generations of learners; the other, by
interactions between learners from the same generation—
leads to the emergence of language-like structure [155,156].
This account, implying the evolution of language from
pantomime, mostly through cultural evolution, leaves several
important questions unaddressed. First, globally the most pro-
minent manifestation of language is speech. Accounting for
this fact is notoriously difficult for all gestural and pantomimic
approaches to language origins. This difficulty, sometimes
referred to as the ‘modality transition problem’, has long been
recognized by language-origins theorists (e.g. [157-159]; see
esp. [160], pp. 433-465), and we extensively discuss it in our pre-
vious work (esp. [161], pp. 235-276). While no single convincing
counter-argument has been elaborated to solve the ‘modality
transition problem’, it is crucial to note that mimetic-pantomi-
mic theories are much less vulnerable to this problem than
gesture-first theories (Wacewicz and Zywiczynski in press
[49]), in that they do not posit a transition from gesture to voca-
lization but rather from an original system of communication to
a current one, both of which are essentially polysemiotic. As we
