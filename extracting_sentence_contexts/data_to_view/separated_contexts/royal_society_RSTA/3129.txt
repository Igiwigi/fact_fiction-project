These phenomena are shown in a striking fashion by
comparing the data of Table XVIII. with corresponding data for Jersey* based on
observations by DECHEVRENS. In view of these facts, it is highly significant that the general resemblance that
has been noticed between the diurnal inequalities of potential gradient and barometric
pressure is now found to proceed almost entirely from the parts that have a 12-hour
period. At Kew, at least, so far as the 24-hour terms are concerned, it isa case not
of resemblance, but of marked dissimilarity. During the seven years whose data have been considered, the charge of the
electrograph and the taking of the absolute observations have devolved upon
Mr. E, G, Consrasxe, the Senior Assistant engaged in the meteorological work of
the Observatory Department, and his Junior Assistant, Mr. E. Boxatn.
