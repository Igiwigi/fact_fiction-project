A gradual fall in the readings of the latter

soon becomes apparent, Again, on allowing the pressure to rise to its original value,
one finds the aneroid read lower than at the start, this depression gradually
disappearing. The instrument, in fact, behaves as if an imperfectly elastic body. The strain, under a uniform stress, tends to increase, and as a natural concomitant,
there is elastic after-effect (elastische Nachwirkung). That the whole of the difference
between readings with pressure descending and ascending (or, as we shall call them
for brevity, descending and ascending readings) represents, in all cases, a true after-
effect, I am not prepared to say.
