The previous section showed how the damping
in our system (equation (2.1) with F =0) reduces the high-amplitude oscillations of Region IV
(yellow in figure 4) making the trajectories fall into the fixed point (dark blue in figure 4). This
change may be undesired, particularly because a small variation in the time delay may cause a
dramatic change in the dynamics. In fact, in the amplitude basins the yellow and blue basins are
intermingled due to the damping-induced fractalization of the parameter space. The phenomenon of delay-induced resonance studied in [16] for the overdamped case implies
that even for the parameter values for which the time delay does not induce sustained oscillations
a resonance may appear following a different mechanism. Our scenario is different, as the
underdamped oscillator presents oscillations and the damping term, for certain values, eliminates
these oscillations.
