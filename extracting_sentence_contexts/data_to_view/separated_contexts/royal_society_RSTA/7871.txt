It is possibly for such reason that diethyl peroxide (0-5) did
6 not seem to change the ignition temperature of a pentane mixture in our experi-
~j ments on ignition under pressure, whereas acetaldehyde, according to TOWNEND’s
3 observations, lowers the ignition point very markedly ; the diethyl peroxide
undergoes combustion at the surface of the pressure vessel and is not exposed to the
E extreme conditions necessary for its disruption. Acetaldehyde undoubtedly forms
A acetyl peroxide during its photochemical oxidationt and also probably during its
thermal oxidation.¢ In the engine, conditions are either such that it is burnt as fast as
formed without disruption, or that the rate of formation is too low for an appreciable
amount of aldehyde peroxide to be formed and stabilized in the time available, except
at concentrations of aldehyde above 20%. In the ignition apparatus, however, the
aldehyde peroxide may be formed and may influence the ignition ; in fact, it seems
