The
results presented in [16] provide experimental support for this claim in the appropriate parameter
regimes. For a theoretical treatment, we consider in the following the case of a cigar-shaped cloud
elongated along the coordinate x transverse to the propagation direction z, so that transverse
self-organization will lead to one-dimensional structures. Our theoretical analysis [15] indicates
in fact that no qualitative differences are expected for the dynamics of one- and two-dimensional
systems, and restricting to one dimension allows for a connection with temporal synchronization
phenomena. We neglect propagation inside the cloud and account for diffraction of the
transmitted field only in the free-space propagation to the mirror and back. For the parameters
considered here, this simplifying assumption provides good qualitative agreement with more
detailed models in which diffraction within the medium is also taken into consideration, as
discussed in [16].
