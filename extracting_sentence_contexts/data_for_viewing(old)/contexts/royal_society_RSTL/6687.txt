RADIATION OF HEAT BY GASEOUS MATTER. 65

numerous applications of the apparatus. In all the experiments the tube remained
perfectly transparent throughout, and, on pumping, the needle in each case returned
accurately to zero.

In my last paper I brought the fact s0mewhat prominently forward that the elementary
bodies which I had then examined were far less hostile to the passage of the longer
undulations than the compound ones; and I founded at the time certain theoretic con-
siderations on this fact*. TI was desirous this year to extend the experiments to one or
two of the coloured gases and vapours, and on the 20th of September resumed my expe-
riments on chlorine. This gas is itself highly coloured, and of a specific gravity of
2-45; one of its compounds, hydrochloric acid, is quite transparent, and of specific
gravity of only 1:26. Does the act of combination with hydrogen which renders
chlorine gas more transparent to light render it also more transparent to heat ? Chlorine
prepared from hydrochloric acid and peroxide of manganese, and dried by passing it
through sulphuric acid, was admitted into the tube till it depressed the mercury gauge
21 inches; the absorption of the gas was expressed by the number 44.

Hydrochloric acid was admitted till it depressed the gauge 19 inches; the absorption
was 68. This experiment indicates that transparency to light and opacity to heat
accompany the same act of chemical union.
