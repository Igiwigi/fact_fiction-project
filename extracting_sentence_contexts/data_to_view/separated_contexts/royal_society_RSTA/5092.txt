where C; is a proportionality constant. Combining equations (4.6)-(4.8), the following expression
for the position where the tip vortices break down can be obtained:

(1) _ —16u8
R/preakdown Np&Cr

It should be noted that the minus sign is due to the fact that the turbulence intensity is
always less than 1 and the natural logarithm as a consequence is negative. This expression
gives a measure of the position where the helical tip vortices break down as a function of the
intensity of the ambient turbulence level and of parameters depending uniquely on the turbine’s
operational characteristics. In order to evaluate the unknown parameters U, and Ci, numerical
simulations were conducted on the small-scale wind turbine using different intensities of the
inflow turbulence.
