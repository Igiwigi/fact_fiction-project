7. Conclusion

Positioned within the structural and functional specifications of the RAMI 4.0 and the concrete
implementation of an AAS, this work introduced the significant implications of a radical
paradigm change in the engineering and operation of industrial systems generated by worldwide
ongoing industrial digital transformation efforts. The discussion focused on the positions and
roles of humans, on the symbiosis of digitalized humans and assets that cohabit a collaborative-
driven industrial ecosystem and how these digitally transformed industrial environments are
empowering human capabilities and interactions. Moreover, it has been discoursed that human-
focused efforts in Industry 4.0 should be seen in the larger context of sustainability and circular
economy in order to properly consider the interplay of the involved socio-technical dimensions.
The next step, beyond the innovation possibilities provided by the digitalization process, will
be to actually create organizations able to reinforce the fact that the human-centred approach
unleashes the human potential, drives new forms of value creation and realizes sustainability.
