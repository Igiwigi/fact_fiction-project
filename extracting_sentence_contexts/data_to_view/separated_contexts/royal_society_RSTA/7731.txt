in comparing the calculated and observed specific heat, about 10%, as mentioned
above, and the greater part of it is undoubtedly due to the neglect of the thermal
capacity of the part of the thermocouple in contact with the specimen. The dis-
crepancy, however, is greater for H = 7000 over the range T = 300°—360°, being
about 25°. It probably arises from the fact that the value of C, used corresponds
to constant intrinsic magnetization ; and this will differ more from the value
appropriate for constant apparent magnetization (which strictly is required) at the
lower than at the higher fields. Apart from this, the general agreement between
the values of (1/c) (@E/éc) derived from the two sets of data, allowing for a correction
for the thermal capacity of the thermocouple, is remarkably close. TABLE v—— 1 (2) <x 10° For NickeL From Macnetro-Cautoric DATA.

Intrinsic Magnetization in Zero Field

The preceding results show that at a particular temperature the value of
(1/s) (@E/@s) may depend on the field when g is the apparent magnetization, even
for fields above 7000 gauss.
