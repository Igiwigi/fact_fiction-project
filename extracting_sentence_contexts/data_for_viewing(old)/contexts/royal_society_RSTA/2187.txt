Armed with the start of a theory of harmonic Maass forms, as well as Zwegers’ important work,
Ono, Rhoades and the author revisited Ramanujan’s asymptotic claim about the mock theta
function f and the modular form b (described in §1). We sought to better understand the implied
O(1) constants, and wondered if there could be any connection between what Ramanujan was

studying in 1920, and quantum modular forms, defined 90 years later in 2010 by Zagier. Quantum : =
modular forms, which we more precisely define below, transform like modular forms but with : Ed
some notable differences: they are defined on Q as opposed to H, and they transform only up to : 2
additive error terms, which are required to extend to suitably analytic or continuous functions in : >
R. It may be unclear from this terse description why we imagined quantum modular forms may : 8
be at play in Ramanujan’s asymptotic claim. In fact, we saw potential hints in the transformation Los
exhibited by f(q) on H (see Watson’s theorem in §1), and also in Ramanujan’s asymptotic claim: if : <
we rewrite q =e!" where t € H, then q > ¢ (a root of unity) radially is equivalent to t > x €Q, : >
a rational number, vertically. ia
More precisely, we have the following definition of a quantum modular form, which we Dy
attribute to Zagier [19], noting that his original definition was slightly more restrictive. : 8
