purpose. I was astonished to find that these liquors contained scarcely a trace of
ammonia or any other organic bases. The woody portions therefore of the stems
and trunks of trees appear to be almost entirely devoid of nitrogenous matter, in
which respect they exhibit a remarkable contrast to peat.

This circumstance appears to me as perhaps calculated to throw some light upon
a question of great interest to geologists, viz. the origin of the coal-beds. Whether
therefore have the coal-beds been formed by the snbmersion of whole forrests and
the floating of uprooted timber into estuaries and lakes, or whether are they due to
the submersion of beds of peat ? Now irrespective of all other considerations which
might be urged in favour of the latter opinion, I would remark that the amount of
nitrogen in coal, and consequently the quantity of ammonia and other bases which it
yields when destructively distilled, are very considerable, constituting in fact an ex-
tensive branch of chemical manufacture. Wood, however, as we have just seen,
appears to be quite incapable of furnishing the amount of nitrogen which we find
existing in coal. Peat, on the other hand, from the quantity of ammonia and other
bases which it yields when destructively distilled, is capable of furnishing more than
the required amount of ammonia. This circumstance appears therefore highly con-
firmatory of the opinion, that the true source of coal is only to be sought for in peat.

As was already observed, I expected to have been able to procure from peat, in
addition to ammonia, aniline, quinoline, picoline and the other coal bases. I did
not find these however, but merely an analogous series of bases. I can only account
for this result on the ass8uwmption that the different genera of plants, when destruc-
tively distilled, yield different series of organic bases. This we already know to be
