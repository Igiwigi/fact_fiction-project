energy density implies that this will be a de Sitter universe. This is likely to be unrealizable by any :s
cosmological compactification of string /M-theory, so it is natural to seek alternative possibilities 1m
that could be both realizable and compatible with observations. As noted above in the context
of an effective four-dimensional theory with a positive potential V(o) without stationary points,
E(t) < Vmax for any given flat FLRW solution, where Vmax is a maximum value of V that is reached
when o =0. Around this time, €(t) is approximately constant, and the scale factor S(t) grows
exponentially, as in the de Sitter universe. However, this de Sitter-like phase is transient.

For the simple one-scalar model with exponential potential discussed earlier, there is only one
phase of transient acceleration if a = 3IV'I/ V > 1. This is likely to remain true for arbitrary one-
scalar positive potentials (unless 31V'| /V <1 for some values of o) because this is needed for
late-time acceleration. In any case, there is no known one-scalar example found by cosmological
compactification (and this fact is likely related to the de Sitter swampland conjecture that requires
|V'\/V > C for some (unknown) constant of order 1 [39]). However, for a simple dilaton-axion
model with

1
E= 56? +e ¥7) 4 Ae, (3.6)

there can be multiple phases of accelerating expansion when a > 1 (and even a > 1) if the dilaton-
axion coupling constant f is sufficiently large; this is the phenomenon of ‘recurrent acceleration’
[51]. A large dilaton-axion coupling will rapidly convert dilaton kinetic energy into axion kinetic
energy, which slows the descent down the exponential potential; the energy density is now
decreasing more slowly, sufficiently to drive an accelerated expansion. But then the axion kinetic
energy is reconverted into dilaton kinetic energy, which speeds up the descent down the potential;
