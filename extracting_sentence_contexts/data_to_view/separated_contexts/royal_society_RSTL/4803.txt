After many attempts, which remained long unsuccessful on account of the facility
with which this class of bodies is altered, we at last succeeded in obtaining, not only the
alcohol and ether of this series (for which we have adopted the name of the © Ally
Series”), but also a very considerable number of compound ethers, and some of their
derivatives. In order to arrive at this result, we have submitted many silyer-salts to the action
of iodide of allyl, expecting to obtain by double decomposition iodide of silver and a
compound ether, from which it would be possible afterwards to extract the alcohol. The silver-salts are in general powerfully attacked by iodide of allyl, but comparatively
