formation or cloud and fog droplet deposition on the canopy)
[28] or the enhancement of precipitation by forest vegetation
[29-32]. However, these effects are overall less widespread
than the reduction in water availability typically resulting
from small scale afforestation and forest recovery. In fact,
while ‘occult precipitation’ is typical of cloud forests and
coastal woodlands adjacent to cold ocean surfaces, precipi-
tation enhancement by forestation is expected to be
important only if it affects relatively large continental regions
(of the order of hundreds of km) [33]. These effects are not
accounted for in this study because, despite some recent
claims [4], in the short term a precipitation increase is unli-
kely to result from forestation efforts or facilitate forest
establishment. Agroforestry has been used as a technique to revert deser-
tification and land degradation in China, the middle East and
sub-Saharan Africa [34].
