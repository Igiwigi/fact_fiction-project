to be noted and
a strengthening of the processus lateralis anterior (pvoe./.a.). Meckel’s Curtilage, Auditory Ossicles and Dentary. The changes in the lower jaw consequent upon development are interesting and
worthy of a detailed description in spite of the fact that they have been previously
described by Parmer (35). At this stage Meckel’s cartilages appear to occupy quite
a secondary place in the formation of the lower jaw; they no longer meet at the
anterior end but have shrunk back and are not seen in the sections until No. 70
(fig. 12). Each is also much slighter, and in section is quite small and almost
circular.
