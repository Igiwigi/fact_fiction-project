As we already observed, scale : re
invariance would forbid basic properties we seem to need, like particle masses. That difficulty DN
might not be insuperable, as we have become accustomed to exploiting hidden (spontaneously : =z
broken) symmetries of equations that are not manifest in their stable solutions. More difficult :&

to finesse, it seems, is the fact that local-scale symmetry is in tension with the basic structure of
interacting quantum field theory, due to the need for renormalizationâ€”running of couplings. This
effect brings in distance dependence, even when the underlying classical theory is scale invariant. Remarkably, that difficulty may well prove to be a blessing in disguise.
