their relative arrangement, and the filaments only exaggerate the curvatures
impressed on them in the young bud. Pollen is early developed in the anthers, and
these latter complete their histological details. Great advance is seen in the staminal
tube which closely invests the nucellus region of the ovule, now grown to a pyriform
mass enclosed by a relatively thin integument ; this is continued into a long tube now
definitely kinked on the posterior side, but retaining the stigmatic head well pressed
against the investing perianth. Four special growth-extensions may be noted :
(1) gamophyllous zone of the perianth ; (2) staminal tube ; (3) staminal filaments ;
(4) “stylar” tube of integument.

Growth-curvatures are seen in: (1) the staminal filaments ; (2) the stylar tube ;
these appear to be largely accidental features of growth, due in the former case to
the fact that two lateral stamen-primordia were dropped below the horizontal level of

the others to begin with, and so tend to curl back from the bud-margin under the
others; while in the latter case the curve of the style merely follows the line of least
resistance inside the packed bud, and expresses the energy with which the “stigmatic
disc” is pressed against the boundary of the bud (figs. 14 and 20),
