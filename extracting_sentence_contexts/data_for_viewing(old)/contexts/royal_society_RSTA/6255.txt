of invariant distribution 7;; e.g. Metropolis—Hastings. Then we select the corresponding backward
kernel /;_1 as the reversal of my, i.e.

mee (Zp—1) Me (Zp—1, Zt) = Te(Ze Nya Zt, 24-1), (3.6)

so in particular we have 1;_; =m; if my; is reversible w.r.t. 2. Implicitly, the reversal of m; means
the kernel associated with the time-reversed process of that with transition dynamics given by m;,
that begins in stationarity. When (3.6) is satisfied, we can easily check that the evidence estimate
equation (3.5) simplifies and becomes equal to

V(t)
This estimate is elegant but it is unfortunately d difficult to obtain a low-variance estimate of the
gradient of this ELBO. This is due to the fact that the transition kernels m; will typically involve
accept/reject steps.

Consider for example that 1m; is a Metropolis-Hastings type kernel. We follow here the
derivation by Thin et al. [16]. If we use a reparameterized proposal then we can write

mi(zea,20)= | m( Cra, n),20)8) du, G8)
where g(u) is typically a standard multivariate normal and

Ne ((Zp-1, W), Ze) = oe (Zp—1, H)85,(z,4 0) (Zt) + {1 — oe (Zp—-1, Ue) }5z,_, (Zt), (3.9)

where 6,(z’) denotes the Dirac delta function, and S;(z;~1,u) denotes the Metropolis—Hastings
proposal from point z;_; with noise u (sampled from the distribution g). For example, if
