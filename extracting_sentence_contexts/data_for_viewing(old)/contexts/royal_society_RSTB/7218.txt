a 119. A proof of formulae (117-2) or (118-1) under restrictions already mentioned is
given in Appendix 2 at the end of this Part. It may be noted here that these restrictions are
® not satisfied in the case of random-space distributions. Hence for such random-space
&% distributions the above formulae would not be valid; and in fact (117-2) would have no
= significance, as p(i,j) would be statistically zero for all values of (i, 7). For a non-random
= (or patterned) field these formulae may or may not hold, depending upon the nature of
distribution of the variate over the field and the size of the gap (7,7). For fields and gaps in
® which the above formulae are valid, the quantities G,,, G,, and G,, may be regarded as
fundamental parameters in the characterization of the field in question. Having calculated
a these parameters the correlation function for a gap (i,j) can be obtained by any of the
= foregoing formulae and hence the variance function by (105-1) or (106-1). This, of course,
é considerably simplifies the task of calculation of either the variance function for any grid
2 pattern or correlation function for any gap.
& 120. Fora non-random field and a gap not subject to the restrictions under which the
® foregoing formulae are valid, the correlation function is given by another group of approxi-
