This study is motivated by the need for some offshore structures, such as oil production
platforms and wind farms, to be built far north in ice-covered waters [4]. The aim of the paper is
to explain the application of the vertical mode method to three-dimensional problems of flexural-
gravity waves interacting with vertical cylinders. If the wave-structure interaction problem has a
unique solution, then the vertical mode method provides this solution, despite the fact that the
vertical modes are linearly dependent and not necessary form a complete set of functions, see §5.

2. Formulation of the problem

The fluid flow and ice deflection are caused by an incident hydroelastic wave,
Wine(X, t) = A cos (kx — wf), (2.1)

propagating in the positive x-direction (figure 1), where A is the amplitude of the incident wave,
k is the wavenumber and is the wave frequency. A tilde stands for dimensional variables.
