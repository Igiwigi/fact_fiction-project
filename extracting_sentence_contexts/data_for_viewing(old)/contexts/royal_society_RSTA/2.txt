To show the variation in the pad’s thickness when progressing from an uncoated to a coated
area, cross-sectional profiles of the pad 2 specimen were generated. Figure 4a shows the profile
from two cross-sections at 50x magnification from the uncoated (left-hand side of the plot) to
the coated area (right-hand side of the plot). The location of the cross-sections is traced in figure
4b,c where some graphene nanoplatelets are visible in the uncoated bright areas. Because there
are inconsistent rises in the cross-sectional profiles which were only expected to coincide with
the presence of graphene covering, the results cannot be considered conclusive. We believe this
is due to the high unevenness of the surface of the RR substrate that can be appreciated in the
three-dimensional image presented in figure 5.

Graphene was inevitably deposited on the mask during the deposition. In order to estimate
the thickness of the graphene nanoplatelets’ cumulative cycles, an analysis of a scratch made
on the coated mask was carried out, taking advantage of the fact that the surface of the brass
mask is more uniform compared with the surface of the rubber. Figure 6a,b shows the profiles
at 200x magnification traced on the scratched area and on the graphene-coated area used to
estimate the thickness of the graphene coating. The gap between the two topographic profiles
is around 11 «1m, which was estimated to be the thickness of the 150 cumulative cycles of
graphene nanoplatelets.
