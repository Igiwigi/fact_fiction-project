In this case

& = 5x 10-71(0+-7,)-1 cm.3/sec. Sh 10/7, cm:*)sec.,

since @ is much smaller than rp, which is unlikely to be less than 10-8 sec. In fact radiative
stabilization, for process A, can only occur through vibrational transitions or electronic
quadrupole and magnetic dipole transitions, for which 7, will be greater than 10~Â° sec.,
will be negligibly small in all cases. This gives an attachment coefficient of less than
5x 10718 cm.*/sec., which is 10 times smaller than the rates observed by Bradbury. For process B greater deactivation cross-sections are required even if allowance is made
for the possibility that several vibration levels of the O; complex may contribute.
