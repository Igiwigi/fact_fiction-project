where D =[1+0(1+iA)/(1 —iA)]~!, and y =1/2(Eo/w)? is the effective rocking parameter, to
be compared with (3.9). Equation (5.3) is a CGLE with broken phase invariance, similar to
equation (3.8), as expected, which evidences the main effect of rocking: the emergence of a
phase bistability. Equation (5.3) has been derived under the assumptions A > 0 and a,b = O(c").
(The latter defines so-called class C lasers.) The detuning condition follows from analysing the
diffusion coefficient, given by Re(iD) = 20 A/[(1 +0)? + (1 —0)*A?], which becomes negative
(and then equation (5.3) loses its validity) when A <0 [55,56]. On physical grounds, for A <0,
lasing involves off axis emission (tilted waves, having a spatial dependence), which equation (5.3)
cannot account for, and a different treatment is necessary. In fact, for small A (either positive or
negative), a complex Swift-Hohenberg equation, not a CGL equation, governs the dynamics of
the free-running laser (and of other nonlinear optical cavities) [41,56,58,59,61-63]. Nevertheless,
the specific description (CGL or Swift-Hohenberg) is not essential regarding the effects of rocking,
as discussed in [41]. Concerning the size of the normalized decay rates o and b, equation (5.3) is
valid for any value of o; in particular, in the usual case o <1 (so-called class A laser), D> 1
simply. However, if b <1 (a situation characterizing the so-called class B lasers, like solid-state
and semiconductor lasers), not a single equation, but two, are needed to capture the system
dynamics: one for E and one for N [44,62,63]. In such case, few analytical insights can be gained;
nevertheless, rocking is efficient as well in class B lasers.
