sonrce at an elevation baving a mean temperature lower than that of the plain where
the water appears. on the surface.

2nd. The temperature of strongly saline and sulphureous springs is, on the average,
higher than those of pure water.

3rd. Both saline and cold springs are seen to occur within a few feet from thermal
and freshbwater springs; . a fact to be ascribed probably to their rising through
different seams of the subjacent strata (often highly inclined), and to the different
depths and heights from which the supply of water is derived.

4th. The temperature of wells, particularly those with a small area, much used for
purposes of irrigation, is thereby artificially increased.

5th. The temperature of shallow exposed wells, springs and rivers, especially such
as have sandy beds, is subject to great dinrnal fluctuation, conforming, though to a
less extent, to that of the superincumbent atmosphere. The surface water of deep
wells partakes of this fluctuation, to a depth varying according to the transparency
of the water, extent of surface, degree of exposure, and clearness of the sky. In
muddy water the surface is heated to a greater extent, but a foot or two deep is less
