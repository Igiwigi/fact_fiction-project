a plate consisting of two pinholes on the same radius but with an angular separation, 6. The
initial value of 6 was chosen such one pinhole overlapped with an even mode, and the other
an odd mode; the measured visibility was low. As @ was increased to sample the same mode
(different regions of only the even or only the odd mode), so the visibility increased. The period
of the oscillation in the visibility was consistent with the expected peak separations with odd and

Modes [20]. Two pinholes are moved through a donut beam and the resulting transmitted light was overlapped spatially with 24
a lens. When the pinholes transmit light from the same petal structure (odd/even mode), the overlap forms an interference ae
pattern (a). When the pinholes are positioned to sample one petal of each mode, one odd and one even, then the interference : g

even mode mixing. These results conclusively showed that, while the observed field appears to
be a Laguerre-Gaussian azimuthal mode, it was in fact not; rather, its field was that described
by equation (2.5). This raises questions about some statements in the literature claiming OAM
generation from lasers based only on intensity measurements but without confirmation of the
azimuthal phase (see for example [47,49-51]).
