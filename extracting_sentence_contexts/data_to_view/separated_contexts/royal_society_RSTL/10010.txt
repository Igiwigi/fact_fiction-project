They tend to show
that the difference in question is one of frequent (perhaps constant) occurrence in
unexcited leaves, and that it diminishes in consequence of excitation. We now proceed to the study of the second, and much more important, of the two

- 8tatements made in our previous paper relating to the electromotive properties of the
resting leaf. The fact that the external surface of the lobe is positive to the internal
gurface opposite to it, we propose to designate by the term * eross difference,‚Äù which
sufficiently expresses its own meaning. It will be remembered that the existence of
any 8uch difference is denied by Professxor MUNK, who holds that the opposite
surfaces of the lobe are isoelectrical. In a preliminary series of observations made in the Laboratory of the Royal Gardens
at the same time with those already referred to no exceptions were met with.
