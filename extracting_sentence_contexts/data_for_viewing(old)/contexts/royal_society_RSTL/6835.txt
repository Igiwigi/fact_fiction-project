Although IT have for convenience made use of the ordinary word © nucleus,” it must
be understood that it is used only in a general sense ; for I maintain that the matter
around the nucleus differs from that of the nucleus itself only in having reached a further
stage of existence. My meaning will be readily nnderstood by the following statement,
which is 8upported by evidence already adduced (pages 548, 549). The whole of the
germinal matter, of which the young cell is almost entirely composed, may divide and
subdivide, and from it any number of new cells may be produced. Nor is it necessary
that a * nucleus” should be present in the detached portion. 'The * nuclens” is often.

not to be distinguished until s0me time afterwards. 'This fact may be obseryed in the
germination of pus and mucus. Neither * nucleus” nor * nucleolus,” therefore, are
bodies possessing peculiar powers or actions upon matter around them, nor is the * nucleus”
essential to the being or to the multiplication of a © cell” or elementary part. Nuclei
are but new centres which appear in preexisting germinal matter; and in these again
new centres may arise, and 80 on, centre within centre. In some of the nerve-cells there
1s but one such centre, in others more than one. In some the © nucleus” is dividing
(figs. 11 & 12). The terms nucleus, nucleolus, nucleolulus are arbitrary, and indicate
germinal centres, which have appeared one after and one within the other. These
consist of living matter in different phases of existence.

After a time the germinal matter of which a young *cell” is composed, at its outer part
undergoes conversion into formed material. This formed material cannot produce new
