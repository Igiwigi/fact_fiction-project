her finger bled- indeed; |
The-woman's huſband, who ſerved thatcher, flew to
the place in an inſtant, and turning 'up the ſtraw,
found a flow-worm, and killed hing dire&ly. I know-
ing they generally lie in pairs, ordered the man to look
farther, for that afluredly he had-a companion, and
accordingly the other was quickly found. During this
buſtle, the woman's ailment was quite forgot; and ſhe
fell to work again, as if nothing had happened, My
wife; indeed, about an hour afterwards, hearing of the
accident; dreſſed the wound with ſalad oil, and cauſed
the woman to drink two or three ſpoonfulls of the
fame ; but-as this was: done ſo long after the fact, I
looked upon it as doing of nothing. The ſecond accident happened in the beginning of
July 1754, to the huſband of the above-mentioned
woman, John Seymour, of this town; who in re-
moving the ground-pinning of ſome houſes, which!
had-been- burnt down, and which I had the care of
rebuilding, cried out, that he was ſtung by a blind-
worm, for ſo they call them here. I was by, and'
faw the reptile ſtick.
