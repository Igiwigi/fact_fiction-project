L, : Ex — V", thus yielding the bijection g, = L; o A we sought.

Similarly, we construct a bijection between E\B and V°. Let L2(B) denote the collection of
nodes in G’ induced by edges B. There is a natural bijection Lz : E\B > V(G’)\L2(B). Then as
we eliminate exactly the set L7(B) of nodes in the line-graph to form G* there is trivially a
bijection E : V(G’)\L2(B) > V° (E for ‘elimination’) and thus we find a bijection g2 = E o Ly. Hence
~=g20 0: is a bijection V* > V°.

Now we show that this bijection is indeed an isomorphism. Let u,v € V". We will show that
(u,v) € E” if and only if either (i) ou) is an edge entering X and 9 (x) is an edge leaving X
or (ii) the edges gy MW) and gy 1(v) in G lie end to end with the destination node of gy la) being
the origin of gy, lv), We shall also prove the analogous statement but taking instead u,v € V° and
replacing ¢; with ¢ in the above. These two facts together imply g is an isomorphism.


Suppose (u,v) € E", then certainly the edges Ly lu) and Ly1(v) in Ex lie end to end with the
destination s of Ly 1(u) equalling the origin of Ly! (v). We consider two cases. First, suppose that s 4
X (remember, when we aggregate a collection of nodes X in G we denote by X also the supernode
in Gx). Then, upon undoing the aggregation, the nodes ou) =Ato Ly 1(u) and ov) =A-lo
Ly(v) still lie end to end. In the case s = X then clearly gu) =A-lo Ly(u) is an edge entering
X and g7!(v) =A7!o L{1(v) is an edge leaving X since this is the only way that the destination
of Ly lu) and origin of Ly1(v) are both X.

Conversely suppose u,v are such that either (i) or (ii) holds. If we are in case (i) then the
destination of Ly lu) =Ao ou) and the origin of Ly) =Ao (uv) are both X. As this means
