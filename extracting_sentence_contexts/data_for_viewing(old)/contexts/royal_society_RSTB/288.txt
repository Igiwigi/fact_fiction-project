Whatever may be the case with figs. 17 and 18, I think there can be no doubt
that fig. 20 is a transverse section of a true triarch root, enlarged 42 diameters.
Fig. 21 represents the centre of the same section still further enlarged ; @ is a
triarch vascular bundle; 6, a concentric phloém; d, cycloidally arranged cells of
the cortex.

Fig. 22 (Plate 8) is an oblique transverse section of a cylindric rootlet of another
description ; at a a few vessels or tracheids occupy the centre of a mass of delicate
elongated cells, either representing phloém or procambium. The middle cortex, b,
consists of a loose form of parenchyma, enclosing numerous irregular large lacune of
the type so common in the roots of the Nymphex. Of course, this indicates no
systematic relation with the latter plants, beyond the fact that our fossil root most
probably belonged to some aquatic or semi-aquatic type. At c is a compact quasi-
epidermal investing layer of cells. The specimen, which is from one of the Oldham
nodules, may be designated Rhizonium reticulatum.

Fig. 23 (Plate 8) is a somewhat larger rootlet, also with a lacunar cortex. A
strongly defined vascular cylinder, b, encloses a delicate medullary parenchyma a,
and is invested by a compact zone consisting of several cycloidally arranged rows of

* T was at first inclined to include these root-like objects in my provisional group of Rachiopteris ;
but, since they present few or no indications of being either rhizomes or petioles, I have determined to
utilise Corpa’s term Ihizonium for them. Corpa’s objects, to which he gave this generic name, he
appears to have regarded as being probably the roots of Orchidaceous plants ; but they are really undis-
