For 2<p<oo and dea< b the process Rg(s):= Sols —r)*S(s,r)gydW, belongs to
LP(0, T; LP(2; X)), which we identify with L? (2; L?(0,T; X)), and then use the fact that the mapping
Rah KG — s)*-!S(t,s)Ry(s) ds maps the latter space into L?(2; C([0, T]; X)). Mutatis mutandis this
method extends to the more general setting of 2-smooth Banach spaces. By bookkeeping the norm
estimates and tracking constants, and performing a standard localization argument, the following
result is obtained.

Theorem 4.5 (Factorization method). Let (S(t,s))o<s<r<r be a Co-evolution family on a
(2,D)-smooth Banach space X and let 2<q<oo. For all gEL(Q;L1(0, T; y(H,X))), the process
S S(t,s)g¢s dWs)te[o,r] has a continuous version. For g € Lh (2;L1(0, T; y(H, X))) with 0 <p <q, this
version satisfies
