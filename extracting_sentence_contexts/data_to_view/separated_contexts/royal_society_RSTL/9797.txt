5 The position of these bodies in the Mormyride has become quite reversed. Instead
ZZ of arching over the tori semicirculares on the dorsal ide of the brain as in the ordi-
S nary Teleostei, they become relegated to the inferior surface and occupy a position

S foundation. = The tecta appear to have attained this position in consequence of the enormous
S development of the wings alluded to in the first part of this paper. E Accompanying this change of position there is a considerable degradation of struc-
S ture.
