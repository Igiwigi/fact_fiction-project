} This triplet and the following are probably two terms of a series; in fact, their appearances in the

flame spectrum are identical. Moreover, the differences between the wave numbers (x) of the first two

lines of each of them are respectively 82 and 92, and between the wave numbers of the second and the
third lines, 112 and 114 respectively.

An inspection of the preceding tables will have shown that the lines in the spectra
produced under the conditions of my experiments are much more numerous than is
the case when the salt spray is not previously mixed with the gases which react to
form the flame, but is introduced in some other manner, In the latter case it does
