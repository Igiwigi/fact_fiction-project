light the former appears of a dark brown, and the cilia of a golden yellow colour.
Upon the most convex part of the body, which is not generally in the centre, but
leaning to one side, are set from three to five prominent transparent bosses surrounded
by a circle; and other circles are seen extending to the base of the body, the extreme
margin of which is bounded by a row of prominent tubercles. These marginal tubercles
are from thirty to forty in number, and from the cireumstance of the cilia arising from
them, it is probable that they are for the purpose of governing their motions, and
therefore analogous to the muscular lobes of Hydatina senta. No s8tructure, how-
ever, could be detected in these, nor in any other part of the body beyond a mere
granular parenchyma.

Fig. 22. Under this power the whole character of the ciliary motion is changed,
and it is seen that what before appeared to be a single cilium is in fact a wave of
cilia, and that their motion, instead of being in the direction of the circumference of
the disc, is at right angles to this. The ciliary phenomena are the most readily ob-
served when the gemmule is nearly at rest, or has become languid ; it then lies either
with the convex or the plane side uppermost, and with the cilia, which are of great
length, doubled in the middle upon themselves (fig. 21.), so that their extremities are
brought back nearly to touch the margin of the dise from which they arise. The
whole fringe of cilia is then snddenly unfolded, and after waving up and down with
a fanning motion they are either again folded up towards the under surface of the
body, or they commence their peculiar action. As the cilia have the appearance of
moving in waves round the disc (fig. 22.), each wave may be thus analysed. From a
