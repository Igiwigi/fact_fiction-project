2. Methods

(a) Experimental design and participants

This study was conducted in Nyangatom and Daasanach
Woredas (governmental units) of southwest Ethiopia. As
described in the introduction, Nyangatom and Daasanach are
small ethnic groups with strong identities, living primarily as
nomadic pastoralists and inhabiting largely ethnically hom-
ogenous regions. They have a long history of violent conflicts
with each other that primarily take the form of tit-for-tat raiding
[39,54]. Though they also have trading relationships occasionally,
they recognize each other as enemies; in fact, the Nyangatom
refer to Daasanach as ‘emoit’, literally meaning ‘enemy’. Ethio-
pian Highlanders are ethnically heterogeneous and do not
engage in intergroup conflict with either Daasanach or
Nyangatom.

Werecruited only adult male participants to best simulate real-
world between-group decision-making processes, where only
adult men are involved in intergroup conflict. In total, 192 males
participated in the experiment who belong to one of three natural
groups: Daasanach (N = 48), Nyangatom (N = 96) and Highlanders
(N =48). Our sample size lets us detect an effect size of w=0.23
with 80% power and 5% significance, calculated using G * Power
