Conversely, if x = x(-,x9) is a solution of (aCPy, ), then u := L,x is a solution of (aP1,). Hence, the problem (aP1,,) admits a unique mild solution if and only if (aCPy, ) does. As pointed
out in §3b, the latter is equivalent to the fact that N, generates a Co-semigroup on 0X. This
completes the proof. |

(b) The inhomogeneous case
Having characterized the well-posedness of the homogeneous problem with dynamic boundary
conditions we now study the inhomogeneous case

Au(t)=Amu(t)+f(), #20,

(Lu)(t) =Bu(t)+g(), #20, (iaP1,)

Lu(0) = x0
for f : Ry — X and g: Ry > dX. We call u: Ry > X a classical solution of (iaP1,) if Lu: Ry > 0X is
continuously differentiable in 0X, u(t) € D(Am) M D(B) for all t > 0 and (iaP1,) holds.
