z€ d{u > 0} Bi/2 we have an asymptotic development of the type u(x) © (x — z)+ - v, for some
directional vector v. The question one addresses is: How regular is the free boundary d{u > 0}
close to such points? Naturally, one needs to make this asymptotic behaviour more precise as =
well as to impose some a priori conditions on the free boundary, or the solution, in order to have :
a meaningful problem. In this note, we shall depart from Lipschitz free boundaries and derive
heuristically the C! regularity of the free boundary. nee)

We start by defining the notion of viscosity (or comparison) solutions!” for the free boundary
problem that we have in mind. As cavitation problems leads to jump in the gradient across the [4
free boundary, one has to start with a reasonable definition of the gradient on the boundary. This DNS
is done in the viscosity sense. [GB

Let us first remark two interesting facts about positive harmonic functions: :8

Let u>0 in D, and harmonic there, along with vanishing boundary values, locally near a boundary .
point 0D N B,(z).

(1) If D satisfies the interior ball conditions at z, i.e. By,(y) € D, and z € OBy,(y) 1 aD, then u has
asymptotically positive (possibly infinity) slope at z.

(2) If D satisfies the exterior ball conditions at z, i.e. By,(y) € D°, and z € 0B,,(y) N AD*, then u has
bounded Lipschitz norm (possibly zero) at z.

In the light of these properties/facts, one can define ‘forcefully’ a viscosity super- and sub-
solution as follows.
