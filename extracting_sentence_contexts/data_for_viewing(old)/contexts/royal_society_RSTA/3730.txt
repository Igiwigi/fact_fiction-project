to the lowest triplet minimum (31*), which shows a boat-like ring conformation (figure 3c) like
in uracil and thymine [53], is possible through the nearby T2/T; Coln. The energy of the Sz*
minimum, 2.9 eV, fits very well with the 3.0 eV onset of the phosphorescence spectrum of 5BU [9].
The ISC route in 5BU is reminiscent of the one found in U [21] and T [24], where also the !nox*
minimum is the gateway for population of the triplet manifold, due to the presence of the nearby
Si/Tz MXP and T/T; Coln (cf. figure 3b,f,¢). Also of interest is the observation that from the
lnox* minimum the system could easily cross back to the lix* state and subsequently deactivate
to the ground state, as was already proposed in the literature for U and T [51,54].

We note that the spin-orbit couplings in 5BU are not much stronger than in U or T, although
one might have expected this from the heavy-atom effect of the bromine atom. The relatively weak
spin-orbit couplings can be explained by the fact that neither the !noz* nor the 37* excitations
involve the bromine orbitals significantly. Owing to the properties of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian,

very large spin-orbit couplings could only be expected if the two involved states differ in one : =
orbital localized at the heavy bromine atom. For example, the coupling between the !1yo¢,, : S
and Snprogy, states amounts to 860cm~ at the Franck-Condon geometry. However, these strong : 2
interactions are only relevant at higher energies, but do not play a role after excitation to the S;. aed
Hence, in the low-energy range, ISC in 5BU should not be significantly different than ISC in U. 22

In figure 4c, the potential energy curves suggest that, in order to initiate photodissociation, the D4
system would need to switch from the bright !77* state to the dissociative !1o* state. At least :
in the shown scan, this involves a barrier of 0.2eV. Moreover, the barrier might become larger : Ss
after the molecule relaxes in the '17* state. In this regard, a transition-state search based on MS- :8
