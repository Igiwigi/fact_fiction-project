the degradation of OPVs. Indeed, this has been found to be the case with an important difference:
in OPVs, the exciton alone appears to drive molecular decomposition without involving a polaron
due to the unique chemical nature of fullerenes employed as acceptors in most high-efficiency
devices. The rate of loss in power conversion efficiency, which can be particularly rapid during
the early use (or ‘burn-in’) period of operation [9,10], can be fit to a model that is dependent solely
on the exciton density, in spite of the fact that the polaron density in efficient solar cells can even
exceed that in PHOLEDs under normal operating conditions [11].

This burn-in degradation for the case of an archetype subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)/Co
planar heterojunction cell shown in figure 4a exhibits a rapid decrease in PCE during the first 10h
of operation, after which the degradation saturates to approximately 70% of its initial value. It is
also seen in figure 4 that almost all the degradation in PCE is due to a decrease in short circuit
current density, which corresponds to a decrease in cell responsivity over time.

Models and experiments [11,13] have unambiguously attributed the OPV ageing process to
the formation of defects in the active region due to exciton-induced molecular decomposition,
analogous to the mechanism of Giebink et al. for PHOLEDs discussed above [3]. In fullerene-based
OPVs, however, the exciton itself promotes the formation of higher order oligomers [12] of Céo
