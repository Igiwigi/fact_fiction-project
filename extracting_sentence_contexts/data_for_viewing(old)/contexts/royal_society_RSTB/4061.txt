thus be needed. The alveolar oxygen pressure, as measured during the walking,
averaged 53°4 mm. Had the venous blood been absolutely free from oxygen, and had
the arterial blood been saturated to a pressure of only about 15 mm., the oxygen
might, therefore, have passed in by diffusion, since the required 45°3 mm. of mean
pressure difference would have existed. But arterial blood saturated to 15 mm. is
only 18 per cent. saturated with oxygen and is almost black in colour, while the colour
of the subject was absolutely normal. ‘There was also no sign, direct or indirect, of
want of oxygen in any part of the body, and the oxygen pressure in the venous blood
can hardly have been below 20 mm., or the arterial oxygen pressure below 60 mm.

It thus appears that, apart altogether from the evidence furnished by our deter-
minations of the actual arterial oxygen pressure, the diffusion theory entirely fails to
explain the facts observed on Pike’s Peak, and comes nowhere near explaining them,
unless, indeed, some adaptive change occurs by which the rate of diffusion is
enormously increased. Increase in the circulation rate, if it existed, would not help,
for such an increase would raise the oxygen pressure in the venous blood, and so
diminish the available diffusion pressure. ‘The same remark applies to increase in the
hzemoglobin percentage.

It is well known that men can live and work at higher altitudes than that of Pike’s
Peak. In his recent explorations in the Himalayas the Duc d’Abruzzi and his com-
panions climbed to 24,580 feet, the barometric pressure being 312mm. At this point
the explorers felt no discomfort during rest, and do not seem to have experienced any
difficulty in performing the work required in climbing. The oxygen pressure of the
inspired air, saturated at body temperature with moisture, was (312—47) x 29-8 = 55°4.
