The examples include bacterial turbulence [74,75] and
fish schooling in the ocean [76]. It was shown that there exists a trade-off between grouping
(clustering) and the optimizing of the energetic efficiency of individual locomotion for swimming
fishes [76]. The complexity of biological clusters arises from the fact that they are built from active
(self-propelling) matter (bacteria, nematodes, fishes, etc.). Even the pair interactions between self-
propelled swimmers become complicated, due to the fact that the pair dynamics depends on
the Reynolds number and time [73]. Moreover, the scaling arguments and the estimation of the
relevant dimensionless numbers (such as Re) become subtle.
