55'4—25'4 = 30°0 mm. Blood saturated with alveolar air at this pressure is very
dark in colour and not quite half saturated with oxygen, the percentage saturation
corresponding to what is found in the arterial blood of animals at the point of death
from asphyxia. On the diffusion theory the arterial blood would be at a considerably
lower saturation even during rest, and work such as that of cutting steps with an ice-
axe, or climbing, would apparently be wholly impossible.

The difficulties of the diffusion theory appear to become greater and greater as the
altitude increases; but in the absence of more definite physiological observations on
mountains at great altitudes we need hardly carry the argument into further detail.
Recent advances in knowledge as to the blood-gases and the physiology of respiration
seem, in fact, to have been altogether fatal to the simple diffusion theory hitherto
adopted by the majority of physiologists. The indirect evidence points as clearly to
this conclusion as the direct evidence furnished by our determinations of arterial
oxygen pressure on Pike’s Peak.

Prorocot of an Experiment on the Arterial Oxygen Tension and Blood Volume.
Pike’s Peak. July 20, 1911.

Subject, Doveias. Bar., 457 mm.

9.23-9.344 a.m. 301 c.c. of CO of 96°8 per cent. purity by analysis, at 14°5°, and under a pressure of
65 em. of water (= 179°5 ¢.c. dry, at 0° and 760 mm.) administered to subject, who
continued to breathe into the small apparatus till 9.38}.
