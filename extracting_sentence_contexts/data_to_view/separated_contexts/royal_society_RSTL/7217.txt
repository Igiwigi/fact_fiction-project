But if the rays which in the fore-
going experiments raised platinum and gold and silver to a red heat were wholly
extra-red, the rendering visible of the metallic films would be an instance of raised
refrangibility. And here I thought it desirable to make sure that no trace of the visible radiation
passed through the solution, and als that the invisible radiation was exclusively extra-red. This latter condition might seem to be unnecessary, because the calorific action of the
extra-violet rays is 80 exceedingly feeble (in fact 80 immeasurably small) that, even
supposing them to reach the platinum, their heating-power would be an utterly vanishing
quantity. Still mechanical considerations rendered the exclusion of all rays, of a higher
refrangibility than those generated at the focus, necessary to the rigid solution of the
problem. Hence, though the iodine employed in the foregoing experiments was suffi-
cient to cut off the light of the sun at noon, I wished to submit its opacity to a severer
test.
