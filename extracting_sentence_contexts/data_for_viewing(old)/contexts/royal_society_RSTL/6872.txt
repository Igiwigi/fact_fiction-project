* Among the products which Axpzrsox obtained by the action of nitric acid on narcotine, was one which
he supposed to be a hydrate of meconin, AxpzrsoN did not obtain a sufficient quantity of this substance to
enable him to ascertain its chemical relations; and we have already shown elsewhere (Proc, Roy. Soc. vol. xi.
P- 60) that his amalyses agree precisely with the formula of cotarnic acid, C,, Hy, Og: they also agree, though
not quite as well, with the composition of a hydrate of meconin =2(C,, Hy, ©,) Hz ©, but not at all with that
of the hydrate whose existence is 8upposed in the text.

THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF NARCOTINE. 365
u8ually considered characteristic of the aldehydes. In any case, however, the fact that
nascent hydrogen converts opianic acid into meconin, but has no action on hemipinic
acid, excludes the possibility of regarding the first of these bodies as a hemipinate of
meconin.

5. The action of hydrochloric and hydriodic acids on opianic acid and its congeners
proves that methyl is a constituent of each of them ; and since one molecule of hemi-
pinic acid yields two molecules of iodide of methyl when distilled with hydriodic acid,
we must assume the existence of two atoms of methyl in each molecule of meconin,
opianic acid, or hemipinic acid. It is useless to discuss the function of the methyl in
the firs: two of these substances before possessing more definite knowledge of their
chemical nature and of the bodies formed from them when the methyl is eliminated.
In the case of hemipinic acid, our knowledge on these points is already sufficient to
