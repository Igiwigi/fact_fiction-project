The facts of comparative anatomy, as may be seen from the work of ALLEN (‘Anat.
Record,’ vol. 2, 1908, p. 65, etc.), Favaro, Couz and others, suggest strongly that the
lymphatic system took its origin in lower Fishes by modification of vessels that at
first appearance formed a part of the blood-vascular system, and only later in more
highly organised forms became definitely set aside for the carriage of lymph alone.
This conclusion is, in fact, that come to by most who have studied the vascular system
in the adult.

An assumed close relationship between the lymphatic system in the early stages of its
evolution and the blood-vascular system rests, however, not only on the findings of
comparative anatomists, but is to some extent suggested by the facts of embryology.
It is, of course, notorious that embryologists differ profoundly in their interpretation. of
the appearances presented by the lymphatic vessels at their first differentiation, and
upon the question of the source and mode of development of the endothelium that
lines these early rudiments. According to one idea, due originally to Ranvier, but
associated now chiefly with the name of Saprn,* the lymphatics are direct outgrowths
of the veins ; their endothelium sprouts from the pre-existing endothelium of the veins
and their growth takes place centrifugally from the veins to the periphery.

In opposition to this view it is maintained by McCiurr, Huntincron and numerous
others, that the lymphatics arise, as at an earlier stage do the blood vessels, from

* Sanrn’s view of the question is given fully in Kersen and Matr’s ‘ Manual of Human Embryology,’
