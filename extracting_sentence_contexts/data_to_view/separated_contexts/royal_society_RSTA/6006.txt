Where
has the contribution of the field energy gone? Since it does not contribute to stress tensor, it
cannot have its effect in the force law, which is why Newton’s Law remains intact in GR. It
gravitates more subtly through curvature of 3-space, and is in fact sitting in the g,, component
of the Schwarzschild metric. Thus we could say Einstein is Newton with space curved [4]. It is the
curvature of space that comes into play only in non-radial motion, and it beautifully accounts for
the Mercury perihelion advance and also facilitates the so-called bending of light.”

Since gravitational field energy and vacuum energy share the same character and nature of
their origin—produced by matter as a secondary effect—and cannot exist of their own, vacuum
energy should likewise gravitate in the similar subtler way than by a stress tensor.
