Of special interest is the fact, which is disclosed by plotting 1/a against \?, that,
whatever the nature of this compound may be, it is sufficiently “ fixed” to give rise
to a rotatory dispersion which, in the case of five readings out of six, appears to obey
the “simple” law « = k/(\*—),*). In view of the importance of these observations
we made several attempts to repeat them, in order to test the validity of the “ simple ”
dispersion law by means of fresh data extending over a wider range and including a
larger number of wave-lengths ; but, up to the present, we have not succeeded in prepar-
ing solutions sufficiently clear to use for such a test.

-In quite a different category must be placed Bror’s observation that aluminium
tartrate, which is strongly dextrorotatory in dilute solutions, becomes levorotatory
when the solution is concentrated (‘Comptes Rendus,’ 1835, vol.
