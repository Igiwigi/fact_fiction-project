As the eggs found in the oviducts used in this investigation were not heavily
pigmented, no attempt has been made to locate the source of shell pigments.
GiersBerc believes that the pigment is conveyed by wandering cells, which penetrate

the uterine epithelium in the final stages of calcification. It must be mentioned,
however, that these pigments are well known as ooporphyrins derived from hemo-
globin. Turcnint (1924) has recorded the appearance of granules in the uterine
epithelium seen in frozen sections by oblique illumination, and he considers that
they are an instance of the previously recorded association of porphyrin-like
substances with tissues undergoing calcification. The facts that Turcutnr does not
appear to have distinguished his porphyrin granules from the shell matrix material,
which is readily stainable and insoluble, in the apical cells, and that he makes no
reference in his paper to the nature of the egg-shell pigmentation, which may be
present or absent in different breeds of fowls, appear to weaken his evidence that
the uterine epithelium secretes the calcium salts in the presence of a porphyrin.
I have examined frozen sections of uterus in oblique illumination but, in my opinion,
it is impossible to detect supposed porphyrin granules sufficiently clearly under such
conditions, to be certain of their chemical nature.

A discussion of the evidence associated with the secretion of the organic portions
of the egg-shell is confined almost entirely to a comparison between the work of
Fropose (1928) and my own observations, since he alone appears to have studied
