distributions correspond to the distributions for December—January—February
(DJF), March—April-May (MAM), June-July-August (JJA) and September
October-November (SON). In this study, the wet day was defined as the day with
daily precipitation greater than or equal to 1mm d7!. In addition, we compared
the monthly distributions and means of daily values of seven climatic variables
(12 tests for each climatic variable and each type of test, K-S or t-test). The
significance level was set to 1 per cent.

The null hypothesis was not rejected in most sites (i.e. the generated data
matched the observed ones; table 2). Thus, we here focus on the remaining
exceptional sites. In statistical hypothesis testing, the test could incorrectly reject
the null hypothesis with the probability equal to the significance level, even when
the null hypothesis is in fact true (known as a false positive; [3]). In figure 2, the
geographical distribution of sites with the significant differences is shown. There
were no significant differences in the K-S tests for the monthly distributions for
Tax, Tmin, SR, RH and WS. We calculated the percentages of tests indicating
a significant difference and summarized them in table 2. If we take the K-S
test result for Pr as an example, the percentage of tests indicating exactly one
significant difference is 2.5 per cent. Considering that 12 tests were performed for
each site, the percentage of tests indicating exactly one significant difference per
test is 0.2 per cent. This number is less than the expected false positive rate (1%)
and acceptable from the point of view of the significance level we set. Similar
results were found for the K-S test for RH and the ¢-test for Tmax, Tmin, Pr,
RH and WS (table 2). For these climatic variables, there were no biases in the
