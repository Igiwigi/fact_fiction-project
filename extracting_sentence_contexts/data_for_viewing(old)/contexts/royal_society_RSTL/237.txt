their size varying according to the quantity of water which
is necess8ary to keep up the pressure required.

The size of the ventricles would appear to be very imma-
terial, since even when they are increased 80 as to contain
above six ale pints, the functions of the brain are all carried
on, and the growth of the body proceeds ; but after the skull
is completely ossified, an increase of two or three ounces pro-
duces insensibility.

That the ventricles should admit of being increased to s0
great an extent, without any of the senses or faculties of the
brain being destroyed, is in itself a curious fact, and of s0
much importance with respect to the physiology of the brain,
that I shall detail the two following cases, which illustrate one
another,

In the one, the accumulation of water proceeded, as it will
appear, as far as it could go without materially impairing the
organ; it then stopt, and the boy grew up, with all his fa-
culties: in the other the water continued to increase, the sub-
stance of the cerebrum was absorbed, and the faculties of the
brain were destroyed.

A boy at a month old had $0 rapid an increase of the size
