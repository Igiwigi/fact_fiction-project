We publish in this issue papers dealing with the impact of managing genetically modified

the fact that these studies had a well-defined aim, namely to examine the effects of the
management of selected GM crops on specified species within distinct geographical confines
and time limits. Any conclusions drawn must acknowledge these limitations.

We are aware that, because the papers published here describe the results of government-
