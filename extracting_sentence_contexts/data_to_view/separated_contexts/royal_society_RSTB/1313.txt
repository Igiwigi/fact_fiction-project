Scuaupixn has recently published (31) a preliminary account of his researches
into the reproduction and mode of increase of the nuclei in the Foraminifera. This I
did not see until after my paper was written. Many of the observations appear to

Ge of the highest interest, but no mention is made of the important fact of the
gpxistence of dimorphism. Polystomella crispa (Luxn.) is described as usually having
Fe or four nuclei, but is said to become many-nucleated during reproduction ; a form
a reproduction is also described in which the whole of the protoplasm leaves the shell
Bod divides up into numbers of young individuals which assume the characteristic
Fhape of the species. ScHAUDINN has, however, apparently failed to recognise what
4 undoubtedly the fact, that in this species one in every thirty to forty individuals is
Shicrospheric and possesses nuclei of a quite different character from that of the
Bregalospheri ic form.
4 In his account of the changes which the nuclei of the Foraminifera undergo
“Breparatory to reproduction, ScHAUDINN describes a breaking up of the nucleus into
ae which are dispersed through the protoplasm; in this general result, my
Sbservations on the nucleus of the megalospheric form of Polystomella, so far as they
®. agree with his, but I am quite unable to recognise the remarkable phases of the
£r ocess which he describes in those that I have seen.
