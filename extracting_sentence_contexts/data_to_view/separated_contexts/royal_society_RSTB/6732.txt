Since this stage, though early,
is not the beginning of prophase, it is highly probable that the untwisting, which
certainly occurs in prophase, is confined to this stage. The essential feature of telophase
cannot therefore be the “uncoiling and repacking of the chromosome thread”’ as has
sometimes been thought (Darlington 1937, p. 34), since in Osmunda very little, if any,
uncoiling occurs till after rest. Another very important fact emerges from a measurement of the prophase chromo-
some figured (fig. 80, Plate 19). At this magnification ( x 2000) the length of the figured
specimen is 40 mm., as nearly as can be measured (see Appendix IV). Now if the
apparent diameter of a chromosome at metaphase or anaphase is measured, it is
possible to calculate the real length of the thread at these stages from the previous data
on the number of coils.
