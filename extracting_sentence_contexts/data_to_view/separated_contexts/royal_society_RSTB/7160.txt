This would not be the case unless full colour vision had been replaced
by reduced colour vision.

(26) Light and dark adaptation

Light adaptation was carried out by looking at the sky for several minutes; dark adapta-
tion, by screening the eyes completely from light. It was appreciated that complete light
and dark adaptation would not be achieved by such means. At the same time, if adaptation
had been a factor of importance in determining the substitution of reduced colour vision
for full colour vision, the tests which were undertaken should have disclosed the fact; such
was not the case, however. It is possible that the eye quickly readapts to the level of
illumination used for the tests, thus abolishing any effect that adaptation might otherwise
have had. In spite of these negative results, time was always allowed, during the experi-
ments described in this paper, for the observer’s eyes to adapt themselves completely to
the intensity of illumination of the test objects.

(27) The effect of light intensity
Preliminary experiments using an artificial pupil of 1-5 mm. diameter showed that light
intensity affects the visual angle at which yellow is replaced by white.
