trically the several n-th roots of unity, and each coefficient would be of the form g*F(9),
F a rational and integral function of 9g. It is moreoyer easy to see that, for the several co-
efficients A, B, C, g will denote the poxitive residue (mod. 8) of n, 21, 3n, . . . respectively. Hence assuming, as the fact is, that these coefficients are severally rational and integral
functions of g, it follows that the form is

9 having the foregoing values for the seyeral coefficients respectively. And it being
known that the modular equation is as regards u of the order =n+1, there is a known
limit to the number of terms in the several coefficients respectively. We haye thus for
each coefficient an identity of the form
