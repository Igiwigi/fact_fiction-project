Vaterite and
calcite were the most frequently met products of decomposition. Aragonite was formed on
one occasion by dropping the hexahydrate into boiling water although the usual product
after this treatment was vaterite. Discussion

From a chemical standpoint perhaps the most interesting results of the experiments which
have been described spring from the fact that by using suitable conditions it has been found
possible to promote the formation of metastable and unstable phases. By using a range of
conditions all the well-recognized crystalline products of the reaction of calcium chloride
and sodium carbonate have been prepared either as single phases or as mixtures, namely
calcite, aragonite, vaterite, and calcium carbonate hexahydrate, and in addition calcium
carbonate monohydrate and gaylussite. One of the important factors was the choice of
suitable additives.
