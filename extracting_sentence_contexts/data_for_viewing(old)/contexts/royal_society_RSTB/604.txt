replaced by amidogen, we must remember that this substance, viz., anilin, is capable

of being regarded from two points of view: (#) as amidobenzene, or benzene in which
one atom of hydrogen is replaced by amidogen, NH; or (b) as phenylamine, Â«.e.,
ammonia (NH,), in which one atom of hydrogen is replaced by phenyl (CSE):

Tn correspondence with this constitution we find that we may regard the symptoms
produced by it either as those (a) of benzene modified by amidogen, or (b) of ammonia
modified by benzene. Thus we find the symptoms differ from those of benzene and
resemble those produced by ammonia, in the tendency to more violent spasm and to
greater paralysis of muscle and nerve. They differ from those of ammonia in the fact
#hat.the convulsions never assume the form of true tetanus, the tetanic spasm which
pe ammonia group would produce being broken up, so to speak, by the action of the

enyl.

& As contrasted with the compounds already discussed, with exception of the
Bydroxyl compounds, it will be at once apparent that the accession of symptoms
froduced by the action of amidobenzene is decidedly more rapid. Within 5 to 7
Thinutes of subcutaneous administration a distinct muscular twitching with incoordi-
Sation of movement makes its appearance. The movements, whilst in the main
Burposeless and frequently confined to one side, have sometimes a regular speed of
Bcurrence, one form of motion being repeated again and again at short intervals.
