azimuths of 0* and 180* the restoration will be effected at an incidence of 80?,
while at azimuths of 90* and 2709? it will take place at an incidence of 70®, and
at intermediate azimuths it will take place at intermediate incidences. Hence
the ray of light reflected from steel, though it has the general properties of a
circularly polarized ray, differs from it in this remarkable particular, that it
requires different angles of incidence in different azimuths to restore the po-
larized light.

In circular polarization, as we have seen, the ray has the same properties in
all its sides ; and the angles of reflexion at which it is restored to polarized
light in different azimuths are all equal, like the radii of a circle described
round the ray. Hence, without any theoretical reference, the term circular
polarization is from this and other facts experimentally appropriate. In like
manner, without referring to the theoretical existence of elliptic vibrations pro-
duced by the interference of two rectilineal vibrations of unequal amplitudes,
we may give to the new phenomena the name of elliptic polarization, because
the angles of reflexion at which this kind of light is restored to polarized light
may be represented by the variable radius of an ellipse.

In circular polarization the restored ray has its plane of polarization always
inclined —45* to the plane of the second system of reflexions. In elliptic
polarization the difference is remarkable, The inclination of the plane of the
