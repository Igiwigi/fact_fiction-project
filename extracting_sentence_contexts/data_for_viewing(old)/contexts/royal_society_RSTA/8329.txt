we could establish (B) of (1.2) by a new method, reducing the discussion to the case
where all the p’s have one of two fixed values. We could even obtain a series estima-
tion of the “ error term ” R on the right of

by supposing the p’s altered in accordance with (1.3121) and (1.3122) so as to make
P (m,, mz) first a maximum, then a minimum, obtaining a series for R in these “ reduced ”
cases, and using the fact that in the general case it lies between these extreme values.
We shall not, however, go into this in the present paper.

1.32. The problem can thus be reduced to the case where all the p’s have one or
other of two fixed values. Suppose first that all the p’s are equal, and consider the
probability
