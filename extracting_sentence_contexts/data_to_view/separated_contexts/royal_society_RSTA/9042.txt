Greater
difficulty than usual was experienced in obtaining crystals free from serious striation
of the p {110} and c {001} faces, and a very large number of crops were grown, from
two entirely distinct preparations, before satisfactory small crystals were produced. The striation affects the values of the angles pp and cp particularly, rendering pp
(= 2ap) considerably too large, pp ( = 2bp) conversely too small to the same extent
(possibly as much as five minutes), and cp to a less degree (2’ or 3’) too large. This
fact. was established by measuring a number of crystals affected by the striation and
comparing the results with those derived from the perfect crystals used in the
measurements recorded in the table, which represent the true value of the angles. The unusual prevalence of such striation of the p and c faces is also responsible for the
more than usual discrepancy between the observed and calculated values of the angle
cr’, in cases like that of the salt under consideration, in which the 7’ faces were
perfect (yielding brilliant single images of the signal) and in which the ec faces, when
adjusted for the measurement of this orthozone, gave also indubitably placed images,
all the images of the bundle coalescing for this zone in the same vertical line. The faces of g {011} were usually relatively much smaller than those of the basal
pinakoid ¢ {001}, as shown in fig. 1, and the faces of ’{201} were usually also small,
although generally somewhat larger than the q faces.
