recently been explored with evolutionary models. One was
motivated by high mortality that intertidal limpets suffered
on days with high air temperatures, high solar radiation plus
low wind speeds [33]: a statistical model (‘environmental
bootstrap’) generated a time series with long periods of
benign conditions, punctuated with rare clusters of extreme
events. Next, heat-transfer models mapped environmental
variations onto body temperature and onto risk of heat stress,
which were used as input values for an allelic evolutionary
model. Simulations suggested that rare heat events will lead
to the evolution of upper lethal temperatures in limpets that
are 5—7°C above the average annual maximum temperature:
this ‘thermal safety margin’ in fact approximates that observed
for limpets.

A quantitative genetic model and an extension recently
explored impacts of extreme temperatures on overall thermal
sensitivity, not just extreme heat tolerance [31,34]: rare
extreme events (even only one every 20 years) shifted the
shape and position of thermal performance curves, especially
when extreme events cause death or persistent injury, or
when behavioural evasion and acclimation were blocked.
This model correctly predicted a shallow latitudinal gradient
in heat tolerance of Drosophila from eastern Australia, even
though mean temperature varies substantially with latitude.
