5 Vertical section of the left ventricular wall (Mammal).

S On making a vertical section of the left ventricle between the musculi papillares
(Plate XIE. figs. 13 & 14), the ventricular wall (s), like the ventricular cavity, is observed
Sto form a double cone, the apices of which point towards the apex and base of the yen-
Ztride respectively, the bases, which are united in the upper portion of the middle third,
Seonesponding with the thickest part of the ventricular wall. The varying degree of
ickness in the ventricular wall is traceable to the fact, that the outermost and inner-
:2most layers extend further towards the apex and base than those which come next, and
Sthexe, again, further than those which succeed them, and s0 on until the central layer is
Freachedâ€”this being of least extent, and confined indeed to about the middle third of
Sthe ventricle. 'Thus into the apicial portion of the ventricular wall, where thinnest, only
Zone layer enters, viz. the superficial or first external*. Into a second portion, a little
Zabove the apex, two layers enter, the first and the seventh ; into a third or higher portion
four, viz. the first and the seventh, the second and the sixth ; while into a fourth, or still
Shigher portion, which corresponds with the upper part of the middle third, the whole
Szeven layers enter. Tracing the thickness of the ventricular wall in an opposite direc-
Stion, 5. 6. from the base towards the upper part of the middle third, the same changes
Qpresent themselves, although in a less marked degree. Thus the extreme base consists
of two layers, the continuations in fact of those forming the second part of the apex;
