decalcified, Such sections were ground fairly thin, then subjected to the prolonged
action of a weak gold chloride solution, and reduced in the same manner as the
decalcified preparations. They were then ground as thin as possible on a stone with
water.

Owing to the very numerous branchings of the tubes in this situation, and the fact
that these in many places take a diffuse brown stain from the gold treatment, the
nerve fibres are a good deal obscured, but in places they are very evident, and are
seen to terminate in fine arborisations (Plate 49, fig. 9).

Here and there they pass for a short distance into the enamel, apparently in the
interprismatic spaces, where they terminate in small bulbous enlargements.

Where the so-called “spindles” are present in the enamel, especially at the apices”
of the cusps, fine winding fibres are sometimes seen within them, but these spindles
do not in my preparations appear to contain definite nerve-end organs as described by
Romer (4). It is impossible, however, to speak with certainty on this point, and the
spindles being comparatively infrequent, a great many teeth should be prepared in
