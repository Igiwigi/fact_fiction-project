Since the preceding experiments were made, I have farther
proved the efficacy of this substance by actual practice, and
have converted skin into leather by means of materials which,
to professional men, must appear extraordinary, such as, deal
saw-dust, asphaltum, common turpentine, pit-coal, wax candle,
and a piece of the same sort of skin.

Allowing, therefore, that the production of this substance
must for the present be principally regarded only as a curious
chemical fact not altogether unimportant, yet as the principle
on which it is founded appears to be developed, we may hope,
that a more economical process will be -discovered, s0- that
every tanner may be enabled to prepare his leather even from
the refuse of his present materials.

The organized bodies and their products have only of late
years much attracted the attention of chemists, many of whom,
even at this time, (although the modes of chemical examina-
tion have been 80 much improved,) seem | disgusted' and
deterred by the Proteus-like changes which take place when-
ever these substances are subjected to experiment.
