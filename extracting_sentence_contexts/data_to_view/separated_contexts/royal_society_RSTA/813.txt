For a given value of hy +h, the optimum arrangement, if practical, is to make hy, = hp. It is here that the importance of the fictitious radius |r, | comes in. With both the
transmitter and receiver elevated it is necessary for the line joining them to clear the
fictitious sphere of radius | r, |, if the signals are to be unobstructed by the intervening
earth. This means, for instance, that on 10 m. the line joining them must clear the
surface of the earth by about 225 m., as will be seen from (5-15). The absolute values of signal strength at the surface of the earth are dealt with
in the next section, but assuming for the moment the results there obtained, the height-
gain analysis can be used to prepare a set of graphs for various wave-lengths, giving
the signal strength for 1 kW. radiated, against distance from the transmitter for various
heights of the receiver above the ground.
