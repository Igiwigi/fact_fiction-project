where P,, is the product of symmetric groups of degrees «,, %, ... %)
respectively ; P indicates that the sum of all the 7! permutations of the n ne
are to be a S,, represents the operation of moving one letter from the s‘* row
of the tableau up to the 7 row, and the resulting term is taken to be zero when
any row becomes less than a row below it or when letters from the same row overlap.
In fact, when cycles of degree r are replaced by the symbol s, this equation becomes

which gives the result stated, provided the restriction as to zero terms is observed.
It will be noticed that the suffix of the element ®,.,-, in the determinant may
become zero or negative. In the former case the value of the element is unity, and
in the latter case it is zero.
