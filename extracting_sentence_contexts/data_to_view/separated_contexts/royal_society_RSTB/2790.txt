Comparing the results of our inquiry for Vascular Plants with those from
Bryophyta, we find in both evidence of sterilisation, with, conversely, occasional
reversion of cells normally sterile to spore-production. So that putting together the
converse conclusions, and remembering at the same time the fact that in some cases
the sporogenous groups are very ill-defined, i¢ may be stated generally for the sporophyte
of Archegoniate plants, that spore-production is not in all cases strictly limited to,
or defined by pre-ordained formative cells, or cell-groups. This position, based as
it is on the facts observed, is one which harmonises readily with a theory of sterilisation,
as applied to the evolution of the sporophyte. VorcuttxG has formulated the proposition that “no living vegetative cell of the
plant-body, which is capable of growth, has a specific and unalterable function.”+
This thesis in its most general sense should be extended so as to include also
sporogenous cells ; for, as we have seen, many cases can be cited of the conversion of
cells which are sporogenous to a vegetative condition, and occasionally the converse. But both VorcurinG, and Prerrer.{ in discussing this equipotentiality of embryonic
cells, and the influences which determine their development, have restricted - the
discussion chiefly to the vegetative organs.
