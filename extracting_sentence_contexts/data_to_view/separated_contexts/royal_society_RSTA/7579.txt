It is seen that the two solutions differ, and it may be asked which of them is correct. The answer is that both are correct but they correspond to different conditions of the
problem. In fact, the question “ what is the probability of a chord having its length
larger than B ” does not specify the problem entirely. This is only determined when
we define the measure appropriate to the set (A) and its subsets to be considered. We may describe this also differently, using the terms “random experiments ” and
“ their results’’.
