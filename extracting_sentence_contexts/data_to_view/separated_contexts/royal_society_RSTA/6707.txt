The constants Q and A are to be determined from the condition that the applied
load is

w= — | rb dre, (7)*
and has a moment about the origin given by

fas [[-@2-2.70) drdz. We observe that in virtue of (18)
46=0 and YW —=—2(Q—Az) (20)

when stands for the quantity within curly brackets in the last of (19) ; also that when
the boundary is symmetrical about the axis Or (as will be the fact in most problems
having practical interest) solutions in which both of ¢ and are respectively even and
odd in z correspond with the independent constants Q and A. Then (for symmetrical
loading) the Q-solution contributes to W but not to N, the 4-solution to N but not to W. Section II.
