lusia mammillata, Ascidiella aspersa, Styelopsis grossularia, Polycarpa rustica ; in small
numbers only—Ciona intestinalis, Ascidiella scabra, Ascidia conchilega, Ascidia mentula,
Ascidia virginea, Molgula ampulloides and Polycarpa fibrosa. (A. mentula, A. con-
chilega and A. scabra are to be obtained much more readily at Roscoff, Brittany).
Boltenia hirsuta, Tethyum pyriforme americanum, Ascidia prunum, Molgula citrina and
M. retortiformis were easily obtained in shallow water at St. Andrew's, Styela partita
at Woods Hole. The principal difficulty in obtaining successful cultures was due to
temperature. At Plymouth, Roscoff and Woods Hole, the sea and laboratory tem-
peratures are much the same, and at both places fertilisation and normal development
can be obtained for all the species mentioned between 8 and 20° ©. at least. At St.
Andrew’s, however, the temperature of the sea bottom is far below that of the laboratory
and successful cultures were only obtained when maintained throughout at temperatures
below 11-12°C. This fact probably accounts for the failure encountered at the Marine

Laboratories at Trondhjem and Kristineberg where similar temperature differences
obtain. At the latter station the salinity of the water has also to be considered.

The temperature curve given is merely as a rough indication of the time taken from
fertilisation to hatching for species with eggs approximately 0-15 mm. diameter ;
