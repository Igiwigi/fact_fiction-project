Worker-like forms are of irregular occurrence-â€”the majority of the colonies were
without examples which could unhesitatingly be referred to that category. One
colony near Bhowali (Kumaon Himalaya) contained, however, over forty specimens of
these forms, and another contained about thirty. In both instances they were found
during May and June, and possibly their appearance may,- to some extent, be
seasonal, The great development of the gonads in the examples dissected, and the
fact that one worker-like form laid eggs in captivity, indicates that they are also
gynzcoid forms. True neoteinie queens or kings were not found, although they are
known to oceur in Termopsis angusticollis. It is not unlikely that it may fall to
future observers to discover them, but the possibility of the gynzcoid worker-like
forms subserving the same function should not be overlooked.
