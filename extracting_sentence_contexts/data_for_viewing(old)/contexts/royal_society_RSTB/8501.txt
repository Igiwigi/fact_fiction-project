Feachem ef al. [34] identified 131 attempted elimination pro-
grammes and classified them as ‘under way’, ‘successful’ or
‘unsuccessful’. Excluding the 32 countries where elimination
was categorized as under way leaves 50 successful and 49 unsuc-
cessful programmes. A recent systematic review documented
75 episodes of resurgent malaria in 61 countries [35] and can
be used to examine the sustainability of these programmes. Of
the 49 elimination programmes that failed to achieve elimin-
ation, resurgence events were identified in 36 (73%) of these
countries. The causes of resurgence were poorly documented,
but most frequently resurgence was blamed on the failure to sus-
tain high intervention coverage levels. Resurgence is, in fact, the
outcome generally predicted by the Ross—Macdonald theory of
elimination, since the vector populations are expected to have
retained their capacity to transmit malaria parasites. The fact
that a majority of programmes saw eventual resurgence is,
therefore, unsurprising within this conceptual framework.
