115, It will be noticed that the pairs of theta-functions which present themselves
in these equations are the same as in the foregoing * Table of the 120 pairs.” And
the equations show that the four products, each of a pair of theta-functions, belonging
to the upper half or to the lower half of any column of the table, are 8uch that any
three of the four products are connected by a linear equation. The coefficients of
these linear relations are, in fact, functions snch as the a? +8, a?—8&, 248 written down
at the foot of the several systems of eight equations, and they are consequently products
each of two zero-functions c.

Thus (see © The first set, 24 equations ”) we have
