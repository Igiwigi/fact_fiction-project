An analytical solution is available for coaxial, filamentary circular loops and a parallel infinite
slab. Starting from the solution for two single loops, one at (r,z) =(a,d) carrying the current I
and the other one at (r,z) =(R, —Z) penetrated by the flux @, the basic solution is M= /I=
2nR - Ayy(R, —Z)/I, with

and the first-order Bessel function J; and k’ = (k* + iwpo)'/7, w = 2xf [16]. Considering that each coil consists of several loops (turns) in series (i=1,2,...,N3 for
the calibration coil and j=1,2,...,Nz, k=1,2 for the detection coils), we have the following
expression:

The frequency dependence of M;(f) is evaluated to determine the electrical conductivity
o =ox of the slab (see §4c) using the fact that o enters Mx(f) only in the form fo. We perform
a fit (preferably simultaneously to both real and imaginary parts) of the normalized function

The influence of the superconducting shield is estimated by comparing the results for Mj in the
infinite space with those obtained in a superconducting sphere, Mx, which has the same radius as
the superconducting cylinder.
