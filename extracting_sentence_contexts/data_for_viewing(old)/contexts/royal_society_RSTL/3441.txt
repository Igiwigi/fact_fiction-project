has been devoted to the former, and Plate XXIII. to the latter object. In the upper
row of figures of Plate XXIV. I have copied the only delineations published by others
of ova from the Fallopian tube. The amount of information obtainable from these,
will be seen on comparing with them eleven states of ova from the Fallopian tube,

upon the discoveries of ScaLEextFÞ in the vegetable kingdom, had demonstrated
that in development the same phenomena are exhibited in both ; that he had shown
animal tissues in general, like those of plants, to be reducible to modifications of vesi-
