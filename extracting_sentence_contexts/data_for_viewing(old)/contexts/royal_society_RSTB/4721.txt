Apart from other arguments for interference, the existence of the periodic structure
described on p. 35 et seq., is strong prima facie evidence that, in certain insects at
least, this structure is the main cause of iridescence; and the evidence would be
strengthened if it could be shown that the plates are of the correct magnitude. The
first difficulty that requires to be dealt with is that the structure is at right angles, and
not parallel, to the wing-surface (fig. 2, p. 36). If the plates are at right angles to the
scale, and therefore approximately at right angles to the wing-surface when the
latter is normal to the line of vision, the plates must be near grazing incidence, and
vice versd. When, therefore, the wing is turned from the normal through an
increasing angle, the plates will change from grazing incidence to the normal, but
the colour will not change towards the violet or shorter wave-length, as has always
been aftirmed,} but towards the red, because the path of light within the plates is
becoming longer, If it can be shown that as a matter of fact the colours do change

+ For instance, MICHELSON, A. A., loc, cif. (see p. 3), says that in birds and insects “the change of
colour with changing incidence strictly follows the law already mentioned—the colour always changing
towards the blue end of the spectrum as the incidence increases.” Watrer, however (loc. cit., see p. 2),
the only physicist who has carefully observed a large number of insects, states that there are exceptions
to the general rule, ¢.g., Papilio epiphorbas Boisp., which turns from blue to green at grazing incidence.
But he has attributed this anomaly to the fact that “the scales are only coloured slightly and are so
raised that at grazing incidence the body-colours are seen, whereby the displacement of the colour
becomes quite abnormal,” (See BANcrort, W., ‘J. phys. Chem.,’ vol. 23, p. 448 (October, 1919).)
