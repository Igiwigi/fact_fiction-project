NEWTONIAN CONSTANT OF GRAVITATION. 33

of the mirror of ‘7”, and of the balls of zspj65 inch. To this degree of accuracy
there is no difficulty in observing; in fact, I might have made the divisions smaller,
and still have been able to read to tenths. Of course this perfection is only possible
with a very perfect mirror, and for this I applied to Mr. Hmcer, who took special
pains in preparing several as thin as he dare. Of these, one only, when tested while
still round with the large astronomical telescope upon an artificial star, was perfect
in its definition, and formed the spurious disc and diffraction rings equally in all
directions.
