There is much, therefore, to be aid in favour of G6Trr's view. At the same time,
there is another possible interpretation of the facts which would admit the homology
of the ribs as well as of the hzmal arches throughout the Pisces.

Let us suppose, to start with, that the primitive arrangement of the parts is more or
less nearly that found in Lepidosteus, where we have well-developed ribs in the region
of the trunk, girthing the body-cavity, and uniting in the candal region to form the
ventral parts of the hamal arches. It is easy to conceive that the ribs m the trunk
might somewhat alter their position by passing into the muscles, along the inter-
muscular s8epta, till they come to lie between the dorso-lateral and ventro-lateral
muscles, as in Elasmobranchii. Lepidosteus itself affords a proof that such a change
