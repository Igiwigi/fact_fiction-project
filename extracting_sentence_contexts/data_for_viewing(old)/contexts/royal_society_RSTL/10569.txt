Z The division of the table relating to the Miscellanez shows that under the condi-
E tions of luxuriant growth of the grasses on this plot, only three species of the
= miscellaneous group come under the category of those yielding more than one per
L cent. to the total herbage in any one of the separation-years. These ure, in the order
S of their average prevalence, Rumer Acetost, Conopodium denudatum, and Achillea
S Millefolium. Each of these varied considerably in amount from year to year according
= to the character of the season ; but each of the three gave by far the most in the
8econd separation-year, which, it will be remembered, was extremely favourable for
Miscellanez generally ; indeed, in that year the quantity both of Jtumez and of
Conopodium was extremely large. Tn each of the other years the Rumen gave more
than the other two together. In fact, it is obvious that the conditions were, notwith-
standing the severe competition of the free-growing grasses, very specially fayourable
for this vigorous, free-seeding, and objectionable weed.
In actual yield, each of these three most prominent of the miscellaneous species gave
much more, on the average, than without manure, especially the /umex ; but of the
numerous species, taken collectively, none of which have yielded one per cent. to the

total herbage, there was much less growing on this plot of great Inxuriance of grazses
than without manure. Compared with the yield of the three prominent species by
ammonia-salts alone, the mixture gave considerably more, especially of Conopodium
