The form and internal state of the blood-corpuscle found in the adult of certain
animals, very much resembles that existing only in the feetal life of others. This will
be obvious on an inspection of the drawings. That such resemblance is referable to
uniformity in the mode of evolution, results from our whole experience on the re-
production of cells, as I explain it, and from facts above mentioned, showing that
blood-corpuscles are generated by a like process; the difference between the condi-
tion of these objects in the embryo and in the adult of the same animal, being appa-
rently referable to a difference in the degree of their development as cells.

70. An incidental observation may perhaps be mentioned here. 'The brain in the
embryo of the Ox, at certain periods, appears to consist almost entirely of objects
such as those in figs. 59 and 60; which, it will be seen, are composed of discs. Before the addition of acetic acid, such objects in many instances are surrounded by
a halo, which seems to represent the membrane of a minute cell.
