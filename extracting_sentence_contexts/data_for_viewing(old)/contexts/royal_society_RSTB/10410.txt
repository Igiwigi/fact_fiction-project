superorganism requires crossing the so-called eusociality
threshold, which involves overlapped generations, division
of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive subsets
and the maintenance of genetic relatedness [178,179]. Interest-
ingly, Oster & Wilson [179] explicitly mention the potential
relevance of phase transitions in understanding the organiz-
ation of castes in social insects. What about the synthetic
counterparts? Is it possible to evolve or engineer synthetic
swarms? It has been pointed out that one precondition for
the origin of societies of insects was a ‘get together’ rule that
should operate after individuals are born. This is a key require-
ment in order to achieve a cohesive group. However, less
importance has been given to the fact that, when such a step
has been achieved, group responses resulting from phase tran-
sitions emerge too [18,180—182]. Here also, interactions among
individuals can trigger system-level responses provided that
critical thresholds are reached [18,181,183].

These transitions provide the group-level dynamics
required to perform different types of tasks. A specially rele-
vant example in our context is provided by an experiment
that combined mixed societies of artificial and natural
agents [184,185] including both real and robotic cockroaches
(figure 14) that have to perform a two-choice decision between
two shelters. The robots were shown to modulate the collective
