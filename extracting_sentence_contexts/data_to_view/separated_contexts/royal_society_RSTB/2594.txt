Bourne and Fowter have suggested that the “edge-zone” in some of the
perforate types may be in a retrograde condition. This may be the case in some
Eupsammids, but fossil evidence is, it seems to me, in favour of the ccenenchyme in
the Madreporide, &c., being a distended form of wall from the first; there is no
fossil evidence to show that it may have developed as an extended visceral chamber. It is worth repeating here the familiar fact that costee are present in these types
which have no necessary relation to the septa of the peristome. Moreover, the dis-
continuity of the septa and costee (even when placed opposite each other) is one of
the most characteristic features of coomenchymes in the “ perforates.” Generally
speaking, it may be said that the distribution of costs on ccenenchyme depends on
the particular position of the folds of coonosarcal flesh around the polyps, and differs
considerably in different members of one and the same colony.
