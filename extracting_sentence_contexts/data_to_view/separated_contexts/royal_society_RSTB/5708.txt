For in three of these experiments it developed into a complete leaf, with well-
formed stipules, though two of these leaves were of less than normal size, and in a
fourth experiment also it developed into a leaf with stipules, though the stipules were
very small, even relatively to the central part of the leaf, which was itself small. In
the fifth experiment it developed without any stipules. Since it was evident that in
four of these five isolations, just as in those of P,, the cuts were accidentally slightly
oblique, these facts indicate that I,, when deprived of half or more of its stipular areas,
can re-organise itself so as to form complete stipules at the expense of tissue that would
otherwise have gone to form the central part of the leaf. Thus, to use a convenient
term, a secondary determination of the material of the primordium into central part
and stipules has taken place at the stage of P,, but not, or not irrevocably, at that of I,. In the isolations, whether of I, or P,, in which less than half of the stipular areas was
left on the apex, the isolated primordium always developed into a complete leaf possessing
both stipules.
