The details
of the application of the method are flexible ; the method itself appears to the author to
remain valid. The advantage of the method of maxima is that it avoids any appeal to
a knowledge of the exact formula for the atomic scattering coefficient. In fact if the
chemical composition factors ¢ could be assumed known, the atomic scattering coeflicients
could themselves be determined from observed line-contours. Probably a complete
knowledge of all line-contours in a sufficient number of stars of known T and g would
provide more equations than unknowns—the unknowns being the <’s and the atomic
s,s. After that the method could be applied to determine g for stars of known T but
unknown g.

An important need at the moment is a mathematical treatment of the effect of selective
radiation-pressure in the transition region—the reversing layer.
