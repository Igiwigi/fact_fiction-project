like the latter, is composed of cells devoid of blue-staining inclusions and possessing
slender, darkly-staining nuclei. These nuclei resemble those of the cells of the lateral
ciliated tract in their dense granulation and in the very small size of the nucleoli,
but appear to stain a little less darkly than do the latter. Irregular inclusions are
sometimes seen in these cells, but it has not been possible to determine their
nature.

The right wall of the anterior half of the mid-gut (fig. 4) calls for little comment.
There is no specialized ciliation corresponding to the lateral ciliated tract, but there
can be detected on the wall a gentle backward and upward current (v.) leading away
from the right wall of the diverticulum, the current finally ending by diffusing
indefinitely over the wall. The path of this current, like that of the current w on the
opposite wall (fig. 2), is not defined structurally apart from the fact that the wall
here is somewhat lighter than elsewhere, nor is it composed of the cells with dark
nuclei. Immediately anterior to it a dark band is prominent (fig. 4, 7.), and this may
be regarded as marking the boundary on this side between the mid-gut and the
oesophagus. Farther backwards the secretory cells soon extend upwards (fig. 9, sec.),
and towards the hind end of the anterior half of the mid-gut (fig. 10) the disposition

of the cells becomes more or less symmetrical, nearly the whole of the wall being
secretory. It is clear, however, that most of the anterior half is extremely asymmetrical
in its minute structure.
