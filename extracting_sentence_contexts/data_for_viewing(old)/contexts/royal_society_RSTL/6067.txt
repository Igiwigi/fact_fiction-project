Stake No. 1 was fixed in the ice, close to the eastern side of the glacier, and the
retarding influence of this side is quite manifest from the measurements. A glance.
however, reveals a fact confirmative of the former measurements ; the daily motion of
the extreme eastern stake is 144 inches behind the maximum, while the motion of the
extreme western stake is 254 inches behind it. The stake No. 5, which moved at the
maximum rate, was also much nearer to the eastern than to the western side of the ice-
Stream ; the observation therefore corroborates those already made as regards the position

af the point of maximum motion.
8 How then is the fact to be accounted for, that the point of maximum motion of the
er de Glace is thus thrown towards its eastern boundary ? Reflection suggested to me
hat the effect might be due to the curvature of the valley through which the Mer de
lace moves. At the place where the foregoing observations were made the glacier

Df Professor ForBEs and M. AGass1z; but let us make a bolder application of the ana-
Sgy than any of them contemplated, confining our view to the influence of curyature

Fowards which the river turns its convex curvature. Can this be the case with the ice !
At 80, the place of maximum motion ought to be different where the glacier bends in the
