that the loss by vertical transmission is sometimes as low as eighteen per cent.,
and seldom higher than twenty-five per cent. when the sky appears pure.

Secrron IN.â€”On the Mass of Atmospheric Air traversed by rays with varying obli-
quities.

24. It follows, from the simplest geometrical consi-
derations, that if the strata of air be ranged concentri-
cally, and if the thickness of the atmosphere A D be
small compared to the radius of the globe C A, the
length of path A B of the rays of light will vary nearly
as the secant of the zenith distance, except near the ho-
rizon. It is, of course, supposed (which is the fact) that
the curyature of the path AB is s0 inconsiderable as not
materially to affect its length. Within the limits between which the above approxi-
mation may be accepted as correct (that is, for altitudes above 15* for most pur-
Poses), it is plain that the law of densities at different heights is left out of account ;
for the hypothesis amounts to considering the strata as flat, and therefore as all cut
by the ray at the same angle.

25, Near the horizon, however, this law can give no approximation, for there the
Secant would give an infinite thickness traversed, whilst the curvature of the globe
and atmosphere limits the path to the length of the line A H. If we would, there-
fore, ascertain the length of path, we must ascertain the length of A H; and 80
