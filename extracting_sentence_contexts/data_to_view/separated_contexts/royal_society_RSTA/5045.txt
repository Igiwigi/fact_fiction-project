human and we all still like a hero since it makes for a good story. But it may not make for a
good history. In closing, I would go further in proposing that the history of the discovery of the periodic

than the fact that it involved at least six individuals by contrast to the more frequently cited cases
involving two or three individuals such as Newton and Leibniz, Darwin and Wallace, Weinberg
and Salam, Venter and Collins to cite just a few. References
