&. direction, or the plane through the centre of reciprocation. For the vector oq of
equation (B) becomes infinitely long if Sg = 0, and the plane S/q = 0 passes through
— the scalar point if 82=0. We may also observe that the difference of two unit
= points A —B is the vector from one point B to the other a, and this again is in
6 agreement with the opening sections of the “ Lectures.”

The only other symbols peculiar to this method are the symbols for quaternion
8 arrays. The five functions (ab), [ab], [abe], (abe), and (abed) are particular cases of
3 arrays, being, in fact, arrays of one row. In general the array of m rows and 2

g may be defined as a function of mn quaternion constituents, which vanishes if, and
A only if, the groups of the constituents composing the rows were connected by linear

relations with the same set of scalar multipliers. In other words, the array vanishes
