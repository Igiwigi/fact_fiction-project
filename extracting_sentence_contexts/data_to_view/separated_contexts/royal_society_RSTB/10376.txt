In one recently developed exper-
imental paradigm, participants learn a variable miniature
language (either allowing multiple means of marking number
or exhibiting meaningless variation in word order) and
then use it to communicate ([33—35]; see also [36-38] for exper-
imental studies looking at the role of alignment in driving
convergence in graphical communication, and [39] for a


review of relevant modelling work). This work finds that reci-
procal priming during interaction leads to convergence within
pairs of participants, typically on a system lacking unpredict-
able variation. Intriguingly, there is also increased regularity
in participants who thought they were interacting with another
human participant, but were in fact interacting with a computer
that used the variants in their trained proportion and was not
primed by the participants’ productions [34]. Regularization
here cannot be due to priming (as priming of the participant
by the computer interlocutor should keep them highly vari-
able), nor can it be due to reciprocal priming (as the computer
is not primed by the participant); it must therefore reflect an
(intentional or unintentional) strategic reduction in unpredict-
able variation promoted by the communicative context,
consistent with the data from Perfors [16]. There are, however,
subtle differences between the kind of regularization we
see in this pseudo-interaction and the regularization we see in
genuine interaction.
