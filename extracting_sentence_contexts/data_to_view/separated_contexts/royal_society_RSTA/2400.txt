The analysis
in [39] goes beyond those periodic solutions and establishes a theory of the dynamics of a
slowly oscillating chaotic solution, which is called laminar chaos and is found only in systems
with dissipative delay. These solutions are fundamentally different from the slowly oscillating
solutions, which are known for constant delay systems. In fact, they are a result of the Doppler
effect with self-feedback due to a time-varying dissipative delay. In the following, we present a
systematic analysis of the dynamics due to dissipative delays for the nonlinear DDE (3.1). It opens
a rich variety of periodic and chaotic dynamics, which may be interesting for applications.
