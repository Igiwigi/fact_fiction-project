differences can be of a quantitative or of a qualitative nature. As models will always differ from
reality—by design as well as necessity—lack of robustness of a model’s predictions should temper
our trust in a model as a description of reality.

We will explore facets of the robustness of the TP mechanism, and for this we first discuss
the mathematical hallmarks of TP mechanisms. We then provide a brief overview of how
experimental studies of TPs reflect these basic principles. Having established the existence of TPs
in nature, we then provide perspectives on robustness. After discussing TPs and TP-generating
mechanisms from these perspectives, we revisit the competing mechanisms of TPs and PI and
argue that this dichotomy has in the past been overblown. Both mechanisms have their place and
roles to fill in developmental biology; often, indeed, they may be required simultaneously [8].
Furthermore, at a deeper mathematical level we can also show that mathematical models of these
two mechanisms are in fact closely related.

2. Turing-pattern mechanism

Turing’s original mechanism involves two morphogens, A and B, which act as illustrated in
figure 1a: local activation (of A by itself, and of B by A via diffusion), followed by lateral inhibition
(of A by B, again via diffusion).
