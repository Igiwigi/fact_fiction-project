in the case of vertical force (the vertical force variations for Pavlovsk are so small in
amplitude that but little reliance can be placed upon the phase angles).

As regards the amplitudes, the second harmonic is generally the greatest, though
the first harmonic (which is usually the next greatest) sometimes equals or even
exceeds it. The fourth harmonic is generally the smallest of all, often being quite
inappreciable. The first three harmonics are as a rule much greater in summer than
in the other seasons, the winter values usually being the smallest. A remarkable
feature, however, brought out by Table VIA. is that the fourth harmonic is always
greatest at the equinoxes, both absolutely and (@ fortior?) in proportion to the other
components ; this is shown even in the case of Pavlovsk vertical force. The equinoctial
amplitude is frequently one-third that of the second harmonic, and sometimes
greater. As I have previously shown (ยง 25, p. 306, loc. cit.), the fact that the
fourth harmonic is appreciable at all indicates that the diurnal variation in the
atmospheric electrical conductivity cannot be represented by a simple diurnal wave
a+b cost, but that terms of higher frequency in the solar day must be present.
The occurrence of these large values of C, at the equinoxes should therefore have an
interesting physical bearing ; as yet, however, I have not entered into these theoretical
questions, pending the acquisition of data from further observatories, and also the
completion of an extension, by improved methods, of the mathematical theory of my
former paper, both of which are now in hand.

In conclusion it isa pleasure to acknowledge the assistance which has been placed at
my disposal in carrying out the computations of this paper by the Government Grant
Committee of the Royal Society, by the Astronomer Royal, and by Dr. ScHustER.
