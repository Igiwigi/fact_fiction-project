I divide y into 10 or 12 equal parts—say 10 for brevity—and let 6 = yoy. I then compute eleven equidistant values of the subject of integration, say 1%, wm,
«++ Uo, Corresponding to y = 0, 28, 38, ...108. As a fact it is unnecessary to compute
the first four of these, because they are practically zero. The equidistant values increase so rapidly that they are very inappropriate for the
application of the rules of numerical quadratures. Accordingly I take an empirical
and integrable function, say v, such that 1%, = %42 and % = Uy, and apply the rules
