PETROLOGCH

By N. S. Maskelyne, P.R.S.

Tug numerous specimens illustrating the rock formations of the Tsle of Rodri-
guez, collected by Mr. I. Bayley Balfour from different localities, need only a cursory
inspection to attest the volcanic character of the whole mass of the island.

© Rodriguez, in fact, consists of Doleritic layas that appear to haye been poured
out at a considerable number of yolcanic orifices at successive periods. It would be
difficult, without more minute description of the physical geography of the island
than is accessiþle, to assign any precise date or duration to these volcanic eruptions,
or to trace with any certainty the degree to which and the mode in which sabse-
quent denudation has helped in giving the island its present remarkable aspect.

But the fact-of that denudation and the degree to which alteration has proceeded
in affecting the minerals composing rocks that by their position must have been
among the later of the out-poured lavas, would point to a remote date, possibly to
one contemporary with the tertiary period, as that of the volcanic activity of
Rodriguez.
