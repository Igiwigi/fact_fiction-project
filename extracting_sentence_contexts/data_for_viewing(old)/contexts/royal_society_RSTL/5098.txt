116 COLONEL SABINE ON PERIODICAL LAWS DISCOVERABLE

The variation in the amount of disturbance in the different years presented in this
Table, has certainly far more the aspect of a periodical inequality, than of what may
be called for distinction's sake, accidental variation. The character, with the Single
exception already noticed, is that of an increase systematically progressive between
the years 1843 and 1848. But the existence of a periodical inequality of this nature,
affecting at the same time, and in the same manner, parts of the globe most remote
from each other, would be a circumstance of such extreme importance in theoretical
respects, that we are bound to receive the facts which may appear to indicate it with
the utmost caution, and to await the confirmation it may obtain from contempora-
neous observations at other stations. The magnetic disturbances present as well-
marked and as notable features over the greater part of Europe as they do at
Toronto and Hobarton ; and there exist, or there should exist at those European
observatories which have professed to adopt and carry out the system of observation
proposed by the Royal Society, hourly or two-hourly observations, not only contem-
poraneous but simultaneous with those which have been discussed in this paper, and
which, if examined, should yield corresponding conclusions, if the phenomena be
general. In magnetical no less than in astronomical observations, the work of an
observatory is but partially performed, until the observations have been suhjected to
processes of reduction, and their bearing on the points of theory for which they
were instituted has been examined and shown.
