In the paper jusb quoted, MAXWELL presented the remarkable
result that on theoretical grounds the coefficient of friction, or the viscosity, should be
independent of the density of the gas, although ab the same time he states that the
only experiments he had met with on the subject did not seem to confirm his views,

An elaborate series of experiments were undertaken by MAXWELL to tesb 80 remark-
able a consequence of a mathematical theory ; and in 1866, in the Bakerian lecture for
that year,} he published the results under the title of * The Viscosity or Internal
Friction of Air and other Gases.” He found the coefficient of friction in air to be
practically constant for pressures between 30 inches and 0'5 inch ; in fact, numbers
calculated on the hypothesis that the viscosity was independent of the density agreed
very well with the observed values. The apparatus used by MaxwELL was not of a character to admit of experiments
with much lower pressures than 0'5 inch,

MM. Kuxpr and WaARBURG, © On Friction and Heat Conduction in Rarefied Gases,”
in which the laws theoretically discovered by MAXWELL were examined at higher
exhaustions.
