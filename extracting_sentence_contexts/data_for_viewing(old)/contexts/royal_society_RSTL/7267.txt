and it is consequently a linear transformation of the last-mentioned function ; 80 that
the application of 'TscnIRNHAusEN's transformation to the equation U=0 gives an
equation linearly transformable into, and thus virtually equivalent to, the equation
U'U+49'H=0,
!
which is an equation involving the single parameter =; this appears to me a result of
considerable interest. It is to be remarked that TscnIRnuatsen's transformation,
wherein y is put equal to a rational and integral function of the order 2—1 (if a be the
order of the equation in @), is not really less general than the transformation wherein

7 is put equal to any rational function xy Whatever of 7; 8ch rational function may, in

fact, by means of the given equation in &, be reduced to a rational and integral function
of the order n—1; hence in the present case, taking V, W to be respectively of the

order 2—1, =3, it follows that the equation in y obtained by the elimination of & from
the equations

(a, b, e, d, eXwx, 1)'=0,
—(@,Þ,y, Ye, 1)

(ﬆ, 8, YON, 1)®
is a mere linear transformation of the equation AU+BH=0, where A, B are functions
(not as yet calculated) of (@, 6, c, d, e, «a, B, y.3, «&,Þ,y,F).
