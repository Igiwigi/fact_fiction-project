Very little, indeed, is known of the factors which are causally related to
the initial differentiation of vascular tissue, the absence of such knowledge being a serious
obstacle to further progress. Lang (1915) suggested that among these factors may be
included (i) functional stimuli, (ii) the inductive influence of the older differentiated parts
on the developing region, or (iii) formative stimuli of unknown nature proceeding from the
developing region. The relation of functional stimuli to morphogenetic processes is a prob-
lem of very great difficulty: it may be that no such direct relationship does, in fact, exist. In the normal development the second factor suggested by Lang—the inductive influence
of older, preformed parts—may well be of considerable importance. This view, which has
had many adherents, may now be considered in the light of the data given here.
