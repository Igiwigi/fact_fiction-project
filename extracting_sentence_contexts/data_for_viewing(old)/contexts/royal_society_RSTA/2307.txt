This proof is connected to the fact that the composition of any three independent non-
contextual boxes yields a final box that is also non-contextual (with three independent non-
contextual hidden variables). NCW is however more powerful than such compositions because the
pre- and post-processing boxes here are not independent. Still, the restriction of equation (3.3)
enables non-contextuality preservation [15]. For space-like separated measurements, NCW reduces
to local operations assisted by shared randomness, the canonical free operations of Bell non-locality
[16-18]. This also shows that non-contextual wirings is not the largest set of free operations for
contextuality, since in the particular case of Bell scenarios it is known that local operations assisted
by shared randomness is not the largest set of free operations of non-locality. However, we still
lack a explicit parametrization for a larger set of free operations for contextuality, and we restrict
throughout to the class of non-contextual wirings, unless stated otherwise, since this is the class
for which we have a friendly parametrization with a clear physical interpretation.
