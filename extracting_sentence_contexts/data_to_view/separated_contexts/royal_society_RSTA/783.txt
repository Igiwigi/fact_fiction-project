It is shown later that ¢ = 0:1487 cm.~! and y = —0-00033 cm.~!, so that, except for

the very lowest values of K, the sum of the third and fourth terms in these expressions
can be neglected. Inspection of Tables XIII—XV shows that the four values of A, F/ (J)
which correspond to the same value of K are in fact equal when K is greater than four. Accordingly we can write

A, F'(K) = 4Bi(K+}) +8D,(K+ 3)?.
