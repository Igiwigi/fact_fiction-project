impulses and the muscular excitability, which is necessary for synchronous contractions,
Q will be restored, either fully or partially, according to the extent to which the
A excitability is raised. On the other hand, if the excitability be lowered then that due

& In accordance with this method of testing the excitability, experiment proves that

= T will now proceed to give the facts upon which the trath of this proposition
[8 depends, and will first examine the action of the nerve when the clamp in the auriculo-
3 ventricular groove is tightened 80 as to make the ventricle beat synchronously with
<= every second or third beat of the auricles.

Z In this case the most striking effect of stimulation of the nerve is the alteration
S which is produced in the rate of the ventricular rhythm rather than the variations in
£ the force of the ventricular contractions. It is true that the nerve stimulation may
= $till cause the force of the ventricular contractions to be diminished and augmented
= in the same way as already described, but neither the diminution nor the augmentation
D are 80 manifest as when the ventricle is beating synchronously with every auricular
S beab; this is doubtless Jargely owing to the greater 8ize of the ventricular contractions
E in consequence of their slower rate of rhythm. This is, however, nob the main
