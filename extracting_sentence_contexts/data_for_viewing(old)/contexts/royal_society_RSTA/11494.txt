(3) Conclusions to be drawn trom the form of (vi.).

(a) The distribution of the errors of frequency constants, if treated exactly, will
generally be skew, for the cubic and higher terms in the A’s do not vanish. If,
however, the cubic terms are small as compared with the square terms, the frequency
distribution of errors will approximate closely to a normal correlation surface.

It would be impossible to evaluate the remainder after the second power terms in
Tay.or’s series for any general expression f (i), #2, ... 23 Cj, Cx, ... ¢,) for frequency.
In special cases we have found that terms of the third order amount in the most
unfavourable circumstances to 4 per cent. of the terms of the second order, generally to
« good deal less.* Probably the series in most cases converges with considerable
rapidity. The fact, however, that we are dealing with the first terms of a series should
be borne in mind. It does not seem to have been sufficiently emphasised when the
probable error of the standard deviation is taken to be 67°449/,/2n per cent. of the
standard deviation. The usual proof of this result, however, involves the same
assumption as to the smallness of the cubic terms,

(8) Supposing the errors so small that we may neglect the cubic terms, we
conclude that the errors made in calculating the constants of any frequency distribu-
tion are—

(i.) Themselves distributed according to the normal law of errors,
(ii.) Correlated among themselves.
