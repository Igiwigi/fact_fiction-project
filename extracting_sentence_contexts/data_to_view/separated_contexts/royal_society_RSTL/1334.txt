Second and third'application were followed by the same effects,
but further applications were of no avail. It then occurred
to me that motions might re-appear, if I again touched the
two coatings with the probe, and the event proved the conjec-
ture to have been fortunate ; for after every application of the
probe to the two coatings, contractions were several times ex-
Cited by it. The fact being thus established, that under certain
Circumstances contractions could be produced by silver alone,

the condition of the muscles and nerve being unaltered by
that experiment, the silver had gained some new property by
coming into contact with the tin-foil. The point in doubt was
s0on determined, by applying the probe to a. piece of tin-foil,
which had no connection with any part of the animal. for,
when this was done, it was again enabled to produce con=
tractions.
