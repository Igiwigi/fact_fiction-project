For large values of » the probable error of the determination of the end-point may be
found approximately by multiplying the probable error of location by

(p—4) V3.

As p grows smaller, »’ diminishes until it reaches unity, when p = 1. For values of
p less than 1 it would appear that the end-point had a smaller probable error than the
probable error of location, but, as a matter of fact, for these values location is determined
by the end-point, and as we see from the vanishing of ,, whether or not p and a
are known, when p = 1, the weight of the determination from this point onwards increases
more rapidly than », as the sample increases. (See Section 10.)

The above method illustrates how it is possible to calculate the variance of any
function of the population parameters as estimated from large samples ; by comparing
this variance with that of the same function estimated by the method of moments, we
may find the efficiency of that method for any proposed function. The above examina-
tion, in which the determinations of the locus, the scale, and the form of the curve are
treated separately, will serve as a general criterion of the application of the method of
moments to curves of Type III. _ Special combinations of the parameters will, however,
be of interest in special cases. It may be noted here that by virtue of equation (2) the
