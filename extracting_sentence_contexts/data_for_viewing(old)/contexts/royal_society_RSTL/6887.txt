and sunrise on the former day was 38?, while on the latter it was 41%. Indeed between
April and September a range of 40* in clear weather was quite common—or more than
double the amount which it is in London at the corresponding season of the year.

A freedom of escape similar to that from bodies at great elevations would occur at
any other level were the vapour removed from the air above it. Hence the withdrawal
of the sun from any region over which the atmosphere is dry, must be followed by quick
refrigeration. This is simply an @ priori conclusion from the facts established by expe-
riment; but I believe all the experience of meteorology confirms it. The winters in
Tibet are almost unendurable from this cause. The isothermals dip deeply from the
north into Central Asia during the winter, the earth's heat being wasted without impe-
diment in space, and no sun existing sufficiently powerful to make good the loss. T
believe the fact is well established that the desert of Sahara, which during the day is
burning hot, is often extremely cold at night. This effect has been hitherto referred in
a general way to the © purity of the air;” but purity, as judged by the eye, is a yery
imperfect test of radiation, for the existence of large quantities of vapour is consistent
with a transparent atmosphere. The purity really consists im the absence of aqueous
vapour from those s0-called rainless districts, which, when the sun is withdrawn, enables
the hot surface of the earth to run speedily down to a freezing temperature.

On the most serene days the atmosphere may be charged with vapour ; in the Alps,
for example, it often happens that skies of extraordinary clearness are the harbingers of
rain. On snch days, no matter how pure the air may seem to the eye, terrestrial radia-
tion is arrested. And here we have the simple explanation of an interesting fact noticed
