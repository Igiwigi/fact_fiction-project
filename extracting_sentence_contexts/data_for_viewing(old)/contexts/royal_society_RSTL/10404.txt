Measured thus some time after transformation (Plate 18, fig. 4, nc., tr.) the notochord |
is about two-fifths the length of the basis cranii ; thus we see that 1b remains as an
important basi-cranial structure, but in its earliest development it shows nothing of
the cephalo-chordal character of Amphiozus. The membranous sheath of the noto-
chord is very thick at this early stage ; at no stage have I found true cartilage in it,
8nch as we see in the Elasmobranchs. The primary basi-cranial cartilages (iv., tr.) are
para-chordal for their hinder three-fifths, and pro-chordal for their front two-tifths, but
the front part is thick and wide, whilst the hind part attenuates gently to a fine, pointed
end ; these two ends are, however, far back behind the ear-capsules ; two-fifths of the
parachordal length of the cartilage is behind the ear. Considering the size of the
region 8upplied by the branches of the vagus nerve, it is not unreasonable to take all
the parachordal region of the notochord as properly basi-cranial ; the fact is, the head
and spine are not divided off sharplyâ€” there is no joint ; afterwards, when the neural
arches appear in the transformed Fish, the first pair of cartilages give us the beginning
of the spine.

These parts cling cloe to the sides of the notochord, 0 as to be crescentic in section
(see Plate 25, figs. 3, 4, iv., nc.) nearly to the middle of the auditory capsules (au.);
thence they diverge further and further from the axial rod. In front of that rod, in
their pro-chordal part, the bars (trabeculee) are geparated by a tract thrice their greatesb
