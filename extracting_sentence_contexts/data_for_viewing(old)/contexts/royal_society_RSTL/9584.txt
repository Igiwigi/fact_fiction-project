instances (to which many others might be added) of rhythmical action where the pre-
sence of ganglia is out of the question. Again, in a general way, is it not jus as we
recede from these primitive forms of contractile tissue that we find rhythmic action to
become less usnal ? And, if this is 80, may it not be that those contractile tissues
which in the higher animals manifest rhythmic action are the contractile tissues which
have longest retained their primitive endowment of rhythmicality ? To my mind it
seers hard to decide in what respect the beating of a Snail's heart differs from that of
the pulsatile yesicles of the Infusoria ; and T do not think ib would be much easier to
decide in what essential respect it differs from the beating of the Mammalian heart.
The mere fact that the presence of ganglia can be proved in the one case and nob in
the other, seems to me scarcely to justify the conclusion that the rhythm is in the one
cage wholly dependent, and in the other as wholly independent, of the ganglia. At
any rate, this fact, if it is a fact, is not of 80 self-evident a character as to recommend
to us the current theory of ganglionic action on @ priori grounds.

(7.) Coming, then, to experimental tests, we have already seen that in the de-
ganglionated 8wimming organ of Aurelia aurita, rhythmic response is yielded to
constant, faradaic stimulation of low intensity. The next question, therefore, which
presents itself in relation to our subject, is as to whether other modes of constant
stimulation elicit a similar response. Now, in a general way, I may say that such is
the case, although IT have chosen faradaic stimulation for special mention, because, in
the first place, its effect in producing rhythmic action is the most certain and precise,
and, in the next place, the effects of administering instantaneous shocks at given
intervals admit of being compared with the effects of constant faradaic stimulation
