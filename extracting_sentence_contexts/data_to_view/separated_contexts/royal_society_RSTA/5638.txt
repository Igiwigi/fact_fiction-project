We can now decompose Uj,;+,, ina pair of fermionic
rishons, specifically as SiS, wa These rishons are exotic fermions, since they mutually anti-
commute, ie. {8,,., Gl = (507 8} =0 for jz jor uA’, yet they are 3-hardcore, i.e. B, =04
Bur in contrast to standard (Dirac) fermions which are 2-hardcore. In fact, it is possible to build such a rishon from two Dirac-fermion subspecies a and b at each
site, with standard rules {4,44 wh = (jb wi = 5 jum and all the other anti-commutators

zero. € can then be written as
+ +
Fue = 95 Mundin + (1 — Gj Bin )ajn- (4.2)
The electric field operator L can similarly be expressed as a function of these field operators,
specifically
+ + + . +
QL ijt = 94 Mine + Oj Bie — Gp pti tn—n — Oj n —pbjtn—n- (4.3)
As we perform these substitutions into the lattice QED Hamiltonian, we observe that the total
parity of fermions (rishons and matter) at each site is preserved by each and single term, ie.

it is a symmetry of the problem. In other words, each operator, acting on site j, appearing in
the Hamiltonian, effectively commutes with any other term in the Hamiltonian acting on site


j/: the mapping has defermionized the interacting many-body problem, as it can be equivalently
expressed as a (large, interacting) spin-problem with the same interaction range (in this case,
nearest-neighbour in the dressed sites). While we presented explicit defermionization of three-gauge-states QED, we stress that a
similar procedure is available for any arbitrary cut-off of the gauge field, thus it can be carried
out at every energy scale without loss of generality.
