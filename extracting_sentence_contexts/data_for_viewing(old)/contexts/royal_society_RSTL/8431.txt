Every thing indicates that the actual focus, where fire and water contend and produce
yolcanic action, is at no great depth below the volcanic vent.

Q he directions of the shocks felt during eruptions by observyers not far removed from

the axes of volcanic vents conclusively establish this. The centre of impulse of these

Szhocks is coincident (on the whole) with the volcanic focus. Now, were this at a great
SZdepth, the emergent wavye-paths around the base of the volcanic cone, and for considerable
distances from it, must be almost vertical; houses &ec. shaken down must show that they

of the cracks produced in a large number of more or less ancient church-towers and
