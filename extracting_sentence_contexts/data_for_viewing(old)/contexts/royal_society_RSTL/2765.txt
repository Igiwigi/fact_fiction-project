[ STRUCTURE OF THE CRYSTALLINE LENSES OF ANIMALS. 43

cides with that of the eye. The length of the axis is 0'327, and its equatorial dia-
meter 0'273 of an inch.

In some quadrupeds I haye observed an irregularity in the septa, which may have
arisen either from an original malconformation of the lens, or from some accidental
injury. In the lens of a horse I observed a spurious septum, one of the three being
double. The same fact will be more particularly noticed in describing the lens of
the elephant, in which it is more common.

F 4. On the Anatomical and Optical Structure of the Crystalline Lenses of Animals,
particularly those of the Whale, the Seal, the Bear, and the Elephant.

= From the lenses of quadrupeds in which the fibres are related to three septa, I shall
3 now proceed to descrihe the fourth and last class of symmetrical structures, in which
B the fibres are related to four septa, placed at right angles to one another. This com-
S bination of fibres is of rare occurrence, and I have found it only in the lenses of the
5 whale, the seal, and the bear.

Z The character of this structure will be understood from Plate V. figg. 1 and 2,
