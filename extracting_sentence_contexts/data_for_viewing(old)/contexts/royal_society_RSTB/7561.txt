dermis), the fact that the graft proper was not significantly invaded is weakened as an
argument.

(ii) Evidence from the first-set grafts

The only relationship found between the speed of breakdown of the present homografts
and their cellular infiltration was for the lymphocytes in the grafis at 8 days after trans-
plantation, i.e. just at the beginning of breakdown for the average set of grafts; the faster
the speed of breakdown the greater was the lymphocyte concentration at this time
(P<0-05). This result can be interpreted in terms either of cause or effect (a strong
vascular inflammation indicated that the immunity reaction had begun). It is not sur-
prising that such a relationship was not found at 12 days, since the destructive reaction
would then be on the wane in the more rapidly destroyed grafts. The fact that no relation-
ship to speed of graft destruction was found for the immature or mature plasma cells, or
their sum, means that in these experiments they did not fulfil a requirement which would
be expected of an important cause of the destruction. This of course depends on the
assumption about variation in cell potency from animal to animal, cell potency being
defined as the ratio of the destructive power of the cell to the resistance of the graft tissues.
It can be remarked on this point that it is more economical to assume that the variation
(if any) is randomly distributed rather than to make the two assumptions: (a) that the
cell potency is greater in those animals whose grafts are destroyed faster and (b) that this
effect is strong enough to mask a relationship between cell numbers and speed of graft
breakdown.

Mature plasma cells alone fulfilled the fourth condition listed above for an effect, in
