This results in 10 possible trends for each individual model simulation. I then assume
that a plausible range for any observable is given by the range of simulation results from those
models that capture the observed value in their range of simulations. This reasoning is based
on the fact that we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed evolution of the climate
system follows a rather unlikely extreme trajectory for the given change in forcing. Hence, for
any observable those models that have the observed trajectory at the extreme upper end of their
simulated trajectories must currently be assumed to be equally likely to be correct as those that
have the observed trajectory at the extreme lower end of their simulated trajectories. Unless we
obtain an independent estimate of internal variability, the range obtained is the possible range
of climate trajectories.
