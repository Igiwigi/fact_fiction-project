The data shows that the higher the repellency (higher CA), the higher the water
collection. The decreasing order of the water collection rate per unit area on a homogeneous
wettability flat surface is superhydrophobic surface using 10m, hydrophobic, hydrophilic,
and superhydrophilic. This is attributed to the fact that the higher the repellency, the more
spherical the droplet shape will be, which results in a lower contact area between the droplet
and the surface. Therefore, less heat will be transferred into the droplet and less evaporation
will be observed. As shown in the optical images, large spherical droplets are formed on the
superhydrophobic surface which roll down.
