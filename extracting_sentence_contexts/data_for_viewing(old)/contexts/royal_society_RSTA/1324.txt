reduction and m=3 (figure 3b,f), we see that both solutions have the same MAE performance
for the mean approximation but the energy distance approximates better the variance structure.
For m=4 (figure 3c,g ), the results are mixed. The energy distance reduction maintains perfectly
the mean behaviour in contrast to the Wasserstein distance. But this comes at the cost of a
worse explanation of the variance structure. For m=5 (figure 3d,h), the picture is clear. The
energy distance has a better approximation in all considered characteristics. Another fact that
can be observed for m =5 is that in the last step from t = 4 to t=5, the energy distance captures
better the path dependency than the Wasserstein distance. In a binary tree, the ratio of branches
which go upwards and downwards is equally distributed. As 11 =5 is odd this can never be
perfectly captured in ensemble reduction. The energy distance reduction selects three increasing
and two decreasing paths from f=4 to f=5. On the other hand, the optimal Wasserstein
distance reduction provides one increasing trajectory and four decreasing trajectories which is
an unnecessary bias from the true behaviour.

For the scenario reduction (figure 4) with m > 2, the quantitative measures are even more in
favour for the energy distance. Here, in all characteristics, the energy distance reduction obtains
preferable results. Moreover, we note that the weights (figure 4b-d) of the energy distance are
more equally distributed among all paths than for the Wasserstein distance (figure 4f-n). This is
