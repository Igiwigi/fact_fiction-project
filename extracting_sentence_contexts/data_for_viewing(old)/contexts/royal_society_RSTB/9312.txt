2PN set-ups seem necessary for studies of real social interaction
whenever people mutually regulate their dynamic coupling, co-
adapting their behaviours. Whether we should take the 2PN
approach instead of the easier and more controlled 1PN
approach (a spectator view) depends essentially on the timing
of the behaviour of interest; phenomena where information is
exchanged between the participants at time intervals shorter

than 100 ms would need time-resolved brain imaging methods,
such as MEG or EEG.

Motivation for two-person ‘hyperscanning’ also derives
from the fact that the human brain and mind are shaped
from cradle to grave by the interaction with other people.
It is even thought that sociality has drastically driven the
evolution of the human brain [53]. Importantly, sociality is
a group property emerging in relation to other people.
From the experimental point of view, it is evident that with-
out measuring two persons at the same time the natural
social interaction is difficult or impossible to tackle because
the interaction sequences cannot be repeated so that the
subjects’ brain activity could be measured sequentially.

For 2PN purposes, we have recently built a set-up for sim-
ultaneous MEG-to-MEG recordings between two sites. The
