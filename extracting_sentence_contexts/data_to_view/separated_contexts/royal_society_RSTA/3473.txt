It is possible that the action takes
place very slowly in dry gases, but it seems probable that, if so, it occurs in a different
way, as for example, by the direct combination of dissociated atoms. The function of
the water-vapour we have assumed to be to form a centre about which the hydrogen
and chlorine molecules can assemble, so that the atoms come into each other's spheres
of action and can re-arrange themselves, giving rise to a system of greater stability. This process we have supposed to take place by the formation of molecular compounds,
and we have seen that a great many of the facts are explained on this hypothesis. We can regard this catalytic action as not essentially different from the catalytic
action of such substances as platinum black. In these cases the gases in the action,
helped by such a catalyser, probably form condensed layers on the catalyser, and thus
the actual molecules of the combining gases are brought into very intimate contact,
and re-arrangement of the atoms may take place.
