which close affinities appear to exist between the Lyginodendron and Rachiopteris
aspera, also described in the Memoir, Part VI.

Canals, precisely like those in the bark of Kaloxylon Hookeri, exist equally in the
inner bark of Lyginodendron and of Rachiopteris aspera. The latter is unquestion-
ably a rachis of a Fern; whilst the former displays a wonderfully clear exogenous
development of its xylem zone. I have more than once, in previous memoirs,
suggested that the 2. aspera was the petiole of the leaf of the Lyginodendron ; and
my friend, the Count pg Sotms, of Gottenburg, who has obtained numerous examples
of these two plants from the Westphalian deposit at Pith Vollmond, has arrived
independently at the same conclusion. If we are correct in this supposition, we have
now, for the first time, in Lyginodendron Oldhamium, a Fern of which the stem or
rachis exhibits a highly developed form of exogenous growth. This fact in some
degree influences our interpretations of the two species of Heterangium, in both of
which we find in the outermost bark the remarkable horizontal bands of dense
sclerenchyma represented in Plate 22, fig. 11, of the present memoir, and in
Plate 29, fig. 32, hâ€™, and Plate 31, figs. 45, 47, and 49 of the Memoir,
Part IV., in which Heterangium Grievii was first described. This remarkable
peculiarity in the structure of the outer cortex of these two plants has led to a
careful search for any fossil stems, with their foliage attached, in which a similar
structure seemed to exist. Some months ago Mr. Krpson sent me some stems which
he believed to belong to Sphenopteris elegans, the cortex of which displayed an
exactly similar series of thickened horizontal parallel bands. Still more recently he
received from my friend Professor von Weiss, of Berlin, and forwarded to me, a
beautiful specimen of an exactly identical stem, attached to which are the unques-
