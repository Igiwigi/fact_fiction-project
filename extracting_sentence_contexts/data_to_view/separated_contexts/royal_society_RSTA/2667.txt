In any
case, the true physical origin of the so-called asperities needs further careful examination. Large events of the present 2D model tend to be unilateral, with its epicentre lying at the rim
of the rupture zone. In fact, the epicentre of the target event is located just next to the rim of the
rupture zone of some past event, the rupture propagating away from the rupture zone of that past
event. Hence, the events of the 2D model are of type-I in the terminology of [40]. In the recurrence
of large events, while there is a characteristic recurrence time, an immediate recurrence of large
events in the form of twin events is also possible.
