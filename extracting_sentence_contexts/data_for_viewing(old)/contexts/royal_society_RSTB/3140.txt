insertion of the sporange and in having both the micro- and the mega- sporangium
integumented. The velum to the microsporangium of Lepidocarpon was, however,
incomplete and possibly inconstant, and there are many species of Isoétes with an
incomplete velum and others, such as /soétes Tasmanica, with none at all. The velum
of Lepidocarpon and that of Miadesmia agree in both enclosing the ligule. In Isoétes
the opening is proximal, in Lepidocarpon radially extended, in Miadesmia it is distal.
In fact, the velum differs so much in these three cases that we are compelled to regard
each as of independent origin. This rather surprising conclusion points to there
having been a widespread tendency to vary towards seed formation in the Paleozoic
era. Lepidocarpon and possibly Miadesmia date back to the Lower Carboniferous flora.
So also does Mazocarpon, another Lycopodinean genus, which is shortly to be described,
showing an incipient velum originating from the wall of the megasporange. Probably
this will be shown to be connected with fertilisation rather than protection, and it is
possible that it was primarily for the collection of microspores that the Miadesmia
velum was evolved.

Among the Calamites the formation of an upgrowth of tissue in the form of radially
placed lamellz from the abaxial surface of the coherent whorl of bracts has been
recorded by Renault.* Protection was thus afforded to the sporangia of the whorl
