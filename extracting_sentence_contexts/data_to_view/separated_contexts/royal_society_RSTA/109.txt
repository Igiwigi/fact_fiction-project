It will cease to hold at DD’, when the waves
from B, B’ first reach the other ends of the aerofoil at D’ and D respectively. However,
a process of successive approximation will be found by which the solution can be continued,
first for the portion DF, and then for successive portions of length 2ah. The process, in fact,
consists in the addition to the original wave system of successively more complicated waves
beginning at DD’, FF’ and so on. Mathematically, the technique required for this treatment is very similar to that intro-
duced by Sommerfeld (1897) in his classic discussion of the diffraction of electromagnetic
waves at a semi-infinite perfectly conducting obstacle, and later simplified and developed
by various authors, including Lamb and Carslaw. In particular, our method of the succes-
sive introduction of new waves at D, F, etc., is very similar to the approximate method
employed by Schwarzschild (1902) for the solution of the problem of diffraction at a slit of
monochromatic electromagnetic radiation.
