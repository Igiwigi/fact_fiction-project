grow until arrested by meeting with other growths. From these arms other arms
again shoot out, and so on until the entire metal is solidified ; but each crystalline
element as it settles into place on any of these arms must assume the proper orientation
to enable it to fit in, and in the process of filling space by means of such a system of
many meeting, and interlacing arms the formation of a twin would be almost
impossible. But when the metal crystallises after severe strain it does so by the
growth of skeleton arms that must often start from a cleavage plane of an actual
solid crystal, and probably the new elements deposited upon such a plane would find
it as easy to assume the twin orientation as the normal.‚Äù

In the present case it is exceedingly probable that practically all the patches of new
orientation start from a cleavage plane, and hence the formation of twin crystals
would be exceedingly common, as in fact it is. F

In conclusion, the author would like to express his thanks to Professor Ewe for
the great help and many suggestions which he has given. The research has been
carried out, under his direction, in the Engineering Laboratory at Cambridge.
