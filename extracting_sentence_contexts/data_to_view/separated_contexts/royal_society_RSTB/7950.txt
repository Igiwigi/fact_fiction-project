proposed (Halford et al. 2001). A more recent study
on human OPN3 confirms the wide tissue distribution

rods and cones, the outer plexiform, inner plexiform
and ganglion cell layers of the retina (White er al.
2008). A comparison of Opn3 with the visual opsins
shows a low amino acid identity of approximately 30
per cent (table 1).
