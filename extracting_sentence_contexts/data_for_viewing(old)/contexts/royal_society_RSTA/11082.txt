long-shaped isolated crystals of the X body in a network which is shown by a power
of 20 diameters to be an exquisite eutectic of the E and X bodies. The photograph,
before etching, of a horizontal section of this alloy (fig. 27) shows several dark
erystals of the purple AuAl,, bordered by white X, and surrounding the large
patches of white, the eutectic is seen. It is evident that the uppermost fugitive
freezing point.is due to the solidification of the purple AuAl,, that the well-marked
freezing point at the G temperature marks the moment when purple ceases to form
and the crystallisation of X begins. At this moment the still liquid part of the alloy
has reached the composition given by G. As the alloy continues to cool, the liquid
part traverses all the stages of temperature and composition corresponding to the
points on the branch GF, crystals of pure X erystallising during this period. Finally,
the residual liquid attains the composition of F, and the eutectic network forms at a
constant temperature. The facts that the alloys between H and G are the only ones
which plainly show three solid constitutents, and that the solid alloy at G is a

* January 30, 1900.—An alloy whose analysis gave 44°1 atoms of aluminium, which therefore must be close
to the transition point G, shows after prolonged etching with bromine water a very fine eutectic surrounding
isolated spots of the primary crystallisation of X. A photograph of this is given in fig. 25. Figs. 22 and
25 are complementary ; both contain the same eutectic, but the large primary crystals are in fig. 22 of
AugAl and in fig. 25 of the X body, dark through etching.
