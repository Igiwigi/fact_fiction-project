The null hypothesis was not rejected in most sites (i.e. the generated data
matched the observed ones; table 2). Thus, we here focus on the remaining
exceptional sites. In statistical hypothesis testing, the test could incorrectly reject
the null hypothesis with the probability equal to the significance level, even when
the null hypothesis is in fact true (known as a false positive; [3]). In figure 2, the
geographical distribution of sites with the significant differences is shown. There
were no significant differences in the K-S tests for the monthly distributions for
Tax, Tmin, SR, RH and WS.
