must take place are only carbon, its vapour, and the slight trace of impurities which:
the author thinks essential to the existence of the are.

If the impurity be assumed to be a salt of potassium, there is the possibility that a
carbide of potassium might be formed, and that part of the P.D. might be due to the
are forming a cell, having carbon and potassium carbide as its electrodes, and the
vapour column as the electrolyte, the products produced by the flow of the current
through the cell being conceived to be destroyed in the flame which surrounds the
are proper.

That a chemical combination between the carbon and surrounding gas is not the
cause of the back E.M.F., at any rate in the normal silent arcs considered here, is
evident from the fact that the arc is but little affected by the nature of the gas in

which it burns, as has been shown by Professor 8. P. THompson and others. Putting
aside the possible combination of the carbon with the slight trace of impurity, which
may account for a small part of the back E.M.F., the polarisation E.M.F.â€™s do not
seem able to account satisfactorily for the whole back E.M.F. of the are, without
making assumptions which are at present unsupported by any satisfactory evidence.

Against the back E.M.F. of the are being due to thermo-electric forces, it is
generally urged that these forces are usually reckoned in tenths and hundredths of
