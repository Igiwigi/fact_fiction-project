LBMD technology based on the quasi-atomistic force field for proteins OPEP will be deployed to

study the shear rate dependence of the A2 unfolding rate, and, following the pioneering work of

4. Conclusion

In summary, using a multiscale simulation method that represents water and proteins at the
mesoscopic level paves the way for studying massive macromolecular systems composed
of thousands of proteins.
