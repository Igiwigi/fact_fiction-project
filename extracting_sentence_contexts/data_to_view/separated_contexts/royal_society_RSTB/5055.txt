The similarity in structure between these Amphibian lymphatics aad the “ fine”
vessels of Lophius has probably no morphological significance, but it shows that such
a structure, though unusual, is in no way incompatible with the character of a lymphatic. Summary. So far as one can judge from the facts ascertained, there are in Lophius and in the
cod, and probably in other Teleostean fishes, lymphatic vessels of two kinds, differing
from one another in structure and contents :—

1. An extensive system of vessels of the ordinary lymphatic type ; delicate in structure,
irregular in outline, inclining to lacunar or sinus-like expansion ; separable into regional
but freely intercommunicating systems; draining lymph with a slight admixture of
red blood corpuscles from all parts of the body and viscera ; opening directly into the
veins through sinus-like reservoirs situated in the head or fore-part of the body. These are the lymphatics that have been described in greater or less detail by ALLEN,
Trois, FouMaNN, and many others.
