jugular and subclavian veins, the left intercostals and certain cardiac veins ; or B, it
is reduced to a smaller left yenous trunk, which receives merely the left intercostal
veins and some cardiac veins; or, C, it remains as a still smaller vessel, receiving
only a few cardiac veins from the substance of the heart. These three conditions
accordingly are distinguished by severally presenting—

A. A right and a left vena cava superior.

B. A right yena caya superior and a left azygos venous trunk,

C. A right vena cava superior and a left cardiac venous trunk or coronary sinus,
the veins from the substance of the heart terminate, and which will then be recognized as the great coronary
vein, This is the condition in Man and in most Mammalia. In fact, in no mammalian does the left canal of
Cvy1xx entirely disappear. Even in cases where by far the largest portion of it is obliterated, that part which
runs along the posterior transverse furrow of the heart remains as the trunk of the cardiac veins.” I have

availed myself of Dr. BarveLeBex's memoir, to introduce some additional examples of varieties of the great
yeins in animals.

Group A. A right and a left vena cava superior.—This condition exists in a large
number of the lower Mammalia, viz. in the Monotremata* and Marsnpialia+; in
most Rodentia, as in the Dormouse®, Marmotte*, Rat+h, Echimys*, Mouse$\,
