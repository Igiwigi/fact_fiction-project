A NORTH SEA STORM SURGE 391

(iv) 12.004 1 February. Over the whole sea the winds are beginning to moderate, and in
the south are almost due north. This latter fact manifests itself in the decay of the easterly
water gradient between England and Holland which has been in evidence almost through-
out. The southern coasts of Denmark have experienced their maximum disturbances, and
the effect of the earthâ€™s rotation is evident as the disturbance decays. This effect has been
well established in previous investigations, but it is of interest to note that even when such
an exceptionally large disturbance is concerned, the geostrophic effect can be detected in
both the growth and the decay of the oscillation.

(v) 15.00h 1 February to 03.00h 2 February.
