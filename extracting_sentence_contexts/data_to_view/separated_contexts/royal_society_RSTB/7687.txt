What we have got to realize is that you are backtracking,
and fair enough, you have got to go back in time, but we have got to consider a bottom-up approach, in other
words, we take initial conditions seriously. So we have got to see why life would have started and when it did and
also to remind people that geological time is not something you can just use willy-nilly. In fact, in order to get a
living system going would probably take days or weeks. If you just think of the incubator where life started it would
self-organise very quickly, otherwise it would not get off the ground, so to speak. So it is much shorter; the span
of life originating is short, and the molecules that we use are much shorter than people have assumed.
