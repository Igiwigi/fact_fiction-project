their bodies seldom extended straight, but usually bent in several curves; they appear
to bend over towards their mouthed zooid from time to time, as if to convey food. All
the zooids are retracted on alarm with remarkable snddenness, disappearing entirely
within the calicles.

When a portion of the coral has been placed living in reagents, it is found, when
hardened, to be bristling all over with sheaves of threads shot from the thread-cells
around the mouths of the calicles. By some accident, on one small portion of a coral
placed in absolute alcohol, the mouthless zooids all remained partially protruded. This
was only over a small area of about + of a square inch in dimensions, enough to yield a
single microscopical preparation. From a very large quantity of the coral prepared in
an exactly similar manner, no second preparation could be obtained, though it was all
searched over carefully for similarly expanded zooids. 'This fact, however, shows that
perhaps it might have been possible to obtain a larger quantity of expanded zooids in
the hardened condition by the gradual addition of alcohol or fresh water to the s8ea-
water in which the living animals were expanded, or by some similar means; or
perhaps by sndden addition of osmic-acid solution as recommended by F. EK. ScruLzEÂ®.

The body of the zooids, when seen in transverse section, is found to consist (fig. 15)
of an ectodermal layer, beneath which is a layer of membrane, and an internal mass of
endodermal cells. 'The ectodermal layer, as studied in sections of hardened specimens,
appears to consist of well-defined cells, most of which contain small thread-cells, whilst
some contain simple nuclei. 'The membranous layer is apparently structureless ; it
extends throughout the body and tentacles. Beneath the membranous layer, and in
