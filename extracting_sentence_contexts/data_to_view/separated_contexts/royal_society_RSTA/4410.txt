As P and Q enter in this expression symmetrically, the expression is precisely the same for

LAMAN — POW? + IM PE — Qui. The empirical QQ effect now follows from the assumption that the operators P,Q do not vary
across respondents (being determined by the questions alone), whereas the mixture of the initial
states y has the same distribution in any two large groups of respondents. At the same time, the
question order effect follows from the fact that |QPw||? is not generally the same as ||PQw \(?. The QQ equality trivially implies (3.2), ie. lack of contextuality. Therefore, to the extent that
the QQ equality can be viewed as an empirical law (and [26] demonstrates this convincingly
for 72 out of 73 question pairs), the criterion of non-contextuality should be satisfied for any
(V1), (W1), (V2), (W2).
