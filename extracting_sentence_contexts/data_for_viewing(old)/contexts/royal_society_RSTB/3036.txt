The figures 1-6, 10-12, 16-18, on Plates 18, 19 and 21, illustrate fully the
characters of each form. :

The value of the chromatophore-system is not confined to the identification of
adults. Perhaps its chief use is in the discrimination of larvae,

We have seen that in the development of Decapods, the zoea of each form hatches
with a perfectly constant supply of chromatophores. In each species of Palemon,
Hippolyte and Crangon that we have examined, the larva has one or more distinctive
centres, The secondary as well as the primary system is constant, both at the early
and late larval stages. The branch-system aind pigmentation offer other distinctive
features. The great taxonomic importance of the primary system lies in the fact
that the zoea of each species breeds true, and that the resulting primary system is
retained.

Tur Srructure, RELATIONS, AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHROMATOPHORES.
(Plates 21 and 22, figs. 19-23,.)

Very few attempts have been made towards elucidating the structure of the
chromatophores of Crustacea. Max Weser (1881), Hanier (1879), Marzporrr
(1884), and Maver (1882) have studied them in Isopods. PoucHrr (1876) has
given an account of them in the shrimp ; WacGyer (1896) and Nuspaum (1897) have
