It is now possible to pass on to a detailed description of the various lineages.

A phylogenetic table is given opposite (text-fig. A). The dotted lines indicate that
the lineage is probably existent, although its members have yet to be identified at
those horizons,

The space between the horizontal lines suggests the thickness of the zones.

The thickness of the lines representing the lineages is intended to suggest the
frequency of occurrence of the species in the main Chalk sea.

The table is designed merely to act as a general guide to the reader, for, in view of
our ignorance of much of the Chalk, only an approximate rendering of the true facts
can be given. A list of the genera described is given below.
