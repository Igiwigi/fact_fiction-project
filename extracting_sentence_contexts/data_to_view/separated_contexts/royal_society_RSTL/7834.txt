Of all the scores of microscopic sections of stems of which I have
either made or examined, it is remarkable that two examples alone exhibited evi-
dences of the existence of a bark, all the rest having been decorticated. The same
observation is applicable to those figured by Mr. Bixxey, in none of which is this tissue
seen. These facts show that the cohesion between the bark and the woody zone must,
have been exceedingly slight, at least in the small fragments inclosed in the ironstone
nodules from which the majority of our specimens retaining their structure have been
derived. The entire diameter of the s8mall stem referred to is 2 of an inch. The thickness of
the woody zone at the internode is about +05.
