We observe that on-chip networks are 22
at the break-even point, although many on-chip connections involve much shorter distances. : 8
Cost, density and energy are key factors preventing the use of photonics at this scale. The : s
cross-over point is at 1-10m distances where optical interconnects begin to replace electronic : s
interconnects on large scales. In fact, many data centres still use electrical connections from the 1B

servers to the ToR switch, although this is beginning to change starting from systems that host
high-performance computing applications. Several important features are apparent from the network capacity distance scaling shown in
figures 2 and 3. Network capacity is not a monotonically increasing function with distance as
one might expect due to aggregation over distance.
