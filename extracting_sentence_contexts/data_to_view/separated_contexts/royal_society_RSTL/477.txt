It may, however, be asked, are not there some sub-
gects of inquiry to which the geometrical method is better adapted
than the analytical ? and is not the theory of angular functions
one of these subjects ?* I apprehend not: for, if the conditions

intentionally. Dr, STEWwaRT, (Preface to Sun's Distance,) and after him his ingenious
biographer, for the purpose of holding up the superior simplicity of the geometrical
calculus, has aid, that in order to understand his solution, a knowledge of the ele-
ments and conic sections only is requisite. But, in fact, the solution; is effected by
proposition heaped on proposition ; and with equal truth and justness it might be
said, that in order to understand the analytical solution, a knowledge only of common
algebra is requisitez since the methods by which the solution is effected, are really and
properly branches of algebra.

* D'ALEMBERT ays, * there are cases in which analysis, instead of expediting,
embarasses demonstration. 'These cases happen in the computation of angles: for angles
can analytically be expressed only by their sines; and the expression of the sines of
angles is often very complicated,” &c. He adds, < that it must depend on mathema-
ticians, whether the method of the ancients or the modern analysis is to be employed,
since.it would be difficult to give on this head exact and general rules.” In the very
case adduced, I think demonstration expedited by the analytical calculus ; and, although

2. ten abnd is not 50 speedily put down as cos. z ; yet all processes of
evolution, differentiation, integration, &c. are much more easily performed with the
former expression than with the latter. Other instances of subjects of inquiry, to which
the geometrical method is said to be peculiarly well adapted, have been adduced ; but
1 sti!l find no convincing reason, why a mathematician must submit to the necessity of
