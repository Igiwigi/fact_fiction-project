in Europe from now to the end of this century was studied by the Netherlands
Energy Institute in 1998 (Lako et al. 1998). Some of the assumptions in this
study no longer look reasonable (e.g. that in 2100 the cost of oil would be $30 a
barrel!), although others still look sensible (e.g. the assumed cost of fusion power).
All such scenario modelling is of course subject to enormous uncertainties, and
should be seen as an exploration of what might happen—not a prediction of what
will happen. That said, the results are rather robust. If an unlimited coal supply
is assumed, and no constraints are put on consumption, coal will be dominant.
On the other hand, if atmospheric CO2 was assumed to be limited to below 600
ppm or a carbon tax of $30 per tonne or more was assumed, fusion was found
to play an important role. Fission will also play a major role while the price of
uranium remains reasonable and in the longer term fast breeder reactors become
accepted. The fact is that it is incredibly hard to meet expected energy demand
with constraints on carbon (either introduced by society, or due to the increasing
scarcity of fossil fuels).

Success in developing fusion as an effective large-scale source of power on earth
is not guaranteed. However, given the magnitude of the energy challenge, and the
relatively small investment that is needed on the (approx. $5 trillion per annum)
scale of the energy market, accelerated/fast track development of fusion is fully
justified in view of its enormous potential. With so few other options available to
provide the world’s power as the availability (and willingness to use) fossil fuels
decreases, we cannot afford not to develop fusion power. Fortunately, it appears
to be within our reach.
