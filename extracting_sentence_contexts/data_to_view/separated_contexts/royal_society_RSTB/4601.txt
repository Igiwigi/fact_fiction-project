viz., daily and seasonal, The size of the changes that take place within so short a
time as 24 hours is perhaps the most surprising fact that the experiment has
revealed. Thus the three consecutive samples 246, 247 and 248 give 58°0, 14°25

and 26°25 million bacteria respectively. The changes exhibited by any of the
species of protozoa are at times even larger, and affect the active and encysted
stages apparently quite indifferently.
