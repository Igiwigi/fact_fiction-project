Previous studies have shown that polyethylene
glycol is resistant to adsorption of proteins; for example, Jiang et al. (2004)
demonstrated that self-assembled monolayers containing oligo(ethyleneglycol)-
terminated alkanethiols resist adhesion of mammalian cells as well as non-specific
adsorption of proteins; in their study, self-assembled monolayers containing
oligo(ethyleneglycol)-terminated alkanethiols on palladium were shown to remain
inert for at least four weeks. Seigel et al. (1997) utilized an acoustic plate-
mode sensor in order to demonstrate that hexa(ethylene glycol)-terminatec
self-assembled monolayers demonstrate very low protein adsorption. Wang
et al. (1997) suggested that oligo(ethylene glycol)-terminated self-assemblec
monolayers resist proteins and other biological molecules owing to the fact tha
these molecules form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. It is believed tha
a stable interfacial layer of water molecules inhibits protein-surface contact anc
prevents protein adsorption; as such, this process is considered to be enthalpic
instead of entropic. These antifouling properties are appealing for implantable
devices, since protein fouling and cell adhesion can impede transport of biological!
molecules between the device and the surrounding tissues.
