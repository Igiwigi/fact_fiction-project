8eparate elements of the forming tooth are united into a coherent mass, the yacuities
between them constituting the cavities and tubes of the matured tissue. Though the
interstitial nature of the tubes, lacunze, and canaliculi was pointed out by QuEkevr, and
in this much Professor WILLIAMSON was anticipated by him, still the method by which
this character of the tissue is produced had never been before described.

Professor WILLIAMSON was, however, quite wrong in some important, points, both in
the anatomy and anatomical relationship of the soldering particles. He asserts that
they are free, that they are unconnected with each other, and that they never become

Qanchylosed to one another: in all three particulars he is mistaken.

A The soldering particles are always attached firmly, and in fact united to the elements
