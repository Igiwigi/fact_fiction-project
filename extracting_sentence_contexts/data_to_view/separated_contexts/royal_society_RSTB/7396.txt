In
this connexion it is necessary to consider the distribution of the terms for tobacco and
tobacco pipes. NATIVE NAMES FOR TOBACCO

I have dealt as fully as is at present possible with the native names for tobacco and
pipes in New Guinea (pp. 244-54); here I give a summary. Broadly speaking, the main facts that emerge are that there are very numerous un-
related and usually very local native terms for tobacco among the mountain peoples of
the central main ranges. Most of these peoples are static communities. Among the
other peoples of the mountainous interior to a certain extent the same holds good, but
for these there frequently have been large or small movements which have extended
their local terms for tobacco.
