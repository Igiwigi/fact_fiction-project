The same results are also shown graphically in Plate 68, fig. 59, where the full
are the curves for ordinary temperature, and the dotted lines are for 100? C. Both wit]
the annealed and hardened specimen the 100* C. curyes hie at first higher and
lower than the normal curves. The crossing points, at which the effect of this difference
of temperature on magnetic susceptibility becomes reyersed, occur at values of IJ far
higher than the critical value in the former method of experiment. This difference is
partly, perhaps, to be ascribed to the fact that here we are dealing with induced
magnetism, whereas in the former case the magnetism dealt with was chiefly residual ;
but the principal reason for the very much higher values of J required to be reached
here before the effects become reversed is no doubt the hysteresis which exists in the
relation of magnetisation to magnetising force. The difference in the results of the
two methods is analogous to that which is found when we determine the Viurar
critical point for stress (1) by loading and unloading, (2) by magnetising under
constant loads (cf. $ 107).

$121. The range through which magnetism was altered by heating and cooling in
the experiment, of F 116, and others like it, was 80 small that I considered it desirable
to see whether an increased range of temperature variation would nob afford evidence
of hysteresis in the relation of magnetism to temperature. With this view, the effect
