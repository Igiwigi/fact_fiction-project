21 (cf outlines A and B, fig. 89). In the upper fourth (fig. 22) the nuclei
are less crowded, and the cytoplasm more vacuolated than in the lower three-fourths
(fig. 23); it may be inferred that the upper end of the sac increases in length more
rapidly than the rest. This is also indicated by the fact that, while the antipodal end
still lies free in the products of decomposition of the nucellar cells, the micropylar apex
has pushed its way into the midst of nucellar tissue whose continuity remains
unbroken, These changes and those which immediately follow them are effected with
great rapidity and stages intermediate between those of figs. 21 and 22, 23 have
rarely been seen; while they are in progress the whole sac is exceedingly liable to
contraction during preparation: As in the sac of fig. 21, so in that of figs, 22, 23, the
nuclei themselves are alike in all visible characters; in intermediate stages, those of
the apical fourth show a somewhat greater avidity for stains than the rest, but this
difference persists only for a short time.
