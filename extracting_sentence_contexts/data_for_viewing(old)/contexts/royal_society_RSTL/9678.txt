MR. R, C. ROWE ON ABEI'S THEOREM, 731

Secrion IT.

12, The expression (in a form algebraic or logarithmic) of the xum SſXda having
been shown to exist, and having in fact been found, ABEL proceeds, in his art. 5, to
investigate the condition that this expression should become a constant. Of the pos-
sibility of this we have been assured by the result of the firs} example and of the first
case of the second example of art. 11. This investigation, as subordinate to the main
purpose, may be conyeniently postponed to the second principal inquiry with which
the memoir is concerned.

This inquiry presents itself in two forms.

I. Mention was made at the outset of the *requisite algebraical laws ” which
connect the variables when the summation desired can be effected. And in the case
of the elliptic functions we have found that in order to express the sum of three func-
tions i is requisite that the variables should be connected by a single relation. We
