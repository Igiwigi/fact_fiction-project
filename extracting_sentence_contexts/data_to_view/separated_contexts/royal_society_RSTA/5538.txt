The first point to decide was at what temperature viscosities should be compared. RETWEEN THE VISCOSITY OF LIQUIDS AND THRIR CHAMICAL NATURE. 587

Tn the past, owing to the fact that the temperature variation has been little studied,
it has been customary te employ one and the same temperature for all substances,

The kind of relationships which are obtained by such a system of comparison have
aleendy been indicated in connection with the graphionl representation of our obser
vations, We have thought it needless to say anything fivtler regarding this
method, for, na has been shown, the viseosily onrves, even in the sane fimily of
enhstunees eross ond another, so that quantitative relationships obtained of any singly
temperalure of comparison can have no prefensions to generality, bat must vary
with the value of the partioular temperature selected,

The first comparable temperature which suggested itself was the boiling-point, and
the detailed exominalion of viscosity at the boiling-point is first set ont, With snok
date a8 could be obtained relating to critical temperatures, we then calculated yalues
of cotresponding temperatures by the method indieated by yaw pen Waats, Tho
particular temperature adopted (4) was sneh that it inoluded the greatest munber of
eases. A very brief summary of the vesolts obtained ab
