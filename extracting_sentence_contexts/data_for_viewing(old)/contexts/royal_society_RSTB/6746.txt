Dr K. S. Sandford (1935, p. 361) has found a rock which has a similar appearance
under the microscope, but its occurrence as a thin selvedge on the edge of a crater
blown through the Nubian sandstone seems to preclude any possibility of the two
rocks having a similar origin. Whatever the interpretation of this curious rock,* the

fact remains that it occurs at the foot of the Lorumel-Signal Hill escarpment at the
crest of a fold which causes the grits to dip eastward beneath the Pleistocene lake
deposits.

North of this point the fold is not apparent, for the foot of the escarpment is formed
of rocks of the Basement Complex. That this should be the case is not surprising, since
the foliation of the metamorphic rocks throughout this region gives axes running
nearly north to south. Therefore any later folding having similarly directed axes would
result only in accentuation of the pre-existing structure without being individually
recognizable.

In view of the evidence of folding in the Signal Hill region and in the Lodwar(?) and
Losidok Hills, and other areas yet to be described, I find it difficult to account for the
