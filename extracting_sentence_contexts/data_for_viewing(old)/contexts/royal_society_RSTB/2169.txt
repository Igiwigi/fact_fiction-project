OF MOLLUSCA AND DECAPOD CRUSTACEA. 7

all the Decapod Crustacea is granular and coloured. This is the case not only among
sea-water, but also in fresh-water forms such as Astacus fluviatilis and Palemonetes
varians. The colour of the mass in the ferment cell is a bright or dark brown, and
correspondingly the gland and its secretion are coloured, or it may be a rusty-brown or
bright yellow. But even in the same species the colour may vary without assignable
cause. Normally, this coloured mass in the ferment cell is finely granular, and the
granules may be collected into secondary spherical masses within the primary one,
e.g.,in Maja. FRenzet describes departures from the typical appearance of these
cells, which no doubt are due to the fact that we cannot draw hard and fast lines
between the two kinds of cells. Indeed, as Lane in his “ Comparative Anatomy”
remarks : “ We cannot also carry out a sharp distinction of the cells into ferment
cells and hepatic cells ; many transition forms occur.”

FreNzEL found crystals in the vesicles of the ferment cells in some Decapods,
notably in Maja and Carcinus, also in Callianassa, Squilla mantis, and Dromia.
These crystals were colourless and needle-shaped. He believed they consisted of
tyrosin, pointing out, as he remarks, another point of resemblance between the
gastric gland of Crustacea and the vertebrate pancreas, since the latter contains
tyrosin in its secretion. In one case crystals of an unknown nature were found, of a
cubic shape and of a brownish colour. They occurred in Dromia.
