more vulnerable to attack than seem most of the problems of terrestrial magnetism.
But in spite of their success, and of the contributions of subsequent writers, the
comprehensive study of the subject has suffered undeserved neglect. It seems an
unfortunate fact that the efforts of magneticians are unduly devoted to the accumu-
lation of data, the time and labour spent in their discussion being, i po glee
inconsiderable,

The promising theory that the daily magnetic variations arise mainly from electric
currents circulating in the upper atmosphere, under the impulsion of electromotive
forces produced by the convective motion of the air across the earth’s permanent
magnetic field, was first propounded by Batrour Srewarr.* In a simple but
penetrating discussion of the features both of the solar and lunar diurnal variations,
he showed the power of this theory to account for the facts in a way which none of
the other theories then current could do,

The theory was greatly developed, and rendered more definite, in two important
memoirs by ScuusTeR in 1889 and 1907.+ Adopting a suggestion by Gauss, he
applied the method of spherical harmonic analysis to the solar diurnal magnetic
variations, to determine whether they had their origin mainly above or below the

He made considerable use of BRoun’s admirable study of the lunar diurnal variation of declination at
Trevandrum (1874).
