its value is usually constant for, and characteristic of, normal cells of a particular type,
but also because it enables an estimate to be made of the extent to which other proteins
enter into the composition of various cell nuclei. For this purpose it is also necessary to

know the nucleic acid content, a fairly accurate value for which can be calculated from
a phosphorus determination on the lipid-free, dry nuclei. It was, in fact, by this method,
combined with the demonstration of the presence in nuclei of the protein chromosomin,
that we were able to show (Stedman & Stedman 1943) that cell nuclei, which had
formerly been thought to be composed entirely of histone (or protamin) nucleate (see
Stedman & Stedman 1947a) were, in fact, more complex and contained three main
components: nucleic acid, basic protein and chromosomin. As pointed out by Schmitt
(1944) at the time, this result was in direct conflict with the work of Mirsky & Pollister
(1942, 1943), who adhered to the classical view of the composition of cell nuclei. Mirsky &
Pollister (1947) and Mirsky & Ris (1948) have, however, since confirmed the presence
of chromosomin in cell nuclei. Nevertheless, they still maintain that the nuclei of calf
thymocytes contain over 90 % of histone nucleate. This conclusion is in such direct
conflict with our results that it is necessary to consider the basis of their claim.

In their more recent work, Mirsky & Ris (1948) use material which they describe as
‘chromosomes’. We do not share their view of the nature of this material. It contains, it
is true, threadlike structures, but these are unlike any known chromosomes. Moreover,
according to Calvet, Siegel & Stern (1948), who have made an electron microscopic
