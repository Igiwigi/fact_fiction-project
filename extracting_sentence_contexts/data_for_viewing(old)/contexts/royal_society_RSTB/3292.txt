the bundles does not hold good ; in fact, with the exception of A. Rulez, the canals
are seldom met with under the veins.

A noteworthy characteristic of the genus is the rich development of transfusion
tracheids (centripetal xylem); as this tissue has already been described by more
than one author, we do not propose to deal with it in detail. Reference may be
made to the papers of WorspeLL and Brrnarp,* and especially to the figures

to the abundance of wax in the stomatal depressions, the arrangement of the stomata
in irregular and occasionally discontinuous rows is clearly seen by examining dry
leaves under a lens. In Araucaria imbricata stomata are abundant on both faces
