for example, the alloys Au,Al and AuAl, have only one freezing point.

It is important to bear in mind that the diagrams of Curves 2 and 5 give a record of
all the freezing points observed, and contain more information than an ordinary
equilibrium curve. The first, or upper, freezing points of each alloy do indeed
constitute an equilibrium curve, but our lines of second and third freezing points
do not, strictly speaking, belong to the equilibrium curve. For example, the second
freezing point which we mentioned as occurring at 625째 does not represent a state
in which a liquid having the composition Au;)Aljo is in equilibrium with solid. For in
the solidification of this alloy the liquid part of the matter in our crucible has, ever
since the first freezing point at 850째, been getting richer and richer in gold, until
when the freezing point at 625째 is reached the matter still liquid is of the composition
AusAl,, or thereabouts. In fact all the freezing points on the horizontal line through
G are points of equilibrium between this same liquid and a certain solid, In an equili-
brium curve as usually drawn all these freezing points would be represented by the
point G. The other lines of second and third freezing points have a similar meaning.

We will now briefly discuss the singularities in the curve.* From A, the freezing
point of pure gold, to B, the curve is nearly a straight line. The freezing points of
the very dilute solutions are, as usual, very steady temperatures, but as we approach
B the upper freezing point is indicated by a slight pause only in the cooling, and lower
second freezing points become well marked. These are all at about 545째, and are very
