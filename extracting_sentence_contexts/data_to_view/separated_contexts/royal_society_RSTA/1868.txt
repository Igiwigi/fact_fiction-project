For the 3-system we have therefore

s = 3 9 27 81
lr = 0-91 0-69 0-53 0-40

when the same length of wire is used in both coils. If coils of equal inductance are compared, the conditions are different, as the spacing
for stranded wire coils is not the same as that for solid wire coils. In fact, throughout
the range for which spacing is advantageous, *

D = 2d

for the solid wire coils, and for stranded wire coils on the 3-system having the same
copper section,
D = (1-244)? nd. For coils of the same shape and of radius a, the inductance L is proportional to
a'/D? and the length of wire J is proportional to a’/D. Hence, to keep the inductance
constant, /*/D must be constant.
