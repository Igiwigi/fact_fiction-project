It was only in the twentieth century that it was fully recognized that much is to be 2 |
gained from moving in the opposite direction of energy. While particle accelerators got larger

and more powerful in order to push back the frontier of high-energy experiments, it was “3
by cooling that many phenomena in solid-state physics were discovered which account for :8
much of the interest in that field. The liquefaction of helium, and the resulting discoveries of ig
superfluidity and superconductivity a century ago, are representatives for a string of many : gS
important developments. :&

We are now used to, as a matter of course that hardly requires comment, the fact that low- {2

energy degrees of freedom of a system can differ completely from those of its high-energy
constituents. This phenomenon is now known under the name emergence and was formulated

most crisply in Anderson’s manifesto entitled ‘More is different’ [1]. This independence of degrees : &
of freedom across scales is crisply noticed in the case of crystals, whose low-energy excitations— Dos
the phononic lattice vibrations—exhibit bosonic quantum statistics, regardless of the fermionic or : =
bosonic nature of the atoms making up the crystal. : a

The capacity of phase transitions—such as the translational symmetry breaking leading to the 73
phonons in the above example—to generate various types of emergent excitations being well aes
established, it perhaps comes as a surprise that there are not all that many experimental instances 22
