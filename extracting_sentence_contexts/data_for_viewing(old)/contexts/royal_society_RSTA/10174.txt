HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN IN CONTACT WITH HOT SURFACES. 33

The apparatus was then cooled and thoroughly exhausted at the ordinary
temperature. It was again heated to redness, when about 5 cub. centims, of hydrogen
were extracted. Experiments on the absorption of oxygen at red heat gave entirely
negative results.

Summarising now the above results, it is evident that (1) with normal electrolytic
gas the rate of combination is proportional to the pressure of the dry gas, (2) when
an excess of either of the reacting gases is present, the rate is determined mainly by
the partial pressure of the hydrogen, and (3) the catalysing power of the material is,
on the one hand, greatly stimulated by hydrogen, but, on the other hand, diminished
by oxygen. These considerations, together with the fact that the material occludes
hydrogen but not oxygen at red heat, show that its catalytic action must be referred
to its power of occluding hydrogen.

Part I.—Experiments with SILVER.

In selecting silver as the first metallic surface for investigation, we had in view two
considerations, namely (1) the instability of its oxides above 350°,* and (2) its
relationship to sodium and copper, which suggest the possibility of its forming a
hydride at high temperatures.t For most of the experiments, the metal was
employed in the form of a gauze of 23 strands per centimetre, each strand having a
diameter of 0°18 millim.;{ a final series of experiments was, however, made with foil
prepared from “assay” silver.
