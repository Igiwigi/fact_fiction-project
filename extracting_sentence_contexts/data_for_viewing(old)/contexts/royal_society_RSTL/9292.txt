Patella fuegiensis, Reeve, Conchol. Teonica, viii., 8p. 78.

The description given by Reeve is very good, but he does not lay sufficient stress
upon the beautiful raised concentric ridges. He calls them strize, which term
scarcely gives the idea of thread-like lirations such as these. They are very closely
packed and undulate yery prettily on and between the numerous radiating ribs.

The figure, except in outline and the position of the apex, gives but a poor idea
of this beautifully sculptured Patella. Tt represents the number of ribs at about
forty, whereas there are usually about sixty. The specimens from Kerguelen's
Island are a trifle narrower and much more depressed than examples from the
Falkland Islands ; in fact, it is only near the apex that they are at all raised, and
towards the margin they are up-turned, s0 that the dorsal surface is concave, and
this form of the shell certainly prevents the animal from entirely concealing itself
when adhering to a flat surface. But this peculiarity of form only exists in adult
8pecimens, for seyeral small ones are like ordinary species in this respect. The
radiating ribs are almost obsolete in the flat examples, but the undulating concentric
lirations, which are more prominent ' and farther apart than in the type form of
the species, define their position ; in young shells they are more pronounced.
Colour generally uniformly purplish slate, with the apical region ferrugineous ;
interior similarly tinted, hut rather more deeply. One shell has a white border.
They are all very thin and fragile, and the edge is very liable to break off in a line
with the concentric raised lines of growth.
