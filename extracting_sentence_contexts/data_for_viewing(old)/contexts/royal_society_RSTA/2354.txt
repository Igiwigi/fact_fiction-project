through the pj(@), ie. the posterior joint-PDF of the elastic parameters. The same lognormal
distribution considered for the compressive strength in C2 was employed to build the term
Pj(F|@). Finally, C4, represented by the dash-dotted blue line in figure 17, does not account for
the natural period experimental measurement. Its fragility curve was evaluated considering the
prior joint-PDF of the elastic parameters (po(0)) reported in figure 6. The term P;(F|@) accounts for
the variability of the compressive strength, and the same lognormal PDF employed for case C2
and C3 was selected for comparative purposes.

Comparing the C4 fragility curve with others, it is possible to observe that the median collapse
value is not maintained. This is due to the fact that the prior joint-PDF of the elastic parameters
has a different median value compared with the posterior joint-PDF (figure 7). Moreover, the
dispersion of the collapse fragility curves increases from C1 to C4. This variability is a result of
the role played by the different sources of uncertainties on the seismic vulnerability of masonry
towers, as well as the different approaches employed to define it. Some considerations can
be drawn from the seismic vulnerability of the four cases considered, from the observation
of the fragility curves reported in figure 17. In terms of PGA, the probability of failure P7(F)
corresponding to the 5th percentile, varies from 0.19g to 0.36g for C4 and C1, respectively.
Intermediate PGA levels are obtained in the C3 (0.26 g) and C2 (0.30 g) cases.

5. Conclusion

A methodology was proposed, which incorporates both modelling and measurement
