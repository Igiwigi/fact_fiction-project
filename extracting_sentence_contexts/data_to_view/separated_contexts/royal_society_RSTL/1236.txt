Marcet on the specific gravity and temperature

general law, or to explain the phenomena by particular theo-
ries.* Why, for instance, two neighbouring and'almost
contiguous/portions of the ocean, placed nearly alike in regard
to solar influence, should differ s0 widely in the temperature
of their waters, the warmer strata being, in one case, found
lying above the colder, while in the other that order is re-
versed, appears perfectly unaccountable. Whether, also, this
singular circumstance may lead to inferences bearing upon
the question now at issue respecting a north-west passage, I
shall not presume to. decide. But I may be allowed to:indulge
a hope, that the facts collected-in this paper, may assist fu-
ture inquirers in forming more accurate views of those grand
phenomena of nature, in which the navigation of certain seas,
the vicissitudes of seasons, 'and the geological history of the
globe are s0 essentially concerned ; or that they may at least
be the means of inducing other and abler observers to turn
their attention to this interesting subject.

* Count RumrorD, in one of his Philosophical Essays (Vol. IT, Essay VIT.), in
endeayouring to trace this clas of natural phenomena to final causes, was led to ome
speculations and generalizations on the comparative temperature of the seas, and of
large lakes, at their surface and at different depths, and on the relation which these
temperatures bear to climate and to human comfort, which, however hypothetical,
possess considerable plausibility and interest. Count Rumrory's general idea was
that the uniform temperature of large lakes at great depths, which De SaussURE
found in the Swiss lakes to be constantly between 41% and 422, was naturally ex-
plained from the circumstance since discovered, of water possessing its greatest den-
Sity at about that temperature z- and he conceived that the object of this lawof nature
was to. preserve in winter a store of warmth at the bottom of these lakes, by which
their freezing was retarded at the surface, and altogether prevented at a great depth,
thus affording a check to the effects of severe winters.
