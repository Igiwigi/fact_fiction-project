334 DR. MARSHALL HALL ON THE RESPIRATION AND IRRITABILITY.

A particular object which I have in view is to construct accurate Tables of
the quantity of respiration and the degree of irritability, which cannot fail to
have many important applications in physiology. They will especially afford
many explanations of the facts detailed in the extraordinary works of Lecar-
Lois and M. Epwarps, as I slall have occasion to point out particularly
hereafter. The facts in regard to the irritability, ascertained by NysTEN* and
Maxanay, insulated and useless hitherto, will assume a new and high degree
of importance. The law of the inverse ratio which subsists in the animal
kingdom between the respiration and the irritability of the muscular fibre,
which admits of being extended s0-as to include all stimuli, appears to me,
indeed, to constitute a chain which links together all the phenomena of the
animal economy. TI believe it to be the most general and inclusive in phy-
siology.
