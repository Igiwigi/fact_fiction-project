rods and a connecting wire were employed to form the relieving system. Hence, if at
a point of the tube we obtain by any process an effect on the sensitive luminous column,
we can at once ascertain whether it belongs to the category of relief-effects or not. If
ib does not, there must exist some foreign element other than the mere facility for
granting electrical relief in the influences brought to bear upon the tube. We now
proceed to examine these special or non-relief effects.

V.â€”0On the spectal or non-relief effects produced on the sensitive luminous discharge
by conneeting it with the air-spark terminal.

In the present section we shall at firs; sappose the intermittence to be caused by
an interruption in the circuit between the source of electricity and the positive
terminal of the tube. For convenience we shall express this fact by calling the
positive terminal the arr-spark terminal.

If we connect a wire with a piece of tinfoil placed upon the tube, and connect the
wire with any independent conducting system, we shall obtain, as we have seen, more
or less complete forms of the relief-effect. Both the wire and tinfoil will, in the
majority of cases, repel the luminous column. But if the wire be connected with the
positive terminal a sndden change takes place in the phenomenon. Tnstead of the
luminous column being repelled by the wire, the course of the latter along the tube
(snpposing it partly to rest upon the tube) will be marked by a bright line of lumi-
nosity on the inner 8urface of the glass as though it had attracted the luminous column
instead of repelling it. And the effect of the presence of the tinfoil is changed in a no
less remarkable manner. Tnstead of the former repulsion, a tongue of luminosity will
