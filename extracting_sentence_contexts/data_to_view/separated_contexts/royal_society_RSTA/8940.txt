Art. 6. The importance of this expansion lies in the fact that the infinite series of
Hammond operators on the one hand and the infinite series of Q functions on the
other hand have very remarkable properties in relation to one another. The first
property we notice is that from the well-known law of operation,

D,,@ = Q,

D,,Q, = Q:, or zero,

for all values of m. Also

ascending as m is, or is not, a multiple of two.
