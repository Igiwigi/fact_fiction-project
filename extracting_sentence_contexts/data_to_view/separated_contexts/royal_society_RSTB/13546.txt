Thus the original variance
one paper in this special issue develops newly detailed ratio approach, whereby patterns of species’ synchronous or
frequency-specific descriptions of a kind of synchrony, and compensatory dynamics are assessed using covariance tools
then uses them to make new inferences about musical and and then related to community variability measured using a
rhythmic behaviour in humans [37]. The examples of [38] coefficient of variation, is probably inadequate, by itself. Species
