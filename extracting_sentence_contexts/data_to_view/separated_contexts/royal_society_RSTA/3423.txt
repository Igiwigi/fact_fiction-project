This late-middle-age 25Mo star will thus be just as bright visually
as an zero-age main-sequence 60Mg (O3 V) star! Since 25Mo stars are significantly more common
than those of 60Mo, we expect these stars to dominate in any magnitude-limited sample. Indeed,
this fact is cited by Massey et al. [7] as the reason that the highest mass stars are conspicuously
absent in the H-R diagram shown in figure 1. However, there is a far larger problem revealed by figure 1. We have so far identified only 64
O-type stars in M31, and 130 in M33 [7].
