Compare art 11, equation (16).

52, The foregoing equation can be got directly as follows, my object in giving the
above method being to show the identity of the methods of spherical geometry, and the
method of conics given in the * Bicirculars;” and in fact it was geometrically, that is, from
consideration of the sphere, that I first discovered the method given in the * Bicirculars.”

Let 7 be the radius and A, j, » the direction-angles of the axis of the orthogonal circle;
then, from the condition 1—R=0 (se art. 47), we get three equations,

cos g' C08 T— C08 A c08 « — C08 pu cos 3' — cos vcosy =0,
cos g' cos 7— C08 A cos x" — cos. cos 3” — cos v cos y =0,
cos eg” cos T—Co8 A cos «"'— cos cos B” — cosy cos y"=0;
and the required circles give us a fourth equation,
S' cos 7— cosa(4)— cos p(y)— cos »(2)=0.
Hence, eliminating linearly, we get the same determinant as before.
Cor. The equations of the three other J's are got from the equation (54) by putting
