The
ridge extending from the inferior and posterior angle forwards upon the under surface
of the scapula, is relatively stronger in the Megatherium, and gives to the homologue
of the inferior costa in the Sloth's blade-bone the character of a second spine. As 8uch
*8econd spine,' with a prolongation of the scapula below, characterizes that bone in the
Anteaters, this indication of affinity to Myrmecophaga, or rather manifestation of the
more general characters of the order Bruta, by the Megatherium, is not without interest.

© Clavicle.—Before the discovery of the Megatherium, Man was usually cited in Manuals
of Comparative Anatomy as the largest animal possessing a * collar-bone”: he is; in fact,
- the largest existing animal 80 endowed. But whilst the length of the human clavicle
- averages but 6 inches, that of the Megatherium is 15 inches. In its general shape and *
- 8igmoid curve, this bone (Plate XX. tig. 1) singularly resembles the human clavicle,
- but is thicker in proportion to its length.
