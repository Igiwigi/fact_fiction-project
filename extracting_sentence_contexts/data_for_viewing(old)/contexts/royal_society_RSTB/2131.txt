612 MR. FRANCIS DARWIN ON STOMATA.

that darkness may increase the turgor of the epidermis and diminish that of the
guard cells. If this were so the increased epidermic pressure and the falling turgor
of the guard cells would act together. Such a method of closure would, however,
not be of the type formulated by Lerrex, since it would be due to concerted action
of the parts, not to the victory of the epidermis over the guard cells.

We have next to enquire what evidence there is as to the interaction of the two
parts of the machine at night. ScHArer* has sought to show that the guard cells
are autonomous by proving that stomata, freed by incision from surrounding pressure,
do not open if they have been previously closed by darkness. I think this argument
is just, although the facts do not seem to me precisely as ScHArer finds. Thus T
have found slight opening in Trop@olumt when the darkened leaf is severed from
the plant ; the amount of opening is not perceptible with the horn hygroscope, but
clearly affects the Yucca instrument. This is of no particular importance, since it is
certainly true that the stomata open less easily in the dark, What is of importance
is that in the early morning the stomata open when the leaf is cut, whereas they do
not do so in the evening. If Lerrersâ€™s were the true explanation they ought to open
in the evening; for if the nocturnal closure were due to epidermal pressure, the
relief of pressure should allow the guard cells to recover their diurnal positions.
Again, Lerrees would necessarily assume that the morning opening is due to
diminished epidermal pressure, and this should, therefore, not be the time for an effect
to be produced by severing the leaf.
