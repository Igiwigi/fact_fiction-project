R. H. BURNE ON SOME PECULIARITIES OF THE

character. â€˜Their walls are in fact remarkable only for the relatively slight development
of all their constituent elements. It is therefore difficult to suggest any function for
this rete, beyond that of a reservoir within which blood can be stored in sufficient quantity
to make the supply to the kidney constant and independent of any fluctuations there
may be in the flow within the lower lateral cutaneous artery ; the flow in this artery
would apparently depend largely on the condition of the outflow from the supra-hepatic
rete, which, as will be suggested below, is probably of a variable character. The peculiar arrangement of the deep branches of the lateral cutaneous artery, in a
mass of fine parallel vessels of somewhat remarkable structure (Plate 10, fig. 6), seems
to be in some way connected with the semi-independence of the column of trunk muscles
that they supply.
