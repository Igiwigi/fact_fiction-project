This self-recording arrangement, though at first sight simple enongh, inyolves points
which have rendered its snccessful completion a somewhat lengthy and difficult matter. Thanks, however, to the skill of Mr. Cnaries JorDax, of Manchester, these mechanical
difficulties have now been overcome, and the instrument perfectly answers the desired
end. |

Owing, in the first place, to the great variations which occur in the chemical inten- |
sity of total daylight in different places, at different times of the day, and in different
periods of the year, and, secondly, owing to the fact that, in order to be able accurately
to estimate chemical intensity, the coloration acquired by the paper must' reach, but
not much exceed, a given tint, it becomes necessary, on each occasion when an obser-
vation is needed, that the sensitive paper should be exposed mechanically, not once, but
for several known but varying intervals of time, quickly succeeding each other; $0 that
whatever may be the intensity of the total daylight (supposed during those intervals to
remain constant), s0me one at least of the several exposed papers will possess the requi-
site shade. This is accomplished by a duplicate arrangement of a clock and insolation-
apparatus. The clock has connected with its minute-wheel (Plate L. fig.
