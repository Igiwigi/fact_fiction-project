sidered, and connected with that very remarkable one, the voluntary power of pro-
ducing heat possessed by the Bee, must lead us to conclude, that although, doubt-
less, the whole of the functions of the body are more or less remotely concerned in

| the production of heat, yet that the immediate source of its evolution scems to. be
chemical changes effected during respiration, and that the neryous system is only
secondarily concerned.

APPENDIX.

Since the preceding paper on the Temperature of Insects was submitted to the Royal Society, circumstances
have enabled me to ascertain a few additional facts respecting the temperature of zome other species which I
had not heretofore any opportunity of examining, and these the Council have kindly permitted me to 8ubjoin
to my paper.

T am not aware that the temperature of the nest of the common wasp has ever before been examined, and it
is therefore pleasing to find that all the circumstances connected with the evolution of heat in the next of this
species are in perfect accordance with the observations made on the neighbouring families of hive and hum-
ble bees.

On the 11th of August, during the past xummer (1837), I dug away the soil from the top of a nest of Vespa
vulgaris which was situated in a bank of earth at the depth of about seven inches from the surface, The nest
was nine inches in diameter, 80 that the colony was by no means a «mall one. The temperature of the atmo-
sphere, when the covering of the nest was removed, at 44 y.x. was 70” Fang, When the thermometer was
