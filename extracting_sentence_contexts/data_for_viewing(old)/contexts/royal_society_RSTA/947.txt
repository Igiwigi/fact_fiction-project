It will follow for all t € (tk, th1) (with factor 7 instead of 6) from the propagation estimates of §4c,
as the velocities ic, are nearly constant in (f;, th41)- a

Thus, when at time f; cluster Cz separates from cluster C1, their relative kinetic energy is not
negligible, compared to the internal energy of the cluster D. This fact will be used in lemma 4.5,
concerning the motion of the messenger cluster. Although the scheme ...— A(t) > A(ths1) >

As §§4b,c consider the situation where the cluster centres of C7 and C; (or C3) are initially very
