Remarks on. Table I.

Tt will be seen from the above table that the specific resistance of iron is more
increased by a given amount of elongation than that of any of the other metals, and
that the specific resistance of aluminium is actually decreased by stress in the line of
flow of the current ; this latter fact being signified by a minus 8ign placed opposite
alumininm in the sixth column. It is also remarkable that the valne of z for the alloys, platinum-silver, German-

slver and brass 8should be considerably less than that of their components ; and this
cireumstance, taken in connexion with the comparatively large increase of resistance of
iron, would suggest that there is ome relation between increase of electrical resistance
caused by rise of temperature and that due to mechanical stress. * Tron (2), iron (3), steel (1), steel (2), and brass (2) were tested some years ago by a method similar to
the one here described,
