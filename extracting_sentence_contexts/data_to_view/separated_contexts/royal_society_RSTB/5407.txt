Theoretical Considerations. (a) Affinities of Asterochlenopsis.â€”From the foregoing description the affinities of the
Siberian Zygopterid with Asterochlana on the one hand and with the Australian Zygop-
terid on the other will have become apparent. But in spite of the clear resemblances with
both these plants, it is evident, in view of the new facts brought to light, that it is
generically distinct from either of them. The affinity with Asterochlena is on the whole
closer than with the Australian plant, in spite of the form of the petiolar bundle. Asterochlenopsis thus seems to be an appropriate name for the new genus.
