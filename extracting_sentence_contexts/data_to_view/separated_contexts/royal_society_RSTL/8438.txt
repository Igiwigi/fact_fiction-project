Tts existence rests on the evidence of Benares and
Tacknow given in the Tables, with that of Bareilly, Goruckpore, and Fyzabad (each for four years). The
ia January temperatures of theso latter stations are respectively 5794, 60%1, and 60*5, which, reduced to 8ea-
level yalues, are 59*, 60*8, and 61%5, There are, however, independent grounds for regarding as probabl

winds prevail on the southern slopes of the Himalaya throughout the cold-weather months, might lead us to
