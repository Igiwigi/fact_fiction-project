where h is the hour of the solar day, P the mean period of a lunation in mean solar
days, and Â¢ the age of the moon in mean solar days ; and f,.(/), f.a(/), are the observed
variations at new moon and when the moon has the age one-eighth of a lunation
respectively. It will presently be seen that, though the typical variations {f(h)} of
one season differ from those of another, this hypothesis holds good generally in each
quarter of the year separately. Of the two characteristics of the curves that pointed in the direction of the formula,
the first was the general fact that the great movements occur in them, as in curves of
the mean solar diurnal variations for full lunations, in the solar day howrs, and the
night hours are relatively quiescent; or, viewed in another aspect, the significant
movements occur at all hours of the lunar day in the course of a lunation, and appear
earlier and earlier as the age of the moon increases. And the second characteristic
was that the curves, regarded as solar diurnal curves, have generally the same form
and range at intervals of half a lunation, and opposite forms at intervals of a quarter
of a lunation ; and this with reference separately to each of the two magnetic elements
and to each season of the year. [7a.
