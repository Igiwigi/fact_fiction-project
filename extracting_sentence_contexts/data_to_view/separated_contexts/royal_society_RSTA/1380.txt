Delongâ€™s test, used to compare whether each : =
pair of AUC are different, provided a p-value higher than 0.06, meaning that although the 8
algorithms behave differently for each threshold, their performances are in agreement globally : 4
(at the 95% CL). 1

The final test was the study of the correlation between the diameter of the aneurysm and the : Ss
increase of uptake between the aneurysm and the normal aorta. Previous studies have reported : Ss
non-significant correlation at the 95% CL [4,6] using OSEM+G, and this work is in agreement with 13

these findings as reported in figure 7. In fact, the correlation is not significant for OSEM+G and
KEM at the 95% CL. For HKEM, in contrast, the two variables are significantly correlated with a
p-value of 0.045. The correlation is nevertheless moderate with a coefficient of 0.28.
