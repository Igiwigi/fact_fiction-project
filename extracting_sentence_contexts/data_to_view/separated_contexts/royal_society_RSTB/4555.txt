In company with
the laryngeal nerves and the tracheal vein, it passes up the side of the
trachea, to which it sends small twigs, finally breaking up in the larynx. It
gives off a number of branches (I-VI). The interest of this vessel lies in the fact that it is undoubtedly homologous with
the arteria cesophagea of Triton, Salamandra, and Spelerpes as described by
Bernee(11). In these Urodela the respiration is carried on not only by the skin
and lungs, but also by the mucosa of the buccal cavity and pharynx. Indeed, in
Speleropes, where the lungs have been completely suppressed, it is performed entirely
by the skin and the mucosa in these regions.
