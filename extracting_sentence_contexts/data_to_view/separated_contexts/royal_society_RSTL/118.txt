on the Floor touching him who rubs the Globe
with his Hands ſtanding upon Wax, without at
the ſame time ſome other Non-lectric ſupported
by Originally-Electrics, or otherwiſe being in Con-
ract with the Globe, is owing to whateyer Part of
this Man's natural Quantity of Electricity, taken
from himſelf by the Globe in Motion, being tc-
ſtored. to him again by the Globe in its Reyolu-
tions; there not being any other Non-electric
near enough to communicate the Electricity to;
and that therefore, in-this Situation, the Electri-
city of this Man ſuffers no Diminution of its
Denſity.

7. That the Fact is otherwiſe, when every thing elſe
being as before, either a Gun-barrel ſuſpended
in ſilk Lines; or a Man ſupported by Wax, or
ſuch-like, is placed near the; Globe in Motion ;
becauſe then, whatever" Part of the -Eledricity
of the' Perſon rubbing is taken from him; is.com-
municated' cither to the other Man or to; the Gun-
barrel, theſe, from their. Situation, being the firſt
Non-electrics, to which the Electricity taken from
the Perſon rubbing can be communicated.

$. That, under theſe Circumſtances, as much Elec-
tricity as is taken from the Perſon rubbing, is
given to the other; by which means the Electri-
city of the firſt Man is more rare than it natu-
rally was, and that of the laſt more denſe.
