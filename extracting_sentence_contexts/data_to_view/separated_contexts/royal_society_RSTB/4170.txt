Further, there is good presumption for a view that the
so-called optimum temperature for growth is due to the balance of this toxin
formation against growth acceleration in all plants. The phenomenon is conspicuously
displayed by the growing stems of cotton plants in Egypt on excessively hot days. For convenience in reference it has been designated Thermotoxy,t and its possible
bearing on the facts ascertained in this investigation will be discussed subsequently. Apart from this effect the rate of growth of a seedling root or stem, as manifested
above in the germination tests, increases about 1째9 times for every 10째 C. rise in the
temperature. It is not necessary for the moment to enter into details with regard to soil
temperature, which will be given later (p. 444), except to state that the change in the
mean temperature of the seed-bed is from about 14째 C. in mid-February to about
23째 C. in mid-April.
