The groove separating in 4-day Larus the anterior (interventral) and posterior
(basiventral) divisions of the atlas and axis intercentra has disappeared. â€˜The same may
be stated with regard to the histological difference expressed in 4-day Larus and 8-day
Struthio. These facts suggest that both components (inter- and basi-ventral) of the atlas
and axis intercentra have undergone complete fusion. The same can be stated with
regard to 12-day Struthio.
Extracervical Regions. The moniliform differentiation of the notochord of the thoracic region is of special
interest, revealing a transitional stage in the localisation of the dilatations and constric-
tions with respect to the vertebral rings and sclerotomes.
