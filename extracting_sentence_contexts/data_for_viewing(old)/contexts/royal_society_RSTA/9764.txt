accurate measurements of the magnetic rotatory dispersion, were not successful;
although the material contained fewer bubbles than the dises prepared a few years
before, the triple field of the polarimeter could not be seen through the rod, which
gave instead a splendid demonstration of Arry’s spirals.

As contrasted with the exact accordance, throughout the range from 6708 to 4359,
of the two series of dispersion-ratios for quartz, it may be noted that the nearest
approach to equality in a series of 23 alcohols was found in the alcohol phenylmethyl-
carbinol which gave for the ratio 4359/5461

Magnetic 1°739, Optical 1°736.

But the accidental nature of this concordance is clearly shown by the fact that the
next homologue phenylethyl-carbinol gave the values

Magnetic 1°731, Optical 1°674.

10. Summary.

(1) A large crystal of optically perfect levo-quartz has been found which produced
a rotation of 25°°5371 per mm. in light of wave-length 5460°97. Cylinders, also
apparently perfect, cut from a crystal of dextro-quartz, produced a rotation of
25°°5361 per mm. Cylinders cut from plates of dextro- and of levo-quartz which
gave the figure 25°°5338 per mm. were shown to be faulty by a new test, in which
the specimen, mounted between Nicol prisms set to extinction, is examined with
