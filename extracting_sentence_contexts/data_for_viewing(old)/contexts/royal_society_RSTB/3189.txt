correlation with that of the egg, and is due to the steady accumulation of the
acidophile ground substance,

On the completion of yolk formation all indications of nucleolar activity abruptly
cease. The supply of the basophile constituent of the nucleolus also ceases, but the
acidophile constituent continues to be deposited on to the nucleolar surface where,
no longer being incorporated by the now inactive nucleolus, it forms lens-shaped
accumulations.

The selective action shown by the nucleolar material, together with the strict
correlation the growth of this structure shows to that of the egg, excludes the
possibility of this substance being derived directly from a source outside the cell.
The fact that the ground substance continues to be deposited on to the nucleolus
after the completion of all cytoplasmic activity, together with the close relation this
structure shows to the chromatin in earlier stages, points to the latter as its source,
while the failure at the same time of the supply of the basophile constituent
indicates the origin of the latter from the cytoplasm.

The steady growth of the nucleolus is not due to the accumulation of waste
material, but to an increased production of the “ ground substance” by the chromatin
in order to cope with the ever-increasing production of waste material by the
cytoplasm of the growing egg. From the nuéleolus this waste material, now
presumably inert and harmless, is discharged into the cytoplasm, where it slowly
dissolves away.
