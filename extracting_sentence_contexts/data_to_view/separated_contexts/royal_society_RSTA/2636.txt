However, intuition would lead most to believe 7S
that viscous silicic magma volcanoes are less likely to have complicated convection flow patterns —
that would promote degassing because the magma pathways within are often quite narrow. So, —
researchers began to question how this degassing may then take place. Fluid-dynamic evaluations : a
have demonstrated that viscous magma can in fact flow through a conduit measuring 100m : -
in diameter rapidly enough to cause persistent degassing [27,28], but the existence of such a : =
wide magma column at a shallow depth in a silicic volcano was unproven. Therefore, when [4
Shionahara & Tanaka [29] confirmed the presence of a low-density vesiculated magma at a : =
depth of only 100m from the summit crater floor of Satsuma-Iwojima volcano based on the :3
data obtained by Tanaka et al. [5], it helped to explain the dynamics of the degassing process : =

of this particular volcano. It was concluded that Satsuma-Iwojima volcano had conduit magma
convection dynamics occurring within rhyolitic magma inside the cone.
