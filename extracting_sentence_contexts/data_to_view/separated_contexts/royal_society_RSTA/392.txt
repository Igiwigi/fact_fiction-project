However, the temperature change must be
converted to the global mean to allow inference of climate sensitivity. The required scale factor
is commonly extracted from an estimated LGM-—Holocene global temperature change, which,
however, is very uncertain, with estimates ranging from approximately 3°C to approximately
6°C. Thus, for example, the climate sensitivity (1.7-2.6°C for 2 x COz) estimated by Schmittner
et al. [94] is due largely to their assumed approximately 3°C cooling in the LGM, and in lesser part
to the fact that they defined some aerosol changes (dust) to be a climate forcing. Climate sensitivity extracted from Pleistocene climate change is thus inherently partly
subjective as it depends on how much weight is given to mutually inconsistent estimates
of glacial-to-interglacial global temperature change. Our initial assessment is a fast-feedback


sensitivity of 3+1°C for 2 x CO2, corresponding to an LGM cooling of 4.5°C, similar to the
2.2-4.8°C estimate of PALAEOSENS [99].
