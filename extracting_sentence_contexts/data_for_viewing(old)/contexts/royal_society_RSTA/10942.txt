this seems to me very instructive when we consider the statements made by some
writers who theorise about variation rather than actually measure it: The undifferen-
tiated like organs put forth by the individual have in round numbers 80 to 90 per
cent. of the variation of such organs in the race. Does not this completely refute the
views frequently expressed that variation is the result of sexual reproduction, and that
it is quite insignificant in the case of budding? Sexual reproduction may produce a
type which is not that of either parent, but this does not @ fortiori alter the vari-
ability of the race with regard to any organ. With continuous variation such type
would have previously existed as far as any special organ or character is concerned,
and its repetition contributes nothing to the racial variability. We have to meet the
fact that the individual produces undifferentiated like organs with a remarkable
degree of variety, and if the investigations of the present memoir be valid the
practical result of the homotyposis factor having a value of *4 to ‘5 would denote that
the individual variability is 91°65 to 86°60 per cent. of the racial.

(25.) Lastly, we may consider a third point of very great interest, which is
involved in Table XXXIV. Here we have the coefficients of variation given for some
twenty-two series. Now this coeflicient seems to me the only satisfactory comparative
measure we can find at present of variability. A variation of two in the petals of
a buttercup is far more significant than one of two in the florets of an ox-eyed daisy ;
the measures of the absolute variations as given by the standard deviations seem to
me of no use when we are comparing different characters in different species. In
default of the suggestion of any better standard, all we can do is to get rid of absolute
