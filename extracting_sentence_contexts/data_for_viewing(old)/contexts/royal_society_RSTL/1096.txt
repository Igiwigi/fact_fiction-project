that do militate against it, are the metallic characters of some of the sulphurets and
phosphurets of the imperfect metals,

hydrogene, with peculiar unknown bases, and that the oxides,
alkalies, and acids were compounds of the same bases with
water, and that the phaznomena presented by the metals of the
fixed alkalies might be explained on this hypothesis.

The same mode of reasoning may be applied to the facts
of the metallization of the earths and ammonia, and perhaps
with rather stronger evidences in-its favour, but till it will
be less, distinct and simple, than the usually received theory
of oxygenation, which I have applied to them.

The general facts of the combustion, and of the action of
these new combustible substances upon water, are certainly
most easily explained on the hypothesis of Lavotster ; and
the only good arguments in favour of a common principle of
inflammability, flow from some of the novel analogies in
electrochemical science.
