Gapow introduced a series of terms for the different parts of a developing vertebra
in his paper on Pisces (* Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.,’ London, 1895). In a subsequent paper
(* Phil. Trans.,” 1896) he applied those terms in describing the Amphibians, and this is
now recognised as the standard terminology. He, along with Miss ABBor, compared
these terms with those of other authors, so far as they thought the terms synonymous
with their own. It is therefore needless to recapitulate the terminology of the previous
authors.

Some of the parts of a developing vertebra were not known to Gavow, such as the
Dorsointervertebral procartilaginous piece, which becomes divided into the zygapophyses.
Gapow thought that the intervertebral cartilage was divided into two definite pieces,
an interdorsal and an interventral; but, as a matter of fact, no such division exists,
the whole thing being one mass ; so that we have termed it the intervertebral.

Gapow did not observe the connective tissue arches. The upper cartilaginous arch
has been described as basidorsal and the connective tissue arch as the upper connective
tissue arch. Similarly the lower cartilaginous arch has been described as basiventral.
and the connective tissue arch as the lower connective tissue arch.

Observations of Stages.

Stage A. (The embryo is almost spherical.)—This is the first stage in which we can
see the distinet notochord. The neural folds on the two sides are wide apart. The
neural canal is still a curved plate without dorsal protection. Ventral to the neural
