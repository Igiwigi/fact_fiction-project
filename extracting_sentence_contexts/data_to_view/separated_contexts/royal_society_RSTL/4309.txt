'These differences of property which
are preserved amidst the prevailing uniformity of gases, may well be supposed to be
among the most deep-seated and fundamental in their nature with which matter is
endowed. It was under such impressions that I have devoted an amount of time
and attention to the determination of this class of numerical constants, which might
otherwise appear disproportionate to their value and the importance of the subject. As the results, too, were entirely novel, and wholly unprovided for in the received
view of the gaseous constitution, of which indeed they prove the incompleteness, it
was the more necessary to verify eyery fact with the greatest care. Perhaps the most general and simple result which I can offer is, that the transpira-
tion velocity of hydrogen is exactly double that of nitrogen. These gases it will be
remembered have a less simple relation in density, namely 1 to 14.
