In contrast to CO, CHy
can be oxidized catalytically, without the need for capture, in a thermodynamically favourable
reaction: CHy + 202 > CO2 + 2H2O (AH, = —803 kJ mol™!), although such a reaction is difficult
at typical conditions of atmospheric temperature and pressure [29]. Because of methane’s potency
as a greenhouse gas (34 times higher Global Warming Potential (GWP) than CO, on a century
timescale and 86 times higher on a 20-year timescale, [30]), considerably less methane removal is
needed to realize the same climate impact. In fact, methane concentrations could in principle
be restored to preindustrial levels (approx. 750ppb) by removing approximately 3.2 of the
5.3 Gt CHy currently found in the atmosphere [31], though methane could only be maintained
at preindustrial levels by continuous removal that at least balanced anthropogenic methane
emissions, currently 0.36 Gt CH4 yr} (table 1). This amount is orders of magnitude lower than
annual anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, which are currently approximately 40 Gt CO2
[32]. Some disadvantages of removing CH4 compared with CO) are its relative scarcity in the
atmosphere (200 times less abundant) and its lack of a quadrupole moment or weak acidity that,
in the case of CO, can be exploited for concentration and capture.
