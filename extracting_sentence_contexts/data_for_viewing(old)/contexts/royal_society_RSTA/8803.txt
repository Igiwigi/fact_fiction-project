The equation for g is obtained by substituting for q, ? and f* in (7), which becomes

4? (1—a?*) (a?—g’) {a?—g? + (1—a’) #*} —a‘(1-g?) = 0; . . . (18)

this is a quadratic for g*, whose solution may be written

g° =sin® $a (1 - a ; ici =i oe ena (1)
where @ is given by
cot 6 = AK’ cot? a—(tan’$a)/40. . . . . . . « (20)

The ambiguity is settled in practice by the fact that g? must be small if equation (14)
is to be taken as a first approximation to the solution. In practice, as we have said,
bissmall. Valuable information as to the nature of the solution is, therefore, obtainable
by considering its limit as b>0. This gives us a guide as to the actual relative order
of all terms. ;

Let us suppose then that b + 0, that s and q are definite constants, and let us assume
that g is of the same order as a, which by (19) and (20) must be the case unless \ > 0.
Then equation (17) shows that \2a? cos? «/(1—g?) > 0, and, therefore, in the limit,

Equation (21) shows that, if s 4 1, \+0 is impossible. Hence in all cases (s 4 1)
