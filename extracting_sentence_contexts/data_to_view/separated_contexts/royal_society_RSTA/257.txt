(33)

15. This derivation of (32) is not entirely convincing, because terms of order at
(and so comparable with its left-hand side) were disregarded in formulating the five
relations of type (ii). But we can, working backwards, verify that the terms neglected
n (32) are in fact of order a’ at least. In Part III, § 6, the summation &, y(w) related to N points symmetrically grouped
round a central point at a distance a, one point lying on the reference line / = 0. If,
maintaining the symmetrical grouping, we rotate the points so that one lies on the line
0 = f, then a similar argument yields the relation
