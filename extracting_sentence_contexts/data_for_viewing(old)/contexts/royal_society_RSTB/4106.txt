the limits marked out by the degrees of rarity indicated by 3°9 and 4°9 practically all

others, and are commoner, but even here we have not the least idea how much of the

This fact, that there is little difference between the different orders, also comes out
if we take the rarities of the orders as a whole, in those cases where they have
more than 19 species, the average number in a family in Ceylon. This shows
Anonacee 3°8, Capparidacese 3°9, Dipterocarpacee 4°9, Malvaceze 2°9, Tiliaceze 3°6,
Geraniaceze 3°3, Rutaceze 3°3, Ampelidaceze 2°9, Leguminosee 3:4, Myrtacese 3°7,
Melastomacez 4°], Cucurbitaceze 3°1, Rubiaceze 3°6, Compositee 3°0, Ebenaceze 4-1,
Styracew 41, Apocynacew 3°1, Asclepiadaceze 3:9, Convolvulacese 3:5, Scrophu-

Lauracexe 3°6, Loranthaceze 4°0, Euphorbiaceze 3°6, Urticaceze 3:0, Orchidaces 4°1,
Scitaminex 3:7, Commelinaceze 3°6, Palmacewe 3°1, Aracew 3:4, Cyperaces 3°2, and
Graminex 3°2.

Examination of this list shows that the whole range of rarity is only from 2°9 to
