fix), N(«)¢ aS; so a is a unit of S if and only if N(«) is a unit of R. By expressing the fact
that the discriminant of the polynomial (x—a)~-!f(x) belongs to S, we obtain the relation
D(a)e (d(a))? S. Still assuming that « € G, it is a well-known consequence of Theorem 17 that
(1.1) d(a) SER[a]; a fortiort D(x) S < Rl a]. These relations still hold when G is replaced
by its integral closure in L.
