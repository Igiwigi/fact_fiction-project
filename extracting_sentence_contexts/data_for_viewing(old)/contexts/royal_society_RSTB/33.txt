With such a ferment solution to begin with, other means were necessary to detect the
peptone if any were formed. Kravcnâ€™s own control experiments were somewhat scanty.

Proteotytic FERMENTS.

The nature of the ferment discovered by v. Gorup-BrsanEz was not satisfactorily
established in his investigations. He calls attention himself to the fact that in the
young shoots of newly-germinated plants of Vicia, under certain conditions, large
quantities of leucin and asparagin might be shown to exist. The ease with which
crystalline bodies of that nature would be able to pass through such structures as cell
walls points to the probability of this rather than peptone being the form in which
nitrogenous matter would pass to the growing points from the reservoirs in which it
had been stored. Moreover, the fact that peptone cannot be discovered in or near the
growing parts, and the almost complete indiffusibility of any other form of proteid
matter, lend much support to the view that crystalline products are the ultimate
expression of germinative metabolism of proteids. On these grounds, therefore, there
is a great probability that the proteolytic ferment in the seeds will be found to
resemble the tryptic rather than the peptic ferment of the animal organism.
V. Gorur-Brsanez was not, however, able to convince himself that the ferment in
the vetch seed carried the changes in the fibrin beyond the stage of peptone.

Since that time Marri} has shown that a tryptic ferment is present in the latex
of Papaya carica.

When y. Gorup-BrsaNnez was writing, but little had been ascertained as to the
