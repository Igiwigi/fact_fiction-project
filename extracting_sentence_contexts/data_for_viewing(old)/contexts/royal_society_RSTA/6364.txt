horizontal links, respectively, in the case where the strength in the structure is uniform. However,
when the strength of these links differs from the strength of the even links, we obtain new values
fo and wo where failure can occur (see also (5.2)). It is clear then that if By > 1, we can extend the
admissible range of speeds for which the bridge failure regime studied here is possible. Likewise,
a similar effect can be achieved if wp > 1. These values therefore define a rectangle (in general) in
f-@ space within which a semi-infinite bridge crack regime can be found.

Outside this region, non-steady failure regimes can be encountered. Assuming 0 < w < wp,
i.e. horizontal links in the medium remain intact, for B > 6o, based on the analysis of figure 6 in
ยง5d, it can be conjectured that the crack propagates with a more complex bridge fracture regime
which we term the macro-cell bridge crack regime (figure 8). This fracture regime involves a
bridge crack whose structure and periodicity change with increase of the initial stored potential
energy in the system. This results from the fact that the increase in this energy allows more odd-
numbered vertical nodes behind the crack to surpass the threshold for failure. The accumulation
of this process, owing to the increase in stored initial energy, would allow transition to the regime
where a semi-infinite open crack can propagate in the structure at a second critical value of 6 that we
denote by fh; (figure 8).

In a similar way, one can also consider regimes where 0 < f < fy and w > wo. Analogously,
we obtain descriptions of new fracture regimes. Possible candidates include

(i) a finite bridge crack regime for wo < w < @}. Here, the bridge crack is accompanied by the
appearance of failure sites along the horizontal chains. This causes the chain to partition
