The form of this function is shown in fig. 5, and it would look as though a train of such
functions superposed on each other would give a graph not unlike that of the sunspot
numbers (¢f. below, fig. 6). But the difference
[\ equation of this function is of the third order, and
\ would therefore have to be extended to include
\ Uy_3- This raises again the serious theoretical
\ difficulties briefly mentioned in Section II, B,
} \ essen Cs p. 278. Even if the difference equation is in
: ~~~ fact of the form supposed, it is doubtful if it can
be determined. The question does render it
necessary, however, to examine the correlations

of u, with w,_s and more distant terms, and see what information they give us.

B.—The Correlations of u, with u,-, and more Distant Terms, and the Information given
thereby.—On the left of Table TV are given the serial correlations, as 1 have termed them,
for WoLFER’s sunspot numbers and the graduated numbers respectively: 7, is the
correlation between uw, and v,_;, 7, the correlation between wu, and u,_, and so on.
From these all the partial correlations are calculated on the assumption that the series
is indefinitely long, so that we may assume that the correlation between w,_, and w,_,
is the same as that between uw, and w,—,, and so forth—an assumption which implies
