have been allowed for by introducing a factor 10~” similar to that used by ABEaG to
express the decay of specific inductive capacity as the temperature rises.

Although these factors may not represent perfectly the variations of ionie mobility
and of ionisation with temperature, the formula has been found to give a satisfactory
representation of the experimental facts over a wide range of temperature. It
accurately expresses the varied types of conductivity-temperature curves recorded in
the present paper, and indicates not only the point of inflexion which is observed in
moderately dilute solutions of sodium hydroxide between 50° C. and 100° C., but also
the maximum conductivity and the second point of inflexion shown in our general
conductivity-temperature curve.

Even more important is the fact that by means of this formula it is possible, for
the first time as we believe, to analyse the conductivity-temperature curves for
concentrated as well as for dilute solutions, and to estimate separately the effects
produced by the increase of mobility and by the decay of ionisation which accompany
a rise of temperature.

(2.) Influence of Viscosity on Conductivity.—In the conventional method of
deducing the coefficient of ionisation from the molecular conductivity by means of
the equation «= A/A,., it is assumed that the ionic mobility is independent of the
concentration. As, however, there is a marked difference (amounting to something
