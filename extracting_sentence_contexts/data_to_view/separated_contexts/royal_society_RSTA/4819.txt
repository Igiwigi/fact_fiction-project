Considering the large energy
deficit (more than 1 eV), the recombination is obviously unable to produce an emissive state of
rubrene directly in such a device, which led the authors to postulate a rather doubtful Auger-
like two-step injection mechanism to explain the nature of electroluminescence. However, the
observed electroluminescence can be readily understood without invoking any new mechanisms
if one notices that the recombination leading to the triplet state of rubrene is not forbidden by : =

energy, and, furthermore, the rubrene triplets readily undergo TTA to generate the emissive Sy
singlet state. In fact, by using a similar heterojunction in doped OLEDs resembling highly efficient a
OLEDs [29], we have been able to construct red-emitting devices operating relatively efficiently aed
at similarly low voltages and demonstrate that their electroluminescence is dominated by the 22
delayed component that shows all typical tell-tale signs of TTA (T. D. Pawlik, D.
