Thus, the multi-mode slow-
light regime of our glide waveguide design is not suitable for the exploitation of directional effects

n@) = (6.1)

SThis transition is complicated by the presence of an (anti)-crossing between the two guided modes at ka/2 ~ 0.476, before
they come back together for a degeneracy at ka/2 =0.5. It is also made more complicated by the fact that at the bandedge
itself any linear combination of modes is itself a mode. The modes found by the eigensolver were not in fact a time-reversal
pair. However, we found such a pair by taking linear complex combinations of the eignesolver’s solutions.

Figure 4. The effects of coupling to multiple modes on directionality. (a) The band diagram of the glide waveguide. (b) The
maximum value of 7 in the vicinity of the waveguide as a function of frequency. (c) |E|? and 53 for the three modes at the same
frequency in this waveguide (indicated by points in (a)). 53 in the first panel has been inverted to account for the fact the group
velocity of the mode is in the opposite direction to the other two.
