in the theoretical calculations are also shown. Here the first column shows the values of cg at which H’(co) = 0 (comax in the
first row and Comin in the second), and the second column shows the corresponding values of ¢) where an eigenvalue crosses
Zero (or a Floquet multiplier crosses 1), together with H’’ (co) and ox.

but cl, approaches the corresponding co values. This is a consequence of the fact that, for small 1,
the solution at the boundaries is larger than the machine precision. To connect these results with the theoretical analysis of (3.4), figure 5 shows the dependence of
22 with respect to c near dl, for both bifurcations, which according to theorem 5.3, must be linear
in the vicinity of cl, with the slope

where a is defined in (3.11). To compute f; in (6.9), we use cg, i.e. the value of c at which H’(c) = 0;
however, for determining a we calculate the eigenmodes at ch, as this value corresponds to the
point where we are closer to a quadruplet of zero eigenvalues.
