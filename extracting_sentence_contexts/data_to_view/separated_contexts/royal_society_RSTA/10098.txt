This is the form obtained in the solution of the restricted problem of ยง 3. We conclude that if f(a/7), as expressed in (44), with values derived from any
solution of the problem of the equilibrium of two ellipsoids unconnected by a pipe,
is positive, the two figures are too far apart to admit of junction, and vice versd. I
have in fact always found it positive, although always diminishing as 7 diminishes, so
that junction would seem to be always impossible, at least so long as the approxima-
tion retains any validity. This might indicate that there is no figure of equilibrium
shaped like an hour-glass with a thin neck. However, I return to this subject in
discussing numerical solutions, and in the summary of results.
