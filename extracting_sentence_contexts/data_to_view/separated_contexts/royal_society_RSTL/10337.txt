Characters of the Seasons in which Complete Botanical Separations were conducted,

In the section on the © Influence of Season on the Produce of Hay,” Part T., pp. 390
to 405, it has been shown how very great was the difference in the amount of the
mixed produce dependent on the climatal conditions, and also what widely different
seasons might yield large, and again, what widely different seasons might yield small
crops. In fact, a given quantity of the mixed produce grown under the same conditions
as to manuring, might be composed very differently in two different seasons. This
difference was stated, in general terms, to consist not only in the different, proportions
in which the various Orders, genera, or species were represented, but also in the
character of development of the plants in regard to leafiness or stemminess, luxuriance
and succulence, or maturation, &c. Tt is obvious that, if this be 80, it is essential to
consider the characters of the geasons themselves, in which the botanical separations
were made; and to come to some conclusjion as to their probable influence on the
botanical composition, and the character of development, of the mixed herbage, aparb
from that of progressive exhaustion of the soil, or the continued application of different
manuring substances ; 80 as in some degree to discriminate between results due to the
