droop, and the
experiment always ends in the entry of air. By closing the cut surface and allowing
the water to enter through the surface of the wood of a Conifer, a suction of as much
as 70 centims. was shown, and since the branches were 2 metres long and erect, the
total head was greater than the atmospheric pressure. Vinest has shown that dead
branches may ultimately generate as high a suction as living ones, and in fact the
higher suctions are more the result of imbibition forces than of leaf suction. Ordinary transpiring leaves should theoretically be able to transmit an osmotic
suction of several atmospheres to the vessels, whereas as soon as the tension in the
vessels reaches 4â€”} of an atmosphere, the transpiration current is either strongly
retarded or entirely stopped, even when short lengths of stem are used. Long
lengths of stem do not develop a higher but usually a lower suction than short ones.
