In the Myriapoda, he found the anterior portion of this structure in the
Scolopendra divided into three branches, which are distributed to the head, and that
the middle one of these gave off other branches, the course of which he was unable
to trace. In 1828 Carvs published his discovery of a circulation in insects; and
Waexe in 1832, Mr. BowtrBaNK in 1833**, and Mr, TyrreL + in 1835, added
some new facts. But our own countryman Huwre, long before this period, seems to
have been acquainted with the course of the circulatory fluids in insects, and with the
existence of the lateral canals described by Wacxes, which he regarded as veins. Professor MuLLeR{{ also, in 1824 had traced a connexion between the dorsal vessel
of insects and the ovaries, which he described as vascular, although that opinion was
controverted by Carvs, 'Tzeviranus, BurwsisreR and Wacntr.
