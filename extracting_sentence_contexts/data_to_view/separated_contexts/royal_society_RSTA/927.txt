The conditions of flow then were neither strictly identical nor identical
with the conditions of flow in an infinite fluid; e.g., on a line y= 1-5 there were
differences in the value of v determined with each cylinder of 0-005. Now H, is a
harmonic function tending to zero at infinity whereas H becomes very small at the
outer boundary of the fluid. It will be seen then that the rate of decrease outward of
H, is less than that of H, a fact which is clearly apparent in fig. 10, in the inset along
a= -+ 3-0. As the wake was oscillating the region behind « = — 3-0 was neglected in the present
work owing to the difficulty of timing the photography so as to obtain a set of photo-
graphs of the wake at any one phase of oscillation.
