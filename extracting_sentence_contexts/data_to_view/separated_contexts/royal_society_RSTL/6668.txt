A. CAYLEY ON SKEW SURFACES, OTHERWISE SCROLLS.

and the generating line of the other kind counting as 4[q—1] lines through three
points, 80 that

ImP+m—2+M=ip—1P+H[0—17. The complete scroll $(1z) is made up of the hyperboloid considered as generated by the
generating lines of the one kind taken Z{[ p}* times, and the hyperboloid considered as
generated by the generating lines of the other kind taken Z[q]* times (80 that there is
in this case the speciality that the surfaces S'(m?), S"(77?) are in fact the same surface). And hence we have
S(w)=(2(3[pP+3[197)=)8[PP +3007

21. I notice also the case of a system of 1m lines.
