Up to the present we have not been successful, by means of a chemical
solvent, in removing the « from such an alloy as Sn 16 in order to analyse the 6. The character of the pattern of riband, bar and rosette, or fern-leaf, seen in the CD
alloys when cold and unchilled, is partly, we think, dependent on the greater or less
perfection of the transformations that take place during solidification. Too rapid
cooling during solidification will leave the grains somewhat copper-rich with some tin-
rich mother-substance round them; in fact, the D transformation will not be com-
plete. This will lead, when the 6 crystallises, to its doing so in broad ribands,
enclosing areas in which it is more sparingly distributed as rosette or fern-leaf. In
the chill at 558°, and the same is seen in the unchilled alloy of fig. 52, the 6 forms
many straight pointed bars.
