Eighth Stage of Development.

176. In another ovum from the Fallopian tube, the vesicles in the centre of the
oyum (Plate VI. fig. 108.) were found still more numerous and $till smaller ; in other
respects not differing from those in figs. 106 and 107. 'The membranes of the ovum
were in a tate yery closely resembling that of the corresponding parts in fig. 106.

177. The oyum probably passes through stages, which, in both the size and number
of its central vesicles, are intermediate in reference to that I have endeavoured to re-

+ The term © yelk”—as applied to the contents of the ovarian vesicle of Baxz—has not been discontinued
in this memoir; but from the facts recorded in it—and more particularly from the changes delineated in
Plate VI, figs. 1054. 106. 107 and 108.—I am disposed to question the analogy which this term implies (par.
122, and Note. 318.).

{ Later observations strengthen this supposition, and enable me to extend it to vesicles in the succeeding
*tages. The nucleus was very distinct in each of the two vesicles occupying the centre of the oyum in fig. 1054,
a stage obviously between my © Fifth” and © Sixth,” but not met with in time to be described in its proper
place. The pellucid nucleus, however, in all of these vexicles, scems to be present during a certain period only
of their existence (par. 315 to 317.).
