condensed swarms of meteorites, the consequent temperature being high and the
increase in light sudden. In Nova Andromede, where the increase in luminosity was
not so sudden, the temperature was not nearly so high. In this case we had most
probably to deal with the collision of two swarms not nearly so condensed as in Nova
Coron ; perhaps a slightly condensed swarm passing through the Andromeda nebula,
in which case the increase in temperature would be more gradual and comparatively
small. When my paper of November, 1887, was read [ was unaware that comets
would give evidence of absorption in their spectra, but the more recent work has shown
that in comets at or near perihelion the absorption of Mn and Pb have been indicated
very frequently. Hence, no difference exists between the spectra of new stars and of
comets. I remarked in that papert that the spectra of stars of Olass IIIa. and some
“ Nove,” notably Nova Orionis, were strikingly similar, and I wrote regarding this
fact : ‘‘ We have then, in these bodies, a spectrum integrating the radiation of carbon
and the absorption of Mn and Pb vapour, and I have shown that comets give at some
time during their revolution, providing the perihelion distance is not too great, the
same spectrum ”

Nova Cygni decreased in magnitude in a very similar manner to TycHo Braue’s
Nova, dimming very suddenly at first, and more slowly later on. In three months
the Nova fell from the 3rd to the 8th magnitude, and then the fall from 8 to 11 took
twelve months. The brightness of this Nova, as well as its long period of visibility,
afforded the opportunity for many observations of its spectrum, the result being that
the sequence of phenomena, as far as it goes, is much more complete in it than in any
other Nova, which brings us to the conclusion that other Nove would have given a more
complete sequence if more spectroscopic observations could have been made.
