ELECTROMOTIVE PROPERTIES OF MALAPTERURUS ELECTRICUS. 397

electromagnetic signal showed no appreciable movement when connected with the
Malapterurus.

Although the Torpedo central discharge thus appears to recur at a very rapid rate,
the susceptibility of this central periodicity to fatigue, though present, appears to be
less marked than in the case of the Malapterwrus. On the other hand, the intensity
of the individual organ response in the last-named fish is but little affected by a
central fatigue which has so sensibly influenced the central periodicity. The efferent
cell discharge, when it does occur, may still be very pronounced. In connection
with this there is the suggestive fact of the striking difference in the structure
of the central nervous mechanism. The Zorpedo, with its large electrical lobes, con-
taining thousands of nerve cells, giving rise to 80,000 efferent electrical nerve fibres,
forms an extraordinary contrast to the Malapterwrus with its two nerve cells and
two nerve fibres.

Finally, the results referred to in this section, throw some light on the efficiency
for its purpose of the organ activity. It is well known that a series of electrical
currents occurring in rapid succession, and all similarly directed (monophasic) is of
great potency in stimulating physiological tissues, and the possession of an organ
capable of producing these furnishes a powerful armament either for attack or defence.
In the Torpedo and the G'ymnotus this essential feature of the weapon, the production
of currents of similar sign in rapid succession, appears to be mainly achieved by a
