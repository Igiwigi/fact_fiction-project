(1995/97). That represents a decline of 40 million compared to 1990/92. At the World Food Summit in 1996, world
leaders pledged to reduce the number of hungry people to around 400 million by 2015. At the current rate of
progress, a reduction of 8 million undernourished people a year, there is no hope of meeting that goal?

Cereals constitute about one-half of the world’s food. The North American wheat crop has provided most
of the world’s requirements since 1950 and has struggled to keep pace with demand. Even though wheat
yields per unit area have doubled during the last 20 years, wheat consumption has matched production.

Wheat reserves have been known to fall as low as 10% of consumption in recent years; a margin for error
which one relatively modest drought could readily tip into deficit and famine. Yield improvements achieved

y conventional plant breeding, mechanization, herbicides, pesticides and nitrogenous fertilizers are remark-
able, but a further doubling of output in the next 20 years seems most unlikely. The fact that it might be
achieved without modern agricultural practice is patently absurd. It is the lack of realism in the arguments
put forward by pressure groups that create real dangers for society and wherein lie the worst consequences
of the lack of public understanding of

Given the opportunity, most would buy carrots that have never been near lindane. Realistically, the possi-

ility is remote that ‘organic’ farming could do more than still such anxieties and concerns of a handful of
relatively wealthy people in countries such as Britain. Recent events suggest we have a propensity to take
‘organic’ farming to absurd lengths. Was an informed scientific community asked if it was a good idea to
feed dead sheep to live cows? Had the question been put, the answer must surely have been ‘no’. As we all

now, beef grows best on rubisco, but in photosynthesis research, as in biology generally, repercussions of the
