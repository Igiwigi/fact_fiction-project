stomata been closed there must have resulted a great increase in the assimilation. This was not the case; in fact there was a decrease owing to the duration of the
experiment. The rise in the respiration resulting from the wounding of the leaf could
introduce no error, since at so low a temperature the respiration even if doubled or
trebled would still be negligible. As a contrast to the above an experiment may be given in which cutting produced
an increase in the assimilation.
