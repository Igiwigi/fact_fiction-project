W. BARNES ON THE THEORY OF THE

In an analogous treatment of the double gamma function we may expect that
similar limit theorems will be required. This, in fact, is the case; but for our
present purpose it is sufficient to take particular cases of the asymptotic expansion
for log T(z). To make use of this approximation we need only remember that (“Theory of the
Gamma Function,” § 39) if z and @ be any finite complex quantities, and 7 a positive
integer,

log Tl (2 + mo) = log [2 + (x + 1)o|@] — log T, (|).

m=0

We suppose that such values of the logarithms are chosen that additive terms
involving 27. do not enter. In other words, we shall say that the logarithms have
their absolute values, the formula just written being merely a convenient way of
writing the identity

1 aE + @+ Da)

On differentiating this identity with respect to z we have
” it
2 = le + (n+ Iolo] — yy, M2|0)

w=0(2 + mo)
