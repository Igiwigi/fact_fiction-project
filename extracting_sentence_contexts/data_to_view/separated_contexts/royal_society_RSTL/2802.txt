Part I—On the Changes in the Envelopes. HAvING previously described the structure of the ovum of mammiferous animals,
as it exists in the ovary before impregnation®*, I now proceed to relate some facts re-
specting the changes which it undergoes in consequence of that act. My observations in reference to this point are the following. Observation 1,—On Wednesday the 16th, and Thursday the 17th September, 1835,
I examined the internal organs of generation of a Rabbit, which had been impreg-
nated on the afternoon of the Saturday preceding, and which was killed on the after-
noon of Tuesday.
