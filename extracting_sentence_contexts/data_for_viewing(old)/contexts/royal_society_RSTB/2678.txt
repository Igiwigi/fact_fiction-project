between the observations of Kroun and of Mitrer was filled up by ALEXANDER
Agassiz (1), who, on the one hand, succeeded in carrying on the rearing of arti-
ficially fertilised eggs of the American Sea-urchin, Strongylocentrotus droébachiensis,
to the development of a typical echinopluteus larva, and, on the other hand,
obtained, by the use of the tow-net, a complete series of the later stages, so that in
this way for the first time a complete history of the changes in external form under-
gone by a single species was obtained. ‘

Under the name of Water-tube, AGassiz described the ccelom of the larva,
and he observed its origin from the gut. Alreatly before this time in this and other
classes of Echinodermata the formation of the ccelom had been described by
Merscunikorr (17), who called it the vaso-peritoneal vesicle, and who fully recog-
nised its origin from the gut and the fact that it gave rise to the water-vascular
system of the adult, a point which AGassiz could not observe.

In 1882 two pupils of Professor Brookes, of Baltimore, Messrs. Conroy and
GarMAN, published an account of the external features of the development and
metamorphosis of Arbacia, in a paper which was inaccessible to me. It is, however,
summarised by Professor Brookes in his ‘ Handbook of Invertebrate Zoology’ (3),
with the addition of observations of his own, and the summary contains a detailed
account of the external features of the metamorphosis.

In 1889 Bury (4), who had already published an exhaustive account of the
development of Antedon rosacea, described a series of stages in the development of
Echinoidea, based on plankton material. In this paper for the first time the division
