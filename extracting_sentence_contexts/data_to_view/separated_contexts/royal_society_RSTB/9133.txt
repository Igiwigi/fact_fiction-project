At present, it is
unclear whether the reduction in activity is caused by a direct
behavioural response to light, or whether there is a density
effect, with a reduced abundance underneath the lampposts.

(e) Summary

In summary, we do observe direct effects on a number of
species, and see emerging long-term effects. These vary
with different species—the response of wood mice may be

trelle bats are most likely mediated by the response of
