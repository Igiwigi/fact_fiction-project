2. Insitu measurements

Dust with sizes smaller than approximately micrometres is typically observed with in situ
measurements; for instance, the Ulysses dust instrument that explored the Solar System dust
cloud during two solar cycles covered the sizes from a few tens of nanometres to a few
micrometres [2,10]. Dust particles are also observed with electric field measurements because the
impact process generates transient plasma cloudlets that influence, for example, the measured
spacecraft potential. The STEREO plasma wave instrument discovered nanodust with sizes of
presumably a few nanometres near 1 AU and this detection was possible because the impact
speeds are high and therefore the nanodust impacts generate comparatively large signals [8].
A number of detailed studies were carried out related to the STEREO observations of nanometre-
sized and larger dust near 1 AU [11-17]. The detection process was described and studied in detail
[18], but there are still some open questions. In fact, it is intriguing that, in spite of large time
variations in the observed fluxes, the average fluxes fit well to an extrapolation of the empirical
interplanetary dust flux model [19] to smaller sizes (figure 1). For Cassini, although an analysis
of the plasma wave data during the Cassini cruise towards Jupiter was made only during parts
of the orbit to avoid possibly incurring instrumental effects, it still provided data on nanodust
fluxes at different distances from the Sun. The observed fluxes were found to be consistent with
the assumption that the majority of the nanodust originates from the vicinity of the Sun and then
is accelerated in the solar wind [20].
