The Coal Measure Elasmobranchs are Symmorium reniforme and Petrodus patelliformis.
Of these the first may readily be interpreted as a Cladodont with an elongated but not
subdivided metapterygium. Petrodus is more interesting because it is typically tribasal,
there being no extended metapterygial axis, and the straight parallel radials are short
and jointed, a definite advance on the Lower Carboniferous Sphenacanthus and Tristychius.

It follows from this analysis that the most primitive known Elasmobranch pectoral
fin, from which all others can be derived, is that of Cladoselache, and that the most
striking of its characters are the parallelism, extension nearly to the fin margin, and
unjointed nature of the radials, and the parallel series of short basals.

I have shown that the best known Acanthodian pectoral fin (that of Acanthodes) is
tribasal and has extremely short jointed radials. In fact it resembles a type of fin, found
only in Mesozoic or still later Elasmobranchs, which is the result of a long evolutionary
process. The pectoral fin of the Lower Devonian Ischnacanthus clearly agrees in its
general structure with that of Acanthodes. So that even the earlier Acanthodians cannot
be compared with the very much more recent primitive Elasmobranchs.

The oldest known Elasmobranch neural cranium is Cladodus wildungensis, the only
other reasonably well-known Palaeozoic form being Diacranodus (Pleuracanthus) texensis.
These two agree very closely indeed with modern Elasmobranchs like Notidanus or

Chlamydoselache. The Elasmobranch neural cranium from the earliest times onward has
thus the following qualities: It is composed of cartilage with a characteristic superficial
calcification of a single layer of prismatic granules. (No fragment of any Palaeozoic
