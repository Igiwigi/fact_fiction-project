> By means of these proportions it is possible to approximate to the amounts of the
Sending-moments and shearing-forces in other ships of the type when their displace-
Anents and lengths are known ; only it is necessary to remember that in many cases the
Sesults obtained must be regarded as strictly limiting values, on account of the fact that
n the * Minotaur the excesses of weight at the extremities for still water and the fine-
—ess of form are both extremely great. YZ Passing on to the second typical ship, the * Victoria and Albert,” we will suppose her
be balanced on the crest of a wave of her own length (300 feet) and 20 feet high
from hollow to crest.
