The portions of nerves examined show very clearly, not only that in regeneration
the young fibres are produced both in the central and in the peripheral segment, but
also that reunion of the ends is not an essential to the production of young fibres in
the peripheral segment (Plate 7, figs. 2 and 4; Plate 8, fig. 2). This independent
origin of new fibres in the peripheral segment, without previous reunion with the
central end, first observed and described by Paturpzaux and VuLpran (38, 39), has
been opposed by almost all who have since made a study of regeneration of nerves ;
and their opinion was also greatly weakened by the fact that VuLPrAN (77, 86) him-
self withdrew from his former position. MircHent (80), and recently Bowxpy (146)
have found in the examination of portions removed from the peripheral segments of
un-united divided nerves, that many newly formed nerve fibres are there present. The opponents of this view give various explanations of the results of these observers.
