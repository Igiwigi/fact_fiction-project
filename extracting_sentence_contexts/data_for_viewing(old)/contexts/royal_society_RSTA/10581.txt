STRESSES AND VIBRATIONS IN THE EARTH.

$ 31. It has already been seen that in dealing with a gravitating sphere of the size
of the earth it is necessary to take into account terms which are omitted by Lord
KeEtvin and others—the terms which introduce into our equations the gravitational
tendency to instability.

It is of some importance to know whether the existing solution for the vibrations
and displacements of the earth would be altered to an appreciable extent by the
inclusion of these terms. The general frequency-equation which is given on p. 167 is
too complicated for manipulation, and is, moreover, open to the objection that it does
not represent the facts of the case; for, inside the earth, the strains caused by
permanent gravitation cannot legitimately be treated as small. +

§ 32. Considerations of a general nature will, however, give us some insight into
the question. In an imaginary earth, in which \, » are infinitely great, the
gravitational terms will be of no importance in comparison with those representing
the elastic stresses. The true solution will, therefore, become identical with the
classical solution in which the gravitational terms are neglected. For smaller values
of d, » the error will become appreciable, and if d, ~ continue to decrease this error
will become infinite as soon as the first point of bifurcation is reached ; for at a point
of bifurcation the application of an infinitesimally small external force will produce a
finite displacement in the solid. For intermediate values of A, » the error will be
small if A, ~ are great compared with the critical values of A, » at the point of
