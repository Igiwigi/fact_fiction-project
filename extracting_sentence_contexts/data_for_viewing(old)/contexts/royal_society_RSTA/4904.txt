fumaric/L-malic acid. This natural subsystem is isomorphic to another three-state set consisting
of oxaloacetic acid, citric/isocitric acid and pyruvic acid with oxaloacetic acid, which is
cyclically permuted by the word 58! = a3a2Paja4a5030102030496Pa1a5a2030496. The isomorphism
is determined by words w7 = 4743414406020506030\02030405Pa, mapping the first three-state
set onto the second one, and w7=430,a7a304a5Pa, taking the second set back onto the
first. Applying a3a,a4a5a6 takes the second three-state set to its two-state subset oxaloacetic
acid and pyruvic acid with oxaloacetic acid on which the word ¢€ = Paza3a,a4a546 acts as a
transposition: xg - Paza3a1a40506 = X1Xg - 420301040506 = X1Xg - 41440506 = X2Xg - 40506 = X2Xg, and
also x2 xg - Pagazayaqa5ag = X3 - 0301040506 = X4 - 1040506 = X5 + 40506 = Xo - A506 =X7 - 46 =X. By
definition then, the representative order 3 cyclic permutation group on x2 Xg, X2 X5, X2 X7 weakly
controls the order 2 cyclic group on x2 xg and xg. In this case, the first three-state subset acetyl CoA
together with exactly one of citric/isocitric acid, oxaloacetic acid or fumaric/L-malic acid does in
fact weakly control each of its two-element subsets, e.g. via the action of ag this three-state subset
maps onto the pair x2 xg of acetyl CoA and oxaloacetic acid together and x3 x5 of acetyl CoA and
succinyl CoA. While no element of the three-element group transposes the latter pair {x2xg, 2x5},

It follows by the holonomy theorem (e.g. [9, ch. 3]) or theorem 6.1 below that the automaton can be decomposed by a
cascade alternating one copy of each cyclic permutation group C,, (6 > n > 2) with series-parallel banks of flip-flops (which
have no non-trivial subgroups).
