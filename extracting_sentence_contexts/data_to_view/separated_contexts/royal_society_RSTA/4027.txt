We ascribe this behaviour to a shift in the pI of BsLA when bound to the airâ€”water interface. Indeed, the pI of HFBII was found to shift when adsorbed to an air bubble [31]. This pI change for
adsorbed HFBII is thought to arise from the fact that a large proportion of the protein is no longer
in contact with water, therefore only a fraction of the functional groups are ionizable. A shift in pI
was also observed for emulsion films stabilized by B-lactoglobulin [32,33]. In this case, the shift
was attributed to conformational changes that occur upon surface adsorption.
