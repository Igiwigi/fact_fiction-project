According to this hypothesis, cold can with no more propriety
be considered as the absence of heat, than a low or grave sound
can be considered as the absence of a higher or more acute
note; and the admission of rays which generate cold, involves |
no absurdity, and creates no confusion of ideas,

On a superficial view of the subject, it may perhaps appear
difficult to reconcile solidity, hardness, and elasticity, with those
never-ceasing motions which we have supposed to exist among
the constituent particles of all bodies; but a patient investiga=-
tion of the matter will show, that the admission of that supposed
fact, instead of rendering it more difficult to form distinct and
satisfactory ideas of the causes on which those qualities of bodies
depend, will rather facilitate those abstruse researches.

Judging from all the operations of nature, of the causes of

which we are able to form any distinct ideas, we are certainly |
led to conclude, that the force of dead matter, (and perhaps of
living matter also,) or its power of affecting, that is to say, of |
moving, other matter, or of resisling its impulse, depends on its
motion.
If, therefore, solid (or fluid) bodies have any powers whatever,
either of impulse or of resistance, it appears to me to be more
