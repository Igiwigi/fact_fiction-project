Without such a clue the problem never can be consistently
Solved. It is hoped that such a clue or principle is afforded in the succeeding account. It rests upon the fact that between the reproductive masses and the ciliated segmental
tubes there exists a necessary and regular connexion, and that the glandular masses of
the adjacent segments are distinct from and independent of one another. A knowledge
of this leading principle of arrangement enables the anatomist at once to convert, a con-

fused heap of glands into an orderly system of parts, and moreover, to bring the sexual
apparatus of this Annelid within the pale of definite homologies. Every ring in the body of this worm (except a few at the head and tail) contains two
segment organs, one on either side of the intestine : they are convoluted, tubular organs,
arising from the ventral aspect of the general cavity near the median line, curving
upwards round the intestine and terminating in a fan-shaped ciliated extremity, which
is bridled to the septum near its dorsalmost edge.
