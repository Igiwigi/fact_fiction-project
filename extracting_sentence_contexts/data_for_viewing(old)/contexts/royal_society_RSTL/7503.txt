in the great caudal venous trunk and its tributary vein, the blood-stream does not yield
80 readily, as above described, to displacement by the lymph-stream from the heart, but
the propulsion of the drops of red blood presents a remittent rather than an intermittent
character.

Influence of the force with which the lymph-stream is propelled from the caudal heart in
accelerating and promoting the flow of blood in the eaudal vein.

The force with which the lymph is propelled by the heart into the caudal yein may
be judged of comparatively by contrasting the force of the stream, as indicated by
rapidity of flow, in the tributaries of the vein, with that of the stream in the vein itself
whilst the lymph is being propelled into it. Within the vein, the force of the lymph-
stream is evidenced by the fact above mentioned, that at the moment of the propulsion
of the lymph into the vein by the contraction of the heart, the onward course of the
blood in the tributary vein is arrested and the column of blood in the caudal trunk
displaced to one side; and also by the manner in which the drops of red blood or agglo-
merations of red corpuscles, which enter the caudal trunk from the tributary yein during
the diastole, are scen driven on in the lymph-stream at each systole of the heart.

Through the medium of the stream of lymph propelled into the great caudal yein at
each stroke of the heart, an impetus is communicated to the column of blood in that
vessel, which we can observe has the effect of accelerating and promoting its onward flow
to the blood-heart of the animal.

We thus see that though the caudal heart of the eel is a lymphatic heart, its function
