Yet at the five and a half day stage considerable distortion of these intersomitic veins
which run into the anterior cardinal has occurred. This must mean that the region
of the anterior cardinal which is elongating originally lay in front of the level of the
cervical ganglia. Applying such criteria to the arterial system, the fact that at the
five and a half day stage those intersomitic arteries behind the twelfth interspace
are as yet undisturbed must mean that the particular section of dorsal aorta between
this level and the aortic arches must be contracting in length, leaving that caudal
to this level still in its original condition. At the seven and a half day stage
reconstructed in fig. 16, Plate 9, the most anterior intersomitic artery as yet
undisturbed is that of the eighteenth intersomitic space. Concomitant with this shortening of the dorsal aorta behind the aortic arches,
there must take place a lengthening in front.
