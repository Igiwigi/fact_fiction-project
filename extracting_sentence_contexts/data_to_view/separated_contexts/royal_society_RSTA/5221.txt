My experiments
fhave, however, conclusively shown that an inert gas retards the wave by an amount
Awhich depends upon its volume and density. It would seem to follow that each
“layer is heated as a whole and that the advance of the wave depends upon the
Saverage motion of the molecules. Two other facts appear to support this view. It
Bis well known that small electric sparks may be sent through explosive mixtures of
gases, ¢.g., through electrolytic gas, without causing explosion. Yet the temperature
gin the spark must be extremely high, and combination occurs in the path of the spark.
