natural, then, to approach the problem from the standpoint of the equation relating
U, tO U,_1, Uz», ete. Starting also, as I did, with the conception of periodogram analysis
and harmonic periodicities in my mind, it was natural to assume an equation of the
form (6), and an equation of corresponding form for two periodicities. This gave the
first method tried. :

It only occurred to me later that the method started from an unnecessarily limited
assumption; that it would be better simply to find the linear regression equation of
U, ON U,_; U,—», and more terms if necessary, and solve this as a finite difference equation.
This gave my second method. As the results of the first method were interesting, I give
both methods below.

On doing the work I was puzzled by the fact that the equation first found suggested a
period obviously too short. A little consideration suggested that this was probably
due to the presence of superposed fluctuations: as already noted, the graph of sunspot
numbers suggests the presence of minor irregularities due to this cause, notwithstanding

that a certain amount of smoothing has already been introduced by employing the
annual average and not the monthly numbers. I therefore desired to repeat the work
on graduated figures, assuming that graduation would largely eliminate such irregularities,
