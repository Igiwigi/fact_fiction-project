OF THE FIBRES OF THE POSTERIOR ROOTS OF SPINAL NERVES. 89

has described that in Monkeys the ulnar gives a considerable branch to the median in
the upper part of the forearm. It is through this that the above-described distri-
bution takes place. Although present in the Macaque, I have never met with this
forearm branch in Cercocebus nor in Cynocephalus. These latter forms do possess,
however, the somewhat similar communication between external saphenous nerve and
external plantar at the heel deep to the tendo Achillis, which I described and
figured in my former paper in Macacus.* The contribution from ulnar to median
contains cutaneous sensory fibres as well as motor efferent (see p. 107, fig. 11, p. 106,
below). The communication between ulnar and median is normal in most Mammals.t
In Man it occurs in 20 to 25 per cent. of individuals,t a fact which lends more
interest to the physiological analysis of the communication as it exists in Macacus.

It will be noted that although the IInd thoracic nerve contributes to the innervation
of the muscles of the hand and lower forearm, it does not contribute to the sensory
innervation of any part of the skin of the hand, nor even to that of the lower part
of the forearm. Also, although it supplies the muscles of the second intercostal
space, the skin overlying the second intercostal space is not innervated by it. 1 have
already pointed this out as a striking illustration of the want of real basis for the
so-called “ law” (VAN DER Kotx, Hitron), which states that muscles and their over-
lying integument are supplied by the same segmental nerves. The skin over the first
and second intercostal spaces is in great part innervated from segments five and six,
segments further headward than the source of innervation of the underlying muscles,
