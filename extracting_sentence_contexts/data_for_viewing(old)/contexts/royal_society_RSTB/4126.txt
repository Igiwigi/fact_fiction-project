stages indicated by VC or C are species which are really better adapted to the local
conditions than the average of all or of the endemic species, but we do not know that
they are not simply the oldest endemic species, which were very early developed from
species of wide distribution which arrived very early. There are 19 of these species,
belonging to the families Geraniaceze (Balsaminaceze), Myrtaceze, Rubiacese, Composite,
Oleacese, Apocynaceze, Gentianacese, Convolvulaceze, Labiatee, Palmaceze, Pandanacez,
Aracex, and Gramineve, all of which are widely distributed orders, and often orders
which we have other reasons to suppose are old. The rarity of these orders taken
together is 3째36, against 3째5, so that on the whole they are probably old.* The rarity
of the Ceylon and Indian species of those genera which contain the endemies is 3:2, or
less than the rarity of these species as a whole (3째5), and the rarity of the widely
dispersed .species (20 in number) contained in these genera is 2째3, or less than the
rarity of the widely dispersed species as a whole, which is 3, All these facts go
together to show that perhaps the commonness of these 19 endemic forms is really only
a question of age. As we have already said, it perhaps becomes harder for every new
species that comes along to reach the Very Common stage, as the ground will be more
closely taken up by a greater variety of species.

The wonderful regularity and uniformity with which these figures come out goes
to show the great accuracy of the estimates made by TrimEn in his Flora, and at the
same time shows that there must be an important general law underlying them,
which, as I have endeavoured to show, must be that on the average the commonness
of species depends on their age, and is independent of their local adaptation. The latter
will in each individual case have a determining efiect in the degree of commonness
ultimately reached, but we have no ground whatever for making statements to the
