+A i,=0

a system of 7 linear partial differential equations, the common integrals of which will be
the integrals of the system (I.). Woe say © the common. integrals of which,” because in
fact these equations express the conditions to all of which P must be subject in order
that P=0o may be an integral of the system (T.). The formal connexion between the systems (T.) and (TI.) deserves to be carefully
noticed. The several partial differential equations of the system (TIT.) may be formed by
inspection from the columns in the right-hand member of the system (T.) by the follow-
ing rule.
