Though small, they are for the most part moun-
tainous, and present usually a ridge or backbone of high land forming the main
axis of each island, with sharp spurs on each side running down to the sea, Cul-
tivation is practically confined to the lower grounds, where alone there are good
roads, and the interior is covered with dense tropical forest, the aspect of which
varies greatly with the altitude, and through which there are only rough bush paths. The valleys are usually very deep and narrow, and the steep slopes are covered
with plantations of arrowroot, limes, cocoa, coffee, banana or plantain, while most of
the level alluvial ground in the valley bottoms is given up to the growth of sugar cane. In all the British islands, at any rate, the principal peaks and ridges have been
ascended, and the main features of the country are delineated on the Admiralty
charts, which are the best, and in fact the only available maps. As regards the

coast-lines and the lower grounds generally, they are very accurate; but in the
interior only the more important points, the principal mountain summits and the
like, have had their position sufficiently determined. The rest of the country has
apparently been sketched in more or less carefully—but many of the details as, for
example, the courses of the smaller streams, and the number of their branches, cannot
be reliedon.
