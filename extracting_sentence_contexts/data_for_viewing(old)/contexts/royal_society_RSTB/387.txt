relative position, But such results are quite inconsistent with the theory that the
larval ocelli are influenced by the colour, for it is seen that the gold produces effects
when it is shut off from the anterior part of the body together with the head. The

alternative hypothesis—that something in the skin is sensitive to colour influences—
seems at first sight to be opposed by the stronger effects which followed the appli-
cation of the stimulus to the smaller, anterior, skin area. But, in the first place, the
difference between the sizes of the two areas was very small, for the anterior part is
much swollen before pupation; and, furthermore, I now feel sure that I over-compen-
sated for the greater illumination of the upper chamber. I did not allow for the fact
that the larva always spins a film of silk over the glass for a considerable distance
round the boss from which it is suspended, and that the transparency is much
impaired in this way. Finally, it has been shown that when in the last experiment
(XIIL, B., y) there was an equally large opening to the upper as to the lower chamber
the gilt surface when above did actually produce greater results than when it was
below, although the conclusion is only supported by a pair of pupz (the sole survivors
in this experiment). Although there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out of
83 pupw was thus produced is certainly important testimony. Finally, when we
compare these results with those of the more perfect conflicting colour experiments
conducted with the frames previously described (XII., D.), and which will be further
mentioned below, we see that the above explanation of the effects produced in the
compartmented tubes is probably correct ; that such results show that the sensitive
