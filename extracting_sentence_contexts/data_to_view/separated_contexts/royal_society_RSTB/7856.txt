The term is perhaps best confined to a geographical
connotation, as it is used by Pitman (1925). In the second place, it is difficult to determine
the sex of an elephant by casual observation, except when the tusks are really large. It
quite frequently happened, in the course of the present work, that a Game Guard reported
shooting a bull when in fact the animal proved to be a cow. The converse error never
occurred. That this error is fairly general is indicated by the reports of the numbers of
cows and bulls shot during control work each year in Uganda, as given in the Game
Wardenâ€™s Reports from 1925 onwards.
