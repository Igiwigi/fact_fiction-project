In Nephthys Hombergii, though not conspicuous, the chylaqueous fluid is con-
siderable in volume. Its motions are limited in consequence of the frequent bridles
by which the intestines are tied to the integment. Its corpuscles (fig. 30) are rela-
tively scanty. They are spherical in form, and filled with secondary molecules. The
oleous globules which accompany them are numerous. The inferior importance of
the chylaqueous system in these worms is compensated by the highly evolved con-
dition of that of the blood-proper. The branchial processes, which are hollow, are
filled with a coil of vessels, and with a stream of chylaqueous fluid; both fluids
therefore in equal proportions are submitted to aGration.

Of the corpuscles of the peritoneal fluid in the genus Glycera (fig. 31) there is this
extraordinary fact to be related, that they are blood-red in colour, and not unlike in
figure and size those of the blood of Reptiles. In this beautiful worm the true-blood
conforms with the Annelidan law of perfect fluidity ; it bears no visible elements, and
is light red in colour, the colouring element, as in all other Annelids, being dissolved
in the fluid mass. It is remarkable that the fluid contents of the visceral cavity in
Glycera $hould be colourless, while the corpuscles which it holds in Suspension
sbould be filled with a blood-red liquid, contrasting these bodies in a striking
manner with the fluid in which they float. The cavity of the peritoneum is dispro-
portionately capacious. It is little interrupted by segmental septa. The worm is
extremely quick and active in its movements. The true branchic are hollow cylin-
drical appendages, lined within and without by vibratile epithelium, and penetrated
only by the fluid of the peritoneal cavity. They are supplied by no true- blood-vessels.
The chylaqueous fluid therefore is the subject of the respiratory change, for which
