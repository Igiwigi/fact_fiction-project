As in the case of copper and silver, so also in that of bismuth, increase of tem-
perature produces a more rapid rise of E.M.F.; and, in fact, at 2 temperature of 66°

it was almost too sudden for correct observation; the final value, however, is

“affected. It will be seen that at the higher temperatures the E.M.F. rises to
maximum and then fulls slightly to the value at which it remained constant for
several minutes.
