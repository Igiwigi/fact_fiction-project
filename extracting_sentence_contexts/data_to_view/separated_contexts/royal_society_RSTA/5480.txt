Overall, the results
agree well with the DNS [24,25].

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a lattice Boltzmann framework to simulate reactive mixtures. The
novelty of the model lies in the fact that temperature and energy changes due to chemical reaction
are handled naturally without the need of additional ad-hoc modelling of the heat of reaction. This was possible because of the thermodynamic consistency of the underlying multi-component
model [11], which was extended to compressible reactive mixtures. The species interaction is
modelled through the Stefanâ€”Maxwell diffusion mechanism which has been extended in this
work to accommodate the creation and destruction rates of the species due to chemical reaction.
