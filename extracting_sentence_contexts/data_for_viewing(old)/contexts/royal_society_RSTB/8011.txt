‘normal’ lactation anoestrus is longer than the calculated average interval. Another
factor is the possible incidence of pre-natal mortality. After the loss of the embryo, the
cow will presumably become pregnant again relatively soon, so that the time between the
termination of the one pregnancy and the beginning of the next will, again, be shorter
than the normal lactation anoestrus. But at the same time the duration of such a preg-
nancy will be less than the normal gestation period, and a calculation based on an assumed
average pregnancy of 22 months will give an estimate of the average non-pregnant interval,
and hence of the average calving interval, longer than the true one. No evidence of

pre-natal mortality was in fact encountered, but it does appear that 22 months is a maximal
estimate of the average gestation period, and hence that the calculated average calving
interval of nearly 4 years is similarly maximal.

(2) Senescence

In no case could it be shown conclusively that a female had ceased to breed. In one
animal, E4, only the last remnants of the last molar tooth, //,, remained in the lower jaw,
worn down below the level at which the enamel loops give the characteristic pattern. ‘The
teeth of the upper jaw were not quite so advanced in wear. The stomach contents were
decidedly less well masticated than in other animals living in the same conditions and
eating similar food. This animal was clearly lactating, and milk could be easily squeezed
from the nipples. Only one non-pregnant adult female was found which could definitely
