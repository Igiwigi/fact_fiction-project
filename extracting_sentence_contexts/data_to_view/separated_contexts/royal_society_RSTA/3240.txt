Shown by the arrow, the point of kinetic phase transition is consistent with the 1S
transition to complete disorder trapping and growth ofa disordered crystal. The dotted line in region (4) shows the extrapolation :3
of the growth velocity beyond the point of total solute trapping. In fact, at and behind the point of the kinetic transition, the : S
iS

rate of velocity change increases (solid line with squares in region (4)) due to the lack of energy dissipation at the formation of
the superlattice. In this work, we adopt another definition of the interface position, namely a= sre y(z') dzâ€™. This
definition is exact for the case of a symmetric interface profile and allows us to find an exact
interface velocity in the case of an asymmetric steady-state profile.
