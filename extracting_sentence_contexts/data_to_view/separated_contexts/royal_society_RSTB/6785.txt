It would appear, then, that the male spotted hyaena, at
least in the district of Tanganyika Territory where the present series was collected, is
capable of breeding at any time. Breeding would thus be limited only by the occurrence
of oestrus in the female: as is shown below, oestrus in that sex is not a seasonal pheno-
menon, but may occur at any time. The male is thus not only capable of breeding at all
times, but in fact actually does so. THE SPOTTED HYAENA, CROCUTA CROCUTA (ERXLEBEN) 39

correlation between suture-closure and tooth-wear in this sex.
