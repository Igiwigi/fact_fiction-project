Figure 4. Spatial distribution of WeFi measurements in the Boston area, November 2014. These clients had a mapping
application active and were using a cellular carrier to access the Internet.

Further filtering shows that the phones produce interesting data 24h a day, 7 days a week,
and looking for diurnal variation (how the average performance of things varies with the hour
of the day or week) provides a useful way of seeing what clues this flood of data can provide
about the Internet’s overall quality of service and the resulting quality of user experience. For
example, in figure 5, we show the variation over the course of a week (averaged over four
weeks, in fact) of the download performance achieved by two mapping applications, Google
Maps and WAZE’s traffic and navigation application (which was in fact acquired by Google
before these data were taken). We notice that the daily pattern is different between these two
similar applications. One possible reason for the different patterns was discovered when I ran
Traceroutes to the two applications from my own smart phone, while sitting at the Los Angeles
airport (LAX), and found that the servers for the two applications are located in two different
cities. Map updates must reach the phones by different routes, and thus may experience different
network performance.

This sort of Internet ‘health monitoring’, taking advantage of the highly dispersed population
of cellphones, can provide an early warning of congestion problems that occur at the interfaces
between the ASes of the steadily evolving Internet. Can the smart phone monitors also help in
tracing changes in this topology? With more advanced measurement tools, more like the probes
