fallen (from 37) to that of the air, It was found now to be even greater than in
Experiment 1. It thus became clear that the relatively great value of the latter was
not due to a time effect lasting over three months (as was at first thought possible),
but to the fact that the material had been allowed to cool uninterruptedly from a
temperature of about 550° C. (see Experiment 7). If the permeability had been
measured immediately after this cooling it would apparently have been found to be as
high as it was three months later.

An attempt was now made to find how the permeability of the ring in its new state
altered with rising temperature. The result is shown in Experiments 40 to 44. These
explained the apparently anomalous position of the points 3 and 4, which had been
noticed at the time the latter were observed. The permeability varied slightly with
rising temperature, falling at first and then rising. Between 300° and 400° C. it
appeared to reach a maximum value, and then, beyond 400° G., it fell comparatively
rapidly toa well-defined minimum value at about 435° C., beyond which the permeability
quickly rose. It is obvious, therefore, from the data and the figure, that the points
