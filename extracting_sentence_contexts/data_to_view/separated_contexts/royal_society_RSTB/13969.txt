Since there is no reason to expect

s Consider that a group that is currently of size N has the

tion, and this means that p(N) is a declining function of N. The fact that kidnapped individuals can act as helpers
(after an initial period during which they need to be fed) is
implicit in the p(N) decreasing with N. Note that it is biologi-
