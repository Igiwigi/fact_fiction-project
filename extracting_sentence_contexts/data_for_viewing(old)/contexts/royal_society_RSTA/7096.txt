Ficure 21. Bethe’s factors ¢ for the two, three, and five levels.

giving ¢, as a function of 7. Figure 21 gives e, (curve 2) as a function of 9. ¢, is smaller than
1 only for values of 7 smaller than 0-5. Above 7 = 0-5 the only solution of (106) is e, = 1.
The temperature corresponding to 7 = 0-5 has been interpreted as the transition temperature
of the corresponding co-operative phenomenon:

ne = 0°5, kT./¢ = (2In2)-!~ 0-72. (107)

This value is higher than the value AT,/¢ ~ 0-57 (92) given by the correct treatment of
Onsager. On the other hand, the fact that ¢, = 1 above 7 = 0-5 cannot be interpreted from
a physical point of view, and shows only that the method is not correct. Actually ¢,; = 1
means, from the point of view of our problem, that the geometrical constraints have dis-
appeared above the transition temperature, and this is obviously impossible. According
to the definition of the factors ¢, they must be smaller than 1 at all temperatures.
