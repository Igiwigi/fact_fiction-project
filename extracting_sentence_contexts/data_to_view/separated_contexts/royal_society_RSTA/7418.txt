One of the most striking facts which emerge is that when a complex field-change
accompanies a flash within 3 km. the first perceptible effect is in 80% of cases a
negative change of field. If simple field-changes are included, the proportion of all
observed field-changes due to discharges within 3 km. in which the first detected
change is negative is just over 60Â°%,. At slightly greater distances, on the other hand,
the proportion of cases with a negative first process is much smaller.
