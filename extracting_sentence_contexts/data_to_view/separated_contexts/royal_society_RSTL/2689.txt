Ls GaLLors, one of the most acute, s0on found his difficulties from this canse
such, that he was obliged to confess himself unable to proceed, and leave to his 81e-
cessors the task of removing them. He had adduced sufficient. proof of the spinal
marrow, to which the nerves of respiration belong, being capable of its functions
independently of the brain; yet on the remoyal of a part of the brain, the medulla
oblongata, respiration ceases. This difficulty he acknowledges he sees no means of
removing, calling it * un des grands mysteres de la puissance neryeuse, mystere qui
sera devoil6 tot ou tard, et dont la d6couverte jettera la plus vive lumitre sur le me-
chanisme des fonctions de cette mervyeilleuse puissance,”

If the preceding facts be kept in view, it is evident without much consideration that
none of the functions of the sensitive have any other dependence on the powers of
the vital system, but for the due structure and wellbeing of their organs. The nature
of the functions of the vital system here requires more consideration. They include
respiration ; circulation ; those processes by which the secreted fluids are formed ;
those, namely the more immediately assimilating processes, by which our food is con-
verted into the various organs of our bodies, and such parts of them as have become
unfit for the purposes of life are separated and expelled, for all are in a state of
change ; and those by which the due temperature is maintained.
