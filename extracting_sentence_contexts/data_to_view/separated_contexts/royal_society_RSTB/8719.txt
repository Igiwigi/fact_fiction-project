Shotgun sequencing of the first ancient
mammalian genome

An alternative approach consisted of shotgun sequencing fol-
lowing aDNA ligation into bacterial plasmids [13,14]. This
could be done at large sequencing centres, though with two
major limitations. First, most of the sequences generated in
fact do not originate from the organism of interest, but
from environmental microbes that colonize the tissue after
deposition. Therefore, no more than 26.9kb of the cave
bear genome could be reconstructed with this approach
from a total of 14027 sequences [13]. The second limitation
was the heavy experimental load required for bacterial cloning.
