deaths, a Table of the numbers of the population living in a parish 80 constituted could be
immediately determined without any enumeration. Its deviations from the truth would
be accidental ; and they would be set right by taking the mean of many years. So also
from a simultaneous enumeration of the numbers living in each year of age, the two
columns d, and 7, of the life could be constructed without reference to any registry of
the deaths at different ages.

The mean age at death in such a community would express the mean lifetime, or the
expectation of life at birth; and the product of the number expressing the annual
births multiplied into the mean age at death would give the numbers of the popula-
tion.

The facts which a Life-Table expresses in numbers may be represented by the lines
of a figure; age (Â«) being indicated by the abscissas measured from 0, the numbers
living (1) at each age by the ordinates of a curve line, and the numbers living between
any two ages by the plane surface within the two ordinates, the curve line, and the
corresponding portion of the abscissa. The relative numbers living at the ages 20 and
21 are seen in the two lines of Plate XLII. fig. 1, over the ages 20 and 21; if the
deaths in the intervening year all occurred immediately after the age 20 was attained,
the numbers living would also be represented by the parallelogram having its two sides
equal to the ordinate over 21, and for its base the portion of the abscisxa between 20
and 21; but if all the deaths occurred only the instant before the age 21 was attained,
the height of the parallelogram would be represented by the ordinate over the age of 20.
The deaths occur at intervals between the two ages, so the numbers living, and the
lifetime which is passed between the two ages, are correctly represented by the curvi-
