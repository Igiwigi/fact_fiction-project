Allen’s results. For the remaining levels, rough indication of the width is given by the
notation s (sharp), & (wide), 4(2), 4(3) for increasing widths. ‘h’ is used for widths of about
0:3 to 2cm.~!, h(2) for 2 to 5cm.~! and A(3) for 5 to 10cm.~}.

FORBIDDEN LINES

Certain so-called forbidden combinations have been observed in Cur. Of these, the
4p?P—4f 2F are well known and have been the subject of experimental and theoretical work
by Sambursky (1931). He attributes their presence to forced dipole radiation. In the new
observations two forbidden lines have been found in the Schumann region. They are the
combinations 4s2S—7s2S and 4s?2S—852S. The lines are strong and of the same character,
and their positions are sufficiently exact to dispose of any doubt of their correct assignment.
No other 4s 2S-ns?S lines have been found in spite of the fact that most of them would fall
in spectral regions much more easily observed.

ZEEMAN EFFECT

The Zeeman effect in Cur was used in the early papers to assist in the identification of the
terms. No further observations appear to have been made since that time, and the old
observations with one exception are not sufficiently consistent to warrant a calculation of
g-factors. The exception is the 4p ?P—4d*D multiplet which has been shown by Green (1930)
to fit exceptionally well the formulae for the partial Paschen-Beck effect developed by
Darwin (1927).
