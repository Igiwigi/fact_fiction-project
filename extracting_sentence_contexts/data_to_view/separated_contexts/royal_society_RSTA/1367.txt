As to the various other types of base elements which can occur in H-systems of primals,
we find that they are either such that by the special nature of quadric transformations
they cannot occur at all in ¥’, or they are such that when they do occur their existence
can easily be detected—usually from a consideration of base elements which we know
already. For example, since any three ¥-primals must intersect in a residual conic
only, primals of ¥" cannot have an isolated base point of contact, nor can they even
touch a fixed plane at an isolated base point of the plane. Also, if all ‘Y-primals had
a surface of contact, its existence could be detected by the fact that any two ‘Y-primals
must intersect in a residual surface of known order ; and a curve of contact would also
be noticed in a similar way. In practice, such special types of base element are difficult
to deal with ; but as they mostly occur only in special limiting cases of more general
quadric transformations, we shall not have much to do with them in this paper. 4.
