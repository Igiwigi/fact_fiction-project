the house by a light horizontal shaft revolving under the surface of the ground,

The references to the details are given on the several Plates. Considering how many interests may be affected by the expected change in
the circumstances of the river Thames, by the removal of London Bridge, it
appears important that a similar gauge should be established at some point
above the bridge, 80 that by the corresponding charts of the two machines, the
facts will be 80 clearly exhibited as to defy that contradictory evidence which
interested persons might hereafter produce, as well as furnish valuable data
upon which remedial expedients might be founded. Since the completion of the machine above described, my attention has been
directed by Mr. LuBBock to the application of similar means for observing
accurately the times of high water, not only as a scientific inquiry upon the
tides generally, but with a view to the construction of accurate tide tables.
