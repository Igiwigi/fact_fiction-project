The means for every year of the eleven, and for every month of the
twelve, alike come out negative, and the preponderance of individual months in which
the effect is negative is overwhelming. The true secular change is here in the same
direction as the apparent non-cyclic effect, and so tends to increase it, but only to an
insignificant extent. In fact it requires only 10 average quiet days to bring about a
decrease in I equal to the secular change observed in an entire year. The absolute magnitude of the non-cyclic change in I, as we see from Table X.,
does not vary very conspicuously with the season of the year, but relative to the
range of the diurnal inequality it is most important in winter. In January, in fact, it
averaged fully 30 per cent. of the range of the proper cyclic diurnal variation.
