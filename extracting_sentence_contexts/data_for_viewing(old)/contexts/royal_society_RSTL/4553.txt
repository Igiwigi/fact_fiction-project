the reduction of the chromic acid, where no oxidation takes place, and the oxidation
of the body, are due to one and the same cause, namely, to the mutual attraction of
the elemental particles. When, for example, arsenious acid is oxidized by the action
of chlorine, I consider that the oxygen is oxidized as well as the arsenic. We are
led to the same conclusions by various well-known experiments; in the case, for ex-
ample, of the decomposition of the nitrate of ammonia on boiling, when this com-
pound breaks up into water and nitrogen, thusâ€”

while from no. point of view is it yery logical to draw a distinetion between two facts
s0 very similar as the formation of the water and the nitrogen, it is proved, by the
experiments I have cited, that the mutual attraction of the particles of the nitrogen
is a most important condition of the change.

'The transition from these cases of spontaneous decomposition to other instances, in
which no one of the substances usually called compound is formed, but the elements
alone are liberated, is obvious ; and I cannot but think that these phenomena, viewed
as the last of a series of chemical changes, proceeding from the simplest case of
double decomposition to the curious experiments I have just cited, each successive
link of which is bound to the preceding by the closest analogies, reasonably admit, of
a very different interpretation to that which we should put upon them when regarded
out of this connection. It is hard to draw a distinction between the decomposition
