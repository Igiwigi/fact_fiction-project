another section in my Cabinet (C. N. 381) identical in every feature with that studied
by Bronenrart, though in a much finer state of preservation.t In my figure we see
transverse sections of a number of vascular projections, ¢, of somewhat varied forms,
alternating with many small crescentic bays, not loops, in each one of which is
located the transverse section, c, of a leaf-trace.{ But in the young specimens now
under consideration these peculiar projections are scarcely visible. Their condition
is represented in Plate 3, fig. 6, which is a faithful transcript of a part of one of
these cylinders from the section in my Cabinet, 380a. Here we find that the already
liberated leaf-trace bundles, c’, of fig. 5, are much more prominent objects than the
projections, c, of the same figure.§

Before tracing the further course of these foliar bundles we must consider the
condition of the cortex in these young branches. One special fact connected with
an individual bundle of fig. 1 will be referred to later on.

Immediately investing, and in contact with, the periphery of the primary tracheal
cylinder, we have clear evidence of an extremely delicate thin-walled parenchymatous
tissue, which will be again considered on describing some vertical sections of these
young twigs. External to this delicate zone we have now a vacant area, c, from
which nearly every trace of structure has disappeared. Here and there are indications
that it was occupied by an outward extension of the delicate parenchyma already
described ; this merged gradually into the innermost portion of the next more external
cortical zone, d. The breadth of this vacant area is about ‘1.

In his restoration of LZ. Harcourtii, M. Bronentarr indicated that the boundary
