In particular, if the
carbon externality were the only market failure in the economy, it would be possible to create a
compensation package (through the tax-transfer system) that would make all consumers better
off and avoid ‘fuel poverty’. However, as the tax-transfer system in itself introduces multiple
distortions in consumer and producer choices, the carbon externality is, in practice, not the only
distortion and it interacts with multiple others. Under such circumstances, there is no guarantee
that a package that would make everyone better off is, in fact, technically feasible (e.g. [22]). Second, producers, in particular in the energy sector, are likely to lobby against environmentally
motivated regulation in general and carbon taxes in particular [23,24]. Again, it is possible to use
the tax revenue (or any initial allocation of tradeable permits) to compensate producers /polluters
[25,26] and in that way to reduce political opposition to the carbon price policy [27].
