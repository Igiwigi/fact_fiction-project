stage, where the inner wall in the middle, or near
the periphery of the calyx, is the only apparent wall, and may by constant self-
division of a polyp come to include several calyces. The epithecal deposit may
be almost abandoned or retained strictly as a means of attachment for the colony.
Meandroid colonies springing from quite different genera behave similarly in this
respect, and the stage is highly characteristic of the most advanced colonial types of
Astreeidee and Lophoserine.

The mere fact that the primitive basal and tangential structure went through these
evolutionary stages, makes it impossible to use the morphology of the theca us a
basis for the main subdivisions of Madreporaria. Clearly an Astrzid which was
directly descended from a Cyathophyllid might differ in this respect and have to be
placed in an entirely different subdivision from its ancestral types.

Again, species of Montlivaltia with an epitheca, and neither theca or pseudotheca
would possibly have to be removed from pseudothecate Astreids, similariy Microso-
lena from the Fungide and placed alongside of certain species of Zaphrentis and
other Paleozoic corals which also had not advanced beyond the primitive stage.
