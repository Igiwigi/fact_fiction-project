BOWERBANK ON THE ANATOMY

formed sponges, we $hall find in all cases that those organs exist only on the inner
surface of the great cloacal cavities. The construction of the interstitial cells is best demonstrated in a longitudinal section
of a dried specimen of Grantic ciliata, mounted in Canada balsam ; and in a specimen
50 prepared, spaces are seen between the cells, which are often nearly half the size of
the cells. These spaces are most probably produced by the contraction of the tissues
induced by the mode of the preparation of the object, and do not exist in the living
sponge ; but they serve admirably to demonstrate the fact that each interstitial cell has
its own special parietes, and that the divisions between the cells are not common to
adjacent cells. Plate LXXII. fig. 1, and (Part IT.)
