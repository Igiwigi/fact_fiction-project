light and of heat. I never could reconcile it with the supposi-

ResERvinG for a future communication, an account of the
sequel of my enquiries respecting the subject which I have un-
dertaken to investigate, I shall conclude this long Paper with
some obseryations, concerning the practical uses that may be
derived from a knowledge of the facts which have been esta-

In all cases where it is designed to preserve the heat of any
Substance which is confined in a metallic vessel, it will greatly
