growth of enstrophy max; €(f), cf. (2.7). It was obtained applying Laplace’s method to produce


an asymptotic representation for large € of the solution to (2.1) given in terms of the Cole-
Hopf formula. These results provide a rigorous and quantitative justification for the behaviour
of Burgers flows with initial data ig,¢,,7 obtained as local maximizers of Problem 2.2.

Since Problem 2.2 is non-convex and the numerical approach employed to solve it relies on
local optimality conditions, cf. appendix A, we of course cannot guarantee that the solutions
found for any & and T, cf. figure 1a,b, are global maximizers. However, the results reported in
[8] were obtained following a thorough search involving the use of many different, mutually
orthogonal (in the function space H}(Q)), and random initial guesses u, The optimal initial
conditions shown in figure la are in fact non-unique maximizers as their rescaled copies
(1/m)tio,¢,,7(mx), x € [0, 1], m= 2,3,..., were also found to be local maximizers, but characterized
by smaller values of €r. Further support for the conjecture that at least up to a certain value of &
the maximizers presented in figure 1a are in fact global maximizers was provided in [66], where
upper bounds on max;>9 €(t) revealing behaviour consistent with (2.7) were obtained based on
a Galerkin truncation of the Burgers system (2.1). We will discuss this important point in more
detail in §5.

An intriguing question, originally raised by Flandoli [67], is how extreme or singular
behaviour possible in solutions of hydrodynamic models may be affected by stochastic forcing.
More specifically, the question is whether via some interaction with the nonlinearity and
dissipation present in the system such stochastic forcing may enhance or weaken the growth
of certain solution norms as compared with the deterministic case. In particular, in the case
