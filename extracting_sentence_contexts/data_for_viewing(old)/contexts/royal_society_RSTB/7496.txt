edges, the suggestion of causal relationship is undeniably strong.

This method of growth postulated for the Amphibia by Marcus (1928), Heiss (1923), for
certain Mammalia by Hilber (1934) and Willson (1928), is the result of subdivision of space
by centripetal formation of septa. In the amphibian or reptilian lung, the free edges of the
septa, in addition to elastic fibres, contain large muscle bundles (Oppel 1905 : Schultze 1871),
no doubt capable of exerting traction on the septum to increase or diminish the area of
capillary bed according to the demand. It will make no difference to the argument
whether a positive pressure exists within the lung lumen to distend the lung (as in Amphibia)
or whether the lumen is enlarged by pressures lower than atmospheric outside the lung
(as in Mammalia). Both mechanisms will evoke elastic recoil, assisted in Amphibia by
contraction of plain muscle in the edges of the septa. Available evidence shows that the
facts of lung growth in the rabbit can be fitted more easily into this scheme than into

84 R. H. D. SHORT ON THE ALVEOLAR EPITHELIUM

the alternative scheme of alveolar budding supported by Bremer (1935). Whether or not the
desquamation of epithelium from the distal portion of the respiratory tree be accepted as
a fact (and strong evidence has been produced to show that this occurs in the foetus and
persists in the adult), epithelial growth cannot account for the quantitative facts of growth
of the lung lumen and its subdivision. Nor can it account for the fact that the structure of
a 5-day-old lung can be reproduced by simple inflation of one that has never breathed.
