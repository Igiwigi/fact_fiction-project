DAVY ON THE TEMPERATURE OF MAN. These results give an average temperature of 98:4, that of the air being about
55'5. They sbow a 8light relation between the temperature of the body and of the
air, but less perhaps than might be expected, and less unquestionably. than would
have been exhibited under circumstances not equally favourable for the preseryation
of an equable warmth, especially at night, in the uniform temperature of the Sitting-
room ; and when at rest, from warm bed-clothes, and during the day from sitting in
cold weather near a fire; and from the clothing then, as well as at night, being varied
with the degree of cold to be resisted, having in view the preserving of an agreeable
feeling, - the effect, and perhaps best sign of the happy temperate mean.:..Some facts
which I sball have presently to bring forward, may aid in illustrating the remark
just made.

3. Of the Effect of Active Ezercise on the Temperature. By active exercise, I mean that which occasions acceleration of the heart's action,
and of respiration, and commonly a feeling of increased warmth, such as fast walking
and riding, in contradistinetion to the passive kind, as that which is taken in an easy
carriage.

'The following detail exhibits the results of observations made immediately after
active exercise, in different months and under various circumstances :—
