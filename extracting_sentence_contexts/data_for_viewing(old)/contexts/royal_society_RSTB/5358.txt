is significant when coupled with its presence a mile to the south-east, in the Hangmanâ€™s
Elm Quarry. If we conceive the pebbles as derived from the erosion of a cliff, we must
suppose them to have been spread out on the sea bottom by means of an undertow,
or else swept from the shore by a river or rivers and spread out evenly by a long-shore
current. In either case, in view of the even distribution of the pebbles elsewhere, it
is more likely that they never reached Highworth than that they came over it or round
it from the north.

We seem, then, driven to adopt the view that one of the results of the earth-movements
preceding the formation of the Pebble Bed was the elevation of the north-western border
of the London massif and that part of the trough adjacent to it, and the production of
a range of cliffs of Oxford Clay. The coast was now probably north-west of its
position in Lower Calcareous Grit times. This conclusion is based on the fact that in
the exposure farthest down the dip-slope, that at Stanford in the Vale, the whole of
the Berkshire Oolites and Osmington Oolites together are only 6 ft. thick, while in the
Goosey boring, two miles farther south-east, they appear to be only 3 ft. thick. The
Lower Caleareous Grit at Goosey shows no such signs of thinning out [5, p. 45].

We must now turn to a consideration of the rest of the Berkshire Oolites, of which
the Pebble Bed is the basal member.

One of the results of the earth-movements of which the Pebble Bed is evidence was a
