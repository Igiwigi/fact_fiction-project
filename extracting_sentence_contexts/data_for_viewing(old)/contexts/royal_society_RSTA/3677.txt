determines the flow of money, energy and materials in the economy. Each occurs in a context
of increasing scale and influence, but with slower rates of change. The figure illustrates the
fact that at every level of scale, each grouping within any one of the three stakeholders has
some relationship with each level of the other two. A simple answer to the question ‘who can
do what to whom’ is therefore that either party in every one of the relationships in figure 13
could choose to act to influence the other towards reducing material demand. For example,
communities developing a shared sense of values about material consumption could act as a
lobby to influence national and international policy processes or, in reverse, policy could influence
the choices open to the community. Equally, marketing departments which develop the messages
that associate aspirations with particular products could promote alternative associations of
heritage and conservation, or the individuals to whom the messages are directed could choose to
contradict the marketeers’ intentions by refusing to support material waste in their purchasing.
At this rather abstract level, both at work and at home, every individual could act within the
relationships in which they are engaged to create influence towards reduced material demand.
