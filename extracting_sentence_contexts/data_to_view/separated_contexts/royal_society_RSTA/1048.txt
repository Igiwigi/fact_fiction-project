Both Monte Carlo as well as post-refinement use the recorded mean
energy as a single parameter needed to address the fluctuating X-ray spectrum, which has a
very fine structure [22,25]. It has been surprising therefore that when running the XFEL in a
self-seeded mode a strong improvement in the SFX data processing statistics was not seen [26]
as would be expected. Reliable quantification of all physical contributions to the uncertainty of


the measurement is in fact not yet obtained and future investigations would be of great interest
to the SFX community. Instead, the field is relying on averaging as a principle technique when
executing and processing multi-crystal SFX datasets of still images with high partiality, and
predictions of the sensitivity of difference measurements cannot generally be made with sufficient
statistical certainty. General protocols have now been developed for the successful execution of flash-induced
time resolved structural biology [27-29].
