more need they lose to suffer total annihilation?

The hypothesis that the alveolar wall is lined by a continuous nucleated epithelium
received support from Chrzonszczewsky (1863) using the silver technique. Modern
adherents of this view have come to rely less and less on silver impregnation, and the main
weight of the argument has ceased to be derived from normal lungs. Miller (1937) thus
relies upon pneumonia, Cowdry (1925) upon Jagziekte, a disease of sheep, and Young (1928)
upon experimental collapse of the lung. In relation to the silver nitrate method, the
difficulty of this school is to explain away the appearance of non-nucleated plates. Having
done so (Miller, 1937, pp. 59, 66) they are faced with a far more serious difficulty. The
number of nuclei in the normal alveolar septum is not sufficient to provide the highly
cellular epithelium which Miller illustrates (1937). Josselyn (1935) had already called
attention to the fact that nuclei, other than those of endothelial cells, ‘are so few in number
in most cases that they appear quite incidental’. This aspect is considered in detail in the
next section.

Nuclear counts of the alveolar septum of the adult rabbit

In thick sections of the lung where it is possible to study the whole extent of an alveolar
septum, it is a striking fact that the distribution of nuclei is not regular. In material of
which the capillary bed has been injected by weakly coloured carmine-gelatin, and subse-
quently counterstained by haematoxylin, surprisingly large areas are devoid of any nuclei
whatever (see figure 33).

Assuming that the capillary bed of the alveolus is invested by endothelial cells, it should
