More might be said on this subject ; but I feel anxious to
avoid, as much as possible, controversial discussion. It is my . wish not to advance opinions, but simply to state some facts,
which I have met with in the course of my physiological in-
vestigations. These facts, I am willing to hope, possess some
value; and they may perhaps lead to the developement of other
facts of much greater importance. Physiology is yet in its in-
fant state.
