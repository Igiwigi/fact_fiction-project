At low acid concentrations, the effects of hydrolysis time were shown to be more significant,
as the formation of sulfate half-esters on CNC surfaces occurs relatively slowly. At high acid
concentrations, the effects of time are less significant, as CNC sulfate content increases sharply
and levels off [19]. The strong effect of acid concentration on the sulfate content for CNCs
hydrolysed with sulfuric acid is directly related to the fact that sulfuric acid is a strong acid and
is known to catalyse the esterification of cellulose [54]. As mentioned, CNCs hydrolysed with phosphoric acid have roughly one-tenth of the surface
charge density of those hydrolysed with sulfuric acid. This is likely related to the fact that
phosphoric acid is a weaker acid that is not entirely dissociated in solution and does not catalyse
esterification to the same extent as sulfuric acid.
