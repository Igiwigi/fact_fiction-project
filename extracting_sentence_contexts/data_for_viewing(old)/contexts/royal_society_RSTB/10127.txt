fishing is contested. For example, Taylor [29] challenged the
claim that the Tasmanians did not eat fish at the time of contact
with Europeans. She highlighted historical records that suggest
at least some Tasmanians consumed fish when Europeans
arrived on the island. Bassett [30] questioned the hypothesis
from a different direction. He argued that the size and taxo-
nomic composition of the fish bones examined by Jones are
such that they were probably in the digestive tracts of seals
caught by Tasmanians and therefore do not tell us anything
about the latter’s fishing abilities. Neither of these arguments
is free of problems, but they clearly demonstrate that the idea
that the Tasmanians lost the ability to fish cannot be taken to
be a fact, contrary to what Henrich implied.

Another important problem with the fishing-related part
of the cultural decline hypothesis concerns the assumption
that a failure to eat fish is maladaptive. Henrich presented
this as self-evident, and to be another good reason to think
that something must have been preventing the Tasmanians
from doing it—that something being their small population
size. For example, at one point in his paper, he discussed
one of the obvious potential implications of Bassett’s [30]
‘seal butchery by-product’ hypothesis, namely that the
Tasmanians did not ever fish. Henrich suggested that this
would not undermine his argument about the importance
