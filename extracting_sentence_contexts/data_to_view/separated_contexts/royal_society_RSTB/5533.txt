(These results are given in Part IX.) In addition, all the different strains grow well on the medium used, and none of them
gives rise to appreciable amounts of titratable acidity. In fact, three strains, Ac. 79,
Ac. 80 and Ac. 9, actually bring about a reduction in the initial acidity of the medium. All strains give rise to amounts of volatile acids which, while small in themselves, are
large in comparison with those formed by other groups, e.g., the A. glaucus group. Group 6.â€”A. versicolor-A. Sydowi group.
