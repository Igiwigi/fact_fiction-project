To begin with conceptual i#

combinations, consider e.g. the experiment in which the properties a,b and measurements A,B
are identified as shown in table 7. Such an experiment would yield table 6 unless the participants
choose to deliberately give wrong responses. There is, in fact, nothing wrong in considering
the conceptual inferences like ‘Green Triangle is Green’ and ‘Green Triangle is Triangular’ as
examples of contextuality or ‘(super-quantum) entanglement,’ but this looks to us as making the
concept of contextuality too trivial to be of interest. Another example of ‘conceptual entanglement’ involves creation of new concepts in children
by means of teaching them a simple nonsense verse:

Pips and Nips are Zops, not Zogs. Pops and Nops aren’t Zops nor Zogs.
