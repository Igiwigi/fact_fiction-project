So clearly Ciamician’s
vision is becoming highly topical in the context of the current sustainability agenda but what is
making a real difference are technical advances in reactor engineering which remove many of the
engineering barriers that have hamstrung larger scale photochemistry for so long. Indeed, the
authors of the Principles of Circular Chemistry have themselves written, ‘There is a strong ambition
towards developing chemically renewable energies, for example, solar-driven chemistry’. Many of the problems of scaling up photochemical reactions are associated with the fact that
a photochemical reaction requires absorption of light and this absorption limits the penetration
distance of that light into the solution. Thus, there is a choice; either one must have a strongly
stirred reactor so that all of the reaction mixture is swept past the light source or, alternatively,
one can design a reactor in which the thickness of reaction mixture is small, for example, in a long
narrow tube or within a falling film. Sunlight is highly directional and can be easily focussed onto


a reaction vessel, although longer wavelength light needs to be filtered out to prevent overheating
of the reaction mixture and, of course, the position of the sun changes throughout the day.
