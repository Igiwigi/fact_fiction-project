In view
of these considerations, therefore, the results yielded by such experiments must not be
regarded as having any conclusive bearing on the question before us. And as these or
s1milar objections apply to various other modes of section by which I have endeavoured
to settle this question, I will not here occupy space in detailing them. It seems
desirable, however, in this connexion again to mention a fact briefly stated in my former
paper, namely, that section conclusively proves a contractile wave to have the power,
when it reaches a lithocyst, of stimulating the latter into activity ; for * it is not diffi-
cult to obtain a series of lithocysts connected in snch a manner that the resistance offered
to the passage of the waves by a certain width of the junction-tissne is 8uch as just to
allow the residuum of the contractile wave which emanates from one lithocyst to reach
