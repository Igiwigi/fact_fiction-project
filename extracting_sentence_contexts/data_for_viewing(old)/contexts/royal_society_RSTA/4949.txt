An important issue for many types of anisotropy is the scale over which the mean magnetic field is
defined. For a local mean field, Bic, it might be the same scale as that of the considered fluctuations,
or perhaps 2, 5 or 10 times that. Studies employing either wavelets or structure functions now
commonly take this approach. For a global mean field, Bo, the averaging occurs over the whole
data interval (or simulation domain), so that Bo is uniform. The particular mean field used can
lead to significant differences in results [23,100,101]. Possibly the most well-known solar wind
case concerns the energy spectrum and how the inertial range slope depends on the angle between
the measurement direction and the direction of Bo or Bic, No systematic difference in slopes is
seen when a global field is used, but steeper spectral slopes are seen at small angles when local
mean fields are employed (see [6] for a review).

Note that wavelet ‘spectra’ computed relative to local mean fields are, in fact, not spectra in the
classical second-order moment sense [23]. Rather, because the direction of Bloc is itself a random
variable, wavelet ‘spectra’ also involve third- and higher-order correlations.

Recall that the properties of linear wave modes are typically derived assuming a homogeneous
background with a mean magnetic field that is uniform and constant [126]. If one wishes to
investigate the properties of wave modes relative to a BI, this is clearly a more complicated
situation. In the extreme cases where Bic is defined over the same scale as the fluctuations,

SThis is closely related to the correlation scale and the energy-containing scale [13,18].

7When the electron gyrofrequency is reached the behaviour changes again, with claims for powerlaws, exponential
dependence and combinations of these. See [4] and references therein.
