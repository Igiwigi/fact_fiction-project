Critically, although the complement locus ‘b’ was
never explicitly introduced, it is nonetheless available for
interpretation. Schlenker et al. [13] argue that the complement
interpretation is available solely by virtue of the geometric
properties of the locations traced in signing space. Namely,
the fact that the small locus is contained within the larger
locus allows the third (complement) locus to come into
existence and to be available for reference. Schlenker et al. [13] suggest that there is a structured
mapping between the geometric configuration of the circu-
lar loci traced in signing space and the semantic
denotations of those loci. This type of structural iconicity
is not available for spoken language.
