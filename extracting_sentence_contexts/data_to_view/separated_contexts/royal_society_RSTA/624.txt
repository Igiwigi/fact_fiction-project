We shall make frequent use of this principle in what
follows. A reduction of this type will be called an invariant reduction, and when it is necessary
to emphasize the invariant nature of the reduction the equivalence sign will be replaced
by the symbol =. It may also happen that a particular form whose symbolic expression involves a symbol
p (or a symbol f used as a suffix) can be shown to be reducible without making use of the
fact that a symbolic product containing a factor p, is reducible, and without splitting p up
into a pair of equivalent symbols (â€™). If this is the case we can clearly replace p by any
cogredient combination of symbols. This process will also be used, on occasion, in the course
of the work.
