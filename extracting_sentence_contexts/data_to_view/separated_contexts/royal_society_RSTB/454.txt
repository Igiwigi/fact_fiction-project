On the one hand, there is no evidence of strict
segmentation in the branches distributed peripherally from these cords ; and, on the
other hand, the parts over which they preside—the heart, blood-vessels, lungs,
intestinal tract, &e.—are all morphologically unsegmented, like other parts and organs
in the Mammalian trunk which are longitudinally placed. The cerebro-spinal axis,
the notochord, heart, vascular system, alimentary canal and diverticula, ureters, &c.,
present no signs of being developed in a segmental manner. In fact, it might be
formulated as a morphological law, to which the sympathetic cord is no exception—
that longitudinally-placed structures, whether single and median, or laterally placed,
are primarily and uniformly unsegmented.*

2. From the morphological point of view, however, the most important conclusions
derived from the investigations recorded above are undoubtedly the following :—

a. The independent origin of the sympathetic system, and its secondary connexion
with the cerebro-spinal system.
