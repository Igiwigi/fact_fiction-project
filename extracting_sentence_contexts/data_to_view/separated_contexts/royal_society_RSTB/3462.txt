We have definitely
repudiated the idea (p. 88) that these masses are the first beginnings or Anlagen
of the definitive somites. It has been pointed out that their area is not at all
coincident with that broad paraxial zone of mesoderm which becomes the site of the,
then impending, differentiation of definitive somites. On the contrary, the zone of
origin of the protosomites is in fact coincident only with the lateral extent of the
primitive archenteron, and they are represented further forwards by the lateral
portions of the archenteric plate, in which, too, indications of a serial segmental
differentiation are less definitely recognisable. The protosomites, or, at least, their
major portions, do, however, ultimately merge in the neighbouring paraxial
mesoderm, and this is likewise the case with their serial homologues, the marginal
portions of the archenteric plate. But the mesoderm so contributed to the broad
paraxial zone is trifling in amount, nor has this protosomitic segmentation any
recognisable relation to the definitive somitic segmentation, numerical or other.
