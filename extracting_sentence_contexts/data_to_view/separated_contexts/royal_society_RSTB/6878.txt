Above the level of figure 22 it will be seen (figure 23) that a solenostelic
vascular system is present, this being the stele of the axillary bud. Figure 24, near the
bud apex, shows the first leaf of the bud. Mention may also be made of the fact that in other experiments in which a leaf pri-
mordium was isolated on the same panel of tissue as the apical meristem, the subsequent
development of the leaf was very limited and compared closely with those described above. By contrast, the leaves which developed in the isolated terminal region and in lateral buds
were of relatively large size.

5. THE GROWTH OF THE ISOLATED LATERAL SEGMENTS

Not only do isolated meristems continue to grow but the lateral segments (which are
separated from each other and from the central meristem by the intersecting incisions)
also undergo further growth during which new and hitherto unrecorded morphological
developments take place.
