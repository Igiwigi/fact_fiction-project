hypothesis?

Not surprisingly, proponents of the population size hypo-

thesis have argued that there is something wrong with

the hunter-gatherer studies. Most prominently, Henrich

[52] has questioned the population size estimates used in

the contact-era hunter-gatherer studies.

Even leaving aside the fact that it ignores the archaeological
studies that also refute the hypothesis, there are two reasons to
reject this criticism. One is that most of the hunter-gatherer popu-
lation size estimates [46-49] were obtained in the same way as the
ones for the food-producers [6,7]. Given that the latter support the
hypothesis, there is no reason to think that the former are biased
against finding an association between population size and
technological complexity. Significantly, proponents of the popu-
lation size hypothesis have repeatedly cited the results of the
food-producer studies in a positive manner [26,53].

The other reason to reject Henrichâ€™s criticism relates to the
fact that several of the hunter-gatherer studies indicate that
