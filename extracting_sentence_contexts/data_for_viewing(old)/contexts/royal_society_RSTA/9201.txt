boundary, as the terms which effectively take their place do not involve any variable
part of the energy. This result will be demonstrated in this section. But since, as
will be shown, they cannot be neglected in the case of non-cubic structures, the problem
of pyrrhotite will be also considered.

In his thesis, Dz Waarp devotes a section to ‘‘ Atomistiese Theorie von het Ferro-
magnetisme.”” Therein he has adopted the conception of simple doublets, which are
responsible for the third-order terms in 1/r in the energy-function. His method of
dealing with these terms does certainly give a complete, though only formal, solution.
Unfortunately the results involve series of terms each of which is a complicated Hankel
function, and it is extremely difficult to check results by numerical data. We shall,
however, follow his methods and obtain results slightly more general than his, and
establish only qualitative agreement with experimental facts.

assume at first that there is saturation. According to our fundamental assumptions let
(1, m, m) and (I, m M2) denote the directions in which the elements in L, and L, lattices
respectively are pointing, in the presence of an external homogeneous field H. Now, on
the macroscopic theory of magnetism, uniform magnetization of a body is secured in
presence of a homogeneous field if (i) the body is continuous, and if, further (ii), it is
bounded by a surface of the second degree. To avoid the theoretical difficulties,
