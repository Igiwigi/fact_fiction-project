Such short wave-lengths are
supplied by several metallic sparks, and are freely transmitted through hydrogen. Nevertheless it seems difficult to believe that, even if emitted by the hottest portion
of the sun’s envelope, they are not absorbed again by the surrounding cooler layers. We are not, therefore, at present in a position to assert that sufficiently short wave-
lengths can enter the atmosphere and be absorbed in the outer layer, thereby causing
ionisation, but we know so little about the conditions of the uppermost layers that
we may reasonably retain the view that the powerful ionisation of the air, which we
must consider to be an established fact, is a direct effect of solar radiation. If we turn to the possibility of a direct injection of ions by the sun into our
atmosphere, we have to deal with the alternatives of supposing that ions of both kinds
are introduced or only those of one kind. The second alternative must be rejected at
once, because a simple calculation shows that the outward force due to the volume
