3. Energy conditions

The weak, strong and null energy condition are physical requirements that we wish our solutions
to fulfil. They can help us single out those solutions of equations (2.13)-(2.15) as more plausible
from a physics point of view. Classically, it is convenient to translate the energy conditions to
restrictions imposed on p and p.

To work out the energy conditions for our type of fluid, we start by noting that in the
formulation of the field equations, both the metric given by (2.1) and the bulk fluid described


by (2.8) and (2.12), appear as static with respect to the time coordinate t, because the evolution is
taken with respect to the fifth spatial coordinate Y. Using this fact, we can reinterpret our fluid
analogue as a real anisotropic fluid having the following energy momentum tensor:

Tap = (0° + pu — p°gapd45h — Pygssd4 5p, G1)

where u%, = (a(Y),0,0,0,0), A,B=1,2,3,4,5 and aw, 8 =1,2,3,4. When we combine (2.8) with (3.1),
we get the following set of relations:

PY=—p, (3.2)

p°=-p (3.3)

and po =p. (3.4)
