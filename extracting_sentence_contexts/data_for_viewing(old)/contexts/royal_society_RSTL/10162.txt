earth which also gave the citron band strongly.

An acid solution of the citron body was precipitated by ammonia aud ammonie
chloride. The earth was nob completely precipitated, but after a long boiling some
remained in s80lution. I have since ascertained that the detection of the citron-band
body in s0lution under these cireumstances is only owing to the marvellous delicacy
of the test, which carries our powers of recognition far beyond the resources of
ordinary chemistry.

38. Bexides obtaining indirect evidence that the citron band was not due to certain
elements, I tried special experiments with each substance, brought to the highes
possible state of purity. In many cases I detected more or less traces of citron band ;
but I had come to the conelusion, abundantly warranted by facts, that this eitron
band was an extraordinarily sensitive test of the presence of the element causing it ;
and the minute chemistry of many of these earthy metals being insufficiently known,
it was not surprising that traces of one of them should adhere to another in spite of
repeated attempts to purify it out. With each 8uccessive fractional precipitation the
citron band became fainter, showing that with perseverance the last trace would
probably disappear. The time this process would have occupied, in my opinion,
seemed not, worth the little additional evidence it would have afforded.

39. Taking into consideration the extremely small quantity of phosphorescent
material which had so far been obtained, all these experiments justified me in
assuming that the body sought for not only belonged to the group of earths, but
als0 most- probably to the sub-group not precipitated by potassic sulphate to which
