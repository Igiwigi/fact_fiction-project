The values observed and calculated seem in every case to confirm the theo-
retical deductions made by Lord RAYLEIGH. A comparison of the curves, fig. 9, Plate 25, of the absorbed and unabsorbed lights
will show the modifications which are effected in the spectrum by passing the beam of
light through a turbid medium. That the waves of shorter Jength are more absorbed
than the longer is clear, from the fact that the position of maximum intensity is
n. shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. Tt, will be observed that the clear
q water and glass ends of the trough even have somewhat affected the spectrum, for
there is less convexity in the curve on both sides of the maximum than in the normal

curve of the are crater, in fact, this former curve more nearly rezembles that of sun-
light. Now we have already shown in previous papers that the solar spectrum gives
evidence of the light having passed through a considerable quantity of water © stuff,”
and if the sunlight before it reaches our atmosphere has anything in common with
the light emitted by the carbon, the modification of the latter in passing through the
trough of water would be a further confirmation of our view.
