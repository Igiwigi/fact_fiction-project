owing to quantum effects, and between descriptions of elastic scattering, momentum transfer
and viscosity. As mentioned by these authors, this work can be improved including the effects of
inelastic collisions.

Figure 1 shows the ohmic diffusion, Hall term and ambipolar diffusion where Osterbrock
[134] was used to calculate the ion-neutral collision frequency. The simulation is 2.5D and
ranges from the upper convection zone to the lower corona including radiative transfer with
scattering from the photosphere to the corona [138,139], thermal conduction along the magnetic
field lines and partial ionization effects using the Bifrost code (see [96] and references therein).
The initial magnetic field is unipolar with a mean unsigned field strength of 5 G in the corona.
The convective motions build enough magnetic field stress to self-consistently maintain the hot
corona [6,7,10,15,140]. Note that the magnetic field is vertical in the corona (figure 1a), and
despite the fact that our simulations do not include imposed flux emergence, the dynamics in the
simulation and the convective motions accumulate horizontal magnetic field in the sub-adiabatic
photosphere. As mentioned above, this horizontal field will in principle be constrained to the
sub-adiabatic photosphere [85,86]. In addition, magnetic field footpoints will move around. Note
that these simulations naturally reproduce several of the energy generating drivers discussed in
§2. Moreover, the energy flux through the atmosphere will be modified by the physical processes
considered in the model as it propagates upwards towards the corona as mentioned above (see
[96] and compare with §3).
