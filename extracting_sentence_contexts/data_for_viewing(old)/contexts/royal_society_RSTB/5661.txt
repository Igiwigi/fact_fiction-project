Subsection 1. Velutina-elliptica-magna.

The species examined in this group (Ad. 52, Ad. 81 and Ad. 102) consists of three strains
of P. digitatum Saccarpo, obtained from different parts of the world. The carbon
balance sheets are given in Table III. The most striking feature of these carbon
balance sheets, which are all of the same type, is the relatively large figure obtained
for “ carbon in H,8O,.” The figure obtained with these three strains is about ten times
as large as that obtained with any other species in any genus examined. It is shown in
Part XVIII of this series that the substance responsible for this high figure is ethyl
acetate, and this species appears to be unique in the production, at any rate in
considerable quantities, of this ester. The production of this ester is further indicated
by the fact that cultures of this species, grown under the conditions of the metabolism
experiments, have a very agreeable ester smell.

Further points of interest in the carbon balance sheets are (a) the large amounts of
“carbon in volatile neutral compounds,” which have been shown to be due to ethyl
alcohol (see Part XVIII), and (6) the relatively high respiration coefficient.
