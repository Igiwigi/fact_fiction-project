The gold-bismuth and silver-bismuth curves are exactly sunilar ; the alloys of gold and
bismuth conducting less than those of silver and bismuth, as would be expected, as silver
is a better conductor than gold. .

From the similarity of the curves of alloys, where we may assume, from their chemical
behaviour, that we have only a solution of one metal in another, we may always draw
approximatively the curve of the alloys of any two metals, if we know to which class
they belong. Thus before a single copper-gold alloy had been determined, the curve
was almost correctly drawn, and agreed with that which was afterwards found by expe-
riment.

'That some alloys are chemical combinations may be deduced from the following
facts â€”

1. At the turning-points of the curve we generally find the alloys contract or expand.

2. There is no regular form of curve (se those of gold-tin, gold-lead, and silver-
copper), 80 that it cannot be & priort even approximatively represented.

3. At the turning-points the alloys contain large per-centages of each metal.

4. At the turning-points of the curyes the alloys are different from each other in
appearance (crystalline form, &c. ).

Now let us for a moment examine the gold-tin curve, it being the only nearly com-
