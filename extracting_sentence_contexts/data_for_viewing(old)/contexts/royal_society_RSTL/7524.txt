OF THE BLADDER AND PROSTATE. 19

Gacnt* and SanToRINIF 8tate that at the points where the ureters terminate in the
bladder there arises from each of them a thick, round, compact, fleshy body, which
takes a downward direction, and having proceeded a little way, unites with its fellow
and terminates in the caput gallinaceum. The bodies referred to were described by
Lizvravp f under the term © La trigone de la vessie,” and Sir CHARLES BELL regarded
them as distinct muscles. This anatomist believed that they terminated in the third
lobe of the prostate, and not in the caput gallinaceum, as ayerred by MoRGAGNI and
SanToORINI. In this, however, as I shall have occasion to show, he was mistaken.

The accounts given of the distribution of the fibres in the prostate are few in number,
from the fact that the authors who have turned their attention to the anatomy of the
gland have for the most part described either its microscopical structure or pathological
conditions. Eris regards the prostate as being. essentially a muscular body, con-
sisting of circular or orbicular involuntary fibres, which are directly continuous behind
with the circular fibres of the bladder, and in front with the circular fibres of the
membranous portion of the urethra. It is, in his estimation, © only a largely developed
portion of the circular muscular layer that invests all the urethra behind the bulb, or
the spongy portion.” The few longitudinal fibres which, according to ELLIs, occur on
the upper surface of the prostate, are, he says, derived from the external layer of the
bladder, and can scarcely be said to form part of the gland. According to HopGsoxy, the
prostate is made up of two structures, a soft yellowish series of vesicles and their ducts,
and a more or less firm tissne laid between the glandular matter and connecting it toge-
ther. The firm tissue in some instances forms the greater part of the gland, and in his
