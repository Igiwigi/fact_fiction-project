taking place. Moreover, in this non-conjugating strain, successive generations of
individuals have never been kept isolated, so that there has always been ample
opportunity for syngamy to occur, if any of the individuals could or would
conjugate.* This, however, they are never able to do; as the age of any culture
increases, the flagellates gradually, all die off. Certainly in this case, the loss of
syngamy must be considered due to. the ample supply of “constant” nutrition and to
the removal of the excess of toxic products from the environment (by continually sub-
culturing). ;

So far as these facts lead, therefore, they appear to me to indicate that syngamy is
not due to some inherent factor in living protoplasm (7.¢., for the purpose of inducing
variations),+ but is primarily a reaction of the differentiated cell to its environment.

In a recent paper} Wooprurr and ErpMANN have deseribed a process of nuclear
reorganisation, without cell-fusion, occurring in one of their races of “ non-conjugating ”

‘“e

Paramecium, which they term “ endomixis.” From their observations they conclude
that the cell has an internal regulatory phenomenon, endomixis, which is self-
suflicient for the life of the race. From other observations made on mass-cultures,
they consider that endomixis and conjugation may occur simultaneously among
