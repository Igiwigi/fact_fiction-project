one suggested here appears to be consistent with the experimental data in question. : =

Iam, it goes without not saying, not contending that the Bayesian approach does not work Sy
in general in physics and beyond: there are many situations where it does, for example, when 2
we need to estimate the probabilities of certain human events, as in betting on the outcome of aed
a basketball game. Indeed, even in quantum experiments, one could make any predictions one a
likes or must in view of one’s prior experience, which need not be based on quantum mechanics : 8
or physics in general. However, the question is that of the effectiveness of our predictions in DNS
physics, of who will do better in physics, in predicting, betting on, the outcomes of experiments. : z
Consider, again, the double-slit experiment. One will ‘win’ with quantum mechanics in hand :s

against those who do not know it or whose theory is not as good, but one would win, or would
not consistently lose, only in many trials, which fact implicitly contains statistics. This is far from
insignificant and is a powerful reason to use quantum mechanics for predicting the outcomes of
quantum experiments. My point is only that quantum mechanics, in general, offers one no help
in betting on the outcome of a single experiment, because one cannot rigorously predict what
happens, although quantum mechanics can do so in practice in some experiments.

6. Quantum-like models beyond physics

Most currently used models in biology, cognitive psychology and economics are either classical-
like statistical models or (probabilistic or statistical) models based in chaos and complexity
theories. In many cases, these models work reasonably well. However, there also appear to
be phenomena in considering which they do not appear to be effective or work at all: their
predictions fail, similarly to the way such models failed in the case of quantum phenomena, which
