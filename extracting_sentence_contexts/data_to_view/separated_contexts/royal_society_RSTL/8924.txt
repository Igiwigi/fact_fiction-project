effect which the more or less perfect withdrawal of the air from the infusions would haye
upon the development of life. A few experiments with an ordinary air-pump were, in the first instance, made, The
necks of a series of bulbs charged with turnip-infusion were drawn out at the middle to
a tube of very small diameter. The open end of the neck being connected with the
air-pump, the bulbs were exhausted.
