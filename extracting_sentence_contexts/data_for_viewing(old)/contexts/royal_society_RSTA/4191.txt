6. Traditional understanding of contextuality translated into the contextuality-
by-default language

In accordance with the CbD approach, Rj and Re (c #c’) are a priori different random variables,
and since they are never observed ‘together’ (in any empirically grounded sense of this word),
they do not posses a joint distribution. The conceptual coherence and advantages offered by this
understanding of random variables recorded in different contexts has been discussed in [1,9,21].
In the framework of KPT this means that Rj and Re are functions defined on two different
probability spaces:

RE:Sc {-1,41} and RO:S¢ > {-1,+1}. (6.1)

It is therefore impossible to hypothesize that Rj and RE (c 4c’) are in fact ‘the same’. Nor is it
possible to treat these Ri and RE as ‘different but always equal to each other’,

Pr[Ro =RG]=1, (6.2)

since this statement also implies a joint distribution of (R§, Ro), translating into S; = Se’.


To formulate the analogue of the context-irrelevance hypothesis within the framework of CbD,
one has to use the foundational notion of a (probabilistic) coupling.
