So that a stream of air rich in oxygen will be drawn down the
intercellular spaces, and thence diffusing into the vessels, will produce the excess of
oxygen often found in them,

60 DR. A. J. EWART ON THE ASCENT OF WATER IN TREES. Section 13.—The Influence of Death on Flow. The fact that the water flows equally well up or down cut stems appears to indicate
the absence of any vital pumping action, for this would naturally tend to favour flow
in the customary direction. Furthermore, SrraspurGER killed stems for considerable
distances (as much as 10 metres) and observed that the parts above remained fresh
for some time. The proof is not perfectly satisfactory, since in the case of a large
tree, the trunk and branches may contain sufficient available water when fully
saturated for from 1-3 weeks’ transpiration.
