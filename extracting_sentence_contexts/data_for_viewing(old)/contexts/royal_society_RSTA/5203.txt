U is the mean flow velocity and D is the pile diameter. Both simulations show a clear shift from
lower to higher S; as z/h increases, indicating more frequent shedding of vortices further from the
bed. The shift in Strouhal number clearly shows that the vortex shedding occurs in two separate
cells, rather than one cell of domain height. This shift is observed to be around z/h = O(0.2) for
both domains (i =2D and 3D). Regarding the effect of domain height on the scour, Sumer &
Fredsoe [33, fig. 3.26] show that the boundary layer thickness has a clear effect on the scour depth
up to a boundary layer thickness to pile diameter ratio equal to 4. Also, it can be seen from figure 5
that the spectral peaks for = 2D are rather irregular (composed of multiple peaks rather than just
one peak at one frequency) compared with the ones given for i = 3D. However, the highlight of
this section might be given as the behaviour of vortex-shedding changes close to the bottom due
to the bottom shear effect. One final note with regard to the vortex-shedding frequency is that the
values of the Strouhal number are apparently different from the familiar value 0.2. This is linked
with the fact that the mean flow velocity U is used when normalizing the frequency, rather than
the ‘local’ approach velocity.
