The slowly-cooled alloy (figs. 32 and 33), containing 0Â°7 atomic per cent. of gold,
is near the bottom of the branch JI, the quantity of AuAl, present is insufficient to
saturate the aluminium, and, therefore, during the process of solidifying, the
aluminium has crystallised first on the walls of the crucible, perceptibly con-
centrating the opaque AuAl, in the central portion of the ingot.

The Bodies B, D, E, X, and H.

The body B, pure at 20 atoms of aluminium, to which we attribute the formula
Au,Al, was obtained in the form of a brittle rod of white with a faint yellow
tinge. It has a silky conchoidal fracture. Although containing little more than
3 per cent. by weight of the white aluminium, the colour of the gold is gone,
in fact there is no free gold in it. This alloy is more easily attacked by etching
reagents than pure gold, or than the D and E bodies, hence, after etching, we
never see it as a white body but as yellow or brownish purple from a film of finely
divided gold. D and E are pure white bodies, both before and after etching with
bromine or aqua regia. Fused caustic potash dissolves out the aluminium from
them and leaves them with a golden surface. They also break with a conchoidal
fracture, and are hard and brittle.

The X body, which we think may be AuAl, has not been obtained pure in large
masses, but a slowly-cooled alloy with 45 atoms of aluminium contains pure white
patches of X; these are soft. The X body when in contact with Au,Al is very
rapidly attacked and eaten away by bromine or aqua regia, leaving a grey finely
lined surface with the more resistant Au,A1 in relief:
