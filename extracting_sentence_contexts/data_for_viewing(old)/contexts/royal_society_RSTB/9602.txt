While clinicians have mainly noted when the presence of
one pathogen species complicates treatment of another [97],

Acknowledgements. I thank C. Lively and the various iterations of his

laboratory group for thought-provoking discussion on the mainten-

many probiotics are thought to be due in part to their on previous versions of this manuscript.
