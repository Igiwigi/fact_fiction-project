We
have seen that menstruation in the Primates is the physiological homologue of the
procestrum in the lower Mammalia, and that ovulation in the Bitch takes place during
cestrus or after the occurrence (or at any rate the commencement) of internal
bleeding. Consequently Statsmunv’s theory becomes untenable. This difficulty
in the way of the theory that “women menstruate because they do not conceive,”
as Powers expressed it, is alluded to in the memoirs on the cestrous cycle in the
Sheep and Ferret (MArsHALL, 1903, 1904), but with these animals the matter is
somewhat complicated by the facts that with the former it is not clear whether
ovulation does not sometimes occur during the procestrum, and with the latter it
may require the additional stimulus of coition before it can be induced.t

* The Pfliiger-Strassmann theory, although it does not assume that ovulation must necessarily occur
before menstruation or “ heat” can be induced, presumably requires us to infer that ripe (or nearly ripe)
follicles are present in the ovary at the commencement of each menstrual or “ heat” period, and that the
latter can only occur when the follicles reach a stage nearly approaching maturity and consequently acquire
a definite degree of protrusion.

+ Rerrerer (1892), has suggested a similar theory to account for the congestion during the Bitch’s
procestrum which he appears to regard as comparable to the albuminous secretion in the oviduct of a Fowl. CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PHYSIOLOGY OF MAMMALIAN REPRODUCTION. 115

Brearp (1897) has advanced a modification of Srctsmunv’s theory, in which he
assumes that the whole of the phenomena of menstruation represent a process which
is of the nature of an “abortion of something prepared for an egg given off at or
after the close of the preceding menstruation, and [that] it takes place because this
egg has escaped fertilization.” “ Prior to the appearance of the menses the uterus
has formed a decidua, which is regarded as equivalent to that which would arise
when a fertilized egg became affixed to the uterus.” This theory necessitates the
assumption that there is no correspondence between the procestrum of the lower
mammals and menstruation in the Primates, since the degenerative stage of the
procestrum in the Bitch or Ferret can hardly be of the nature of an abortion of
something prepared for an ovum which was discharged at the preceding “heat”
period which occurred many months before. The difficulty becomes still greater
when we consider the case of those animals referred to in the first section of this
paper on the cestrous cycle, which experience cestrus only once annually or, as in
some cases, even less often, for it can hardly be supposed that these animals ovulate
at more frequent periods than those at which they come “on heat.”* But Bearp
denies that there is any correspondence between “the heat period or rut of
mammals” and menstruation in the higher forms, failing to distinguish the
procestrum from the period of cestrus, a distinction which was first pointed out by
Hearse (1900).
