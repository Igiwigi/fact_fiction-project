47. These phenomena demonstrate the existence of a sys-
tem of currents radiating towards every molecule of the crust
on the surface. In consequence of this, so long as the latter is
broken up into small portions and distributed over the whole
surface, the currents are irregular aud undecided ; but as 800n
as these portions begin to be swept together and collected,
they assume a uniform direction, viz. towards that part where,
from contact of the vessel or other cause, they meet with no
counter currents ta oppose them. In what manner the crust
acts is however still a little obscure : in all probability it forms
a Voltaic combination with the mercury and the liquid.

48. In reasoning upon the facts detailed in this Paper, we
have to consider, as probably materially influencing the re-
sults, first, the vast difference of conducting power between the
metallic bodies set in motion, and the liquid under which they
are immersed. This is not unlikely to enter as one of the
essential conditions of the phenomenon, especially as it ap-
pears to result from all the experiments, that the peculiar
action, whatever it be, by which the currents are produced,
is exerted only at the common surface of the fluids. I have
never been able to produce the least trace of such currents
without the presence of a fluid metal. This leads us to con-
clude that a second essential condition is a perfect immiscibi=
