12 DR. FARADAY'S EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY. (SERIES XV.)

fluid or energy, in the nerves belonging to the electric organ at least, is electricityÂ®.
MM. PrevosT and Dumas are of opinion that electricity moves in the nerves be-
longing to the muscles ; and M. PrevosT adduces a beautiful experiment, in which
steel was magnetized, in proof of this view ; which, if it should be confirmed by further
observation and by other philosophers, is of the utmost consequence to the progress
of this high branch of knowledge. Now though I am not as yet convinced by the
facts that the nervous fluid is only electricity, still I think that the agent in the ner-
vous system may be an inorganic force; and if there be reasons for supposing that
magnetism is a higher relation of force than electricity (1664. 1731. 1734.), $0 it
may well be imagined, that the nervous power may be of a $till more exalted cha-
racter, and yet within the reach of experiment.

1792. The kind of experiment I am bold enough to suggest is as follows. If a
Gymnotus or Torpedo has been fatigued by frequent exertion of the electric organs,
would the sending of currents of similar force to those he emits, or of other degrees
of force, either continuously or intermittingly in the same direction as those he sends
forth, restore him his powers and strength more rapidly than if he were left to his na-
tural repose ?
