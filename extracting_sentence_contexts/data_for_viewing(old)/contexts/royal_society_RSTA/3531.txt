The method described in this paper is conservative by design, and the resulting uncertainty
bands may be dishearteningly large (figure 3). Conventional methods will usually provide
estimates with tighter bounds, and their use may well be justified if the underlying distribution
FX(x) is well behaved. However, the robust posterior distribution (and BIS implementation) can
still be used for comparison purposes. Significant differences in results will highlight the impact
of explicit and implicit assumptions made in the analysis, pointing out the need to confirm their
validity in a particular application.

Multivariate applications. A natural extension of this work is to consider the case of multivariate
samples. In its full generality, this is far from trivial, because a number of convenient properties
that accompany working on the real line no longer apply. In particular, the total ordering of real
numbers, the convenient cumulative form of the Dirichlet process and the fact that upper and
lower bounds of p-boxes are each valid cumulative distribution functions.

The definition and properties of multivariate p-boxes are a topic of ongoing research [13].
A general account of the bivariate case has recently been given by Pelessoni et al. [14]. Retracing
the construction of the robust posterior distribution F? for the bivariate case will require
addressing a number of challenges: (i) defining a random posterior p-box along the lines of (5.3)
and theorem 5.2; (ii) maximizing the learning rate (minimizing the impact of the prior), while
ensuring that the p-box is compatible with continuous distributions (see theorem 5.5 for the one-
dimensional case); (iii) defining a practical numerical procedure for sampling from the posterior
distribution and determining the impact on quantities of interest.

However, results of Troffaes & Destercke [13] suggest that the extension to multivariate spaces
