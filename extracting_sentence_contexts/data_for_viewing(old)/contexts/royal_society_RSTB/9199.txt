about empirical treatment require knowledge of the likely
pathogen(s) and the likely susceptibility of these pathogens
to antibiotics. Such knowledge is gained in part by clinical
experience over time, but more objectively and robustly
through surveillance. The US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) have defined surveillance as ‘The on-
going systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of
health data essential to the planning, implementation and
evaluation of public health practice, closely integrated with
the timely dissemination of these data to those who need to
know’ [4, p. 164]. Put more succinctly, surveillance is the gener-
ation and timely provision of information to inform decision-
making and action. Implicit in these definitions is the fact that
undertaking surveillance requires a readily available source of
data. For surveillance of antibiotic resistance, the essential core
data are generated by microbiology laboratories that routinely
identify and determine the susceptibility or resistance of bacteria
isolated from clinical specimens. These results are stored in the
laboratory computer system and if accessed, collected and ana-
lysed, can inform as to the degree of antibiotic resistance seen in
different bacterial species or isolates from different types of
infection. Changes or variation in antibiotic resistance either
geographically or over time can also be monitored. The remain-
der of this article will focus primarily on examples of
surveillance activities undertaken in the UK, and in particular
