Next, we have the structure of the tubes themselves, They are of chitin, and are
of considerable length. The chitin grows thin and membranous towards the end,
affording a good opportunity for the interchange of gases. Then there is the fact that the tubes are full of air. I satisfied myself on this
point by killing the living animal by a drop of chloroform, immediately cutting out
the organ, and teasing out the tubes in a drop of glycerine. When the tubes so
treated are placed beneath the microscope they have the peculiar shining appearance
which tracheal tubes usually have when placed in fluid beneath the microscope.
