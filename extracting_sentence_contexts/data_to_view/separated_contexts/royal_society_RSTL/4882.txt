I have
found that it is almost impossible to remove this envelope from the Frog's egg at
the moment of deposition, or even during the first few minutes after submersion,
and before it has become expanded by imbibition of fluid ; although it may be removed
without much difficulty from the egg of the Newt, the yelk of which, in the vitelline
membrane, lies free and unattached in its interior. But some time after the expan-
sion has taken plac2 I have myself found that the frog's egg may be deprived of
a large portion of this covering, and yet produce an embryo equally well as if it
had remained protected. On the other hand, one most important function of this
investment seems to be indicated in the following facts. SPALLaNzani found that
ova of-the Frog deprived of their envelopes before contact with the male influence,
were not impregnated ; and further, that ova taken directly from the ovaria, are not
susceptible of impregnation. A remarkable fact which I noticed, at a time when I was not fully aware of its
interest and importance, enables me to confirm this observation.
