§ 1. The Experiments of BecquereL and Mincuin, The Phenomena Observed by
Becqueren and Mrincutn are not Surface Phenomena, but their Combinations
form Inconstant Galvanic Cells under the Action of Inght. Polarisation.

Becqueret was the first to show that when two metallic plates are immersed in a
liquid, and one is exposed to light while the other is kept in the dark, an E.M.F. is
created.

Which now is the nature of this E.M.F.? Brcqurret’s and Mincuin’s (more
especially the latter's) experiments brought to our knowledge peculiar facts, which
all seemed to indicate that the above phenomena are surface phenomena, and strongly
to oppose the author's conception of such systems as galvanic cells. What were now
these observations of BecqueREL and Mincuin? According to BrcquerEeL: “ by
depositing on one of the Ag plates a thin layer of iodide, obtained by the action of
the vapour of iodine at the ordinary temperature and then exposing this plate to
light, it was found that it took positive electricity from the liquid. With a thick
layer of iodine on the surface of the Ag, there is on the contrary a current the
inverse of the proceeding, ¢.c., the plate exposed to light*took negative electricity ” ;
further, “ whilst with precipitated chloride and bromide of silver placed on plates of
platinum there is always produced a current of the same sense, the exposed plate
being positive ; with a layer deposited on Ag there is an effect depending upon the
thickness of this layer.” ‘These two inverse facts indicate that there should
