Measurements of the Expansion required to produce Cloud-like
Condensation. The transition from rain-like to cloud-like condensation is sudden enough to
enable one to measure, with considerable accuracy, the value of the ratio v,/v, when
cloud-like condensation just begins. There is, in fact, a second condensation point,
below which the drops are few, and the number shows only a slight increase with
increasing expansion ; while above it the number increases at an excessively rapid
rate with increasing expansion. Expansion required for Cloud-like Condensation in Saturated Air,
