The experiments of FarrparrN,f on the other hand, were restricted to tubes of
such relatively small length that he failed to realize the existence of a definite
minimum below which the strength of a tube, however long, will not fall. He also
neglected the possibility of discontinuities in the curve of collapsing pressure at points
where there is a change in the form of the distorted cross-section. In the light of
these facts, figs. 3 and 4 help to explain his well-known formula, by which the
collapsing pressure is given as inversely proportional to the length of the flue; for a
curve of hyperbolic form will represent as well as any other single curve the scattered
points of fig. 4, and trial shows that the hyperbola

is very closely an envelope of the discontinuous curve CBAE in fig.
