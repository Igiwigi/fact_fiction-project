We deposited some of the metal
electrolytically, and Mr. J. Crowrner fused the deposit into poles on a block of
willow charcoal, which contains only a very small amount of ash, but we must admit
the possibility of some traces of calcium having been taken up by the silver in the
process. The silver so prepared gave not only the H and K lines, but also the line at 4226,
with undiminished vigour. We do not offer any explanation as to the possible
sources of calcium, either in the metal or in the dust of the air, but the fact is
rendered remarkable by the appearance of the lines in question when the spectrum is
taken on the rotating wheel, Fig. 27 is a photograph taken on the stationary film
without self-induction, and the H and K lines are seen strongest near the centre of
the spark, With self-induction, the strongest lines of the spectrum are those of
calcium. In fig.
