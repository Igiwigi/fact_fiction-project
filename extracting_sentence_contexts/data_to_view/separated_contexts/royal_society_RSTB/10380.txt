Pair similarity was
slightly higher than shuffled pair similarity (figure 2e) but
not for the subset of shuffled pairs that appeared as across-
pair transitions (e.g. DA; electronic supplementary material,
figure S1). The checkerboard structure in DG and CA3 reflects the
fact that both AB and DA occurred in the sequence, but
never AC. That is, these regions are sensitive to which items
have co-occurred, but do not preferentially retrieve an
itemâ€™s most frequently co-occurring mate. DG memorizes
every exposed input pattern, and when given a cue like A
that is part of more than one pattern, activates units involved
in all conjunctive representations of exposed patterns that
included A (including AB but also the other exposed patterns
DA, FA, and HA).
