this quantity is independent of the nature of the radiating surface, and depends on the

= Dk medium only 80 far as regards the elasticity (p) of that medium, and not
Sdirectly on its temperature, but only 80 far as the elastic force is affected by that tem-
Eperature.

S These conclusions, as applicable to all radiating surfaces, were made to rest, as I have
already observed, on the somewhat narrow basis of induction from experiments on two
kinds of surface only, those of glass and silver. Moreover the complete numerical
Evalues of A and B depend upon that of the area of the radiating surface, which, as
Sremarked by MM. DvLoxe and PertiT, was not easy to determine for the bulbs of their
ZSthermometers; nor, in fact, was it their object to determine the numerical yalue of the
Squantity of heat denoted by Q, but to ascertain the 7aws according to which the cooling
Rof bodies takes place as depending on simple radiation into a vacuum, or on the contact

of a circumambient medium.

It should also be remarked that these experiments can only be regarded as establish-
ing the above formula for those cases in which the surrounding elastic medium is placed
under the same conditions as in the apparatus with which the experiments were made.
In another instrument these conditions might be different (as they are in that which I
am about to describe), and the quantity of heat carried from the heated surface by con-
vection might be different, while that due to radiation in yacuum must be the same. In
other words, the relation between A and B might be different for different instruments.
