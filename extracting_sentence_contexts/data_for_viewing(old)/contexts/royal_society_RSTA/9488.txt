In Table XTX. ¢,, ¢., ¢; and c, all rise to a maximum in 1893, and the general.
parallelism with the sunspot variation is readily seen, especially in ¢, and ¢ Table
XX. shows a similar state of matters, except that the value of ¢, in 1898 fell short of
that in several adjacent years,

The variation in the phase angle is by no means so decisive. In Table XTX. the
largest values of a, and a, are associated with the years of sunspot minimum, but the
smallest values occur in 1897, an intermediate year as regards sunspots. Accident
seems to play a sensible part in the relation between phase angles in successive years,
especially in the case of a; and «, The same remark applies in even greater measure
to Table XX.

Tn fact the influence of sunspot frequency on the phase is so small that for its study
it is desirable to combine the years in groups representative respectively of large and
small sunspot frequency, in hopes of eliminating accidental features. ;

§20. Tables XXI. and XXII. show the variation in amplitude and phase angle
throughout the year in the Fourier waves representing the diurnal inequality in H, and
Tables XXIII. and XXTV. do the same for V. Results are given for the whole 11 years,
also for 1890, 1899 and 1900 representing few sunspots, and 1892 to 1895 representing
many sunspots. Arithmetic means from the 12 months are given in Tables XXI. and
XXIII. When there is considerable variation of phase throughout the year, contribu-
tions from different months to the seasonal and yearly diurnal inequalities to some
extent neutralise one another. Thus frequently a better idea of the average activity
of the forces to which any particular Fourier wave is due is derivable from the
