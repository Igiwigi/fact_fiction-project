If we conceive this
ring, oval, or curye, projected on any plane, it is clear that the colours as depicted
on that plane will have more or less concentration, according as the element of the
arc corresponding to each is more or less inclined to the plane, and that where that
inclination is perpendicular, the intensity at the point of projection will be (mathe-
matically speaking) infinite in comparison with that of any other portion of the spec-
trum. 58. If we conceive the eye to be situated in the plane of our fictitious ring, its pro-
jection will be rectilinear, and we sball have a spectrum, as it were, doubled back on
itself at any particular part of its length, and the density of the rays where this redu-
plication takes place will be vastly greater than at any other point. By placing
the lens, therefore, s0 that this condition shall hold good, (which happens when its axis
lies in the plane of refraction of the prism, and the spectrum falls on its principal
s8ection,) the photographic impression will exhibit in its highest intensity the effect of
that particular chemical ray which is thus violently concentrated. Its illuminating
power, if any, will thus also be brought into corresponding evidence.
