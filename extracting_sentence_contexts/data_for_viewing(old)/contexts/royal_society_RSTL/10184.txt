however, beautifully preserved, and in them the cilia which line the general surface
of the stomodzeum may be easily seen. In most Alcyonaria which have been pre-
8erved in spirit these cilia are not easy to observe.

Tn the genus Briareus a very definite siphonoglyphe is present with long aad delicate
cilia.

In 7ubipora the siphonoglyphe is well marked, and provided with a dense armature
of long and strong cilia,

T was fortunate enough to obtain a fine specimen of the rare Celogorgia pulmosd
from Zanzibar. This genus, which resembles many of the Gorgonian Aleyonarians in
the complex branching of its axis, and in the fact that the polyps are not completely
retractile, differs from them in that there is no axial skeleton, but a single large canal
runs along the axes of the colony and its branches. In transverse section the cavity of
the stomodaum presents the appearance of a short T, the cross portion of the T being
the siphonoglyphe (Plate 50, fig. 3). The siphonoglyphe is beset with cilia, which,
though very much longer than those of the rest of the stomodzeum, are shorter and
more delicate, comparatively speaking, than those found on the siphonoglyphe of other
forms.

Passing on now to those forms which exhibit the phenomenon of dimorphism.

In the genus Sarcophyton, the dimorphism of which was first pointed out by
KomreR (9), and subsequently confirmed by MosELEey (14), the autozooids possess a
