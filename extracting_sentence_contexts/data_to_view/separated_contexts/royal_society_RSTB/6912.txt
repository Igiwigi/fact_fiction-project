Above the level of figure 22 it will be seen (figure 23) that a solenostelic
vascular system is present, this being the stele of the axillary bud. Figure 24, near the
bud apex, shows the first leaf of the bud. Mention may also be made of the fact that in other experiments in which a leaf pri-
mordium was isolated on the same panel of tissue as the apical meristem, the subsequent
development of the leaf was very limited and compared closely with those described above. By contrast, the leaves which developed in the isolated terminal region and in lateral buds
were of relatively large size. 5.
