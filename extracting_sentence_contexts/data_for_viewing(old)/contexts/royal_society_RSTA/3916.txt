EDS and the identification of wollastonite in the Raman spectrum were helpful in the assignment
of the mineral nature of the pigment, which is also in accordance with the fact that the polychromy
was manufactured in 1583. Lapis lazuli was a very expensive pigment obtained from lazurite, a
mineral whose best ores could be found in Afghanistan [19]. Early-modern Spanish art treatises
warned about the scarceness of this rich pigment, whereas commercial documents evidenced


that its trading started diminishing since the fifteenth century within the European milieu [28]. | 10 |
Francisco Pacheco would say that the lapis lazuli ‘was neither used in Spain, nor did the painters

have enough to use’, although there are some testimonies of trading practices through the city of “3
Venice [29]. In our sample, the possibility of an Afghan origin of the ultramarine blue is remote, 78
owing to these facts, and makes us consider that it could have a native origin. In fact, by the <
beginning of the eighteenth century, some lapis lazuli ores were registered in the Chilean Andes : Zs

[30] and in the middle of the nineteenth century a lapis lazuli deposit was discovered in Chile
[31]. Therefore, it should be no surprise that the painter used Andean lapis lazuli, as he also used
other native pigments, such as the green atacamite in the Virgin’s veil [3].

It should be stressed that this is the first time that lapis lazuli has been scientifically identified
in a Spanish American colonial painted layer.
