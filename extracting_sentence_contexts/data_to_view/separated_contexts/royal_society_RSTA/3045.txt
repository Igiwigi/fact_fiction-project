L. N. G. FILON ON THE To simplify the calculation, we may suppose that in the initial state of things
Q = 0, so that « = 0,4 = py. As a matter of fact Q cannot be 0, but the assumption
that x = 0, » = py is good enough to give the characteristics of the phenomenon
sufficiently well for our purpose. We have then

dp[AV = ApafAT + (AQUAT) {1 —(Ay/d)?} /2pal {1 —(dy/d)?}2+ 02/2,

In all the above d/dT denotes rate of divergence with regard to T of a quantity
for the two oppositely polarized rays.
