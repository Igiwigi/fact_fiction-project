The explicit presentation for the function C(t, X), when at the fracture’s inlet the concentration
of the radioactive solute reduces exponentially, ie. Co(t) =e~“4t, can be obtained by analogy with
the derivation of the formula (3.35). It can be readily shown that

C(t, X) = 0.5e%/2X0e)—At [eo -1/Xo) erfc (“= -V(a-1 a)

Using (3.32) and (3.34), and accounting for the fact that y <1, it can be easily shown that in
(3.37) the value of —1>0.

Numerical experiments were carried out for the following input parameters: A =0.1,Pe=
10,y =0.5uy =0.9, ut =10t = 20. Plots in figures 5 and 6 represent the results of comparison
of computations by exact formula (3.8) and by approximate expression (3.35).
