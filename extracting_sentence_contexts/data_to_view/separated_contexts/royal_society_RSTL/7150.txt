Amylic oxalate. Amyl, Amylic caproate,

The source of the amyl in this reaction is not difficult to discover; for, as above stated,
torrents of the usual products of its transformation (amylic hydride and amylene) were
Fyolved during the operation ; in fact it was obvious that no inconsiderable portions of
he zine and amylic iodide were occupied in the formation of zincic iodide and amyl, a
Zonsiderable proportion of the latter being as usual transformed at the moment of sepa-
Zation into aaylic hydride and amylene. = 2Ay I+2n"=Zn"l,+Ay,. =) Meeting with this.reaction, as we have done, only at the close of the above investiga-
Yon, we have not been able to ascertain whether or not it is one of general occurrence.
