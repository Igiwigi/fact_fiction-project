(b) Theca folliculi, which in the larger follicles was subdivided into theca interna and
theca externa.

The results obtained by this method are seen in table 5. The small primary follicles
which were chosen for detailed study had walls three or four cells in thickness and an
approximate diameter of 804. They showed only slow growth, and numbers of them were
constantly becoming atretic. There were only slight differences between the mitotic
activities of the various zones, but even allowing for the large standard deviations, a
general tendency was apparent for the greatest number of cell divisions to be situated near
the primary oocyte and the smallest number in the theca folliculi. When it is further remem-
bered that the oocyte zone presented the smallest area, the conclusion that a gradient did
in fact exist appears justified.
