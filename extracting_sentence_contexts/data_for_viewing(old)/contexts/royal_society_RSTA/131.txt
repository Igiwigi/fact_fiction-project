The study of non-canonical flows has offered additional insight into canonical
flows. For example, every bit of understanding of the polymer drag reduction
problem adds to the understanding of the canonical boundary layer itself; insight
into the effects of acceleration, rotation, free-stream turbulence and other such
auxiliary effects will also add to our understanding of canonical flows, but there is
no doubt that the canonical flows will continue to be of interest in their own
right. This has rightly been the subject of our attention here. This journal issue
has drawn together a picture of current research. While it offers neither an
exhaustive review nor detailed descriptions, we hope that recent progress and the
potential for future work have been highlighted to the reader.

The issue of scale separation, if such in fact exists in wall-bounded flows, is at
the heart of all scaling theories, and this likelihood increases with increasing
Reynolds numbers. New experimental facilities have permitted the study of ever
higher Reynolds numbers, and yet the measurement accuracy prevents us from
distinguishing between opposing hypotheses concerning even the mean-velocity
scaling. The greater urgency seems to be the ability to resolve all the scales, and
not simply move towards ever increasing Reynolds numbers. Recent massive
computations have augmented insight into the dynamics of the near-wall region,
and now approach Reynolds numbers where the overlap layer may be
simulatedâ€”but there is a long way to go before they approach experiments.
The academic challenges have thus remained, even as practical needs for better
understanding have mounted. This is the dichotomy of the field.
