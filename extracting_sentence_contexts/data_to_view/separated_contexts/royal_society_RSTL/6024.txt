Fig. 2. Represents a portion of a compound fibre from the tongue of the frog. The
branch from this (not more than z7;7th of an inch in diameter) is seen to
contain three or four separate fibres; and it will be obseryed that, as this
nerve passes to the larger trunk. fibres proceed from it which pass in both
directions,â€”a fact which 1 have repeatedly observed in all the animals I have
examined. Fig. 3, Small portion of a fine nerve-fibre from the frog's tongue dividing into several
Separate branches. The subdivisions of the oval bodies are well seen.
