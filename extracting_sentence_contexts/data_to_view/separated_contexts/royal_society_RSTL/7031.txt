Wherefore. I put it
into a gallypot ; and the experiments, which T made
with this ſame poiſon a good while afterward, con-
vinced me, that there is no reaſon to apprehend, that
it would loſe any of its activity by evaporation. Theſe two facts plainly ſhew, how much precau-
tion ought to be taken, when-this poiſon is to be
uſed. And we ſhall be the better convinced of it,
when we conſider, that one ſingle drop, conveyed
directly into the blood by a puncture, &c. is ſome-
times ſufficient to kill, or at leaſt to cauſe great diſ-
turbance in the animal economy. It is quite other-
wiſe, when taken in at the mouth; for then it
does no ſort of miſchief, as I ſhall prove in another

lace,
: Let us now paſs to the experiments, which I have
repeated a number of times on different ſpecies of
quadrupeds, birds, fiſhes, inſets, and reptiles.
