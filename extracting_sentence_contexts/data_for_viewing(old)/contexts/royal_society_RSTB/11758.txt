different categories of discrimination. However, previous
studies of the dual-task paradigm provide evidence that
top-down attention is an undifferentiated resource
[22,74,75]. For instance, Lee et al. [22] employed experiments
to compare the concurrent discrimination of form, colour
and motion. Interference was indistinguishable for similar
(e.g. central letter task versus peripheral letter task) and
dissimilar (e.g. central letter task versus peripheral motion
task) task combinations, which highlights that different visual
discriminations likely exhaust the same attentional capacity.

However, it is not clear if the same logic can be applied to
subjective ratings and metacognition (type 2 AUC). In fact,
we identified two outlier subjects (figure 4) who clearly vio-
late the assumptions of dual-task studies. These two subjects
did not distinguish correct and incorrect trials in terms of
PAS in the single task but did so in the dual task. There
can be several possible reasons for this behaviour.

One possibility is that the instructions for rating perceptual
awareness were unclear. Because we did not include examples
of invisible and visible stimuli, it is possible that subjects were
not sure when to assign PAS of 1 and 4. Another possibility is
that these outlier subjects used PAS ‘across’ the single- and
