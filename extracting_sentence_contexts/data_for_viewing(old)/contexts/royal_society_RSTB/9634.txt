require positive evidence of the absence of the gene in the
other lineages (such as the identification of orthologous but
non-coding sequence), thus permitting inference of absence
in the ancestral sequence [26,42]. Ideally, these studies should
include transcriptome data analysis to accompany DNA
sequence analysis to minimize the under-discovery of genes.

It is possible that some of the more conservative search
criteria introduce bias into the results. For example, the predic-
