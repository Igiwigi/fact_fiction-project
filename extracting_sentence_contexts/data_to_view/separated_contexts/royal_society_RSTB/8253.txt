They avoid—probably through their OM pore, Intimin, Invasin and their
deliberately—a clear discussion on the topology and homologues seem to follow the same export route as
connectivity between the extracellular domains and classical autotransporters. Intimin has a long Sec
the anchor, albeit suggesting that they are autotrans- signal peptide [109] and thus is translocated by the
porters [108-111]. Even the fact that Intimin can be Sec machinery into the periplasm, as is Invasin. The
used for surface display of heterologous proteins [108] passenger domain of Intimin is kept in a trans-
