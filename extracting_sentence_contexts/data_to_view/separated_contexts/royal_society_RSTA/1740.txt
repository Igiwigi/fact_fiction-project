A particular challenge is that in many countries, fusion is regulated by the same
entity that fission is regulated. While both are assuredly nuclear technologies, there are many
important differences. In fact, you could make a convincing argument that fusion is in fact the
opposite of fission, and should be regulated as such. Fission regulations reflect an understanding
that nuclear chain reactions can get out of control, exposing the public to dangerous radiation. With a fusion power plant designed with safety in mind, no such danger exists.
