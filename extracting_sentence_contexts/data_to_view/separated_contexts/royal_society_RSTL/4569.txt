A good theory is more than a femporary expression of the state of
science, collecting under a general view the facts acquired up to the moment of its
birth. It will not, like ephemeral hypothesis, vanish before the light of succeeding
discoveries, but expanding with the growth of science, it will still correctly represent
the known facts, though of necessity modified into a more general expression. Such a theory then was that of LigpiG, Resting as it did, upon the facts observed
in the formation of the neutral amides, it was, as originally framed, an expression of
the knowledge we then possessed. Subsequent researches showed that it was not,
only the 1 equiv. of hydrogen (the abstraction and replacement of which had led us
to amidogen and the amides) that could be removed from the ammonia, but that
Similarly 2 equivs., and even the whole of the hydrogen could be withdrawn from
their position in this base and substituted by other atoms, as in the imides and
nitriles.
