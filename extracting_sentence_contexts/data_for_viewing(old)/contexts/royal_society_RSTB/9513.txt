the motor that drives adversarial truth-seeking. The parties
have both the presumptive knowledge and the strongest
motivation to present their own best cases to the fact-finder,
and to interrogate their adversarial opponent’s arguments
and supporting evidence through vigorous cross-examination.
Adversarialism is an incomparably efficient way of narrowing
down the issues and getting to the heart of factual disputes
[51,55]. Criminal procedure regulates not only the generation
and presentation of evidence, but also its testing and evalu-

proposition, that evidence that has withstood concerted foren-
sic examination offers securer epistemic warrant for judicial
fact-finding and jury verdicts than evidence that has never
been tested in the forensic crucible.

This is not to deny that adversarialism is capable of generat-

To the contrary, there is ample experience and some research
evidence to confirm the common sense prediction, that police,
prosecutors and defence lawyers have been known to present
false evidence or conceal relevant information [56-58].
More routinely, trial advocates attempt to ‘spin’ their cases to
their own strategic advantage. Elements of these behaviours
shade off into outright criminality—perverting the course of
justice—or, at the least, involve blatant contravention of insti-
