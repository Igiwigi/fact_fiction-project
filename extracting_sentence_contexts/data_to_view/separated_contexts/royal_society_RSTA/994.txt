Finally, at 62%, there is
also a jamming transition but at a lower shear rate. If we increase the volume fraction still further,
at some given value close to 66% the system is completely jammed and there is no flow at all
when the stress is increased. In fact, the complete blockage of the system whatever the imposed
stress will depend a lot on the plasticity of the particles, the roughness of the walls of the cell and
the non-dilatancy of the gap under large applied shear stress. The DST transition can be more or less abrupt. For instance, in figure 2 we have reported the
jamming transition for carbonyl iron particles (average diameter 1.2 1m), for calcium carbonate
particles (average diameter 41m) and for silica particles (average diameter 51m).
