CLARKE ON THE INTIMATE STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN.

mass several bundles of fibres with intervening layers of grey substance ascend long
dinally through the grey network with which they constitute the outer nucleus of
auditory nerve (C 0, fig. 23.). The inner nucleus. (5, fig. 29) of the auditory
although marked off from 9 by the dotted line to indicate its limits, is really di
continuous with it; neither can any alteration of structure be discovered, as the.
passes into the other. ; N

(13) I have been thus exact and particular in following out the gradual transi
and morphological changes which take place in ascending the medulla, not only
account of their extreme importance directly and indirectly in both a pathological
physiological point of view, but also on account of the necessity of understanding
the structure, connexions, and relations of the various elements of this part of
medulla, in order to interpret correctly the morphological and histological relations
the parts which are situated higher up. And indeed I believe that these changes whi
I have thus described, and which have cost me no small amount of thonght and la
to follow out and confirm, will be the means of correcting many errors, and of leadi
to a more exact knowledge of other parts of the brain.

(14) But before I proceed to these parts it will be necessary to describe some new
and important facts which I have recently ascertained with regard to the structure of
the medulla oblongata. In my former memoir on this subject, I gave the following composition of the anterior
pyramids, according to my observations at the time :—

1. Decussating fibres of the anterior commissure, continuous with that of the spinal
cord.
