retained life for three or four days after remoyal from the fish, until signs appeared of
incipient putrefaction.

It is true that Sir Everarp Hows, in the fifth volume of his Lectures on Compara-
tive Anatomy, has denied that spermatic animalcules essentially belong to the prolific
fluid, and was of opinion that they are a mere fiction of the mind, because neither he
nor Mr. Baves could detect them. His opinion at the present time, I apprehend, can
have no weight, and it will be received only as a proof of the imperfection and fee-
bleness of the instrument which he used, and serve as a warning, much as it is to be
regretted, that no reliance is to be placed on his microscopical observations.

The testes of the Torpedo are distinguished from those of the Thornback and com-
mon Ray, by wanting that milt-like margin or appendage described by Baron Cuvigs.
Should it be found wanting in all the viviparous species of cartilaginous fishes, its
presence in the oviparous may be considered as a link between them and the os8eous
oviparous fishes furnished with milts*. Perhaps in the milt-like part of the testes of
the Ray and Thornback, the ova of the spermatic animalcules are developed; and,
perhaps, in the globular portion they grow and are matured. The microscopical
