The smaller proportion of up-wind courses among higher fliers was not merely due to the
wind speed increasing from the ground upwards, making it more difficult for insects farther
from the ground to make progress against the wind. What happened in winds of 4 to 7 m./sec.,
against which progress definitely was difficult, can be seen in the third lower diagram in
figure 11; a preference for down-wind courses (as against across-wind ones) was added to
the preference for up-wind courses. But in winds of less than 4 m./sec., there was no down-
wind preference among higher fliers, which nevertheless showed a weaker up-wind pre-
ference than did lower fliers. This was evident even when the wind speed near the ground
was less than 1 m./sec. and the ground was free of obstructions. The wind 8 m. above such
ground could hardly reach 4 m./sec. when it was less than 1 m./sec. near the ground.

The fact that the data for winds of 4 to 7 m./sec. in figure 11 show a more clearly defined
orientation preference among higher fliers than among lower ones does not mean that the
lower fliers were less responsive. When watched continuously the lower fliers always seemed
to be more responsive, but in these strong and gusty winds their responses were variable and
did not result in steady flying in any one direction.

If responsiveness did decrease with height but increased with wind speed, as required by
the hypothesis, what of the responses themselves? The collected records in figure 11 and the
continuous observations figure 11 fairly reflects, show the up-wind preference in more
moderate winds and down-wind preference among higher fliers in stronger wind, which are
expected on the hypothesis. No down-wind preference is shown among the records for lower
fliers in stronger winds, but the postulated tendency to turn down-wind was observed, and
the general instability of behaviour under these height-wind conditions also accords with
