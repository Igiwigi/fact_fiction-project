Dr. Power, examined its chemical composition, and informs
me, that it decidedly consists of the triple phosphat of ammo-
nia and magnesia, with phosphat of lime, forming together
| the fusible calculus of Dr. WoLLasroxN (Phil. Trans. 1797.)
mixed with a certain portion of animal matter, which was se-
parated and floated under a membrane-like form, on the

5 solution of the salts in diluted acids. That this composition is
S demonstrable by all the usual relations to alkalies and diluted
jE acids, and the precipitates from solutions in the latter, by am-
- monia, and also by its fusion into enamel under the blow-pipe,
£ and that the general external character of the calculus estab-
Z lishes the same fact by its semi-transparent appearance, and
Y regular prismatic crystals of the triple salt, discoverable by a
Z magnifier, between the more compact layers.

Z The nuclei were examined solely with the blow-pipe, from
> a wish not to disturb so fine a specimen beyond what had been
E done by the operation. By this examination they were found
E, less fusible than the general mass, and appeared to contain a
ES larger proportion of phosphat of lime, for by admixture of a
= portion of triple phosphat of magnesia, taken from another
- part of the same calculus, they were rendered as fusible as
£ the rest.
