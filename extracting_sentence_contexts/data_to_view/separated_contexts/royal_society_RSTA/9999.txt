If E = 2, AM y-2,41 = k. a, and therefore if «,"" +0, the « roots of this equation
1
are all different. If, however, ty 2, Ay-s,4+1 again is identically zero, and the
1

necessary equations of condition are again satisfied. Proceeding thus we find, in fact, that if a,’ 4 0, Oyp, ...) Pip-njq+23 8 = 1... all
vanish and that 6%)~.,41 is the root of a binomial equation of degree «, whose roots
are all different, and so for the other divisors of k. If, however, ,'* = 0 we have the
same equations of condition again necessary, viz., «,"" and a,"%" = 0, &e. Assuming, then, that «,'* 4 0, we find, without difficulty, that all the quantities
6,8 vanish for s = 1...¢, save those for which 7 is of the form —k(p—m/e)+1, so that
the exponential arising in the first « rows involves only ¢’" and not ¢.
