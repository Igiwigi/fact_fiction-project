ties of the sensory input itself must be taken into account.
How prominent a pulse is within the physical input has
been estimated, for example, using methods based on con-
trast [4,79,82,84], frequency-tagging [77,81,83,85,86] or
autocorrelation [72,87]. Investigating the sensitivity of the
perceptual system to the periodicity of various input features
has contributed to understanding the mapping from rhyth-
mic input to internal meter [4,74,88,89], and has led to the
development of extensive models of pulse and meter percep-
tion [46,88,90,91]. However, it is important to note that the
aims of analysing pulse prominence in the physical input
also go beyond providing a comprehensive model of percep-
tual experience. In fact, analysing the physical stimulus is
critical to capture the relevant transformation underlying
the mapping from rhythmic input to internal meter. The
term ‘transformation’ is thus used here to emphasize the
range of neural processes from the peripheral receptors to
cortical pathways, which are involved in the mapping from
physical input to meter by gradually transforming the
internal representation from faithful tracking of input phys-
ical features towards higher-level behaviourally relevant
categories (metric pulse(s) in our case) [29,92-94].
