1t will be noticed that even the smallest oocytes of the 3 weeks chick are considerably
larger than the largest of the 4 days chick. I consider that this period of growth of
all the oocytes intervening between these stages is the extra-follicular growth period
of D’Hotianpver. All the oocytes present in the ovary at this time enter upon this
phase of development. It will be seen also that in the older ovaries the smallest oocytes
found do not vary much in size, although a slight but definite increase is to be observed
in the minimum size in successive stages. In fact the smallest oocytes of the laying
hen are only one-half as large again in diameter as the smallest in the 3 weeks chick.
It is obvious, therefore, that many of the oocytes remain throughout the development
of the fowl, and even for some time after sexual maturity, at almost the same size as
they had attained in the ovary of the 3 weeks old chick at the close of the extra-follicular
growth period. Others, however, appear to grow more rapidly, as is shown by the
maximum measurements for the 3, 6, and 11 weeks chicks. The difference between
the maximum size of the oocytes of the 3 and 6 weeks chicks is enormous, being more
than 500 per cent. ; however, the maximum size of the oocytes of the 6 and 11 weeks
chicks is the same. From this it is clear that many of the oocytes enter upon a period
of rapid growth between the third and sixth week after hatching. The cytological
evidence shows that, in the 6 weeks chick, all the oocytes over 75y in diameter exhibit
marked abnormalities and signs of atresia. In the 11 weeks chick all the oocytes over
