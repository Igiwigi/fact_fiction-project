changes in the internal capacity of the sacs can possibly occur, except in the direction
of the Jong axis of each through movements of its outer wall; and even if distension
ov contraction should take place in the latter direction, it is impossible that any
motion could be imparted to the tripodes, by reason of the atrophy of the dorsal walls
and the now-existence of the usual fibrous tracts by which such an effect is normally
brought about. The extremely diminutive size of the air-bladder, when compared
with the bull of the Fish, taken in conjunction with such facts in the structure of
the organ as those indicated above, force us to adopt the conclusion that the air-
Sbladder in Glyptosternum and Bagarius must be regarded as a vestigial and function-
“less structure—a conchision which veceiyes additional support from the existence
Sof similar retrogressive modifications in the Weberian mechanism, and in those
2purts of the internal ear that are specially related tu it.
” Ih our necessarily imperfect account of Akysis and Acrochordonichthys there were
Sseveral interesting points that we were unable to determine with certainty, of which
Sthe most important were, the condition of the dorsal walls of the ait-sacs, and the
Spresence or abserice of a sinus endolymphaticus. We cannot but think, however,
that our tentative conclusions with regard to those genera derive considerable support
from the resulis of our inyestigations of G/yptosternum and Bageaius, From the
