lived. Smoke could now be seen ascending in vast columns from the crater. Many
tried to escape to Georgetown, but when they got to Rabaka they found the Dry
River there pouring down in high flood, and the water was so hot it was impossible
to wade across. There is no bridge over this river, so most of these refugees, gathered

there was a distinct flash of lightning seen from the direction of the mountain, followed by a crackling
peal of thunder, At 10.45 I got a little uneasy, and just at the same moment I got a message from
