4. Protocol of determination for waviness angle

(a) Acquisition of contour map of ECT signal

The method proposed in this paper to evaluate the detectability of ECT probes for fibre waviness
is based on image processing. Therefore, to start the process, it is necessary to acquire a low-noise
two-dimensional contour map of ECT signal amplitude. After performing ECT scanning, two
kinds of ECT signal with different phases, V; and Vy, were obtained. These two signals have both
signals from fibre and others. The signal from fibre orientation has a larger amplitude, and the
phase is significantly shifted. Based on this fact, the ECT signal from the fibre is distinguished
from others by rotating the phases of Vx and Vy in the complex plane using a rotation matrix. In
the case of CirD (w = 90), a phase-rotated Vy signal was used for the evaluation protocol as shown
in figure 8.

After phase rotation, the spatial frequency spectrum of the contour map of the ECT signal
was analysed by applying spatial Fast Fourier Transform (2D-FFT). The resolution of spatial
frequency is about 20 m7? in both the x- and y-directions. Figure 9 exhibits a 2D-FFT spectrum and
single-sided FFT amplitude of V, of CirD (w =90). The single-sided FFT amplitudes in both the
x-and y-directions were concentrated below 1000 m~!. In addition, the signal in the x-direction at
frequencies from 0 to 40 m7! contained the bias information such as the gradient of the specimen.
Therefore, the contour map of Vy was processed with FFT band-pass filtering from 50 to 1000 m!
in the x-direction and with FFT low-pass filtering at 1000 mâ„¢! in the y-direction. The contour map
