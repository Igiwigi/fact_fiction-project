aggregation of the inert particles ceases as soon as they have reached the bottom of
the vessel.

But the resemblance is almost exactly parallel if (instead of allowing the Euglenze
to move upwards again), on placing the card on the upper surface, we at the same
time, or shortly afterwards, allow light to impinge vertically from below on the lower
surface. The attractive force of light will prevent the upward movement of the
Euglen and will keep them in a thin layer on the lower surface of the vessel. We
can still further emphasise the resemblance to the precipitate by now, in the dark or
a weak light, turning the vessel upside down, so that the film lies uppermost, when
the aggregation figure is at once again produced (Plate 33, fig. 18). These experiments
can be repeated any number of times, so long as the Euglenze remain motile. In
these experiments we might, in fact, regard the living Euglene as a precipitate
consisting of motile particles.

In the last experiment, if, instead of turning the vessel upside down, we simply
remove the light, the Euglenze will at once begin to move upwards, and almost at the
same time a delicate reticulation will be observed in the film. Examination under
a low power of the microscope shows that here also we have a slight movement
upwards and downwards, as in the ordinary aggregation, and it is no doubt
explainable in the same way. A somewhat similar effect is produced in a thin
layer of sediment if the vessel in which it is contained is gently tapped on its under
surface. A slight movement of the particles is set up and, as they settle down,
a reticulate pattern is produced. f
