pstrated a paralysing action on that structure, with an intensity varying with the
molecular weight of the aldoxime. There has also been observed an initial period of
z√©pinal irritability. This primary phase in the action of the lower three aldoximes has
Avaried inversely as the molecular weight, and not only does the duration of the phase
lessen with the increase of weight, but also its intensity.

It is in this primary action that cenanthaldoxime has been found to depart from the
general rule. Although cenanthaldoxime is certainly more toxic to the spinal centres
than either of the three lower homologues, yet in comparison with their action the
duration of the stimulant phase of cenanthaldoxime is found to bear a greater
Proportion to the duration of the whole action. And not only the duration, but also
the intensity of the phase is greater, as shown by reflex convulsive movements. In
fact, with cenanthaldoxime, this primary stimulant action on the spinal cord ceases to
