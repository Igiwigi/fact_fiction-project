HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES. 135

placenta as exemplified by that of Cebus (and the same holds true for that of Hapale)
cannot adequately be described as formed simply by a trabecular network; rather
is it a villous placenta in which the greatly branched and relatively slender villi are
not completely free but are connected to a variable and inconstant extent by direct
fusions and syncytial junctions. Over extensive areas of the villous field, however,
these latter connections break down and disappear with the result that the villous
branches become isolated from each other and lie free in a continuous intervillous
blood-space. Thus, in the end, the Platyrrhine placenta attains a condition which
is not so very different from that of the Catarrhine organ, a remarkable and highly
significant fact. And, here, we may direct attention to another very interesting parallel
between the Platyrrhine and Catarrhine placentas. In recent years, certain Catarrhine
placentas have been described which, in the presence of syncytial strands and plates
connecting the villi so strikingly recall the Platyrrhine condition that certain authorities
have regarded them as representing the transitional stage in the evolution of the
Catarrhine organ from a Platyrrhine-like type.
