break down, so that the group takes up another configuration of greater or less
stability, and the oscillations which necessarily ensue on the change result to our
senses in the production of heat. On this view hysteresis is a phenomenon that
prevents us, if we would take full account of the facts, from ignoring certain coordi-
nates we have hitherto ignored. We can, however, go on ignoring these coordinates
if we suppose 7 not to have a constant form in terms of the variables not ignored
above, but a form which depends on the particular state as to these groups of mole-
cules of an element of volume. We must, then, suppose certain variables—call them
hysteresis-coordinates—which define the relative numbers of groups of different kinds.
Of these 7 will be a function, but they are not of the nature of ordinary dynamical
coordinates. Their value merely determines the instantaneous form of J as a function of
ordinary coordinates, so that if one or more of the hysteresis-coordinates change, the
form of J changes and a new dynamical era begins. In fact, they are very analogous
to 0, and like @ they must not be varied when the dynamical coordinates are varied
in order to obtain the equations of motion. A mathematical development of Professor
Ew1ne’s theory may be supposed to furnish the nature of these variables, and experi-
ment must then be appealed to at once to test the theory, and if the test be favour-
able, to find the exact form of / in terms of the variables. And from the mathematical
development, or that combined with experiment, we must look to find the laws of
variation of the hysteresis coordinates when H and ¥ vary.

72. This, of course, is only to be looked upon as an ideal procedure of events,
which, perhaps, for many years cannot come about. Meanwhile, tentative hypotheses
as to the nature of these variables might be made. For instance, it might be
assumed that J is always correctly given by equation (1), § 59 above, and that the
