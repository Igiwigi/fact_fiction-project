Hence, we focus on
the point spectrum of the linearized operator. The associated eigenvalue problem determining
the point spectrum op; is obtained by substituting the ansatz U(x, t) = Up(x) + eM y(x), with
AEC \ ess with cess = (—00, —], into (2.1) and linearizing the resulting expression. This gives

—(u+a)p4 51(3) G/(Up)p =0. (29)

The spatial localization of the impurity and the fact that Up is to leading order constant in the
fast field I; allows us to treat (2.9) in a similar fashion as (2.2). In fact, in the slow regions IE the
impurity is exponentially small and the slow flow of (2.9) is approximated by

dx (2.10)

dq _
and aden (u + A)p. Hence, the leading order slow flow of (2.9) in the slow regions can be obtained from the leading
order slow flow of (2.3) by replacing with + a.
