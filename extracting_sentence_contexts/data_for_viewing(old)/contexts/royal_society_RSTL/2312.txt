will show us that it is regulated by evident design, and is one of those beautiful pro-
visions in the animal economy by which harmony in the functions of eyery part of
the body is preserved. The wings, the organs of the most varied and rapid motion,
endowed with an equal degree of sensibility and power, are required at eyery effort of
the insect to act in the most perfect unison, and hence must be supplied with their
energy from the same centre. That this is the reason for the union of these nerves,
is, I think, apparent, from the fact that in the Bee, the Ichneumon, and other hy-
menopterous insects remarkable for their velocity and power of flight, the nerves to
the wings originate almost precisely in the same manner as in the Sphinx and its
affinities; while in others, as in the Panorpa communts, L1NN., or Scorpion Fly, they
originate by double-rooted pairs, just as in the larva of the Sphinx ; and the insect is
neither remarkable for its velocity nor equability of motion. And it may be further
stated, that in winged coleopterous insects, in which the wing-covers are merely
elevated, and are motionless during flight, the wings alone being actively employed,
the nerves to the two organs are not always united, but often originate separately from
the great neryous centres, and are continued to their distribution as separate trunks,
like the nerves to the legs or the antennze.
