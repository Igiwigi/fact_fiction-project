severe. due to the industrial nature of the atmosphere.


FARADAY’S “STEEL AND ALLOYS.” 277

After this exposure, the rust was removed by gentle rubbing with a soap of
the type incorporating a hard powder, and the pieces were washed, dried and again
weighed.

The results are given in Table VI, which displays the interesting fact that both
platinum and rhodium additions to steel in the amounts to which they are present
appreciably retard corrosion. The improvement effected here is not, however,
sufficient to be of any practical value. That is, while it is possible that under ordinary
conditions the tarnishing or rusting of instruments or mirrors made from these alloys
might take somewhat longer than with carbon steels, Farapay had by no means fully
achieved with them his desired objective. Nevertheless, these results do suggest the
possibility that, with appreciably larger percentages of platinum or rhodium, alloys
having distinct claims to non-corrodibility might be obtained. It is, therefore, all
the more to be regretted that the present collection does not contain any examples
of the more highly alloyed steels made by Farapay, specially, too, when it is remembered
that it is only in the comparatively high percentages of 12 per cent. and over that
chromium steels acquire a usefully non-corrodible character. The author hopes shortly
