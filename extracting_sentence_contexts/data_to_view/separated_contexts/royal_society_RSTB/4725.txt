BURNE ON SOME PECULIARITIES OF THE

trunks of supply to the supra-hepatic rete ; he figures it as an unbranched vessel running
from the lateral cutaneous artery to the rete, and evidently did not observe its connection
with the lower lateral cutaneous artery. This is an important omission, and probably
led MULLER to the assumption that the flow of blood within this vessel is to the rete,
whereas it is almost certainly the other way, from the rete to the lower lateral cutaneous
artery. For what Mier takes to bea single vessel is in fact two—(1) a trunk connected
at one end with the supra-hepatic rete and the pericardial artery (fig. 15, /.lat.cut.r.)
and at the other directly continuous with the lower lateral cutaneous artery; and
(2) a branch (the anastomosis) (fig. 10, an.) from the lateral cutaneous artery which
enters this trunk almost at right angles. Are we then to consider the branch from the lateral cutaneous artery, or the trunk
from the rete, or both, to be the source of blood supply to the lower lateral cutaneous
artery ? Ifthe branch from the lateral cutaneous artery is the sole source of supply, blood
would flow along it not only to the lower lateral cutaneous artery, but (as MitieR
thought) to the supra-hepatic rete.
