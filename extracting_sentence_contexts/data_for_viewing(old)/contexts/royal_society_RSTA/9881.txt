to those of corresponding lines in the are spectrum.

If we dealt only with the are spectrum of the element in relation to the sun, the
selection of lines for representation in the Fraunhofer spectrum would certainly be
very remarkable. Of two lines in the same part of the spectrum one may be a
comparatively strong line in the sun, while the other, although at least equally strong
in the are, may be weak or missing. For example, the strong line 5672 only occurs
with intensity 0 in the sun, while 5684, which is much weaker in the are, appears
with intensity 1 in the sun.

These differences, however, become comprehensible when due attention is given to
the properties of the different lines. The lines of scandium which appear most
prominently among the Fraunhofer lines are, in fact, the enhanced lines, and within
the limits of error of estimation they appear with relative intensities which are
identical with those in the terrestrial spectrum. Lines other than those which are
enhanced, even though strong lines in the are, occur only as very faint lines in the
solar spectrum.

The coincidences between scandium and solar lines, within the limits of error, are
numerous, but many of them cannot reasonably be regarded as other than accidental.
Even a faint solar line may properly be attributed to scandium if coincident with an
enhanced line of corresponding intensity ; but if the scandium line be not an enhanced
one, the coincidence can only be accepted as significant when the solar line is faint
and the scandium line strong,
