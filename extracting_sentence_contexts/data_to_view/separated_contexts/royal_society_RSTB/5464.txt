That is the tentative conclusion at which
I had arrived with regard to the pleuropodium in Pieris. Its maximum development
coincides with the rupture of the embryonic membranes, its extensions can
certainly be traced across the amniotic cavity to the amnion, and it disappears on larval
emergence. All these facts support the conclusion of Dre Setys Lonccuamps. The
evidence is, however, only circumstantial, and certainly in Pieris might equally conform
to the opinions expressed by Korscnevr, 1912, and BuuncK, 1912, that it is an organ
which produces a fluid to enable the embryo the more easily to perform the flexures of
body effected during blastokinesis, for it has already been pointed out that the gland
is in process of development during blastokinesis. BAtLLon, 1920, seems to be the only
other worker who suggests a different function.
