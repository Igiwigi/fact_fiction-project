3 Received November 19,—Read December 15, 1892. GleRMANN (1) has investigated the electromotive properties of the skins of Fish. Flis object in so doing was to attempt to determine, by the employment for
periment of a skin usually credited with being bereft of glands, whether the
marked “ current of rest” exhibited by the skins of Amphibia is with greater proba-
ay to be ascribed to glandular processes in accordance with the opinion of pu Bots
‘Bnymonp (2), or whether the phenomena are not explained with greater simplicity
"Bpon the principles of his own ‘ Alterations-Theorie.’ Du Bots failed to obtain
Eibes of a “current of rest” in the four kinds of Fish with which he worked (Eel,
Sench, Pike, and Perch), a fact, which taken in conjunction with the absence of
"B glands,” satisfied him that in the richly glandular Amphibian skin the source of the
Eur. must lie in the secreting structures. Hermann himself, previous to his
@xamination of the skins of Fish, shared to some extent the opinion of pu Bors, for
“#1 a paper published in 1878 (3), he inclines to the idea, that preparatory processes
éf glandular origin are the cause of the E.M.F. of the current of rest in the skin of the
Frog, but also advances the supposition of a possible contribution from epithelial
‘Betion at the surface. Finally, as is well known, Hermann demonstrated the
resence of an ingoing current of rest in the skins of some ten genera of Fish, but
und that its E.M.F. was far less than that exhibited by the Amphibian skin.
