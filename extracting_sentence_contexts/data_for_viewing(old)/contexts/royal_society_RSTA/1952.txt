leads to small oscillations close to the walls due to its inherent stair-case approximation, the
parietal C, profile (0 < x/C < 1) is also in agreement with reference studies. All in all, considering
the relatively coarse grid mesh—as compared to [43] where C = 800 grid points were used for
the 343-shifted-velocity 5-constraints method—and the very simple no-slip boundary condition
used in this study, these results are very encouraging. Indeed, accounting for (1) the speedup
induced by the use of the D3Q39 lattice instead of the D3Q343, and (2) the fact that stable and
accurate results are obtained with C = 350 (instead of C = 800), the present approach decreases
the overall CPU time and memory consumption required to run this simulation by two orders
of magnitude as compared to the more standard approach [43]. Interestingly, it is done without
relying on shifted versions of the D3Q39 that would further shift its stability domain around the
predefined shifted velocity, as demonstrated by Hosseini et al. [89] and further investigated in
appendix C. It is eventually worth noting that stable simulations were obtained up to Re = 10° in
under-resolved conditions (C = 200 points). This confirms the excellent properties of our Knudsen
number based stabilization technique.

Hereafter, the 3D behaviour of our model is investigated in the low-Reynolds, supersonic regime.
