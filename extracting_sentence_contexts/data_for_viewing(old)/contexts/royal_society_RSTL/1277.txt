seclusion from the substance, in which it is imbeaded.

In some of the specimens in Mr. GrtirFiTas's possession,
the shell is just covered in, and that part close to the termi-
nation is extremely thin, but in others is increased in thickness
twenty fold: in others again the shell has not only become
thick, but the animal has receded from its first inclosure, and
has formed a second three inches up the tube, and afterwards
a third two inches further on, and has made the sides thicker
and thicker, to diminish the canal in proportion to. the dimi-
nution of its own size.

These facts prove that the teredo gigantea, when arrived
at its full growth, or whenever prevented from increasing its
length, closes up the end of its shell, and lives a long time
afterwards, furnished with food from the sea-water it receives
like the actinezz. The teredo navalis closes up its shell in the
same manner; it must, therefore, after that period, be sup-
plied with food entirely through the medium of sea-water.

The teredines in their anatomical structure are more perfect
than many of the other vermes, and have a portion of red
