Thus, the time which we have used
for Plymouth is 5* 33n, that being the time of high water at full and change, or
the vulgar establishment. But the high water at Plymouth corresponding to
the moon's syzygy is two days and a half after the change, at which time the tide
is only 5" 3" after the moon, this being the corrected establishment. This cause,
however, will not alter the form of the line; for it applies equally to the tide at
every point of the same line: the only consequence is, that the line which is
taken to belong to 5" 33", does in fact belong to 5 3, corrected establishment;
and the 5" 33" line, similarly corrected, would be a little in advance of the
position we have assigned ; and each of the other lines will in like manner
require to. be thrown forwards by a small quantity proportional to. the age of

the tide, When the course of the lines is obtained with tolerable accuracy, this
can easily be done,
