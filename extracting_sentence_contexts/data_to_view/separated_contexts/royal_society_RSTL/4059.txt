Fig. 17, Plate VIL., the register of April 15th, exhibits a brief disturbance, occurring
between 8 and 9, in which the photograph differs more essentially from the Green-
wich observations than in any other instance : a sharp cusp in the latter, correspond-
ing at two points to a mere bend in the former, would lead to the inference, that the
disturbing cause must have been 80 near to Greenwich as to have exerted a mate-
rially greater influence on the magnet there under observation. A singular fact is established by some of these photographs, namely, that after a
certain space of time the actinic influence spontaneously decays; for in some in-
stances the paper has been suffered to remain on the cylinder more than twelve hours ;
and consequently a second impression is made upon the paper within a very small
distance of that which had been made twelve hours previously, and while the Jatter
impression is distinetly developed, the former is very faint : fig. 6, Plate VII. is a good
illustration of this fact. The succeeding portions however of the first impression
become more and more distinct, thus showing that the decay is gradual. It appears
to commence after a period of from ten to fourteen or fifteen hours ; but the condi-
tions on which this variation of time depends have not been ascertained *,
