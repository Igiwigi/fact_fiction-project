cones. If the centres of the lines are 4 mm. apart, the distance of the test objects from the
observer should be 10 m. (see Part I). At this distance the observer will find that he can
fix either line, or the space between them, at will, and there is no evidence that the eyes
are performing oscillatory movements. From time to time the gaze does undergo chance
shifts. The observer is aware of these, and he takes steps to correct them; they are relatively
rare, unless the eyes are tired. Three explanations of the reports of other observers of the
oscillatory movements are possible: (1) that the subjects were not normal in this respect;

(2) that they were not given a sufficiently small fixation point; (3) that the method used
in making the observations was in some way unreliable.

The view that the results of Adler & Fliegelman are for some reason at variance with the
facts, is supported by the following observations. There is near the fixation point of the
author’s left eye, a small blind-spot for red rays, which can be readily identified by micro-
stimulation with light of 6400A. Since it is extremely unlikely that this spot alters its
position on the retina, the determination of the position of the fixation point for green rays

relative to this spot enables any changes in position of the green fixation point to be easily
determined. Thus, if two successive determinations vary, these variations may either be
due to experimental error or to a displacement of the fixation point, or both. In table 106
are given five successive determinations of the position of the green fixation spot in cone
units (see § 21, p. 537).
