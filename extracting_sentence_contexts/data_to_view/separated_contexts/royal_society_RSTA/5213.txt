Again, when a sound-wave is started in a mixture
Sof gases, its rate of propagation depends upon the mean density of the gaseous
‘S mixture ; there is no selective propagation of the wave by one of the constituents of
S the mixture. * This fact, of which I could find no experimental demonstration for
Egases of widely different density, has been verified, at my request, by Mr. F. J. Smrru
q in the Mmuarp Laboratory, at Trinity College, Oxford. According to Mr. SmrrH’s
& careful experiments, sound is propagated at the same rate in ammonia gas (density 8°5)
3 as in a mixture of equal volumes of hydrogen and oxygen of the same mean density as
& ammonia. E On the other hand, it may be that the wave does not advance perfectly regularly,
a but breaks, like a water-wave is broken by the quicker movement of the crest..
