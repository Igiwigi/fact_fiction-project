At present I cannot give any information relative to the distribution of vapour at
distances greater than four feet. However, from the fact, that whilst evaporation is
the most rapid, the air at the height of four feet becomes relatively drier than it
would be in consequenece of the increase of temperature alone, it is plain that much
vapour must pass upwards. In the higher strata of the atmosphere the changes of temperature are less than in
the lower strata ; and at a point not very distant from the earth, but varying in dif-
ferent seasons, the temperature must be stationary during the twenty-four hours of
the day ; we may readily infer that at a certain point above the earth, the air be-
comes relatively more moist during the course of the day whilst the ascending
current continues, and less $0 at night whilst the vapour flows downwards with the
descending current ; being exactly the reverse of the facts which take place at the
height of four feet. At some certain point above the earth, the temperature of the
dew-point, like that of the air, must be stationary during the twenty-four hours of
the day. Observations to determine the absolute quantity of water mixed with the
air, and the relative humidity at different distances from the earth, are much needed,

air, under the average temperature, humidity and pressure, at any hour, to deduce
the true weight for the month from the observations taken at that hour.
