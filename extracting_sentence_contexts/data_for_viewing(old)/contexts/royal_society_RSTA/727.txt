M. Destrade When a soft solid is subjected to an extreme deformation,
e-mail: michel.destrade@nuigalway.ie its surface (or a part of it) eventually buckles, provided
it has not ruptured before. Guided by physical intuition
and by experimental evidence (figure 1), we expect
the formation of wrinkles or creases to be arranged
orthogonally to the direction of greatest contraction, and
thus aligned with a principal direction of deformation.
However, as we show in this paper, the mathematical
equations modelling the development of such surface
instabilities do not necessarily predict that they should
be such principal wrinkles (figure 2a). In fact, we find
that for the simplest boundary value problem there is,
ie. that of a deformed semi-infinite solid, the theory
predicts that oblique wrinkles (figure 2b) should appear
on the free surface prior to the principal wrinkles.
