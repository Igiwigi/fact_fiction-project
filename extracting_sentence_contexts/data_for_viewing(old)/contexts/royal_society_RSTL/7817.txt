straight line. The position of the experimentally determined points are noted, and serve
to show how closely they lie to the straight line.

In former communications® it has been shown that a similar relation between altitude
and chemical intensity of total daylight has been found to hold good at Heidelberg,
Kew, and Pari; and that although the chemical intensity for the same altitude at dif-
ferent places and at different times of the year may greatly vary according to the vary-
ing transparency of the atmosphere, yet that the relation at the same place between
altitude and intensity is always represented by a straight line. Thus the mean inten-
sities at Lisbon and Pari for 30? are 015 and 0:44 respectively, whilst for 60” they are
0-32 and 0:80. That this variation in the direction of the straight line expressed by
the constant in the formula, given in the paper last referred to, is due to the opalescence
of the atmosphere, we have evidence of in the fact that, for equal altitudes, the higher
intensity is always found where the mean temperature of the air is greater, as in 8ummer,
when we compare the same place at different seasons, or as we approach the equator,
when we compare different places. The first of these conditions of variation is clearly
sen if we compare the Kew obseryations for the same altitudes, but for different times
of the year, The following Table clearly shows that the altitude in the warmer half of
the year is invariably accompanied by a higher chemical action than that in the colder,
and this is attributable to the varying opalescence, which is certainly a function of the
atmospheric temperature, and is less marked as we approach the summer solstice or pass
towards the equator.
