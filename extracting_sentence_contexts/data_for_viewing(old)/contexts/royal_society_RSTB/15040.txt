we used the full IBM to generate abundance projections under
two scenarios: the factual, observed climate scenario and a coun-

ing on the species. The two measures ranked models in a
different order but the model for alpine accentor scored
best in both. Separately considering the spatial and temporal
predictive accuracy (electronic supplementary material, table
A.3) showed that all models had good to excellent accuracy in

ter-factual no-climate-change scenario, which consisted of trend- the spatial predictions, as the spatial AUC ranged from 74%
corrected predictors to simulate a stationary climate. The impact to 89%, but less and more variable temporal predictive accu-
measure was then given by the ratio of projected mean adult racy, with the temporal c-index ranging from 42% to 80%
