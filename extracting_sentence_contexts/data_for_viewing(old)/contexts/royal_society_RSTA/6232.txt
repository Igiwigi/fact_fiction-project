4. Defining emergence from a mathematical perspective

David Chalmers clearly distinguishes between two types of emergence: weak and strong. A
phenomenon at a high scale is weakly emergent with respect to a lower scale if, given the
laws governing the latter, the patterns observed in the former are unexpected, but they can be
deducible in principle from advanced calculations and/or computation. If such a deduction is not
possible even in principle, then the phenomenon is strongly emergent [160]. A similar distinction
was already present in the work of Mark Bedau, who identified two hallmarks of emergence

where phenomena are either (i) somehow constituted by, and generated from, underlying [2
processes; or (ii) somehow autonomous from underlying processes [161]. The existence of >
strongly emergent phenomena would require new fundamental laws of nature for their : 8
explanation. In fact, it is argued that only the weak emergence is scientifically relevant, consistent a
with materialism and metaphysically innocent to provide a ground for a science of complexity : <
[161]. The possibility that a simple initial configuration might evolve into unexpected patterns 3
allows us to overcome the reductionist approaches while preserving the possibility for rich :3
phenomena at distinct levels of explanation and, consequently, an ultimately physicalist picture D8
of the world [160]. We capitalize on these arguments to rationalize an operational definition. : s

Let a system S be made up of a finite number of many units u that interact among them :3

and/or with the environment. Emergence is the apparition of system-wide properties or qualities
that are not present individually in the units but have their origin precisely in the interactions. Let
us assign a set of simple low-level mechanistic rules (LLMR) f[-] that allow our units to change
locally. If we indicate the state of the system at a specific time f by x(f), then such rules can be
