be less complex than those required for removal of a
sharp-edged stone flake from a flint core using a freehand
stone-knapping technique. We propose to evaluate this
relative complexity by comparing measures of task per-
formance, grip configurations, motor behaviours and the
regulation of functional parameters by adult human subjects
when performing each task.

Assuming that both tasks implied equivalent skills, sev-
eral results would be expected. (i) The rate of success in
both tasks would be comparable. (ii) If subjects performed
both tasks using the same tool, they would appropriate that
tool in the same manner, a fact which would be reflected
by a similar grasp of that tool. (iii) Comparable combinations
of motor behaviours (i.e. the form and succession of actions)
could be observed across tasks. Finally, if both tasks implied
the same skills, it would be expected that (iv) the ability to
regulate the functional parameters in one task would indicate
the ability to regulate the same parameters in the other. In
other words, the relative level of skill in one task would be
evidenced in the other.
