42. In connexion with the fact now recorded, that muscular fibre is formed of
corpuscles of the blood, an observation may be referred to which has been mentioned
by several authors; namely, that of a disposition to run into combinations, and
form objects compared by Hewsox to rolls of coin. I find it yery usual for this ap-
pearance to arise in blood obtained by a puncture (as of the finger), and to which no
addition has been made.—R. Wacxzr mentions that in blood taken from the heart of
8ome of the Invertebrata—Unio and Anodonta—when the coagulating fibrin makes its
appearance, blood-corpuscles are seen—often grouped necklace-like—around it.

43. Others have supposed muscular fibre to be formed by the blood-dises ; but I
am not aware of any facts having been observed which warranted the supposition.
It is remarkable that a conjecture on this subject in one of the papers of Sir EvErarD
Homz \ should have approached s0 near the truth. His conjecture was, © That the
globules may be the part of the blood, out of which the muscular fibres are principally
formed||.” Between Sir E. Home's observations and my own, however, it will be per-
ceived that there are material differences. For instance, he remarks, © When the
globules of the human blood lose the colouring matter, they continue floating in the
serum, and are seen to have an attraction towards one another 80 as to coalesce,
uniting themselves together,” In the altered corpuscles—that is, cells—which I
saw uniting to form muscular fibre, the colour—so far from having disappeared—
seemed (as already mentioned) to have become more intense (par. 40.).
