where it is to be noticed that 142? is the composition of 9 which is conjugate to
21°2*1, the composition which specifies the descending character, This is shown by
the zig-zag graph


MAJOR P. A. MacMAHON ON THE COMPOSITIONS OF NUMBERS, 69

Art. 6. We can now formulate the question: Of the permutations of the first 2
numbers, how many have a descending specification denoted by a given composition
of the number x? Whatever the answer, it is clear that the same answer must, in
general, he given for three other compositions, viz., the three others associated with
the zig-zag graph. In fact, from

314592768 of specification 211221,

we derive 867295413 " 2241:

and from these two by changing the number m into n—m-+1,
796518342 of specification 1422,

22112
and so forth. 243815679 ” 122112

Tn two cases there are two associated compositions instead of four, viz. :—
