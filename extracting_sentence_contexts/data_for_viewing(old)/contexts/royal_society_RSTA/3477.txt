the front or back half of the box, nor from the side window, whether the firefly is in the left or right
half of the box. The crucial point is that one cannot perform two measurements simultaneously, i.e. to look
at the front and side windows at the same time. Thus physically these observables are incompatible.
Moreover, we can construct the quantum-like mathematical model of these observations and
their probabilistic outputs including conditional measurements, e.g. first F and then S and
vice versa. In this model these observables are represented by non-commuting operators; see
Khrennikov [58,59].

This pair of observables provides only incomplete knowledge about the probability
distribution of locations of the firefly in this box. We remark that incompatibility of these
observables does not prevent the possibility of determination of so-to-say hidden variables, the
position of the firefly in the box given by the Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z). However, to determine
these coordinates we need more windows. In fact, construction of such a net of windows may
destroy the box (and, in any event, change the behaviour of this firefly). This situation is similar
to an attempt to construct a complete picture of a water aquifer or an oil reservoir by drilling a
dense net of wells, cf. the discussion in §2. In this comparison, wells play the role of windows for
the firefly box.

In the case of the firefly box, one can propose to use less destructive measurement techniques,

e.g. light photodetectors, to find the coordinates (x,y,z) of the firefly. However, their applicability
depends on the degree of transparency of the sides. By using, for example, photodetectors one
should take into account noise which is always present in space and box material. The situation is
again similar to geophysical investigation of subsurface configurations. Here we also have non-
transparency of the (Earth’s) surface combined with noise.
