Yelk-sacs long digested in a
Syeak ammoniacal solution of carmine become rather friable, but the homogeneous outer
yer retains its plasticity, and on rupture by pressure may be seen stretched across the
ping fissures of the yelk-sac, tinged faintly with the dye, but quite structureless under
â€” power of x 400, and careful illumination.
5 The micropyle may be sought for in the same way as in trout eggs. 'The aperture
t the apex is easily s8een under a power of X 200 in full face. When the pit is viewed
+ face with oblique light, it seems to have a trumpet-shaped tube, standing erect from
he bottom of it (Plate XVI. fig. 25). This appearance is due to the fact that in a
8rong illumination the clear, colourless, outer layer is quite invisible, and the trumpet-
shaped tube appearing to stand erect and unsupported, is the thick wall of the canal,
which penetrates the outer layer, where it dips into the pit, of the micropyle. The Ruffe (Acerina vulgaris). The general structure of the ripe egg is the same as in Gasterosteus.
