of the thick cellulose wall, a feature reminding one of the etching of tracheal
elements in recent Conifers by partial solution along the lines of striation. It is
difficult to estimate the length’ of these hairs, but their occurrence as long strands of
woolly threads, as seen in fig. 1, 4”, at a considerable distance from their points of
origin, and an examination of them in other sections, lead me to believe that they
reached a length of several centimetres.

Interseminal Seales and Megasporophylls.—The two longitudinal sections reproduced
in figs. 1 and 2, Plate 9, include almost the whole of the strobilus, but unfortunately
neither section shows a transition from the bracts and hairs of the lower part of the
axis to the appendages of the upper part. The transverse section reproduced in
fig. 4 was the first one cut and in its preparation the boundary between the sterile and
fertile regions must have been involved. In view of the fact that the vertical distance
between the two longitudinal sections is represented by the amount of material
destroyed in cutting the transverse section, it is clear that the bract-bearing region
was succeeded abruptly by the fertile region of the strobilus, and there cannot have
been any whorl of microsporophylls between the two as there is in the American
strobili described by WirLanp. The appendages to the upper part of the axis no
doubt originally extended to the conical apex, the actual summit of which is not
preserved (figs. 1, 35); they form a compact zone, 2 mm. broad, completely surround-
ing the axis (figs. 4, 5, s). For the most part the proximal ends of the appendages
end freely, having been separated by decay and shrinkage from the peripheral tissue
of the axis (fig. 5, s, shows a crushed piece of axis at c), but in some places the
imperfect bases of the appendages are in organic connection with the peduncle
(fig. 11, s, text-fig. 2, A, av). The appendages at first sight appear to be all of the
