irrespective of the snrface igothermals, it must have an origin dependent not on local
influences, but on others at a distance—such, in fact, as accord only with polar influences.

b. That in the North Atlantic the two channels through which the deep-seated
cold polar waters pass sonuthward are Baffin Bay and the sea near the east coast, of
Greenland ; while the shallower seas immediately west of Spitzbergen, and between
that island and Norway, are occupied to their entire depth by warmer waters flowing
northward, from equatorial regions, towards the pole.

2. That in the North Atlantic the isotherm of 35” extends further in the polar seas
than in the South Atlantic; but in both its rise is masked by the extreme climatal
variations and by surface-currents.
