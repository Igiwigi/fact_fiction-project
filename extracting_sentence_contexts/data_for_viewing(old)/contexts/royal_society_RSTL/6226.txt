010 is often reduced to a very narrow rectangular rim. The opposite apex of the
crystal is irregular, as if it had adhered to the side of the vessel, The face 0 01 is in
general rather more developed than 10 0.

The crystals are optically negative. 'The plane of the optical axes is parallel to the
line of symmetry [010]; the principal medium-line is perpendicular to the latter, and

forms an angle of about 30* with a line normal on face 001. In fact, a plate parallel
to 010 stops the passage of a ray of polarized light in that direction. Moreover, rings
are observed through the faces 0 01, and in a plane parallel to the line of symmetry
010, and rather inclined towards a line normal on such face. The angle of the optical
axes, 8een in this manner through the faces 0 0 1, appears to be very nearly 1109s.

The crystals have a very fine orange-colour and a vitreous lustre.‚Äù

This platinum-salt was the first diphosphonium-compound with which I became
acquainted, a cireumstance explaining the considerable number of analyses which were
made of this alt.
