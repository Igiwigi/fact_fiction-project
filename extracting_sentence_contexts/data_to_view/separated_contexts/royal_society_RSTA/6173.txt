We also evaluated R at the level of individual health boards in Scotland. These values
showed plausible trends, except for the smallest boards. The issue there is due to not only
insufficent data, but also the fact that rural values may be driven by incomers as already discussed
in ยง1b. Consequently, case data may not be indicative of community transmission rates in those
areas. The local authority regions in England also often have too-small numbers for accurate
evaluation, although a combination of large R and high case numbers can be indicative of local
hotspots or superspreading events.
