The concept is technically appealing, although one clearly walking on a very thin
tightrope between good-willed science and social manipulation. In principle, one can think of
society as the ‘material made up of thinking molecules’ and ask how to best design such ‘material’,
so as to optimize moral values while being bereft of cheating, with flourishing economies,
social equity and so on along a rosy-carpeted avenue. In fact, such models provide scientific
underpinning to Bauman’s illuminating metaphor of a liquid society as one where the rules
change faster than most individuals can adjust to, leaving the majority behind [13]. Influencing
human behaviour through ‘healthy’ social pressure and flow of ideas is a noble goal, albeit one
which walks on a high wire, the name of the (bad) game being plain manipulation for profit. More
precisely, what is hailed as pursuit of knowledge and innovation is, in fact, a very different goal,
named zero sales resistance.
