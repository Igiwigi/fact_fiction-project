exhibiting no signs of proliferative activity. On its surface, the underlying uterine
glands open freely into the uterine lumen. It is evident then that the ring-shaped

endometrial thickening, so characteristically developed in Nasalis, Keim 8., and in
Pithecus, Lk., does not occur in all Catarrhines. Moreover, as DucKwortH has
emphasised, there is here no implantation excavation such as we encountered in the
primary placental primordium in the two forms mentioned; on the contrary, the
endometrial tissue flooring in the intervillous blood-space is elevated above the general
level of the uterine surface. It is possible, however, that this elevation may be due,
in part at least, to fhe fact that the uterine wall around the placental site has been
artificially folded back during fixation and it may also be recalled that in Macacus
Ca, the secondary placenta had no definite implantation depression.

The chorion, like that of Keim Ca, possesses a well developed thick layer of mesen-
chyme, whilst its trophoblast as well as that of the proximal segments of the villi is
clearly distinguishable into a basal cytotrophoblast and a superficial layer of syncytium
which is thicker and less uniform than that of Keim S. (Pl. 17, fig. 101).

The villi, as already noted, are relatively short; except for a few which are quite
small, and “ free,” they are connected with the floor of the intervillous space and are
mostly simple, thin and unbranched, though a few are thicker and branched (Pl. 18,
fig. 102). Duckworru states (loc. cit. p. 300) that “ the mesoderm has not yet reached
