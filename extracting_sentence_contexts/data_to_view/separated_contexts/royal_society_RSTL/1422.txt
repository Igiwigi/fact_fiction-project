In foreign bay salt, its quantity is very
insignificant. From the table it may be seen, that the proportion of sul-
phate of lime is greater in foreign bay salt, than in any variety
of British salt, even than in those which are prepared from
sea water with a boiling heat. The only explanation of this
fact, that occurs to me, is, that during the rapid evaporation of
sea water, a considerable part of the calcareous sulphate is
precipitated at an early stage of the process, and is partly re-
moved in clearing the boiler, a process, which can scarcely be
performed: during the formation of bay salt, in pits whose

_ $ides are composed of moist clay. The remamder of the sele-
nite, thus precipitated by the rapid evaporation of sea_ water,
enters into the composition/ of the pan=scale. In the course' of this inquiry, I was induced to repeat the
same experiments s$everal times, on various Specimens of salt
bearing the same designation ; and was zurprised to find, that


of: British and Foreign Salt.
