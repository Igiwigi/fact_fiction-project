VIII. On the Nature of Ammonia and alkaline Bodies in general;
with Observations on some prospects of Discovery offered by the
preceding Facts.

Ammonia is a substance, the chemical composition of which
has always been considered of late years as most perfectly
ascertained, and the apparent conversion of it into hydrogene
and nitrogene, in the experiments of SCHEELE, PRIESTLEY,
and the more refined and accurate experiments of BERTHOLLET,
had left no doubt of its nature in the minds of the most en-
lightened chemists.

All new facts must be accompanied however by a train of
analogies, and often by suspicions with regard to the accuracy
of former conclusions. As the two fixed alkalies contain a
small quantity of oxygene united to peculiar bases, may not
the volatile alkali likewise contain it? was a query which
s00N occurred to me in the course of enquiry ; and in perusing
the accounts of the various experiments made on the subject,
some of which I had carefully repeated, I saw no reason to
consider the circumstance as impossible. For supposing
hydrogene and nitrogene to exist in combination with oxy-
gene in low proportion, this last principle might easily dis-
appear in the analytical experiments of decomposition by heat
and electricity, in water deposited upon the vessels employed
