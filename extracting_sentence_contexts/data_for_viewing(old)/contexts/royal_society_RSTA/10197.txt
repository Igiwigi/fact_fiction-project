constants for the two ions could be taken as approximately equal, reduced to the form
7 =C,™C,™. In this form Euuer (‘Zeit. f. Phys. Chem.,’ 25, 536, 1898) further
investigated the matter. Neither of these formule turned out to be of general
validity.

Grinersen* (‘Wiss Abh. der Phys.-Tech. Reichsanstalt,’ 4, 239, 1905) has
elaborated a very accurate formula which takes the form

7h = Aat+B(1—a) +Cm,

where « is the coefficient of ionisation. GriNEIsEN has given the constants A, B,
and © for a large number of electrolytes, and the formula brings out the important
fact that the equivalent viscosity increment for electrolytes has a minimum value at
concentrations varying from normal to $ normal. But GrRiNEISEN’s results stop
short of furnishing a theoretical explanation of the facts. He observes (loc. cit.,
p. 250) :—

“That the minimum found with electrolytes should result from experimental errors,
I regard as impossible. The only doubt is whether it is peculiar to electrolytes. I
held this idea at first, but further experiments are certainly desirable. This suggests
the possibility that the phenomenon may be accounted for by the dissociation of the
molecules. On this supposition, the increase of the equivalent viscosity increment at
greater dilution would be most simply explained by assuming that the dissociation of
the molecule always increases the friction of the solution.”
