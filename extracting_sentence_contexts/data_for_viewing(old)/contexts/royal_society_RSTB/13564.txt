Figure 1. A UPGMA tree calculated using our syntactic distances. The groups of languages which have been used as an input for the test (which are then rep-
resented under a unique node) are in blue, while the branches which have been shown to be related by the test are in green. The relationships in these green
branches can be considered ‘validated’ by both our statistical test and the UPGMA clustering algorithm.

controversial, ‘micro-Altaic’ including only Tungusic, Turkic the results of our experiment reduced them to only two (a
and Mongolian, which displays a mean even lower than Japanese/Korean unity and ‘micro-Altaic’). We must then
Finno-Ugric (see [57]). build this information into the algorithm for modelling poss-

ible languages and thus Artificial Distances: as a result, the
median goes up to 0.5 (with a mean of 0.497), and the signifi-
cance threshold rises to 0.316, which includes the average
distance between the Uralic and Altaic languages of our
sample. This new result is due to the fact that the algorithm
was over-sampling artificial languages with an Altaic bias
(cf. §3a). When we consider Japanese/Korean and ‘micro-
Altaic’ as two families (instead of five), then Uralo-Altaic
becomes a statistically plausible macro-family too.

(f) Uralo-Altaic

The next macro-family our tree points to, Uralo-Altaic, is also
far from established, although it has been suggested in the
literature [58-61]. By comparing the cross-family distances
between ‘micro-Altaic’ and the Finno-Ugric languages, one
obtains the following result:
