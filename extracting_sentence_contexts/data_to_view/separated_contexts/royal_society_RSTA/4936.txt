And although he was initially distrustful of
mathematics, regarding it as obstructing rather than helping our understanding of the workings
of Nature, he would, later in life, change his view in the light of the work of James Clerk Maxwell. In fact, Maxwell himself regarded Faraday as being an excellent theoretician and claimed this was
the reason he was able to put Faraday’s theories into the language of analytical mathematics. It is
important to point out that there are in fact three concepts that are intricately linked in Faraday’s
research: an electric current, a magnetic field and mechanical motion, and it is the interplay
between these three that is the constant theme throughout his work. In September 1821, he built
a device that can be regarded as the very first electric motor. He showed that a suspended wire
hanging freely in a container of mercury with a permanent magnet in its centre would rotate
around the magnet once an electric current was passed through it (with the conducting mercury
completing the circuit).
