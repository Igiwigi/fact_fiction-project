Received and Read December 10, 1835. As the following Memoranda, noted down during the remarkable Aurora of the 18th
of November, have been considered of sufficient interest to be read before the Royal
Society, I think it right to state, that I did not anticipate that this would be the
case, and that my only object in making them was, to record carefully whatever re-
markable appearance might present itself, for the information of one who, I knew,
felt a deep interest in every phenomenon of the kind, and whose simultaneous obser-
vations I hoped to have the pleasure of comparing with my own. Being, however,
unwilling to make any alteration in a statement of facts, I have preferred leaving
them exactly as they were communicated, merely offering a few additional explana-
tions and remarks, suggested by striking exhibitions of the phenomenon,

Memoranda. Wednesday evening, 9 o'clock.——Remarked, on looking accidentally from the
drawing-room window of Deal Castle, a bright light over Ramsgate, exactly as if the
moon were aþout to rise in that quarter. Saw, on proceeding to the roof, a perfect
and very bright arch to the north ; the lower edge being sharply defined on the dark
cloud beneath, the upper shaded off into the sky.
