It may at once be said that all the
evidence showed that the vascular pressure in the splanchnic area was affected by the
venom in exactly the same way as was the general blood pressure. It in no sense
reacted independently. In fact, it is possible to trace each change of general blood
pressure on the plethysmographic tracings. With cardiac inhibition or with cardiac
recovery they move down or up together, whilst the constriction of their respective
vessels by the direct action of the venom on their walls is indicated by a downward move-
ment of the plethysmographic lever and an upward movement of the manometer needle. These results clearly support the conclusion arrived at by Dr. PRENTICE and myself,
that the vaso-motor centre is not profoundly affected by Cobra poison, and that the
final fall of blood pressure in cobraism is not due to a paresis of this centre.
