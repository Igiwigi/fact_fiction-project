The number of its mesenteries, and
the distribution with regard to them of the retractor muscles, the form and number of
its tentacles, are decisive evidence in the matter; and this evidence is borne out by
almost every item of histological structure. In the peculiar manner in which the re-
traction of the tentacles takes place, viz. by introversion, Heliopor seems to differ from

+ Received February 28, 1876.â€”In the nurse-stocks of several g8pecies of Fungia a kind of intracali-
cinal gemmation appears to take place. On the geparation of a young free Fungia from the nurse-stock,
the next free Pungia buds out from the centre of the scar left on the stem, 4. e. from what has once been
the centre of the calicle of the stock. (See Spares, Generationswechsel bei Steinkorallen.) IT haye lately
found a yery fine specimen of the nurse-stocks of a large species of Pungia at Tahiti, and haye been able
to seo this fact quite plainly. Tt is owing to this mode of growth that the stems of the nurse-stock
become jointed,

all other Alcyonarians except Corallium*. From both Corallinm and Tubipora, Helio-
pora differs in that the hard tissue of its corallum hows no 8igns of being composed of
fused spicules, but in its histological structure most closely resembles Zoantharian
Corals.
