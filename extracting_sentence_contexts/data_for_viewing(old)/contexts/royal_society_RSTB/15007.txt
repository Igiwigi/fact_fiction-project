Based on our results, we are unable to accept or reject the
NLH definitively. Seemingly, contrary to our prediction, bird
species living in urban areas do not use ANMs more often.
Furthermore, few (10%) of human-made items in avian
nests are integrated into the structural part of nests which
would also go against the expectations of this hypothesis.
However, owing to the high percentage (approx. 87%) of
records with no specific information, we are uncertain of
the patterns of usage of ANMs. Thus, we assume if plastic
items can be more easily used with structural functions
than other categories such as cloth or paper, this is an intri-
guing possibility albeit an untested one. In fact, plastic is
the only ANM suggested to provide a strengthening benefit
for birdsâ€™ nests [31,76] and the four main plastic subcategories
in avian nests could make them optimal as structural
materials considering their characteristics such as hardness
or length. More specific information on the usage of ANMs
by birds is urgently needed to test their functions in nests.

We found that nest type was as an important life-history ; :
trait that significantly affected the use of ANMs by birds. For methodology for studies in this topic, particularly in the
instance, ANMs were seldom found in domed nests, a result quantification of ANMs because some studies have used
that persisted in three of the four minimal models con- images of nests [62,96] or nest dissection [20,26,27] to generate
structed in which it always had a negative association. This ANM data. Even those studies using the latter method do not
