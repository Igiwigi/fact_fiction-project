To incorporate this deduction into the method of solution one may proceed as before
until equation E (14) is reached and then take account of the fact that y_ = B/log &

when & is small, and yy, = when & is nearly equal to 2k, B and C being

C
log (2k — &x)
regarded as undetermined multipliers to be found subsequently, Equation E (16)
will then become

where « is some small quantity arbitrarily chosen. The integrals of E (26) are not
determinable so simply as those of E (15) but numerical evaluation does not present
any formidable difficulties.
