But they did
continueâ€™ to extend round the half-apex which carried the centre of P,, extending through
the tissue adjacent to the wound and above it. On the other hand, when the split was
made later in the plastochron so that the flanks of P, were severed by the cut, then the
flanks continued to extend round the half-apex remote from the leaf centre, but not round
the half carrying that centre. The facts therefore indicate that the tips of the flanks of
a leaf when once they are formed tend to extend round the apex or half-apex on which
they are situated without needing any influence from the leaf centre for their further
growth, and also that the flanks are determined later than the centre. Thus the manner of initiation and development of a primordium in Rhoeo appears to
differ from that which was found in the dicotyledon Lupinus albus previously investigated. For we concluded (1931, 1933) that in L. albus a leaf primordium was determined as a whole
as soon as a space was available both wide enough and low enough for it.
