forward out of it (fig. 1a, Plate 1).

The division of the protoplast takes about 30 min. Some stages of the division
followed in single cells are shown in figs. 2 and 3 (Plate 1). The main bulk of proto-
plasm is concentrated near the centre of the cell, usually connected by two protoplasmic
strands with the centre of the valves (fig. 2a, Plate 1). The division begins at the
periphery of the cell and proceeds towards the centre. It is unlike the division of other
Protozoa and Algae in that the incision is very broad from the beginning. The proto-
plast takes the shape of a dumbbell (fig. 24, Plate 1), the prospective daughter cells
being connected with each other by a protoplasmic bridge. This connexion becomes
gradually very fine and eventually gets resorbed (figs. 2c-e, 3a-c, Plate 1), leaving a
wide empty space between the daughter cells. The way in which the protoplasm is
drawn out in the course of division, and the fact that the protoplasts of the two
daughter cells together fill a space far smaller than the original parental one 20 or
30 min. before, suggest the existence of a strong bipolar tension prior to and during
the division. The new central spines are formed a short time after cell division (fig. 2/,
Plate 1, 8 min.; fig. 3e, Plate 1, about 40 min.) and most probably before the formation
of the new valves. During their growth the spines are soft and whenever they touch
another object—the opposite spine (fig. 1d, Plate 1) or the primary valve (fig. 74, ¢,
Plate 2)—they are liable to become bent. The growth of the spines takes $ hr. at most,
The separation of the cells, however, takes place several hours later, after the formation
of the small spines and the silicification of the new valves.
