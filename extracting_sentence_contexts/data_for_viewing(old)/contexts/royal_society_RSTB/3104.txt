The largest outgrowths, the most rapidly formed, and those which show the
greatest histological and cytological changes, are developed when, given the necessary
physiological condition of the plant, the external conditions are changed suddenly.
The cause of this appears to be that the changed conditions alter the course of
metabolism too quickly for the plant to accommodate itself to them. As was pointed
out above, in the leaf intumescences of the Potato there is little cell division and
formation of new tissue, but merely a distension of already existing cells. In
Hibiscus, on the other hand, there is considerable actual growth, in the sense of
the formation of new tissue elements by cell division. In stem outgrowths there
is still more division, so that large masses of tissue are formed, which in some cases
are almost indistinguishable from wound-callus.

It, therefore, seems probable that the fact that the outgrowths usually begin
in the green cells is to be explained by the relation between assimilation, turgescence,
and growth. In this connection it would be interesting to know if the intumescences
described by Soraver* in the flowers of the orchid Cymbidium Lowi occurred in
tissues containing either chloroplasts or leucoplasts. Neither the description nor
the figure elucidates this point.

The experiments on the estimation of acids and salts in potato shoots (p. 243)
show that the substance causing the excessive turgescence, which is the first visible
stage in the formation of intumescences, is not an acid or salt which is confined to
the affected organs, nor, indeed, anything peculiar to plants bearing intumescences.

Again, the experiments with small fragments of potato leaves (p. 225) show that
