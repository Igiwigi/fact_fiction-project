His paper contains
an interesting account of the pits, with careful sections and good drawings of the worked
flints, and the geological questions are more fully discussed. These observations did not, however, attract the attention they deserved, and, with
few exceptions, the discovery of M. BovcurR DE PERTHES remained unknown to, or was
considered inconclusive by, antiquaries and geologists both in France and England. The question was in this state when attention was again directed to it by the eminent
palwontologist Dr. FaLcoxER®, and received especially a fresh impulse by his discovery
of flint-implements associated with the bones of extinct animals in Brixham Cave,—then in
course of exploration at his instigation under the auspices of the Royal Society, —a fact
announced by Mr. PEXGELLY to the British Axsociation in 1858. As the report on this
important inquiry has not yet been presented to the Royal Society, I now merely mention
this fact, to instance the weight such evidence, s0 carefully worked out, had in modifying
previously received and generally entertained views, and in inciting further research. It was not, however, until I had myself witnessed the conditions under which these
flint-implements had been found at Brixham, that I became fully impressed with the
validity of the doubts thrown upon the previously prevailing opinions with respect to
such remains in caves.
