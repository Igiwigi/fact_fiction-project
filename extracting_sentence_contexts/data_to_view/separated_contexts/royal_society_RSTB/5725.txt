Before the bundle enters the free part of the rachis the protoxylem
has already forked, and for a time the diverging protoxylems remain connected together
by a row of small tracheids in the tangential plane. This “ protoxylem bridge ”
sometimes extends for a considerable distance up into the petiole (fig. 31, Plate 8). and it afforded the first clue to the fact (confirmed only after further sections had been
cut) that initially there is a single centrally placed protoxylem, as in Asterochlenopsis
(SAHNI, 1930, p. 63, and figs. 16-23, Plate 51),

At its very base the free petiole contains an elliptical bipolar strand ; this is of a more

* The possibility should, however, be kept in view that the part of the peripheral zone immediately round

the stellate core may be of primary origin.
