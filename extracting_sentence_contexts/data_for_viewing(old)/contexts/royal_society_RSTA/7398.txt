PART 1. OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS
2. OUTLINE OF EARLIER WORK

Whistlers were discovered by Barkhausen in the course of some investigations of earth
currents, and he published the first account of them in 1919. A much earlier note by Preece
(1894) on some telegraph-line interference may possibly relate to whistlers, but his descrip-
tion is too vague to make the identification certain. Subsequently they were studied both
in England by Eckersley (1925, 1926, 1928, 1931), of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co.,
Chelmsford, and in America by Burton (1930) and Burton & Boardman (1933) at the
laboratories of the Bell Telephone Co. The last named secured recordings of the whistlers
and related phenomena, some of which have recently been analyzed by Potter (1951) on the
‘sound spectrograph’. Through these investigations the following facts were known at the
outset of the present work.

Whistlers are often heard to come one or two seconds after ‘click’ type atmospherics. The
nature and location of the sources of these atmospherics were both uncertain; there was
