Tn those Lamellibranchia with organic interfilamentar junctions (¢.e., the Eulamelli-
branchia plus the Pinnide, Ostreide, and Limidze—an assemblage which it is
proposed to term the Synaptorhabda, see p. 186), the chitin in these junctions is
remarkably thick and fibrous in character. It is continuous with the chitin of the
filaments, which at the levels of the interfilamentar junctions is much thicker than
usual, the thickening taking place at the expense of the filamentar cavity. In fact,
in a great many of the forms the cavity of the filament, even in the regions between
the interfilamentar junctions, can hardly be said to exist, an obliteration of the space
being effected either by the excessive thickening of the chitin, or by an exceptional
development of lacunar tissue which has intruded into the filamentar cavity (e.g.,
Anodonta, Lucina, fig. 24A, p. 227). A pale-staining chitin is sometimes met with in conjunction with the normal,
deeply staining chitin.
