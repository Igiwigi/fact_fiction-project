These components are
the primary candidates for our investigation of the wave-turbulence interactions directly. This
wave-turbulence separation is based only on EMD without explicit dynamical considerations. As EMD can separate components with physical significance, we believe the dynamics are in fact
the determining factor implicitly. The results of this separation are also shown in the spectral
from in figure 2a. Granted that the wave-turbulence interactions are nonlinear in nature, this
additive extraction should not be expected to be complete.
