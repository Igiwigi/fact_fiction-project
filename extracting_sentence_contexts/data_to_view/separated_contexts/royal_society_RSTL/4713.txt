This especially consists in making
| sections, of each bone to be examined, in every direction that appeared likely to
reveal any new feature of its structure, and examining the same bone, as far as was
possible, in fishes of different ages. The result has satisfied me that Professor
SHARPEY'S views not only receive the clearest possible confirmation from the study of
the developing bones of osseous and cartilaginous fish, but that a large amount of
additional light is thrown upon those views by such a study of the less advanced
members of the vertebrate series. Dr. Snarrgy has pointed out the fact that two distinet processes are put in opera-
tion during the growth of a mammalian bone. The first is the development of a car-

A tilaginous matrix and the deposition of calcareous matter in its intercellular suh-
Ãž stance; the second is a deposition of similar matter in the fibrous membranes of the
E investing periosteum and perichondrium, prolongations of which, dipping into the
by interior of the organism, exhibit the same tendency to become calcified. = Both these processes exist amongst fishes, leading by their various modifications
SD to yery diversified results.
