in the turning as well as in the cooling experiments, and there is no reason to suppose
that it was markedly different in the two cases. The only remaining possibility seems to be that the 57 per cent. increase in the
R.M.S. is a real effect of the coolings—a view which receives some support from the
fact that the two independent values of which 57 is the mean (60 per cent. in
KirkPATRICK’s work and 54 per cent. in that of the writer) are in such close
agreement.
