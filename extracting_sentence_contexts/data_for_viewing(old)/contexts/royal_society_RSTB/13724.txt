Nicolas Caidiere 1. Introduction

e-mail: nicolas.claidiere@cnrs.fr Conventions have often been overlooked in the literature on social learning

despite the fact that they form an essential part of human social and cultural
behaviour [1] and may also be important to other animal societies. Only a
few rare examples of non-human conventions have been documented (see [2]
for a discussion of non-human conventions), despite the existence of evolution-
ary precursors [3]. The first part of this article discusses current evidence of
conventions in non-human primates and concludes that conventions ought to
be more frequently observed. The scarcity of convention has been explained
by the limited social learning capacities of non-human primates, especially
regarding imitation. However, in the second part of the article, we present a
set of experiments showing the emergence of convention in a non-human pri-
mate using a unique novel experimental system. These experiments show that
Guinea baboons (Papio papio) can readily develop conventions that share at least
three properties of human conventions (arbitrariness, stability and efficiency)
