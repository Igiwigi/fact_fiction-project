cidence with the curye of temperature is greater throughout than we could have
expected, considering the important difference of cireumstances which occur in
autumn and in spring when the thermometer stands nearly alike, the first chill of
autumn depriving the glacier of its fluid pressure more effectually than the severer
cold of winter which is tempered by its snowy covering, whilst in spring the first re-
laxation of the bands of frost saturates the icy mass with the impetuous streams of
melted snow, as effectually as theintensest heat of summer. In fact, the velocity would
probably be greatest in spring, were it not that then the ice has attained its greatest
consolidation by the slow but continued effect of the winter's cold penetrating its
upper layers, though after all probably to no very great depth. But this is undoubt-
edly the reason why the minimum and maximum approach s0 near to one another in
point of time in the torrential glacier of Bossons, and it receives an important illus-
tration from the independent fact of the observed condition of the source of the
Arveiron, which (see the Meteorological Register), though very small in February,
was 8till whitish and dirty before a change of weather, showing that the bands of
frost were not 80 strong as to prevent a temporary relaxation of thaw throughout the
mass of the glacier even in winter; and although the mean temperature of the air
had been rising ever since the middle of January, and the greatest cold had occurred
early in February, we find that at the end of March the source of the Arveiron was
