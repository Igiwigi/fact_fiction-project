The position of the bright band observed on the 8th of November isnear C, but slightly
less refrangible, not far from the place in the scale occupied by the last discovered red
line, the position of which as yet has not been micrometrically determined. Other regions to which my attention has been particularly drawn from the first,
although up to the present time I have obtained no results, lie, one between the þ lines,
another between þ and F, another less refrangible than B, one near D, and another near G. It is quite possible that these bright regions, the light of which is variable, may be
due to faculze; this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that diligent sweeping within
the limb has not revealed the bright lines of the chromosphere spectrum. If this be $0,
the faculz are not the prominences, although they may be possibly connected with them. On the nature of the Chromosphere and Prominences.
