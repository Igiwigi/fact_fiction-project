A number of metaphase plates from the first
division were measured and their diameters compared with a similar measurement of
those of the second. The average diameter of the metaphase plate in the first division
was 1-6 Â», while that of the second division was 0-8 wu. This fact was also clearly
brought out by a comparison of Plate 19, fig. 6, with Plate 19, fig. 8.
