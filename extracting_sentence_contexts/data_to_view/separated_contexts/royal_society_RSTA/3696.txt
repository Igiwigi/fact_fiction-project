These quantities define box-to-box rate coefficients, which can then be used
to calculate a potential of mean force, which is independent of the boundary locations. Choosing
BXD boundaries is analogous to the process of specifying umbrellas (in umbrella sampling). A
key difference is the fact that umbrella sampling requires two parameters per umbrella (location
and force constant), whereas BXD requires only one parameter (location). While the latest BXD
algorithms are able to adaptively determine the most computationally optimal box boundary
locations [36] without requiring user specification, this capability was not available at the time
the work described in this paper was carried out, and BXD boundaries were specified the ‘old-
fashioned’ way (via user trial and error). In order to calculate thermal dissociation rate coefficients, we performed BXD simulations
from 700 K to 1300 K in 100 K intervals.
