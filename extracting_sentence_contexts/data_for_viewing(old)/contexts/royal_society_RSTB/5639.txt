Text-ria. 18.—Body-forms (diagrammatic) of torrent-inhabiting animals. a, b, c= forms of animals
that dangle freely in the current; d, e, f, g, h, 1,7 = forms of animals that lie closely pressed to the
substratum, d, e, f = showing progressive modification towards tapering of the form (compare
strut types B.F. 34 and B.F. 35). g, h, i = showing progressive modification towards limpet-like
form (compare strut type Baby). a= Rhyacophilid Trichopterous larva; 6 =form of free-
swimming fish such as Barbus tor; ¢ = Betisnymph; d =a Balitora fish; e =a Phractura fish ;
f =a Farlowella fish ; g =a Gastromyzon fish ; h = nymph of Iron; i=a Psephenid larva, and
j =a Planarian.

explanation is, in fact, no explanation. Animals with different forms live under different
conditions, and in every case there is a fine adjustment between external form and the
environmental factors. For example, the animals that dangle freely in the current,
such as the larvee of Simuliwm, the nymphs of Betis or the Aischnine living on bare rocks
and among plants like Nephelopteryx, have a cylindrical tapering form. The current
flows freely on all sides of these animals, and therefore on every side they must present
a stream-line form, and this is only possible by assuming the cylindrical tapering form
which they possess. As soon as they begin to rest on the substratum, the ventral surface
is not influenced by the current and, therefore, the stream-line form is replaced by a
