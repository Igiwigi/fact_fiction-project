and this same equation could have been deduced from (45) instead of (44). Equation (47) is more general than (43) since the two constants Ky, K, have
disappeared. In fact equation (47), being a differential equation of the second order,
will contain two arbitrary constants in its solution, and these correspond to the two
missing constants K, and K,. We can, however, determine Ky, K, in terms of
these two arbitrary constants, and if these constants are chosen so as to give the
right values for Ky, Kj, the solution of (47) will be equivalent to the original
equation (48),

To determine Ky, K,, put 7 = R, in (44) and we obtain

Hence we see that equation (43) is exactly equivalent to the three equations
(47), (48), and (49).

§ 16. Comparing (42) with (43), it appears that (42) is exactly equivalent to the
following equations :—
