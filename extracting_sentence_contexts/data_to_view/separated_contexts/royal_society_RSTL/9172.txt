Dedneting this from the mean 8, we
have #, the measure of the auxiliar tension.*

The largest oscillation which I have observed under this arrangement was 54%;
the wind was moderate, V being only 16". This is equivalent to a change of tension
=764 grains at the cups, nearly 04 of the entire tension there. I cannot account for
the great irregularities of this friction, but T believe similar facts have been observed
on a large scale in applying Proxy's brake to machinery. The extent and frequency
of the oxcillations do not seem to follow any regular law of V or », thongh they
evidently are related to them.

(67.) The process described in paragraph (58) gives for each observation an equation
containing three unknown quantities, a, «-, y, and two unknown variables, V and V”,
or V+w, w being the difference of wind at the two instruments. Tt is shown by
Table XX. that w may be considerable for a few seconds, but when the time is a few
minutes it is probably confined within the limits +3.
