I shall refer to it
as “the influence of immediate atmosphere,” where I understand the “atmosphere” to
be compounded of all the little sources which affect either the observed thing or the
observer more or less persistently during a short series. I am prepared to be told

that the influence of immediate atmosphere was something peculiar to our own test
experiments. But I shall require a good deal of the hard logic of experimental facts

to be convinced that it has no existence in astronomical observations. There are

many determinations of astronomical personal equation, but in published data I have

been unable to discover enough material to determine how far the admitted variations

in personal equation for short series are or are not of the order of deviations due to

random sampling. The following data will bring out the points of this discussion :—
