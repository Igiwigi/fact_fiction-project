The social science of demography has engaged with the
question of why fertility varies for decades, initially focusing
on population-level trends. Theories of the fertility transition
(the decline in fertility which has followed, or happened in
tandem with, mortality decline and economic development
worldwide over the last few centuries: figure 1b) extend
back to the 1920s [13]. More recently, demographers have
attempted to explain population-level phenomena by trying
to understand individual behaviour. A vast body of research
now exists on fertility, documenting, describing, and partially
