we have to speak of art’ (my translation of the Italian original in [62, p. 64]). Then the question,
in mathematics as in all the other human creative activities, is the level of the aesthetic content,
its density in a work and the permanence in time of the work itself. It is not simply a question



of getting something down to a fine art, ie. applying in rigorous and impeccable manner known
techniques. Rather it is matter of adopting some available techniques and inventing new ones in
order to create something inimitable for it is unique and imitable for it is a potentially unavoidable
influencing reference. We can list several examples and we can quite affirm that the research in
mathematics nourishes itself and is addressed by such duplicity.

Questions emerge. In fact, in defining creativity according to the indications at the beginning
of this section, we need some clarifications. What is the meaning of new? Does ‘new’ refer to
a not-previously existing concept, or else to a not-previously accepted or imagined use of an
existing concept or interpretation of it? Is there any unquestionable definition of non-triviality
or else is it matter of the evaluator’s imagination and culture? When is a model concretely
effective?

The evident possibility of ambiguity and/or incompleteness in proposing answers to the
previous questions exposes who would like to delineate exactly the boundaries of creativity, in =
particular in mechanics, with a formal scheme to the concrete risk of constructing it just on an :
implicit self-referential inconsistent dream.

We do not know exactly what creativity be but we can say that it includes the ability of go nee)
