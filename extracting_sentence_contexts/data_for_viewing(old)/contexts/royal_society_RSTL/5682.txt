2 Generally speaking, all the arteries of a web are found in the same degree of contrac-
S tion at any one time; but here, one of the vessels under observation was sometimes
E small, when the other, though in the same web, was large ; and not only was there no
E proportion between the degrees of contraction in the two vessels, but in one and the
&E 8ame artery the amount of constriction was very different at different parts. The
E unusual character of these contractions implied that they were caused by some unwonted
E eircumstances; and from their coincidence with the almost total arrest of the blood, as
E well as from the fact that in the left foot, where the circulation continued free, the
= arteries remained of full size till the animal was destroyed, I was led to conclude that
L the puzzling appearances in question must be in some way or other dependent on the
S cexsation of the flow of the vital fluid through the vessels. If this were 80, it seemed
probable that the mechaniszm by which these irregular contractions were induced might
A be as local as their exciting cause, in which case they would be seen to occur in an
amputated limb. In order to determine this point I made the following experiment.
On the 2nd of April, 1858, having passed a knife between the brain and cord of a large
frog 80 as to render the legs insensible, and having ascertained that the arterial con-
striction resulting from that operation had subsided, I placed a ligature round one of
the thighs, and then amputated the limb at a higher point. The application of the
ligature not only prevented the blood from escaping, but produced considerable tension
in the 8oft parts of the thigh ; and on examining the webs, I found the arteries fully
