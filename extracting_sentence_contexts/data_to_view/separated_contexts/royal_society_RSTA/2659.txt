MR. R. V. SOUTHWELL ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF ELASTIC STABILITY. 189

problems which can be treated by the ordinary theory of elasticity ; but it is not
legitimate to conclude that instability is only possible, even if its conditions were only
ealculable, in the case of materials which obey Hooker's Law, and there is no warrant
for the employment of “ crushing formule” in the design of short struts and thick
boiler flues. *

A more serious weakness in the existing theory of elastic stability, when regarded
from the mathematical standpoint, is the fact that the methods which it employs are
admittedly only approximate. The higher the elastic limit} of the material under
consideration, the less adequate are these methods to deal with the whole range of
problems which should come within its scope. In fact, we are faced with the
anomaly that, while in its ordinary applications the theory of elasticity is not
concerned with the conception of an elastic limit, in questions of stability the
existence of finite limits is an essential condition for the adequacy of its results.
