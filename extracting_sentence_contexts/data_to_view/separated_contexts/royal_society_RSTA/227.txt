FicurE 8

21. Owing to the possibility of ‘irregular stars’ of which the interrupted arms may
have either the z- or r-direction or both, general treatment of (30) is not worth while

and every case calls for special consideration. No great difficulty is confronted when the
only interrupted arm has the direction Or (figure 8) : yp has been determined from (29),
and xp can be expressed (approximately) in terms of yj and y, (2 being a ‘fictitious
point’) by the formula

Xp = 9+ Xa+ (1) Xo» (i)
in which 74 denotes the length of the interrupted arm OP; to the same approximation
we may write

0). = X2— Xo» m7) = Vp—Yo, (ii)

and (dy/dz), can be related with (dy/dr), by the second of (11), written in the equivalent
form

yes (11) B

so, for the point P in figure 8, the required approximation to (30) is
