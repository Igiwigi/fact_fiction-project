MR. BELL ON THE NERVES OF THE FACE. 327

whose jaws are prehensile and used as hands. This curious fact, originally
drawn from the anatomy and now confirmed by it, had nearly been obscured
by experiment ; since the external branches of the fifth nerve, those most ex-
posed to the experimenter, are not muscular. I am bound to acknowledge here the correction by M. Macxnp1E, in regard
to the office of the suborbital division-of this nerve, since it has given occasion
to the revisal of the anatomy#*. We were: inyolyed in great confusion by the discovery of new branches of
nerves and of ganglions, through which we had no guide, until we formed a
correct arrangement of the whole system.
