nasalis (Â¢.n.) (superior or posterior turbinal of other authors) formed by the concave
paranasal cartilage is plainly visible.

The olfactory nerve passes out of the cranial cavity through a foramen olfactorium
evehens (f.0.e.), which is bordered by the front edge and preoptic root of the anterior
orbital carilage (0.c.a.), the sphenethmoid commissure (se.c.), the nasal septum, and
part of the hind edge of the parietotectal cartilage (pt.c.). The olfactory nerve then
finds itself for a short distance in the orbit, which it leaves by the foramen olfactorium
advehens (f.0.a.) for the cavity of the nasal capsule. The latter foramen is difficult
to delimit, but its boundaries may be said to be constituted medially by the nasal
septum ; anteriorly and laterally by the hind edge of the parietotectal cartilage ;
and posteriorly by the dorsal edge of the planun antorbitale. The orbitonasal fissure
is still more difficult to define, owing to the fact that it is so very large; its medial
boundary is the interorbital septum and preoptic root of the orbital cartilage ; its
ventral boundary is the dorsal edge of the planum antorbitale ; its dorsal boundary
is the sphenethmoid commissure, while its lateral boundary is formed by part of the
hind edge of the parietotectal cartilage.

Difficult as these relations are to make out, it is important to define them at this
stage, for, as will be seen, at subsequent stages most of the landmarks will have
either disappeared, or undergone modification and displacement. Indeed, a certain
amount of displacement has already occurred ; the preoptic root of the orbital cartilage
has been carried up to a great height dorsally by the phenomenal development of the
interorbital septum, and the parietotectal cartilage will soon begin to extend backwards,
dorsally to the foramen olfactorium evehens.
