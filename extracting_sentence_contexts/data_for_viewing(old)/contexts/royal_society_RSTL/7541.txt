Torsion in portion of rod between mirrors . . . *-00661,
Flexure in portion of rod between mirrors . . . *-00519,

these numbers (which are in circular measure) being obtained by dividing T and
respectively reduced to centimetres by 445-6, which is twice the height of -scale aboye
mirrors. 'They must now be multiplied by 4343, which is the ratio of all that portion of
the rod subjected to torsion and flexure to the portion between mirrors, and also by the
constant, number +729 (se last paper, p. 143). The products thus obtained are -0074
and :0058 ; hence the mechanical corrections of T and F are

+-0074 T and +:0058 F.
The optical correction (which I am told was too briefly described in my last paper) is
dependent on the fact that the ray from scale to mirror is not precisely vertical, and

therefore not truly perpendicular to the scale, which is horizontal. Tt is determined by
measuringâ€”

(1) Height of scale above mirrors, by
(2) Distance of yertical through centre of scale from line joining centres of mirrors.
(3) Distances, resolved parallel to rod, of vertical through centre of scale from centre x
of each mirror. Tl
These three distances suffice to determine the corrections both for torsion and flexure,
on the hypothesis that the centre of the scale comes into the field of view of both tele-
