(Photos. 58, 59, and 60, Plate 9.)

The only Angiospermic fructification which we have yet found among the
fragments of this Cretaceous flora appears to have been fairly plentiful, for in three
nodules we have seven distinct specimens,

The sections described are principally from block 1 YA, which has parts of five distinct
specimens. Among them are two specimens in which there is preserved round the
ovary some portion of foliar structure which may be a scale, but is more likely to be
a perianth, as it is attached to two carpels in one of the ovaries.

It is unfortunate that none of the individual specimens are cut in more than one
section, but this fact assists in determining their size, for it indicates that they must
be not more than 3 mm. in vertical height or they would appear in a second section
in the series containing transverse ones of the ovary. The sections are all transverse
or transverse-oblique, no longitudinal section has been recognised.

The ovary is trilocular, the three loculi being of the same size ; they are united in the
centre with axile placentation. The diameter of the whole is about 2 mm. and
presumably the vertical height is not much greater. As is seen in Phot. 58, Plate 9,
the carpels are rounded off where not in contact, and the whole ovary was presumably
globular.

Wall of Ovary.â€”As preserved in most of the sections, the wall of the ovary is
not massive, consisting of a zone of three or four well-preserved cells with a streak of
