This is probably a secondary adaptation to their environment, for the larvae live on
fallen branches which are liable to become dry. As all Mycetophilid larvae require
a saturated atmosphere for respiration, the body of Phronia is shortened to enable the
larva to withstand adverse conditions, thus exposing less cuticular surface and so
preventing excessive evaporation. That this shortening is a secondary adaptation
is supported by the fact that the alimentary canal, which is straight in all other
Mycetophilid larvae, is coiled on itself in Phronia (fig. 318). Moreover, Phronia
annulata is provided with spinulae on the dorsal surface and short hairs in the vicinity
of the spiraclesâ€”a unique condition in Mycetophilid larvae and possibly an adapta-
tion to reduce surface evaporation. Phronia strenua carries an excremental test
which may serve a similar purpose.
