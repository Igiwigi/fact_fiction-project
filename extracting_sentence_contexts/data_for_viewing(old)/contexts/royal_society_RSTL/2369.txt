takes place when cold rods are placed in a tall receiyer partially exhausted.

Exv. VI. Place two metallic wires in the ends of a long pencil of flame formed
by the blowpipe, connect them with the opposite sides of a charged jar, and
the jar will be discharged by explosion along the flame. The spark will make
its appearance at the point of the flame. The flame of a blowpipe is a hollow
cone containing highly rarified air. The electric fluid will therefore glide
along such a cone, exactly as it does along the interior of a hollow cone of
glass partially exhausted of air. We are therefore not to regard flame as a con-
ductor of electricity in the ordinary sense of the term ; when the only part it
performs in the conduction is merely that of forming a partial vacuum.

This fact is sometimes illustrated in a magnificent manner during violent
irruptions of volcanic mountains. The air in the crater is highly rarified : and
during a thunder-storm, the lightning is observed to dart into the hollow
cone as if it were attracted by the flame, or by the mass of melted lava at the
bottom of the crater; whereas the true cause of the phaxnomenon. is found in the
ready passage which the partial vacuum affords to the electric fluid driven off
by its own repulsion from the charged cloud.

It is a well-known fact that imperfect conductors become tolerably good
conductors when heated. Glass, for example, which is a very imperfect con-
ductor when cold, conducts the electric fluid very readily when heated red hot.
This is indeed what we might naturally expect from what we have assigned
as the cause of conduction. Glass when cold has a powerful attraction for the
