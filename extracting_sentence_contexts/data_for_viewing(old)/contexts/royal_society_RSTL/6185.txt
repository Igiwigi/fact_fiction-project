2 It may be doubted whether the above investigation is.strictly applicable to the whole
DSf the heat which emanates from the heated surface or to that part only which may
EM conceived to radiate through the air to the bottom of the calorimeter, in contra-
Yistinetion to that which must be borne away by the air from the heated surface by con-
Joction or conduction. As the effect, however, produced on the narrow annulus must be
:Sf the same kind, there is probably little error in the correction, by supposing it of the
Zame magnitude.

11. There is another error, which would seem perhaps to be inherent in any experi-
-Znental determination of the quantity of heat radiating from one surface and falling on
Another. It arises from the fact of one of these surfaces (as the base of the calorimeter
31 my experiments, and the internal surface of the surrounding globe in those of DU-
3-086 and PerIT) not being perfectly absorbent, as assumed in the reults, which ought,
Iherefore, in the following experiments, to be increased in the proportion which the heat
Feflected from the blackened surface of the calorimeter bears to the heat absorbed by it.
This ratio is probably very small, but T am not aware of any attempt to determine it.

S Numerous experiments were made before the calorimeter assumed exactly the form
=ahl described; for it was only by a careful observation of the anomalies presented by
he earlier experiments that I became fully aware of the importance which attached to
ifferent points in the construction of the instrument, and the mode of conducting the
experiments. I shall give a few of the later experiments, on which some of my prin-
cipal results are founded, in full detail, to enable the reader the better to judge of the
