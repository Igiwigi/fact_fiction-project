Given a
random (intermittent) process v(t), one can study P[tÂ»,L] as a function of the time at which
v(t) is larger than some level L. In the case discussed in this paper, P[tw,L] does not show any
scale invariance. In fact, upon changing L, we are also changing our definition of event size. Our
approach, following [6], is to fix the definition of event and then disregard it in the computation
of tw events of size larger than some threshold S,: we are looking at some longer time for the
same set of events. One may argue that this is a minor detail, but we have clearly shown that this
is not the case in our system and we argue the same is true for other physical systems.
