For example, we are happy to use noun phrases like the first [fg

to any real entity. These arguments are not even limited to abstract or hypothetical concepts.
[80] studied children’s understanding of the concept raccoon and revealed that no perceptual,
functional, or in any way observable properties appeared to alter beliefs about what makes a
raccoon a raccoon, leading to the conclusion that the meaning of raccoon is some unobservable
‘essence’. [81] Thus argue that many such common concepts are embedded in theories and that
their meaning is derived from the role they play in those theories. Within CRS, one can argue
that in fact all words acquire their meaning in the same way. Under such a theory, the question of
whether LLMs encode meaning depends on the structure of the concepts they encode internally,
and the relationship between those concepts. The above argument might be considered an internalist account, in which meaning depends
only on the structure of the internal representations.
