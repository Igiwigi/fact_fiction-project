The duration
of pregnancy at 30°C is not precisely known, but as puparia are occasionally
deposited on the 13th day of the female’s life, we estimate it at 12 days or a little less
(p. 189). If one pregnancy immediately succeeds another in all females, and if the
duration is 12 days, the standarized birth-rate would be 8-33. But, in fact, we
obtained 2-85, the mean of three cages which varied between 7-10 and 1-58,
Table V. It seems, therefore, that under our best conditions, the births are about
one-third of what might be expected. The figures for Glossina submorsitans are not
essentially different, and one notes that Porrs, working with morsitans at Kikori,
Tanganyika, obtained birth-rates of two or a little over (Porrs, 1933, p. 294, para. a).
