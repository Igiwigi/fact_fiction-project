CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IN VERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 945

surround a central vacant space. In addition to these fibres there are also a few cells
scattered throughout the layer ; they rezemble the largest sized cells of the fourth
layer, but are on an average of Slightly larger dimensions ; sometimes they have three
processes, one of which can be traced for some distance into the complex of fibres
forming the exit of the nerve. The sixth layer is formed of finely granular material
resembling that of the third layer ; i occupies the anterior end of the tuberculum,
and forms a sort of kernel round which the other layers are placed.

We have now described those parts of the brain of Mormyrus which differ from, and
are in fact additions to, the nervous centres of an ordinary Teleostean ; the remaining
portions show very slight variations from the general plan.

The Central Cavities.

In tracing the central canal of the spinal cord and its prolongations forward, it is to
be remarked that the cavities show a tendency to contraction and almost obliteration.
At a very shorb distance in front of the point where the central canal of the spinal
d cord merges into the fourth ventricle, this latter cavity (fig. 10) becomes plugged with
S a mass of finely granular material, which in the central line shows indications of its
S original separation into two halves ; this contains part of the ganglion of the vagus.
Farther forward this ventricle exhibits an extremely deep narrow fissure (fig. 9), which
owes its depth and narrowness to the great development of the vagal tuberosities. At a
