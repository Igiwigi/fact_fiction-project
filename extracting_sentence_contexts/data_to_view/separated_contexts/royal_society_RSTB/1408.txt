In some cases, a radial section passes through a canal so as to show its
at anode. Here it is clear that the protoxylem in the internodal canal is co
with the innermost elements of the nodal xylem. ‘This point is illustrated in
fig. 10. In no case, except where the preservation is bad, has a canal been ex

From these observations we conclude: that the internodal canals of C
represent the earliest-formed xylem of the primary vascular bundles ;
primitive wood became disorganized and ruptured, owing to the longitudi
transverse extension of the growing internode ; and that the formation of |
was due to a tearing of the tissue caused by the presence of a strand of ines
lignified elements among the actively-growing parenchymatous cells,
