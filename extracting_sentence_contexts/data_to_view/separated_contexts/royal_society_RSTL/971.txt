means of putting this remarkable; consequence- to the test
of experiment. In fact, in the three series of tints observed
in sulphate of baryta, the apparent angles between the axes
for the mean red rays are respectively 62? of, 62% 2/, and 61*
53', the mean of which-is 61* g8', while the apparent angles
between the virtual poles in the same series are 72% 46', 729
36', and 72*47%. The semi-excesses of the latter angles over
the mean value of the former, are the apparent angular
distances of the virtual poles from the axes of mean red rays,
and are respectively 5* 24/, 5?19', 5* 25, neither of which
differs more than 4/ from the mean.
