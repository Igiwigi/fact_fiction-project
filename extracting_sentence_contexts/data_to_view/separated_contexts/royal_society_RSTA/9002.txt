Looking at the result in a somewhat different way, if for instance we imagined the
gaseous ions to be the scattering units and calculated the number necessary in order
to produce the scattering experimentally observed, we should find a number some
millions of times the total number of molecules present in the scattering substance,
that is, a number probably trillions of times too many, Yet applied to determine the
number of electrons, the theory gives the number now accepted, certainly within a
possible 5 to 10 per cent. error. The theory on which this is based is the spreading wave theory. It assumes that
the scattered radiation is the radiation resulting from the. disturbance in electrons
while under the influence of—in fact while controlled by{—the primary radiation. Thus every electron in the matter traversed is influenced by every wave in the
primary radiation passing over it, and receives a definite acceleration, f say, which
is proportional to the electric intensity in the primary beam. The rate of’ radiation

of energy from an electron with charge e and acceleration f is 3ue?f?/V—as first shown
by Larmor.
