Let the glacier be here forsaken, and let the flanking mountain
side, either right or left, be ascended, until a pPosition is attained which affords a com-
plete view of the fall and of the glacier stretching downwards from the base of the fall. The view from such a position will furnish a key to the development of the transverse
structure. It is, in point of fact, a grand experiment which Nature here swbmits to our inspec-
tion. The glacier, descending from its n6v6, reaches the swmmit of the fall and is
broken transversely as it crosses the brow. It. descends the fall as a succession of
broken cliffy ridges, with transverse hollows between them.
