cally. The ordinates are the intensities of light of the large aperture. These are
derived from the value of diminution of the light falling on the ground glass, together
with the reduction due to the sectors. â€˜The latter is converted into the degrees of the
annulus and added to that by which the light has been diminished before falling on the
plate. The abscissee show the values of the reduction of the light on the smaller
aperture. Both the annular values are shown as logarithms. Again, the resulting
curve is for a large part of its length a straight line. Each aperture has its own

iy readings with large aperture (94%)

inclination and is determined by the extinction values of the two apertures. In making
these determinations the eye has to judge the brightness of very dissimilar sizes of area,
andit might be thought that this fact would present an almost insuperable difficulty in
making very accurate measures. As a matter of fact, it was not so; the greatest
difficulty was encountered in those cases when the light of the large aperture was so
diminished that it became colourless, whilst the other had very nearly its original tint.
The red was perhaps the hardest to judge on that account; the other colours did not-pre-
sent any great difficulty. One of the curious phenomena encountered in these measures
at times was a distinct scintillation of the light emitted by the small aperture. Some-
times this was perplexing, but never to the extent to render the comparisons uncertain,
