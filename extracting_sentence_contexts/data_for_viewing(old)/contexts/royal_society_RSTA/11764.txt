purely magnetic system, @.e., one in which F = 0, so that a charged particle moving
with the system experiences no force. The velocity of this system will be supposed
to be w parallel to the axis of «. The moving charge q is supposed to have a velocity
w, whose components are 1, #, ws. Then, if P denote the mechanical force on g, we
have, by (65),

But the state of the field must be determined experimentally by estimating the
force on a unit magnetic pole, which we shall suppose is moving with the magnetic
system. ‘This is exactly what we find when we make experiments to find the intensity
of any magnetic field by means of a magnet, for this field and the magnet are both
carried along by the rapid motion of the Earth. It is, in fact, R which we measure,
and not H. We must, therefore, determine E and H in terms of R, the only quantity
which we can observe. This has already been done in equations (76) and (77), where
we have now to put F = 0, so that,

E, = 0, E, =£ Rs, E; = - os Ry

Expanding P into its three components and substituting the above values of EB and
H, we find
