175 = 2484(3 = 146). Hence the K.R. line 3688 is the collateral D,,(4)(—179), and
apparently the small intensity is due to the usual decrease produced by a negative
lateral displacement. The modified table is taken on ¢ = —‘08. It is remarkable
how close the observed differences come to multiples, but little reliance must be
placed on deductions from them both on account of the large possible errors and the
smallness of 4.

Ag.

Unfortunately the D series in Silver is poorly developed—only the first satellite
has been observed, and the three chief lines after the first have very large possible
observation errors. Nothing, therefore, can be learnt as to the march of the satellite
differences beyond the fact that the observed —2436—is very close to 23d, = 2421.
In the modified table ¢ = ‘1, the differences are very close as is seen to multiples of

6,, but there can be no certainty with such large possible errors.

Mg.

In the D series of Magnesium, as arranged by Kayser and Runer and as generally
accepted, there are clearly certain abnormalities. D,(4) is more intense than we
