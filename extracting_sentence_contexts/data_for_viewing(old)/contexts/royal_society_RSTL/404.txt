what they found by experience, to be the general amount of
the northern 'set.*

He goes on to say, that, in like manner, the safety of
ships, after they come into soundings, till they reach Scilly,
depended on their making no /ess allowance, than the Bristol
men do, in the other Channel. For, says he, © experience
* informs me, that from the commencement of soundings, in
« lat, 49* go'N. to the Tength of Scilly, in fair weather, I had
« found the northern indraught to be six- or eight miles in
« the twenty-four hours.”

Here then, the fact of the northern set, is a second time
recognised; though without any suspicion, any more than
before, of there being a westerly set, also.

Here it may be proper to state, what appears to me to be
a very important fact ; although perhaps, not connected with
the current in question ; but materially affecting the safety
of the navigation, between the British Channel and Dublin.
It was communicated to the Author, by Captain Evans, a
gentleman who superintends the harbour works at Holy-
head; and who has had much experience in the navigation
of the Irish sea.
