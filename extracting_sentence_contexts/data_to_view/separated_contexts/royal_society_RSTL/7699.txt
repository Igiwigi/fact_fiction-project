1 disregard altogether the ultimate division depending on the reality of the lines, attend-
ing only to the division into (twenty-two, or as I prefer to reckon it) twenty-three cases
depending on the nature of the singularities. And I attend to the question very much
on account of the light to be obtained in reference to the theory of Reciprocal Surfaces. 5 The memoir referred to furnishes in fact a store of materials for this purpose, inasmuch

as it gives (partially or completely developed) the equations in plane-coordinates of the
several cascs of cubic surfaces, or, what is the same thing, the equations in point-coor-
dinates of the several surfaces (orders 12 to 3) reciprocal to these repectively. I found
by examination of the several cases, that an extension was required of Dr. SALMON's
theory of Reciprocal Surfaces in order to make it applicable to the present subject ; and
the preceding © Memoir on the Theory of Reciprocal Surfaces ” was written in connexion
with these inyestigations on Cubic Surfaces. The latter part of the Memoir is divided
into sections headed thus —* Section I=12, equation (X, Y, Z, WY'=0 ” &c. referring
to the seyeral cases of the cubic surface; but the paragraphs are numbered continuously
through the Memoir.
