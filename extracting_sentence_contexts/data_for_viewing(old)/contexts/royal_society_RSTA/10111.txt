§ 40. We have therefore obtained the nature of the asymptotic expansion of f(«)
for the two cases when 3% («) > 0 and when 3% (x) < 0.
The integral which was employed in § 35 showed us that in the latter case | f(a) |
when || is very large is of order less than the order of |(—«)~*| || when e > 0.
We readily see that this is in agreement with the preceding result,

The investigation just concluded has emphasised the fact that the asymptotic
expansion of the more general function considered at the beginning of this Part of
the memoir demands, when %(«) <0, a knowledge of the nature of the finite
singularities of y ().
