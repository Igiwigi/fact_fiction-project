CHERRY ON PERIODIC SOLUTIONS OF

is periodic and of parameter oc, i.e., if the %, u are Laurent series in e”, the latter
solution is manifestly of the same nature ; in particular, to an equilibrium solution for
the z, u, corresponds for the a, y such a periodic solution. Similarly to a periodic
solution of parameter o/m (m integral) for the 2, «4, corresponds for the x, y a periodic
solution of the same parameter. The fact that z,, «4, ¢ are only involved in K through
the composite arguments v, w, w’ will enable us to find periodic solutions of (5.21), and
therefore of (5.1), and the fact that in (5.20) o is an arbitrary parameter will enable us to
find continuous families of such solutions of continuously varying parameter. Suppose

the corresponding solution of (5.1). We form the variational equations of these solutions
by substituting in (5.21), (5.1), respectively—

y% = P+ 2, hi= Q + ye

If we make these substitutions in (5.20) we obtain to the first order the 2’,, y’, as
homogeneous linear functions of the z’,, w’,, with periodic coefficients (parameter o/m),
whence from any solution for the z’,, u’, we can derive the corresponding solution for the
v',, y'» If p is an exponent of (5.30) there is a solution for the 2’, u’, of the form

and

2',, uw’, = e X (periodic function of ¢ of parameter o/m),

and the corresponding solution for the a’, y’, has evidently the same form with the
same value of ».
