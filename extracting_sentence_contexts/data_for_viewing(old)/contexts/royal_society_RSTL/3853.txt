legs on the left side had been cut close off, but the basilar joints in these were elongated,
and the insect cast its skin without difficulty. In the fifth specimen, which cast its
skin during the very moment I was examining it, the facts were still more satisfac-
tory. The middle leg on the left side had been removed, but the basilar joint, as in
the other instances, had become elongated. Besides this, a portion of the posterior
leg on the same side had been removed at the tibial joint, and this had now been re-
produced with the tarsus and claw. Tt now formed a short leg, very obtuse at its
extremity, with the minute black claw sunk in its apex. This fact sufficiently proved
to me that a power of reproduction exists in insects which undergo a complete meta-
morphosis, as well as in those which do not change their form, and it led me to watch
with greater assiduity the passing of these individuals into the pupa state.

At the expiration of nine days from the commencement of the experiments (June
1st), one of the larve, that was nearly full-grown when operated on, snspended itself
to enter the pupa state. At that time there were only seventeen specimens $till living
out of the twenty-eight originally employed, and four of these died soon after. There
then remained two of the oldest, six of the next age, and, as above stated, five of the
youngest. The eight oldest specimens had all changed to pupz by the 5th of June;
but the remaining five continued to feed until the 6th, between which and the 9th,
the seventeenth day after the operation, these also had become pupze. I was now
