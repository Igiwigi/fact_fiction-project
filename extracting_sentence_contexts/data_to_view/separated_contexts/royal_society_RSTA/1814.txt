Zel’dovich’s proposal [10] thus connects the cosmological constant to a range of
completely different phenomena, which would give great strength to his theory. Unfortunately,
while Zel’dovich derived the correct structure of the cosmological term, the predicted quantitative
value for A is in stark disagreement with the facts. The facts are that the universe is indeed dominated by vacuum fluctuations, simply because
it is rather empty, and that the spectrum of these fluctuations is almost unlimited, because of the
equivalence principle of general relativity [2]. The emptiness of space is quantified in the number
for the average mass density of space on cosmological scales at the present time:

The equivalence principle [2] states that gravity acts equally on all bodies and on all scales. In
particular, it implies that gravity acts equally on all fields on all wavelengths, down to the Planck
scale where—presumably—classical general relativity [2] no longer holds.
