Savestigation of variations in the spectrum, the question is complicated by differences
eh sensitive films, and in the case of a silver-on-glass reflector by the conditions of
athe mirrors. My own experience has shown that when mirrors are tarnished, the
“Altra-violet portion of the spectrum is weakened in greater proportion than the violet
3nd blue.

One of the most striking variations previously recorded is that of the strong line
Ba the ultra-violet near \ 373. This was the strongest line in the photograph taken
ey Dr. Hueerns in March, 1882,* but it was not shown in Dr. Draper’s photograph
Baken i in the same year.t
% Dr. Draper says: “I have not found the line at 3730, of which he (Dr. Huaarys)
Speaks, though I have other lines which he does not appear to have photographed.
"his may be due to the fact that he had placed his slit on a different region of the
‘nebula, or to his employment of a reflector and Iceland spar prism, or to the use of a
glifferent sensitive preparation. Nevertheless, my reference spectrum extends beyond

he region in question.”
= A later photograph (1889), taken by Dr. Huaains,t did not show the line in
Ayuestion, the slit being placed on a different part of the nebula. As already stated,
the line is one of the strongest in my photographs, though it is not quite as strong as
Hy. The spectrum photographed by Dr. Hucerns, in 1889, differed entirely from
those photographed by him in 1882 and 1888, the slit being again placed on a
different region of the nebula.

My own photographs are specially interesting, as they indicate differences even in
