evident both that the spectrum of air is not formed by the mere 8uperpoxition of those : |
of N and O, and that certain electrodes can excite lines in a mixture of two gases which
are not visible in either of those gases taken separately, or cannot excite them in the
mixture, though they can in either or both of the components. This unexpected fact is
illustrated by an attempt which I made to obtain the lines of platinum, by comparing
its 8pectrum in mercury Vapour with that of mercury. I expected, as I had done in the
cages already mentioned of gases with Hyg electrodes, that I should get the spectrum of
Pt+that of Hg; but the result was otherwise. Hg Hg had forty-eight lines, Pt Hg only
twenty-five, s0 that the presence of Pt instead of Hg as electrodes put out twenty-three.
It however brought out four new ones, of which No. 15 7 is found with every solid metal,
Nos.33, 59 x”, and 76 £ with most of them. There is here no superposition, but, instead,
either an antagonism of platimum and mercury, or the curious fact that the fluid elec-
trodes act differently from the solid. It would be interesting to compare the. spectra of
tin in these two states.

The case is the same with a chemical compound as with a mixture. On the prin-
