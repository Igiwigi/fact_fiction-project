Suppose the Sun’s mass to be concentrated from infinite dispersion until it is
arranged in the form of a homogeneous sphere of radius @ and density p. Then let
the sphere be cut up into as many equal spaces as there are meteorites, and let the
matter in each space be concentrated into a meteorite. When the number of
meteorites is large, the potential energy lost in the first process is very great compared
with that lost in the subsequent partial condensation into meteorites.* Thus, the
energy lost in the partial condensation is negligible.

* It depends, in fact, on the square of the ratio of the diameter 2a to the linear dimersion of one of
the equal spaces.

If » be'the attractional constant, the lost energy of condensation is well known to
be $4M,2/a.
