ON THE MAMMALIAN NERVOUS SYSTEM. 427

in order to avoid cooling, &c., and only taken out of its muscular bed for purposes of
excitation. The large resting electromotive difference between the surface and cross
section of the cord having been balanced, an excitatory electrical effect in the opposite
Jirection to the difference was observed to accompany the stimulation of the nerve.
The amount of this effect, as indicated by the amount of the galvanometric excursion,
varied, as previously stated, not merely with the intensity and the duration of the
stimulus, but with the condition of anzesthesia, &c., of the animal. If care be taken
io keep these factors as far as possible unchanged, the excitatory electrical effect thus
produced at each repetition of the experiment keeps very fairly uniform, as much so
point of fact as in similar experiments upon Mammalian nerve trunks. When we
aH thus obtained a constant effect in the cord, an intervening section was made in
HB lower dorsal or upper lumbar region by the method described in Chapter III.,
F tion 2. Its position coincided, in some cases, with the lowest portion of the part
Bthe dorsal cord exposed for connection with the galvanometric electrodes, in the
@Bjority of cases with a still lower level obtained by a fresh exposure of a small
partion of cord. It was found that it was not desirable to make this second exposure
viten the cord was first prepared, since during the time lost in the preliminary experi-
rit, &c., the intervening cord at this point is apt to suffer.
â€œathe intervening section having been thus made, the nerve was excited under
p&cisely the same conditions as before, and the alteration, if any, in the amount of
les cord effect noted. In all such experiments the extent of the section of the cord,
val thus the part involved in the interruption, is capable of great variation, and the
