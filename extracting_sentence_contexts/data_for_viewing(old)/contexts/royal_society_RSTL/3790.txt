remarkable change in the relative position of their spiral threads. If figs. 40, 41 be
referred to, it will be seen that « of fig. 40 passes into « of fig. 41, and the latter into
Þ of the same figure. The scheme fig. 60 may illustrate this transition. This scheme
is merely an altered state of that in fig. 55. In each there are two spirals ; the dif-
ference consisting in the relative position of the spirals. The points in contact at «
fig. 55, have separated in fig. 60 (z, «) ; $0 that now, a transverse section is no longer
represented by the figure 8 (par. 14), but by a circle. This latter (fig. 60) seems
to exhibit the relative poxsition of the spirals, in some instances, when they begin to
form, as will be hereafter shown, the membrane of a tube. Such appears to be their
state in fig. 41. Þ: a $state which apparently precedes the formation of the tubes in
figs. 42, 43, and the subsequent figures in this Plate.

Facts observed in the Formation and Structure of Nerve.

28. It is known that in the 80-called © primitive fibres” into which a nerve can be
Separated by means of needles, Remax demonstrated a © band-like axis,” corre-
sponding to the © eylindrical axis of Purkivas%;” and that the 8nbstance surround-
ing this axis, has been termed by Scawaxy, the © white substance of the nervous
fibre.” This * white substance” I find to consist of filaments (fig. 112 «, Þ—fig.
