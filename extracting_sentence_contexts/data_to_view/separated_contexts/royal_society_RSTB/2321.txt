We specially investigated one of these products, namely, choline, which
is derived from the breakdown of lecithin ; but we also noted that there are others, for
instance, nucleo-proteid. Choline can be identified in the blood also of these patients,
The tests on which we rely for the detection of this alkaloid are mainly two: the first
is a chemical test, namely, the obtaining of the typical yellow octahedral crystals from
the alcoholic extract of the blood. These crystals have not only a definite form, but
their solubilities distinguish them from other somewhat similar crystals, as also does
the fact that they yield a fixed percentage of platinum, and give rise to an odour of
trimethylamine when decomposed by heat. The second test is a physiological one: a
saline solution of choline, of choline hydrochloride, and of the residue obtained from

the alcoholic extract of the cerebro-spinal fluid, and blood of these patients, produce a

temporary fall of pressure when injected intravenously in animals. This fall is partly

cardiac in origin, and partly due to dilatation of peripheral blood-vessels; the

dilatation is due to the direct action of the alkaloid on the neuro-muscular mechanism

of the blood-vessels themselves, There are many substances which produce a fall of
arterial pressure, but choline is peculiar in the fact that after the administration of a

small dose of atropine subcutaneously, it no longer produces a fall but a rise of blood

pressure, or, at any rate, the fall is abolished.
