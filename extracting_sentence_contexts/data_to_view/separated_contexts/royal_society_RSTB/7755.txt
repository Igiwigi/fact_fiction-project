It has also been argued that because tropical tree
carbohydrate concentrations, [CH,O], are ‘generally
high’, [CH,O] must already be in excess with
increasing [CO,] unable to further stimulate plant
growth (Korner 2003; Wright 2005). That plants
growing under elevated [CO,] often have higher
[CH2O] has also been taken as additional evidence
for this idea (Korner 2003). Nevertheless, recent
advances in our understanding of the signalling of
growth responses in plants, in particular interactions
between sugar and plant hormone signalling with
nutrients and other growth limitations (Rolland er al.
2006), show that higher [CH,O] is, in fact, usually
associated with a stimulation of sink activity (i.e. faster

Although an increased [CO] accompanying climate (CH2O] with higher [CO2] do not mean that plant
change should more than offset any detrimental effects growth is not ‘carbon’ limited (Masle et al. 1990) and
of higher temperatures and increased D on tropical sugar signalling provides a simple explanation for why
forest productivity, this does not necessarily mean that increased [CO,] usually causing increases in both
increasing [CO,] should also be serving to stimulate [CHO] and Np.
