As noted, a NASA statement of principles for the Artemis
Accords provides for creating ‘safety zones’ that could entail such restrictions [48]. The potential
for disputes is aggravated by the fact that no forum exists for the ‘appropriate consultations’
between parties facing interference called for in Article XII of the OST. Efforts to address such
eventualities are more likely to succeed if they are pursued before new “facts on the ground” are
established.


4. Policy considerations

Means of managing these challenges at lunar sites of interest are suggested by coordination and
governance mechanisms developed to address similar problems in other settings, most of them
terrestrial. From the perspective of policy studies, lunar sites of interest present analogues to
global ‘common-pool resources’ or ‘commons’ [63,64].
