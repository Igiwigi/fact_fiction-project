MANsour,
on the other hand, just as clearly shows stomodéeal and proctodeal (therefore ectodermal)
origin of the mid-gut. It would be ridiculous to assume from this that the mid-guts of
the two subjects for investigation quoted are not homologous structures, and yet that
is the conclusion to which we are driven if we accept each author’s view and attempt
to keep rigidly to the germ-layer theory. The explanation seems to lie in the fact that in different types of insect embryos, the
anlagen of the mid-gut arise at different times relative to the stomodzeum and proctodzeum. This view, clearly expounded by Nuspaum and Futinskr (1909) is that there are no
fewer than seven different ways in which the mid-gut develops, only differing from one
another in the earliness or lateness of development as compared with the development
of the stomodeum and proctodeeum. ‘The following is a summary taken from NuspauM
and Furinsktr (1909) :—

Type I.—Endoderm rudiments are first cut off from the germ band. This is followed
by the invagination of stomodeeum and proctodwum carrying the endoderm
into the yolk.
