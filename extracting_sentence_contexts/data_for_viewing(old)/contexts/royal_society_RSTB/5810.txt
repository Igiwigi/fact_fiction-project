can be traced on other photographs along the line shown in fig. 11, p. 350, as “ air
channel,” until it is lost under the buildings, but if it did not bend much in the next
100 m., it should pass directly under the site of this very permeable bore-hole at 360¢,
thus accounting for its permeability.

We have some reason to think that the main water outflow is to the north of the
impermeable mass round 500e. It is tempting to assume that this is accounted for by
another old channel, also shown on fig. 11 as “ Napoleon’s channel.” Its position in
this figure is a transcript from the map of Cairo district compiled by the savants of
Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt, or rather, from a reprint of that map superposed on
the modern map of Cairo, published by the Survey Department. It is hardly likely
that the location of the four or five channels which this map shows in the cultivated
land should be exact, but the fact remains that one of them does cross the map of our
farm in a most suitable position to account for the line of free underground movement
of water in accordance with our observations.

From the examination of this line of 75 bores it is concluded that 13 are completely
impermeable and one excessively permeable, that at least 20 are obviously in contact
with the canals and many more may be, while a dozen or so would seem to be of the
backwater type.

From this base line we next extend as far as possible over the remainder of the farm,
by means of 70 bores put down at 65 m. intervals on a grid of rectangular co-ordinates,
one to each acre, as shown in fig. 12, p. 350. Several of these gave no readings, notably
around 100n-500e, where the surface soil was sandy and choked the holes. It seems
