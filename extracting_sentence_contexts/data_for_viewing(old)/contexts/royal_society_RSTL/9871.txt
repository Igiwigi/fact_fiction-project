Then we should have

G= am[ 1420021029]
D= 4 [1=20=9+$(1—9(1=29]

The last term in each of these expressions involves a small factor both in numerator
and denominator, viz. : 1—2X because A=+ nearly, and p, because the viscosity is
large. The evaluation of these terms depends on the actual degree of viscosity, but
all that we are now concerned with is the fact that when X=4& the true physical result
is that D changes sign by passing through zero and not infinity, and that G does the
game for some value of X not far removed from 4.

Now consider the function BUD
spectively, and when it is said that 7 or j increase or decrease, it is meant increase or
decrease as t or E increases.

(i.) From X=1 to X=5 the function is negative.

Hence for these values of X the inclination j decreases, or zero inclination is
dynamically stable.
