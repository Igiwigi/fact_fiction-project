This is a known result, or immediately deducible from known results*, since the
system of images of the vortex in the planes _y = + 4 form two collinear rows of
vortices of strengths x and —«. It is, however, easy to verify directly that (4.1)
gives a motion satisfying the following conditions :—

(i) The motion is without expansion and irrotational except for z = Z, : this follows from
the fact that wu — i is an analytic function of z for any point z between the planes
y= + db except z= %.

(ii) The circulation in a circuit surrounding z, is x: this is seen from the fact that for
such a circuit

(iii) v = 0 for» = + 6: this follows from the fact that in general
