FORMATION OF THE CORPUS LUTEUM IN THE SHEEP. 7

remarked, there is no definite time during cestrus at which ovulation occurs, while an
oestrous period may extend over several hours, Consequently two recently discharged
follicles, although of the same age, according to the method of reckoning, may
present slightly different degrees of development. *

I proceed to describe the stages which I have obtained in the formation of the
sheep's corpus luteum, When coition was known to have taken place, the fact is
recorded. The corpus luteum obtained from an animal killedâ€™ seven hows after coition differs
from the unburst follicle in its size and in the fact that the ovum and discus
proligerus have been discharged.
