The view which the author has been led to as the result of the foregoing experi-
ments is that the positive, as well as the negative, ions are produced in the first
instance inside the metal, or, at any rate, so far within the surface that their rate of
production is in general uninfluenced by the external field. The experiments, in
addition, afford strong support to the view that the positive ions are furnished not by
the platinum itself, but by the oxygen absorbed or dissolved in the transition layer
between the metal and the surrounding gas. That the positive ions do not arise in
the space outside the free metal surface appears to be distinetly indicated by the
following considerations.

We have seen that the positive and negative ionisations from hot platinum vary
with the temperature according to the same kind of law, but quite independently of
one another. This is exemplified by the fact that at a pressure of 1°5 millims. of
oxygen the two leaks are equal to one another at about 1230° C., whereas at 700° C.
the saturation current with the wire negative is about 1077 of its value with the wire
positive. The disparity between the two leaks points strongly to the view that they
are the result of separate actions; it proves, in addition, that there is no considerable
amount of volume ionisation, but it does not prove that the ions are not formed
outside the wire. For instance, an oxygen molecule might attack a positively-
charged platinum atom, with the result that of the two oxygen atoms present in the
molecule the one carrying the negative charge combined with the platinum, whilst
the other one was set free, forming a positive ion. Of course, the negative ion would
in a sense be free while the interaction was taking place, but it would always be
within a distance from the attracting positive ion comparable with the radius of the
sphere of molecular action, and the interionic attraction would probably be enormous
