of this we notice the pronounced easterly dip of the beds, which, as suggested by Brak
and Huprrston, is probably false dip, such as may be seen in the corresponding beds
at Headington, and forms such a remarkable feature in the lower Osmington Oolite at
Todber, Dorset. ‘These authors further remark, “ We are here presented with the
deposits which were formed on the extreme edge, not only of the coral reef, whose thickness
would not account for so much false dip (which amounts in the most easterly quarry
to 12°, and is even marked 18° at another spot on the map), but probably of the Lower
Caleareous Grit sandbank also—a conclusion which is supported by the fact of its sudden
termination eastwards.” [6, p. 311].

In the northern part of the northern quarry at Wheatley the weathering of a portion
of the face fallen into disuse has revealed a significant fact. Here, between the heights
of about 10 and 20 ft. below the “ Pendle,” the softer bands are seen to have a distinctly
rubbly and nodular structure, which makes them indistinguishable from the curious
“ Nodular Rubble ” of Headington, about to be described, which can be demonstrated
to pass laterally into the Coral Rag.*

We will now return to the coral islands of Headington and follow the passage of the
Rag northwards into two other types of detrital deposit, the ‘‘ Nodular Rubble ” and the
“Pendle.” Three hundred yards north of the Windmill Quarry lies the large quarry
