BOTRYTIS CINEREA WITH COLOURLESS SCLEROTIA. 99

D. Sclerotial Formation.

It will be evident from text-fig. 1 that the sclerotium consists of a mass of more or
less firm tissue, enclosed in a thin layer of cells, in the walls of which the black
pigment is located. Now, unless the sclerotium arises in a single hyphal cell, in
which the variation may have occurred, the physiological change resulting in loss of
colour must have taken place simultaneously in all those peripheral cells which
normally would form pigment. In view of the fact that the new character is strictly
hereditary, and obtains by the growth of any portion of a single individual, and that
the initial colourless sclerotium arose in a tube culture containing a perfectly normal
growth, such a deep-seated physiological change occurring simultaneously in a very
great number of cells, and to an identical degree in all, is a process extremely difficult
to conceive.

Very little is known of the initial developmental stages in the formation of
sclerotia, but the latter are usually considered to be a further growth or modification
of haptera, structures which are very accurately delineated in the works of
MarsHaLt Warp (80) and Istvanrri (33). In their formation one, or more usually
several related hyphe form short branches on which arise tufts of secondary branches.
These are directed vertically to the contact surface, and the clustered hyphe mat
