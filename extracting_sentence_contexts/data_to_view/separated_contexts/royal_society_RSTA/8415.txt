The surface density on the other side—the side on which the charge H les—is the
sum of this value and the ordinary value on an infinite plane due to the charge and its
image, by our result of the last section. It does not seem necessary, as the two surface
densities are themselves well known from the work of Kexvxry, to prove that our formula
— 2E/= cot~? c/a is again obtained by integrating the total charge. We may, in fact,
at this point take leave of the present problem as an illustration of our analysis.

§20. Relation between Aperture and Dise Problems in Hlectrostatics and Hydrodynamics. The considerations advanced briefly in this section are not new, being in fact contained,
implicitly at least, in several papers on wave motion by Lord RaytetcH.
