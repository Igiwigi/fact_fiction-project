Were it a broad band having the same
total amount of light, it would be invisible in the spectroscope; it has probably there-

with the more correctly adjusted instrument go, is the same as that of those in C and P.

I am aware that the conditions as to density cannot for one moment be held to be the
same in the two cases; but
