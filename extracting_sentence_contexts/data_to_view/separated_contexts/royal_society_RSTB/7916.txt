Except the area of the sub-anal fasciole, all the characters in the two species overlap
in their ranges of variation. This is explained by assuming that they, like some recent
echinoids, interbred to some extent in nature. Certain of the evolutionary implications
of this fact will be discussed below. Isomicraster was established by Lambert in 1901 as a subgenus of Muicraster. In this
description he did not nominate a subgenotype.
