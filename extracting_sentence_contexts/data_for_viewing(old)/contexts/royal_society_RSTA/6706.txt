existence of secondary extinction, it cannot be used for its exact measurement. In the
divergent beam method crystallites of slightly different orientations select the X-rays whose
wave-lengths and directions suit them, and give one composite absorption line as a result.
The accurate measurements of secondary extinction by a direct method would have to
prevent this by the use of a monochromatic and strictly parallel beam. Nevertheless, the
divergent-beam method can give much useful information about the texture of crystals.

3) Crystals of organic compounds

8 It has generally been supposed that for crystals of organic compounds primary extinction
‘§ almost negligible and secondary extinction unimportant; that is, that they are almost
‘Beally mosaic crystals. The fact that good divergent-beam photographs were obtained from
% number of such crystals showed that this assumption was unsound, and that secondary
‘extinction at least must be reckoned with, since it is by no means unimportant if it can give
lear absorption lines. When later it was found that some crystals of organic compounds gave
Sery poor divergent-beam photographs, it was difficult to decide a priori whether the absence
Sf a picture in these cases was due to the presence of primary extinction (perfect crystal) or
- the absence of secondary extinction (completely imperfect or mosaic crystal). Extended
periment showed that a wide variation existed. Three out of five crystals of oxalic acid
‘Mihydrate gave either no visible lines, or lines so faint as to be seen only with the greatest
‘Bifficulty; the fourth gave a picture of moderate contrast and the fifth an excellent one.
