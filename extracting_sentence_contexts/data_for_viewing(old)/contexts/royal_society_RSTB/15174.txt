associated with vesicle trafficking to EEs is RIN3 (Ras and
Rab interactor 3) [79]. When coupled with other AD endocy-
tic risk genes, particularly BIN1, it has been implicated in
both Af and tau pathology.

Rab GTPases play critical roles in endocytosis, but this
role is governed by guanine nucleotide binding modulated
by GEFs. The role of RIN3 in the recruitment of BIN1 to
the EE was first highlighted by Kajiho and colleagues in
