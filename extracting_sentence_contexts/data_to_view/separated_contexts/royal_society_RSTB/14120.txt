In the absence of factors influencing that the best predictors of cognitive abilities are absolute
male mating strategies, females would do best to live and brain size or neocortex ratio, rather than relative brain size
forage alone (in the company of their offspring) [4]. The [42,59,60,63,66,67,97]. The consistency of this pattern suggests
other is that living in large stable congregations (as opposed that absolute measures do in fact tell us something meaning-
to aggregations or fission-fusion structures) is demanding ful about cognition (or, alternatively, the motivation) to

across individuals with differing energy budgets and resource equivalent to the neocortex ratio in primates, strongly pre-
