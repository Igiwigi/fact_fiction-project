when no land-inhabiting air-breathing vertebrates existed.

The fresh-water fish of India are widely remote in systematic position from the
Dipnoi ; most of them retain the air-bladder (cf. text-fig. 1 B, p. 189) which corresponds
to the organ with which the Dipnoi breathe air, but they do not use the air-bladder for
this purpose. The organs which these fish employ for air-breathing are new develop-
ments, which differ from genus to genus, and represent so many independent successful
solutions of the problem how to pass from an aquatic to an aerial mode of existence.

As the conditions under which this problem arises and is solyed are of fundamental
importance for our understanding of the evolutionary history of the Vertebrata, it seemed
to me that the close study of the habits and life-histories of certain of these fish might
throw valuable light on this question. A search through the literature revealed the fact
that although isolated observations existed, no systematic description of the habits of
any of these fish had been made; indeed, in some cases no accurate description of the
adult air-breathing organs was to be found, and in no case was anything known as to
their development.

My residence and early training in Allahabad (India) afforded me the opportunity of
studying several genera of these fish in their native environment. I selected for this
purpose six genera, viz., Anabas, Macropodus, Ophiocephalus, Clarias, Saccobranchus
and Amphipnous. Of these the first two belong to the same family (Anabantide) ;
they have air-breathing organs of the same structural type. Ophiocephalus is the so-
called “ Snake-headed ” fish, and has developed organs for breathing air which are
utterly different from those of the Anabantide. Clarias and Saccobranchus belong to
