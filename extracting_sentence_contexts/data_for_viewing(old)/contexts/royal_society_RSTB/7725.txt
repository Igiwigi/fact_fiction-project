It has been suggested that sexual maturation affects migration not only incidentally, in
the way just mentioned, but quite fundamentally, being its real cause. Uvarov (1928,
p. 86) wrote:

*.. physiological factors, which must be considered the real cause of flight. There can
be no doubt that the emigration flight is intimately connected with the process of develop-
ment of the genital products. An internal stimulus for the flight during the maturation of
genital products is prevalent in other insects, such as termites and ants, in which a so-called
nuptial flight precedes copulation; this is exactly what happens in locusts.’

This idea has found no place in Uvarov’s subsequent writings, but deserves mention because
it has been widely accepted, for instance by Imms (1937, p. 306), although it will not bear
examination in the light of the facts.

In undertaking migration, adults are merely resuming an activity which is no less
characteristic of the same insects as hoppers. Adults employ a more spectacular form of
locomotion, flight, when migrating, than do the hoppers which can only walk or hop. But
the behaviour of adult gregarious locusts is recognizable as migratory because of the
extraordinary persistency of their locomotion, not because of its particular form. The loco-
motory activity of hoppers is no less persistent, being interrupted only by moulting, given
favourable conditions. Adults resume migration while they are yet fledglings and continue
to migrate, with interruptions, when their sexual organs and behaviour are fully developed,
even until they die (p. 175 and Waloff 1946a, p. 63). In the normal course of events
