Finely-divided platinum, silver or carbon, decompose it, but far less rapidly
than those substances which are themselves also decomposed. I will not here discuss
the general chemical reactions of this peroxide, but defer their consideration until I
can treat with advantage, in a more exact manner, of the general theory of this action. The facts I have just mentioned gave a direction to my experiments, and instead
of the peroxide of hydrogen, the preparation and preservation of which involved
many difficulties, and with which it was inconvenient to work, I determined to use,
in the experiments I proposed, the peroxide of barium itself.

Before the stndy of these decompositions was possible, it was necessary to have
some ready and accurate method of determining the amount of oxygen in the various
preparations of the peroxide, which could never be obtained absolutely pure and cor-
responding to a theoretical formula, and of which I cannot indeed find that any satis-
factory analysis has yet been made. After various experiments I selected two methods, which combined the advantage
of great facility of execution with perfect agreement in their results.
