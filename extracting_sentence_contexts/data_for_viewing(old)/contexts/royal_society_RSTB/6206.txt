* Ifit is desired to convert weights of blood, as given in this paper, into volumes, they should be
divided by 1-06, the specific gravity of human blood.

Normal unfed flies

The preceding pages have been devoted to setting out a considerable body of fact.
The reader now possesses some knowledge of the limits of temperature and humidity
within which life is possible ; of the duration of life, of fed and unfed flies, under
defined conditions of climate ; and of the effect of climate on reproduction and on
feeding. We propose to study the physiological causes which may be supposed to
underlie these effects. But before further experiments are discussed, it is necessary
to establish the normal composition of flies which have not been subjected to
experimental treatment. The mean wet and dry weight will be required, and also
some knowledge of the variation about these means.

An attempt to establish a normal was made by taking flies known to be under 24
hours old and unfed, weighing them individually immediately after death, placing
them in numbered tubes at 100° C, and recording their dry weight when it ceased
