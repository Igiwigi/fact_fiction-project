And now, requesting my reader to pardon me for
a digression which some readers may consider uncalled for, I will proceed in the path
in which I hope to lead him with some satisfaction. Art. 3. In the equation L,=d. a. where L, signifies the number of persons living at
the age a, the letters d, g, qin my paper in the © Transactions' of 1825 express quantities
apparently nearly constant during a very long period of life—say, for instance, in the
Carlisle Table of Mortality between the ages 10 and 60; but if we commence our limit
at a different age, and terminate it at 8ome other far distant age, those quantities appa-
rently constant would haye different values of apparent constancy ; and here the pro-
duct d.g, which would appear in the equation by taking z=0, would be an arbitrary
quantity depending on the arbitrary value of Ly as a base, expressive of the arbitrary
number we intend to set out with as the persons living at the age 0; and if, which
is not the case accurately, the formula were universally true from birth to any other
age, d.q would express the number of persons born on which we intended the formula
to be constructed; for we should have L,=d.g; but as g is not arbitrary, 4 would be
the arbitrary quantity, and we might take d=1, if we did not object to fractions in the
number of the births, to set out with; and in that case the formula would stand

generally L,= a; if it were universally true from birth to any age; which, as I obseryed

above, it is not; and it is never in fact true if 9 and 7 are to be considered absolutel

constant ; as is evident from the example of the method I used in my investigation by
what I call the vital rule of three. And as the Table from which the data are to ;
obtained is moreover likely to contain irregularities, and undoubtedly does contain 8wch
which are not contained in the real law of mortality, it follows that if even the atadian

L=4; where @, 9, q are supposed to be constant, did exactly express the real law of
mortality, the values giyen to g and g by this vital rule of three would not be exactly
the same for every election, and therefore I should not have expected that any tolerable
mathematician in reading my paper could suppose that T meant to state that Thad given
their exact values. But wherever the three lives were selected, had the Table been accu-
rate from whence I selected the data, and were the law for constant values for d, 9,4
consistent throughout with the real lay of mortality, their respective values would have
come out the same.
