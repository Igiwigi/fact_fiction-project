The leat base is almost as great as
the whole diameter of the axis. The external appearance of the leaf, as is seen in
fig. 11, Plate 1 (magnified by two diameters), is quite similar to that of a pressed
specimen of Cryptomeria, Taiwama, or Araucaria, ~The shape of the leaf in
transverse section is seen in text-fig. 18 and Phot. 38, Plate 6. There is considerable
variety among the different leaf sections owing to the slightly varying directions in
which the sections were cut, and also to the fact that at the base the leaves appear to
have been more grooved (see Phot. 38), while they became more smoothly oval at the
tip (see Phot. 39). The Epidermis cells ave, like those of normal Gymnosperms, small celled with thick
outer walls.
z:.The Stomates are particularly well preserved and numerous. In surface view they
are seen in a number of leaves which are cut slightly obliquely.
