In the remaining six cases the mass gradually decreased in size and its outline became
progressively less definite. Subsequent histological examination showed disintegrating
splenic tissue with either no trace of thyroid (five cases) or a few thyroid acini embedded
in connective tissue (one case). The proportion of successful thyroid grafts was thus considerably higher than in the
previous experiment and, in fact, does not differ significantly from that found in experi-
ment I, 2 (i) (a) (uncomplicated thyroid homografts to the anterior chamber after total
thyroidectomy). Thus making this comparison we have 9 successes out of 15 as against 40 out of 51, for
which y?=2-16, P=0-15. The explanation of these results seems reasonably clear.
