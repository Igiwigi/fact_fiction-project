proportional to the probability of surviving till that age under
neutrality, /°, which can be thought of as the probability that
the effect of a mutant at age a is expressed and thus exposed
to selection (J? is in fact proportional to q°, the probability
that a resident individual is of age a; equation (B.36) in

nection). Since I} always decreases with a, selection tends to
be weaker on later acting than on early acting mutants [91]. This is always true for mutants affecting fecundity (b,(Zm, Z)).
