larva, and in many points of structural detail. This circumstance renders it probable that the
discrepancies between Goro’s account of internal development and mine are due to errors of
interpretation, on whichever side committed. At the same time 4. rubens and A. vulgaris are perfectly
distinct species, and are recognised as such by VERRILLt (91, p. 347), JEFFREY BELL (4, p. 496), and
SLADEN (87, pp. 816, 828).

Asterias forbesi,t Verrill (Desor), another American species, on the normal and experimental
embryology of which much work has been done by AGassiz (1), WILSON and MATHEWs (93), and others,
is also specifically distinct from 4. rubens, as may be seen from VERRILL’s description (91, pp. 345-6).

The main facts of its development bring A. rubens into much closer relationship
with the phanerozonate Asterina than with Cribrella and Solaster which like Asterias
are cryptozonate forms. This is notwithstanding the fact that in having large yolky
eggs and in the absence of pedicellarie, Asterina agrees rather with Cribrella and
Solaster than with Asterias rubens.

It may be added that Porania pulvillus, which is a phanerozonate form
belonging to the Gymnasteriade (87, xxxiii) a family not far removed from the
Asterinide, agrees with the cryptozonate A. rubens, in the principal details of its
larval history.

We are not yet in a position to throw much light from embryology on many of the difficult questions
of Asterid classification. New characters or groups of characters may have to be employed if a system
based on, or agreeing with, developmental data is to be elaborated. At the present time this seems to be
impossible ; nevertheless, for convenience in making comparisons it may be well to preface this paper with
