W is the water-bath,
in which is immersed the apparatus, of which A and K are the anode and cathode
cells respectively. R is a very large and easily varied resistance placed in circuit,
by means of which the voltage between A and K can be varied as required,

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. The independence of the margin velocity on the nature of the indicator, provided
the latter fulfils the required conditions shown by Masson, has been confirmed
by the measurement of magnesium sulphate with three pairs of indicators—copper
sulphate and potassium chromate, cadmium sulphate and sodium acetate, copper
sulphate and sodium acetate—and by the fact that practically the same result has
been obtained for the velocity of the hydrogen ion when measured with silver
nitrate or with potassium chloride as cation indicator. The negative case has been proved by a large number of experiments, all of which
show that, when the faster ion follows the slower, in cases where a boundary is
produced at all, the ratio of its velocity to that of the boundary at the opposite end
of the solution is quite inconstant. Table ITT.
