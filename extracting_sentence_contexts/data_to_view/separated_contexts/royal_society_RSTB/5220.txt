INTRODUCTION. The justification of the following research work is found in the fact that notwith-
standing the investigations of Remax (1851), GEGENBAUR (1862), JAcmR (1858), SoHwWARK
(1873), Braun (1881), Frortep (1883), Mannicu (1902), ScHavINsLAND (1905), and
Sontms (1907), which deal with the development of the vertebral column in birds, there
still remains a great deal of uncertainty in some essential questions regarding the
development of the membranous and cartilaginous components of the vertebra from
the mesenchymatous sclerotomes, as well as the morphological value of these com-
ponents. The most important of these undecided questions, to the solution of which
the present study tries to contribute, may be briefly summarised as follows: (a) what
is the exact genetic relation of the mesenchymatous sclerotomes and their derivatives
to the membranous and cartilaginous components of a developing vertebra with its
intervertebral parts, (b) what is the real nature of these components as regards their
number, quality and topographical relations to the neighbouring parts within the
