In making the developments the following abridged notation is adopted ; a term of
the form cos [(k+5)2+B—87] is written {k+8}. * Consider the series for Þ(s) firs. We have by successive applications of (269) with k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

In these expressions we have no right, as yet, to assume that {—2} and {—1} are
different from {2} and {1}; and in fact we shall find that in the expansion for ®(«)
they are different, but in that for R they are the same. Then adding up these, and rejecting terms of the third and fourth orders by the firs
rule of approximation, we have

Þ(«)=[(e")+(&®)+(e')]{23 +[(e)+(&)][ {13} +£33]+[(&)+(e9)]103+143]
+(e) {—1} +(){—Y

It will be observed that {5} and {6} are wanting, and might have been dropped
from the expansions.
