In the usual label approach to identical particles, the (anti)symmetrization implies that each of Dw
them has the same probability amplitude of occupying each single-particle state of the system. [om
This justifies Peres’s observation that ‘only one fermion can occupy a quantum state is a not :3
accurate statement’ [12]. [&

Other counterintuitive aspects with identical particles arise when one considers time- :
dependent problems. In fact, when a particle is created locally (LOCC processes) in a given
location, it instantaneously appears in a far away location provided that another identical labelled
particle is already present there. To make this point clear, we consider a helium atom 4He in the
state |Hep) on Earth and an ionized atom “He? in the state |HeX) plus an electron in the state |e,)
on the Andromeda galaxy (subscripts E and A representing the spatial localization of states on
Earth and Andromeda). Being at the beginning, all the involved particles are distinguishable, and
the global state is the tensor product |W-) = |He;) ® |Hex) ® lea). At the universal time t =0,
4He’ is scattered in “He and simultaneously ion 4Het on Andromeda absorbs the electron e,
forming the atom 4He (figure 1). At f=0* on Earth and on Andromeda, two identical bosons
appear in states |Heg) and |Hea). In the SA, the identical atoms were distinguished with labels

at t=0* each of the two helium atoms simultaneously occupies both states on E and A. This
