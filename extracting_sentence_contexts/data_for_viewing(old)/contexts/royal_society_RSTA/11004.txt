given by us in a previous paper (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ A, vol. 193, 1900, Plate 26, fig. 40).
In the present instance this method of detecting twins is not available, as the rough-
ness of the surface and the great depth of etching employed make it impossible to
study the slip-bands. But the presence of twin lamella nevertheless becomes evident
under slightly higher magnification with oblique light. Fig. 3, Plate 3, is a photo-
graph of crystals with twin lamelle magnified 40 diameters. The figure illustrates
the selective effect of oblique illumination, which has picked out a few isolated
erystals, lighting these brilliantly while neighbouring ones remain almost dark.
Within the area of the brightly-illuminated grains, a number of dark patches are

seen, and these show the straight boundaries occurring in parallel sets which are
characteristic of twinning. In this instance there are three distinct parallel sets
of dark bands, and the fact that they are twin lamellze becomes apparent when the
stage carrying the specimen is rotated, thus altering the incidence of the light. As
the specimen is turned, the grains that were bright become dark, but presently
some of the patches that were previously dark shine out brilliantly, all the bands
which are parallel to one another flashing out simultaneously. Fig. 4 is a photograph
of the same field as fig. 3 after a rotation of about 30°, and illustrates this appear-
ance. But those parallel bands which catch the light simultaneously are evidently
portions of the crystal in all of which the orientation of the elements has been

changed by the same amount ; in other words, they are twin lamell.
