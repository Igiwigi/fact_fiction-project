Again, a solution of iodide of potassium may be made to absorb the whole of the
oxygen in a narrow tube, by the passage of electrical sparks. This experiment
has been described by Fremy and BEcQUEREL, and I have myself repeatedly verified
its accuracy. With a thermometer tube 2 inches long, the whole of the oxygen may
be made to disappear in the course of one minute. The s0lution becomes always
red from the decomposition of the iodide-of potassium.

We have already seen that neither hydrogen nor nitrogen can be constituents of
ozone, whether it be obtained from electrolysis, or from the action of the electrical
spark on oxygen ; and further, that all the supposed varieties of ozone exhibit in all
respects identical properties.

Connecting all these facts together, it clearly follows,â€”

That no gaseous compound having the composition HO, is formed during the
electrolysis of water ; and

That ozone, from whatever source derived, is one and the same body, having
identical properties and the same constitution, and is not a compound body, but
oxygen in an altered or allotropic condition.
