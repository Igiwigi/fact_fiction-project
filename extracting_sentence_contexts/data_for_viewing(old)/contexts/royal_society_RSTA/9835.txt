of a third group of reactions. It will be seen that a series of small heat evolutions
can be traced throughout the succeeding alloys up to and including pure aluminium,
forming a generically connected series with the point shown in this curve, but
presenting the curious feature that they occur at successively higher temperatures as
the concentration approaches pure aluminium.
Curve No. 45 (46°4 per cent. zinc) shows the same four points which have just been
described in Curve 55, but the peaks at 443° C. and 257° C. are now much smaller.
In Curve No. 35 (33°2 per cent. zinc) only the two upper points persist, all the lower
points having disappeared ; the same remarks apply to Curve No. 05.
x In further reference to the points occurring in Curves 55 to 05 it should be pointed
Q out that the apparently feeble character of this heat evolution arises in part from the
8 fact that it occurs so soon after the commencement of freezing of the alloys; that
§ portion of the cooling-curve upon which this peak is shown slopes backward very
& steeply, and a very considerable evolution of heat is therefore required to arrest and
‘o even to reverse this steep slope. This circumstance somewhat militates against
§ accuracy in the determination of these peaks, the actual peaks shown on the curves
s> being in some cases not very much larger than experimental perturbations which now
sp and then occur. In order, however, to show definite evidence of the existence and
‘4 constant occurrence of these heat evolutions, three cooling-curves of the same ingot
3 are reproduced in fig. 3; a comparison of these three curves will clearly demonstrate
