It should be noted that in typical tadpoles that have existed as such for a few hours
only, phagocytosis of the tail commences at the tip and progresses towards the base
until all the tissue has been stored within the trunk. This progression may be due to

tip, and according to Cumpâ€™s theory of susceptibility one would expect the cells in
the tip to be affected first. * This is supported by the phenomena seen in those tadpoles
that have existed as such for many days (those in water of high pH), where the difference
in age between the base and tip cells of the tail becomes relatively small.
