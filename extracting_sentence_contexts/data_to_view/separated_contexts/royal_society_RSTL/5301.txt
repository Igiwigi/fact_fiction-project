I am not disposed however to leap too suddenly to the conclusion that the
reflected ray in the action of turning through the angle 7—20 has no influence in im-
parting vis viva to the medium®; though it must be conceded that in all cases where
the brightness of the reflected rays accurately follows the laws of FresxEL as tested
by BrewsTER and ARaco, the reflected ray has no sensible influence on the medium ;
for were it otherwise, we ought in an accurate theory of resonance to find a differ-
ence in the values of s and s', as we do in the intensities of the primary and secondary
waves, both reflected and refracted, and we have already seen that such difference of
values will vitiate the law for the secondary reflected ray. It makes all the differ-
ence in the world, whether the vis viva be supposed to be communicated to the
medium at the very instant of the shock, or immediately afterwards ; in the first case
it will be due partly to the reflected and partly to the refracted rays, in the latter
case it, will be due almost entirely to the refracted rays. In all cases, however, it
is natural to snppose that the refracted rays are chiefly instrumental, and this is
indicated by the equality of s and & in isotropical media, without which equality the
laws of FresxEL, BrewsTER and ARaco, could not, according to the present theory,
be accurately, though they might very well be approztmately true, as in fact they
would be if s y, though different from each other, were very small compared with
unity. In clear transparent media, where there is little absorption, s and s are pro-
bably very small, and such being the case, the aboye law of brightness ought to hold,
independent of the equality s=s.

28. I return now to the expressions for the refractive index

EO LS] Ae;
SPS eq I+s

In the first place, it will be remarked that these differ from the value which is
usually adopted, namely, =
1

I confess I always considered that the usual mode of deducing this value from the
spread of the wave, which in fact does not spread, was more elegant than conclusive,
It is connected, if I mistake not, with the idea that the transverse front of a wave of
light, as of a wave of sound, consists of particles all of which are in the same phase ;

* Nevertheless it is worth observing, that at the critical angle (compare No. 39), in the case of 8=s,, it
results from the formule that the absorbing power of the medium has no effect in diminishing the vis viva
when the ray is turned through an angle 7—29 in the operation of reflexion, and this is true both for the
primary and secondary rays.
