They consist of a flat part AB joined to a sloping
part such as AC or AD, whose slope diminishes with diminishing wave-length of the
monochromatic exciting light. The sloping portions all converge to a common point A
of the saturation part of the characteristic independently of the wave-length used. A is the position of the true zero of potential difference, and, in fact, these small currents
are completely saturated in any accelerating electric field, however small. Thus one
method of locating the zero would be to find the convergence point A to the saturation
value of different monochromatic characteristics such as CA, DA. This would, of
