For when a quantity of hot water is poured in and allowed to stand, not only is the top
of the conducting column heated but the bottom of the heating mass is cooled, the two
quickly assume nearly the same temperature, which is below that of the water originally
added. When, therefore, a fresh supply of hot water arrives, its heat has to traverse a
series of strata of water, each of which is at a lower temperature than it would have
been if the supply of hot water had been continuous, â€”that is, if the upper layer of the
column had been maintained at a maximum temperature instead of being only moment-
arily raised to that temperature by each successive addition of hot water to the upper
vessel,

thermometers have become stationary, results from the establishment of thermal equili-
brium between the continual accession of heat from above downwards, and the escape
of that heat through the sides of the containing vessel by radiation and atmospheric
conduction; otherwise it is impossible, with our present knowledge of the nature of heat,
to explain the fact observed, that even after sixty hours the lowest thermometers how
no increase of temperature in the lower strata of the column. III. Description and use of the Diathermometer.
