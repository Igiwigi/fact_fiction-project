These properties, as described in [14], are in many respects
significantly inferior to those of artificial optical systems. Because of these limitations, the first
fundamental question was whether structured illumination on a typical eye could be used to
produce an improved image compared to wide-field imaging. The reconstruction of SIM data is
usually based on the fact that the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system is known to
some extent. After separating the frequency-shifted orders of the image and correcting for the
frequency shift, an individual frequency weighting is applied to each order before summing the
orders. This weighting is based on the optical transfer function (OTF).
