The agreement in the values of each separation is very close and would be wholly
so if 28755 were about 5 larger. As the X. iii. map contains the D,, linkage the term
VD occurs in the formula for 27758 and the 1002 is due to a A displacement in this.
We have in fact two parallel linkages depending on D,, (2) and D,, (—A) respectively.
A similar case is seen in the neighbourhood of X.iv./. The close equality of the
differences between 26842 and the next lines, viz., 46°46 and 46°49, is noticeable and
has been already referred to. Now 46°46 is caused by a displacement +4é on VD,, and
46°19 by —43 on the same. As the VD enters in the formula as a negative quantity,
the smaller wave-number would be due to VD,, (—46) and the larger to VD,, (+40).

The maps bring out certain general peculiarities quite clearly. Amongst these may
be mentioned :—

(1) The majority of the strong lines are connected to the ¢ link either directly or
by an intermediary p link. More especially so in the case of Ag.
