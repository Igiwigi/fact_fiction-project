The results, however, plotted on
the dotted curve of fig. 11 bear out the argument just given and are in close enough
relation to the rest to show that the principles involved are always essentially the
same. As would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of side-chain
modification in @-keratin, the maximum observable effect increases with the percentage
extension at which the relaxation is carried out. Fig. 13, which has been prepared
to show the relation between a number of phenomena, includes a curve showing the
increase of super-contraction in steam as the relaxation extension is increased. (For
this curve, each fibre of Cotswold wool was stretched in cold water to the extension
given by the ordinates, exposed to the action of steam for 2 minutes at this extension,
and then steamed back, with the stretching force removed, as far as it would go.)
