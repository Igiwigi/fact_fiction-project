The series A of magnesium, given by the combination 3d—m/, would become
4D—mF in proto-helium—the numeration being slightly different in the two cases*—
and this would be identical with the formula for the extended Pickering series. Series B of magnesium, given by 3f—mf, would similarly become 4F—mF and would
also coalesce into the Pickering series. -Alternate lines of series B are in fact not far
removed from the Balmer lines, while intermediate lines are near the observed
Pickering lines, as will be seen by comparing Tables XIIT. and XV.; lines near these
positions might also be derived from the F series of other elements in which mF
approximates to 4N/m*. The relative weakness of the Pickering series of proto-helium,
as compared with 4686, is matched in magnesium by the relatively low intensities of
the analogous combination series A and B.

The close relations between the lines of hydrogen (real and hypothetical) and some
of those of proto-helium are simply accounted for by Bour’s theory of the origin of

these spectra.
