supposed to be intermediate in position between primitive ferns and Lycopodiales. He
compared the sporangia of Stauropteris with those of Sphenophyllum and secondly he
postulated that the underground rhizome of Stauropteris would be like its aerial branches,
except that the protoxylem would be exarch. He therefore concluded that in spite of some
analogies Stauropteris shows with the primitive ferns, it really has close affinities with the
Sphenophyllales and Psilotales.

It should be pointed out here that Bertrandâ€™s grouping of Stauropteris with the Spheno-
phyllales and Psilotales is not convincing. First because the speculation regarding the
structure of Stauwropterts rhizome is based on an assumption for which there is no evidence,
and the weight that should be attached to it is very doubtful. Secondly, the comparison
between the sporangia of Stauropteris, and those of Psilotales and Sphenophyllales, is not
convincing. In fact, the terminal position of the sporangium was not peculiar only to


THE MORPHOLOGY OF STAUROPTERIS BURNTISLANDICA 89

Stauropteris, it was a common feature in the Devonian and early Carboniferous plants.
Similarly, I see no resemblance between a synangium of Psilotum or a strobilus of Spheno-
phyllum and a simple terminal sporangium of Stauropteris, which, indeed, is more like that
of Asteroxylon. The discovery of the heterosporous nature of Stauropteris has further com-
plicated the matter.

Stauropteris is, in fact, remarkable in showing a strange combination of characters of
different groups, a fact which perhaps explains the difficulty in assigning to it a correct
