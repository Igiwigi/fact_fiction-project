It is a very prevalent belief that slate-rock (for example), in the form of the sawed
roofing-slate of Anglesea or of Valentia (Ireland), will bear a much greater compressive
load when the pressure is in the direction of the laminz, than in one across them. This
the preceding experiments prove to be wholly a mistakeâ€”one that has very probably
arisen from some vague notion of an analogy with timber compressed the end-way of
the grain.

It is now certain that Silurian slates and quartz-rock, and probably all sedimentary
laminated rocks, whether with cleavage or not, are much weaker to resist a crushing
force edgeways to the lamina, than across the same, and that the range of compressi-
bility is much greater, for equal loads, in the former direction.

The fact now ascertained, as to the great relative compresibility of laminated rock in
the direction of the lamine, also points out the reason of the great bearing-power to
sustain impulsive loads, which the toughest and most cohesive examples of slate-rocks,
8uch as the 8lates of Caernarvyonshire, present ; for there can be no grounds to doubt
that the high compressibility of rocks of this structure in the plane of the lamina is also
accompanied with a high coefficient of extensibility, although probably confined within
much narrower limits as to incipient injury to perfect continuity.

My experiments point out that the Silurian slate of Holyhead (the mean both of the
hard and the oft) is crushed by a load applied across the lamina of about 1250 tons per

s8quare foot, and that its molecular arrangement is permanently injured at a little more
than 1000 tons per square foot.
