THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 231

then after a certain interval of time the parts of the fluid will have returned to the
original configuration with respect to the shell, so that the fluid will have been
rotated bodily in space just like a solid, although its motion at each instant has been
differentially irrotational. In fact when the change of position of the element of
volume is finite we can no longer analyze it definitely into rotations and pure strains,
in such wise that the order of their application shall be indifferent ; thus we obtain
no longer in that way an analytical specification of the ethereal elastic rotation, and
a more precise formulation must be made. The rough material model of § 3 indicates
the necessary modification : in that model a differential pure strain of the element
of volume does not tend to rotate the sub-element which is elastically effective ;
thus the efficient elastic rotation is the vector sum of the series of differential
rotations which the element of the ether has experienced in its previous history. This is therefore the more precise definition of the total rotation, proportional to
(f, 9, h), from which the electrostatic forcive is derived as in Part II., § 18: it makes
the rotation equal to the curl of the linear displacement when these quantities are
both small so that their squares and products can be neglected, but not after the
long-continued cumulative effect of a permanent magnetic field has come in.
