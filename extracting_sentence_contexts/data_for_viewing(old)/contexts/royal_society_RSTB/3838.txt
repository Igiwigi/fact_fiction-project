exercises.

(1) They are not at all connate, but free leaf-members of a normal phyllotaxis
system, rendered thin by radial retardation in growth, but not by tangential extension ;
as already indicated they only extend to the slightest degree beyond their theoretical
boundaries.

(2) The vascular system is visible to the unaided eye, as two beautifully sympodial
systems, coming from two trace bundles each well clear of the median line, which
ramify dichotomously in a manner which distinctly recalls the venation of Gingko.
Ultimate ramifications may become slightly irregular, as in the case of the inflorescence-
bracts and staminate-cone bracts (cf. Lignrer and Tison, 1912); but there can be no
doubt of the fact that these leaf-members are the nearest approach to the ancestral
leaf-venation of the plant now available, since the huge foliage members are
exceptionally specialised. The lack of a median vein has clearly nothing to do with
pressure of the ovule : it is equally absent in the inflorescence-bracts and sterile scales ;
and in this respect it is interesting to compare the leaf-venation of Welwitschia with
that of Ginkgo, Pinus and the Pteridosperms with double leaf-traces (fig. 4).

(3) Histologically these bracts are of greater interest as presenting a graded change
from ‘“shade-construction” in their lower shielded region, to a condition of most
advanced xerophytic specialisation in their upper exposed portions.

Thus, in the lower region, the epidermal cells of the outer surface contain abundant
chlorophyll and small starch grains, the bundles are simple, and the mesophyll cells are
