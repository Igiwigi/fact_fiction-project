On the basis of the information which
has been accumulated, however, I am of the opinion that the continued decline in the
seismic activity and the simultaneous decrease in the rate of emission of gas from the
Gages soufriére following the severe earthquake of 10 November 1935 suggest that
the seismo-volcanic episode which has occurred in Montserrat in the past few years
is now drawing to a close. The results strongly suggest that the dangerous strains in
the earth’s crust in this region were relieved at least temporarily by the occurrence
of this earthquake. These facts should not, however, be allowed to lead to a too easy optimism. On
several occasions in the past, scientific expeditions have been made to the scene of
disasters in these islands and reassuring reports have subsequently been issued on the
