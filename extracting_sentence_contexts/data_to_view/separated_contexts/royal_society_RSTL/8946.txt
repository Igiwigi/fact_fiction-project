668 MR. G. 7. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZ.

previous paper, there is a general tendency for the smaller segments of an Aurelia divided I
in this way to contract less frequently than the larger segments; and more careful
observation this year has not resulted in establishing any more precise a relationship.

1t would be tedious and unnecessary to quote my obseryations in this connexion ; but -
as these observations brought out very clearly a fact which T had prevyiously suspected,
I may detail one experiment to illustrate this point. The fact in question is, that the
potency of the lithocysts in any given segment of a divided Awrelia has more to do with
the frequency of its pulsations than has the size of the segment. As mentioned in my
other paper, one or more lithocysts may often be obseryed to be permanently prepotent
over the others; and I may here observe that the segmentation experiments just described
have shown the converse to be true, viz. that one or more lithocysts are often perma-
nently feebler than the others.
