low, since we know from such instances as Ginkgo that species may survive through very
long periods of geological time.

In any case the figures are quite definite as to order of magnitude. If the age of the
flowering plants is 100 million years, or thereabouts, the doubling-period for species
is probably of the order of some 2 or 3 million years: it is, say, almost certainly over
1 million and less than 6 millions. The present rate of production of viable specific
mutations, amongst all flowering plants on the whole surface of the globe, is almost
certainly less than 1 in 10 years and more than 1 in 60 years; it probably lies between
1 in 15 and 1 in 30 years. The assumption of a polyphyletie origin for the flowering
plants would not very greatly affect these figures. Specific mutations must, therefore,
be such exceedingly rare events that no valid argument, as it seems to me, can be based
on the fact that we have no experience of such occurrences. My calculations fully
confirm Dr. Wrixis’s conclusion in this respect.

It should perhaps be added that of course the figures obtained, for a group so hetero-
geneous as the aggregate of the flowering plants, are of the nature of averages and may
well differ considerably for different families and genera. But it does not seem probable
that the order of magnitude is wholly different.
