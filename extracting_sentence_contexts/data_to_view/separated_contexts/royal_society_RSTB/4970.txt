In one or two species, notably Aloé arborescens Natalensis, where the con-
strictions are, at other stages, very well marked, it is possible to see the suggestion of this
constriction even at the heterotypic metaphase in some of the univalent halves of the
bivalent chromosomes (fig. 14). Occasionally a chromosome in the nuclei of other species at metaphase suggests the
presence of a constriction ; at earlier and at later stages it can be seen that constrictions
are constant features not only of somatic chromosomes, but also of the chromosomes
during meiosis. In profile view of the heterotypic spindles (Plate 19, figs. 21-23), the
only evidence during metaphase and early anaphase of this differentiation is given by
the fact that the spindle fibre is not exactly terminal in the large chromosomes, and in
figs. 22 and 23 of Gasteria nigricans platyphylla the very marked bend in each univalent

of one bivalent is a feature of all the nuclei observed. At diakinesis the constricted parts are sometimes clearly demonstrated (figs. 10, 11, 12),
although frequently in other nuclei which are apparently well fixed all evidence of the
constriction may be lost. Possibly these are later stages of condensation of the
chromosomes, or possibly, as Taytor suggests, the chromosome does condense longi-
tudinally during fixation if the penetration of the fixative is slow.


230 NESTA FERGUSON: THE ALOINA,

Fig. 10 shows the occurrence of more than one constriction in one condensing pair of
chromosomes in a nucleus of Aloé Abyssinica, while in a second bivalent, satellites of
small magnitude occur in addition to the usual constriction.
