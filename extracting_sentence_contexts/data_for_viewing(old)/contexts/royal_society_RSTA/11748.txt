Larmor (‘ 4ither and Matter, p. 152) concludes that the tangential component of
(X’, Y’, Z’) should vanish at the surface of a conductor in steady motion, Strictly,
we have no equations for the interior of a perfect conductor, but we define it as a
body incapable of supporting electric stress. It seems to me necessary to make
(X, Y, Z) and (a, 8, y) vanish, although from one point of view it might suffice to
make (X’, Y’, Z’) vanish throughout the conductor.

We have next to determine how these quantities inside are related to the similar
quantities outside the surface. The fundamental equations integrated through a thin
shell in the usual way show that the tangential component of (X’, Y’, Z’) is continuous,
but the fact that we have no right to assign the fundamental equations or the above
form of (X’, Y’, Z’) to the inside of a conductor raises a doubt. If (X’, Y’, Z’) is
continuous as regards tangential components, then the tangential component ot

(X, Y, Z) is discontinuous because the tangential component of («, 8, y) is discontinuous
and measures the surface current. To avoid this discontinuity of zther strain
tangentially, I consider the possibility that the tangential component of (X, Y, Z) is
continuous. It follows at once that for a perfect conductor we must have either the
condition (1) that the tangential component of (X, Y, Z) vanishes, or the condition
(2) that the tangential component of (X’, Y’, Z’) vanishes, just outside the surface.
