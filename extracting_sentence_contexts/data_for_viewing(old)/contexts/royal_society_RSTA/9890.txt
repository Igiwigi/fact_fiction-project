AND THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE THEORY OF INTEGRAL EQUATIONS. 427

It may be remarked that, as a corollary of this theorem, we have the notable fact
that, if any continuous symmetric function is such that the integrals

are none of them negative, then the functions (8) have the same property.

§11. The properties of the determinants (8) may be used to obtain some idea of the
nature of functions of positive type. Let us suppose, in the first place, that there is
a point (a, a) belonging to Q at which one of these functions «(s,¢) vanishes. The
