In consequence of this, the surface
tension of the small electrode began to increase immediately the connection between
it and the large electrode was broken. As I have subsequently observed, this is an
effect which can be obviated when due care is taken, with pure mercury and a
solution of uniform concentration. The phenomenon does not affect the conclusions
in the present case, but in fact rather increases the interest attaching to the
observations. When the electrodes were joined by a short wire, the surface tension
was different from what it was when they were joined by the graphite resistance. The reading in the latter case was not appreciably affected by reversing the resistance,
so it could be assumed that the graphite did not introduce any appreciable E.M.F.
into the circuit.
