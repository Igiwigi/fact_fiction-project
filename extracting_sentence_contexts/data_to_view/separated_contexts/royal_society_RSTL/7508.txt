pressions appertaining to this branch of the physical sciences. | Thus:—T have used
the terms magnetic pole and poles in their original and natural sense, as designating
© | those points on the surface of the globe where the intensity of the magnetic force is a
- "maximum in comparison with adjacent localities—in other words, the centres of the
\ Jemniscates into which, at our present epoch in the magnetic cycle, the isodynamic lines
_ of highest intensity resolve themselves. 7
In one of the earliest systematic treatises on the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism
as derived from and resting on observation, (that of HALLey in the Philosophical 'Trans-
actions for 1683,) it is unhesitatingly affirmed, on the evidence of well-assured facts,
that © the globe of the earth may be regarded as one great magnet having four magne-
tical poles, or points of attraction, two of them near each pole of the equator; and that
©in those parts of the globe which lie near any of those magnetical poles, the needle is
chiefly governed thereby, the nearest pole being always predominant over the more
Sremote.” It is in this, its original signification, bearing date 80 early as 1683, that I
Shave employed the term © magnetic pole.” The magnetic surveys which have been 80
\Dearefully and systematically made in the course of the present century over almost
*Sall the accessible parts of the globe, may now be considered to have fully confirmed
= the truth of Harry's remarkable anticipation, and may be claimed in full justification
Sby those who.
