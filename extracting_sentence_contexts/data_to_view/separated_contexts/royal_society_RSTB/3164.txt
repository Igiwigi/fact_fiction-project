The stroma cells are darker in colour
and are lined by a very irregular layer of trophoblast cells. In the
middle is a section through one of the villi taken close to the surface so
that only the epithelium is cut through. The diplocaryocytes are recog-
nised by the more deeply staining quality cf their nuclei, and by the fact
that the protoplasm is drawn away from the general surrounding tissue. x 400. â€˜Fig.
