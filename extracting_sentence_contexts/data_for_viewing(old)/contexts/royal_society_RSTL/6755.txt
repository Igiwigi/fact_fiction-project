Lastly in regard to the results in the Table (X1.), the final column, showing the
or loss of Nitrogen, affords us the means of judging how far the molecular actions
which free Nitrogen was given off in the cases of the experiments upon the d
position of nitrogenous organic matter are likely to interfere with the results of
investigations on the question of assimilation of free Nitrogen by plants. It is seen
in the experiments now under consideration, no free Nitrogen was given off during
process of germination and growth. At least, the asswmption that free Nitrogen
given off implies the still more improbable one, that, under the circumstances detai
assimilation of free Nitrogen has taken place ; whilst the adoption of these two assw
tions necessitates the yet more improbable one, that these two independent actions
a most definite relation to each otherâ€”in fact, that the amount of free Nitro
assimilated is exactly equal to that given off during decomposition.

It would appear, therefore, that we way rest satisfied that our results in regard to
question of assimilation will not be affected by a loss of free Nitrogen as the =
the decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter, 80 long as that matter is subjected to
the ordinary process of germination, and exhaustion to supply materials for growth.
Our results in regard to the products of decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter do,
indeed, point to the danger of using nitrogenous organic manure in such experiments, and
to the error that might occur from seeds decomposing in the s0il instead of growing, or
from the decomposition of dead leaves, of old roots, or of nitrogenous organic excretions;
but they do not afford any evidence of what takes place within the range of the action
of the living plant. And, judging from the amount of tree Nitrogen evolved when, as
