Several other naturally competent species rely on similar
modes of species or clone-level recognition to regulate induc-
tion. The Gram-positive species B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae
become competent following detection of a threshold concen-
tration of a secreted peptide signal that is species specific
[16,34]. Because the signal is produced constitutively, its
environmental concentration approximately scales with the
density of producing cells [15,83]. While quorum sensing is

generally sufficient to ensure induction is coordinated among
cells of the same species, it would not allow finer coordination
within species. A possible solution to this problem lies in the
fact that B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae are polymorphic for the
peptide signals they produce (called pherotypes) [84,85], and
there is no apparent cross-talk between a given peptide and
non-cognate receptors [86]. In S. pneumoniae, several groups
have argued that this type of polymorphism could permit
transformation to occur preferentially among cells expressing
the same phenotypeâ€”much like bacterial mating types,
although current results on this issue are mixed [84,87].

By using ecological proximity and quorum-sensing
systems to estimate cell density, bacteria can regulate compe-
tence so that it is only turned on when cells are surrounded
by individuals of the same species. More strikingly, some natu-
