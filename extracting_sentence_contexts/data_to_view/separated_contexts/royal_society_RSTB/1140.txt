GOTCH AND V. HORSLEY

We reserve also to the end of this chapter the pertinent bearing of these observations
upon the important doctrine of kinzsthesis (Bastian). The evidence of the passage of nerve impulses, as indicated by electrical changes,
from the aroused centres in the cord down the afferent (sensory) fibres of the posterior
roots may be grouped us follows :--

(1.) Electrical changes in the posterior roots and mixed nerve with all anterior roots _
cut when the spinal centres discharge under the influence of strychnia.

(2.) Electrical changes in the above structures when the spinal centres are discharged
reflexly.

(3.) Electrical changes in the above structures when the spinal centres are aroused _
by electrical excitation of the columns of the cord.

(1.) The Electrical Changes in the Posterior Roots when the Spinal Centres are Excited —
by Strychnia. i

The most remarkable illustrations of the fact that impulses emerge from a dis- —
charging spinal centre on its afferent as well as its efferent side, is that furnished by —
the following experiments. . In a Cat (211) the cord was divided as usual in the lower dorsal region (11th
dorsal) and both sciatic nerves exposed and divided. The central end of each nerve ~
was connected when desired with the galvanometer.
