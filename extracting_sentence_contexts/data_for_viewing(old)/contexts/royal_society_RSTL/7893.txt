Regarded merely as a disease, Teichopsia, though by no means unimportant, may be
thought hardly deserving of the attention of scientific men'; but regarded as a veritable
Â«Photograph ' of a morbid process going on in the brain, its interest and importance
cannot be too strongly insisted upon.

In conclusion, I regret to be obliged to leave 80 much doubt upon 80 many points of
the subject T have been dealing with. As more: evidence arises, and more systematic
observations are gathered, T hope these doubts may be removed. Meanwhile our duty
is to collect and record facts, in confidence that they will arrange themselves into a theory
s0oner or later. No two cases of this disease present exactly the same features; every
one is am illustration of the rest; and by the accumulation and comparison of accurate
records we may hope that the transition from facts isolated to facts linked by the clue

of theory will be s00n attained.
