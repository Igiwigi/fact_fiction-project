range of pressure at the hill and plains' stations given in the Table aboye, it appears that this difference |
pressure at the height of 7000 feet is probably not more than half as great as at the ground surk ce
where the barometric gradient does not exceed 0-1 inch in 800 miles, or 0-012 in 100 miles (sco page
Take the probable error of þ,, then, as -006. Then increasing the yalue of 3, by that amount, the yalue
will be diminished by 0-001, and that of 4, increased by half as much, The error of the results in the mon

I should expect that the differences of d, and d, are principally due to the real mean temperature of tho 1

error must arise also from the fact that tho adopted values of yapour-tension are probably in all cages low
than the real tensions ; but the effect of this cannot be yery great.
