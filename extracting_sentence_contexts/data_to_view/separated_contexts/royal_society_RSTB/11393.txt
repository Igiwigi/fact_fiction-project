Introduction

Interpersonal interaction and collaboration are key ingredients for individual and
team thriving in social groupings including organizations. This is not a recent
phenomenon. In fact, there are remarkable similarities between groups as diverse
as hunter-gatherer bands [1] and work teams and organizations [2] with respect
to dependence on their membersâ€™ ability to collaboratively identify and exploit
resources critical to individual and group outcomes. Cognition plays a major
role in this process. Importantly, cognition is not merely confined to social knowl-
edge, but also includes knowledge of physical space.
