The yomer in my two young Ornithorhynchi shows no trace of a paired origin, it
is a membrane bone stretching along the under surface of the septum nasi and of the
basis cranii in the orbitotemporal region, terminating just in front of the pituitary. In neither stage has it any connection with the paraseptal cartilages, only reaching
as far forward as their posterior end. That this element does present a striking
resemblance, real or apparent, to the unpaired rostral portion of the parasphenoid of a
lizard cannot be denied, a fact which renders extremely improbable Gavpp’s
explanation of the loss of the rostral part of the parasphenoid in mammals as due to the
complete’ ossification of the base of the orbitotemporal region ; for if this explanation
were true we should not expect another precisely similar splint bone to be developed
in face of the very factors which are supposed to have led to its disappearance. These facts seem to me to establish a case, too strong to be lightly set aside, for the
homology of the os paradoxum with the reptilian prevomers and of the mammalian
vomer with the rostral part of the parasphenoid of reptiles. The most serious objections to homologising the mammalian vomer with the
reptilian parasphenoid are :—
