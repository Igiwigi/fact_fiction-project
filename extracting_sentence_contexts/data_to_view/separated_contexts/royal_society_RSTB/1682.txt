The
6 figure cited from Memoir XVII. demonstrates an interesting point, confirmed by other
ospecimens, uamely, that the anomalous medullary tissues extend through the leaf-trace
spgap along the sides of the normal secondary wood. In the section from which this
: & figure was drawn, the zone of secondary wood is sub-divided by parenchymatous trace-
‘Ss gaps into four masses, each of which is completely surrounded by cambium. We

have, in fact, in this case precisely the anomaly described by DaANGEARD in Acantho-
2 phyllum.t It is probable that the new cambial divisions spread from the normal
Zcambium through the parenchyma of the leaf-gaps into the pith, just as Roprnson
found to be the case in Jodes tomentella.{ Thus in another stem, from which fig. 9

= was drawn, there is a small amount of anomalous wood (a*) behind the outgoing trace

E figured. The anomalous trachez found at the edges of the leaf-trace gaps sometimes

‘have i a horizontal course (“ Organization,” Part XVIL., Plate 13, fig. 3).
= In one or two instances, where the anomalous tissue is mainly parenchymatous, the
z internal cambium appears to have arisen partly from the parenchyma of the primary
& xylem, so that some of the trachex belonging to the latter have been carried inwards
into the pith.§ We omit one or two specially complicated forms of anomalous
8 medullary tissues, which are of isolated occurrence.||
