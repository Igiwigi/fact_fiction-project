Yet, evidence
is accumulating on the importance of more downstream pro-
cesses rather than IIS and TOR [64]. This is also highlighted
by the results of the papers of this issue and underlies the
formulation of the TI-J-LiFe network as a framework for under-
standing processes shaping ageing and life-history trade-offs
[27]. The underestimation of the IIS and TOR components in
some of these studies may come from the fact that they were
gene expression studies rather than mutational analyses. The
former, for instance, might miss signals that are caused by
only slight expression differences. Nevertheless, the recurrent
results that consistently point to a TI-J-LiFe framework across
the studies of this issue are striking and stress that downstream
processes should be included in studies addressing ageing and
fecundity.
