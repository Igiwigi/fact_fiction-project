Every
method of estimation, however, contains elements of uncertainty most of which tend
to make the result too big (cf. p. 203 below). The general agreement between the results
of calculation and measurement is therefore rather striking. The obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length of the
chromosome thread is probably constant throughout mitosis though the closeness of
the coils can change.{ (2) That the thread is twisted at all times except at prophase,
when one twist gives place to another (cf. Koshy 1933; Darlington 1935; etc.). (3) That
except at prophase the twist is perfectly stable and is therefore probably constructional.

* The presence of two kinds of contortions in the prophase chromosome was first, and correctly,
distinguished by Darlington (1935), who gave them the names of “‘super-spiral’’ and “relic spiral”
respectively. These names will not be used here from the general desire to simplify terminology.
“Super-spiral’’, for the zigzag seen in Osmunda is also of doubtful validity. “Super”, in the sense of
“additional” it certainly is, but whether it is a ‘‘spiral” and not merely a fortuitous bending is not
evident.

t In justice to this writer it should be pointed out that his own description of telophase behaviour
in Fritillaria (Darlington 1935) does not exactly accord with his general statement (1937) quoted above.
