The crack-face
tractions arising from the bridging fibres are around 300 MPa at maximum load. Interestingly,
they are compressive (approx. —100 MPa) at Kyin which tends to prop open the crack. This is
partly due to the fact that the bridging fibres are pulled out somewhat at Kmax and partly due to
the original compressive thermal residual stresses in the fibres. Using a weight function approach,
it is possible to calculate the shielding effect of the crack-closing stresses at Kmax and the crack-
opening stresses at Kin. These are shown in §5b and act to greatly reduce the stress intensity
range experienced by the crack as more and more fibres bridge the growing crack.
