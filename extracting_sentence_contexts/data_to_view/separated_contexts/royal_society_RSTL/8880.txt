Although,
Â© most unfortunately, no evidence as to the structure of the generative system of Nille-
Z pora was obtained by the present investigations, the results obtained yield, nevertheless,
S I think, convincing proofs that this interesting form of coral is a true Hydroid. The
5 peculiar structure of the hydrophyton, the forms of the zooids, the absence of all trace
P of mesenteries, the apparent septa present in the tentacles, the presence of the thread-
>h cells of the form peculiar to Hydrozoa, and in fact every item of histological structure
E point irresistibly to the same conelusion. Professor AGa8s1z considered the Millepores
S to be allied to the Hydractiniz, and CLavs remarks on their resemblance in some points
E to the Corynide. Both Hydractinia and Podocoryne resemble Millepora in having a

2 hydrophyton which forms a continuous encrusting layer ; and in essential structure the

15 hydrophyton of these two genera seems closely to resemble that of Millepora.
