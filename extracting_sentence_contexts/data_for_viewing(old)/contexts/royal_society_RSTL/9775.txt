EZ Thexe facts, I think, show that both the cesophageal and gastric glands form zymogen
which under certain conditions, and particularly when acted on by dilute acids, give
S rise to pepsin, The zymogen is only slightly soluble in glycerine.

S Similar observations made on the gastric glands of Triton teniatrs give similar

A content of glycerine extract of the fresh with glycerine extract of the exposed stomach,
but the experiment mentioned above (p. 694) shows that the gastric glands of the
Snake als contain zymogen.

Since the pepsin of the csophageal and gastric glands which we have considered
arise from granules which are visible in life, the fact that the pyloric glands show no
granules in life and yet apparently form pepsin may seem to require explanation.

We know that there are many cells which consist, of protoplasm# and inter-proto-

have shown exists-in 80 many gland-cells to be protoplasm, and the interlibrillar snbstance to be chiefly
