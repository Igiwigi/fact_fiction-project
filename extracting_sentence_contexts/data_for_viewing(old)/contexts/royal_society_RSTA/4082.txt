range of solids levels and dimensions, all of which form stable, axisymmeteric shapes that are
not significantly distorted by the arrest process. The broad range of shapes possible is evident,
indicating not only the potential for simple synthesis of anistotropic colloids by such a process,
but also the fact that such structures will form a rich array of connections within more complex
emulsion microstructures. The shapes of the doublets show smooth, continuous borders that
indicate the fluid-like behaviour of the droplet surfaces. Although almost solid-like in their static
appearance because of the stabilization of shape by internal elasticity, the structures retain their
fluid interface. Similar to monodisperse systems, higher solids levels decrease the doublet arrest
strain because of an increased elastic resistance to coalescence and its associated compression.
Even at the lowest solids concentration of 15%, the lack of perfect spherical shapes is indicative of
the fact that the internal elastic network of the droplet is arresting full coalescence. Also seen
in most cases is the smaller strain predicted at higher radius ratios. Validation of the above
