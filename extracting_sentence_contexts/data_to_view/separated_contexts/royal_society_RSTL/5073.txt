Mary. Had it been much
known I cannot but suppose that the following phrase of Newrox would have obtained
some currency: the English parenthesis, and the italics, are Mary's, not mine.
* Comme tout ce qui regarde les grands hommes peut @tre int6ressant, on sera peut-
ere bien aise de sayoir que NEwroN a souvent dit a Mr. de Morvss que $'il avoit, 6t6
moins vieux il auroit 66 tent6 de revoir sur les dernidres observations sa thGorie de
la Lune, on comme il sexprimoit de Pattagquer de nouveau (to have another pull at the
moon). Je tiens ceci de Mr. de Morvss lni-meme.‚Äù

There is also an interesting fact concerning Ds Motrvrs, which is little, if at all,
cited. Happening one day to have to call on the Earl of Devonshire, he met a man
whom he did not know coming out of the house. This man was Nezwron, who had
come to present a copy of the Principia, and had left it in the antechamber in which
De Morvss had to wait till the Earl was ready to see him.
