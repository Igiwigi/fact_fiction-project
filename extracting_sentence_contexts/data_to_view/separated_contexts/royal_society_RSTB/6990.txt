G. CANNON ON THE ANATOMY

At the same time, however, as the peduncular muscles contract, I have maintained that
Darwin’s muscle also contracts (see p. 123), and actively pulls apart the terga. In agree-
ment with this view is the fact that the coronal nerve can be traced with complete certainty
to terminate on Darwin’s muscle.
