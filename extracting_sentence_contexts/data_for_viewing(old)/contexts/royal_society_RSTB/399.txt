when they are examined as transparent objects; hence the amount of
opaque pigment in the lighter figure (9) is very small indeed.

Figs. 10 and 11, both x 7, represent respectively the cuticle of the left pupal fore-
wings of a green and a grey variety of Vanessa Io. There is seen to be an
immense difference in the ground-colour as well as in the amount of
black pigment. The dark networks seen in these and the two last figures
are purely cuticular in position, and were all drawn from the empty pupa-
cases from which the imagines had emerged. The dentated outline within
the margin of all the fore-wings, and especially distinct in fig. 11,
corresponds to the shape of the imaginal wing which was developed
under this part of the pupal wing. In correspondence with this fact, the
pupal pigments are altered over the area where the imaginal wing will
develope. The pigmented lines indicating the nervures of the imaginal
wing really stop short at the dentated margin, but they are prolonged
beyond as irregular lines of pigment which produce the deceptive
appearance of uninterrupted continuity. It was necessary to describe
the appearance thus far, but it is a subject upon which I am now at work.
The object of the figures is to give a representation of the relative
amounts of cuticular pigment, and not to reproduce morphological
features (viz., the venation, &c.) with exactness.

Figs. 12 and 13, both x 2, represent respectively a dark and a light gilded pupa of
Vanessa atalanta. Although the golden appearance is so much less
