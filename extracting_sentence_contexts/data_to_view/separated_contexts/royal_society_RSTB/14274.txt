Figure 2. Example trials varying in visual similarity (VIS), common setting (COM), the degree to which the ‘linking’ concept is canonically concrete or abstract,
according to the Brysbaert et al. [20] norms, and average participant accuracy on that trial (Acc). (a) A depiction of the scence trial, which is a canonically abstract
concept low in VIS but high in COM; (6) the auve trial, also canonically abstract but low in both VIS and COM; (c) the cow trial, which is canonically concrete but low
in both VIS and COM; (e) the party trial, which is canonically concrete and high in both VIS and COM; (f) the cuse trial, which is abstract yet high in VIS and low in
COM; and (g) the boc trial, which is highly concrete, high in VIS, and low in COM. In (d) we depict the interaction between VIS and COM in predicting participant
accuracy, with the effect of VIS on accuracy increasing in strength as COM decreases; s.d. = standard deviation.

only a 0.65 VIS rating, reflecting the fact that it would not be trial by taking the mean score for the target and match and
easy to solve simply by latching on to relative visual simi- subtracting from it the mean score for the next highest
larities between the target and match. However, rated pair of target and choice image. For the sCIENCE-RELATED
microscopes and test tubes are very closely associated, relative trial (figure 2a), this resulted in a relatively high COM score
to the microscope and other items.
