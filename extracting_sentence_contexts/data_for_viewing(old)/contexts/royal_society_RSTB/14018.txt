This perspective (which is still speculative and not the sensed quantity is returned to its target value. Superficially,
unchallenged [78]) suggests that the complexity of the eco- this example seems to bea purely feed-forward mechanism (sen-
logical niche determines the level of complexity the brain sory to motor), with no predictive loop. However, an alternative
needs to have, in order to be (Bayes) optimal. Statistically, interpretation of this is as a system whose model provides a con-

maximizing model evidence is equivalent to maximizing text-free prediction that the sensed quantity is at its set point. The


loop from sensed quantity to sensory neuron to motor neuron to
sensed quantity could then be seen as a feedback loop. The impli-
cation is that the 2-neuron reflex is in fact the simplest form of
predictive control. Why is this a useful perspective? First, it
answers the objection outlined above. Second, and more interest-
ingly, it furnishes a point of continuity with more complex
models. Including an interneuron between the two, and allow-
ing for this 3-neuron pathway to be modulated by other neural
systems, gives us a context-sensitive prediction of the sort
shown throughout the models illustrated in this paper. This con-
tinuity is essential from an evolutionary perspective, where we
need to account for incremental steps in which one predictive
mechanism may be built upon another.

Finally, it important to acknowledge that brain designs,
