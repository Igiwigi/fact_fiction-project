The values of both B, and W in (2a) and (2b) are for large twists very much
smaller than the corresponding values in (1). It is true that the permeability of (2)
before it was strained, viz, ~ = 1304 for Hy = 5, is much less than the value
p = 1694 for (1) under the same conditions. But the great difference between
(1) and (2) in respect to B, and W for large twists can hardly be due to this fact. It is more likely due to the untwisting of the wire at the various stages of the
process. When the wire had been twisted we found just as for (1) that W diminishes con-
siderably even after 20 cycles of magnetisation.
