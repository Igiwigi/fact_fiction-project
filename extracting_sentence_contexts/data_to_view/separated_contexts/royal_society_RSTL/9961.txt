In leaf III. the variation was normal on
both 8ides, but the firs phase was larger on the left than on the right (—8'5, +43
on the left, —4'4, +78 on the right). In leaf IV. the firs} phase was nearly equal
on both sides (—30'0 on the left, —31'6 on the right), and was followed in both cases
by a normal after effect. But these facts afford no clue to the understanding of the
results recorded in the table, excepting in 80 far as they show that in a well-balanced
leaf—1.e., one which responds to excitation with some degree of equality—whichever
lobe was excited directly had the advantage over the other in the compound variation. That this was 80 was confirmed by the observation that in leaf IV. the negative phase
of the variation, as observed with opposite contacts (the fundamental experiment), was
much smaller (—18'4 on the left, —26'6 on the right) when the opposite lobe was
excited than when a hair adjacent to the leading off electrode was touched. The only
general conclusion that I venture to draw from the experiments is a negative one,
namely, first, that the differences which are observed between the excitatory effects
in the two cases are as little due to mere inequality of response in the two lobes as to

* To be read thus:—In the first phase, the menisens moyed from zero of the scale to —3'4, in tho
8econd, after a pause, from 3:4 to 7:4 in the same direction.
