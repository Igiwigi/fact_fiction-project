Of courss, as each metal and each acid has a value of its own, it does not matter how
they are distributed, thus affording further conclusive proof thab neither solubility,
erystalline form, nor specific volume have any effect upon the microrheosis of a salt.

From the above facts we ee that the microrheometer, nob merely dealing with
the 8uperficial qualities of chemical matter, but bringing to light the fundamental
relations of mass and energy, is likely to become the centre of a new branch of the
science. My next work will consist of an examination of liquid bodies whose thermal
relations are known, 80 as to find a fundamental relation between the energy expended
by elements in forming a certain mass of substance, and the retardation offered by such
gubstances in the microrheometer.
