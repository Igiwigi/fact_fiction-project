Among those who speak
for oralward currents are Lupwic (53, 54), Prouno (76), Cu√©nor (12), and MacBripe (55). Cuknor
notes that the stone canal is almost always free from corpuscles though these may be present abundantly
in the rest of the hydrocele (11, pp. 317-8), but he lays stress on the fact that, in the uninjured starfish,
inward currents are exceedingly difficult to observe and probably only occur intermittently. He also
calls attention to the cleaning action of the superficial madreporic cilia, the probable passage of fluid from
axial sinus into the stone canal, and the influence of the stone-canal ciliation on pressure in the water
vascular system. Lupwia (53, pp.
