Ego-depletion has typically been assessed using
sequentially presented, presumably unrelated tasks of self-
control. For example, resisting sweets (task 1) followed by the
Stroop test (task 2). The fact that task 1 appeared to signifi-
cantly impair task 2, suggested that they were drawing from
a single, limited, domain-general source. However, studies
showing ego-depletion effects have been called into question (a) Material resource
([8,9]; however see [10] for reply]). The ultimate outcome of the ego-depletion controversy,
however, is not central to the resource analogy as it is being
employed here.
