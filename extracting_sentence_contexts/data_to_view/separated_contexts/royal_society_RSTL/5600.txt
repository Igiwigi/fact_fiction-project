71. The same thing may be seen by means of the theory of Fmanants. In fact, con-
sder any emanants whatever of a quantic or quantics; then, attending only to the
facients of emanation, the emanants will constitute a system of quantics the coefficients
of which are derived functions of the given quantic or quantics; the invariants of the
System of emanants will be functions of the derived functions of the given quantic or
quantics, and they will be covariants of such quantic or quantics; and we thus pass
from the invariants of a quantic or quantics to the covariants of a quantic or quantics
