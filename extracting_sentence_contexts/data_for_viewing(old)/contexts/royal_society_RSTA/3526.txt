Comparable results for the small ESD are shown in figure 3b. The small ESD was expected to
do continuous smoothing (only) because its small total capacity (one hour of maximum output)
and its small rate of charge/discharge (one quarter of peak output) both seem to forbid price
arbitrage. There are interesting similarities and differences between the optimal C* trajectories for
the large and small ESDs. Like the large ESD, the small ESD takes the stored energy Q to higher
levels during the night hours 5-9, but in this case not to saturation. Then, both the large ESD and

the small ESD run Q down during the evening peak hours, 16-19. : =

The intuition here is precisely that the small ESD is so small. On inspection of figure 3b, : a
the continuous delivery line D is mostly close to (but above) the stepped commitment line C*. 73
These facts, along with the high level of both D and Q at night, arise because, when using aes
only a small ESD, the WPG must deliver most of its power during the nightly peak of wind : _
strength. To minimize the balancing penalties on these low-priced sales, it is optimal for the small : Ss
ESD to remain unsaturated all of the night, in order to absorb fluctuations in the majority of DN
its deliveries—which must be made at night. Despite this, at the end of the night the optimal : S
policy retains a fairly large quantity Q in store. This reserve, used up in the peak, allows the is

small ESD to deliver the small quantity of energy that it does sell at evening peak prices exactly
on commitment.

Overall, both the small and large ESDs are ‘arbitraging the precision of control’ towards the
evening price peak. During the price peak, both ESDs go from near full to near empty, and both
deliver their cleanest power of the 24h (closest to commitment) at this time, when both selling
