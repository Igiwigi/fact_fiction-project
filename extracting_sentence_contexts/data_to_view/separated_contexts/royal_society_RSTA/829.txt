satisfy the equation (3.4). We are only concerned at present with those solutions of (3.4) which tend to
zero as r tends to infinity, remain finite for all values of 0, and have period 2z in w. The functions ¢"G,, eG,", and eH,” provide all the solutions satisfying these
conditions, if n takes all positive integral values, including zero, and m takes all
positive integral values such that m = n, this restriction being due to the fact that
P,” (cos 6) vanishes if m > n.

The typical solutions for u,, v, w. are the functions e“G,, eG,", and e*H,". Our
problem is to find combinations of these solutions such that (3.2) is satisfied. With this object in view, we shall first obtain formulae expressing the partial deri-
vatives of the typical solutions with respect to x, », and z in terms of other typical
solutions.
