The firs6 ring was considerably broader and less sharply defined than the
others; yeb in obtaining the diameters recorded in the tables below I have relied
on a single reading of each side even of the first ring. For during a long course
of preliminary measurements I had found, that two readings of the first ring
would seldom differ more than }', thongh I could not be confident that the true
reading lay within 4' of either. Ib seemed in fact to be easier to bring the
needle back to the same point in the band than to make snre of that point being
the middle of the band. To obtain real accuracy I relied on varying the conditions
as much as possible. Thus the four sets of measurements recorded in Table I.
were made on four different days with different positions of the polariser, analyser, and
plate of quartz.
