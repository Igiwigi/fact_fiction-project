and probably considerably less. Their cause must therefore be near the upper
surface of the crust. Assuming that the inhomogeneity arises from a complex structure in
which rocks of different density are present, an idea of the order of magnitude can be
obtained from the fact that two semi-infinite horizontal layers of rock 3 km. thick separated
by a vertical interface and differing in density by 0-2, would give a gravitational field at a
level 5 km. above their upper surface, having a maximum gradient of 1 mgal/km. directly
over the interface and an overall difference of 25 mgals.
