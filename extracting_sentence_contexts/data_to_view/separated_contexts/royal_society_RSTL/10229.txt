Borson's explanation does
not account for the facts observed. I conclude that he failed to obtain the same result
by nob leaving the mixture long enough in contact with dry phosphoric oxide. I may
add that during the last two years, several of my pupils have repeated the experiment
in the Balliol College laboratory, so that the fact of the non-inflammability of the dry
gases when submitted to an electric spark under ordinary pressure and temperature,
may fairly be considered beyond the possibility of doubt. Experiments have already been described in which the addition of water to a non-
explosive mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygen has rendered it explosive. Into one
: of the explosion tubes above described a piece of potash (previously fused and heated
to redness in a silver boat, and allowed to cool in a desiccator) was introduced.
