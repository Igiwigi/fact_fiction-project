Edinburgh, February 26, 1845. Note on the Velocity of Lava, referred to in p. 149. The following are a few facts which I have collected on the velocity of lava. That
of Vesuvius in 1805 appears to be the most fluid on record. Von Bucn, who was in
company with MM. pz HumBorpr and Gay-Lvssac, describes it as shooting suddenly
before their eyes from top to bottom of the cone in one single instant-, which must cor-
respond to a velocity of many hundred feet in a few seconds without interpreting it lite-
rally.
