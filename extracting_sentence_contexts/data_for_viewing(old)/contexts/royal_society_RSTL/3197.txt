delicate axis of brass, set on points in metallic rings r, r'. These are fixed in the centre of the plates a, b. The
reed and ball on the upper one is a little heavier than the counterpoise 7; on the lower one the counterpoise is
heavier than the reed and ball. Thus, in a neutral state, the balls lie parallel with the surfaces of the plates, and
rise from them by repulsion, with the slightest force. It is only requisite to observe, that the pith balls should
not in the neutral state actually zouck the surface, but remain elevated within a very small distance of it,

which may be readily effected by fixing a small lip of cork to the plate just under the reed. By this we ayoid
any adhesion of the ball to the plate, which interferes with the success of the experiment.


220 MR. HARRIS ON THE ELEMENTARY LAWS OF ELECTRICITY.

9. Pursuing this view we may further infer, as in fact may be shown experimentally,
that similar inductions really tend to arise in both the subsequent experiments 2, 3,
notwithstanding the presence of the similar or dissimilar electricities ; that is to say,
inductive forces tend to arise in each disc, 8imilar to those which would ensue if
either plate were reduced to a state of neutrality, thus increasing the amount of the
attractive forces in the case of the plates being charged with opposite electricities,
and decreasing that of the repulsive forces when the discs are charged with similar
electricities*: the laws of electrical attraction and repulsion therefore are intimately
associated with these inductive forces; hence, as obseryed by Farapay, it is requisite
to examine rigidly the nature and operation of this wonderful influence.

10. There are many striking phenomena of electrical induction, which lead us to
conclude that it is in some way dependent on the presence of an exquisitely subtle
