340 MESSRS. A. AND BE. NEWTON ON THE OSTEOLOGY OF THE SOLITAIRE.

Of the coracoid (Plates XIX. figs. 76-83, XX. fig. 136) the collection contains
twenty-seven more or less perfect specimens, besides the anterior extremity of eleven
others, thirty-cight in all. This most significant bone differs yery greatly from the cor-
responding part in Didus—a fact not perhaps s0 surprising when the exceedingly abnor-
mal form which it assumes there is taken into consideration. It is in Pezophaps pro-
portionately much more bulky, and generally smoother. At its sternal end it differs
from Didus, and indeed from all Columbine birds, in the extension and rounding off of
the outer border 80 as entirely to mask the more or less elongate process which in some
of the Columbide® (Columba tivia for instance) is turned distinetly forwards. Corre-
sponding with this the inner border is produced into a sharper angle, though blunt at
the tip, than it is in Didus, and much more 80 than in most other Pigeons*. Making
allowance for the extreme attenuation of the coracoid in Didrs, which is its especial
characteristic, the snrfaces of the coracoid in Pezophaps present, on closer study, much
the same aspect. The upper surface at the sternal end (Plate XIX. figs. 78, 82) is
more convex, and the lower one is less flat, but generally perforated with similar pneu-
matic foraminafF, though these are variable in shape and extent, and sometimes, though
