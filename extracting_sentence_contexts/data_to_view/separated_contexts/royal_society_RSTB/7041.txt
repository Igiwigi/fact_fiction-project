A bud was also present, in a position near the base of the cone in the
axil of P, or between P, and P,. Scales (not shown in the illustration) were present round
the base of the cone, and also along the margin of the necrosed distal tissue; scales are never
formed in the latter position in a normal apex. A comparable specimen is illustrated in
figure 66, plate 28; in this specimen it was difficult to determine whether the largest leaves
of buds 7 and 8 really belonged to these buds or to the original shoot apex; they are, in
fact, in phyllotactic continuity with P,, P, and P,. In the specimen illustrated in figure 64, plate 28, the apical cell was punctured with
minimal necrosis of the adjacent cells. Two new leaf primordia (P, and P,) and two buds
have been formed since the beginning of the experiment.
