its being assigned wholly to ammonia. The agreement in the intensities is also
satisfactory on the whole. The series investigation, so far as it goes, thus confirms
the identification of some of the solar lines with band lines of ammonia. A general
consideration of the intensities of the representatives of the @ to Â¢ series in the solar
spectrum appears to indicate a closer agreement with the arc than with the flame
spectrum, the lines in the ne#ghbourhood of the central maximum being relatively

enfeebled in each case. This is in accordance with the fact that all the brighter lines
composing the central and secondary maxima as seen in the are, some of which do not
occur in the flame, are represented in the solar spectrum.

The outcome of the comparison is to show that of the 260 band lines of ammonia in
the region \ 3450 to \ 3286, there are about 140 which correspond with previously
unidentified faint lines in the solar spectrum. About 100 of the remaining lines are
obscured by lines for which metallic origins have been found, or fall upon lines which
are too strong in the sun to be attributed entirely to ammonia, and the few which
fail to appear in the sun are all of low intensity.

It may be that additional solar lines are identical with lines composing the bands
of ammonia which appear in the visible spectrum, but there are at present no
