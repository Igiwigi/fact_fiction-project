specimen, individuals from all our crosses that have survived the first year of their
existence. To render this account more intelligible, descriptions of the pure parent
species have also been included. These, with the exception of that of H. acutus,
have been based on small specimens raised from the egg in the laboratory, the
age of which was definitely known. The specimens described have been selected
so that all might be of as uniform size as was possible under the circumstances of the
case. It was impossible to be absolutely certain of many of the points in the
descriptions, as the examination of the hybrids had to be confined to observations
on the living animal, as we wished to keep as many of the hybrids alive as possible.

It is remarkable that we have never been able to keep the pure-bred urchins ot
Â£. acutus alive for more than a few months after metamorphosis. This is, moreover,
singular, from the fact that the cross #. esculentus 3 x E. acutus $ grows very well
under laboratory conditions. We have had to rely, therefore, in our description of
E. acutus, on material obtained from the trawl, the exact age of which is unknown.
Small #. acutus are very seldom brought up by the trawl, and we have never been
successful in obtaining any at Plymouth smaller than 2 cm. across the test. If,
however, we are to judge from the rate of growth of LZ. esculentus ? x E. acutus f
hybrids, then these young #. acutus cannot be more than eight or nine months old.
It is natural to suppose that on the beds where the full-grown adult H. acutus are
found in such great numbers, it would be equally easy to obtain numbers of young
E, acutus, but all the young urchins brought up by the dredge or trawl are invariably
E. esculentus. It is possible that in the young stage, when the test is not more than
5 mm. in diameter, there may be no distinction between the young FZ. esculentus and
E. acutus. This is doubtful, on account of the difference between these two forms at
