& These means represent the whole of the observations made in each month at the

&veral stations ; at the sea-level they include nearly the whole of each month, but on
e mountain only about half a month each ; this cireumstance, however, will not touch
Se great fact now brought to light, of the mean temperature arriving at its maximum
Srlier at 10,702 feet than at 8903, and at 8903 earlier than below it.
A Over and above this effect, the temperature appears to follow the law of decrease with
altitude, but in an accelerating ratio s0 far as these 7hree stations would indicate, which
will be considered in the department of the © peripatetic” observations ; and T1 would
now rather advert to the most remarkable feature of all in the mountain climate, viz.
the excessive dryness, amounting at Guayara, in the contrary terms of humidity (satura-
tion=100), to 26, and at Alta Vista to 38, as the mean for two months, against 66 at
the sea-level; or, in terms of grains of moisture in a cubic foot of air equally compressed
in each case, to 1:5, 1-6, and 6-2.
