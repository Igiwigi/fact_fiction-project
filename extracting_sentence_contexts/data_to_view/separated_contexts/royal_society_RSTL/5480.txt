If we operate on muscles of frogs which have perished
in nitrous or hydrosulphuric acid, we obtain the same results as from frozen museles. PROFESSOR MATTEUCCT'S ELECTRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCHES. 135

Before quitting this subject, 1 gladly avail myself of this opportunity of mentioning an
important fact discovered by M. Du Bots ReyMoxd. From the period of my earliest re-
searches in electro-physiology, I had vainly endeavoured to obtain electrical phenomena
from the nerves of a living animal, or of one recently killed; and even now it is demonstrated,
that, notwithstanding the use of the most delicate modern galvanometers, no sign of elec-
trical current is to be obtained from a nerve laid bare in a living animal and left in its
natural state, M. Du Bois ReymonD has, nevertheless, demonstrated, and the fact is
easily verified with a very delicate galvanometer, that a piece of nerve detached from a
living animal prepared and disposed in the same way as a half-thigh, in the circuit of the
galvanometer, produces constantly an electric current, which, like that of the muscle, is
directed from the surface of the nerve to the interior in the galvanometer. I have proved,
by experiments made on pieces cut from the lumbar nerves of a frog, that the intensity
of the current of the nerves increases with the number of elements united to form a pile,
and that a pile of five or six of these elements acts on the nerve of a galvanoscopic frog
and excites contractions.
