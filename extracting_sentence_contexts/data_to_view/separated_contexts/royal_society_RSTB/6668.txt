In 1934 my former colleague, Mr F. C. Bawden (Bawden 1934), described a disease
of the potato to which he gave the name Foliar Necrosis, ascribing it to a virus he
called D, and called attention to the fact that many of the reactions induced by this
virus were identical with, and others akin to, those produced by the X virus. Evidence
will be adduced for the view that the virus D conforms more closely to the status of a
strain of the X virus than to that of an independent species. For that reason it appears
both more correct and convenient to designate it as the X‚Äù strain of the X virus.
