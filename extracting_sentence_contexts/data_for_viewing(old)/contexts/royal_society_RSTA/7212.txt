It might be expected that where the tides are small over a large region of the ocean,
the cotidal systems may become very complicated, and the chart of cotidal lines as
given by Goldsbrough and Colborne shows a very complex system of four amphidromic
points between pole and equator, in our notation, as follows:

one at 7 = 61°-5 on the central meridian,
one at @ = 44° on the central meridian,
two at @ = 34° on the meridians y = +18".

The closeness of these amphidromic systems raises difficulties of interpretation, so
much so that the question needed to be considered as to whether the systems were real or
simply due to inaccuracies of the solution. Some weight was given to this doubt by the
fact that the amplitudes of tide in the region are very small and only two or three times
the known errors of the solution (judging from the fact that the solution gives amplitudes
of 37-6H and 36-6H at the boundaries on the equator, and as these should be equal, the
possible error appears to be 0-5H). Further, one would naturally expect the null lines on
¢, and , to be more regularly spaced than the solution indicated.

Professor Goldsbrough kindly supplied the values of the elevations computed for
values of at intervals of 0-1, and the values of y at intervals of 10°. A scrutiny of these
immediately yielded the result that an amphidromic system near the pole had been
overlooked, at @ = 6°, y = 0, but otherwise the numerical values appear to offer no
support to the possibility that the complex systems were due largely to errors of approxi-
mation.
