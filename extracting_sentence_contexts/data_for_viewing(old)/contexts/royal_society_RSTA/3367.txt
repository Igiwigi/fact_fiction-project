underestimation of the energy necessary to create Zr*+ centres.

A comparison of the adsorption of an H atom on either the O sites of TiO2 or ZrOz, or the
Ru sites of the cluster, shows unambiguously that this latter is the preferred situation. H adsorbs
preferentially on Rujo, forming strong Ru-H bonds with hydride character. A spontaneous, non-
activated, dissociation of the Hz molecule occurs on the Ru cluster whose role is to split hydrogen
and to bind a large amount of H atoms. Up to three H atoms can be added per Ru atom in the
cluster, with an overall exothermic reaction, figure 5, in agreement with other estimates (e.g. for
H on Pt [60]). This clearly shows that the role of the Rujo cluster is to split the Hz molecule in
a barrierless process and to generate isolated H atoms that can diffuse to the oxide surface once
saturation coverage on the cluster has been reached, figure 5.

In fact, direct spillover of hydrogen from the Ru particle to the oxide surface is unfavourable
at low hydrogen coverage. Two H atoms on the Ru cluster are 0.3-0.4eV more stable than one
H atom on the metal and the other on the oxide. The cost to displace H from Ru to the oxide,
however, decreases gradually as more hydrogen is adsorbed on the metal cluster. At a coverage
of about 30 H atoms on Rujg/TiO2, it becomes thermodynamically favourable to move one H
from the metal to the oxide. On zirconia the situation is similar, but the effect appears already for
a coverage of 24 H atoms. We also estimated the barrier for the diffusion of an H atom from the


metal particle to the TiO2 surface. This is about 0.4 eV, very close to that reported recently for the
same process in a different study, 0.45 eV [53].

Previous studies on hydrogen diffusion on the anatase TiO2(101) surface have shown that
