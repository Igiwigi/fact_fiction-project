CONDUCTIVITY OF SODIUM HYDROXIDE IN AQUEOUS SOLUTION. 281

The solution volumes, V, of 1 gramme of sodium hydroxide at 18° C. are given in
the last column of Table VI., together with the total hydration, H, of the solution
expressed in molecules of water per molecule of soda. When these are plotted against
one another, they give the hyperbola-like curve of Diagram IV. The symmetry of
this curve, though not exact, is of interest because it appears to indicate that the
process of hydration, on which the contraction of volume depends, proceeds
continuously from the most concentrated to the most dilute solutions. From this
point of view it was of interest to inquire at what dilution the molecular volume
would reach its limiting value. A more careful study of the curve of Diagram IV.,
in conjunction with a similar curve in which the molecular volume was plotted against
the logarithm of the hydration, revealed the fact that there was an alteration of
curvature at about 45 per cent. NaOH and a further change at about 5 per cent. It
was possible, however, to obtain remarkably concordant results for the limiting value
of the solution volume by two entirely different methods of extrapolating from the
densities between 1 and 5 per cent. The following table shows the agreement between
the observed densities and those calculated from the formulze

(a.) P— po = 0°01141P — 0:000052P%,
(b.) logy p/py = 0°00496P — 0-000049P?,

where p, is the density of water, p the density of the solution, and P the percentage
of sodium hydroxide.
