A srupy of the published determinations of the capacity for heat of the elements
leads to the conclusion that further information of an accurate nature is desirable. It
will be found that, in most cases, the values are deduced by observations of the heat
absorbed or given out when the changes of temperature are large, and the conclusions

derived therefrom are based on the assumption that the relation between the specific
heat and the temperature is of a linear order.

Again, some, in fact a large majority, are comparative determinations and
dependent on the capacity for heat of other bodies, as, for example, those which
assume REGNAULt’s values for the capacity for heat of water at ordinary tempe-
ratures—values which we now know to be inaccurate.

The experimental difficulties connected with the method of mixtures are considerable
and that method has probably been pushed to its extreme limits of accuracy. The
agreement between the results obtained by different observers, and also between those
resulting from repetition by the same observer, is rarely satisfactory. The tempe-
rature changes have, as a rule, been measured by means of mercury thermometers,
without a proper appreciation of the difficulties attendant upon the use of those
instruments for accurate work,
