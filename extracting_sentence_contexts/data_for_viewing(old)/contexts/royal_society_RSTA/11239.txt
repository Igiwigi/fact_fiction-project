Curve No. 3 up to the stress of 35 tons per square inch. This maximum load of
35 tons to the square inch (now 17Â°50 tons total instead of 26:91 tons as before
turning down) was kept on for 1 hour, with the result that slight creeping took place,
as is shown in Curve No. 4. On augmenting the load a distinct yield-point was got
at 874 tons per square inch. This second yield-point happened at a lower stress than
would naturally have been expected, for in Diagram No. TV. the same material is
shown to have been subjected to a stress of over 40 tons per square inch without
a second yield-point having been passed. The lowness of the yield-point in the
present case, was probably due to an inherent weakness in the specimen, which was
shown by the small flaw which ran up the centre of the bar.* Owing to the specimen
having been turned down this weakness would exert a greater influence than when
the bar was of the full diameter of 1 inch. Experiments on another specimen of the
same material, in fact, directly showed that after turning down a yield-point was
obtained, at a stress lower than that to which the specimen had already been sub-
jected without other than elastic yielding resulting. Such behaviour was anomalous.
With other material which exhibited no flaw, turning down was found to have no
effect on the position at which subsequent yielding took place.

The second yield-point shown in Diagram VII. having been passed, the material
was once more in the semi-plastic state, so to effect recovery it was placed in boiling
water again for 10 or 15 minutes. On cooling and re-testing, a third yield-point
was obtained at 414 tons per square inch, as is shown by Curve No. 5, Diagram VII.
The specimen was once more put in boiling water and then tested, with the result
that fracture occurred at a stress of 50 tons per square inch. The break was outside
the central 8-inch length, close to the tapering neck joining turned and unturned
