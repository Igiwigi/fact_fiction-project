The general features of the vascular anatomy of 7m. Vieillardi are represented
diagrammatically in text-fig. 3.

Sporangiophores.—The sporangiophores of Z'’m. Vieillardi are confined to the distal
half of the shoot. The leaf-lobes are identical in all respects with the foliage leaves
characteristic of this species, but there appears to be nothing distinctive in the shape
or structure of the synangia. As described long ago by Juranyiy in “ Z'm. tannensis,”
the main synangial bundle runs a short distance into the septum. It gives off, right and
left, the two girdle-like traces discovered by Miss Syxus§ in her New Zealand specimens ;
but in my specimens of 7’m. Vieillardi these traces passed only about half-way round the
septum.

In describing the spores of 2m. Vieillardi attention must be drawn to the fact that
on many of the plants the synangia, although outwardly normal, invariably contained
spores of several different shapes and sizes. Most of these were quite unlike those we
are accustomed to associate with the Psilotaces (text-fig. 5 a-e). They are evidently

abnormal and will be described later. In the same synangia there were also some
others (text-fig. 5 f-g) which may perhaps be regarded as the normal ones for the species,
for spores of only this size and shape were found in some plants from another locality
