The two positions of the cutting plane
will coincide, if either the Hessian or this expression vanishes ; the latter, regarded as
a relation between the coordinates of the line, expresses the condition that the plane of
section may contain both principal tangents, 9. 6. may be the tangent plane, as may be
verified by the following considerations. If the plane of section coincide with the tangent

plane, then

A:B:C:D=u:0v:w:k; or nu =o'a+M, wÞ'=n3 +20, ..,
which, being substituted in the expression in question, will cause it to yanish identically ;
or we may proceed otherwise, thus: regarding A, B, C, D as the constants of the cutting
plane, the equation H=0 is ;

and since this plane passes through the point (a, y, 2, t), we have also

by means of which three equations the ratios A:B: C:D may be determined. By a
process quoted by Professor CavLey (Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, yol. vii. p. 1),
the s0lution of these equations depends upon the 8quare root of the quantity

which is in fact identical with the expression (41). The locus of the points for which one of the principal tangents meets a given line,
