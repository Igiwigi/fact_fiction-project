As Mr. Lapace and myself have pointed out, we consider that conjugation is now
entirely lacking in all these forms. This view receives additional support from
the fact that I have not found it (nor has anyone else) in Bodo,

If we can feel assured that the binucleate flagellates do not undergo syngamy—
a negative is, strictly speaking, impossible of proof—and when we see that other
(quite probably all) more or less closely related forms among these lowly proto-
mastigine flagellates, which possess no kinetonucleus, do undergo syngamy, we have

an important pair of facts, which may well be correlated. I suggest, therefore,
that there is a close connection between these two developments, namely, the
presence of the binucleate condition and the absence of syngamy.

In any endeavour to explain this connection, however, we are at once presented
with the difficult problem whether the binucleate flagellates lost the process of
syngamy first and developed the binucleate condition subsequently, or whether the
latter arose first, and, as a result, all necessity for syngamy became lost. Further,
since in all probability the forms from which the Binucleata are descended under-
went a process of syngamy and possessed only a single nucleus, I am obliged to refer
in the first place to the much-debated question of what is the significance of
conjugation itself, notwithstanding the opinion of a well-known protistologist that
one might as well inquire the meaning of the moon.
