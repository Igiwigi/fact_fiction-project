arget and are consequently highly correlated. This makes it potentially useful for
cross-links to develop (or evolve) between the two systems, especially if one happens

o be faster or more reliable than the other under certain conditions. It is quite
ikely, though, that accommodation evolved much earlier than vergence (Horridge
1987; Fernald 2000), and so there may be more of a natural tendency for accommo-
dation to drive vergence than vice versa. We know empirically that there are actually
wide ranges of individual differences in these cross-links in humans, and that they
are likely to be crucial when it comes to problems arising from using non-standard
viewing devices. Clearly, we must exercise some care to deal appropriately with these
issues.

The fact that we need not, and probably should not, constrain our evolved robotic
systems to match known biological evolutionary history is one area where our robotic
systems have the potential for performing even better than the corresponding human
systems.

8. Conclusions

In this paper I have demonstrated how allowing populations of simple adaptable
control systems to evolve by natural selection can produce individual systems that
are able to perform and adapt efficiently under a range of conditions. A Baldwin-type
interaction (Baldwin 1896) between learning and evolution results in the emergence
of appropriate innate values for each parameter in the system, along with appropriate
(different) learning rates for each parameter. We also observe a natural propensity
