It should be added that, in unconsciously relaxing his standards for the larger specimens,
Rowe was influenced by taxonomic considerations that turn upon relative growth rates. To anticipate a little here, it may be said that Rowe defined both Epzaster gibbus and
Muicraster coranguinum var. latior in terms of characters which show allometric growth. Thus in selecting for Epiaster gibbus, for the passage forms between this species and
Muicraster coranguinum, and for M. coranguinum var. latior he was led to favour large speci-
mens, because, other things being equal, the larger the specimen the better developed
the diagnostic characters would be. â€˜This is numerically demonstrated in table 4 by the fact
that, in these three cases the row means are larger, and the row variances smaller, than
for M. coranguinum auctorum. In addition, on this hypothesis Epiaster gibbus should have a
larger mean and a smaller variance than its passage form, the selection of large forms
having been more marked in the former than in the latter. And so it has, as is demon-
strated by the table.

(c) The age distribution of the sample

The Northfleet population of fossils itself is already unrepresentative of the original
living community from which it was derived.
