the direction cosines of a normal to the surface, we shall have, as in the case of the
uniformly magnetized solid previously considered,

g=[i] cos 0=[i].a+[im] rem 0s gu oe has (1).
If, according to the usual definition of * density,‚Äù k denote the density of the magnetic
matter at P, in the continuous distribution through the interior, the expression found
above for the quantity of matter in the element &, B, y, leads to the formula

T7 d(u) , d(im) , d(in)

These two equations express respectively the superficial distribution, and the con-
tinuous distribution through the solid, of the magnetic matter which entirely repre-
sents the polarity of the given magnet. The fact that the quantity of northern watter
is equal to the quantity of southern in the entire distribution, is readily verified by
showing from these formula, as may readily be done by integration, that the total
quantity of matter is algebraically equal to nothing.

43. If there be an abrupt change in the intensity or direction of the magnetization
from one part of the magnetized substance to another, a slight modification in the
formulz given above will be convenient. Thus we may take a case differing very
little from a given case, but which instead of presenting finite differences in the in-
tensity or direction of magnetization, on the two sides of any surface in the snbstance
of the magnet, has merely very sudden continuous changes in the values of those
elements : we may conceive the distribution to be made more and more nearly the
same as the given distribution, with its abrupt transitions, and we may determine the
