In terms of form, the only difference between the two

Hamiltonians is in the prefactor of ,f1. We will denote this prefactor (without the minus) by €. One therefore has
inf F 4 v2(y) cot (rv2(y)/2)

éc = 2G )a, ERM = 7 1-%y) (5.6)

Moreover, the true Hamiltonian corresponding to the ICs of localization would be
(A)ox(h Ja, 01(hic =f + Ea) + a ®t th—svi i] (6.7)

with & € (Erm, &; gint] (the order is determined by the fact that —&@ inf produces the infimum, so it is
smaller and its negative is larger). The main premise of this derivation is that if the values of gq and are close enough, then
the true Hamiltonian at localization ICs and an expression obtained under the assumptions of
resonance are close enough such that any of the expressions could be used for the construction
of the LPT. If indeed this is the case, then considerations of convenience should determine the
choice.
