There is good evidence that a plant
virus with appropriate treatment may be induced to mutate at an increased pace. Such acceleration we have seen happen when X is introduced into a member of the
family Chenopodiaceae or, in the case of the Y virus, when it is passed through
Schizanthus and possibly also when certain treatment is applied to root fibres of
infected plants. It should be observed, however, that although virus mutations must be accepted as
facts, it does not follow that a mutation has taken place every time a change of reaction
is observed in an apparently pure line. A change, even a sudden change in reaction,
may be due to selective agency operating on a mixture of strains. We have seen that an

artificial mixture in which X° and X% are mixed in proportions of 9:1 induces a
