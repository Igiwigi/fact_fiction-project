Some of the earliest appearances presented by muscle, in its formation out
of blood-corpuscles, were given in one of my former communications to the Society. The muscles then examined, being involuntary, did not afford s0 interesting a field
for observation, as those the development of which has since had my attention,â€”the
voluntary muscles ; nor did I then prosecute the investigation farther than as oppor-
tunity was incidentally afforded. Nevertheless, it will be seen that the facts I have
now to mention, accord with those stated in that memoir.

161. Corpuscles more or less blood-red, and having the appearance of young
blood-corpuscles, apply themselves to one another in the manner represented in
fig. 135, and also in the memoir just referred to; by which a necklace-like object
is produced. These corpuscles are cells, which I have found filled with discs ().
