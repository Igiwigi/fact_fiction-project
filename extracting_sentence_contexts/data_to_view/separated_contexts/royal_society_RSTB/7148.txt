The larval ninth
sternite disappears completely, and the vestigial insula which will develop anew on the
hypodermal fold between the two sections of the atrium does not as yet show in the larval
stage. The tenth tergite develops from a pair of hypodermal proliferative spots which
appear inside the rectum during the prepupal stage. The hypoproct also arises from a new
proliferative area behind the caecus invagination.

(c) Development in the pupa
(i) The primary reproductive system

The following facts can be ascertained by following the development of the ovary in
the pupa:

(1) The ovary has been continuously extending, mostly towards the anterior segments
along the line of the terminal filament. In the old pupa it reaches to the fifth abdominal
segment anteriorly and to the middle of the seventh segment posteriorly.

(2) The ova have arranged themselves around a central tube, which is formed by the
compact arrangement of previously scattered follicular cells. These latter gradually cease
to be dispersed among the ova and concentrate around the central tube.

(3) A definite follicular layer surrounds each oogonium which continues to be connected
with the follicular central tube for some time and separates later in the old pupa.

(4) A special cell at the base of the oogonial group becomes distinguishable as the true
oocyte.
