The experiments described in this section contradict the results of Hunt (1929, a, b,
1931) and Witter and Raw es (1931), who, using the chorio-allantoic technique,
found that the posterior portion of the primitive streak is not capable of self-
differentiation in the absence of HENsEN’s node (i.e., of the area lying immediately
round the primitive pit). They have argued from these results that HENsEN’s node is
similar in its developmental importance to the dorsal lip of the blastopore in Amphibia,
the capacity of which for self-differentiation is well known, and further, that, like the
dorsal lip, the node exerts an organising influence on its surroundings. Naturally, the
fact that an embryonal area has a capacity for self-differentiation does not prove that it
is an organiser. But there are further grounds for such an assertion if it can be shown
that no other part of the embryo has a similar capacity. As regards the organising
function of the node, therefore, the important part of Hunt and WiLL1ER’s work is the
negative conclusion that the posterior part of the streak is not capable of self-differentia-
tion: their results on this point are shown to be inconclusive by the experiments
described above and by others to be described in the section dealing with grafts.
