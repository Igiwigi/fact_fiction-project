their capacities for heat in a still more rapid ratio than water,
we should undoubtedly expect, from the innate differences
between the specific heats of these three substances, to find
that they would move independently on each other, or at
different rates. But their uniform advance together, while
water alone varies in this respect, shows distinctly, that in the
water resides the cause of the variation. This reasoning may
be illustrated in many ways, but by nothing more clearly than
the exploded astronomical system of the ditirnal and annual
movements of the sun and fixed stars; in support of which,
very extravagant hypotheses had to be contrived.

The single fact of the motion of the earth once admitted,
reduced the PToLEMA1c chaos to order. If, in like manner, we
should suppose an increasing ratio in the specific heat of water,
then we must also suppose a much more rapid increase in the
ratios of the above three substances, although their individual
specific heats are greatly inferior to that of water. Ought
not that body, which has of all others the most decided relation
to heat, or highest specific heat, to have also its ratio most
decidedly or rapidly augmented ? In adopting the increasing
specific heat of water, we must farther assume, that, however
different the initial specific heats of the above three liquids may
be, yet, while they possess all the same rate of increase, water
alone has a different one; an inadmissible supposition, All
