5 Precautions. —Instead of entering fully into all the precautions necessary to be
aoary: in researches of the following description, we shall refer to the works of
SFarapay®, Marrevccarf and BecquertLt. We must however bear in mind that it
& is not the mere fact of getting an effect upon the needle of the galvanometer that is
& to satisfy us; that can be readily obtained : we have to point out to what class of phe-
6 nomena the effects may be referred,
3 As it appeared desirable to condense the experiments as much as possible, we
S hall make a few general remarks as to the mode in which the experiments were
a performed. The whole arrangement was ascertained to be in a good working con-
dition previous to each set of experiments. As an objection might be started to the
use of the former electrodes, two others were procured of platinum wire, No. 16 gauge,
each a foot in length, and from the same piece of wire.
