The conclusions (+) and (c) follow immediately from lemmas 2 and 3 respectively.

It will be noted that this theorem merely proves (in certain circumstances) the existence
of an infinity of solutions of the inequality (16) ; it gives no information about the distribution
of the solutions throughout the different parts of the body. In particular cases, more in-
formation can be obtained by direct application of lemmas 1, 2 or 3. We return to this point
in §4.

3. SOME FULLY REDUCIBLE STAR BODIES

All the star bodies which we mentioned on p. 313 as being bounded ly reducible are in
fact fully reducible. The method which will be used to prove this is a straightforward modi-
fication of that of Mahler, and rests on modified forms of theorems K and L, and definition
D of Mahler (19464). We denote these modified forms by accented letters. As before, we use
K® to denote, for any t>0, the bounded star body consisting of those points of K whose
distance from O does not exceed ¢.

THEOREM K’. Suppose the star body K is not fully reducible. Then there exists a critical lattice A
of K and an infinite sequence of lattices A,, Ay, ... such that

(a) A, ts admissible for K, but not for K;

(5) d(A,) <A(K);
