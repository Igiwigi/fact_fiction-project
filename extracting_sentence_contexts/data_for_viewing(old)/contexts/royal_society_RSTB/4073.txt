As a matter of fact a simple blood-contact in the centre of the right ventricular
cavity gives a low value (Dog G.Z., 070011 ; Dog H.B., —0°0027).*

Left Lining of the Septum.—These contacts are the most precarious of any. Of
three readings from the mid-septal region (—0-0036, —0°0085, 0°0066), two were
low values, the third relatively high. Small contacts introduced through the aorta
to test the region immediately beneath the aortic valves gave, in two animals,
readings of —0°0168 and 0:0022 respectively. The former is the lowest reading
we have obtained from any part of the heart. This is of interest, since from the
distribution of the Purkinje substance this is the region where we should expect
earliest activity. Directly below the valves the left division of the bundle appears
(Plate 9, fig. 22), and the rebranching begins almost immediately.
