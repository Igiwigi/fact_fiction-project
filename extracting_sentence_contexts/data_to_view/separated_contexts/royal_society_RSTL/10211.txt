The result of this is that the leaf shows two marginal weals,
which may be traced as continuous from the base to the apex (Plate 38, fig. 24). Starting from the base, it is found that the area of insertion of the leaf is semilunar,
with somewhat rounded corners ; a transverse section of the leaf a little higher up
shows a widening out of the corners as thin wings, and this increases upwards to &
certain point, becoming then again gradually reduced. There is in fact a sheathing
base to the young leaf of Cycas, which is produced by transverse dilatation through-
out the tissues of the base of the leaf, but especially localised near the two margins
(compare figs. 24 and 25). Tracing the marginal weals again upwards, they are found
to extend uniformly as smooth, rounded, parallel ridges to the apex of the young

leaf. 'The conformation of the whole phyllopodium from base to apex is fundamentally

uniform : speaking in a general sense, it is a winged 8ructure, the wings being a
8ubsequent development upon the more bulky central column (compare Osmunda). In connexion with the further development of the leaf, and the formation of the
pinnz, there are two questions to be decided : First, whether the pinne are formed
monopodially or by dichotomy of the apex of the phyllopodium ; and secondly, if
they are formed monopodially, what is the order of their development ?
