When a second film is sputtered on to well-developed crystals there are two
factors to be taken into account, (a) the greater mobility of the upper layer of the
new film and (#) the relative reluctance of a (111) surface to add atoms normally to
itself. On these lines the formation of new spherulets on top of the old crystal can
be understood. The fact that the edges of the large crystals often show bright between crossed
Nicols may possibly be interpreted to mean either that the first stage of the addition
of atoms to the crystal is the ordering of neighbouring atoms into crystalline
fibres normal to the surface, from which the tangential building up of the true
cubic lattice then takes place, or that the whole surface planes have a spacing
different from that of the planes in the bulk of the crystal. Alternatively, the
phenomenon may be due to polarization effects connected with scattering or

reflection at the edge. GENERAL CONSIDERATION OF RESULTS

There are a large number of earlier results on these films which have an interesting
bearing on the work described.
