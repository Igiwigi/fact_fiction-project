The following Table I. gives a list of the lines which appear upon the photographs,
together with references to the observations made by previous workers in the same
part of the spectrum.

It will be noticed that in the present photographs a number of lines appear which
were not described by Kayser and Rune as occurring in the are spectrum, though
most of them have been recorded by Eper and Vaxenta and Exner and HAscHEek
as spark lines. The difference between Kayser and Runer’s and the writer's lists is
to be looked for in the use of metallic poles instead of a carbon are fed with the
substance, and also perhaps in the current and voltage of the supply.

The fact that the majority of the lines which appear in the are under discussion
had previously only been found in the spark spectrum points to the insufficiency of
the terms “are” and “spark” lines to distinguish lines from one another, and indicates
that in the case of gold, as in that of iron*, “spark lines” [sic] may appear in the
spectrum obtained from an are source. The distinction implied by the terms “arc”
and “spark” lines cannot, therefore, be a general and rigorous one, however useful as
broad descriptive terms, but may have particular value when the current, dimensions
of the poles, and voltage of the supply are known in the one case, and the induction,
capacity, &c., in the other.
