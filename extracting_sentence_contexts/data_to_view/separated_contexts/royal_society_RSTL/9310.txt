But it turns out to be 80 (ﬆe Art. 77). And
what is more, these mean component velocities are the very velocities U, V, W, which
had been found to be necessary as already described. The recognition of this fact therefore removed all fundamental difficulty as regarded
the velocities U, V, W.

There still, however, remained the question as to whether the molecules might be
considered to arrive in all respects to the same degree of approximation as from the
same uniform gas—whether the molecules would arrive in respect to density from the
same uniform gas as in respect to mean velocity, &c. ; or whether severally in respect of
density, mean velocity, &c., the uniform gas would correspond to different values of s ? The answer to this question depends on the law of action between the molecules, and
hence it is of necessity left for such light as accrues from the experiments and other
known properties of gas. It is, however, now proved (not altogether from first principles, but on certain
elementary assumptions which might, it is thought, be deduced from first principles)
that as regards number the molecules will arrive at A as from a uniform gas having
the density, mean pressure and U, V, W, of the actual gas at a certain distance s
from A, and that as regards mean velocity, mean square of velocity, and mean cube
of yelocity, the molecules will arrive as from uniform gas corresponding in each respect
with the ane or another point.
