using the edge weight). The update schedule in the semi-synchronous algorithm is based on a
graph colouring such that no neighbouring nodes have the same colour. All the labels of the
vertices belonging to the same colour are updated at once, for all the colours in the network. Ties
can occur if there is more than one label with the same highest frequency between the neighbours
(this can happen, in particular, when considering unweighted networks). In the case of a tie, the
latter is resolved deterministically using a so-called Prec-Max method [62]: if the current label of
the node is among the labels with highest frequency, then do not change it; otherwise, choose the
label with the highest preassigned priority (for example, if each label is an integer number, give
priority to the largest number).

An example of the communities detected with LPA is shown in figure 1, where nodes with
the same colour belong to the same community. Notice that the algorithm is not provided with
any knowledge of the spatial relation among the nodes. In fact, it is completely model-agnostic,
in the sense that it is designed to work on arbitrary weighted graphs that may represent any sort
