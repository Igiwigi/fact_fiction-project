aspect of the head, dividing into branches named by OweEnt “external maxillary,”
3 “laryngeal,” “lingual,” “hyoid,” and “ internal maxillary ” ; from one of the branches or
2 from the main trunk twigs pass backwards in the neck to anastomose with set No. 2.
e Iti is important to notice that there is no clear subdivision into branches corresponding
% to external and internal carotids as in Mammals, but that vessels belonging to the
right and left sides, whose destination is the anterior end of the trunk, run forwards
& underneath the vertebral bodies in the same manner as the aorta passes backwards.
3 The subclavian arteries, from the extremities of the innominate stems, cross out-
: wards to the anterior limbs. The Jargest branch is distributed to the pectoral muscles,
= but, in addition, the internal mammary artery is given backwards, and in many cases
& a vessel is directed forwards to the ventral aspect of the trachea, and to the skin upon
the under-surface of the neck. No intercostal arteries are supplied. The subclavian
arteries are distinguished by this important fact, that in their course outwards they
pass ventral to the pneumogastric nerves and to the superior venze cave. In this they
differ very markedly from the vessels which in Mammals and Lacertilian Reptiles supply
the upper limbs, for these, after the manner of intercostal trunks, stretch outwards in
a position dorsal to both vein and pneumogastric nerve. In Crocodilian and Chelonian
Reptiles the relation of parts is similar to that found in Birds.
