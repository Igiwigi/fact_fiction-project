Herrwic, when experi-
menting on the reaction of developing embryos of Strongylocentrotus lividus to
high and low temperatures, discovered the important fact that the chromosomes
of cells which were produced at low temperatures might be two or three times larger
than those formed under warmer conditions. Probably this difference is to be
attributed to the more rapid succession of mitoses at the higher temperature, and
the consequent curtailment of opportunity for growth on the part of the chromosomes. Mors (1909) also drew attention to the fact that, during spermatogenesis in the

cockroach (Periplaneta Americana), the dimensions of the nuclei and of the
chromosomes are larger in the earlier than they are in the later spermatogonial
divisions. Conkuin (1912) compared the size of the chromosomes in the macromeres and
micromeres of Crepidula, and states “it is plain from the figures that the
chromosomes from the larger nuclei are larger than those from the smaller ones,
though the difference in the diameter and volumes of the chromosomes is not so great
as the difference in the volume of the nuclei from which they came.” He adds,
“just as the size of the nucleus is connected with the volume of the cytoplasm in
which it lies, so the size of the chromosomes is connected with the volume of the
nucleus from which they came.” This last cannot, however, be regarded as of
general validity ; for instance, the Primulas described above could hardly be brought
into line with it. Conxku1n also considers that nutritive conditions, such as are
supplied by the surrounding cytoplasm, have a direct influence on the size of the
chromosomes.
