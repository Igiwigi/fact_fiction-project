Before we compare the reconstructions of our specimen with those of other early
human embryos, it is perhaps advisable to explain briefly how the reconstructions of
embryos not directly available to us have been made. The reconstructions of the embryo “ Hugo” (Streve, 1926) (text-figs. 3 and 11) corre-
spond with those published by Frorran (1930, 6), and were constructed on the basis of
the figures of sections published in Strmve’s paper. As we (FLORIAN, 1930, 6) have
already shown, the embryo is not cut transversely, but obliquely ; the recognition of
this fact explains the asymmetry of the specimen (especially that of the primitive
streak) mentioned by Steve. The cloacal membrane, according to FLorran (1928, a,
p- 545; 1930, 6), is to be found in sections 60-62 (figs. 31-32 in Srmeve’s paper),
its connection with the endoderm being close to the point designated in Srreve’s
fig. 31 as “ Sichelknoten,” the connection with the ectoderm in fig. 32 being designated
as “ Blutinsel”” ; the connection between these two is present in section 61, the figure
of which was not published.
