or taking the logarithms of both sides of the equation,
log S=(7—t)s log e,

which expresses the fact the logarithms of the ratio of any two successive residues is
proportional to the corresponding interval. For calculation it is convenient to express
the equation in the deduced form

log log J_ log ('—t)= log «+ log log e. If, then, the differences between the corresponding values of log log 5 and log (7'—t) are

found to be constant within the errors of experiment, it may be presumed that the hypo-
thesis above tated is correct.
