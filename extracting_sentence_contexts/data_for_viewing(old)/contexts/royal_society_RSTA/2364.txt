All these differences highlight the importance of the numerous factors of influence on the
structural response of offshore lighthouses under wave actions: mode of construction and
materials, slenderness, partial lateral support provided by nearby rocks, and wave action itself
in terms of height, tide conditions, breaking mode, zone of application and pressures distribution
along the lighthouse tower.



Wavel, although significant in terms of wave height (total of 19m) mostly hit the base of the
La Jument lighthouse. Its crest is likely to have reached only the upper level of the reinforced
concrete ring with limited effect on the structural response of the tower.

Testimonies from archives [55] also support this fact. In a letter from 1930, following severe
storms, engineer Quemeneur stated (translated from French):

“... Dangerous oscillations for the optics take place only by severe storms from WNW to
South, in two different ways: 1) WNW to SSW: oscillations with very rough sea and when
waves pass minimum 3 to 4m higher than the top of the base platform. As long as waves
do not reach the platform, the lighthouse does not shake. As such, shakings are to fear
around high tide; (2) SSW to S: this is the most dangerous sector, although the sea is never
very rough from this side. Shakings seem to be due to the irregular shape of the bedrock
platform under the lighthouse, curved below the foundation and nearby a shoal where the
waves rise before hitting the lighthouse. Oscillations turn out to appear mostly at low tide,
with very strong wind, even if the sea is not furious, the swell passing or not above the base
platform...’.
