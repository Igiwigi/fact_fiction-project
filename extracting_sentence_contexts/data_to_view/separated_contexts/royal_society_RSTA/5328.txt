Various explanations have been suggested to account for the “head,” such as, Ist, ~
an excessive rainfall, accompanied by great cold; 2nd, the sliding of masses of snow ~
and ice over slopes; 3rd, waves of translation ; 4th, torrential fluviatile action during r
a period of great cold. I have stated in the paper referred to the objections to these —
several explanations. { Some of them, no doubt, would suffice to produce a portion of —
the observed effects, but they fail to embrace the whole, and they all involve conse-
quences which are incompatible with the general facts. They all, also, with one |
exception, depend on subaérial agencies, to which there is the general objection that
these agencies involve a certain amount of friction and weathering which are con-
spicuously wanting—or, if present, it is in a very slight degree—in the deposits —
under review. There is the further objection that some of the phenomena indicate —
the exercise of a propelling force for which the suggested causes are manifestly
inadequate.
