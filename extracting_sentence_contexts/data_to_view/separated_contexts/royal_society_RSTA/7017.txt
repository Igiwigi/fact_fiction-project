aniline in blends of Standard no. 4 fuel and DTD 230 base in benzene. Figure 29 shows
that with blends containing Standard no, 4 a content of only 25°% benzene is sufficient to
depreciate considerably the N-methyl aniline response. With DTD 230 base, on the other
hand, a content of up to 50°% benzene can be used without causing any loss in N-methyl
aniline response; in fact, there is a slight increase in response in terms of h.u.c.r. A charac-
teristic of the curves is that they appear to flatten off in the region of an h.u.c.r. of 10-0 to
10-5 regardless of the composition of the fuel. It seems probable, therefore, that above an
h.u.c.r. of about 10-3 the pressure-temperature conditions inside the combustion chamber
are such that most of the N-methyl aniline is destroyed before it can exert its anti-knock
