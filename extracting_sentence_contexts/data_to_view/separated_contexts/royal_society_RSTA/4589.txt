bifurcations. (Online version in colour.)

between them (as indicated by the vertical arrows). When the steering angle is decreased past the
saddle-node bifurcation point at 5 ~ 15Â°, the aircraft performs an outward spiral, as is shown by
(d), until an equilibrium at a larger circular trajectory is found. In fact, the inner or the nose-gear
tyres saturate, and then the particular tyres stay close to saturation, without any significant load
shift to any of the other gears. In the regions between the two Hopf bifurcation points, the equilibrium solution is unstable
and stable periodic solutions and even chaotic motion can be found. Increasing the steering angle
5 past the left-most Hopf bifurcation or decreasing it past the right-most Hopf bifurcation results
in the onset of (initially small) stable oscillations.
