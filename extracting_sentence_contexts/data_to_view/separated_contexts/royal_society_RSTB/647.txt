C. EWART ON THE ELECTRIC ORGAN OF THE SKATE. 405

in size and weight. By examining a series of sections from organs measuring from
6 inches (15°25 centims.) to 2 feet (61°75 centims.) in length, it was evident, first, that
the increase in size was due to an enlargement of the individual discs, and, second,
that, as the discs increased, the various layers, the nerve layer included, continued to
present the same histological characters as were found in the young fish—that, in fact,
the discs of the Skate were, from a structural point of view, as perfect from first to
last as the corresponding structures in the Torpedo. In the Torpedo, as life advances
the discs gradually increase in diameter but diminish in thickness, while the thickness
of the gelatinous insulating tissue between the discs is considerably augmented. Practically the same changes take place in the Skate.
