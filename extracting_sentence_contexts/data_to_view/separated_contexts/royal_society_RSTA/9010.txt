If mere collision between an electron
of the cathode stream and an atom or a component of an atom in the anti-cathode
resulted in the generation of X-rays, the resultant radiation consisting of all kinds
of pulses produced by random collisions would possess the properties of a mixture of
homogeneous radiations but without such a definite superior limit to the frequency of
its components as has been actually observed. The definite law indicates a definite
process, a process similar in essentials to that described in connection with the
production of the characteristic X-radiations. There is no reason to deny that what has usually been regarded as the method of
production of X-rays is inoperative ; the probability is rather that the electromagnetic
radiation generated in an anti-cathode by the random collision of the exciting cathode
particles is of small intensity; it does not constitute the bulk of the radiation
recognised as X-radiation, (Yet a complete theory must take account of the
experimental fact of a decided polarization in the primary beam—indicating an
