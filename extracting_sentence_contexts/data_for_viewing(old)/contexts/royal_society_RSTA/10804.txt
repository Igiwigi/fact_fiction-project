Development of the square-roots in powers of «* is useless on account of the slow
convergence, and it is required to find series which proceed by powers of «*, where
e=1l—k?

By a somewhat difficult investigation, in respect to which I owe my special thanks
to Mr. Hoxson, the needed series are found (§ 19).

It appears that portions of the two integrals involve logarithms which become
infinite when x vanishes. Since, in the application of these integrals, the vanishing
of « implies the vanishing of 8, we appear to be met by a difficulty. It is known
that in spheroidal analysis no such terms appear, and we may feel confident that
they cannot really exist in ellipsoidal analysis. In § 20 it is proved that the
logarithmic terms do as a fact disappear. The residues of the integrals in the cases
s = 1, 0 are thus found, and added to the previous portions to form the complete
results.

The second part of the paper ends (§ 22) with a list of the integrals of the squares
of the surface harmonies for all values of s, as far as the squares of £.

Finally, an appendix below contains a table of all the functions as far as 7 = 5,
s= 5. It is probable that for the higher values of s the results would only be
applicable when f is very small.
