108 MAJOR P, A. MacMAHON: MEMOIR ON THE

For the whole of the permutations derived as above from the lattice which are, in
fact, the whole of the permutations of «,°a,’«; we derive a permutation function
PF ( 0; 321),
such that the generating function sought is
er (2; 821)
(1)... (6)

and this we know otherwise to have the value
