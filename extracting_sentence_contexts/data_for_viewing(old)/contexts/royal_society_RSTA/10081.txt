The last row gives the mean values as found from Table I.

The larger comparative value obtained when the areas are obtained from photo-
graphs is clearly shown by the table. It would seem therefore that Wotr’s series
as a whole is more homogeneous than that obtained from the measurement of areas.
A second fact brought out by Table I. is that the ratios in the Greenwich series are
markedly higher at times of sunspot maxima. This shows that in Wour’s method of

counting, the sunspot activity is over-estimated when the activity is small, or under-
estimated when it is large. The direct measurement of areas derived from photo-
graphic records gives therefore a greater range of variability between the minimum
and the maximum, A further systematic difference will be pointed out in § 13. As
it was only necessary for my purpose to bring the different series into approximate
