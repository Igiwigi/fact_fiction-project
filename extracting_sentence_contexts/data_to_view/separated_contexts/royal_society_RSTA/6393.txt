This has led us to prefer models that seem to possess realism,
but interfere with our capacity to understand more elegant, and more theoretically generative,
simplifications that might speak to the nature of distributions. Consider the theoretical clarification that came after Queteletâ€™s development of the statistics
for social phenomena. He was struck by the fact that a predictable mathematical shape arose
in a population. He had made a reasonable stab at explaining the compatibility of this putative
lawfulness and free will, but his ideas could not but give rise to the notion, put forward by his
popularizer Henry Buckle, that, e.g. a certain number of people had to kill themselves, and if one
resisted the dark urges, another would find them all the more pressing. Even Emile Durkheim
was not free from this interpretation.
