of contact can take cognizance of them, except by adding new assumptions to those
already composing it (1874.). How, for instance, can it explain the powerful effects
of iron in suJphuret of potassium, or in potassa, or in dilate nitric acid; or of tin in
potassa or sulphuric acid ; or of iron, copper, tin, &c. in muriatic acid; or indeed of
any of the effects quoted? That they cannot be due to thermo contact has been
already shown by the results with inactive metals (1931. 1941.); and to these may
now be added those of the active metals, silyer and copper in dilute nitric acid, for
heat produces scarcely a sensible effect in these cases. It seems to me that no other
cause than chemical force (a very sufficient one) remains, or is needed to account for
them.

1957. If it be said that, on the theory of chemical excitement, the experiments prove
either too much or not enough, that, in fact, heat ought to produce the same effect
with all the metals that are acted on by the electrolytes nsed, then, I say, that that
does not follow. The force and other cireumstances of chemical affinity vary almost
infinitely with the bodies exhibiting its action, and the added effect of heat upon the
chemical affinity would, necesxarily, partake of these yariations. Chemical action
often goes on without any current being produced ; and it is well known that, in
almost eyery yoltaic circuit, the chemical force has to be considered as divided into
that which is local and that which is current (1120.). Now heat frequently assists the
local action much, and, sometimes, without appearing to be accompanied by any great,
increase in the intensity of chemical affinity ; whilst at other times we are sure, from
the chemical phenomena, that it does affect the intensity. of the force. The electric
current, however, is not determined by the amount of action which takes place, but
