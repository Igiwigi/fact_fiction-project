This splash was always irregular ; the liquid drifted to one
side where it would shear, while it disappeared from the other or became there too
thin to shear, though sufficient to fill up crevices.

Explanation of the Flutings. The fact thus established experimentally, that the surface of a smooth sphere must
be rigid if the film is to envelope it closely, suggests what seems a satisfactory
explanation of the flutings. For it suggests that, even while the film is exceedingly
thin, the flow is of the kind demanded by Portseuruun, in which the liquid next to the
solid has no motion relative to the solid, while the velocity farther away increases
with the distance from the surface. Since the sphere is descending while the film is
rising, there must be a strong viscous shear in the liquid impeding its rise.
