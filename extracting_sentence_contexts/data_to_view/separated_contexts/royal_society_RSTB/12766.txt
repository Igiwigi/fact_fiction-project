In addition to the fact that speciation may be cant, this may be a result of sample size. While we had
complete or almost complete in these species, there is strong reasonable sample sizes for each species (M. nervulosa =74,
evidence that speciation happened in situ on LHI. As in M. sclerocarpa = 39), these were not evenly distributed between
Howea, and for some other species on LHI, the fact that the sympatric and allopatric areas, and in particular, we only had

island, as well as the nearby sea stack Ballâ€™s Pyramid, have detailed survey would uncover differences.
