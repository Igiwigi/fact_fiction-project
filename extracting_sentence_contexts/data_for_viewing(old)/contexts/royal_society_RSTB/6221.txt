paper is based on about 8,900 separate weighings.) The only apparatus which is
suitable is a torsion balance, but as each instrument has a limited range it is important
to choose one which is appropriate to the work. We provided ourselves with one
weighing up to 80 mg, which is suitable for Glossina tachinoides ; we weighed a number
of tachinoides immediately after feeding, and none of them exceeded 54mg. But
if similar work is contemplated with morsitans or palpalis, it would be well to have a
machine weighing to 100mg. With such a machine one could only weigh to
0-2 mg which is not sufficiently accurate for dry weights, etc. ; it would be
necessary, therefore, to have a second machine with a maximum of 20 or 25 mg.
The dry weights, etc., quoted in the present paper are not accurate, for we could
not weigh beyond 0-1 mg which is about 3°%, of the dry weight of a fly or puparium.

In the statistical study of the facts we have received much valued help from our
colleague Dr. J. O. Irwin. The reader unfamiliar with elementary statistics may
misunderstand the phrase that the “‘ difference between the means is not statistically
significant.’ Statistical methods pay heed to the inconsistency or variation in the
original data from which the means are derived. If a difference is found to be
“ not statistically significant,”’ it means that it might occur, by chance, if the two
groups of individuals had been taken from the same population without being
subjected to different experimental treatment. In other words, one cannot be
certain that the difference is due to the experimental conditions, though it may be ;
the conclusion is not proved (though it may be very probable). But if a difference
is “ statistically significant,” this means that even when one has allowed for the
inconsistency in the data, the difference cannot be accounted for ; so that one feels
justified in attributing the difference to the experimental conditions.
