(b) Crude Oil tanker Prem Divya

The Aframax-class crude oil tanker Prem Divya (comparable oil tanker figure 4b) was built in
1998 and has a dead weight tonnage of 109 227 tons. It is a ship of the Indian company Mercator
Limited. It is powered by a slow-speed 2-stroke engine and the initial fuel consumption (shortly
after cleaning) at a reference speed of 11 knots is around 140 kg per nautical mile [48]. It was
decommissioned in 2012. Its total emission values as well as the calculated possible savings in the
three scenarios are given in electronic supplementary material, table S1. Our calculations showed
possible fuel savings of 5.07-20.28 kg and cost savings of 2.89 US$ to 11.56 US$ per nautical mile
in the three scenarios for the oil tanker.

For the Prem Divya, we calculated the figures for a fictional journey from Bahrein to Calcutta
of around 2700 nautical miles (one way). The calculated possible fuel savings for this journey
are between 13689.0 and 54756.0kg, meaning CO2-emission savings between 42846.6 and
171356.3kg and cost savings of 7802.7 US$ to 31210.9 US$. The detailed results for the three
scenarios are given in electronic supplementary material table S2.

(c) Container ships

The five identical container ships belong to the Postpanamax-Class (figure 4c) and remained
anonymous in the data source. They have a capacity of 8240 twenty-foot equivalent units and are


powered by a slow-speed 2-stroke engine with an average speed of 20.5 knots and an average fuel
