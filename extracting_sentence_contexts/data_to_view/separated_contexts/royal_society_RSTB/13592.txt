There are, however, certain similarities and potential instances
of convergent evolution that can provide models for the evol-
ution of human acoustic communication (see [6,89]). Vocal
learning, for example, seems to work in an analogous way in
songbirds and humans, including the prevalence of local dia-
lects and apparent individual differences [90]. In fact, bird
brain areas involved in vocal learning have been compared
to Broca and Wernicke regions of the human brain, as they acti-
vate when a bird hears or sings a song [91,92]. Furthermore, there are interesting parallels between
human music and language and vocal signals of other
animal species, particularly in instances where animal vocali-
zations have semantic- and syntax-like elements (for reviews,
see e.g. [93-95]). Interesting cases of semantic-like elements
(ie. calls that have symbolic functions) come from domestic
chickens, Gallus domesticus.
