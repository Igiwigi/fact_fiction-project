regards: this character, from the simpler
forms of Calcarina, than these last do from the very complex forms which have been
shown (©þ 197) to be connected with them by a. continuously gradational series. Hence
I cannot regard the remarkable development of the supplemental skeleton in Calcaring
as affording any disproof of the idea of its genetic relationship to Rotalia, to which its
affinity in every other particular is most intimate.

250. If, again, we inquire into the import of that remarkable development of the
canal-syslem, which seems to be the distinctive feature of Polystomella, we find that if
we base our judgment upon a sufficiently wide foundation of facts, its non-essential
character becomes apparent. For although the large P. craticulata of the tropical and
Anustralian seas presents the most symmetrical and extensive distribution of the canal-
system that I have anywhere met with (|< 187-191), the. little P. erispa of our own
seas exhibits but feeble traces of it (| 192); yet of the intimacy of their relationship
no doubt can be fairly entertained.
