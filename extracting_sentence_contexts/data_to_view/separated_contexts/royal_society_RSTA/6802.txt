For example, the point, line, plane, ..., [/] of such a
nest originating in a single point of contact d, of index e = +1 prove to be the point of
contact, tangent line, osculating plane, ..., osculating [|p] of a rational normal curve
of order e. This curve which lies on # is contained by that space [e] which is defined
by the [/] and the external point a, of A. In fact, the points [x’, y’] given by the e+ 1 successive rows of

(1)

form such an osculating system for the curve
Filoc{a+0, avo, ..., av+avPtl, 0, ..., 0; 1, v, ..., v4, 0, ..., O}. This is a rational normal curve of order e with parameter v and fixed a. The values of P,
aL /dv, 30°1'/dv", etc., at v = 0 give the points represented by the successive rows of (1).
