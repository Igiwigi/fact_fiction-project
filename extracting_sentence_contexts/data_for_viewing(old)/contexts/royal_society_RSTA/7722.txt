frequency smaller than vy = v, — vy. Furthermore, since the points v, + v. and
v; — v2 in the frequency scale are associated with a relatively large number of
normal vibrations, we should expect maxima of the absorption (and reflexion) at
these frequencies.

This is, roughly speaking, what one does find from the calculation of the one-
dimensional case; in the two- and three-dimensional case the effects are more
complicated but the same general principles apply. It is perhaps as well to state
which of the general results quoted apply to all crystals and which are of special
nature.

The first point concerns the fall of the absorption on the short wave-length side
of the maximum. This effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum
of a crystal has a finite upper Timit, and that the spectrum of the combination tones
has a similar upper limit. Hence the effect should appear in all polar crystals.

The existence of an absorption continuum is a result of the existence of a more
or less continuous vibrational spectrum, and is, as such, a general effect. The
maxima in this continuum due to the splitting up of the frequency branches can
be taken to be practically as general an effect, though in particular cases they
might not be noticeable. The size of the continuum may vary greatly from crystal
to crystal. As an example, we may note the fine structure of the 6-8». reflexion
maximum found by PLytert for CaCO . Besides the two maxima usually attri-
buted to the vibrations of the carbonate ion, there are two other maxima at present
unexplained. These lie on each side of one vibration, and their distances from the
