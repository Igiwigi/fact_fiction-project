of the crack within mutual range by thermal agitation, but it is unlikely that this
can happen save in the case of very small cracks.

Tf this theory is correct, it appears at first sight that the phenomenon of fatigue
failure must be confined to substances which contract on decrystallising. This, however

is not necessarily so. If, for instance, a small thickness of material at the interface
between two crystals were to increase in volume, it could not be said without proof
that tensile stresses would not be set up thereby, in addition to compressions. In
some cases, in fact, it is obvious that there must be tensions. Thus, if the outer layer
of a sphere increases in volume, the matter inside must be subjected to a tensile stress.

The effect of overstrain on the density of metals is at present under investigation
at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. The work is not yet sufficiently complete for
detailed publication, but it may be mentioned here that the expected change in density
has been found, and that the results already obtained are such as to leave little room
for doubt that this change is in fact the cause of fatigue failure in metals. Thus, in
overstraining mild steel by means of a pure shearing stress, a decrease in average
density of as much as 0-25 per cent. has been observed.

Some progress has also been made in the direction of estimating the internal stresses
set up as a result of the change in density, and it has been found that an average change
