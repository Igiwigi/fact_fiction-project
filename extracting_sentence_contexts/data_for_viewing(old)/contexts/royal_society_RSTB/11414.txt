similarity with the objects or events they refer to.’ In fact,
simulations are not arbitrary signs, i.e. they are not symbols,
nor they can be classified as indexes (they do sometimes also
imply a spatio-temporal contiguity with the object or event
they refer to, but this is not the norm nor it is an essential
feature, as simulation routines can be triggered also by ima-
gined objects, facts and events or even, to a certain degree,
by their linguistic descriptions) [26]. Simulation routines are
the ground for similarity relations that depend only on the
qualities of the simulations themselves, i.e. they depend on
structural characteristics of the simulations. Most impor-
tantly, as it is the case for icons, simulation routines can be
considered filtered signs. In fact, they are not actions or per-
ceptions that a subject is currently carrying out nor are they
their exact copies. Simulations are the abstract and schematic
enactment of features that identify an action or event, inde-
pendently of any specific movement or sensory-motor
contingency that might be involved in it. To come back to
the example briefly sketched in the previous section on the
abstract character of the mechanism of simulation, Umilta
et al. [46] showed that both macaques’ ventral premotor and
primary motor cortices contain neurons able to code the


goals (i.e. an abstract schematization) of motor actions inde- and tactile areas respond to vision and audition). Let us 6 |
