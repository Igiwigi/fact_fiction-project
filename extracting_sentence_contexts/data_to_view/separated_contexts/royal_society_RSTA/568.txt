In its
aftermath, Japan spent over US$600M (in 1998) to build an 11 m high seawall, to rebuild the main
town of Aonae, and to protect about 20 km of coastlines. Even so, its population dwindled from
4679 in 1993 to 3160 in 2012 [26]. The fact that Japan spent an average of approximately US$130K per Okushiri resident
expressed a commitment to tsunami hazard mitigation, which unfortunately the 11 March 2011
underscored as not having been uniformly applied elsewhere. To wit, we are reminded of the
Kamaishi breakwater, a pharaonic structure protecting Kamaishi, where no NPPs are located. Built at a cost of nearly US$1.5B, after more than three decades in construction, it was the largest
and deepest breakwater in the world, and was located 215 km from Fukushima Dai-ichi (figure 1)
and largely crumpled under the tsunami [27].
