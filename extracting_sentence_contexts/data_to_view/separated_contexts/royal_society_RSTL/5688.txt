On the other hand, it has been

denied by HALLER, MORGAGNI, BoyER, SABATIER, CHAUSSIER, PROCHASKA, Vice D'AzyR,
Duxas, Bicxar, RoLaNDo, MuxRo, DESMOULINS, and more recently by STILLINGS. At
the present day the balance of opinion is decidedly in fayour of a decussation, although
the late microscopical researches of STILLING may have added some weight to the oppo-
site 8ideh. I am prepared, however, to place the fact beyond all possibility of doubt;
for a cursory inspection of my preparations is sufficient to show that a complete and
complicated decussation actually takes place. But still the real composition and ele-
mentary structure of the pyramids, as I shall now proceed to show, has not hitherto
been accurately described. (10.)
