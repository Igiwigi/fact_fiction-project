The posterior Tract.

To obtain a distinct view of the whole extent of the posterior tract, we require to
have the parts carefully prepared +. It will be very convenient to have the crura, pons,

* The terms pons and nodus are sufficiently intelligible and harmless, as implying no theory ; I retain the
old names unless the new ones be countenanced by the just eminence of the authors who have invented them,

and medulla oblongata detached from the great masses of the cerebrum and cerebel-
lum, s0 that they may lie before us. We should first mark out and trace the columns
of the spinal marrow ; observing the corpora restiformia as they come down from
the cerebellum, we may split them at the posterior fissure and fold them aside.

We now survey the extent of the fourth yentricle. On each side of the calamus
scriptorius are two pyramidal columns*. To trace these upwards we must cut into
