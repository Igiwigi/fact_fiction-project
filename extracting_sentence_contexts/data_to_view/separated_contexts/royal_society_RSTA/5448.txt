While some scalar reaction-diffusion
equations can admit non-constant equilibrium solutions, these do not arise as a direct interaction
of nonlinear reactions and diffusion alone, but require other ingredients. Classic results show
that scalar quasi-linear reaction-diffusion equations with homogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions in convex domains do not admit non-constant stable equilibria, even if temporally
forced [13-15]. In fact, such non-existence of patterns has been shown for a large class of
competitive and cooperative systems in convex domains [16]. Bistable equations in non-convex
domains have been shown to exhibit stable non-constant solutions [17], as have bistable equations
with Dirichlet or inhomogeneous boundary conditions [4,18]. Such solutions do not have the
same qualitative features as patterned states in reaction-diffusion systems, or scalar equations
with more general transport operators, which we focus on for the rest of this review.

(a) Linear instability of reactionâ€”diffusion systems

The standard setting for a Turing instability is the two-component system,

where u,v denote morphogen concentrations, D,,,D, >0 diffusion coefficients, f,g reaction
kinetics, and the domain 2 C R" is usually taken to be a compact domain with sufficiently smooth
boundary, such as a line for n = 1 or a disc for n = 2.
