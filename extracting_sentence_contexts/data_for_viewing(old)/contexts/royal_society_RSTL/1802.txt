thick. Ten pairs of these, excited by extremely dilute nitric
acid, caused a rapid rotation in mercury, interposed under
sulphuric acid between the poles, and a regular advance of

phznomena. The $sluggish electricity of a-single pair of plates may be compared
to air, rendered dense and less elastic by excessive cold, while the active charge of
a powerful battery, or the spark of an ordinary electrical machine, is in this view
assimilated to air with all its energies exalted, and its density diminished by violent
heat. The same quantity in weight may pass through the same conducting pipe in
the same time ; but in the one case the motion of each molecule will be compara-
tively much slower, and the actual quantity present at any instant of the discharge
(c. g- an inch in length) of the conductor, much greater than in the other, I am
well aware that this is merely an analogical representation of facts, and of course in-
accurate, but it seryes to explain the distinction in the text.

with the liquid in the cells, in which case the surface exposed
by each pair to the action of the acid could not exceed 2; of
