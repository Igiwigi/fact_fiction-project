214, Dr. CurrIE's Account of the

the heart pulsated with great steadiness and due force. In
the last experiment, when the heat sunk rapidly, SuTToN aid
that he felt a coldness and faintness at his stomach, which he
had not perceived before, and when I felt the motion of his
heart, it was feeble and languid. In some future trials of the
effects of immersion in fresh water (one of which I shall de-
tail), the same coldness at the stomach preceded a rapid fall
of the mercury; and these facts, together with the effects I
found from applying a considerable heat to this part when the
body was chilled with cold, convince me that there is some
peculiar connection of the stomach, or of the diaphragm, or
both, with the process of animal heat. Whoever will consider
the rapidity with which a dead body would have cooled im-
mersed in water of the temperature of 40*, may form some es-
timate of the force with which the process of animal heat must
have acted in the experiments already recited. These expe-
riments, however, furnish irrefragable proofs of the futility of
some of the theories of animal heat.
