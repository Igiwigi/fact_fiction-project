The residue from a petroleum-ether extract did not give a distineb colour change
with iodine in iodide of potassium, it became green with nitric acid, and a less distinet |
green with sulphuric acid. In other cases the greenish colour with iodine was better

marked.

The occurrence of the one-banded lipochrome in the enterochlorophyll of Ostres is
the rule, as other experiments taught, and it is very difficult, to separate it from the
green constituent ; 8till, although a complete separation of the yellow from the green
constituent cannot be easily accomplished by saponification, ib is quite evident thab
the enterochlorophyll of Ostrea is composed of these constituents, and bears a most
remarkable resemblance to plant chlorophyll and to that of Spongilla, differing
slightly in the fact that it is more decomposed by saponifying than either and in a
different manner,* : :

I saponified an alcohol extract of the liver of Heliz pomatia by the same method.
Tust as in the case of Ostraa and Spongilla the green constituent went into the
petroleum-ether, giving a band in red from X 672 to X 657, also a lipochrome band
from A 503 to X 482-5, and the other 8olutions only contained decompoxsition-products
of the green constituent mixed with the yellow. This enterochlorophyll was much
changed by the saponification, and, like that of Ostraa, contained a one-banded
lipochrome.

The remaining experiments on the saponification of enterochlorophyll were carried
out, on that of starfighes and Mytilus, and owing to greater abundance of material
