off. The next CODATA value for G will likely need to have larger error bars’. This is exactly
the point which I have been trying (unsuccessfully) to make now for some years. (I recognize
that some might choose to dismiss my view on this issue claiming that I too am human, and
that my opinion is probably clouded by self-interest.) Nevertheless, I do have quite a bit of
respect for the precision measurement experience of those groups whose determinations fall
in these ‘outlying’ G determinations. Accordingly, I believe that it would be quite reasonable
to admit to the metrological community that things here are not nearly as tidy as we wish
they were; and that G might in fact be somewhat higher (or lower) than that suggested by
CODATA’s 2010 recommended uncertainty for this particular fundamental constant which ‘is
too hard to measure’.

9. Benedictory remarks

I would lastly conclude with a few thoughts which I hope you will carry with you long after you
have finished reading this paper. First, the subject matter at hand is that of precision measurement,
not precision measurements with an s, because big G determinations and all other precision
measurement experiments share a common knowledge base. Simply put, all of these experiments,
which at first glance may appear different, are at heart similar. This allows one to draw on the
over-a-lifetime generated and ever-evolving skill set which is needed to successfully work in this
field.
