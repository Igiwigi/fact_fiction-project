FARADAY'S EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY.

produced by the making and breaking contact, and their separation by an inter-
mediate and indifferent” state, this separation is probably more apparent than real. If the conduction of electricity be effected by vibrations, or by any other mode in
which opposite forces are snccessively and rapidly excited and neutralized, then we
might expect a peculiar and contrary development of force at the commencement and
termination of the periods during which the conducting action should last (somewhat
in analogy with the colours produced at the outside of an imperfectly developed solar
spectrum) : and the intermediate actions, although not sensible in the same way, may
constitute the very essence of conductihility. It is by views and reasons such as these,
which seem to me connected with the fundamental laws and facts of electrical science,
that I have been induced to enter, more minutely than I otherwise should have done,
into the experimental examination of the phenomena described in this paper.

1116. Before concluding, I may briefly remark, that on using a voltaic battery of
fifty pairs of plates instead of a single pair (1052.), the effects were exactly of the
same kind. The spark on making contact, for the reasons before given, was very
small (1101. 1107.); that on breaking contact, very excellent and brilliant.
