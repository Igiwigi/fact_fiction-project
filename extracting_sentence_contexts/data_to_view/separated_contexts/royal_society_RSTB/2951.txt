Section 20.—Critical Velocity for Stream-line Flow in Wood Vessels. PorsEvILLe’s formula for the flow of liquid through tubes only applies when the
motion takes place in straight lines. If the speed is high the motion becomes
turbulent, and the resistance increases as a power of the speed, rising to 1'8 or 2.

* A point of some interest in this connection lies in the fact that the modulus of elasticity varies much
less than the breaking strain in different woods, and even in the wood of the poplar, the same is shown,
though to a less degree. Thus :—
