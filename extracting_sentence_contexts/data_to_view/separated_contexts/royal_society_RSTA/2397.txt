In many situations, the effective computational


power of RC has been found comparable, or in some cases even better than, their standard RNN
counterpart. One major technological challenge of neuromorphic computing is however to imagine and
design a physical hardware implementing its specific concepts, instead of translating them into
algorithms to be programmed in standard, however structurally unmatched, digital processors. The generally recognized poor energy efficiency of artificial intelligence (involving dedicated
supercomputers, or energy greedy computer farms) is indeed related to the fact that brain
computing concepts have to be adapted into Turing von Neumann machines, whose architecture
and principles of operation are actually very far from what we have learned from the brain. Up to now, there is essentially no other easily available and dedicated computing platform
capable of efficiently running artificial intelligence techniques. Turing von Neumann machines
are practically the only effectively working solution today for investigating AI.
