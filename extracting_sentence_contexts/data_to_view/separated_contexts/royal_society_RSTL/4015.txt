These communications of Messrs. LEREBouss, Foucaulr and F1zeav, led Dr. Dra-
PER to write a letter, published in the Philosophical Magazine of February last, re
peating his observations on the spectrum of Virginia, adding several other analogous
facts confirming the theory of a protecting and even destroying action exercised by
the least refrangible rays. Dr. Dares, in the same letter, said that the rays which
protect the plate from ordinary photogenic action are themselves onpeble, when
isolated, of producing a peculiar photogenie effect.
