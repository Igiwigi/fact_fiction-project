ACCOUNT OF THE DEVONIAN FISH, PALASXOSPONDYLUS GUNNI, TRAQUAIR. 285

A glance at these data is sufficient to show the laws of growth as represented by
Dr. Basurorp-Dray’s table of percentages are the result of an illegitimate method
of comparison. The fact that one specimen with a cranium measuring 3°9 millims.
in length is provided with a vertebral column only 9:1 millims. long, while another
with a head 3°96 millims. in length possesses a vertebral column 19°04 millims. long,
does not illustrate a law of growth, but rather the danger of trusting to measurements
made on specimens only superficially exposed to view. The smallest specimen in the
table is represented by a figure (23, Plate 1, fig. 9) in Dr. Basnrorp-Dran’s Memoir,
which shows nothing but the vertebral column or a part of it, without any indication
of a head ; to draw important conclusions from so obscure and insignificant a fragment
appears to us hazardous in the extreme; still more to make it the subject of
measurements for comparison, Our own smallest specimen has a total length of
14:0 millims. measured from the front margin of the ampyx to the extremity of the
vertebral column, which may not be complete; the length of the head between the
front margin of the ampyx and a line joining the posterior margin of the postero-lateral
masses is 2°5 millims.
