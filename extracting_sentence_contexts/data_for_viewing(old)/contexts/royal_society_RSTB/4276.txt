teristics of the Mammalian hard palate are exhibited without the secondarily acquired
Marsupial fenestration.

The pterygoids in Perameles are much reduced in size ; in fact, in the young stages
they are mere flakes of bone on the ventral side of the much-enlarged processus basi-
pterygoideus of the ala temporalis. However, in the later stages (fig. 21), in spite
of the reduction in size, the pterygoids exhibit a tendency to form a plate over the
ventral surface of the sphenoid. They also retain their old articulation with the
palatines. Both of these may be regarded as ancient characteristics, which are
retained by the more primitive of Mammals.

The articulation of the exoccipitals and the atlas is also of interest, owing to she
fact that articulation is continuous between the condyles. The confluence of the optic
foramen with the foramen lacerum anterius is in itself an indication of the Reptilian
ancestry of the Marsupialia, It is a condition which is to be observed only in the
lower Mammals.

(b) Comparison with the Prototheria.

The skull of Perameles, as depicted in the sections available for examination,
occupies in many ways an intermediary position, in point of view of development,
between those of Trichosurus and Dasyurus. Therefore, in several respects, there
are fewer differences to be observed between the skulls of Echidna and Perameles
than between Hehidna and Trichosurus.
