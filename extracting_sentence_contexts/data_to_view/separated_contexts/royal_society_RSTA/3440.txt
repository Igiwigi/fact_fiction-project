The first involves an adaptation to the seismological context [7,38—40] of a
known ‘flash-heating’ mechanism of weakening at high slip rates in metal-on-metal friction [41-
44]. That is summarized in figure 1, and involves the rapid heating and weakening of frictional
asperity contacts between sliding surfaces of, essentially, coherent rock, as discussed in the next
section. The other major stream relies on the fact that shear zones are often zones of finely granulated
material and, being (for the situations considered here) zones that lie within Earth’s crust, it is
frequently the case that such zones are fluid-infiltrated. Thus, we must be concerned with the
thermal pressurization of native ground fluids by frictional dissipation (e.g. [47-55]) raising p
towards oy and hence weakening the shear strength t. The earlier of those studies represented
the fault as a saturated granulated layer of uniform thickness, say , separating blocks of coherent
rock that were non-deforming and unable to conduct heat or pore fluid.
