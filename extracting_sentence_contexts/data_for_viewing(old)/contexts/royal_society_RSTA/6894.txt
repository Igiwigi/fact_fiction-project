is zero, but this result needs closer examination because the crest is a singular point (see
later). The second requires dp/dy to be zero with the same reservations with regard to a
singular point. Once again, the equation of motion at the moment of greatest height gives
(68) as the criterion of greatest height.

We have now reached the position that if there is some amplitude of the wave such that
at the crest at its greatest height the downward acceleration equals g, any attempt further
to increase the wave height results in a loss of permanent form. The crests break up and the
periodicity is destroyed. There is, however, no a priori reason why such a situation should
ever arise. The amplitude might indefinitely increase and the period indefinitely increase
in such a manner that the downward acceleration never does become equal to or greater
than g. Our equations to the fifth order give strong presumptive evidence that there is in
fact a limiting wave height.

The numerical value of A in the stationary wave of maximum amplitude may be obtained
from (68), using our earlier expressions for ©. There are two reasons why it is necessary to
go to high-order harmonics in order to get reasonable numerical accuracy. The first is
that (68) involves a double differentiation of ©, thus giving an amplification by n? of the
nth harmonics in the expression for the wave profile (compared with only an amplification
by x in the Stokes-Michell progressive wave problem, where the limiting amplitude is
obtained from a slope, requiring only a single differentiation). The second unfavourable
circumstance is that the maximum value of A is approximately 50°% greater than that for
the progressive waves.

At the crests, we have from (14) that
