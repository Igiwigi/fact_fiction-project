Thevenin
identified his largest Madagascar fragment with Dumortier’s species, but intermediate
material from Arabia shows that the Madagascar fragment is merely the outer half-whorl
of a full-grown madagascariense. Specific identity with the European form cannot be
claimed in ignorance of the inner whorls of crassifalcatus (Dumortier says nothing of
a bisulcate tricarinate venter) and in view of the considerably less simplified septal suture
shown on Dumortier’s figure. Thevenin himself, in fact, rightly pointed out that his
specimen is more evolute than Dumortier’s and might prove to be only a variety of
P. madagascariense. It also reaches the unicarinate stage earlier than A. crassifalcatus. The only other possible close comparisons for Harpoceras madagascariense are with the
genus Protogrammoceras Spath (1913, p. 547).
