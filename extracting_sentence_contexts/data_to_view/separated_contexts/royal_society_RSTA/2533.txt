Thus, ‘an intuitive version of mathematical induction’ allows one

to see that for any n, the number of squares in the nth row will be n. Therefore, calculating :8

"i requires calculating the total number of squares in the diagram, which is n?/2 + n/2, Ss
by the formula for the area of a triangle plus the number of squares supplied by the shaded : =
half-squares. 7

Note that Chihara’s suggested induction does not lead directly to the theorem: rather, it leads : a
to the result that )>/"_, i is the number of squares in the diagram with n rows. Put another way, : =
Chihara’s induction shows that the diagram (3.1) can be extended to any number of rows 1 : =
without changing the fact that its area is )~'' , i. It is from this statement that the result is then 1B
deduced. By contrast, the non-spatial induction leads directly to the result.
