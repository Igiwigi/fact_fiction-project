of air dragged by the sides of a cylinder of this diameter, according to its
thickness: but which does not appear to be yery regular in its march ; since
the thin cylinders drag more in proportion than the thicker ones. Till this
fact is more fully ascertained, we cannot deduce a correct general formula for
determining the quantity of air dragged by cylinders of different diameters
and thicknesses, 8wung in the manner above mentioned.

The next set of experiments were made with thin circular discs of brass,
having about the same thickness as common thick post paper. Twenty
pieces, screwed together in a vice, measured *08 inch ; consequently the thick-
ness of each of the brass discs may be assumed equal to 004 inch. One of
these discs was intended to be 2:06 in diameter, in order to correspond with
the cylinders above mentioned ; but it is in fact somewhat larger, being 207 ;
and weighs 28 grains : the second was 3-01 inches in diameter, and weighed
57-5 grains: and the third was 4 inches in diameter, and weighed 106-5
grains. Their specific gravity I found to be 8:450. The long brass rod above
mentioned* was then tapped with a screw hole at 38 inches from the knife
edge, and the three discs, in succession, were respectively fastened thereto ;
and swung with their flat sides opposed to the line of motion. The long steel
rod could not be used on this occasion, not only because the discs could not
be conveniently attached thereto, but also on account of its coming to rest
80 800N,

* This was the 8econd brass rod, 56'9 inches long, mentioned in the second note in page 441,
