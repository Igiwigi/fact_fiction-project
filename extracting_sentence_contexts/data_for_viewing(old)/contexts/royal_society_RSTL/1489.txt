II. Some Facts relative to the late Mr. John Hunter's prepa-
ration for the Croonian Lecture. By Everard Home, Esq.

Read November 14, 1793.

Ms. Hoxren having announced to the Royal Society that
he would make the structure of the crystalline humour of the
eye the subject of the CRooNn1an lecture for the present year,
and having, unfortunately for science, died before his observa-
tions on that subject were rendered complete, I feel it a duty
I owe to his memory, as well as to the Society, to state the
facts respecting this humour with which he had acquainted
me; and shall subjoin an unfinished letter from Mr. HunTER
to Sir Jostru Banks on the same subject.

It is now many years that Mr. HunTER has had an idea,
that the crystalline humour was enabled by its own internal
actions to adjust itself, so as to adapt the eye to different dis-
tances ; and when the Tuna bydatigena first came under his
observation as a living animal, he was surprised to see the
quantity of contraction that took place'in a membrane devoid
of muscular fibres, but made use of the fact in his investiga-
tion of the structure of the crystalline humour of the eye.
