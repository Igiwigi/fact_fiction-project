N. LOCKYER ON THE PHOTOGRAPHIC

involved in uncondensed nebulous matter. Hence, another possible condition
the hottest stars is satisfied by the photographic facts at our disposal. rh

It will be seen then, that these considerations of the conditions of increasing ten
rature demanded by the hypothesis, have enabled us to determine that the sei
spectra represented in Plates 26 and 27 is in all probability a series in ascending ord
of temperature. All the phenomena we should expect, on the hypothesis, are m
with among the spectra of celestial bodies. We have next to consider the phenomena connected with stars of decreas
temperature.
