111. A limited depth of fluid is by no means necessary to produce crispa-
tions on the surface (73). A circular glass basin about five inches in diameter
and four inches deep was attached to a lath (69), filled with water and vibrated,
the exciting rod being applied at the side (71). The surface of the water was
immediately covered with the most regular crispations, i. e. heaps arranged
quadrangularly. On taking out part of the water and filling it up with oil,
the oil assumed the same superficies. On putting an inch in depth of mer-
cury under the water, the mercury became crispated. The experiment was
finally made with water fourteen inches in depth. Particles at a very moderate
depth in the water seemed to have no motion except the general motion of the
fluid, and the whole of the lower part of the water may be considered as per-
forming the part of a solid mass upon which the superficial undulating portion
reposed. In fact it matters not to the fluid, what is beneath, provided it has
sufficient cohesion, is uniform in relation to the surface fluid, and can transmit
the vibrations to it in an undisturbed manner *,

112. The beautiful action thus produced at the limits of two immiscible
fluids, differing in density or some other circumstances, by which the denser
was enabled most readily to accommodate itself to rapid, regular and alternating
displacements of its support when that support was horizontal, suggested an
inquiry into the probable arrangement of the fluid when the displacements
were lateral or even superficial.

lower extremity dipped about one third of an inch into water, fig. 27,
