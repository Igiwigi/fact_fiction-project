In contexts such as climate risk management, where greater uncertainty is often :
associated with greater expected damages [15], this could lead to costly failures to act [16]. This article focuses on the communication of uncertainty in seasonal and interannual climate
forecasts. As with other model-based prediction systems, uncertainty in climate forecasts comes
from both the probabilistic nature of the forecast, and the fact that the models used to make
these forecasts do not have perfect reliability [17]. Hence, users must be aware of both types
of uncertainty, if they are to make informed decisions about whether or not to use seasonal
or interannual forecasts, and—if so—how to use them in their decision-making. However, the
complex ways in which climate scientists represent uncertainty may not be well understood by
users, or provide them with the information they need to make decisions.
