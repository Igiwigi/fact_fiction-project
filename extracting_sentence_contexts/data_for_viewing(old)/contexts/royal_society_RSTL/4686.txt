By reflecting on certain facts connected with the respiratory movements, and which
seem to derive no explanation from our actual knowledge of the structure of the
spinal chord, I was induced to undertake a series of observations with the view of
determining, if possible, the relations which appear to subsist between the spinal
nerves and the respiratory nervous centres. These observations, however, led me
into a more extended inquiry than I at first contemplated, the results of which I now
venture to lay before the Royal Society.

It is needless to point out the difficulties which attend, not only the minute investi-
gation, but a clear and connected description, of a structure s0 intricate and delicate
as that of the spinal chord. It may be proper however to state, with regard to the
contents of this paper, that those facts only which were verified by cautious and re-
peated examination have been brought forward with confidence ; while in cases where
