tetrahedra, and if so they may be associated with the mechanism for NTE. However, our ab initio
lattice dynamics calculations [49] suggest that the RUM description of the phonon dynamics
is actually not appropriate, which is explained by the fact that the shortest Cu---Cu inter-
tetrahedral distances are the same as the Cu---Cu intra-tetrahedral distances. The structure is
simply too-closely packed to permit RUM flexibility. Actually it also turned out that there is
greater rigidity associated with the linear O-Cu-O linkage [49].

Finally, we consider two related materials that show NTE, ZrW2Og [50] and Y2W3Q 2 [51].
These both contain corner-linked octahedra (ZrOg and YOg¢) and tetrahedra (WO,). Analysis of
the phonons by ab initio lattice dynamics calculations suggest that in both cases the low-frequency
dynamics are associated with rigid body motions of the WO, tetrahedra, and that the Zr-O bonds
are relatively stiff, but that there is allowed bending of the octahedral bond angles [52,53]. Here,
I point out the important fact that in the general case (perovskites being the exception) systems
consisting of octahedra within the network will be over-constrained and no RUMs are possible
[54]. ZrW2Og is in principle allowed to support RUMs because one of the vertices of each WO4
tetrahedra is not connected within the network [55]. I will make further remarks about ZrW2Og
below (84d).

(c) Flexibility in metal-organic frameworks

The issue of analogous RUM flexibility in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has hardly been
explored, but one simple system that has been studied—Zn(CN),—might point to some
interesting warnings. I introduced the fact that there are 8 RUMs per wave vector earlier (§2)
[21,22]. Of these, two are transverse acoustic modes, three are optic modes involving transverse
displacements of the CN ligands from the Zn—CN-Zn linkage, and three are optic modes
