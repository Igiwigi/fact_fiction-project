MR. A. CAYLEY'S FIFTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 453

putting for shortness
4 == A?+B2?+ C2?
=? (B=0(C—ANA—B)
we have
' M=43(A*+B*+C?)A?;
and it is then easy to deduce

#=A(B—C)
7,=A(C—A)
T=A(A—B);
in fact, these values give
= 7 += +=; =
AS 37+ 70, +9,o,= — M

S T,T,T,; == 1M,

- and they are consequently the roots of the equation a%— M(@—1)=0.

= 142. The leading coefficient of TH—=,JU is then equal to a* into the following
> Eexpres8ion, Viz.

S (AB +CO)a(ac—Þ)—z4;(A*+B*+C&)(B—C).
