Banpacz and Mr. HenscaL, and they are sufficiently
explanatory. In the case of magnetic energy induced in a body by any of
the ordinary methods, it may be observed as a general fact, that the energy
is acquired in somewhat less time than that in which it is again lost. This is
particularly the case in soft iron rendered magnetic, by an electro-magnetic
spiral; a simple contact between a magnet and a mass of soft iron will fre-
quently convey to it an attractive force, which it retains for a comparatively
long space of time. In regard to the susceptibility of different substances, it
is found to vary considerably; and depends on some peculiar property not yet
explained ; it seems to be in some-inyerse ratio of their retentive power.
