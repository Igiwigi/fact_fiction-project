The question is whether
these categories are “ independent ” (FisHEer, 1932, p. 87), or not. The matter may be tested by y?, and it can be shown that the differences between
44 and 11% could not reasonably be attributed to chance, either for submorsitans
(figures above) or for tachinoides (Table V) ; the difference between tachinoides at
44 and 19% are not significant (é.e., they might or might not be due to chance). But when all the facts are considered, the effect of humidity on the birth-rate may
be regarded as proved. The information given in Tables V and VI suggests several questions of interest. It will be observed that even at the most favourable humidity the value of b is between
two and six, the mean for tachinoides being 2-85 and for submorsitans 4-62.
