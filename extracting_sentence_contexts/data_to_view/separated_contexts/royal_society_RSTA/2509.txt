The diurnal inequality of a magnetic element is in continuous variation with
the season of the year; it also varies according to the development of sunspots, and
it depends on the more or less disturbed character of the day. There are most likely
other causes of variation ; for instance, it seems unlikely that the diurnal variation at

3a particular station remains wholly unaffected by the secular change in the earth’s
a magnetism. In deciding on the amount of detail advisable in the presentation of the
8 facts, several conflicting considerations have to be allowed for. There is a great deal
g which in the present state of our knowledge must be regarded as accidental in the
magnetic changes on any individual day. If we derive inequalities from the combi-
2 nation of a very limited number of days, a good deal of this “accidental” element will
S remain uneliminated.
