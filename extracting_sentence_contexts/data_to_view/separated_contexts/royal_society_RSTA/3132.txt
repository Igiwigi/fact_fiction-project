Very good expositions of the lattice-
theoretical approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics are available [16,17]. The fact that
no scientific discipline generated an amount of literature on its foundations comparable in volume
to that devoted to quantum theory is a clear sign of dissatisfaction not with the theory itself,
whose successes are undisputed, but on the distance between physical intuition and mathematical
formalism. The enormous success of the Feynman integral approach is most probably due to the
fact that it allows the well-established intuition on classical Lagrangian systems to be transferred
to the quantum domain. Although not comparable with that on quantum theory, there is also a consistent literature 4 |
on the foundations of classical probability. Starting from previous ideas of Ramsay, De

Finetti succeeded in deducing the basic elementary laws of probability (including conditional â€œ3
probability) from axioms formulated uniquely in terms of bets, gains and losses.
