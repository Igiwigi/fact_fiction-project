In these equations as applied to one calibration only there are py +2 unknowns,
namely 09, 1), 29---%-++(px Of these) and the two quantities A, and By. Thus
there are two more unknowns than equations. This is in accordance with the fact that
the graph possesses two degrees of freedom whilst still expressing the same relative
positions of the points. The introduction of the equations resulting from another calibration, however (say
the Mth), in general only adds few or no unknowns of the type 2, i plus the two
unknowns Ay and By, while the total number of equations is now py + py. With a
number of different calibrations the total number of equations is likely to be greatly in
excess of the total number of unknowns.
