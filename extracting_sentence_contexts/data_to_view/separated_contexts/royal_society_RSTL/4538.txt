Sg6vin on the dilatation of steam ||. From the explanation given by Count RumForp of the heat arising from the fric-
tion of solids, one might have anticipated, as a matter of course, that the evolution
of heat would also be detected in the friction of liquid and gaseous bodies. More-
over there were many facts, such as, for instance, the warmth of the sea after a few
days of stormy weather, which had long been commonly attributed to fluid friction. Nevertheless the scientific world, preoccupied with the hypothesis that heat is a sub-
stance, and following the deductions drawn by Prerer from experiments not sufli-
ciently delicate, baye almost unanimously denied the possibility of generating heat in
that way. The first mention, s0 far as I am aware, of experiments in which the evo-
lution of heat from fluid friction is asserted, was in 1842 by M.
