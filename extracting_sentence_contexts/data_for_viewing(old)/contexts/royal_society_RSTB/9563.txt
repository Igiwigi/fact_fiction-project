slope of each 30m land parcel. For the socioeconomic
analyses, we calculate the average slope (in degrees) based
on the slope of each 100 m land parcel within a canton.

The fact that protected areas have the potential to affect
multiple units (parcels or cantons) raises concerns regarding
the statistical precision of our ATT estimates. The concern is
that if the outcome is systematically correlated across units
