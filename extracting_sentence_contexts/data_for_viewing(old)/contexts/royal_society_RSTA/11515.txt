OCCLUSION OF OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN BY PLATINUM BLACK. 131

determining the heat of occlusion is in connexion with a statement of BerrHetor’s,*
that two definite compounds of platinum and hydrogen exist, viz., Ptg)H, and Pty)Hs,
corresponding to the amount of hydrogen which can be extracted from platinum black
in vacuo at two different temperatures and to two different heats of occlusion.
Favre,! also, found on admitting hydrogen fractionally, in small portions at a time,
that the heat evolved per gram of hydrogen occluded became less and less. As our
results will show, the heat evolved per gram of hydrogen occluded for the fraction of
hydrogen which can be removed at the ordinary temperature, by means of the pump,
from platinum fully charged with hydrogen at atmospheric pressure, is the same as
for the portion which can be extracted in vacuo at 184° C., and consequently we
believe that the results obtained by BerrueLor and by Favre were due to the fact
that the samples of platinum black examined by them contained oxygen.

Having stated in general terms the method adopted by us for the determination of
the heat of occlusion of hydrogen by platinum black, we will now describe the
apparatus employed.

During the first part of this investigation we found that although the bulk of the
hydrogen or oxygen occluded by platinum black was absorbed almost immediately,
a slow absorption went on for hours. This being the case, we found it better to make
use of a Bunsen’s ice calorimeter instead of an ordinary water calorimeter, which
gives the best results when the reaction is nearly instantaneous. We are of opinion
that the ice calorimeter has been too often neglected on account of the difficulty of
