Chile were largely orderly and successful. Despite considerable damage in Hawaii, California and
Chile (reaching a combined US$100 million), and as far as Antarctica, where the tsunami triggered
the calving of an ice shelf [119], only two deaths were reported in the far field (one in Crescent City,
California, and one near Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia), both in violation of evacuation orders. This : =

can be directly contrasted with the 1960 Chilean tsunami, which killed more than 200 people in the Sy
far field, principally in Hawaii and Japan. Evacuating to the protection of deep water thousands 2
of ocean-going vessels of all sizes across the distant shores of the Pacific Ocean easily saved tens aed
if not hundreds of millions of dollars. In these respects, the far-field warnings and evacuations 22
would deserve a green ranking. : Ss

In conclusion, the 2011 Tohoku tsunami stands out as an example of catastrophic disaster, DNS
made significantly worse by inadequate, if not simply inept, mismanagement of its before-the-fact : =
mitigation in the near field [113], and should earn a black star in this respect. However, in the midst : 3

of this despicable record, several glints of hope can be recognized. First, the death toll in Japan
could have been much worse, had it not been for a largely successful evacuation. The daytime
occurrence of the tsunami certainly played a role in this context, but the major cause of this success
can be traced to the awareness of the population, itself a result of the education of the Japanese
people to tsunami hazards. Second, the warnings and evacuation were successfully carried out
in the far field. While these developments were certainly positive and remain encouraging, they
cannot help raise the ‘wisdom index’ for the 2011 Tohoku tsunami to better than a red rating.
