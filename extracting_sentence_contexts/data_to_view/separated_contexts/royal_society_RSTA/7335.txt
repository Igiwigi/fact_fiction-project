But there is no observational data for more ideal
cases. Table 12 compares the values of o? given by the theory with those obtained by
measurementâ€”those latter are given in arbitrary units, chosen so that the product of the
figures in each series is about equal to the product of the corresponding theoretical figures. The agreement between the two sets of data is remarkably good in spite of the fact that in
most cases a high degree of cancellation occurs in the transition integrals so that the values
