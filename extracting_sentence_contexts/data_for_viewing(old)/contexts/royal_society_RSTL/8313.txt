Species and in its habits, and especially in these to Zulus. 'The parts of the mouth
perhaps show a form out of which were derived by modification those of Seolopendra ;
but the resemblance may be superficial. Our knowledge is not yet sufficient to deter-
mine such points. The usual difficulties occur in the matter. Segments may have
dropped out or fused, and their original condition may not be represented at all in the
process of development. In structure Peripatus is more like Seolopendra than Julus,
viz. in the many joints to the antenne (Chilognaths having never more than fourteen), in
the form of the spermatozoa, and in being viviparous, as are some Scolopendras; in the
position of the orifices of the generative glands, and in the less perfect concentration
mesially in Scolopendra of the nerve-cords. Peripatus thus shows affinities in some
points to all the main branches of the family tree of Tracheata; but a gulf is fixed
between it and them by the divarication of the nerve-cords, and borne out s0mewhat
by such facts as the non-striation of the muscles, great power of extension of the body,
arrangement of the digestive tract in the early stage, persistence of metamorphosis, and
in the parts of their mouth, the full history of the manner of origin of these being
reseryed,



DEVELOPMENT OF PERIPATUS CAPENSIS. TT

Speculations as to the mode of origin of the trachee themselves in the Tracheata
are many. Prof, Hagcker * follows GEGENBAUR, whose opinion is expressed in his
* Grundziige der vergleichenden Anatomie,‚Äù 2nd edit. p. 441. GEGExNBAUR concludes
that trachee were developed from originally closed tracheal systems through the inter-
