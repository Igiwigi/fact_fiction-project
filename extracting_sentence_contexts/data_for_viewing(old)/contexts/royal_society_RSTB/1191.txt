The phenomenon of bilaterality of function has also been referred to the normal
exercise of those fibres which degenerate bilaterally (Prrrest) in the spinal cord after
lesion of one hemisphere. Although the degeneration method has established com-
pletely the existence of such atrophy of channels in both lateral columns of the cord
consequent upon a unilateral cerebral lesion, we do not, unfortunately, know whether
these channels are “ recrossed,” as suggested by SHERRINGTON,| CuaRcor, and. others,
or what is their destination, or whether they are to be regarded as of constant
occurrence. As regards the latter point, it is certainly at present considered that
they are not constantly affected by a cerebral lesion, and yet more rarely degenerate
after a hemisection of the spinal cord. As yet, therefore, the method does not afford
anatomical means of deciding the questions at issue.

RELATION oF THE ForEGoInac Facts To ouR OWN EXPERIMENTS.

Tn summarising the facts thus collated on this subject, it is difficult to avoid discus-
sing the theoretical interpretations advanced by the authors quoted, but we do not
think that anything is to be gained by such a procedure, and intend now to merely
point out what conditions yet remain to be satisfied before anything like a full con-
clusion can be arrived at.

All agree that in the intact nervous system a nerve impulse from one hemisphere
may readily pass to the other, excite it, and thus bring about bilaterality of movement
as a result,

Nothing, however, can be judged as to such crossing to the other hemisphere being
