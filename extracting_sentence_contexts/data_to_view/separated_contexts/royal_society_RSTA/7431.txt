The other identities constantly employed are:

(y&) (Pay) = Xi, j,£,, (PP’E) 1S, = 9,

(w’é) inte = 36,(ing), bn Sp Mp Cpr =0,

tgigiytg = —3(iEn) (i6C),
where 7, 2’ are a pair of equivalent symbols cogredient with u, and /, p’ are a pair of
equivalent symbols cogredient with x.

3. Until van der Waerden succeeded in reducing six of the forms given by Ciamberlini
it seems to have been regarded as obvious that the complete system of a number of ternary
quadratics should be self-dual. In fact, the symbolic forms present themselves for con-'
sideration in reciprocal pairs, obtained from each other by interchanging x with u and
i with i. It so happens that none of the processes of reduction actually carried out by earlier
writers had ever involved the splitting up of a symbol p into its components f, p’; thus such
reductions as were carried out applied equally to either of a pair of dual forms. But the
forms of Ciamberlini reduced by van der Waerden are actually the duals of irreducible
forms.
