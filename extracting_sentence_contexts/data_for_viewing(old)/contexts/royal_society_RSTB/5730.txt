of conditions seems, therefore, to have had some effect, though not a large one. Further
breeding of the large-brooded 939 strain at Radlett led to a more considerable change :
and in 1927-1929 broods such as 62/25, 10/10, 32/26 and 15/10 were obtained there
—in all 11 broods averaging 34 snails, with 24 per cent. of dextrals. The controls at
U.C.H. continued as before, and in the corresponding years gave average broods of
136, 64 and 103, with 1-5, 1-4 and 5-7 per cent. dextrals.

We also tried to make comparisons at Merton (London tap water) and Leeds (soft
moorland water), but breeding was unsatisfactory in both places: so far as they go,
the data show no effect on E-ness.

We have, too, the fact that annual fluctuations (statistically real) in brood size and
percentage of dextrals occur in < strains which we should class as pure lines. Thus in
672 (‘Table VI) we have—
