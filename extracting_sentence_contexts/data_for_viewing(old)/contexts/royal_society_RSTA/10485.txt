These numbers seem to indicate that with potentials greater than 240 volts an
ordinary vacuum discharge took place at some point or points in the tube ; in the
following experiments care was therefore taken never to use potentials greater than
80 volts

§ 4. Relation between the Current under a given Voltage and the Temperature.

In the case of sodium, owing to the fact that the current could not be saturated,
its value under a given electromotive force was measured at different temperatures.

This comes to practically the same thing as measuring the saturation current, since
we should expect, ceteris paribus, the current with a given electromotive force always
to be proportional to the number of ions liberated at the metal surface. In order to
be sure of not getting a discharge, a potential of about 80 volts between the wire
A,B,, and the cylinder was always employed. The following table represents a series
of observations of current and temperature ranging from 217° C. to 427°C. It will
be seen that the corresponding range of current is from 10~® to 10~? ampire; in
other words, raising the temperature of the metal from 217° to 427° increases the
current to ten million times its original value. The currents below 10~7 ampére
were measured with the electrometer. In this series of experiments very low values
