lower portion of the left vena cava superior or left vena azygos on the other, is ap-
parent, not only in their likeness as to shape and structure and the disposition of their
branches and valves, but also in the similarity of their situation, direction and con-
nections with the heart, and in the resemblance, not altogether overlooked by anato-
mists, of their respective openings into the right auricle.

According to RaTart, however, whose authority is generally followed, the left an-
terior primitive venous trunk in the human subject closes and entirely disappears in
the progress of development, from the root of the neck down to the heart. But if, on

A the contrary, the coronary sinus, as found in the adult condition, in Man and some
© of the higher Mammalia, be, as is above suggested, the analogue of, or, to express
= the fact in another form, be the lower pervious portion of the left primitive vein,
S might it not possibly happen that, even on the fully-formed heart, xome remnant of its
S upper occluded portion should still exist, above the valved entrance of the coronary
2 vein into the coronary sinus ?
= Searching, accordingly, in the adult human heart, I have found, in upwards of
Z twenty different instances, certain parts or structures (Plate I. fig. 1, o, {, v) always
5 clearly distinguishable, though varying in distinctness, which, from their position and

2 Analogous remnants of the left primitive vein are also to be seen, in all those Mam-
Z malia in which—as in the Dog, the Cat and the Monkey—the same amount of oc-
Z clusion of that vessel occurs as in the human subject ; and a comparative examina-
