the corresponding light will be feeble or will vanish. Or it may be supposed that our
metals and gases are compounds of unknown elements which are separated by the dis-

would at once lead to analysis of many of our supposed simple substances; and the facts
which have been stated respecting the band No. 49 give some countenance to it. T how-

of matter in the circuit; but its intensity depends on the nature of that matter, which
may either make it extremely bright or obscure it, even to invisibility.
