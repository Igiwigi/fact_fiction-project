In 5 hours, vomited some bloody mucus, and expired.


264, Sir Everard Home's Appendix, &c,

On opening the body, the stomach contained mucus tinged
with blood, and its internal membrane. was inflamed ;- the
duodenum had its internal surface universally inflamed, the
same appearance in a less degree was met with in the. jeju-
nium and ilium, and more strongly marked in the colon than
in the ilium.

The facts which I have now adduced, afford sufficient proof
of the action of the colchicum autumnale upon the different
parts of the body, being through the medium of the circula-
tion, and not in consequence of its immediate effects upon
the stomach and intestines.
