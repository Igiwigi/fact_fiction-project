They all showed
polarization-currents, but only of feeble intensity, the deflection of the galvanometer-
needle yarying from 2 to 7 divisions on the scale. Though small, these currents were,
however, quite distinct. That all these currents were real polarization-currents was also evident from the fact
that, on lifting any tube out of the commutator and replacing it with its electrodes
reversed in the mercury-cups, the deflection was always on the opposite side of zero to
what it had been previously. 'The next piece used was that in tube No. 15, whose resistance is comparatively small,
being about 0247 of a megohm. The positive pole of the above battery having been
connected with the marked end of the tube, the current was sent through it for five
minutes, and gave rise to a polarization-current of —25, The same current was then
sent through it in the same direction as before for 15 minutes, but at the end of that
time the resulting polarization-current was only —11.
