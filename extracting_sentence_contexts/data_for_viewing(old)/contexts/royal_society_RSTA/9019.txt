The final stage of growth of the uranium halo may be taken as that at which the
outward expansion of the pupil has absorbed the third ring. The halo at this stage
very often exhibits the appearance of a large and very dark pupil surrounded by an
almost uniform penumbra-like band representing the effects of RaC. The last four
haloes in the Table given below are of this character. In the other five haloes the
darkening of the external ring has not extended inwards to meet the pupil. Its
inner radius is denoted by R,. The haloes in this Table may be described as showing
the final state of a uranium halo before every feature disappears in blackening which
extends out to the limits attained by RaC.

The measurements contained in the Table are not quite so available as those
already given, on account of the fact that the correction for the nucleus must be
guess-work. I have made an allowance for it amounting to 0:0006 mm., that is I
have assumed the nuclear radius to be 0:0012 mm.
