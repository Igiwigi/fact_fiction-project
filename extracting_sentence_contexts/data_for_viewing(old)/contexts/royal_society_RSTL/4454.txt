will be observed, too, that the combined influence of warmth, air, and moisture, which
favours the rapid decay of dead tissne, is that which most promotes the. growth of
the living plant. Further, the more rapid and energetic are the processes of growth,
the s00ner (generally speaking) are they succeeded by decomposing changes ; this is
seen especially in the Fungi, whose growth is more speedy, and whose degeneration
is more immediately consequent upon the completion of their term of life, than that
of any other tribe of plants; and it. is seen also in cases in which the leaves haye
been forced into extraordinary activity by. an excess of heat, and light, their death
and exuviation being thus induced at a comparatively early period. Conversely, if
the vital operations be retarded by the withdrawal of the external agencies on which
they are dependent, we find that the life of the structure is proportionally prolonged,
and the decomposing changes are retarded accordingly ; this is seenin_the well-
known fact, that a bouquet of flowers may be made to preserve its appearance of
freshness for some time longer when kept in a dark room than it would do if exposed
to light. These facts, and many others which might be cited, indicate, that every
integral part of the living fabric possesses within itself a capacity of being 80, acted
on by external agencies, that the very forces which would tend to. decompose and
destroy it if it were dead, only excite it to vital activity if it. be alive; but, that this
capacity lasts no longer than the completion of its own term of growth, every indi-
vidual cell being destined to pass through a certain series of changes, the completion of
which leaves it at the mercy of the physical and chemical agencies to which it may
