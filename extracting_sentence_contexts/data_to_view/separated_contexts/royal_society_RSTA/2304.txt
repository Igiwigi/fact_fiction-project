This is achieved 7a
after only a small number of iterations, and with a high level of stability of the numerical Dw
algorithm. :

Note that figures 6 and 7 establish implicit relationships between the length of the process zone : 3S
and two fracture parameters under consideration. They will be used later to identify admissible : Ss
length of the process zone for a stable crack, see §4c. .

(b) Displacements inside the fracture zone

To conduct an examination of the process zone, y=0, —L <x <0, we recall from (2.6) that
W(x) corresponds to the jump of displacements along the interface [[u]](x,0) = W(x)(1 — H(x)). In
fact, the displacements u;(x,0), (j= 1,2) can be obtained in terms of this function by applying
the inverse Fourier transform to (2.11), while for the traction we simply use the transmission
conditions (2.3)

uj(x,0) =(—1y71 Pres oyz(x,0) = ZW), -L<x<0. (4.4)

To demonstrate the solution convergence for the function W(x), we consider the case! when
L, = 0.5. Similarly to the previous subsection, we introduce the new measure

8Wrlx) = |Wr41 (x) — Wa), (4.5)

where W,,(x) is the function W(x) at the nth iteration. The values of this measure, alongside
the corresponding dimensionless solution for W;,(x)/l along the process zone, are provided in
figure 8.
