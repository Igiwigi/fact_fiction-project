6. An imperfect plasticity in ice has sometimes been spoken of. The fact is, all solid
bodies might be said to have an imperfect plasticity, if we chose to admit this vague-
ness in scientific language, since all are capable of greater or less extension or compres-
gion. As to the apparent plasticity inferred from the motion of glacial masses, and
arising from the crevicing of the ice, I have explained that it has no relation whatever
to real plasticity, Such crevices are the necessary consequences of the external forces
acting on the glacier, and are as essential to the theory of regelation as they are uncon-
nected with any property of plasticity. I proceed, as proposed in my introductory remarks, to explain the sliding of glaciers,
