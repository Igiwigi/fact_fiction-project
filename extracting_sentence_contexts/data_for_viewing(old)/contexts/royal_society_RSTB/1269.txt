Cryptogams as to the origin of sterile septa from a continuous potential archespor
In the meanwhile, we may note with additional interest the presence of a
number of sterile cells in the young sporangia of Hquisetum, and, though they do
develop as elaters with thick walls, still in their condition of sterility they may
perly be compared with those of the Liverworts, especially of the type show
Oxymitra.

Another question will be whether from other types of Vascular Oryp
evidence can be gained of the origin of upgrowths (sporangiophores) which y
raise the sporangia beyond the surface of the part on which they are produced;
evidence would be of peculiar value in its bearings upon the question under dis

In any discussion such as that before us, the facts concerning the strobili of cer
fossil forms will have to be considered. Whatever opinions may be held as to then
or more remote kinship of modern Hquiseta to the Calamaries, there can, I think
little doubt that the strobilus of a modern Equisetwm as a whole is the homolog:
the whole spike-like fertile branch in the latter group. Assuming this to be gre
we see on comparing these several strobili that there is some variety in their cons
tion, and in the relations of the component parts one to another. Such points
have to be considered in the general discussion of the question, which will be take
later.

In the meanwhile I see in the case of Equisetum no @ priori objection to
working hypothesis ; the details of development would rather support it. But
it can be seriously entertained, some more consecutive evidence will be required
