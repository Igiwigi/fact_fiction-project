} matter.
= Less direct, but no less striking, evidence to the same effect is afforded by the fact,
gestablished by preliminary experiments, that the ratio of velocities of the blue and
& yellow boundaries is practically the same in different experiments with the same
BS concentration of the same salt, no matter how the dimensions of the tube be
Svaried. There is also the fact, already stated, that this ratio in any one experiment
remains practically constant from first to last. Very slight variations, it is true, do
A occur, attributable most probably to the presence of impurities in the gelatine or in
the salts employed, or to slight heating by the current in spite of the constant
temperature bath. But such small deviations from perfect constancy need not be
considered at present.

A third line of evidence is found in the fact that, while it is possible to greatly
vary the relative velocities of the same indicators by using different salt-jellies, it is
found that the relative rates of advance of the two boundaries remain the same with
different indicators and the same salt-jelly. The latter part of this statement has,
however, so far been tested only by the substitution of potassium ferrocyanide, and by
that of a tartrate solution, for the usual chromate in experiments with potassium
