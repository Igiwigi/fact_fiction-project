increase strongly with the number of glutamates bound,
because glutamate dilutes rapidly as it diffuses in the synaptic
cleft away from the fusion pore, and because of the low affinity
of the activation process for glutamate and the high affinity of
the desensitization process for glutamate (see below), the
majority of the current during a quantal event results from
the activation of the tens of AMPA channels within a ‘hotspot’
centred around the vesicle release site. As shown in figure 1b,
this hotspot has approximately 100nm radius and thus
covers only a small fraction of most synapses.

One important mechanism of hotspot generation is the
fact that AMPARs somewhat distant from the site of vesicle
fusion may desensitize before they activate. The importance
of this desensitization in understanding the generation of
the quantal response is underscored by the fact that blocking
desensitization leads to a large increase in the total charge of
the mEPSC, primarily due to increased duration of the
response. The operation of the AMPA channel can be under-
stood as a race between activation, which can occur very
quickly if the concentration of glutamate is high, and desen-
sitization, which is slower but is stimulated by lower
concentrations. Within the hotspot, activation beats desensiti-
zation. However, further away from the site of vesicle release,
desensitization beats activation, and there are therefore few
