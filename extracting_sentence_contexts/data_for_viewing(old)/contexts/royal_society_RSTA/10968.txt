or d be zero. The latter is, of course, unnecessary if we agree to arrange a, b, c, d
so that ad is always greater than be. Now it is clear that Q, possesses a great
advantage over Q, in rapidity of calculation, but the coefticient of correlation is also
a coefficient which measures the association, and it is a great advantage to select one
which agrees to the closest extent with the correlation, for then it enables us to
determine other important features of the system.

If we do not make all the above conditions, we easily obtain a number of coeffi-
cients which would vanish with the transfer. Thus for example the correlation 4 of
Equation (xxxviii.) is such an expression.* It has the advantage of a symmetrical
form, and has a concise physical meaning. It does not, however, become unity when

* In fact (xxxvii.) gives us € = on7KT Ae

either, but not both, b and ¢ vanish, nor does it, unless we multiply it by 7/2 and
take its sine, equal the coefficient of correlation when a = d and b = e,
Again, we might deduce a fairly simple approximation to the coeflicient of correla-
tion from the Equation (xxiv.) for @, using only its first few terms. Thus we find
