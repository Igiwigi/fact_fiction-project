It must be noted here that in the first horizontal line, no cylin-
der is suppoxed to be attached to the rod ; and therefore these values are not directly comparable with
the rest. A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM, 451

The differences between these mean values would indicate the quantity
of air dragged by the sides of a cylinder of this diameter, according to its
thickness: but which does not appear to be yery regular in its march ; since
the thin cylinders drag more in proportion than the thicker ones. Till this
fact is more fully ascertained, we cannot deduce a correct general formula for
determining the quantity of air dragged by cylinders of different diameters
and thicknesses, 8wung in the manner above mentioned. The next set of experiments were made with thin circular discs of brass,
having about the same thickness as common thick post paper. Twenty
pieces, screwed together in a vice, measured *08 inch ; consequently the thick-
ness of each of the brass discs may be assumed equal to 004 inch.
