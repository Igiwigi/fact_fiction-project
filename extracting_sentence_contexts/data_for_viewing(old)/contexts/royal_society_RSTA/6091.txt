equation?

We already know one such secondary source—gravitational field energy or self-interaction—
which is produced by matter through a gravitational field that has energy. It has no independent


existence of its own. So the vacuum energy is precisely on the same footing as gravitational
field energy. How does the latter gravitate in GR, certainly not by a stress tensor as the
Einstein equation has no such contribution? Gravitational potential for a static point mass, the
Schwarzschild solution, goes as 1/r adhering to good old Newtonian inverse square law. Where
has the contribution of the field energy gone? Since it does not contribute to stress tensor, it
cannot have its effect in the force law, which is why Newton’s Law remains intact in GR. It
gravitates more subtly through curvature of 3-space, and is in fact sitting in the g,, component
of the Schwarzschild metric. Thus we could say Einstein is Newton with space curved [4]. It is the
curvature of space that comes into play only in non-radial motion, and it beautifully accounts for
the Mercury perihelion advance and also facilitates the so-called bending of light.”

Since gravitational field energy and vacuum energy share the same character and nature of
their origin—produced by matter as a secondary effect—and cannot exist of their own, vacuum
energy should likewise gravitate in the similar subtler way than by a stress tensor. It should
therefore gravitate by enlargement of framework, like flat to curved space for the gravitational

field energy. Enlargement of framework would require a new theory. As gravitational energy : =
cannot be included in the Newtonian theory, similarly vacuum energy cannot be accommodated : =
in GR. Since it is a quantum creature, it would require a quantum theory of gravity and space— :B
