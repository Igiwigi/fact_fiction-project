Fix any non-zero v € ®,(Y,)
D and consider the curve v(s) =v + ¢(s)v € ®s(Y;) for s € [sx — €,S + €] with v(sx) =v. By the
definition of Y,, there is a family of solutions p(x;s) of (1.6) such that v(s) = ®,(p(x;s)). The
notation p(x;s) denotes the fact that p(x;s) € Y, depends on s as a parameter and is a function of
x; then (p(x; s)) = p(s;s) is the solution p(x;s) evaluated at x = s. Denoting by dot the derivative
with respect to the variable s so that

i(s) = (p'(x;s) + p(%s))lx=s,
we claim that
w(u(sx), d(Sx)) > 0, (3.3)
Assuming the claim, we finish the proof as follows: as for each non-zero v € ®.,(Y,) ND the
crossing form Q_y satisfies
Quivv=£)  ovo@y=2|  ow,v +06»)
=— ov, Vv) = — ov, Vv
mes ds S=S, ‘ ds S=S,
= o(U(Sx), 0(Sx)) > 0,
the form is positive definite. Thus, each crossing sx € (—0o, L] is positive, so Az, > 0.
