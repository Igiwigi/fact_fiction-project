Received January 26,—Read February 11, 1836. Mr pear Farapay,

YOU know how deep an interest I have taken in your © Experimental Rescarches
in Electricity,” and how zealously I have availed myself of the opportunities, which
you have ever kindly afforded me, of profiting by your oral explanation of such difli-
cultics as occurred to me in the study of your last series of papers in the Philoso-
phical Transactions. Having been early impressed with the conviction that the
science of chemistry would date, from their publication, one of its great revolutions
and eras of fresh impulse, I have been careful not only to store my own mind with
the new facts and reasonings which they contain, but to impress them upon my
pupils in my class room ; and for this purpose I have been led to contrive some new
apparatus and forms of experiments, by which the principles which you have promul-
gated have been verified, and, I think, in some instances demonstrated to advantage. In thus working in the mine which you have opened, you will be the last to be sur-
prised if I should have moreover stumbled upon some threads of ore which you may
have passed by, or temporarily abandoned, whilst following the main lode ; and you
will not be displeased that I venture to snbmit to your judgement whether there be
enough of novelty or importance in the following observations to render them worthy
of the attention of the Royal Society. One result, I know, will gratify you ; namely, that amongst the almost innumerable
tests to which I have exposed your great discovery of the definite chemical action of
electricity, T have found no fact to militate against it; and you will the more rejoice
Should I sncceed in proving to you that, under the direction of this fundamental
principle, I have been led to the construction of a voltaic arrangement, which fur-
nishes a constant current of electricity for any length of time which may be required;
and have thus been enabled to remove one of the greatest difficulties which have
hitherto obstructed those who have endeavoured to measure and compare the dif-
ferent voltaic phenomena, viz.
