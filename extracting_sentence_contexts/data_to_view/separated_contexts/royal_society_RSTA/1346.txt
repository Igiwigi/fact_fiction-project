(<= 2, )'h

stands for an infinity of (PA),’s (isosceles triangles of sides 1, \/2, 4/2) filling a plane. Tt can be obtained by uniformly compressing a {3, 6} or ah in the direction of one
edge. The fact that corresponding sections of (PA), 2\/2 and of (PA), 3/2 are similar, in
the linear ratio 2:3, except in the last case (cight co-ordinates equal), is merely a
consequence of 10.13.

10.6. (PA), 3\/? clearly possesses 84 symmetries U,;, and 84 symmetries V,,,, defined
as follows :—

U;;, increases the co-ordinates ,, «,, ©, each by 2, and diminishes the remaining six
each by 1.

V,, diminishes «,, «,, 2, each by two-thirds of their sum, and diminishes cach of the
remaining six co-ordinates by one-third of the sum of those six. Thus Uy, is a translation (through distance 34/2); and V,, is the rotation (through
angle =) about, or the reflection in, the 7-space
