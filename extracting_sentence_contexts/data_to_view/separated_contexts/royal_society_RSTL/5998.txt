So far as I can see, the complementary character
of the phenomena is perfectly natural, and presents no difficulty to the mind in con-
ceiving of it. When the beam is intense, and its action continued for some time, the flowers expand,
= 80 as to form liquid plates within the mass. Looked at edgeways, these liquid spaces
S appear like fine lines; which proves that the melting is not symmetrical laterally and
© vertically, but that the ice melts in the planes of freezing much more readily than at
5 right angles to these planes.
