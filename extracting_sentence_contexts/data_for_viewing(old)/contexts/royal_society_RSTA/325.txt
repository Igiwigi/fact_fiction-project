a user-centric platform where users post, share, annotate, comment, forward content be it text,
videos, pictures, URLs etc. This social dimension creates tremendous new opportunities for
information exchange over the Internet and Web. But how are we to customize the experience
so that it is relevant to our particular interests and context. Her paper reviews existing
personalization approaches, most of which are centralized. She then advocates the need for fully
decentralized systems. These however present two familiar challenges: scalability and privacy.
Her paper shows how to achieve personalization in decentralized systems and describes the
continuing challenges of providing effective privacy-enhancing technologies.

As the Web grows, changes and expands, researchers must seek novel ways to explore,
navigate and search its content. Karger’s [8] paper discusses the challenge of exploring the vast
information spaces that are continuously emerging on the Web. The problem is compounded by
the fact that, to date, most data authoring and management tools have been oriented towards
programmers and Web developers. Users have been unable to really harness structured data for
information management and communication. He describes research that enables end users to
define their own schemas (without even knowing what a schema is), manage data and author (not
program) interactive Web visualizations using the Web tools with which they are already familiar.

A third session at the workshop dealt with our understanding of the Web as a social construct
with talks from Levy, Castells, Margetts and von Ahn. It is unfortunate only two of these
presentations, Margett’s and von Ahn’s, are represented in this collection of papers. However,



it is worth noting that Levy’s work as a philosopher who researches how humans can exhibit 4 |
