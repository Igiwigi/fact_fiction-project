That part of the fibres composing the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal
nerves ascend longitudinally with the white columns, without entering the grey sub-
stance of the chord, and transmit to and from the brain impressions which give rise

to sensation and voluntary motion, is the opinion maintained by many eminent
physiologists and excellent observers.

In support of this doctrine, Mr. GraixcerÂ®*, Mr. SoLLyF, and Dr. J. Bupcs+ have
adduced the fact of having traced these fibres in the spinal chord of the vertebrata,
A similar fact is said to have been established by Mr. Nzweorryh and Dr. Careexrer
in the invertebrata. On the other hand, the opinion that all the fibres of the Spinal
nerves enter the grey substance and belong exclusively to the spinal chord, is held
by Topp and Bowman ||, STiLING<, VoLkManN#* and others.

In making the preparations for the investigation of this subject, I employed the
second method described in my former communication on the Spinal Chord4+. The
animals selected for this purpose were the Ox, Calf, Cat, Rat, Mouse, and Frog.
After many fruitless attempts I succeeded in rendering perfectly transparent the
entire chords of the Mouse and Frog, but found that their cylindrical form interfered
considerably with a distinct view of their several parts, and rendered the examination
unsatisfactory. Having 8ucceeded, however, in a similar way, with longitudinal
