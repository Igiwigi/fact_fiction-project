Thus we find a certain phylogenetic and ontogenetic support
for the statement that the very divergent elements of the sporadic mesoblast have a
morphological homogeneity in the fact that they have arisen from a primitive amoeboid
wandering cell with no specifie granulation, by a process of morphological and
physiological differentiation akin to that which has, pari passu, led to the increasing
complexity of the animal generally. &

Physiological. The question of the functional significance to be attributed to the sporadic mesoblast
al solution in the very incomplete series of facts we possess bearing
Undoubtedly the wandering cells are present
largely as a protective mechanism to guard against the intrusion of foreign substances,
living or non-living, into the organism. But. this is probably only a small part, and
not the most primitive of their functions.
