190 MR. F. M. BALFOUR ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

These statements, which have not been since confirmed, diverge nearly to the same
extent from my own results as does the ordinary account of the development of these parts.

Hexsegx (Vircuow's © Archiv,” vol. xxxi. 1864) also looks upon the spinal nerves as
developed from the epiblast, but not as a direct result, of his own observations®.

Without attempting, for the present at least, to explain this divergence, I venture to
think that the facts which I have just described have distinct bearings upon one or
two important problems.

One point of general anatomy upon which they throw considerable light is the primi-
tive origin of nerves.

So long as it was admitted that the spinal and cerebral nerves developed in the embryo
independently of the central nervous system, their mode of origin always presented to my
mind considerable difficulties.

1t never appeared clear how it was possible for a state of things to have arisen in
which the central nervous system, as well as the peripheral terminations of nerves,
whether motor or sensory, were formed independently of each other, while between
