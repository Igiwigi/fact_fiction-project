Both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries are equally legitimate, but, e.g., the statement
“the sum of angles in a linear triangle is always equal to x” is correct only in the former. In
theoretical work the choice between several equally legitimate theories is a matter of personal taste
only. In problems of application the personal taste is again the decisive moment, but it is certainly
influenced by considerations of the relative convenience and the empirical facts. t The problem of the definition of measure in relation to the theory of probability has been
recently discussed by Eomnickr and Uta (1934), who quote an extensive literature.
