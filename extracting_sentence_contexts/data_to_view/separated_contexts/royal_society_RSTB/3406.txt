But on the hypothesis now advanced this does not appear to be necessary
in all cases. All that is assumed is that the eight nuclei are either all potentially
sexual or, in most cases, seven or less are the reduced representatives of nuclei which
possessed this character. And it is probable that in very many groups no such
specialisation occurred in the antipodal cells as is characteristic of the functional egg-
apparatus, Their persistence in the higher Angiosperms is no doubt largely to be
accounted for by the fact that they have acquired a new function and play a more or
less important part in the nutrition of the sac. In the remarkably reduced sae of
Cypripedium an antipodal group is not formed.{ Whether the organisation of anti-
podal cells in the Angiosperms has any connection with a chalazogamous method of
fertilisation is doubtful.
