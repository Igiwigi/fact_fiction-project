Asa result of this varied and very complicated research, which took over three years,

we find that under the action of light we have a region of galvanic cells which is just

ERRATUM. Page 339, line 25: for “indicating a decomposition of 1 gramme electrochemical
equivalent in 30,000 years,” read “indicating the separation, by decomposition, of
1 gramme of Hydrogen or of its électrochemical equivalent in 3,000,000 years.”

indicating a decomposition of 1 gramme electrochemical equivalent in 30,000 years. The true meaning of the observations of BecquerEL and MINcHIN is now apparent.
“The very curious inversion of the current” observed by Mrncurn with “ Ag plates
immersed in water containing eosine in solution” (p. 211), ‘‘ Ag plates immersed into
alcohol containing naphthalene red ” (p. 212), with “ bismuth in water” (p. 213), with
“tin plates in aleohol” (p. 216), with his “sensitive” cell, consisting of a tin plate
acted upon by nitric acid, and a tin plate in methyl alcohol (p. 222), is evidently in
each case due to the fact that all these systems, as now clearly appears from their
composition, must form inconstant cells exhibiting polarisation. The reason why Brecqueret with Ag, BrAg and IAg plates fi mind a current
sometimes in one direction, sometimes in another, is not “the thickness of the
layer,” but the kind of combination of the heterogeneous system, of which the given
plate forms only a part. An Ag-AgCl plate in NaCl solution gives a constant cell,
reversible in respect of the anion; its current must, as will be shown later on, flow
from the plate in the dark to the plate in the light.
