» curves representing the evolution of carbon dioxide are also shown in fig. |

d if the amount of carbon dioxide is added to the quantity of oxygen aaptacitids
rves are obtained which more nearly coincide. It is difficult to account for this.
the platinum black had got contaminated with traces of organic matter in any
neeivable way, then possibly the carbon might annex some of the oxygen, and this
ould afterwards reappear as carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide formed in this way
would occupy the same volume as the original oxygen, and some weight is lent to
‘is hypothesis by the fact that the sum of the oxygen and carbon dioxide is more
rly constant.

Platinum black, dried at 100° C., thus contains rather less than 100 volumes, or
bout 0°66 per cent. by weight of oxygen. The amount of oxygen contained in
Aatinum black varies, however, in different samples, and seems also to depend largely
n the temperature at which it is dried. ;
As regards the carbon dioxide contained in the four specimens of the same prepa-
jon of platinum black which have been examined, its amount seems to vary
etween about 3 and 14 volumes; but, as has already been suggested, the apparently
er quantities of carbon dioxide may possibly correspond to an accidental introdue-
