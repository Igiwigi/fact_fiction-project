There is a sulcus immediately lateral to the outer end of the sulcus occipitalis
transversus which passes backwards from the main sulcus. This might be regarded
as the upper end of the pars dorsalis sulci lunati ; but this is rendered doubtful by
the fact that is it a shallower sulcus than the main sulcus and does not cut it very
deeply. Since the extent of the area striata could not be determined it seems
desirable to leave the exact interpretation somewhat indefinite ; being satisfied
with the fact that the pars ventralis is clearly defined. Posterior to the large obliquely
placed sulcus five sulci are seen crossing the occipital regon. The most inferior of
them passes forwards under the lower end of the pars ventralis and is the sulcus
occipitalis inferior.
