A number of rivers show a different sign of change for WSI at +2°C anc
+4°C. The Godavari, Tapti and Yangtze basins show a decrease in WSI in a
+2°C world and an increase in WSI in a +4°C world; the opposite trend occurs
for Dniester, Garonne, Oder, Vistula, Rio Grande de Santiago, Sacramento anc
Chubut basins. The change in population and the directions of change in run-
off in these basins for both temperature regimes are in fact the same: it is the
magnitude of the changes in run-off and population that results in the opposite
signs of change in WSI for the two temperature regimes. For the first set o
yasins, the changes in run-off are small and close to natural variability in a +2°C
world. An increase in the population is observed for the 2060s, hence there is an
increase in stress.
