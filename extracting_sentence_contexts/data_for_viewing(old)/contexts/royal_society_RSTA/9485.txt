better developed night maximum, and there seems to be no secondary maximum and
minimum.

The W difference curve differs markedly from both the ordinary and quiet day
curves. There is no morning minimum near 8 a.m., as in the ordinary day curve, and
instead of a sharply defined maximum in the early afternoon, there is a wide plateau
for some four hours on either side of noon. The largest ordinate appears at 4 p.m.,
i.e., from two to three hours later than in the ordinary day curve. Whether. the
saddle near 1 p.m., which is more apparent in the sunspot maximum and minimum
than in the 11-year curves, is a real or an accidental feature is open to some doubt.

The V and T difference curves closely resemble one another, as might have been
inferred from the fact that the difference between ordinary and quiet day inequalities

is much larger for V than for H. The two curves, while quite unlike the ordinary
day V and T curves, closely resemble the disturbed less quiet day V difference
