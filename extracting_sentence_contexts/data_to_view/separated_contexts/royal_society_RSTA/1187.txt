Both planets were
observed to have a temperature of 750 K at their respective exobase, but Uranus displayed
a much more extended upper atmosphere compared to Neptune. This is because the weak
vertical mixing lowers the altitude of the homopause [23], producing a more extended upper
atmosphere. It is noteworthy that the temperature profiles in figure 1b are constrained by only
a handful of measurements, highlighting the fact that Uranus and Neptune remains the most
poorly characterized planets in the solar system.

5, The era of H3"

Emissions from Hy were discovered for the first time outside the laboratory at Jupiter in 1988
[34] as Voyager 2 was approaching Neptune. By analysing the observed H} near-infrared spectra
we can derive the temperature of the upper atmosphere, the column integrated density of the
ionosphere, and radiative cooling rates. These products provide a powerful view through which
we can begin to understand the processes that govern the upper atmosphere.

(a) Uranus

Hj was discovered by Trafton et al. [35] in April 1992 using the United Kingdom Infrared
Telescope (UKIRT), three months prior to the detection of Hy of Saturn [36].
