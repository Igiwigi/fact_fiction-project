5. By these equations the state of a wave at any moment is connected with its genesis ;
and they contain in fact the complete solution of the problem of every kind of motion,
in a tube, which can be generated by a piston.

6. From (11.) it appears that u=U ; that is, that the particle-velocity generated by
the piston is transmitted through the medium without suffering any alteration. The
same equation (11.) shows that between the density and the velocity there is an inva-
riable relation, which is independent of the law of original genesis of the motion ; 80
that in the same wave, or in different waves, wherever there is the same density, there
will also be the same velocity.

7. One of the most, obvious facts on looking at the equations just found is, that for
the same genesis there are two values of , two of y, and two of e. The signitication of

the Astronomer Royal two particular forms of the function F; without perceiving, however, that a slight
generalization of his results would put him in the way to the integral expreszed by the equations (5.).

this is, that a single disturbance generates #200 waves ; and (11.) shows that for one of
