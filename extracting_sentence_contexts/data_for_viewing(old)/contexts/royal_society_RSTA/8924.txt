IN THE SPECTRUM OF MANGANESE, 139

When these conclusions were arrived at, the publication of Krna,* “ On the Variation
with Temperature of the Electric Furnace Spectrum of Manganese,” came to hand. It
will be interesting to quote the following remarks (p. 142): “* 25433 and 25395 are
remarkable by their strength at low temperature. 25341 is stronger than either of
these at high temperatures but falls off rapidly below 2000°. The temperature of the
furnace, especially in the lower range, may be closely gauged by the relative intensity
of 25341 as compared with 25395 and 25433.’ These results are in perfect agreement
with those arrived at above.

From all these facts the conclusion may be drawn that the lines 25395 and 15433
represent in manganese the inter-combination lines 1S—1lpy,. As the values of Ip,
and 1p, are known from the ordinary triplet series, 1S can be calculated, Thus,

1S — lp, = 18531-65; 1S = 18531-65-+41405-80 = 59937-45 | mean value
1S — 1p, = 18402-51 ; 18 = 18402-51-+-41534-98 — 59937-49 [ 59937-47 — 18.

The value of 18 thus determined forms the starting point for the investigation of the
singlet system.
