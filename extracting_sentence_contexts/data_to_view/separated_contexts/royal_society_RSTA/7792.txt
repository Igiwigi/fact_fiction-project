Any theory of the sorption curve must therefore
explain the discontinuity. The solution of nitrocotton is apparently a continuous
process, but there is some change in the mechanism of solvation which begins when
the nitrocotton goes into solution. Bearing this in mind we may proceed to a hypothesis
which will explain the observed facts, particularly the second principal result. One
supposes that below the solution point water is not appreciably attached to nitrocotton. In the act of solution the nitrocotton molecules surrounded by absorbed acetone
separate from each other.
