In particular, the projection step (DSMC >
LBM) allows one to project the DSMC hydrodynamic moments (fine level of description) onto the
LBM discrete distributions (coarse level of description). In correspondence of the overlapping
region, where both descriptions are accessible, the coefficients a” in equation (2.1) are computed
using the DSMC moments. In fact, because the distribution fN (x, &, f) is completely and uniquely
determined by its values at a set of discrete velocities, one has

a) => Pe Nx, &, HOE, ), (2.2)

where wy and &, are the weights and abscissae of a Gauss quadrature of algebraic precision of
degree >2N and q is the total number of discrete velocities. From inspection of equation (2.2)
and taking into account the classical procedure in which moments are computed in LBM, we
immediately see that the non-equilibrium discrete distributions to be supplemented to the LBM
at the coupling nodes are the scaled values of the continuous distribution function evaluated at
the quadrature abscissae,

It is now possible to define the order N at which the distribution in equation (2.1) is truncated,
as this is directly related to the algebraic precision of the quadrature. As in this work we
present results for the D3Q19 lattice only, we set N = 2, because the proposed quadrature is able
to correctly compute the distribution moments up to the momentum flux tensor, P.
