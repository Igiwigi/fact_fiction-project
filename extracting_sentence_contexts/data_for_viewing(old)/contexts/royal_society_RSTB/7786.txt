their ventral extremity. There are 14 groups on the specimen illustrated. Dorso-laterally,
these are replaced by rather close-spaced, short lirae, not in pairs, on the narrow flange-like
area bordering the cavity of the umbonal region.

Dimensions. Holotype: length 5-4 mm.; height 5-6 mm.; thickness (both valves) 2-25 mm.
Topotype: length 5-8 mm.; height 6-0 mm.; thickness (both valves) 2-6 mm.

Remarks. Superficially this form resembles some members of the Anomiidae, but it
had a definite area of attachment, lacked any true byssal foramen or plug, was not, ap-
parently, subnacreous, and the valves were internally lirate; the left valve, at any rate, also
appears to have had two strong ridges bounding the resilifer, rather than crura. The subalate
dorso-lateral margins, the often straight dorsal margin and non-projecting umbos, and the
fact that the valve margins are internally lirate rather than fluted, induce the writer to
believe that the species is better placed provisionally under Dimya than under Spondylus
or Plicatula. There does not appear to be any closely related species.
