In all the
crystals the c-faces and p-faces predominated, usually the former to the greatest
extent. The g-faces were, as with all the potassium salts of the series, small. The
r’-faces were generally rather large, and sometimes were very prominent indeed, a fact
which has been observed to be characteristic of the iron groups of both the double
sulphates and double selenates. Three good measurements were obtained from little
a-faces, of a narrow type but excellently reflecting. The faces of b {010}, o’ {111},
and n/ {121} were only very minute (usually almost imperceptible lines), and afforded
no adequate reflections of the signal.
