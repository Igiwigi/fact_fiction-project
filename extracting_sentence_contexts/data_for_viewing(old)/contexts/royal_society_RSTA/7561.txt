VARIATION WITH DEPTH OF THE MAIN GEOMAGNETIC FIELD 135

With the H field anomaly, if the horizontal moment per pound of steel is m,,, the field in
the passage AK is due toa line of dipoles in CK and toa pole at A of strength m,,(w, —w,). Thus

my = (2:44.0°5) 10? gauss cm.3/Ib. of iron.

As a working rule for the calculation of possible anomalies we take the Brodsworth results
for m, and m,, since the plots of Z and H against 1/r? give reasonably straight lines. The
polarizations m, and m,, will be proportional to the field components Z and H and to the
demagnetizing coefficients. That m,/m,, = 1-3 whilst Z/H — 2-5 is probably due to the fact
that the greater part of the arch is nearly vertical, the demagnetization coefficient being
therefore greater in the vertical direction. The anomalies at each underground site due to
those passages containing arches and rails, in each case a standard number per unit length,
may now be calculated.

The computed effects of the passages MB and HE at the base-point are Z Ily and
H —+7y. From figures 8 and 9 the effect of passages EAB and CK is Z 6y and H 4y.
The anomaly in Z is large and of the same order as the expected effect AZ to be measured.
This would preclude the use of the pit for the experiment were it not that the distribution of the
neighbouring roadways is simple and the possibility of surveying up to the road EAB allows an
