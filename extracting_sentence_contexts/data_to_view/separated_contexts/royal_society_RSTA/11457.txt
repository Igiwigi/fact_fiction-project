These equations, originally given by Porncars,* suffice, in conjunction with
certain conditions which must hold at the boundary, for the determination of the
four functions u, v, w, . They are perbaps the simplest equations of which to
make use when dealing with the oscillations of a mass of liquid of finite extent in
three dimensions, and, for this purpose, they were first solved by Poincaré in a
form adapted for satisfying boundary-conditions at an ellipsoidal surface, while
additional applications have been considered by Bryan,t Love,t and myself.§ The
possibility of solution in each of these cases however turns on the fact that it only
required to satisfy boundary-conditions at a single ellipsoidal or spheroidal surface,
whereas, in the problem presented by the tides, it is necessary to satisfy conditions
at two surfaces, namely, the ocean bed and the free surface of the ocean. There is, however, a feature attached to this problem which enables us to surmount
