The observations at the end of the lectures were made after the audience had been
in for an hour, and before they left. The fact that the numbers found were so small
after the lecture shows that the influence of the bodies and clothing of persons of
average cleanliness present in a room upon the number of organisms in the air is at
least small as compared with the influence of other conditions. As no micro-organisms come from the breath, those which come from persons present
in a room must arise from their clothes and skin. Hence, if we take the carbonic
acid as a rough measure of the total impurities arising from the persons of those
present in a room, it should be a rough measure of the micro-organisms from the
clothes and skin.
