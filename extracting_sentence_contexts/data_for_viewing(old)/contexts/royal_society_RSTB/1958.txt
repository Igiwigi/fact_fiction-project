nated in the side away from the light, quite a large number had rhizoids arising from
other parts of the eggs. One of these experiments was tried with the eggs on a
surface sloping downwards and away from the light, but the result was the same.
As we feared there was some amount of light reflected from the sides of the box, another
was prepared and carefully blackened inside and the experiment repeated, with still
similar results, though it seemed as if the number of rhizoids arising on the shaded

side was a little greater. One curious fact observed was that with strong lateral
illumination the number of sporelings with two rhizoids opposite each other is much
greater than in those grown in diffuse light. This might seem to indicate that light
does affect the orientation, but it mast be remembered that with light coming through
a slit shadows will be cast by the spores themselves.

It must be borne in mind, also, that the directive action of light upon the elongat-
ing rhizoid is so great that the point of origin of the rhizoid cannot be detected,
except when it is just starting. Still, some of the cultures show in a clear manner
rhizoids starting in a direction at an angle with that of the incident light, then
qurning, so as to grow away from it. We are inclined to think that the character of
‘the egg itself has much to do with deciding the point of origin of the rhizoid, as well
"gs with its early or late production.
