It is true they do not form firm y
develop into cells such as the elaters: they are to be compared rather witl
sterile cells in the sporogonium of Oaymitra (Lerraks, loc. cit., Heft 4, p- 48). whatever comparisons be drawn, the fact remains that sterile cells in large nu
are present in the sporangia of the plants above named. *

(2.) Do any Vascular Cryptogams show distinct parts which may be correlat
position, structure, development, and function with the sporogonial head of Bryop

The strobilus of Hguisetum is in function the counterpart of the sporo
head: its normally terminal position is also similar, though the shoot on
it is borne is more complex in structure and in branching.
