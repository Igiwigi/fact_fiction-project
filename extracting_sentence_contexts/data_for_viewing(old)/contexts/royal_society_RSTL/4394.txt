the descending trumpet-shaped cavities, 15 a; these communicate between the exterior and the interdental
spaces, 34 h, which apparently correspond with the network of small tubes in Megalichthys, 15 c and 16 c, as
already observed. The pulp-cavity, 34 d, takes the place of the cul-de-8ac, 15 f, a communication being main-
tained between the interdental spaces and thee pulp-cavities, by means of the radiating canals, 34 e. And, as

This supposed analogy is, in some degree, supported by the resemblance in the pro-
cess by which the areolz of Megalichthys and the dermal teeth of the Placoids are
developed and increased. In both examples it is by the addition of new internal
layers around the central cavity. The same is the case in the tubercles and teeth of
Macropoma. These facts (if correctly interpreted, and T believe them to be 80) con-
firm the necessity of my proposed restriction of the terms ganoin, enamel (email), &c.
Two perfectly distinct structures have hitherto been comprehended in the expression
* enamel,‚Äù as hitherto applied to the scales of fish, viz. the snperficial, transparent,
hyaline tissue, which usually gives glossiness to the surface of the scale, and a sub-
jacent one, which I propose to distinguish by the name of kosmine*. In some genera,
such as Megalichthys, this latter structure is gradually blended with the former, the
line of demarcation not being visible ; whilst in others, 8nch as Lepidotus, Palceoniscus
ete., it is perfectly distinct from it, blending rather with the snbjacent osseons
tissue. 'These two appear to be as distinct as bone and dentine. The ganoin exhi-
bits no visible trace of structure beyond its arrangement in the form of lamine, and
the occasional existence of minute coloured granular points. When separated from
the tissue upon which it rests, it evinces a marked disposition to crack and splinter in
