The ſuperior Polypus no longer adheres to
the inferior one, but by its poſterior Extremity, which
is till fixed on one Side of the inferior Polypus :
The ſuperior Polypus then begins to make Motions
that ſeemingly tend to the ſeparating of him from
the other ; |and+in a little time he becomes quite
detach'd, ſwims away, and fixes himſelf elſewhere. T have ſcen one come and fix at the Side of the 77-

Natural Hiſtory of all the ſeyeral Polypi of whichT have

Jaſeas of one Species, facilitate in ſeveral ReſpeQs
FShoſe 1 haye to make upon others; and that theſe

{ often throw a new Light upon Obſervations and
Experiments already made. S As all theſe little Animals are exceedingly minute,
have hardly been able to obſerye any of the ſeye-
gl FaQs above-mentioned without the Aſſiſtance of
the Microſcope ; but, if I was to take ſuch ſmall
DbjeQs out of the Water, in order to expoſe them
Þ my Glaſſes in the common Way, I ſhould both.
