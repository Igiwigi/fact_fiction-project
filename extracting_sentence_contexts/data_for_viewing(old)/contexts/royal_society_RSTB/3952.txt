Discussion of the Results of the Macrosiphum Experiment.

If then we grant that the parental and perhaps also the grandparental correlation
coefficients in Macrosiphwm and Hyalopterus are not explicable by the extrinsic
factors which we have discussed (and if they are explicable there is no special
problem here, and they fall into line with the Cladoceran experiments) it is important
to see what bearing they have on theories of genetics.

In comparing the results of the two experiments it must be borne in mind that we
do not know whether Warren’s animals composed a monoclonal or a polyclonal
population, But while if the latter were the case positive ancestral correlation
coefficients were to be expected, the fact that the grandparental coefficient is lower
than the parental is still left unexplained, The problems at present before us are
therefore :—

(1) The existence of a significant ancestral correlation in the monoclonal partheno-
genetic population of Macrosiphum.
