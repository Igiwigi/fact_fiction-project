2. Optical angular momentum

You have only to turn your face to the sun and feel the warmth to appreciate that light carries
energy. This property follows directly from Maxwell’s electromagnetism, as does the fact that light

carries (linear) momentum; indeed Maxwell himself calculated the correct value of the radiation : 2
pressure due to solar radiation on the surface of the Earth [2]. In the quantum theory of light, a : >
plane wave of angular frequency w and wavevector k has energy fiw and momentum hk carried by :8

each photon. In addition to linear momentum, optical beams can also carry angular momentum
which, in the quantum theory, is often expressed as the spin, +hk/|k|, of the photon.
