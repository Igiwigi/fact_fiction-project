an example, «, yeu, which has been defined above, is really the proposition
veu.yeu; and a, y, zeu is the proposition ceu.yeu.zeu.

Dots as Brackets.—The different symbolic forms for the joint assertion of pro-
positions arise from the fact that dots are also used as bracket forms for propositions
according to the following rules :—

(i) The larger aggregation of dots represents the exterior bracket. (ii) The dots
at the end of a complete sequence of symbols are omitted. (iii) The dots immediately
preceding or succeeding the implication sign, viz., 5, are exterior brackets to any
equal number of dots occurring in other capacities (e.g., as above in the joint assertion
of propositions). (iv) The dots which also serve to indicate the joint assertion of
propositions are interior brackets to any equal number of dots occurring in other
capacities. (v) The dots after («) and (qa) are increased in number according to the
necessity for their use as brackets.

In reading a symbolic proposition it is best to begin by searching for that
