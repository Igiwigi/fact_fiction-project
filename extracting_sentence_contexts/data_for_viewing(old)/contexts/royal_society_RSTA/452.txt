Jack Lewis retired from the Chair of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Cambridge
in 1995. He was also the first Warden of Robinson College, from its foundation until 2001. He
was President of the Royal Society of Chemistry from 1986 to 1988 and played a pivotal role in
the establishment and implementation of policy for both the UK and Europe regarding major
environmental issues. He was Chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution
and continued to work on environmental issues until a few months before his death.

Not only was Jack Lewis one of the most innovative and influential scientists of his generation,
he also continued to give outstanding support and encouragement to whole generations of
scientists. It is this fact that has allowed the new chemistry of the elements to be developed as those
of us who follow stand on the shoulders of a true giant.
