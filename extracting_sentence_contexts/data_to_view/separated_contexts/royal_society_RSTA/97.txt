The first proposal
of this kind was made by Yang & Mills [8] in 1954 and in fact independently in the same year by
Ronald Shaw, then a student of Salamâ€™s, though he never published it except as a PhD thesis [9]. This Yang-Mills theory was based on applying the gauge principle to the isospin SU(2) group, and
was intended as a theory of strong interactions. But the fact that isospin is not an exact symmetry
posed a problem, because adding symmetry-breaking terms seemed to destroy the nice properties
of gauge theories. In the end, it did not turn out to be the correct theory of strong interactions; that
is a quite different gauge theory called quantum chromodynamntics (QCD), which I will not discuss in
detail here. However, the Yang-Mills theory is the basis on which all subsequent gauge theories
have been founded.
