Here the bundles of the transverse fibres of the splenium (Spl.) are seen, and in
front of them is a narrow band of fibres from the body of the fornix descending to
the apex of the splenium, where they become more or less transverse in direction. They continue to pass down along the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle,
being bounded in front by the pulvinar of the optic thalamus, and behind by the
commencing fascia dentata of the gyrus hippocampi. During this time the trans-

qi verse fibres of the splenium alter in shape, and are readily distinguished from the
descending fibres of the fornix by their marked transversely-cut appearance, and by
the fact that they are more deeply stained (by Weicert’s method) (fig. 10, F.J/.,
Zand F'J.). ,
A The posterior pillar of the fornix continues descending, and finally joins the
Sfimbria of the cornu Ammonis (fig. 11, Fimb.), the fibres still preserving their
5 peculiarity of being stained a lighter colour (by Wer1cert’s method) than the adjacent
E'fibres of the splenium.
