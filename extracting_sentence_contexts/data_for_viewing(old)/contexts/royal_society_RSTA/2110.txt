Setting I.*

Viz Pj#0— 040. (2.7)

The modified von Neumann equation shows that the time dependence of the density operator
(2.3) has two reasons: the quantum mechanical dynamics represented by the commutator in

(2.6); and the time dependence of the propagator Q in (2.6)2. In conventional quantum theory

of isolated systems, the propagator does not appear, because the {p;} are presupposed to be time-

independent, a fact which causes reversibility, as we will see below. Accepting setting I means,

that irreversibility is generated by an in time changing composition of the density operator a.
From (2.3), (2.1) and (2.6) follows:

?Semi-classical means: heat- and power-exchange are not influenced by the system’s Hamiltonian.

SIf the density operator has a degenerate spectrum, the following considerations can be cast in terms of eigenprojectors
instead of eigenvectors.
