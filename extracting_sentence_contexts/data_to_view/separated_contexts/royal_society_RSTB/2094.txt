There is clearly the same irregularity of behaviour here
hat we have noted in regard to nocturnal closure of the stomata. Thus, Spar-
Mannia* did not open between January 22 and January 29, whereas, in November,
3396, it was well open after 29 hours’ darkness; this was also true of Cineraria
hich in January, 1897, had only begun to open after 48 hours ; similar differences
‘Gecur with Salvia in a less definite degree. "8 What the meaning may be of the facts here given is not easy to say. The most
Sbvious analogy is that of nyctitropic plants, in which continuous darkness brings the
‘eaves into a fixed position which resembles rather the day than the night position. he existence of some degree of periodicity in the diurnal variation of the stomata
@nds probability to this view.
