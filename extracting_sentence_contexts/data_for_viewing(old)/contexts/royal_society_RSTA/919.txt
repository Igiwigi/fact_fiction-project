the effect of local transformations (such as a ‘swap’) by acting on another part of the composite
system, so that the pre-existing state of the whole is recovered with certainty. Using envariance,
one can even show that an amplitude of 0 necessarily implies a probability of 0 (i-e. impossibility)
of the corresponding outcome. One can also prove additivity of probabilities [42] using a modest
assumption—the fact that the probabilities of an event and its complement sum up to 1.

FAQ 8: Why are the probabilities of two local states in a Bell-like entangled state equal? Is the invariance
under relabelling of the states the key to the proof?

Envariance is needed precisely because relabelling is not enough. For instance, states can
have intrinsic properties that they ‘carry’ with them even when they get relabelled. Thus, a
superposition of ground and excited states |g) + |e) is invariant under relabelling, but this does not
change the fact that the energy of the ground state |g) is less than the energy of the excited state |e).
So there may be intrinsic properties of quantum states (such as energy) that ‘trump’ relabelling,
and it is a priori possible that probability is like energy in this respect. This is where envariance
saves the day. To see this, consider a Schmidt decomposition of an entagled state |Q)|<>) + |@)|&),

SThis is because, in a Schmidt decomposition that contains n such states with zero coefficients, one can always combine
two of them to form a new state, which then appears with the other n — 2 states, still with the amplitude of 0. This purely
mathematical step should have no implications for the probabilities of the 1 — 2 states that were not involved. Yet, there
are now only n — 1 states with equal coefficients. So the probability «w of any state with zero amplitude has to satisfy nw =
(n — 1)w, which holds only for w =0 [3].
