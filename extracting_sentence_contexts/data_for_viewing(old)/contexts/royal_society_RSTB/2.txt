little oblong or clavate masses, varying in colour from yellow to green or grey. A
vertical section shows a little peridium above, filled with threads and globose purplish
spores, remarkable for a border of long spines, all situated in the same plane. The
peridium is supported by a spongy central column, giving off threads which are
terminated by large globose bodies resembling closely the gonidia of Lichens, but
growing very much like the Palmella* figured at p. 118. Dr. Monraene has observed
these bodies to become blue with iodine, but this is not confirmed by myself or Mr.
Broome. I have, in fact, tried various preparations of iodine, and the addition of
sulphuric acid has given no blue tinge. The general colour of the plant does not arise
from these bodies so much as from the fine threads on which they grow. Increase in
many cases certainly takes place exactly as in the Palmella, by the division of the
central nucleus, and in one instance I have observed two of them to be confluent.
This very curious fungus was gathered by my son, Lieutenant Emertc SREATFIELD
BERKELEY, in his garden at Bowenpilly, near Secunderabad. I have named it
Emericella variecolor, and it is certainly one of the most curious that has ever come
under my notice.”

The plant. is gregarious in habit and resembles in external appearance such Fungi as
Diderma or Tubulina, and, although stated by Berketey to be on the confines of
Myzxogastres, is arranged by that author under Zvichogastres. The shape varies from
