After the pumping out of the gas, and without introducing a fresh quantity, dry air was
again admitted ; the swing produced by the dynamic radiation of the residue of the gas
(0:2 of an inch intension) was 99%. On pumping out very quickly, the dynamic absorp-
tion produced a deflection of nearly 40*.

A little of the vapour of sulphuric ether was admitted into the tube; on the admis-
son of dry air afterwards the needle swung from 0* to 61%; on pumping out, theneedle
ran up to 40* on the opposite side.

These and other experiments, which I confess gratified me exceedingly, showed that,
without resorting to any source of heat external to the gaseous body itself, its radiation
and absorption might be determined with extreme accuracy, and the reciprocity of both
phenomena rendered strikingly clear. In fact, at this very time T had been devising an
elaborate apparatus for the purpose of examining the radiation of gases and vapours,
with a view to comparing it with their absorption ; but no such apparatus would have
given me results equal in accuracy to those placed within reach by the discovery of
dynamic radiation and absorption.

The following Table is the record of a series of experiments in connexion with this
subject. The yapour in each case was admitted till the mercury column fell half an
inch, and dry air was admitted afterwards.
