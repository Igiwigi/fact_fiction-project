same time there are different sets of limits depending on the 28, displacements. The spectrum has not
been examined beyond m = 30, and from 14 to 30 the list indicates an allocation without further specifi-
cation. There is, however, much evidence not adduced here to indicate actual cases where sequence
displacement occurs. The calculated values for F, from m = 14 to 30 are 30238°21, 30297 -01, 30345°73,
30386 58, 30421-17, 3045068, 30476 +20, 30498: 14, 30517°35, 30534°18, 30549-11, 30562° 32, 30574-08,
30584°61, 30594-07, 30602°60, 30610°32, The deviation from the calculated values for F, (29) and
F, (29), which, however, gives the correct limit, shows that the sequent f(29) receives a large displace-
ment value, so large indeed as to totally alter its mantissa. The set must be doubtful. The whole set

are more likely to be (8,) F (30) and (—6,)F(30). In fact, in this neighbourhood, the difference of two
successive orders in a series is comparable with the change produced by a 4, displacement in the limit, and
so introduces some uncertainty in allocation. It will be noticed also that, in a few cases, the same line is
adduced to fit two cases, which can only happen if a line happens to be a close doublet, an unlikely
supposition to happen often.

We are now in a position to determine the limits with considerable accuracy.
Taking the average means where they are deduced from actual or displaced actual
values, we find the limits come to 80725°340, 32589°443, 33419°079. In the first
attack on the problem values of unobserved lines were deduced from observed linked
lines. The corresponding mean values for the limits then found had for the last digits
5°292, 97161, 8°918, very close to those determined from the displacements. The
individual deviations from the mean are quite small for F,(), considerably smaller
