Z be constituted wholly, or in part, of the longitudinal fibres of the posterior roots*.

AQ Upon anatomical grounds, then, it would appear, that the posterior white columns
are not, the channels of communication between the sensorium and the posterior
spinal nerves. Experimental evidence tends to the same conclusion. Both Van
Deen and STiLLING found that irritation of these columns excited no sensation

* That the cerebellum is in 8ome way coucerned in the regulation and coordination of muscular movements
appears to follow from experiment and pathological investigation ; but I think there are reasons for believing
that the mode of action usually assigned to it is unsatisfactory, and at variance with many well-established facts.
The discussion of this question, however, would be foreign to the present subject.

when their connection with the grey substance was interrupted. Nothing, however, is
more certain than that the posterior roots are in immediate connection exclusively with
these columns, which are separated from the antero-lateral columns by the posterior
