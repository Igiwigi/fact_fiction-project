bulb, with the result that the value obtained from the increased humidity will itself
be too high. As will be seen below, this is probably true of the number actually
obtained (35 millimetres).

A suggestion of Prof. Tynpaut’s was therefore ‘adopted, that use might be made of a
method described by Orme Masson (° Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vols. 74 and 78) and anticipated
by Crayton Brant (‘ Nature,’ vol. 49, p. 457 ; ‘ Chem. News.,’ vol. 71, p. 1, and vol. 73,
p. 180).

This method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed to damp air
absorbs moisture and warms as a consequence.

The temperature rises rapidly at first, reaches a maximum, and then tails slowly off
until, if the temperature of the surroundings is constant, it approaches its original
value. Using about 1 gramme of wool tied round the bulb of a thermometer, Masson
found that the maximum temperature was reached about half an hour after exposure
to the moist air, but the approach of the temperature to its old value lasted many hours.

To avoid the effects on the thermometer of variations in the temperature of the
surroundings, Masson put his apparatus in a water-jacket kept at a constant temperature
by a thermostat. This was impossible in the present work, but the same result was
obtained by shortening the period of changing temperature that follows exposure. This
