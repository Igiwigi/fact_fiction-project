the ciliated epithelium is never a 8ecreting epithelium ; 80 that in tracing the one form
into the other, there seems to be 8uch a marked transition in fanction (the mode of
production and the general conditions of development being essentially the same) as
clearly indicates that the ciliary action and the secreting agency, although yery

dissimilar in themselves, are both to be looked upon as modes of operation of the
same vital force as that which is exerted in the production of the cell. And this view
derives remarkable confirmation from the fact, that in the history of the © Zoospores”
of the Alge we have two distinet periods, one of ciliary action, and the other of growth
and multiplication ; $0 long as the ciliary action continues, which is provided for their
dispersion, no further vital change Seems to take place in them ; but 80 800n as this
ceases and they become stationary, they begin to exercise chemico-vital transformations,
and to grow and multiply as cells.

'These views in regard to the mutual relationship of the different kinds of vital
force, are strikingly confirmed by the phenomena of Nervous Agency. There can be
no reasonable doubt that the production of nerve-force in the central organs is de-
pendent upon the development of the peculiar cells constituting the ganglionic or
vesicular substance ; and, as already remarked, the progress of physiological inquiry
seems to justify the belief (long since entertained and expressed by the anthor) that
