ZYGOPTERID TREE-FERNS FROM WESTERN SIBERIA. 451

Of special interest was J. T. SreRzev’s label accompanying the fossil, which read as
follows :—

“ Rachiopteris ludwigii Lyuckarr et Scuenx. Aus Rotliegendem (?). Bei Semi-
palatinsk, Kirgisensteppe (Asien). Leuckart’sche Sammlung Nr. 96. Ueber Medullosa
ete. 1889, Taf. III, fig. 50. Asterochlena (Clepsydropsis) kirgisica SrenzE1,' Tubicaulis ’
1889, 8. 20, Taf. IV, fig. 38-44.”

Evidently, the identity of the two species was already known to SterzeEL, who was
for many years Director of the Museum, till his death in 1914, I am not aware that
either STeRzEL or anyone else has ever published the fact of this identity. One face
of this specimen showed the weathered upper end of the stem as originally found in
Siberia, the other had been cut and polished. On placing this slab on top of STENzEL’s,
I found that, while there seemed no doubt of their being parts of one and the same stem,
the two faces did not quite coincide as contiguous sections should do: apparently an

along a median crack. The longitudinal section at * must have been removed before the slab
broke into two, for the cut extends into the fragment B. Another longitudinal section was removed
at +, and a transverse one from the shaded area. The stem stele is confined to the corner x of B.
