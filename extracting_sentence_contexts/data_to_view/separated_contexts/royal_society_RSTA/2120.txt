Considering the cost of a single-item binding
(equivalent to 8x 1-bit full adder activations) from table 2 is given as ~5.8 pJ (note: this is a worst-
case result), the cost of the 8-bit multiplication would be in excess of 46 pJ. This excludes the AND
gates required by the Wallace tree input and any overheads in moving data in between steps. Thus, in the standard holographic approach our energy requirements for executing the example
problem would be:

E =3(yd)°46 pJ + yd(yd — 1) -5.8p]) © 635.4] (7.1)

We note that this improvement in performance is almost exclusively a result of the choice
of arithmetic operations used to execute binding (simple modular addition instead of circular
convolution) and the fact that we operate on compressed representations (we operate on length y
items, as opposed to full length yd chains). In terms of actual hardware design, we have been conservative and designed the CoPU
in 65nm technology. The best state-of-art computing system we could find was represented
by the Google TPU [31], where they quote 40W system power dissipation running at
92TOPS at 8-bit precision, thus yielding a power figure of just 0.43pJ/FLOP, which would
be equivalent to 0.43 pJ/binding in our system.
