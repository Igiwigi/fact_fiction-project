abscissee being temperatures in °C. In the first curve, starting from the left of the
diagram, each unit of the ordinate represents 10° ampére; in each succeeding
curve as we pass to the right the value of the ordinate is successively multiplied
by ten, so that in the last curve each unit is equal to 10~> ampére. To obtain the
saturation current per unit-area the values on the curve have to be multiplied
by 2°5.

The curves show that the negative ionisation increases very rapidly with the
temperature of the wire (in fact the saturation current varies roughly as the 70th
power of the absolute temperature). It will be seen that the current never vanishes
absolutely, but only in an asymptotic manner, so that it should be observable at any
temperature provided sensitive enough instruments are employed. As a matter of
fact at low temperatures it would of course be masked by other effects, which become
large by comparison. The curves seem also to tend continuously to an infinite value
of the saturation current ; but the theory indicates that at higher temperatures the
current would increase much more slowly with the temperature. This falling off of
the rate of increase has not yet been observed with any of the conductors which have
been examined.

We are now in a position to apply formula (7) to the reduction of the experimental
results. For the sake of convenience we may write for the number of corpuscles shot
off from unit area of the metal per second

N = (C/S8) = Aéte-’,
