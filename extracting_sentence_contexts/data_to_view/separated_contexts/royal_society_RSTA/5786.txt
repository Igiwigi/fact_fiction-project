However, one immediately realizes that this second set of macroscopic a
observables depends upon higher order moments of the distributions fj(x, t). In other words, in : 8
general, the system of macroscopic equations which can be obtained by integration of (2.22) over : &
the number of social contacts is not closed. In fact, system (2.23) depends on the time evolution :B
of x;(t), i= S,E,1, A, R while the system giving the time evolution of x;(t), i= S, E,1, A, R depend : Ss
upon second-order moments of the fi(x,t), i= S,E,1,A,R. This represents nothing else than the

classical so-called closure problem often encountered in kinetic theory [17]. However, letting t > 0 forces the distributions f;(x, t) to converge towards the Gamma vector
distribution of components (2.7) with mass fractions Nj(t), and local mean values x;(t), iÂ¢C =
{S, E, 1, A, R}.
