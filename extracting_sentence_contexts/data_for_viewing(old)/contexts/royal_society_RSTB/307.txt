and B; the ordinate o— denotes the maximum negativity of B manifested imme-
diately after injury ; the line —¢ denotes the gradually declining negativity of B.

I. represents a normal diphasie variation.
1st phase, A negative. 2nd phase, B negative.
II. represents a monophasic variation after injury of B; unbalanced negativity
of A.
III. and IV. represent diphasic variations re-appearing as the negativity of B
declines.
1st phase, A negative (major phase).
2nd phase, B negative (minor phase).

The facts of experiment are in complete agreement with this theoretical representa-
tion. With a normally beating heart in situ, led off from the apex to the mercury of
the electrometer, from the base to the sulphuric acid, the level of the mercury in
the capillary showed that apex and hase were iso-electric in the intervals between
the beats, each of which was accompanied by the double variation SN, signifying :—

1st phase, apex negative.
2nd phase, base negative.

The base was now injured by crushing with forceps ; on re-applying the electrode to
the injured base, the mercury in the capillary came to rest in the diastolic period
much nearer the end of the capillary (7e¢., North in the field of the microscope),
indicating negativity of the base; each beat was now accompanied by a single
