In this case, the only
option is to consider risk-hedging by promoting the establishment of different
species in different parts of the same landscape, in the certain knowledge that
some of them will turn out to be the wrong choices. The fact that some
adaptation decisions may be so awkward needs recognizing, particularly as
the likelihood of a 4°C world increases. However, this category of decisions
should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the majority of decisions is
less awkward. Most of these observations have been recognized in the academic literature for
at least a decade, but have not yet been integrated in a form that resonates
with and informs practical decision-making on adaptation. On the contrary,
in our experience of interacting with practitioners, much of the language used
about adaptation emphasizes once-off, small adjustments to existing practice
in which objectives are unchanged but pursued with climate change taken into
account.
