In Table I the occurrence and percentage of the different groups in the aboriginal
Australian are compared with those of the Southern Chinese from Hong Kong and
the Northern Chinese from the Pekin Union Medical College. I have included
with the Australian series the two hemispheres which Karpxius (1902) described,
and those hemispheres whose grouping can be determined from the figures of
Woo .tarpâ€™s paper (1929).

The first point to which I wish to draw attention is the difference between the
Sydney series and the remainder of the Australian Hemispheres. The Sydney series
was examined before I had access to the remainder. It will be observed that,
whereas every Queensland brain has a well-marked sulcus lunatus of some form or
other, this sulcus does not form an unusually prominent feature in the Sydney series.
In fact, the number of clearly defined sulci lunati is not greater than, if as great as,
one would expect to find in the brains of the Southern Chinese. Before having
seen the Queensland material I told Professor ELtior Smiru of the results of my
examination of the Sydney material. This is recorded in the Mott Memorial
Volume. The Queensland material necessitates a modification of the views expressed
at that time,
