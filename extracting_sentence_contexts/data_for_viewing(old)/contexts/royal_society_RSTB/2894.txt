the numbers 10 and 11 occur. The triarch character of the stele in our fossil,
however, makes such irregularities less probable.

At the node shown in text-fig. 1, several vascular bundles are present, leaving the
stele or traversing the cortex. The exact course of the leaf-traces, however, is
obscure, and this is one of the points which must be left open till more favourable
specimens are available. The fact that bundles are seen leaving the stele suggests
that the section shown in text-fig. 1 was cut rather below the node, and, therefore,
that the appendages shown are the dorsal lobes. This is not, however, quite certain,
for, from the radial section (phot. 9), it is evident that the bundles of the dorsal and
ventral lobes can only have joined quite close to the stele, and it is even possible that
they may have sprung from it independently.

The relative number and position of the dorsal and ventral lobes could not be
determined. At the node shown in detail in phot. 9, the ventral and dorsal lobes of
the sporophyll to the right appear to be placed almost vertically one above the other.
The dorsal is, however, cut rather more medianly than the ventral lobe. On the
opposite side only one lobe is shown, which seems from its position to be the dorsal
one; there is no sign of any ventral lobe ;* its apparent absence, which obliquity of
