Aprrnpix II.

Standard Graphs for Plotting Stream-Lines.—Vhe fact that the solution of the problem
of flow past an obstacle (equation (3.22) ) is expressible in such general terms enables
us to construct tables or graphs for the plotting of the equipotentials and stream-lines
in all such cases, provided that the “‘ fundamental net ” has first been obtained. We
give, in figs. 7 and 8, graphs of

cosh s cosr = ¢ (fig. 7)

and ; -
st sinh s snr = (fig. 8)
a which are essentially the conformally transformed equipotentials and stream-lines,
= the r-axis being the boundary. The unit in which r and s are expressed is 7/12, which
2 has been found convenient ; one “ quadrant ”’ of r is all that is given, but it is clearly
