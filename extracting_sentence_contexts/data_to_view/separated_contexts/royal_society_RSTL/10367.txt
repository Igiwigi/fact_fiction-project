Z (i.) Necessity for the application of force in order to change the position of
> the roller. S (ii.) Error in numerical results. Z (i.) The first of these is well known, and is in fact illustrated in an extreme case by

gevery mortar or pug mill. As the edge, which must initially have s0me appreciable

& thickness, however slight, grows wider, the evil increases, and the size of the roller

Zaltering the accuracy of its record is destroyed. This mus take place rapidly in the

Scase of the steam engine integrator, where such a wide range of motion occurs at

Zevery stroke of the engine.
