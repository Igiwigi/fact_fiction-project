In both
figures the ventricular tracing is above, the auricular below, and contraction pulled
the lever point down. Fig. 31 shows the effect of removing 120 e.cm. of blood from
one of the carotids. The ventricular contraction, as can be seen, becomes diminished
in force in spite of the fact that the lowered blood-pressure, offering less resistance to
the contractions of the left ventricle would of itself have led to increased systolic
contraction ; the ventricle also shows slight imcrease in the degree of diastolic
expansion. The auricular tracing shows marked diminution in force of the con-
tractions, which does not, however, go hand in hand with the weakening of the
ventricle, but follows a curve of its own. In Fig, 32, taken from the same heart a few
minutes later, can be seen the effects of reinjection of the blood which had been
removed, and which, during the interval, has been defibrinated and kept at the body
temperature.
