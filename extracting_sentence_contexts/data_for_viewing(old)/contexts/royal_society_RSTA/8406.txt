(b) “ Gaps” in System of Slip-Bands.—Reference to Table I will show that at one
stage of the test—when traces of one set only of slip-planes (111) were observed, two
definite gaps entirely devoid of slip-bands were observed on opposite sides of the speci-
men, These gaps can be explained and related to the direction of slip. If a specimen
of elliptical cross-section be distorted by shear on a system of parallel planes having
a common direction of slip, it is apparent that the direction of displacement of neigh-
bouring particles will vary from a direction perpendicular to the boundary to one
tangential to the boundary. Hence, if the polished surface of such a distorted specimen
is viewed through a (reflecting) metallurgical microscope, the intensity of the shadows
(representing the slip-bands) will vary from a maximum value through zero value to
the same maximum value twice as the specimen rotates through 360°. In the present
instance, the fact that the “gaps” observed had definite regular widths is explained
by the absence of a perfect surface and also by the limits of resolution of the
optical system employed. The slip-bands faded away as the gaps were approached,
and the width of the latter was approximately 0”-02. The positions of the centres
of the gaps could, however, be estimated with considerable accuracy, and were
found to coincide with the reference marks 2 and 8. It is easily shown that in such
a case the position of maximum intensity of slip-bands will correspond with the
ends of that diameter of the slip-plane which is parallel to the direction of slip, also
that the position of the gaps will correspond with the ends of the conjugate diameter
of the same elliptical section (the slip-plane). In the present instance, the spherical
co-ordinates of the diameter of the slip-plane, conjugate to that which passes through
reference marks 2 and 8 (i.e., through the centre of the gaps) have been calculated. In
