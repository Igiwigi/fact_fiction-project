A. DARCY ON THE

plasma-cell infiltration is more than a quantitative response to a certain intensity of break-
down of foreign tissue and that, independently of this, it has a specific connexion with the
immune response. This is supported by the fact that, although there is a large amount of
cell death in the original graft immediately after transplantation, the infiltrating cells do
not appear until about 6 days later (first-set grafts). It is further supported by the obser-
vation of Sanders (1950) that while frozen-dried killed homografts of nerve fail to immunize
a rabbit and to elicit a cellular response, if placed in an animal already immunized by
a live nerve homograft from the same donor, they then elicit a round cell infiltration. A hapten would appear to be involved here.
