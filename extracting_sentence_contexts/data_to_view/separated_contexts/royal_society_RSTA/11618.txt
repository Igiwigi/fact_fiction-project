Hence, for these values of \, we have

Tt follows from (14) that

. n?—K—T,,\
ha a (1- n—K—) as
and therefore from (13) that, as \ tends to — o, P (A) tends to a finite limit different
from zero,
Since P(A) and D (A)/A(A) both tend to finite limits different from zero, as \ tends
to — o, it is obvious from (12) that
n+m—1 / d

must be finite and different from zero. As this can only be the case when the number
of factors in the numerator is equal to the number in the denominator, it is evident
that m= 1.* Hence from (9) we have

eee We) aces me a (15)
As a corollary we deduce from (8) the inequality
|A,—(n—-1)?| <v

which was employed in IIT.,§17. This is primarily true for n greater than 7, but, by
a suitable choice of v, it is evidently valid for all values of 7.

* Previous investigators seem to have overlooked the fact that the yalue of m is not obvious, They
have all tacitly assumed m = 0,
