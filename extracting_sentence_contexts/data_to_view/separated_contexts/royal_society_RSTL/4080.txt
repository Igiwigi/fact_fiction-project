If the
Silver point be positive and that of the platinum negatiye, the latter becomes incan-
descent, and the silver one is much less heated. 'Thus, when the voltaic arc is formed,
the circuit must be regarded as completed, and then it is those parts of the circuit
which present the greatest resistance to the current which become the hottest ; at
first it is that portion forming the arc itself, and then, in the rest of the circuit, the
metal which is the worst conductor. But if the conductors be of the same material
on both sides of the arc, or if there be only a slight difference of conductibility be-
tween them, then the development of heat, instead of being uniform, as it might ap-
pear it ought to be, is much greater on the positive side. This important fact evi-
dently proves that this portion of the circuit has to resist a much more energetic
action than that which the other side experiences; a fact which is confirmed by the
molecular segregation accompanying this action at the positive electrode. This want
