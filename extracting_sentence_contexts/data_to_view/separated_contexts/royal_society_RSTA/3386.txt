It is only
when the pressure is much lower than this that a further decrease in pressure
produces a closer approach to saturation, until at a pressure of about a tenth of a
millimetre, depending on the distance between the electrodes, we actually get a true
saturation current which decreases with the pressure, approaching a finite value as
the pressure is indefinitely decreased,


454 DR. W. MANSERGH VARLEY ON THE PHOTO-ELECTRIC Except for the fact that at the higher pressures no true saturation current exists,
the sets of curves obtained can be simply explained by the ionic theory of conduction. We regard the metal surface illuminated by ultra-violet light in a similar manner to
a hot surface, and suppose that negative corpuscles escape from the surface under the
influence of light, and, in the absence of any force tending to drag them further,
simply diffuse back into the metal. If now the illuminated surface is negatively
charged, a field is set up and the corpuscles are enabled to escape, and a state of
equilibrium will be established when the total number of corpuscles given out by the
metal is equal to the sum of the number finding their way to the positive electrode
and the number diffusing back into the metal; and, as the field is increased, the latter
number will become small compared to the former and we shall get a saturation
current—neglecting, of course, any complications introduced by the presence of the
surrounding gas.
