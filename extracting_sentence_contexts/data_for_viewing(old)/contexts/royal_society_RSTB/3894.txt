The sub-zone of Offuster pilula contains the depressed form of this species (p. 121),
and the large ossicles of Pycinaster magnificus. Large forms of Culliderma Smithia
and Tholaster ocellatus are also fairly common,

The Fauna of the High Zones—

The horizons included under this designation are the sub-zone of Actinocamax
quadratus, the zone of Belemnitella mucronata, and the Danian.

It is universally conceded that the zone of Marsupites indicates the period of
maximum subsidence of the Chalk Sea. Uplift then took place. The distinction
between the “mid ”- and “ high ”-zonal faunas is possibly brought about partly by the
fact that the uplift caused some redistribution of the faunal provinces. The uplift

was not uniform throughout the Chalk Sea, but occurred so that the land in the
West emerged from the sea at an earlier date than that in the East. This accounts
for the greater thickness of the “high” beds in Norfolk, Denmark, Sweden, and North
Germany, <A further result of the direction of uplift was probably to make the
western end of the sea much more gulf-like in nature. In consequence a severer
competition between the forms living in this area arose. The available area was
diminished and disturbance of provincial faunas took place. We may take as an
example of this the distribution of members of the Stawranderaster Boysiti sevies.
