Again, the
rapid decrease of é gives that Bsrll L~({-2,2)') > 0 as s > 00, and for a similar reason the second
integral vanishes as well. We can therefore conclude that |5o(€) = |€|~!/2(1 + e(€)), where e(&) > 0
as & — oo, and consequently:
il

6 (0, ka)? = el (1+ gtka)),  g(k2) > 0, kz > 00. (4.5)

We now have:

since there are o(2i ) frequencies kz in each dyadic shell and the largest term in the sum of order
21-7 by (4.5). The uniform bound (3.9) follows from the fact that the symbol of e e , is uniformly
bounded in « and ¢ in L®. Lastly, the convergence of 6* to 09, which is the unique solution of
the transport equation with data 6 is a direct consequence of the strong continuity of the heat
semigroup in LP 4 BS a

We turn to showing that anomalous dissipation holds for 6*. Theorem 4.3.
