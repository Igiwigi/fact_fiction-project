the availability and the quality of forage available to certain
herbivores [43-45]. Fire and herbivory are both amenable

to manipulation by people, and the human impacts on

fire and herbivory regimes globally have reverberated
through diverse ecosystems, altering trophic structures and
reassembling ecological communities [5,6,46,47].

One key way in which fire and herbivory differ is their
selectivity. Fire has often been characterized as the ultimate
non-selective herbivore [48,49]. In fact, the ideal fuel/forage
for fires and herbivores are different [50], as anyone who
has seen a fire delicately picking its way through a moist
fuel-bed would agree. For herbivores, high-quality forage
represents green leaf material with a low C:N ratio and a
high bulk density (biomass concentration [51-53]). Given
these constraints, herbivores will be more/less selective
depending on their body size and gut type (figure 1a).
For fires, a high-quality forage (flammable fuel) is very dry,
has a low bulk density and a high C: N ratio [60]. Fires can
be highly selective (only burn dry fine fuels) or less selective
(also burn wet material and coarse woody fuels) depending
on the fire intensity (figure 1b). Finally, fires require conti-
