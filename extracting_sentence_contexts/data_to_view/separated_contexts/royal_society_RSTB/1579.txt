Cansidored salely from an anatomical standpoint, and with the qualification which
the absence of direct experimental evidence imperatively demands, it may be
atlirmed that Hasse’s theory is carrect, anid that ihe Weberian mechanism is a
pressure register serving to acquaint the Fish with the varying tensions or yolumes
of the gases contained within its aiv-bladder, the result of corresponding variations
of the hydrostatic pressure, As it is inconceivable that such pressure yarintious ean
arise from any other cause than the ascent or descent of the Fish in the water in the
eourse of the ordinary locomotor movements, it may be further concluded that the
Weberian mechanism is related to some form of pressure adjustment,

4. If the conclusion at which we have arrived be adroigsible, the further question—
Whot: advantage does the Fish derive from the possession of «a pressaye register by
which it becomes acquainted with the varying degrees of hydrostatic pressure to
which it is exposed? or, In what way does the antl respoud to the sensory impulses
communicated to ils central neryous system by the Weberian mechanism and the
co-adapted parts of the internal eur! is one to which ib is very difficult to retara a
satisfackory answer. That the Weberian mechanism is of great functional importance
to the Vish possessing it admits of no doubt. [1 is extremely improbable that so
complicated aud highly specialized a mechanism would have been evolved did it not
confer some exceptional advantage upon its possessors, and that this is the case seenis
to be clearly demonstrated by the significant fact that the presence of a Weberia
mechanism is characteristic of nearly all the dominwit families of freshwater Telesstei,


ON THE ANATOMY OF FISHES. 285

Sime light may possibly be thrown on this difficult question by a closer comparison
of what is experimentally known of the methods of pressive adjustment in Fishes in
general, ane in the Osturiophysem, than has hitherto been made; and if no satis-
factory conclusion can be arrived at in this way, some clue at least may be gained u&
to the dircetion iu which the solution of the problem must be sought fur in the
‘fotune. Gaseous secretion and absorption are, as we haye seen, highly important factors in
the mijonity of Fishes iu the adjustment of the volume of gas iu the aiv-bladder
to varying hydrostatic pressures, and the conditions under which these pressures take

ace, have been experimentally investigated by Morrau, Of the conditions which

jariine an increasé in the rate of secretion of gas into the air-bladder, the most:
“Boportant are (1) repeated abstraction of gas; (2) increase of external pressure ;*
j) section of sympathetic nerve; and (4) the presence in the walls of the bladder
WM special vetia mirabilia, or “ vaso-ganglia.” The process of absorption, on the
her hand, is not so well understood, but certain conditions undoubtedly favour
Sts action; these are (1) diminution of pressure, and (2) the existence of retia
Biirabilia. Té will be obvious that the repidity with which the amount of gas in au
fir-bladder can be augmented or diminished by secretion or absorption, is an
‘“nportant feature in this disenssion, for on this will depend the capacity of the Fish
“Bi adjust itself to the yarying pressures of dilfarent levels in ordinary locomotion ;
unfortunately Morgau’s experiments do not throw much light on the precise
‘Bite at which these processes take place.
