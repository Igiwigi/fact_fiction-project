kind of asymmetry will have to be preserved across all
the counterfactuals related to that explanation. This points
toward another lesson one could take as well: it is the role of
counterfactual dependence in explanations. If we take these
lessons, a clearer path emerges when it comes to the solution
of the asymmetry problem in topological explanations,
namely, the counterfactual dependence is a structural feature
of explanations that is available in both causal and non-
causal explanations. Given that many philosophers argue
that topological explanations are non-causal, because their
explanans does not cite any causes, but rather mathematical
properties of network topology [1,26-32], then appealing to
causation or causal facts is not an option for solving the asym-
metry problem in topological explanations. A better way to
approach the problem is to inquire whether the counterfactual
dependence in topological explanations can account for
explanatory asymmetry. In his recent paper, Lange [33]
argues that in several available counterfactual accounts of
non-causal explanations, including the one espoused by
Jansson [25], the counterfactual dependence alone is not
sufficient to account for explanatory asymmetry. Jansson’s con-
tribution to this theme issue [9], takes up Lange’s challenge
directly, by focusing on the conditions of application in non-
causal explanations. In the next section, two more possible
bases of explanatory asymmetry in topological explanations
