The appearances commonly seen are those represented in figs. 5 and 8, but these
sections are more or less oblique to the axes of the pits; if the section happens to
more closely coincide with their axes, the appearance shown in fig. 11 is seen, where
the Tomes’ processes are seen to enter and fill up the pits.

To the exact relations of this honeycomb to the ameloblast process I shall have
oceasion to recur later ; for the present, it will suffice to point out a peculiarity in
the honeycomb, which is, that it is most conspicuous at a certain stage of enamel
formation, that is to say, near to the ameloblasts, but that in the somewhat older
enamel it is lost and cannot be seen at all.

This, which is at first sight puzzling, is, nevertheless, easily susceptible of explana-
tion ; it is a familiar fact to every student of calcification, that just upon its border
line it is very common to meet with a half-calcified material which is very resistant
to reagents, and which is very possibly a form of Harting’s caleoglobulin (4).
Such structures are to be found forming the linings of the dentinal canals as
Neumann’s sheaths, round the lacunz of bone, round the Haversian canals of bone,
and, as a fenestrated membrane on the surface of developing human enamel when
it has been treated with an acid.

But when calcification has proceeded a little further, it loses this power of
resistance and dissolves in acids. So that in the case of enamel, we have first the
coherent ameloblasts, then a short region in which the Tomes’ processes stand isolated
from one another, then the honeycomb; and, lastly, in the region of older enamel,
