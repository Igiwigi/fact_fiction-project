MAITRE JEAN, LEVEILLE, and others, suppose
that it takes place through the chalaze; and LeveiLLe has
even pretended to demonstrate the tubular structure of one
of the chalazz. This tubular structure has been denied by
some Writers, and particularly by Dr. MacarTxey,* who
even appears to doubt the fact of the intermixture in ques-
tion. After what has been said, however, there cannot, I
think, be much doubt of the circumstance ; and future in-
quirers on this interesting, but difficult subject, will do well
to turn their attention to it. Experiments on the egg at the end of the second week, or about
the 15th day of incubation.
