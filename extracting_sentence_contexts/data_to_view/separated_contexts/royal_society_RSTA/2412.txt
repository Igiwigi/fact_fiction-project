At T > Tc, the remarkable point with respect to the thermoelectric properties is that the value
of S at 300K is not affected by the Fe concentration. S can be described as T+T'/? for all the
samples, and its value is almost independent of x. The large value of S previously discussed in
CoS of approximately equal to â€”42 1 V K~! at 300 K could be due to the fact that Ef sits on a steep
slope of the Density of States (DOS) according to [14]. As shown in figure 6, the Fe substitution is efficient to reduce the thermal conductivity in
the whole temperature range, down to approximately equal to 7.9Wm~!K~! at 300K. This
reduction is mostly induced by electronic contributions coming from the increase of electrical
resistivity.
