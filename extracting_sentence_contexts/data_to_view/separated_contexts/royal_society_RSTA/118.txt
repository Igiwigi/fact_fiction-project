In particular cases, more in-
formation can be obtained by direct application of lemmas 1, 2 or 3. We return to this point
in ยง4.

3. SOME FULLY REDUCIBLE STAR BODIES

All the star bodies which we mentioned on p. 313 as being bounded ly reducible are in
fact fully reducible. The method which will be used to prove this is a straightforward modi-
fication of that of Mahler, and rests on modified forms of theorems K and L, and definition
D of Mahler (19464). We denote these modified forms by accented letters.
