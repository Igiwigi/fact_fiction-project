Many celebrated mineralogists, amongst whom may be men-
tioned the Abbe Havy, seem to explain this want of crystalli-
zation in calcedony, by considering that substance as nothing
more than quartz in a concrete state. This is, in fact, supposing
it a sort of irregular crystallization, which bears the same anaÂ»
logy to quartz, that calcareous alabaster bears to crystallized
carbonate of lime. I cannot, however, by any means adopt this
opinion, as it does not appear to me to agree with those facts
which nature permits us to observe; for, not to mention those
kinds of quartz which are produced by a disturbed crystallization,


triple Sulphuret, of Lead, Antimony, and Copper, &c. 4g

for instance, granulated quartz, both of a fine and of a coarse
grain, quartz in stalactites, &c. we are acquainted with several
kinds of trueconerete quartz, which forms veins in primitive rocks,
in the same manner as carbonate of lime forms veins in secondary
rocks. All these substances have the appearance peculiar to
quartz, and show nothing that is at all analogous to that appear-
ance which s0 strongly characterises calcedony; the latter, also,
pos8esses a degree of hardness superior to that of any of the
others, Besides, quartz in a concrete state is often found acci-
dentally mixed with martial argill; a circumstance that, as is well
known, frequently happens to calcedony. Inthe former case,a true
Jasper is formed, which has a quartzose base, instead of having,
as in the latter case, a base of calcedony.
