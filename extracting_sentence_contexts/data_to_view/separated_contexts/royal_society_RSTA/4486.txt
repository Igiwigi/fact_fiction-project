That there is a significant divergence from normality

ds also indicated by the sensible difference between the percentage errors in y, and o,
Shich would be equal for a normal distribution. Had we taken a normal distribution,
the probable error of the mean would have been ‘0400, and of the standard deviation,
"2831. In fact, the standard deviation of the standard deviation, if caleulated for
€he normal curve = ‘04197, if calculated by our present method = ‘044246, and if
falculated by a modified form of the fourth moment formula given by CzuBER*
= 044240. This shows that the arithmetic of our process has been substantially
orrect. 6
