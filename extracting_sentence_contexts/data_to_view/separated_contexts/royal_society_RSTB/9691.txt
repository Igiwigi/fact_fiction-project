The picture that emerges is one of a eusocial insect society
that has more in common with cooperatively breeding ver-
tebrate groups, in which the presence of non-relatives is
widespread [38,39], than had previously been conceived. Like
their vertebrate counterparts [39], cofoundress associations are
shaped and maintained by both direct and indirect fitness com-
ponents. Unrelated helpers are therefore more likely to be
symptom of the fact that direct fitness benefits can maintain
cooperation [38] than just a maladaptive by-product of kin rec-
ognition errors. Moreover, such direct fitness benefits may well


have played a role in precluding the evolution of a committed cofoundress associations. The work discussed above has con- 5 |

worker caste in primitively eusocial groups; it makes no evo- sidered individual nests in isolation.
