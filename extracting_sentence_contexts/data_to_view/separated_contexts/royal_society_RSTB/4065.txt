WILLIS ON THE ENDEMIC FLORA OF CEYLON. It being, then, assumed that not only, on the whole, do age and commonness go
together, but also age and wide distribution, we may now proceed to follow out the
probable course of development of the different systematic groups. According to
the hypothesis proposed in my former paper, taken together with the interesting
facts which have been set out in the present contribution, a species probably starts
on a small area as one or more individuals, and from that area spreads by aid of its
dispersal mechanism. Under the influence of natural selection, modified very much
at first (¢.e. in the earlier stages) by chance, but less in proportion later, the species
will spread, gradually occupying a larger and larger area of the earth’s surface, so
long as there remain places suited to it within reach.
