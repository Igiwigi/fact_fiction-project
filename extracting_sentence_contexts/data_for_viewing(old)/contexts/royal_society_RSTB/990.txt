outer wall (fig. 7).

In consequence of this, a superticial examination of the uterus discovers free b

In conjunction with the existence of these large lacune and the consequ
stretching of the epithelium, the glands at this stage are widely open, and in
instances their epithelium even is thinned.

The pushing inwards into the cavity of the uterus of the interglandular mat
doubtless produces the force which pulls the walls of the glands widely a

It is very generally noticeable that the largest lacunz are in the region of a g
