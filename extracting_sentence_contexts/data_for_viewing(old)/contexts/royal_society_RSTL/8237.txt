Table. The fact may then be simply stated, that in the case of lead the complexity of
the spectrum increases as the atomic weight of the non-metallic element with which it
is combined decreases.

BARIUM.

The next metal experimented on was barium, an element of much lower atomic weight
than lead, and in this respect, occupying a position not very much above the mean atomic
weight of the elements. It was s00n found that the facts obseryed with lead did not
completely hold with regard to barium, although they include the phenomena presented
by the chloride, bromide, and iodide. Even with these salts, however, the phenomena,
though the same in kind, differ 80mewhat in degree. For instance, the same number of
metallic lines was observed in all these salts, and between the appearance of the chloride
and the bromide spectrum there was no appreciable difference. In the case of the
iodide, however, there was a sensible change in the direction expected from the behayiour
of leadâ€”4. e. the spectrum became dimmer, that is, exhibited a tendency to die out.

When, however, baric fluoride was examined, a different state of things was observed.
Instead of the spectrum becoming more complex it became simpler, exhibiting in fact
only the four longest lines of barium with any degree of distinctness, and these showing
but little brilliancy.
