(d) Bonamiosis

By 1979, the French flat oyster industry, already hit by
M. refringens, was devastated by another protozoan, Bonantia
ostreae. Like most members of the genus, B. ostreae can be
transmitted directly among oysters; thus movements of
seed or adult oysters, and even larvae [83], from enzootic
regions are potential sources of infection. The well-documen-
ted history of transfers of flat oysters, and likely the parasite,
too, from California to France and Spain, and thence to
other regions of Europe, has been previously described [28].
Bonamia ostreae prevalence is greatest during warm months,
but infections show no strong seasonality [83]. In fact,
in vitro experiments showed greater survival of the parasite
at 4-15°C than at 25°C [84]. Density and handling stress
appear to enhance infections, which develop more rapidly
in cultured than in wild stocks [29].

In 1986, the New Zealand dredge oyster, Tiostrea (Ostrea)
chilensis, suffered a loss of at least 60% in the area of Foveaux
Strait. By 1992, only 9% of the stock that was present in
1975 remained [85]. The causative agent was identified as
B. exitiosa [32], which was subsequently identified in oyster
samples collected in 1964 [33]. Since then, the same pathogen
has been detected in several species of oysters in North
