The resistances of the
various parts of the telegraph wire through which they pass vary with the varying tem-
peratures, 80 that it is quite reasonable to expect that, eyen when no change is taking
place in the absolute value of the current travelling in the earth, the needle of the
galvanometer may move forward or backward according as sunshine or cloud, heat or
cold prevail here or there in the district under examination, 'This opinion is sanctioned
in some degree by the result of some night obseryations made on October 28—29, My
original observations were almost wholly made by day. On the night in question obser-
vations were made eyery ten minutes from 10.10 y.x. to 6.50 4.x, During this period
there was evidently an excess of S.W. currents ; the proportion of v, d, u to d, u, d currents
was 1: 2-7, whereas the day proportion for the month was 3:7: 2:7. Als fifteen out of
the twenty-five d, d, 4 currents were collected during the night; in fact there were only
ten 4, d, 4 currents in the whole fifty-six night observations. From 11.40 p.m. to 5.40 a.M.
the London-Dover wire collected a continuous down &4 current, varying more or less in
intensity ; from 5.40 to 6.30 A.M., the current was too feeble to be appreciated; at 6.40
it was found in the reverse direction v, and was 80 when the obseryations were inter-
rupted at 7.47.—These remarks in passing. There is no consistency in the relations between two derived currents collected at the
same time from the same earth-drift of electricity : this may be in great measure due,
as I have hinted, to local meteorological interference, if not to the absolute differences
