The seven methods shown in red (light grey in print version)
(lower case labels) use the nonlinear model in the reconstruction, while the other five methods (upper case labels) use the
linear model. From top to bottom, the methods are constraint using (1) non-negative matrix factorization projections, (2) mixed
wavelet sparsity and non-negative matrix factorization projections, (3) mixed wavelet sparsity and low-rank matrix factorization
projections, (4) wavelet tree sparsity, (5) wavelet sparsity, (6) low-rank matrix projections, (7) positivity, (8) total variation
regularization, (9) wavelet tree sparsity and (10) wavelet sparsity. The second to last results are those achieved with ART [1]
and the last results are those for FBP. (Online version in colour.)

results in the light of the fact that we are unable to calculate exact projections onto the union
of these two constraints and the fact that our algorithm is primarily designed for subspace
models (which the non-negative factorization is not) shows that the two constraints are capturing
important complementary properties of the data. This demonstrates that there is a need to study
these joint constraints in more detail in the future. The only linear cost function-based result that is not matched by the nonlinear methods is
the linear approach with the TV constraint.
