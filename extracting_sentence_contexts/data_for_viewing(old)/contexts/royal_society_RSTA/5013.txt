Of course we can see how far away Faraday, and others, were at this time from understanding
the true nature of electric current by the way he still refers to the different kinds of electricity.
He defines five distinct types: Voltaic-Electricity (as produced by a battery), Common-Electricity
(such as the discharge from a charged body like a Leyden jar), Magneto-Electricity (by which he
means an induced current), Thermo-Electricity and Animal-Electricity (such as was known to be
produced by some creatures such as the electric eel).

It should be mentioned at this point that the American scientist, Joseph Henry (1797-1878),
whose life, starting from poor and humble beginnings, in many ways mirrored that of Michael
Faraday, was also working (independently) on electro-magnetism on the other side of the
Atlantic — although interest in the subject was certainly circulating across the Atlantic by the 1830s.
Importantly, it is worth stating that Henry in fact beat Faraday to the discovery of inductance by
a few months in 1831, but it was Faraday who published first and, despite the delays that so
frustrated him, is therefore credited with the discovery.

4. Faraday’s mistake

Today, every schoolboy and schoolgirl learns about Fleming’s left- and right-hand rules. These
useful visual mnemonics were developed by the English engineer, John Ambrose Fleming (1849-
1945) in the late nineteenth century and give a simple way of working out the direction of motion
