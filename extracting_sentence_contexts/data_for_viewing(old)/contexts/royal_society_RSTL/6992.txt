Â® barrel of a pen cut slantingly or lopsided, instead of bilaterally symmetrical as they are.

XI. The two sets of fibres which constitute the superficial or first external layer of

2 the left ventricle, and which enter the left apex in two separate portions or bundles, are

- for the most part continuous in the interior with the musculi papillares, to the free
ends of which the chorde tendinez are attached. These columns occupy different
2 portions of the left yentricular cavity, and give a very good idea of the symmetry which
prevails throughout the left ventricular walls.

Lastly. The apex is opened into and enlarged, and the auriculo-yentricular orifice
widened, by the removal of consecutive external and internal layers, from the fact of
the left ventricular cavity tapering in two directions and forming a double cone.

There are other points worthy of mention, such as the construction of the septum,
fleshy pons, and conus arteriosus, the varying thickness of the right and left ventricular
walls, the shape of the right and left ventricular cavities, &. To these, however,
allusion will be more conveniently made subsequently.

As the structure of the ventricles, with one or two exceptions, is the same in all
mammals, man included, I have chosen to describe the arrangement of the fibres in the
ventricles of the sheep and calf, from the readiness with which the hearts of these animals
may be obtained. My descriptions, however, will by no means be confined to them.
