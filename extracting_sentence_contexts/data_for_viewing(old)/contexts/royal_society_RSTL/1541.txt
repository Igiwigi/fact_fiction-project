press a gradual and strong increase of brightness towards the
center of a nebulous object of a round figure; having also a
faint chevelure or coma of some extent, beyond the faintest
part of the light, gradually decreasing from the center.

It seems that this species of nebulz contains a somewhat
greater degree of condensation than that of the round nebule
of the last article, and might perhaps not very improperly
have been included in their number, Their great resemblance
to telescopic comets, however, is very apt to suggest the idea,
that possibly such small telescopic comets as often visit our
neighbourhood may be composed of nebulous matter, or may
in fact be such highly condensed nebulz.

From the third degree of visible condensation, I have in the
215t article intimated, that the length of the time of the action
of the attracting principle, would explain the observed gradual
