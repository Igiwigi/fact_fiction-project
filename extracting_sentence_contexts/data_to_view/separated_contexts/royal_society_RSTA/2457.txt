In practice this technique has
not yet proved commercially viable, and no such plant exists at present. Burning coal, with its
associated sulfur dioxide emissions, is also a serious health hazard by any standards. Geothermal and hydro share with coal, oil and gas the fact that they are not uniformly
available over our Earth in the quantities needed to provide base-load power. Gas pipelines can
partially overcome this but carry the risk that supplies can be cut for political reasons. Electricity
interconnectors carry a similar risk, and until we have an interconnector circling the globe there
is the problem that cloudy, wind-less weather can persist over whole continents!
