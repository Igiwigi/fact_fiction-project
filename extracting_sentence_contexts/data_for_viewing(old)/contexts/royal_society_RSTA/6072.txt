to make such an identification possible, assuming a ~ O(1). Should this be the case, it would
imply the potential presence of quantum gravitational effects at the LHC, an issue considered
already in the past decade within the framework of additional spatial dimensions [11].

Actually, considering the central role that the equality of inertial and gravitational masses
play in GR, it is strange that the (inertial) mass, m, appearing in the scalar field Lagrangian,
associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking and excited by particle collisions at the
LHC, would be so different from the Planck mass Ma, ~1/G that occurs in the gravitational
Lagrangian. The disparity of these two masses is known as the Hierarchy Problem in high
energy physics [9]. Compounding this issue is the fact that loop diagrams of the scalar
field appear to diverge quadratically with the upper energy cut-off. An attempt to bring
these two mass scales together was proposed in [11], at the expense of introducing, hitherto
unseen, extra space dimensions, while [12] employed these ideas to explain features of the
cosmic ray spectrum at the appropriate energies (similar to those considered in [10]). The
point suggested in the present note and in the above discussion is that, in a not yet fully
understood way, these two mass scales have a common origin in the same dimensionless
gravitational constant but manifest themselves differently at different spatial or energy
scales.
