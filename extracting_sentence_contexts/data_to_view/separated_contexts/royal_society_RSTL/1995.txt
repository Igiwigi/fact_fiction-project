But the reyerse was the case. He
quotes Mr. LzsL1s as to the hopelessness of success, without making a further
attempt ; © since a black body almost always differs from a white in one or
more chemical properties, and this difference may alone be sufficient to occa-
sion a diversity in their powers of radiating heat,”

PART II.

ON THE INFLUENCE OF COLOUR ON ODOURS. Ir the influence of colour over heat attracted but little the attention of phi-
losophers employed in the investigation of the absorbing and radiating powers
of different substances, even when presented to their notice in anomalous
facts, which could not easily be explained on any other principle, it is not to
be wondered at, that the apparently far less appreciable influence of Colour on
Odours should have totally escaped notice. In point of fact, I am not aware
that the subject has hitherto been investigated, and know of no recorded facts
in which the influence of colour over odours has been pointed out. In at-
tempting to show from experiment that the colour of bodies in imbibing
odours is correlative with the power of colour oyer the absorption and radia-
tion of heat, I state a fact which, though new to science, is in admirable cor-
respondence with the known properties of light and heat.
