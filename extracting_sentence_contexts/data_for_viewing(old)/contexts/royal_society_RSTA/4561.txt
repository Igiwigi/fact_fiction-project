Climate sensitivity—the eventual temperature outcome based on a doubling of carbon dioxide
concentrations in the atmosphere—is the key parameter determining long-run global average : a
temperature outcomes and, thus, the costs of failing to take significant steps to mitigate future 1
climate change. Doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere is not hypothetical. [fg
Current concentrations of around 400 parts per million (ppm) are already up by 40% over pre- aoe
industrial levels of roughly 280 ppm. At the current rate of increase, pre-industrial levels will :s
double well before the end of the century. :

The title question is also not hypothetical. Some apparently new facts have led IPCC (2013)
to reconsider the full implications for long-term equilibrium warming and have led it to widen fo
the ‘likely’ range, once again, to 1.5-4.5°C. In addition, the IPCC removed its prior ‘best estimate’ :
of 3°C. a

Unambiguous conclusions are hard to reach in this arena where uncertainties are large. Bearing =
this caution in mind, our analysis strongly suggests that, other things equal, the IPCC’s recent {8
widening of the ‘likely’ range of temperature change by reducing its bottom value may well :
increase appropriately calibrated WTP to avoid such change in the future. The same holds for Da
the removal of the ‘best estimate’. Given the increasing marginal costs of global warming, greater Dw
uncertainty raises the return for taking action to curb greenhouse emissions. Recent steps in the :
IPCC’s assessments reflect greater uncertainty. a
