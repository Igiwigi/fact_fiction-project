PHENOMENA WITH RESPECT TO LIGHT.

The prismatic crystals of corundum, as well as the pyramidal
ones, when their extremities are terminated by faces which are
perpendicular to their axes, very frequently have those termi-
nal faces chatoyant. This property is the natural effect of the

* I had finished writing this Paper, when Mr. Gaeviile had the curiosity to
cause one of the hexaedral prisms of imperfect corundum, from the coast of Malabar,
the terminal faces of which exhibited the concentric hexagons above spoken of, to
he cut transversely, This section sbewed a: very interesting fact, and one that adds
some probability to what I have $aid respecting the cause which produces this pheno-
mencn. One of the parts of this crystal (which crystal is sawed into three, and po-
lizhed,) exhibits the appearance represented in Fig. 38, A. The whole substance of this
segment is of a pale purplish-red colour ; but there is, in its centre, a triangular spot,
Similar to that represented in the above figure, which indicates very clearly that the
Section was made below the summit of the primitive rhomboid, and perpendicularly to
its axis. This spot is also of a purplish-red colour, but much more deep than the rest
of the crystal, and therefore strikes the eye very forcibly. It is only to be perceived
upon one of the terminal faces ; the other terminal face does not show the smallest
trace of it. There may, however, be perceived at its centre, a hexagonal plane, nearly
as large as that represented surrounding the spot in Fig. 38, A; it is of a different
colour from the other part of the substance of this segment, being of a dirty gray.
