very remarkable phenomenon will be witnessed (Plate 19, fig. 19). If the air-spark
be of a snitable magnitude it will be found that one of the tubes is wholly traversed
by the discharge, but that the other is occupied only by a luminous column extending
from the positive terminal into the tube for a considerable portion of its length, and
gradually tapering to a point. If the air-spark do not exceed a certain limit, depending
upon the © resistance ” of both tubes, there will be no luminosity at the other end of
the tube, and no discharge through it. No effect will be produced upon the luminous
column, nor on any portion of the discharge, by breaking the connexion with the
distant terminal, showing, what the appearance of the column itself sufficiently indi-
cates, that the discharge is unipolar or incomplete. Slight indications of blue haze are
sometimes 8een ab the tip of this tapering column, due probably to some negative
electricity gathered from the neighbourhood, but not directly discharged from the
opposite terminal. The discharge is, in fact, one which passes into the tube but not
with sufficient force to pass through it, and which accordingly returns by the way by
which it entered. The cause of this recall we shall examine hereafter ; for our present
purposes it suflices to point out, the fact that here we have a discharge from one pole
which is unable to approach near enough to the other -pole to get relief there, and

actually prefers to return by the way it came rather than to pass through the tube to
the other terminal. Such discharges we shall term unipolar discharges.
