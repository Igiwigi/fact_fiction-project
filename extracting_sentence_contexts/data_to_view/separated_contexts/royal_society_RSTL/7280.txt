In a former paper on the Guineaworm® I alluded to the various accounts that had been
given concerning the anus and the termination of the intestine in the young contained
within this animal. Amongst others I mentioned the description which Carter had
given of the intestine terminating * at the root of the tail,” near what I have described as
lateral saccules and he as a gland. I had een another disposition of the intestine 8
plainly that I was inclined to believe CaRTER must have been mistaken ; and it did nok
occur to me that the discrepancy in our observations might be fully accounted for
by the fact of our having examined young animals at different stages of their deve
lopment. Now, however, I feel assured that this is the most probable explanation of
the former discordance in our views, since in three or four Guineaworms of different
8izes which I have since examined, I have found a difference in the degree of develoy
ment presented by their contained young ; and in one animal I found them in a more
advanced stage than I had ever before seen, displaying the intestine communicating
with the exterior by an anal orifice in the very situation indicated by CartTER—that is
to say, slightly above the level of the lateral sacculi (Plate XX VII. fig. 22, a).
