showed in our previous paper, movement of the fingers occurred very slightly in
degree and very late in time, and the character of this late and feeble movement
was flexion. This fact we have now confirmed in our re-examination of the border
centres 6 and 6’ (situated between the upper and lower limb centres).

(b.) Primary.—Of 11 movements,

4 were flexion,
3 ,, extension,
4 ,, abduction of the index.

The rarity of primary movement of the fingers here indicated is explicable by the
fact that in the ascending parietal gyrus the movements of the fingers are almost
universally secondary to those of the thumb. Thus of fifteen absolute movements of
the “all fingers” (7.e., excluding primary movements of the index), only 1 was a
primary movement, and that was associated with the thumb. Reference also to
the plate in our former paper and to fig. 14 shows this important preponderating
influence of the thumb.
