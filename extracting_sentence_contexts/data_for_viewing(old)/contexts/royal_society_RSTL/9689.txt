obtained by its explosion in 40 per cent. space (as given in Table TIT., page 215) with
those in the general series (Tables I. and 11.) furnished by the same powder, fired in
the same space. In the one instance 22:87 per cent. of sulphate were found, in the
other it was barely half that amount. With 8uch variations occurring in the propor-
tion of sw{phate formed under like conditions of explosions, it can hardly be matter for
surprise that variations of the same kind should occur in the proportions of suIphide
and hyposulphite. In fact, in the two parallel experiments now referred to, the
amount of sulphide contained in the residue rich in sulphate was only about one-fifth
that contained in the other residue, the proportion in this being higher than any in
the three series of analyses. Be it observed, at the same time, that this high amount
cannot be ascribed to the adoption of any special precautions to prevent accidental
oxidation of the sulphide in the special experiment in which it was found, as there
were several residues in the series furnished by pebble powder (of the same composi-
tion as the R. L. G.) which contained proportions of suIlphide not much lower than in
this particular case.

Two other parallel experiments (39 and 96) with R. L. G. conducted in 60 per
cent. space, exhibit, on the other hand, a remarkably close concordance in regard to the
proportions of sulphate and hyposulphite (the numbers being almost identical), though
