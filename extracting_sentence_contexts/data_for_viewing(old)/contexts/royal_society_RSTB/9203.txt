nized with MRSA over a six-month period were suspected but
not categorically proved to be linked. WGS analysis of MRSA
isolates from the SCBU and elsewhere not only confirmed that
the cluster did indeed comprise an outbreak, but that it was
more extensive than originally envisioned, with transmission
of the outbreak strain between mothers on a postnatal ward
and in the community also being found [92]. Conversely, in
another study, apparent instances of patient-to-patient trans-
mission of MRSA in an adult intensive care unit identified by
spa typing of isolates from patients with overlapping stays
were found to have been incorrectly identified when subsequent
WGS analysis showed that the isolates from ‘epidemiologically
linked’ patients were in fact genetically distinct [93].

Understanding the epidemiology of colonization and
infection with antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria is
particularly challenging as the spread of resistance is not lim-
ited to the transmission of bacterial cells but may also involve
the inter-species spread of the genes encoding resistance on
mobile genetic elements such as plasmids. However, studies
are already being published showing that WGS has the
potential to unravel the complex epidemiology of such
infections, including the emerging and critically important
problem of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant organ-
isms [94,95]. With the cost of WGS falling, some investigators
