Similarly, in gels one may contrast the behaviour aes
of oscillatory BZ gels, pioneered by Yoshida [6], in which the BZ dynamics drive the remarkable 22
chemomechanical behaviours observed, with the systems studied by Boissonade [7] and Horvath [4
et al. [8], in which a mildly nonlinear (spatially bistable, but not oscillatory) kinetics interacts with : >
a pH-responsive gel medium so as to generate chemomechanical oscillations. : =

In this paper, we explore whether extremely simple chemistry, ic. adsorption and desorption :3

of a single chemical species onto a porous solid whose porosity varies nonlinearly with surface
coverage, can result in oscillations. In our treatment, only one reversible elementary chemical
reaction step is involved, and complicated chemical feedbacks such as those encountered in
the BZ reaction are excluded. We develop and analyse a two-variable model for such a system,
which one might dub the ‘poroscillator’, and demonstrate that oscillations can in fact arise under
appropriate conditions. We first describe the elements of the model and the corresponding set of
rate equations in a rather general way. This allows us to derive the broad conditions under which
the model might allow oscillations.
