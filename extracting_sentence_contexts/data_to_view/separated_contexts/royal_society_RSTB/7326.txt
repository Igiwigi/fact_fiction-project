Traps placed in the area will therefore not be ignored to the same extent as when suitable
and sufficient carcasses are available. For a more detailed account of the use of traps as a means of gauging fly populations,
reference should be made to the paper by Davidson (1933).

6. Summary of main facts
In spite of the drawbacks associated with the methods employed in recording field
populations of blowflies, certain information has been obtained and is summarized here,
since it will be used in the discussion which follows.
(1) The four species exhibit definite seasonal trends, both in their breeding period on
carrion and in the incidence of their adult fly populations in the field.

(2) They may be divided into two seasonal groups, viz. (a) Summer breeders: C. albiceps
and C. marginalis. (b) Winter breeders: Lucilia spp. and C. chloropyga.

(3) In traps, the maximum abundance of C. albiceps and C. marginalis occurs during the
summer and coincides with the breeding on carrion. The corresponding periods in the case
of Lucilia and C. chloropyga occur during summer and therefore do not coincide with
maximum larval breeding.

(4) During winter, C. albiceps does not occur on carrion and the fly population is
extremely small.
