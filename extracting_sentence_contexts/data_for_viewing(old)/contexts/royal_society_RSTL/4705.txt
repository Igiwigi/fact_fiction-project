and consequently the quantities a, b, c, f. g, h, are not independent, but are connected
by the equation
abe—af?—bg*—ch*+2fgh=0,
an equation, which is in fact verified by the foregoing values of a, &c. in terms of the
coefficients of the given system.

The expressions for the symmetric functions of the third degree considered as functions
of a, b, c, f, g, h, are consequently not absolutely determinate, but they may be modified
by the addition of the term a(abce—af*—bg*—ch?+2tgh), where A is an indeterminate
numerical coefficient.

The simplest expressions are those obtained by disregarding the preceding equation
for tgh, and the entire system then becomes—
