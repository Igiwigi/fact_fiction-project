For small
times after the onset of the Turing instability, the Turing modes delineate the rough spatial
structure (shape and size) of the nascent Turing pattern, before nonlinear effects then refine the
pattern. To determine the evolution of the kth Turing mode coefficient vector V;(t), we multiply (3.22)
by one eigenfunction #;(x) and then integrate over the domain,

a | Oyvdx= pj DV - (d(x)Vv) dx + | J (x) ®xv dx. (3.6)

Using the representation (3.5) for v and the orthonormal property of the basis, the first term
reduces to mw Using the representation (3.5) for v, the orthonormal property of the basis, as well
as the divergence theorem, and noting that all eigenfunctions (x) satisfy (3.4), the second term
reduces to —pxDVj. Finally, using the representation (3.5) and the fact that generalized Fourier
series may be integrated term-wise, the third term becomes vole P(x) Py (x)](x)dx)Vn. We

then arrive at the equation of evolution for the coefficient of the kth mode,

dv =

We write the Jacobian matrix in the basis of eigenfunctions, as J(x) = ) 29 Je®e(x), where Je

are constant real-valued 2 x 2 matrices. In order for this expansion to converge, we assume


that the matrix norms ||J¢|| satisfy, 729 \Vell2 <a < 00 for some finite 0 <a < 00. (We use the
Frobenius norm or Euclidean norm for all matrices and vectors in this paper.) Defining the Wigner
coefficients (eigenfunction triple products) Cmne =Jo Din (x) Pn (x) Ge (x) dx, we may then define
Imn = fo Pm(x)Pn(x)J(x) dx = 29 CmneJe.
