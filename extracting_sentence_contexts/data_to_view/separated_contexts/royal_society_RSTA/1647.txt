T(t) is a contraction semigroup on 5,(X). The fact that T(f) maps B)(X) into itself and it is a
contraction is obvious. The fact that T(t) is a semigroup is less obvious. It can be proved rewriting
T(t +s), for t,s > 0, as

T(t +s)f(x)= I. Fle)4x + w)(ur 0 (84)7! # Ms)(dw), fF € By(X), xX,

and checking that ju; 0 (4) 1 «ys = 14s, or else recalling that T(t) is the transition semigroup of

where W; is any cylindrical Wiener process on X.
