On the inner (upper) surface of the member, the
cuticle is less thick, but the cellulose walls of the epidermis more massive, and the
zone of fibres consists of finely woven slender elements. About } mm, from the edge
sclerosis ceases, and these special features are lost as the leaf thins to the margin. The special interest of the histology lies in the fact that between the two regions
all transitional stages are present ; and it is possible to trace the sliding growth, wavy
course and thickening deposits of the sclerites within the limits of a single longitudinal
section. In the axils of these members arise singly, in the accurate median line, what are
regarded as the ovuliferous or carpellary flowers, as definite stalked axillary formations :
the whole cone being a bi-axial structure. Few will object to this obvious inter-
pretation.
