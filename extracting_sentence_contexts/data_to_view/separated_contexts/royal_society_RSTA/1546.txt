The main results include: (i) similarities
and differences of SR in triple and double cavities; (ii) differences between SR in triple cavity


and triple potential; (iii) influence of boundary parameters on SR; (iv) influence of external
forces on SR.

(a) Similarities and differences of stochastic resonance in triple and double cavities

In the past decade, SR in confined cavities has been studied and many interesting results have
been presented. However, most studies fix the confinements as structures with two channel units,
only pay attention to influences of boundary properties, noise properties and particle shapes, and
rarely extend the results to cavities with more or less units except for a brief analysis in [43]. In
fact, n versus D in these cavities also shows an interesting trend. Therefore, in this part, a double
cavity +w(x) = (0.3x4 — 0.6x2 — 0.06) with the same scale as the triple cavity (2.2) for a given set
of a2, a4 and ag is constructed, as shown in figure 1. 7 in both cavities is calculated to indicate the
similarities and differences of their SR. Figure 3 depicts relations between 7 and noise intensity D for different values of G, Fo and
Q in the triple and double cavities.
