That the growth does take place along vicinal planes has been abundantly
proved, at any rate for alum, in the preceding pages ; that the spacing is very much
wider in the liquid than in the crystal has been proved by showing that the liquid
about to crystallise is scarcely more than saturated. Very slight variations in the concentration of the solution would probably
correspond to considerable differences in the vicinal planes produced.

. The observations recorded above raise many interesting questions; but I have
thought it better to confine myself in this paper mainly to observed facts, and to
reserve further speculation for another occasion, hoping in the meantime that the
enquiry into the nature of the liquid in contact with a growing crystal, which is here
opened, will be pursued by others in a more systematic and exhaustive manner. Note.—A briet statement of some of the results recorded in Part I. (pp. 459-492)
was published in the Report of the British Association for 1894, p, 654. In the latter part of the research I have received useful help from my assistant,
