2. Background 18

Ice pressure is defined as the pressure acting on the interface between the structure and ice edge.
This definition immediately awakens two main questions. Firstly, why ‘ice edge’? When a level
ice sheet drifts against a stationary structure that offers a vertical side against the ice, the meaning
of ice edge and its geometry is clear. When a ship proceeds in level ice, the geometry of the edge
is less clear. The ice edge arises from the repeated ice failure in bending, which leaves the ship to
collide repeatedly on the edge of the newly broken ice.

The second question is related to the ‘interface’. It sounds clear that there is a direct contact
between ice and the outer shell of the structure. The fact that ice often fails by crushing, i.e. being
broken into a granular material containing also very small ice particles, obscures the idea of a
direct contact that is defined to occur between intact ice and the structure. There may be a direct
contact in the interface and also contact through the crushed ice.

Local ice edge cracking can also create a contact that is smaller than what is usually described
as the nominal contact area. The nominal contact area is the area where the contact would be if the
geometries of the structure and the ice feature were extended to the contact without considering
deformation or especially cracking. Practically, all the models for ice pressure use the concept
of the nominal contact area to define the ice pressure; see, for example, the collection of models
in [2]. It should be noted in passing that most formulations use the so-called projected nominal area.
This is the nominal area projected on a tangent plane of the contact that is normal to the relative
velocity.
