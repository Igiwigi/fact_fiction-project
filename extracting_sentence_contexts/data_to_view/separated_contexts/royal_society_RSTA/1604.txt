By assumption (H,), u cannot belong d2,. Therefore, we are in the position to
apply the Continuation theorem 2.5, obtaining

|DL(L â€” N, 2;)| =| deg(F, 2, 0 ImP, 0)|,
where

Thanks to condition (Hin), property (f;) and the definition of f, it follows that F(c) <0 if c <0,
F(0) =0, and F(r) > 0. Therefore, as a basic fact in degree theory, one has
deg(F, 2; 1 ImP, 0) = 1,

and this implies, by theorem 2.5, that problem (1.5) admits at least one T-periodic solution u in
,. Any T-periodic solution is non-negative and, if non-trivial, strictly positive in R. However, the previous computation does not allow us to understand if (1.5) has only the trivial
solution or also some positive ones.
