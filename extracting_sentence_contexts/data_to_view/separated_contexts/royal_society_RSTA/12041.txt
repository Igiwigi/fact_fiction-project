At lower pressures the rate
3 falls off, but above a certain crucial pressure, which, in the case of hydrogen and
8 oxygen, seems to be about two atmospheres, the velocity is independent of the
pressure. Q It will be observed that the mean rate of explosion of hydrogen and oxygen at
1500 mm. pressure is appreciably higher than Berruetor’s 6—the calculated rate of
translation of the steam molecules. But BerTHEnor, in his calculation, has not taken
into account the fact that the gases are not at absolute zero to start with. Assuming
that he worked at about 13° C., the theoretical rate would be 2900 metres per
second,

Analogous results were found in experiments with other mixtures under varying
pressures. With hydrogen and nitrous oxide the rate is slower at 500 mm. than at
760 mm., but no increase is found on raising the pressure to 1000 mm. ‘The crucial
pressure is in this instance below the atmospheric pressure.
