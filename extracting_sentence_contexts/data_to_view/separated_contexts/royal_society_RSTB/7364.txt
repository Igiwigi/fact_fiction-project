Thus, in wet smears
of the undried preparations an outline (‘ghost’) of the whole cell, retaining its original
oval shape and containing a nucleus in the centre, can sometimes be seen, while in
preparations treated with alcohol or completely dried a fine jagged protruberance, evidently
consisting of part or all of the stroma, juts out from the surface of many, but not all,
nuclei. The proportion of nuclei retaining stroma can, we believe, be considerably
diminished by vigorously stirring a suspension of the nuclei from the final saline washing
in 4 % acetic acid, straining through muslin and repeating the treatment on the centri-
fuged material with 1 % acetic acid. We have, in fact, adopted this procedure in most of
our preparations. One disadvantage of the use of haemolytic agents lies in the apparent
ability of the nuclei to retain a small quantity of them. That saponin is so retained has
been shown in some unpublished determinations of furfurol-yielding substances which
