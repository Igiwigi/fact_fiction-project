they appeared in the attachment of the bud. In connection with the possible
relation between the buds and archegonia, the structure shown in fig. 61, is of
interest, This was situated just where the prothallus continued into a bud, which
had formed from the apex. The neck of the archegonium projected above the
surface, but in its withered state it was impossible to decide whether it had opened
or not. Within the venter the ovum is seen divided into three cells. It is impossible
to state definitely that this division did not follow fertilisatior, but the fact that a

bud developed apogamously, and the absence of normal embryos from the rest of
the culture, render this improbable. Further, the fact that a group of small cells
occupied a similar position further back, on the same prothallus, lends weight to the
view that the division of the ovum had occurred independently of sexual fusion.

Besides numerous examples of the apogamous development of a normal sporophyte,
this culture yielded a number of prothalli in which the characters of the two â€”
generations appeared more intimately mixed. Isolated ramenta occurred on the
gametophyte ; in fig. 62 a single ramentum is seen on the under surface of a
prothallus which also bears a bud, In the example represented in fig. 63 two large
ramenta were situated on the anterior margin. They stood on either side of the
base of a narrow, flat continuation of the prothallus, which terminated in a bud.
Since sexual organs and rhizoids were absent from this intermediate region it must be
regarded as approaching the sporophyte in structure though no tracheides were
