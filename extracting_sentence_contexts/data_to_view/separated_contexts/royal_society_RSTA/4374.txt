(e.) An argument from means, as to whether fertility is inherited or not, is very
likely to be misleading. We may choose two groups from the record for comparison,
neglecting the fact that their frequency in the record is not necessarily that of their
frequency in the general population. Thus, if one person, say, in four were married,
a marriage record of the community might exhibit the proper frequency of families
of four, but it would not do so of families of one. The sort of fallacious arguments
we have to be prepared for are, for example :

(i.) That the fertility of the community is diminishing, because M’, is less
than M’,.

(ii.)
