it is covered.  Existing, as we shall subsequently see, in nearly all the fossil species,
they obviously play an important part in the economy of the scale, by keeping up a
free communication between its upper and lower surfaces. They are not confined to,
or even chiefly found in, the anterior portion of the scale, which, when in situ, is em-
braced by the thick duplicature of the skin, but in that part of it which is free, and
which has beyond doubt been covered over with a thin secreting membrane like a
periosteum, and which has received some of its supply of blood through these open
canals, by means of anastomosing blood-vessels, ascending from the integument,
below. About the posterior two-thirds of each scale is covered over with a layer of
ganoin. In some._ parts this is 80 thin as to be scarcely visible, figs. 14 and 2F,
whilst in others it is developed into irregular tubercles, fig. 2g. From the latter
representation, we See the way in which these tubercles of ganoin are formed. They
are, in fact, prolongations of the upturned edges of the bony lamelle, running
towards the centre of the scale, but only covering small portions of the surface,
instead of uniformly extending over the whole, as we shall afterwards find to be the
case in Lepidotus and other fossil forms. We see from this, that each lamella of the
ganoin was formed contemporaneously with that of the bone from which it springs;
each lamina, shown in the drawing, consists of a number of more minute lamellee,
as has been already observed in reference to the osseous portions. With the excep-
tion of the tubes, of which the orifices have been already alluded to as perforating its
laminz, I bave not been able to detect any other microscopic structure than these
lamellz in the ganoin.

I snbjected some of these scales to the decalcifying action of dilute hydrochloric
acid, and obtained a dense flexible tissue, preserving all the original contour of the
