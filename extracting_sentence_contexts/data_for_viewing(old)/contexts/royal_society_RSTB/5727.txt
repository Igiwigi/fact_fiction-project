(2) F broods, mainly dextral with a few sinistrals, are much less frequent ;

(3) we have had a number of dextral broods (“ dextral break-throughs *’) leading to
pure or heterozygous dextral lines which have arisen in pure recessive groups,
sometimes after two or three generations of self-fertilising sinistrals.

We attempt to show below that F broods (p. 120) and dextral break-throughs (p. 116)
represent an actual breakdown in the system, i.e. they are the produce of new
mutation which under our conditions occurs rather commonly. Since we know (e.g.
DrMeEREC, 1928) that reverse mutations of this type do sometimes occur with very
high frequency, it might be reasonable to suppose that the dextrals in EK broods were
attributable to the same cause or to an anomaly involving direct segregation within
a brood. This is in fact not the case: E broods are sinistral broods containing pheno-
typic dextrals, and they represent not a breakdown, but a modification of the system.

Between the three types of anomaly there is this common bond, that dextrals, some
genotypic, some phenotypic, tend to appear where sinistrals would be expected.

(1) E Broods and « Groups and Strains.

By definition a K brood consists entirely of sinistral snails. An E brood is a mixed
brood of sinistrals and dextrals obtained from a'self-fertilising single,* in which sinistrals

* Or from a pair in an ¢ strain of established constitution.
