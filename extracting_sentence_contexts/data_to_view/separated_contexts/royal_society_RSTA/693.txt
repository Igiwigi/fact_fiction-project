of hematite at around 294 and 408cmâ„¢!, the low signal to noise ratio makes the identification
challenging. The application of helium led to an increase of the signal to noise ratio and four
hematite bands are clearly observed at 230, 294, 408 and 606 cm. Besides the fact that a helium jet protects the object from heating damage, the reduction of
the luminescence background on the Raman spectra is a very desirable side effect. No clear
explanation has yet been formulated to explain this reduction in luminescence background. Two
processes have been proposed.
