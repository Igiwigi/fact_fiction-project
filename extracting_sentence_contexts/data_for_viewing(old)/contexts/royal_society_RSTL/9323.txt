of liquid, or the solubions of acetate, propionate, and butyrate contained 50*8, 61'6,
and 725 per cent. of the respective salts. The acetate and propionate formed super-
saturated solutions.

Single and double thicknesses of liquid were examined. In Diagram No. 2 is shown
the effect on the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum due to three 8uccessive members
of a homologous series of acids. Kach solution contained a molecule of the sodinm
salt of the acid. The two series of observations 1 and 2 represent the action of
single and double cells or thicknesses of 4 and 14 inch respectively. It is particularly
sbriking how the second series of observations shows a regular decrease in transmitted
rays caused by each increment of CH, in the molecule.

The same fact is again noticeable in Diagram No. 3, Plate 23. Here, in order to get
rid of the inconvenience caused by the change of alkaline formates into oxalates on
evaporation, we made use of very beautiful specimens of barium salts. In this case
the formate is. the most transparent of salts, and it may be seen that the acetate bears
the same relation to it in transparency that in the case of the sodium alt the
propionate bore to the acetate.

A glance at Diagram No. 3 will show that a cell-full of the acids corresponding to
the ethylic and propylic alcobols, which we have every reason to believe are perfectly
pure substances, are less diactinic than the alcohols as shown in Diagram No. 1, which
fact points to the carboxyl group in the molecule possessing a special absorptive power
greater than that of hydroxyl. We have further evidence of this in the shorb
spectrum of oxalic as compared with acetic acid. The specimen examined was pre-
