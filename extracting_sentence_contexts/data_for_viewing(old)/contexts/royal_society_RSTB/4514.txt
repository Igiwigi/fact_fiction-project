with the lighter work, more by increasing the depth than by increasing the rate of
the respiration. That the hyperpnoea in the later stages of the work in these
experiments is not excessive in comparison with that observed in the case of lighter
work, is shown by the fact that the average volume of expired air per 1 c.c. of CO,
given off is in Douanas’s case, 25°2 ¢.c. in the experiments with work of 704 kg.m,
per minute, and 26°9 c.c. in the experiments at 1056 kg.m. per: minute, Hopson
giving values of 24°6 c.c. and 24°7 ¢.c. respectively (observations which show an
abnormally high respiratory quotient being excluded as before).
