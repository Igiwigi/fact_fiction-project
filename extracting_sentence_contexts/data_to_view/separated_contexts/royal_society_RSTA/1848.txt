The T86 and T94 deficits are larger than the T85 and T93 values,
respectively. This is related to two factors. Velocities decrease with distance from the Race
Rocks region so arrays situated further west are in fact located further downstream (i.e. T85 is
further downstream than T86). Potentially more significant, ebb-tide velocity values increase with
distance from the sandbank.
