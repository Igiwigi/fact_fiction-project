After addition of the drugs at
ordinary temperatures, the blood darkens in colour more quickly if it be propyl-
aldoxime than is the case with ethylaldoxime, and more quickly still if it be the
isobutyl compound. At the body temperature the change takes place much more
rapidly, In fact, on the addition of isobutylaldoxime to blood at 40Â° C., the colour
almost immediately darkens. Strong solutions of these two aldoximes also decom-
pose the blood, with extrusion of the colouring matter from the corpuscle. This latter
process can be watched under the microscope, when there is presented the appearance
of the red blood corpuscles shrinking, and so causing the pigment to be squeezed out
in granular lumps.
