S The eastern end of the profiles in figure 12 should be considered in conjunction with
= chart 6, which shows the regional isostatic anomalies for T=30, R=58 km. A representa-
‘g tive selection of Jolly’s (Bullard & Jolly 1936) observations on land have also been included,
€ and isostatic anomalies for these have been computed on the nine different hypotheses used
‘3 throughout this paper. As the anomalies do not vary greatly from one system to another
S chart 6 gives a good idea of the general trend over the area. With one exception, the values
§ are all positive and the land stations show a marked increase to the west, reaching +55
& mgals in the Outer Hebrides. The submarine observations indicate that this trend does not
extend much beyond St Kilda.

It is not easy to account for the positive field found in this area. The only relevant geo-
logical fact is that the islands have apparently undergone continuous submergence since
the ice age. This indicates a return towards isostatic equilibrium but does nothing to explain
why the original uplift occurred. A possible explanation would be that at one time an
upward convection current existed below this region. Cooling, owing to convection or a
diminution in the source of supply of heat, possibly because of erosion of the areas raised by
the current, has now brought the circulation to a standstill or even reversed the current.
We are left with an excess of matter and a tendency for the crust to sink. The tertiary
igneous activity found in the Inner Hebrides is possibly connected with the increase in
