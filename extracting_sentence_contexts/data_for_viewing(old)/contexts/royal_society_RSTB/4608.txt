3 and sterile castes concern the shape and size of the head~ and mouth parts, the

5 presence or absence of wings and the condition of the eyes. Since we can have no

8 conception, in the absence of experimental evidence, as to what the various allelo-

3 morphs are likely to be, it is necessary to consider the distinctive characters of each

Sof the three castes in toto as collective entities ; or, in other words, to deal with

quantitative rather than qualitative segregation. Furthermore, this method of

= treatment receives justification from the fact that these various characters are

g intimately correlated and linked together. We do not find, for example, the giant
mandibles unless accompanied by an increase in the size of the head and the absence

3 of wings. Nor do we find the modified tentorium without the presence of an elongate

ยง labium, and both these features are, in their turn, correlated with the enlarged head
and mandibles.

Ales propose to consider first a typical species of Termite comprising monomorphic
soldier and monomorphic worker castes and the ordinary winged sexual forms. Let
the symbols ASF represent the various allelomorphs which express themselves collec-
