While precise measurement of real-world infant and
parent behaviour is thought to require direct observation
(see, e.g. [43]), such measures of the home musical environ-
ment are costly and, given their logistical complexity,
typically have only been used in small samples. By contrast,
parent surveys concerning the use of music with infants are
feasible at a large scale, as in prior work using nationally
representative phone surveys [38,39].

Studying parents at scale is essential to ensure the general-
izability of findings to populations of interest, but also because
the behaviours in question may in fact vary as a function of
family characteristics that may not be captured in small
samples of convenience with parents. Indeed, diminished
resources found in families with lower socioeconomic status
are negatively correlated with parenting practices, such as
book-reading [44]. The evidence for such effects in music so
far is mixed: Custodero et al. [38] found that more educated
parents tended to sing and play music with their children
more than those with less education, but found no relation
between parentsâ€™ musical behaviours and income or ethnicity.

Further, there are a variety of other effects of interest, raising
questions that studies of broad samples of families can address.
