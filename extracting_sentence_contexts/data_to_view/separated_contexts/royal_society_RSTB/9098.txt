Introduction

The order Primates is a remarkably social taxon, with the majority of species
exhibiting year-round associations between adult members of both sexes. This degree of sociality stands in contrast to the typical associations found in
other mammals, whose sociality largely involves females associating with
immature young; adult male and female associations typically occur only
when females are receptive [1]. The fact that primate sociality has evolved
over tens of millions of years [2] suggests that their sociality is embedded in
a basic way in their biology. This is, perhaps, most evident in central nervous
system organization, in which areas of the brain appear specialized for processing
explicitly social information (e.g. [3]). Primatesâ€™ sociality is also integral to their physical health.
