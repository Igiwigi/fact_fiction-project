Hence we desire to stop the integration when

Now p="6659 ; hence when E='516, N=1'329. In order to integrate the equation of obliquity by quadratures, T assume the four
equidistant values, F

I——_ (N—1)(1:502) the corresponding

And by means of the equation E=1—

values of & are found to be

Then by means of the formula > = the corresponding values of = are found

to be
+0909, 1388, 2395, *4951

I agsumed conjecturally four values of 5 lying between #=15* 22' and 7=14®, which
I knew hs be very nearly the final value of 7; and then computed four equidistanb
values of — = logyy tan

The values were
-19381, £16230, 11882, =—-00684. The fact that the last value is negative shows that the integration is carried a little
beyond the point when 4 cos 7=29, but this is unimportant. AND ON THE REMOTE HISTORY OF THE KARTH. 505

Combining these values by the rules of the calculus of finite differences, T find
23=13" 59%

This final value of & (viz.: 5179) makes the moon's sidereal period 12 hours, and
the value of IN (viz.: 1321) makes the day 5 hours 55 minutes. These results complete the integration of the fifth period.
