Assuming now the axes of coordinates to be rectangular, we know, from formulze
(I.) in section 24 of Chapter IT., that det (Q, Q) has for its components
q.-7,—04,7. parallel to Oz,
4:7.—4:7, parallel to Oy,
9,7,—4., parallel to Oz. Therefore it follows from the preceding section, that the components of D, (Q) are

These formulz are in fact simply the analytical expression of the fundamental propo-
sition in the preceding section, and correspond exactly to the formule in section 18 of

Chapter I.

particle. Suppose, then, a particle to move in space in any manner whatsoever, and swpp'
inates revolve about a line Q at time # with angular velocity

©, @ being the length of Q. Let v,, ?,, v, be the components of the particle's velocity,

and @,, w,, w, the components of Q. Then, since the velocity is the complete differential
coefficient of the radius vector R of the particle, and since &, y, 2 are the components of

"These formulee simply express the fact, that the absolute velocity is equivalent to the
relative velocity together with det (Q, R).
