VNS, together with rehabilitative therapy, also enhances functional motor recovery after
traumatic brain injury in animals [88]. VNS activates neuronal and astrocytes a7nAchR, and
inhibits the apoptosis and oxidant stress responses possibly associated with increased Akt
phosphorylation and miR210 expression [89].

VNS has also been linked to cardiac diseases [90-92]. These diseases, in fact, still have
a high mortality rate owing to neurohormonal activation and autonomic imbalance with
increase in sympathetic activity and withdrawal of vagal activity. VNS could be a viable
solution to counteract the sympathetic tone and enhance the vagal tone, with applications for
heart failure, atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease induced by increased sympathetic
nerve activity [90,91,93]. The improvement in heart failure and the anti-inflammatory and
vasodilatory properties of VNS provide additional antiarrhythmic benefit [94]. VNS, in fact, acts
on proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide elaboration and myocardial expression of gap junction
proteins [95,96].



Of note, conventionally, the left-sided cervical vagus nerve is mostly selected as the site
for stimulation because of safety concerns [91,93]. Regarding changes in the ECG morphology,
elevated levels of T-wave alternans were found in patients with drug-refractory partial-
onset seizures following VNS [97]. Moreover, pure ectopic cycles were observed during sinus
arrest caused by VNS [98]. Remarkably, this effect has been suggested to profitably discern
between parasystole and extrasystole events in case pure ectopic cycles are not spontaneously
observed [98].
