For determinations in the vicinity of fixed points at low temperatures the method
employed by Nernst is an admirable one and his experimental values carry great
weight. a

He has given, in the cases of silver and lead, the results of investigations at
higher temperatures (e.g., at —78° C.), but these determinations cannot, for several
reasons, be regarded as satisfactory. The validity of this conclusion is indicated by
the fact that individual values at the same temperature differ by about 4 per cent. PART I
