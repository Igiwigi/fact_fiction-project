With the
small coil, these revealed no inconsistency, but with the large coil a different value of
E was obtained when the coil was rotated through 180° although the method cancels
out the effect of stray flux through the search coil in each position. The effect was
attributed to a capacity current flowing from the search coil to the sheet which altered
its path and presumably its value as the switch was thrown over from position 1 to
position 2. In fact a condenser connected from search coil to sheet increased the dis-
crepancy. Since this capacity current produces an effect in the same direction when
the coil is rotated through 180°, while the field due to the cable is reversed, the difference
between the results in the two positions should separate out an effect of this kind. This was found to be the case when an artificial capacity effect was introduced, so the
procedure was adopted in all readings with the large coil.
