Our neural implementation of an analogue of Peano’s succes-
sor function, a fundamental requisite of arithmetic, should
not be confused with the successor function familiar to devel-
opmental psychologists, i.e. the laborious acquisition, during
childhood, of a system of exact number symbols 1, 2, 3...
linked through counting. While our model accounts for
how human and non-human primates, as well as other
species, can be innately endowed with approximate number
vectors, much remains to be understood about how these vec-
tors are linked, on the perceptual side, to sets of objects, and
on the abstract side, to symbols such as Arabic numerals or
verbal number words. In fact, because the number states in
our theory have exponentially vanishing distances, it is
doubtful that exactly the same mechanism could be recycled
for exact numbers, where the distance between consecutive
numbers would presumably need to remain constant.

(c) Levels of description

Although our theory for the origins of number vectors includes
realistic properties such as Dale’s principle, sparsity of neural
activity patterns and sparse and distance-dependent connec-
tivity, it describes brain activity at an abstract mathematical
level similar in spirit to the classical Hopfield model for
