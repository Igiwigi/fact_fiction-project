However, the decrease for 3 to 5 years after peak numbers had been passed
cannot be explained by the amount of overcrowding during the period of maximum
juvenile mortality. It seems more likely that, as in the vole, the descendants of crowded
animals were suffering from physiological derangements derived in utero from their parents. A progressive reduction in viability in each of the generations born during and after the
period of peak numbers fits the observed facts well. On this assumption an acceleration
in the total juvenile death-rate is an inevitable result of the dying out of the older, least
affected breeders. If it is true that intraspecific competition alone can account for periodic decrease in
snowshoe hares we next have to explain why other species have a cycle of similar length,
roughly in phase with that in the snowshoe hare.
