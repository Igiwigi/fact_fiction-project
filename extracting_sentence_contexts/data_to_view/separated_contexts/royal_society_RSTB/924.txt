Even after enclosure, the onward movement
eression is characteristic, and, the phase of quiescence being ended (usually)
 Bypical movement of aggregation, retrogression follows. Finally, after a pause
iB “area of solution,” discharge takes place from the anal ridge. Only in
‘uration of these several events, and in the really important details, the
ppings to this bare thread of movement, can we trace the fact that innutritious
#gr does not stimulate the cell substance of Carchesium so effectually as does
gible food. tothe first place, the time of enclosure is short. I will not anticipate the more
ed statement on this point which is to follow, but will only say that this
iBution does not affect the first periods I have distinguished.
