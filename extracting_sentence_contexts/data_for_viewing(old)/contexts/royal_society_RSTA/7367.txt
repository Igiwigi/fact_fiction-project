Assuming that the value of the porosity lies between 50 and 75 % (Kuenen 1950), and that
the constituent mineral particles have a density of 2:7 g/cm’, the mean density on the
lower side of the interface will lie between approximately 1-8 and 1-4 g/cm’. The ampli-
tude reflexion coefficient for equal velocities will be independent of angle of incidence
and is given by the relationship

_ pa/py—1
poly +?

where /, and /, are the densities of the water and sea bed respectively. The value of R will
therefore lie between the approximate limits 0-29 and 0-17. These limits are such that the
multiple reflexions would rapidly decrease in amplitude with increasing order number
and would account for their not being visible on the records in spite of the fact that they
should arrive before the multiple refractions. The zero-order reflexions would be the most
conspicuous, but, as figure 9 shows, could not be resolved from the zero-order refractions.
Further evidence of a low reflexion coefficient was obtained from the reflexion shots in
which the records were characterized by the initial amplitude of the bottom reflexion
being smaller than the amplitude of the sound scattered back from below the bottom.

With other experimental results obtained in the deep sea (Ewing 19502) multiple
reflexions up to at least the third order have been identified, while in the same experiments
