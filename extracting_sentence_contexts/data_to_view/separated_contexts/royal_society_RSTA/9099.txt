The detailed description of H, will follow, our present
object being the derivation of results applicable in general to the whole series of
curves, with H, as a convenient illustration. The values of g decrease as the separation of the components increases. This can
be deduced from the fact that the final slope of all the curves to the axis of « (the
base of the photograph) is smaller than the initial slope. For the final slope is
derived from the final branch,
