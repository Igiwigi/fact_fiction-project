The vessels of the exogenous layers of the root-structures
are much smaller than in the arial stems described. This difference may be merely
characteristic of a distinction between the roots and stems, or it may be due to the
circumstance that the roots belong to a different species from those of which I have
described the stems. The latter view is sustained by the fact that T possess several
examples of undoubted amyeloid* roots having the structure seen in Plate IX. fig. 59. Some similar ones discoyered since this figure was drawn are not only much larger and
more perfect, but are invested by the characteristic bark of these amyeloid roots, re-
moving all doubt as to the generic identity of the entire series of specimens.
