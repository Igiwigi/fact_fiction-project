Oxygen extraction by muscles depends to a large extent one-third of those at sea level (6.7 kPa and 0.47 g m°, respect-
on the density of blood capillaries in those muscles; the ively, as opposed to 21 kPa and 1.22 g m™°). This means that
greater the capillary density, the greater the surface area for not only is there much less oxygen available, but lift generation

passerines that migrate long distances have a greater capillary reduced. Despite the reduction in drag, the minimum mechan-
