They are of very feeble
intensity in strontium chloride and barium chloride, and then only the first pair are
visible, attenuated and shortened. They appear as short lines and rather feeble in photographs taken from electrodes
of Stexexs-MARTIN steel, and from electrodes of iridium. The most remarkable fact
about these lines is, that they are nob visible in the spectra of the alkaline chlorides,
lithium, sodium and potassinum, which were prepared from neutral solutions. Nor are
they to be een in the spectram of aluminium chloride. They do nob appear in photo-
graphs of the spectra of graphite points, either when dry or moistened with water, but
? they are 8een as very faint and short lines when graphite points are moistened with
hydrochloric acid.
