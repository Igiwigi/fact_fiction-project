Fig. 19 represents the alloy containing 74 per cent. of tin, under a magnification
of 200 diameters. The crystallites of free tin are seen in larger quantity and are
surrounded, or nearly surrounded, by regions of the lead constituent.

Fig. 20 shows the alloy containing 85 per cent. of tin. Here the white crystals
of tin oceupy the greater part of the area of the section, the eutectic merely forming
a meshwork between the crystals. In the 95 per cent. alloy shown in the next figure
(No. 21, magnification 200 diameters) the meshwork of eutectic, or, rather, of the
lead constituent of the eutectic, is very thin and no longer continuous. Finally, in
fig. 22, the alloy containing only 1 per cent. of lead (99 per cent. of tin) is shown.
The eutectic can be definitely traced in this micrograph, and the structure of this
alloy is not affected in this respect by prolonged heating at 175°C. This fact,
» together with the cooling-curves already described, leads to the conclusion that the
eutectic extends very nearly to the tin end of the series, and that the solubility of
lead in tin is zero or very nearly zero,

For the purpose of determining the limiting solubility of tin in lead, the alloys in
the neighbourhood of a tin content of 15 per cent. were carefully examined after six
weeks’ exposure to heat at a temperature of 175°C. Examined under moderate
magnifications, by whose aid the presence of “ primary” tin could not fail to be
recognised, the 15 per cent. alloy was found to be entirely homogeneous, the few
white spots seen after four weeks’ heating (as seen in fig. 14) having entirely
disappeared. In the 16 per cent. alloy small specks of primary tin could generally be
observed, the appearance of this alloy after six weeks’ heating being similar to that
