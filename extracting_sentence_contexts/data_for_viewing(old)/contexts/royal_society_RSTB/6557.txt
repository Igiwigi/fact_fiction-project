them gonapophyses homologous to the endopodites of the crustacean limbs and in
this way comparable with the posterior gonapophyses of female insects. SNODGRASS
(1935, p. 590) doubts if the gonapophyses are retained by the pterygote insects. He
discredits the association of gonapophyses with the formation of the aedeagus of
insects for lack of positive ontogenetic evidence. According to him, the aedeagus
is an independent median outgrowth of the body wall; but the formation of the
aedeagus by fusion of the penis lobes, as mentioned above in the flea, has been
observed by various other workers, e.g., Dew1tz (1875), ZANDER (1900, 1901, 1903),
Stncu-Prurut (1924, 6, 1925), and Menta (1933), in other insects. The idea that
the subgenital plates are coxites and that the phallic lobes represent the endopodites
of the gonopods of the ninth abdominal segment (Stvcu-Prurut, 1924, b, p. 71) does
not harmonize with facts observed during the post-embryonic development of some
insects. If these two pairs of genital appendages represent the biramous condition
of the Crustacean limbs, why should two parts of the same limb have independent
origin one after the other? The independent origin of the subgenital plates, as
observed by me in the flea and by Menta in Lepidoptera, occurs also in Coleoptera,
as is clear from SincH-Pruturâ€™s description and drawings (1924, a, p. 861, text-figs.
1, 2). These two structures of different origin cannot possibly belong to the
same appendage. The presence of separate peripodial cavities for the phallic lobes
and their independent origin place them in the same category as the subgenital
plates. In my opinion, the phallic lobes are either some special developments of
doubtful homology found on the ninth abdominal segment, or they are gonopods of
the tenth abdominal segment. The latter view finds support in that during the
embryonic development of some orthopterous insects (WHEELER, 1893, pp. 117,
