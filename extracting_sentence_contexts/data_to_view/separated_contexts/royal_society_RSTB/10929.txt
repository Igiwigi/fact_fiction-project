This suggests
that the Rhynie flora was somewhat depauperate compared
to the others. The most likely explanation is that the Rhynie
flora represents one existing in an inland intermontane
basin where the environment was more stressed than that
in the lowland floodplain deposits represented by the depos-
its from southwest Wales and Gasp√©. The very high taxon
diversity reported from the Ardennes-Rhenish region probably
reflects the fact that these assemblages are from nearshore
marine deposits into which numerous rivers drained bringing
elements of the floras from throughout the entire drainage
basin (i.e. representing the inland intermontane basin and
floodplain deposits). Further evidence that the Rhynie spore
assemblage represents an inland intermontane basin flora is
the presence of taxa unique to Rhynie, such as Dictyotriletes
kerpii, Brochotriletes sp. CW-A and Camptozonotriletes? sp.
