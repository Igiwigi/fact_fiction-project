found buried, in the state of grave bones, over great part of
northern Europe,/as well as North America and Siberia. The
catastrophe producing this gravel, appears. to have been the
last event that has operated generally to modify the surface
of the earth, and the few local and; partial changes that have
succeeded it, such-as the formation of deltas, terraces, tufa,
torrent-gravel and peat-bogs, all conspire to show, that the
period of their commencement was . subsequent to_ that at
which the diluvium was formed.*

* It was $tated in describing the locality of the cave at Kirkdale, and on compar-
ing it with the fact of its containing the remains of large and small aquatic animals,
that there was probably a lake in this part of the country at the period when they
inhabited it ; and this hypothesis is rendered probable by the form and disposition of
the hills that $till encircle the Vale of Pickering. (See Map, Plate XV.)

Inclosed on the south, the west, north-west, and north, by the lofty ranges of the
Wolds, the Howardian hills, the Hambleton hills, and Eastern Moorlands, the waters
of this vale must either run eastward to Filey Bay, or inland towards York ; and such
is the superior elevation of the strata along the coast, that the sources of the Der-
went, rising almost close to the sea, near Scarborough and Filey, are forced to run
west and southward fifty miles inland away from the sea, till falling into the Ouse,
they finally reach .it by turning again eastward through the Humber. | The only
outlet by which. this, drainage is accomplished, is the gorge at New Malton ; and
