The wall is not, however, sufficiently
preserved for detailed description or figures. Even had no further evidence been obtained it would be justifiable to regard the
sporangial nature of the appendages as established by the consistent body of facts
regarding their shape and the presence of the line of dehiscence. A fortunate prepara-
tion, however, enables us to add the conclusive fact of the presence of spores in the
sporangia. The sporangium in question is the lower one on the left in fig. 26. On
examining the carbonaceous material in the film-pulls a distinction had been drawn
between homogeneous opaque portions that were apparently remains of the sporangial
wall and more or less rounded or oval areas with a reticulate structure.
