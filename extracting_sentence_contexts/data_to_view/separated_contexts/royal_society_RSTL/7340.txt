In order to test the theory of flexure of bars (considered as elastic
rods) by actual experiment, a large number of observations as to changes of length cor-
responding to change of supports were made on three iron bars specially prepared for
DX the purpose. Each bar was 40 inches long by an inch square, It will suffice here to
& explain generally the process and give the results for one of the bars. If a bar be sup-
8 ported by its extremities, it is clear that the whole of its upper surface will be compressed,
S while the lower surface will be correspondingly extended ; therefore the length of the
= bar as measured by the distance between two dots at the extremities of the upper surface
3 will be less than if the neutral axis were straight ; in fact, if © be the inclination of the
I bar at either extremity to the horizon, and + the depth of the bar, its curvature will
& cause the dots to approach each other by the quantity i. This effect of curvature will
:= be greatly exaggerated if the dots be engraved, not on the surface of the bar, but on the
Z tops of bits of strong wire inserted (in a vertical position) into the bar at its extremities ; Si if þ be the length of either wire, the approach of the dots to one another by the curva-
S ture of the bar will be *({&+2}).
