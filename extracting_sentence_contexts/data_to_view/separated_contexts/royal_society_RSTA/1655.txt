For the lunar south
pole, Vogler [2] has proposed a habitat of inflated modules protected from radiation by a 100m
diameter dome of concrete, made using inflatable technology and covered with a 3m thick layer
of regolith.

2. Alunar habitat made from local materials

Here, we explore the potential for making a habitat from regolith or rock both to provide
protection from cosmic rays and to withstand atmospheric pressure. In fact, the largest enclosed
structures on Earth until a few hundred years ago were made using locally sourced blocks of stone
in compression. We can learn from them. Figure 1a,b shows the Treasury of Atreus in Mycenae
[7].
