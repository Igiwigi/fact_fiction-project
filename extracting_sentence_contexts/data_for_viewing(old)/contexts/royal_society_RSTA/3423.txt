The logarithmic scale of the x-axis in figure 4c,d draws attention to the first transition from [3
delocalized integrable to chaos. One sees that the range of disorder strengths for which « is large =
and » is small increases as the system size increases. This indicates that in the thermodynamic is
limit, this transition region may disappear and an infinitesimally small h may suffice to take the D3
system into the chaotic regime [61,82]. Figure 4a,b makes more visible the second transition from : =
chaos to spatial localization. Here also, one sees that the chaotic region gets extended, holding for : >
larger values of ht as L increases. This region may disappear in the thermodynamic limit, or it may [a
reduce to a single critical point as in Anderson localization in higher dimensions, or yet it may 8
remain a finite region. What will in fact happen to the two transition regions, integrable-chaos : 3
and chaos-localization, for L > oo as well as the differences and similarities between the two are rad

open questions.

5. Conclusion

We analysed how the presence of level repulsion manifests itself in the dynamics of many-body
quantum systems. We showed that it appears in the form of a correlation hole in the long-time
evolution of the survival probability and as a minor bulge above the saturation values of the
Shannon and entanglement entropies. The correlation hole detects integrable-chaos transitions in
clean and disordered models, and by extension it is also an indicator of the spatial delocalized—
localized transition in interacting systems with random onsite disorder. The correlation hole is
