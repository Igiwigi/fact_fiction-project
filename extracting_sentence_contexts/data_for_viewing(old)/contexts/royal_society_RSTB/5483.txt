interstitial roots, in various stages of forking (Plate 49, fig. 3, Plate 50, figs. 5,7). The
ultimate segments are very fine, almost filiform. Figs. 12, 13, Plate 51, show the mode
of attachment of three aphlebie ; one of the two seen in fig. 12 is coming off from the
rachis almost horizontally, but this is the only instance of this kind so far observed.
Figs. 5, 7 on Plate 2 show a number of free aphlebia-lobes; some of them still lie in
pairs formed by recent forkings, others are about to fork, as indicated by their paired
vascular strands or by more or less obvious constrictions of their outline.

The vascular supply to the appendages arises in the form of closed rings nipped off, as in
“C.” australis and C. antiqua, alternately from the two margins of the petiolar strand
(Plate 50, fig. 9; Plate 51, fig. 15). But it is interesting to observe that the points of
origin of these rings are not strictly the lateral, but the dorso-lateral, margins of the
primary bundle—a fact which betrays the Asterochlena-like behaviour of a petiolar
strand otherwise typically clepsydroid. The outward course of the aphlebia-traces
through the petiolar cortex is always dorso-lateral, as in “‘ C.” australis, Asterochlana
lara, and other zygopterids.

So far as I have seen, the aphlebia-trace never undergoes a dichotomy within the
petiolar cortex, as it was observed to do in “ C.” australis. StmnzeL mentions such
a precocious dichotomy of the strand, leading to a ‘“dineuroid”’ condition, like that
figured in ‘ C.” australis,t and he also figures the condition in one of the petioles§ ;
but a comparison of the type-specimen does not confirm the accuracy of his figure,
in other respects so faithful to the original. The aphlebia in our fig. 13, Plate 3,
