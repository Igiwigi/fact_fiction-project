have been made by different investigators, although they show considerable differences
amongst themselves, nevertheless all point to the same general conclusion; namely,
that it is only for a very limited number of salts that the transport number is
independent of concentration. These differences are probably due in part to the
difficulties of the method, and the very great influence of a small experimental error
in the determination of small changes of concentration, and partly also to the fact
that, following Hrrrorr, many workers have employed membranes of one kind or
another to separate different portions of the solution, and thus prevent mixing by
convection currents, whilst others again have altogether avoided their use. BELN
(‘ Zeit. Phys, Chem., 28, 439, 1898) has shown that the use of certain membranes
affects in a very remarkable manner the value of the transport number, and it is
probable that a considerable number of the discrepancies are to be traced to this
cause, Another serious difficulty consists in the fact that an experiment must only
be carried on for such a time that no change in concentration can take place in the
middle part of the solution, and for many salts the formation of hydrogen and
hydroxyl ions at the electrodes further diminishes this time on account of the great
velocity of these ions, The danger from hydrogen ions has been minimised by the
use of a cadmium anode, and quite recently Noyes (‘ Zeit. Phys. Chem.,’ 36, 63,
1901) has completely overcome this difficulty by the device of adding small quantities
of acid and alkali to the solution in the neighbourhood of the anode and cathode
respectively,

The measurements of Noyes are probably the most accurate that have been made,
and his results again confirm the statement made above.
