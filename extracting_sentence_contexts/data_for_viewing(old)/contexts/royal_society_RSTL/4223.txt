Clay of Wiltshire are not symmetrical ; but the apex of the cone inclines to one
side in consequence of the position of the axis of the guard, and terminates in a
very fine point, as in the example, fig. 4. In this specimen the cells are filled with
calcareous spar, as is frequently the case with that portion of the phragmocone
which is implanted in the alveolus; a fact doubtless connected with the similar
mineral state of the osselet itself. The latter is almost invariably saturated as it
were with crystallized carbonate of lime of a brown colour and radiated structure ;
for notwithstanding the microscopical observations of Dr. CareenTeER and Professor
Owex, I think the evidence is in favour of the conclusion of the Dean or WesTmin-
sTER, that this crystalline condition has resulted from sparry infiltration, subsequently
to interment, into the cellular and radiated calcareons texture of which the osselet.
was originally composed*; in like manner as the crustaceous coverings and spines
of the Echinoderms in the Oolite and Chalk, are 80 saturated with calc-spar as to have
acquired the hardness and peculiar oblique fracture of the erystalline mineral matter.

The facts above described appear to me to confirm the opinion advanced by Mr. C,
Pearce and Mr. CUNNINGToN, that the Belemnoteuthis is generically distinct from the
