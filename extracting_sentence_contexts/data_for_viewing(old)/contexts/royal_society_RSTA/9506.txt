Data for 7,/r, were available for 48 individual months. The value was 1°00 in
4 cases; in 32 cases it was less, and in 12 cases it was greater than unity. Combining
the months of the same name from different years, the means for the 12 months
January to December in order were f

1°01, 0°96, 0°95, 1°02, 1°01, 0°99, 1°00, 1°00, 0°99, 1°02, 0°95, 0°91,

giving as arithmetic mean 0°98,.

The observed departure of r,/r, from unity is in the direction indicated by theory
E and is of the right order, but is in excess of the calculated difference. A close agree-
S ment could hardly be expected on account of the experimental difficulties, and there
4 is the further important fact that the potential gradient observations refer to the
forenoon a little after 10 a.m., while the ionic observations refer to about 8 p.m., and the
6 diurnal variation in the ionic charges has not been ascertained.
a On examining details, however, it will be recognised that some other factor
a probably comes in. While the mean value of p for the whole 12 months is+ 52x 10~°,
© its mean value for the 6 summer months, April to September, is+ 63 x 10~*, and that
= for the 6 winter months only + 40 x 107°.

2 Thus the decline per metre in the potential gradients in summer and winter should
<a be nearly in the ratio of 83:2. The absolute potentials in these seasons, however, as

8 will be seen presently, stand to one another roughly in the ratio of 2:3. Thus the
5 departure of *,/r, from unity should on the average be fully twice as large in summer
