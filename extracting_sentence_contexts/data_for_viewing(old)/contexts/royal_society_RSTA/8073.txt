would thus suggest that the lightning discharges apparently originated near the region
of the cloud corresponding to the peak ©, on the charge record and extended towards
the contiguous region of negative charge. This is what we should expect. For, if
a cloud has an extensive region of positive charge, the lightning discharges must naturally
originate at that end of the region which adjoins the region of negative charge.

From fig. 10 (c) we see that, on October 6, the centre of the thundercloud apparently
came overhead at about 19 hrs. 30 mins. This thunderstorm is one of double type,
and a reference to the electrogram given in fig. 6 at once shows that at this time the
region of the cloud which gave the portion PQ on the electrogram was overhead. It
has already been explained that the extremely quick and violent fluctuations seen in
the portion PQ of the electrogram are due to near lightning discharges. And now the
thunder-lightning interval record confirms the fact that the most active region of the
cloud was nearest to the station at the time.

A comparative study of (a), (b) and (c) of fig. 10 suggests that the most active region
of the thundercloud came nearer the station on October 6 than on September 6 or 7.

This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced more violent
changes in the electrogram of October 6, during the passage overhead of the most
active region of the cloud, than on the other two occasions.
