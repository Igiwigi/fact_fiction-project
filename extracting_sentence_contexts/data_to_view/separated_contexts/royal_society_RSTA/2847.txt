The only test would be that of tracing the effects of the decomposition at
the temperature of the line KL by looking for the appearance of the « phase in the
annealed and slowly-cooled alloys. An endeavour was made to do this, and the
authors think it probable that the a phase can be traced up to a concentration of
aluminium as high as 80 per cent., but it must be admitted that this method is not
very reliable in this instance. The reason lies in the fact that even the homogeneous
alloys of this series never present a perfectly clean polygonal structure—the surfaces
of the crystals always show a certain amount of marking or pattern, while minute

erystals of impurities are often scattered about the specimens. This “ dirty”
appearance of the sections may be due partly to the great difficulty of polishing
them perfectly, but it certainly makes it difficult if not quite impossible to state
definitely at which concentration the appearance of a given phase ceases—it becomes
difficult to decide whether certain markings are due to the causes mentioned above,
or whether they indicate the separation of the « phase along the line KL.
