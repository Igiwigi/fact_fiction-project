If now we extract the cube root of both sides of (80.), and resolve the quadratic
for r, we shall obtain the following equation of the system of branches of the curve
of contact :

From this equation we learn the important fact, that no more than two points of
the curve of contact can exist for each value of 0. To render it subservient to the
completion of our object in this inquiry, it will be necessary to establish two other
properties, viz. that the quantity under the radical is essentially positive, 80 as to
render the curve real for all values of 0, and that of these values one is greater and
the other less than þ sec 0. The slightest attention, however, to the form of the ex-
pression will convince us that this would be a work of great labour if performed in a
perfectly satisfactory manner ; and that probably it would exceed the means at pre-
sent in our possession for conducting such a discussion to a successful termination.
It is fortunately as unnecessary as it is difficult, since by recurring to the genesis of
the curve itself both these conclusions may be readily established ; and as these are
all that are essential to the present investigation, I do not think myself under any
necessity to examine those characters of the curve which are mere matters of mathe-
