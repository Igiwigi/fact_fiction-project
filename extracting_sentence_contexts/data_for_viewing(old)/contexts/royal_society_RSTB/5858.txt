(1929), who has discussed the concept from a general standpoint, defines it as the “ process
of origin of parts of the embryo possessing irreversible prospective value as tested by
self-differentiation,”’ and characterises it as being a process of segregation. The
difficulty here arises that self-differentiation techniques do not in fact test irreversible
prospective value. In Triton the ectoderm can be shown to possess the capacity to
self-differentiation to epidermis, and probably to neural plate, at a stage before it is
restricted to this fate. True irreversible prospective value can only be tested by
interchange experiments. But if segregation is limited to being the process of origin
of parts possessing irreversible prospective value as tested by interchange experiments,
it becomes identical with determination, and it loses the first element mentioned above,
namely, that it is responsible for the origin of parts with new potentialities.

Such new potentialities do in fact arise. Consider a single-stage process of differentia-
tion of a piece of tissue ; for example, the differentiation of neural plate from blastula
ectoderm in Triton. At first the blastula ectoderm is quite indifferent as regards this
process, later it is definitely determined either to become neural plate or not ; only in
the middle period does the differentiation to neural plate exist as an undetermined
potentiality. In this middle period it is competent to form neural plate, and this com-
petence is a new potentiality which has arisen.

The idea of competence covers two concepts already in use, reactionsfihig and labil
determiniert. Reactionsfihig means that the tissue to which the adjective is applied
is competent to differentiate to a certain other tissue but requires a definite stimulus,
while labil determiniert means that it is competent so to differentiate without a definite
stimulus. It is, however, difficult to determine what is a definite stimulus, as can be
