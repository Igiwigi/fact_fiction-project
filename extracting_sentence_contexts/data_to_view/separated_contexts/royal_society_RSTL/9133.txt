I have found ib necessary, for the sake of clearness, to explain the
results of the investigation in the language of a definite theory. It will be easy for
any one to separate the two. The fact that nearly all lines which make their appear-
ance at low temperatures only are lines which widen easily seems to be suggestive. Spectra of the negative pole. â€”It has long been known that in many gases the glow
surrounding the negative electrode has a different colour from the remainder of the
discharge. This colour appears generally more blue to the eye than that of the posi-
tive discharge, and, this fact was the cause that a certain blueness was often ass0ciated
with the idea of negative electricity.
