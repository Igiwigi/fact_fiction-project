The principal object I have in view, is to adduce some addi-
tional proofs, that the bituminous substances are derived from
the organized kingdoms of nature, and especially from vegetable
bodies; for, although many circumstances seem to lead to the
opinion, that the animal kingdom has in some measure contri-
buted to the partial formation of bitumen, yet the proofs are by
no means 80 numerous, nor $0 positive, as those which indicate
the vegetable kingdom to have been the grand source from
which the bitumens have been derived. But this opinion,
(founded upon very strong presumptive evidence,) although
generally adopted, is however questioned by some persons ; and
I shall therefore bring forward a few additional facts, which
will, I flatter myself, contribute to demonstrate, that bitumen
has been, and is actually and immediately formed, from the
resin, and perhaps from some of the other juices of vegetables,

The chemical characters of the pure or unmixed bitumens,
Such as naptha, petroleum, mineral tar, and asphaltum, are, in
certain respects, s0 different from those of the resins and other
inspissated juices of recent vegetables, that, had the former never
occurred but in a separate and unmixed tate, no positive in-
ference could have been drawn from their properties, in proof of
their vegetable origin. Fortunately, however, they have been
'more frequently found under circumstances which have strongly
