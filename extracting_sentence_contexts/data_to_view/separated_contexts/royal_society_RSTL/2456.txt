From the preceding statement we may, I think, conclude,

1Ist, That venous blood contains carbonic acid ; 2nd, That the mere effect of diminished pressure upon the surface of the blood is
not necessarily followed by the escape of its carbonic acid*,

We have seen in some of the aboye experiments that atmospheric air possesses a
property of removing carbonic acid from venous blood; it becomes therefore a
question how this effect is produced. I have ascertained that nitrogen is ineffective;
we may therefore infer that the oxygen is the principal agent ; and that such is the
fact is proved by the following experiments.

10. A piece of moist bladder was tied firmly over the mouth of a tumbler contain-
ing pure oxygen gas. This was introduced into a large bell glass filled with carbonic
acid.
