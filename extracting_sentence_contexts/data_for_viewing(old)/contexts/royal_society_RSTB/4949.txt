in both tests, and by the same amount (47 per cent.). This shows that the discrepancy
is not mainly due to convection currents in the air of the nest, for they would have
accentuated it at the higher temperature. The escape of the moisture must thus
have been mainly by diffusion, and the cause of the higher value of A is probably
the fact that the eggs in the circular nest could not be packed so closely as those
in the rectangular trough of fig. 7. A small increase in the width of the narrow
air passages between the eggs would mean a considerable increase in the diffusion
through them.

B was, of course, calculated with 1-32 cm. as the value of 4. The numbers in
Column A imply a value of about 1-94 cm., and we shall probably be nearest to the
average arrangement of the eggs under a hen if we take 1-6 cm. for the final figure.
The exact value is not of primary importance, for as already explained, the estimation
of the amount of diffusion in the nest is more a question of order of magnitude than of
numerical accuracy.

This completes the data required for solving equation (1), which may now be written :
