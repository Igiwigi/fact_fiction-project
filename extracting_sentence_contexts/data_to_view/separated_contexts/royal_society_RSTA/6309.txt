However, my attempts were met with utter failure; for instance, the
THC was maximum at the southern, rather than near northern boundary, because of the smaller
f near the southern boundary. Furthermore, the THC became stronger instead of weaker with
weaker mixing; the reason was that without additional processes to ensure connectivity along
the side boundaries and the equator (see below), a diffusive boundary layer formed near the

bottom of the eastern boundary. Smaller diffusion meant a narrower boundary layer and stronger : =
downward penetration of low surface density, in turn providing stronger thermal wind shear. : =
I could see no way out of this quandary, and I left the problem aside. 1B
The fact that neither Zhang et al. [20] nor Colin de Verdiére [21] provided a closed-form solution : =
for the THC as a function of the independent parameters, or at least an order-of-magnitude ZR
estimate from scaling assumptions that was based on the conceptual picture, meant that we were [3
still without a theoretical estimate of THC strength that showed at least rudimentary dynamical : =
consistency. Hence, the only extant theoretical estimate of THC strength was one that had taken :8
its starting point in the thermocline scaling of Welander [22] and was later applied to the THC :3

by Bryan [23]. But this scaling had serious inconsistencies, as already noted by Bryan [23] and
repeated now.
