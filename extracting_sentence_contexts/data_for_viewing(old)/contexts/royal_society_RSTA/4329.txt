that the magnitude of the differences (T — Tog) have a smaller (less negative) magnitude than
previously determined by AGT [13,17], in slightly better agreement with the CVGT data of Kemp
et al. [53] than with those of Astrov et al. [54].

Most importantly, the outstanding progress achieved by the AGT method during the last few
years is well illustrated by the visual comparison of the uncertainty of the WG4 interpolation
(shaded area in figure 4) with the much smaller uncertainty associated with the dense NPL
dataset. By separating the contributions to the overall uncertainty of (T — Tog) of [47], it is evident
that the uncertainty associated with the acoustic determination of T is significantly smaller
than the total uncertainty which can be achieved in the realization of ITS-90 using standard
platinum resistance thermometers [55]. In fact, the unprecedented precision and accuracy of NPL
thermometry reveals some subtle features of the differences (T — Tog), previously unnoticed, and
whose origin is likely to be inherent in the reference function of the ITS-90. Moreover, analysis
of NPL data close to Trpw sheds new light on the previously discussed [56] discontinuity of the


slope d(T — To9)/dTo9. Estimating the slope d(T — T99)/dT99 above Typw from (T — Tog) at the Lo |
gallium point gives a good estimate of the slope just above Ttpw. However, estimating the slope

d(T — To9)/dT99 below Typw from (T — To) at the mercury point gives a misleading estimate of =a
the slope just below Typw. The discontinuity (defined as the slope above Typw minus the slope 1B
below Typw) appears to be slightly negative or possibly zero (—0.02 + 0.02 mK K~!) rather than :<
the previously reported [4] positive values (+0.03 mK K~}). :
