All else equal, the risk of genuine surprise is higher to the extent that an agent has limited
knowledge of a system—of its past behaviour and the processes that underlie that behaviour. The
less the agent knows about a system, and especially the less he knows about the part or aspect of
the system that particularly interests him, the more likely it is that he is completely unaware of
some of the factors and interactions that will influence what happens.

iii) Overconfidence

All else equal, the risk of genuine surprise is higher to the extent that an agent is overconfident
about the extent of his knowledge of the system. That is, the risk of surprise is higher to the
extent that what the agent thinks he knows about how the system works exceeds what he actually
knows. In the extreme, he may think that there are almost certainly no unknown unknowns that
are relevant to the question that interests him, when in fact there are many.

10What we have in mind seems similar to what Schneider et al. [13] call ‘imaginable conditions for surprise’.

‘While there are different views of what makes a system complex, we assume that being complicated (i.e. involving many
interacting parts and processes) and nonlinear is sufficient for being complex.


(iv) Past instances of genuine surprise

All else equal, if there have been past instances of genuine surprise when investigating the system,
this is a risk factor for genuine surprise going forward. This is direct evidence that the system is
capable of presenting the agent with genuine surprises.
