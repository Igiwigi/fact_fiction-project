inhomogeneity and that makes space-time inhomogeneous universally for all particles. It should
therefore represent a universal physical attribute which is universally shared by all that physically
exist. That is clearly the energy-momentum.

With T,, identified with the energy-momentum distribution, then the above equation becomes
Einstein’s gravitational equation in GR with « as the gravitational constant. It has naturally arisen
from inhomogeneity of space-time without our asking for it. Of course inhomogeneity is caused
by the presence of the universal force. Electric field makes space-time inhomogeneous only for
charged particles but universal force does it for all. Since Einstein gravity arises from space-time
inhomogeneity without reference to a particular charge, it has therefore to be universal linking
to all particles—massive as well as massless. Thus, the dynamics of the universal force is entirely
driven by space-time geometry. In particular, there is no freedom to prescribe the inverse square
law; it is in fact dictated by the geometry of space-time. It is remarkable to note that Newton’s
Law follows from the space-time geometry. This is the fact which is not generally appreciated and


acknowledged upfront like this. This is evident from the fact that no textbook makes this explicit
statement.

Also note that A naturally arises as a constant of integration without any acrobatics of trace free
or unimodular gravity [6,7]. When T,, = 0 everywhere, it reduces to the homogeneous space-time
of constant curvature indicating absence of gravity. The viewpoint that emerges is as follows:

Space-time is homogeneous and has constant curvature when free of all forces including
gravity, and it becomes inhomogeneous when matter/gravity is present. This is exactly what
