In this it was noted
that there were s8ome indications of basilar meningitis, but there was no softening or
destructive lesion of any part of the brain except that of the hippocampal and lower
temporo-sphenoidal region described and figured. These experiments were made without antiseptic precautions, and therefore the
exact limitation of the primary lesions could not be ensured, owing to secondary
inflammation which invariably set in. And this is a fact which must always be
reckoned with in estimating the effects of cerebral lesions made without antiseptics. It is altogether impossible to reach and destroy the hippocampal region withoub
causing injury to some other parts of the brain, and ib is necessary to eliminate the
effects attributable to these by previous experiments. In the experiments about to be related the hippocampal region was injured or
destroyed as in former experiments by heated wires or other cauteries, pusbed through
the occipital lobe downwards and forwards along the hippocampal region, or guided
along this region by a director inserted between the under 8nrface of the occipital
lobe and the tentorium cerebelli ; or by means of incisions from the convex aspect of
the temporo-sphenoidal lobe 80 calculated as to direction and depth as to sever the
