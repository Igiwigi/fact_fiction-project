continues to move forward with unimpaired velocity.
Hence the time elapsing between the two positions shown

in the figure is ae The momentum which has been destroyed up to this time is to

a first approximation that of the portion of
the bullet which has been flattened out,
namely that portion shown shaded in the
dotted figure. Knowing the distribution
of mass along the length this is easily
calculated. This simple theory is subject
to some qualifications due partly to want
of perfect fluidity, and partly to the fact
that the sections of the bullet are not
brought right up to the face and there
stopped dead, as is assumed in the theory,
but are more or less gradually retarded or
deflected in the region of curved steam-lines
at C. These corrections are, however, most
conveniently introduced when comparing
the theory with the experimental results.
The bullets used were of two patterns,
one the ordinary service form (Mark VI.)
and the other a soft-nosed bullet supplied
