From this it will be seen that both in the case of mechanical and of chemical
stimulation the same tendeney to the production of rhythmic response on the part
of the paralyzed tisxues of Aurelia may be observed, as in the case of electrical
stimulation. The principal differences consist in the rhythm being much less sustained
in the former than in the latter case. But by experimenting on other species of
Medusz I have been able to obtain artificial rhythm in response to mechanical and
chemical stimulation of a much more sustained character than that which, under s8nch
modes of stimulation, occurs in Aurelia, T have no explanation to offer why ib is that
some 8pecies or 8ome tissnes present 80 much more readiness to manifest s8nstained
rhythm under certain modes of stimulation, and less readiness to manifest it under
other modes, than do other species or tisxues. Probably these differences depend on
some peculiarities in the irritability of the tissnes which it is hopeless to ascertain ;
but, in any case, the fact remains that while Aurelia, Cyanea, and the covered-
eyed Medusm generally, are the best species for obtaining artificial rhythm under
the influence of faradaic stimulation, some of the naked-eyed Medusz are the best
species for obtaining ib under the influence of the constant current, and also under
that of mechanical and chemical stimulation, I have already spoken of this effect
of the constant current in the case of SarsiÂ«; I shall now proceed to describe the
effects of mechanical and chemical stimulation on the same species.

I is but rarely that artificial rhythm can be produced in the paralyzed nectocalyx
of Sarsia by means of mechanical stinmlation, but in the case of the polypite, a very
decided, peculiar, and persistent rhythm admits of being produced by this means.
