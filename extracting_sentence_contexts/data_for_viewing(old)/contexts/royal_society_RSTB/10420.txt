single action at each point in time, realized through the
position and confirmation of a singular body. As
argued above, these actions are based on massively par-
allel simulations of possible states of the (social) world
and self, supporting real-time inference in an intention-
laden world and body. This creates a fundamentally
new credit assignment problem: which value and/or
future action should be assigned to which property of
the real or imagined world given the outcome of a
single act? If the causes of the actions of other agents
are hidden, so are their outcomes and valuation, i.e. a
social world by necessity operates on norms that are
hidden. Indeed, this fact has led to the hypothesis that
the human mind is specialized in norm extraction
[146]. Hence, in order to optimize real world action
the agent is forced to appraise performance with res-
pect to a singular interpretation of the mixed reality
probabilistic states that have given rise to its actions.
Consciousness serves intentional valuation and norm
extraction. Consciousness solves credit assignment for
the parallel real-time control systems that drive a
single social agent by inferring norms and transferring
them as value. In DAC terms, we can rephrase this as
the challenge of finding alignment between the parallel
and probabilistic controllers that dominate real-time
