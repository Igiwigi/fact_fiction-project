ideas involving the production of global cooling aerosols to compensate for the warming
associated with continuing fossil fuel burning, was first postulated by Latham [1,2]. The basic
principle behind the idea is to seed marine stratocumulus clouds with seawater aerosol generated
at or near the ocean surface. Most particles would have sufficiently large salt mass to ensure
their activation and subsequent growth within the clouds, without being so large as to encourage
precipitation. Moreover, they would be sufficiently numerous so as to enhance the cloud droplet
number concentration to values substantially higher than the natural level, thereby enhancing the
cloud albedo [3,4].

Major advantages of using MCB as compared to other geoengineering proposals, such as
injecting sulfur into the stratosphere (which can deplete stratospheric ozone), include the ability
to localize application, the relatively rapid reduction of most effects on cessation of spraying,
and the fact that seawater is non-polluting and non-toxic. As with all proposed geoengineering
methods, the possibility of unintended consequences cannot be excluded.

We have been studying various techniques for salt spray production for some time and our
earlier results have been reported [5-7]. Briefly reviewing, the most obvious way to obtain
monodisperse droplets is to spray through sub-micrometre orifices in the Rayleigh mode [8].
Our efforts at keeping 0.5m orifices open over extended periods were unsuccessful [6], even
using continuous filtering of the liquid. The amount of seawater that would need to be sprayed
to produce 10!7 nuclei s~! through 0.4 1m holes, as proposed by Salter et al. [8], would be of the
order of 301s~!. Spraying this amount of liquid from a concentrated source is bound to give rise to
substantial evaporative cooling of the surrounding air, which could, because of the stratification
thus created, impede the rise of the nuclei into the clouds.
