Thus it appears that the bones which are in most perfect
preseryation, and belong to existing species, have been intro-
duced during the post-diluvian period ; whilst the extinct
bears and hyzna are referable to, the antediluvian state of the
earth, In corroboration of this, I found in 1820, in the col-
lection of the Monastery of Kremsminster, near Steyer, in
Upper Austria, skulls and bones of the Ursus spelzus in con-
solidated beds of diluvial gravel, forming a pudding-stone,
and dug for building near the monastery ; from which it ap-
pears that this species of bear lived in the period immediately
preceding the formation of that diluvium ; and the same thing
has been already shown of the extinct hyzna in the gravel
of France and Germany. M. RosENMULLER states that in all the caverns he has
examined, the bones are disposed nearly after the same man-
ner; sometimes scattered Separately, and sometimes accumu-
lated in beds and heaps of many feet in thickness ; they are
found every where from the entrance to the deepest and most
Secret recesses ; never in entire skeletons, but single bones
mixed confusedly from all parts of the body, and animals
of all ages. The skulls are generally in the lowest part of

the beds of bone, having from their form and weight sunk

or rolled' downwards, as the longer and lighter bones were
moved and disturbed continually by the living animals pass-
ing over them; the lower jaws are rarely found in con=
tact with, or near to the upper ones, as would follow from
the fact last mentioned. * They are often buried in a brown
argillaceous or marly earth, as'in the cases of Gailenreuth,
Zahnloch, and in the Hartz, which earth, from an analysis
by M. FRISCHMAN, Seems to contain a large 'proportion of
animal matter derived from the decay of the fleshy parts of
the bears.
