PROFESSOR K. PEARSON ON THE INFLUENCE OF NATURAL

(1.) Introductory. On the Influence of Selection upon Correlation.

‘Ar an earlier stage in the development of the semecea theory of evolution ¥
was suggested that the coefficient of correlation (Garon 8 function) might be fount
constant for all races of the same species—in fact, 1t was considered p »ssible that this
coeflicient might be the long-sought-for criterion of identity in species. Professor
Wepoy, following up this suggestion of Mr. Gauron’s, then made the elaborate
series of measurements on crabs with which his name will always be closely associated. To a first approximation these researches seemed to confirm the possibility of
Gaxton’s function being a true criterion of species.
