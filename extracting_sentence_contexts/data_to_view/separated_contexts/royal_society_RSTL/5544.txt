Its form and relations may be gathered
from figs 8, 9 and 10. In 8 and 10 the bodies of the cells are viewed on the flat, and
the nucleus appears as an oval colourless body, about zz/ggth of an inch long by goth
of an inch broad. In fig. 9 the body of the cell is seen edgewise applied to the wall of
a capillary blood-vessel, which is embraced by its processes. 'The thickness of the
nucleus is thus displayed, and is shown to be equal to that of the cell in which it lies,
which in fact it causes to bulge slightly, and also nearly as great as the breadth of the
nucleus in figs. 8 and 10. In the cell of fig. 10, the thickness of the nuclens, measured
in the manner aboye described, was found about equal to its breadth. The nucleus
fig. 8 is not centrally placed in the body of the cell, and I have in some other cases
8een it $till more excentric®, :

The contents of these cells are very minute dark granules or molecules suspended in
a colourless fluid, in which I have often seen them moving freely: when in considerable
mass they produce a jet-black appearance, but exhibit a brown tint when present only
in small quantity.
