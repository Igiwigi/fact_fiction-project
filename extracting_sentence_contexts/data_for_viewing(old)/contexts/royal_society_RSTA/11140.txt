surface tension will depend upon the nature of the transition through the surface
layer. The mode of transition may depend only on the chemical nature of the
solution and the potential difference across the space in which the transition takes
place. On this view the electrostatic effect and the mode of transition for a given
solution will be determined by the potential difference, and therefore the surface
tension will be fixed by the potential difference. It remains to determine how the
relation between the surface tension and the potential difference depends upon the
chemical nature and concentration of the solution.

It is scarcely necessary now to set forth the arguments against the second hypo-
thesis of the Helmholtz theory of the electrometer; but I shall endeavour to show
by consideration of observations of the type held to throw greatest doubt upon the
theory, that the first hypothesis gives results in close accord with the facts, and need
not therefore be abandoned, even if the second should be proved untenable.

RELATION BETWEEN THE LieepMANN-HeLMHOLTZ THEORY AND OTHER THEORIES OF
ELEcTROCAPILLARY PHENOMENA. :

It may be well to point out the relation such results bear to the theory of
Warsura, which is, perhaps, the most strongly advocated in opposition to the
Helmholtz theory. Strictly speaking, the Warburg theory deals only with the
ascending branch of the curve. It ascribes the increase in surface tension to the
diminution in the concentration of a mercury salt in the neighbourhood of the
capillary meniscus. According to Warpure the effect of an E.M.F. established
between the terminals of the electrometer is to convert the latter into a kind of
