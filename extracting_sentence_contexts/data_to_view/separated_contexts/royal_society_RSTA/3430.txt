Figure 4. Evidence for shock powering of LBV giant eruptions, from Smith et al. [44]. (a) A comparison of the early (day 34)
and late-time (day 1836) spectra for UGC 2773-0, highlighting the excess blue emission. Both spectra are normalized to the red
continuum level, and in fact the red spectra appear very similar except for Ha and Ca‘ . In the blue, there is a clear excess of line
emission at late times. (b) Isolates this excess blue emission by subtracting the normalized day 34 spectrum from the normalized
day 1836 spectrum. The grey plot is the residual, and the black plot is a smoothed version of the residual emission.
