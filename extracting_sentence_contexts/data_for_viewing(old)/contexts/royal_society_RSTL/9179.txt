holding good in this case opens up an interesting subject for our contemplation. It

will be observed that, so far as the moyements in question are themselves concerned,
they are undistinguishable from an ordinary reflex act—such, for instance, as we have
observed to occur in Sarsia. But we are accustomed to hear that for the occurrence of
a truly reflex act, the presence of ganglionic or central nerye-matter is requisite. Yet
in the case before us we have exceedingly precise action of an apparently reflex kind,
which is nevertheless quite independent of the only ganglia that can be shown to occur
in the organism. In view of this fact, therefore, I was led to think it probable that
the reflex centres I was in search of might be seated in the polypite, Accordingly I
cut off the polypite, and tried stimulating its own substance directly. I found, however,
that no matter how small a portion of this organ I used, and no matter from what part,
of the organ I cut it, this portion would do its best to bend over to the side which I
irritated, Similarly, no matter how short a stump of the polypite I left in connexion
with the nectocalyx, on irritating any part of the latter, the stump of the polypite
would deflect itself towards that part of the bell, although of course, from its short
length, it was unable to reach it. Hence there can be no doubt that every portion of
the polypite—down, at least, to the size which is compatible with conducting these
experiments—is independently endowed with the capacity of very precisely localizing a
point of irritation which is seated either in its own swbstance or in that of the bell *.
