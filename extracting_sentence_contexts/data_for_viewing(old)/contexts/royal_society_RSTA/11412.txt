(a.) The age of both husband and wife at the time of marriage. The real fertility
Smay be screened by late marriages of one or both parents. The relation of fertility
eto age at marriage has been dealt with by several writers, notably by Duncan and
SpA NSELL. fg
(b.) The duration of marriage. The data may be taken from a marriage not yet
complete, both parents being still alive. Or from a marriage which is complete one
er both parents being dead. In the former or the latter case the marriage may be
‘geomplete so far as fertility is concerned, 7.¢., details of offspring may be available till
Zthe wife has reached the age of 50 years, which for statistical purposes may be taken
Eas an upper limit to fecundity.
S (c.) Restriction of fertility during marriage. It has been shown in a paper on
EReproductive Selectiont that there is evidence of the sensible influence of this factor
gin man. It tends to give fictitious values to the fertility of the younger, rather than
Ethe elder generation, and so obscures the correlation.
& We have accordingly two problems before us :
§ (i.) Supposing these and other factors tending to screen the effects of reproductive
selection to exist, can we show that it still produces sensible effects in the case of
Sman, and thus demonstrate that fertility is really inherited ?
(ii.) Can we by eliminating these factors so far as possible obtain a lower limit to

the coefficient of heredity in the case of fertility, and ascertain whether it
approximates in value to what we might expect from the Law of Ancestral
Heredity ?

The first impression of the reader may be that it is only needful to select the
