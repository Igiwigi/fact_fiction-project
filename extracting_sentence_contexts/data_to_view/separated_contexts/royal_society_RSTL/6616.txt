E If, however, the plant cannot assimilate free Nitrogen under the conditions of the

Spply of combined Nitrogen just referred to, unless it has attained a certain vigour of

growth, or reached a certain stage of its development, and the supply of combined

itrogen has been insufficient, to bring it to the snpposed requisite point, then no
imilation of Nitrogen would take place, even though it might do 80 provided the
per stage of growth had been passed. To the cases here supposed we shall recur
ther on.

= If the assimilation of free Nitrogen can take place at all periods of the growth of the

Flant, and in the absence of all sources of combined Nitrogen, the solution of our ques-

Fon becomes much more simple than in either of the cases above referred to. In illustration of the fact that, within a certain range of other conditions, there can
be no difficulty in securing in an experiment those involved in the presence of an excess,
of a certain limited quantity, or of no combined Nitrogen, attention may be directed
to the phenomena of vegetable growth when seeds are grown in a $o0il and atmosphere
free from combined Nitrogen. Under the circumstances snpposed, all the conditions with regard simply to the rela-
tive quantity of combined Nitrogen are afforded. Thus, when the seed is first 8own, it
contains within itself an excess of combined Nitrogen, s0 far as the demands of the

Plant at the time are concerned, 'The rapidity with which the Nitrogen of the sced can
