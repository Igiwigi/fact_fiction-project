mentary) remains stable in carers’ input, and changes only in
children, presumably reflecting changes in cognitive skills.
These studies mainly emphasize the role of gesture production
by children in eliciting labelling from their parents [92] and in
predicting language development in the children [77,93,95].
Crucially, these findings suggest that children’s communicative
milestones in integrating speech and gesture are not the direct
result of the nature of gestural input received [94], and generally
indicate a preponderance of deictic (pointing or showing)
gestures compared to only a small proportion of iconic (or
representational) gestures [94,97].

This latter fact, however, may be the result of scoring
decisions by the researchers. Iconicity may be embedded in cer-
tain kinds of deictic gestures, but may go unreported. For
example, the category of deictic gestures used by Puccini et al.
[98] includes Action Demonstration (with an object), Object
Demonstration (with an object) and Show. These types of deictic
gestures seem very amenable to the embedding of iconic
elements. For example, a parent could have been observed per-
forming an action or object demonstration consisting in holding
a toy frog and moving the frog in an iconic, jumping manner
through the air while providing the label ‘jump’ or ‘frog’. How-
ever, this would have been coded as deictic, not as iconic. Thus,
in focusing on a (broad) category of deictics, and possibly sub-
