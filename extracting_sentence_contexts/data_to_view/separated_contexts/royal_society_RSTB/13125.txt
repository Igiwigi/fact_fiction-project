Further discussion of the relationship tree-like structure in the data?

quantify the strength of the tree-like structure in the data offer
another line of validation and do not assume tree-like evol-
ution a priori. In fact, all traits being considered for
phylogenetic reconstruction should first be formally examined
for phylogenetic signal against the proposed tree model (see
e.g. [15]). When a lack of tree-like signal is detected, and/or
considerations of transmission mode or benchmarking imply
that a trait is unsuitable for methods involving phylogenetic
reconstruction (i.e. figure 1c), phylogenetic methods that do
not require tree-like data—but instead model the contempora-
neous distribution of cross-cultural variation while controlling
for detectable phylogenetic signal—can offer informative
alternatives (i.e. figure 1b). These latter methods might even
be preferred, when a number of different traits and variables
are being modelled, as phylogenetic reconstructions limit
researchers to investigations of a maximum of two binary
traits in coevolutionary models.
