Indeed, in all cases when the
air-layer is very thin, the share of pressure can be neglected. Moreover, as
will be evident from the formula, the sign of the pressure portion varies according
as b, is less or greater than b.. With regard to the sign of the more important
temperature portion, the fact that it follows the rule just indicated will be evident
from the following considerations. Rise of temperature causes a diminution in the
refractive index of the air, and a corresponding increase in the wave-length. The
same amount of separation of the surfaces will, therefore, contain fewer wave-lengths,
and if no expansion of the tripod and object (if one is being used) occurred, the


:

observer would perceive the transit of the bands to the extent indicated by the
correction, and in the same direction as the bands move when the two surfaces
approach each other ; so that the effect of rise of temperature on the refraction of
the air is similar to that produced by approach of the two surfaces.
