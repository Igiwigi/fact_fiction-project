The deep-lying detritus termed the “ sakia gravels’ is the most important water-
channel ; encountered at a depth of some 10 metres, it yields water to the indigenous
cattle-power water-lifting wheels known as “ sakias.” The rate of propagation of
the flood wave through it down the Delta has been observed by AUDEBEAU and by
Frerrar. Its importance consists in the fact that it offers practically no obstacle to
transmission of pressure changes, and relatively little to bulk movement of water. This importance is often overlooked through the inevitable use of distorted vertical
scales (cf. figs. 6, p. 346, and 43, p. 378).
