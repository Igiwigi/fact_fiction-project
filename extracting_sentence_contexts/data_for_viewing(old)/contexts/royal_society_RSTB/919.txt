Since Tadpoles are not available in summer or autumn, we have not as yet

however, are to be found in all seasons, and in these animals we have so far coal
only one kind of wandering cell which is without specific granulation, and has a
spherical nucleus and scanty cell substance. In the very late foetus the wandering
cells still show no granulation but there are now two kinds of cells present, one with
a round nucleus and one with a lobed nucleus. In the adult all these three types are
undoubtedly present. Thus we find a certain phylogenetic and ontogenetic support
for the statement that the very divergent elements of the sporadic mesoblast have a
morphological homogeneity in the fact that they have arisen from a primitive amoeboid
wandering cell with no specifie granulation, by a process of morphological and
physiological differentiation akin to that which has, pari passu, led to the increasing
complexity of the animal generally. &

not the most primitive of their functions. They are also related to the general
