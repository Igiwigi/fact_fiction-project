In the above paragraphs a number of characters have been brought forward, showing
an almost uniform progress of complexity and differentiation of the vegetative organs,

consisting of about nine layers of cells, Todea superba has wings with only one or two layers, it thus

from the Leptosporangiate Ferns, through the Osmundacee and Marattiacee to the
Cycadacee, and there is no apparent objection on other grounds to thinking that these
plants constitute a natural series ; in other words, that they indicate, at least roughly,
a line of natural descent. Tf this be 80 we are confronted by a remarkable fact. It
has been repeatedly insisted upon that the characters of the vegetative organs of
Angiopteris approach very closely to those of certain Cycadacewe. Yet between the two
there is all the difference in the reproductive organs between the characteristic free
prothallus and antherozoid of the Vascular Cryptogams, and the endosperm and pollen-
tube of the Gymnosperms. This is one of the most striking examples in the vegetable
kingdom of the non-parallelisgm in progress of the vegetative and of the reproductive
A organs : here while there is comparatively little progress in the vegetative organs
8 from the Marattiacee to the Cycadacee, the sexual reproduction shows that great

Z different point in the vegetable kingdom, viz. : a persistence of the reproductive
