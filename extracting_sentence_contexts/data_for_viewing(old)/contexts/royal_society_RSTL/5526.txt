21. Thavenot succeeded in obtaining any good geometrical definition of the Quippian,

and the following is only giyen for want of something better.
The curve

T.PU{P6H(#U+6B8HU)} —P6GHU{T(«U+68HU).P(«U+6P8HU)}=0,
which is derived in what may be taken to be a known manner from the cubic, is
general a curve of the sixth class. But if the syzygetic cubic «U+68HU=0 be pro-
perly selected, viz. if this curve be such that its Hessian breaks up into three lines, then
both the Pippian of the cubic zU+6BHU=0, and the Pippian of its Hessian will break
up into the same three points, which will be a portion of the curve of the sixth .class,
and discarding these three points the curve will nk down to one on the third class, and
will in fact be the Quippian of the cubic.

To show this we may take
«U+6ÞHU=a"+/*+=0
as the equation of the syzygetic cubic satisfying the prescribed condition, for this value

in fact gives
H(zU+68HU)=—ayz=0,

a system of three lines. We find, moreover,
P(#U+68HU)=P(a*+3*+2)=—Ent
