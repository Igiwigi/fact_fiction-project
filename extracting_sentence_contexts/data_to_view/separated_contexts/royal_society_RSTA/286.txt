The most
conserved regions are two short stretches situated —35 and —10 nucleotides from the site at
which transcription begins [2, ch. 7]. These regions are thought to provide the binding site that is
specifically recognized by the RNA polymerase protein (figure 2a). There are in fact numerous proteins that, like the polymerase, are able to recognize and bind
specific nucleotide sequences. Their binding sites are typically between six and 20 base pairs in
length. Binding is mediated by physical interactions between residues on the protein and on the
DNA molecule.
