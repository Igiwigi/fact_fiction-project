between the cloud feedbacks in the standard experiments as in figure 1a versus rescaled ConvOff
feedbacks calculated in the manner described above, to give an estimate of the spread in the
ConvOff feedback making an allowance for the effect of changes in the present-day net CRE.
This results in a range of 0.91 (—0.30 to 0.61) Wm~?K~! for the scaled ConvOff feedbacks, a
reduction of 31% compared with their original range of 1.32 (—0.52 to 0.80) Wm~? K~!. Similarly,
the standard deviation is reduced by 38%. This constitutes a modest reduction of 15% compared
with the range of the standard models (1.07), but not a substantial one. Similarly, the standard
deviation reduces by 22%. This suggests that even if the ConvOff experiments were re-tuned
to bring their control simulations into closer agreement with the standard model versions, the
overall range in their cloud feedbacks would not be greatly reduced, supporting our initial
conclusions above.

We should of course bear in mind the fact that this estimate of the impact of retuning is very
simplistic and could be inaccurate. However, there are reasons to be optimistic. First, most of the
ConvOff feedback estimates are closer to the standard ones after they are rescaled. The points
in figure 1b are mostly closer to the diagonal line than those in figure 1a, and the correlation
coefficient between standard and ConvOff cloud feedbacks increases from 0.55 to 0.65 with the
rescaling, becoming significantly different from zero at the 5% confidence level. This is what we
would expect to see if (i) the scaling method was correctly adjusting for the effects of increased low
level cloudiness on the cloud feedbacks in the ConvOff experiments and (ii) such impacts were
contributing substantially to the differences between the cloud feedbacks in the standard and
ConvOff experiments. Additionally, we find that if all of the feedbacks (standard and ConvOff)
are rescaled to values consistent with the observed net CRE value of —17.1 Wm“? from the CERES
EBAF (Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy Systems Energy Balanced and Filled) dataset [78],
then the correlation increases even further to 0.81 (figure 1c). This suggests that the rescaling is
