Following out this idea, he can bring
practically any observations on the structure of the larvee into line with his theory ;
for instance, in the amphiblastula he simply assumes that one half has advanced
further in this cycle than the other. He first describes (his fig. 28) a larva of
Grantia compressa entirely composed of flagellated cells (a parenchymula, in fact) ;
this he explains as a very early stage. In reality, it presumably belongs to some
