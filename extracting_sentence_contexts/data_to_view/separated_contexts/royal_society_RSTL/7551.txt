10. If, however, the given conditions are not completely independent (that is, if the
corresponding relations are not completely independent), then the &-fold locus, the {-told
locus, &c. intersect in a common («—z)fold locus, and besides in a residual point-system. The several points of the (—/j)fold locus give special solutions—in fact the yery notion
of the conditions being properly satisfied by a curye implies that, the curve shall satisfy
a true (4+I+&.)fold, that is, a true -fold condition ; the proper solutions are there-
fore comprised among the solutions given by the residual point-system, and the number
of them is as before equal to the order of the point-system, or number of the points
thereof, Zess the number of points which give special solutions: the order of the point-
system is, as has been seen, equal to the product of the orders of the k-fold locus, the

t-fold locus, &c., tess a reduction depending on the nature of the common (4—g)fold
locus, and the difficulty is in general in the determination of the value of this reduction. 11. 1n all that precedes, the number of the parameters has been taken to be @; but if

the parameters are taken to be contained in the equation of the curve homogeneously, then
the parameters before made use of are in fact She ratios of these homogeneous para-
meters; and using the term henceforward as referring to the homogeneous Parameters,
the numbers of the parameters will be =o+1.
