This suggests an instrumental drift at the
average rate of —39y per annum, ~

The chief importance perhaps of these calculations is the light they throw on the
trustworthiness of the magnetic curves and measurements. It is unnecessary to
emphasise the fact that when instrumental creep is large it is a source of very

considerable uncertainty. The results obtained above are not put forward as exact

measures of the instrumental creep, but only as showing its order of magnitude and

the general fact that it was small. Most of the quiet day curves were measured
