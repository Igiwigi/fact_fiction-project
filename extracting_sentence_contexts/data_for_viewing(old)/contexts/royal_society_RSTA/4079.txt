of ASm = —8J kg! K1 [99]. A major drawback of these compounds is mechanical instability. The
instability is considered to be from the volume change of +0.2% [97] when crossing the transition
temperature, leading to embrittlement of the bulk samples.

Recently, the above-mentioned issues were tackled by applying internal pressure to the
compound by adding boron to the system [100]. For the compound MnFeg 95P,595Bo.075Sig 33, a
cyclic adiabatic temperature change of ATag = 2.55 K with a cyclic ASm © 10} kg~! K~! ina field
change of 1T with a thermal hysteresis of 1.6K was observed. This enhancement of properties
is ascribed to the larger field dependence of Tc and lower latent heat of this material compared
with Mn-Fe-P-Si. Furthermore, the mechanical integrity of this compound was reported to be
optimized to a point where no breaking or cracking of the samples could be observed, even after
10000 cycles of magnetization and demagnetization [101]. This improvement in the structural
integrity was ascribed to the fact that there is no discontinuous volume change present when
passing through the transition but a comparable change in the a/c lattice parameters of the base
Mn-Fe-P-Si compound is preserved.

It was also shown that the B-containing compounds Mn,Feq 95~x)P(1—y—z)SizBy are highly
tuneable while preserving the giant MCE with a limited thermal hysteresis in a broad temperature
range [58]. Very recent works show that boron can also be substituted by nitrogen, possibly
increasing the industrial applicability of this compound [102].

In summary, the compounds of Mn—Fe-P-Si-B/N are, as for the La(Fe,Mn,Si)|3H,-type alloys,
a highly promising class of materials for magnetic refrigeration due to their precisely tuneable
transition temperatures with low hysteresis and high reversible values of ASm and ATq at low
