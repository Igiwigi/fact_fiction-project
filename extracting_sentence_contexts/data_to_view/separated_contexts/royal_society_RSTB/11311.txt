general thermodynamic concepts can be applied to other ID, the fact that all these DBD snapshots are ‘structured’, the

extensive loop regions occupy different conformations, corre-
sponding helices are of variable lengths and the N-terminal
beta hairpin clearly shows different degrees of foldedness
