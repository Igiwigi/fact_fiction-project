and properties of lac. Mr. WiLk1xs informed me, that the Hindus dissolve shell lac

by damp or water. Upon trial, I found the fact to be exactly as
Mr. WiLKins had stated, and therefore made other experiments;
but the results of these I shall at present omit, as they will
occur with more propriety and perspicuity in the latter part of
this Paper. In respect to the natural history of lac, we are much in-
debted to Mr, KzrR,* Mr. SaunDERs,F and Dr. RoxBuRGH; |
from whose valuable communications to this Society, we learn
many curious particulars concerning the formation of this sub-
Stance, which, from their accounts, and from inspection, evi-
dently appears to be the nidus or comb of the insect called
