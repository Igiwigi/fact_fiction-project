pointed out as desirable.


126 MR. GLAISHER ON THE RADIATION OF HEAT,

Each set of observations may be looked upon as a series of experiments made
for the purpose of ascertaining the different tendencies of yarious bodies to become
cold upon exposure to a cloudless sky at night. To many persons it must be a new
fact, that a perfectly dry body, placed in contact on all sides with other bodies of
the same temperature with itself when the sky is covered by clouds, shall on the sky
becoming less cloudy or cloudless, become much colder than those bodies, to 80 great
an amount as is exhibited in the following tables, and that it shall remain 80 for many
hours; yet these circumstances were exhibited in every series of observations*,

The formation of dew was found to depend solely on the temperature of the bodies
upon which it was deposited, and it never appeared upon them till their temperatures
had descended below that of the dew-point in their locality, as found by obseryations
of a dry and wet bulb thermometer placed in their vicinity. The amount of water thus deposited was the greatest upon the 8ubstances whose
temperatures were the lowest : among these bodies glass was found to radiate heat
freely, and it very readily became wet with dew. In consequence of this property, the
tube of a naked thermometer, which was lying on a substance entirely free from
moisture, was frequently found covered by dew, and therefore it seemed probable that
the temperature exhibited by the instrument was not that of the body in question.
