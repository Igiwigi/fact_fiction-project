The foregoing considerations seem to render it obvious, that the diversities in
the form of the superficial cells do not afford any ground whatever for the establish-
ment of a corresponding multiplicity of specific types, but that they must rank as
individual variations to which there is scarcely any definite limit. If the originals of
Plate VII. figs. 5, 7, 9, 12 and. 15, had happened to have presented themselves to the
Systematist without any of the connecting forms, he might have been pardoned for
describing them as distinct species characterised by well-marked differences in the
form and arrangement of their cells; but no such differentiation can be admitted in
the face of the fact, that these are only extreme examples of variations, which show
themselves in a minor degree between almost every two specimens brought into com-

parison, and even between the different parts of the same disk. Moreover, when it
is borne in mind, that the animal basis on which the calcareous skeleton is moulded

is not a body of constant shape, provided with organs having a fixed relation one to
another, but is a mass of almost homogeneous sarcode, which in the living state is
continually undergoing changes of form, one part extending itself into psendopodia,
whilst another undergoes a corresponding contraction, a strong & priori improba-
bility is seen to exist, that, in animals of such organization, the form of the compo-
nent segments should possess that value as a specific character, which it can only
derive from constancy. 53.
