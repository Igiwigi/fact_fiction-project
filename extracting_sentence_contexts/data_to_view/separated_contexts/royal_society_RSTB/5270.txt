This branch I take to be the posterior spinal artery. Tt will be seen from the figure that this branch likewise sends branches to the rhombic
area ; these branches anastomose with rhombic branches of the anterior branch. There
is in fact a continuous plexus on the restiform body which is reinforced by the transverse
branches of the vertebral and basilar artery which arise at a higher level. There are therefore two longitudinal plexuses in relation to the posterior inferior
cerebellar arteryâ€”one lateral to the hypoglossal rootlets and one on the restiform body. A reference to fig. 10 showing the distribution in the crocodile reveals the same restiform
or rhombic plexus.
