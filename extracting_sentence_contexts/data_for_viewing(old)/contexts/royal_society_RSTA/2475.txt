two round corners of the cell phone. The FOV and the area of each detector are 85° and 1cm?,
respectively.

To further investigate the effects of user locations, we consider 100 cells with equidistant
spacing of 0.6m in x and y directions. The user is assumed to be standing in the middle of the
cell where his/her body is perpendicular to the floor and he/she always stands parallel to y
direction. As case study, we consider 10 example locations for the user denoted as P13, P28,
P31, Pa, P59, Pes, P72, Ps7, Poo and Pig¢ (i.e. indicated with yellow squares in figure 19).
For the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality, the effective channel responses as seen
by photodetector D5 are illustrated in figure 21 assuming cut-off frequency of f cut—off = 20 MHz
[79]. It is observed that the low-pass characteristics of LED result in some attenuation towards
higher frequencies. It is also observed that in the effective channel responses of P13, Pi9,6 and Po,10
frequency selectivity is more pronounced. It is a result of the fact that these locations are close to
the walls ( figure 19) and, therefore, more reflected rays are received. It might be also interesting
to observe somehow different channel characteristics observed for P;,3 and P31, although these
locations are symmetrical in space. This is mainly due to the position of the user who stands
