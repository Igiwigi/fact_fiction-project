This solution is then extracted with ether, and on evaporation the
prisms are deposited. I have investigated the physiological actions of this substance by the same methods
as those employed for the previously described bodies, and have found these actions
to entirely correspond with those of the fatty aldoximes, more especially propyl-
aldoxime. In the presence of this fact it is interesting to observe that the molecular
weight of acetoxime is exactly equivalent to that of propylaldoxime. It will there-
fore be unnecessary to do more than merely point out the salient features. General Actionâ€”The general action of acetoxime in frogs resolves itself into
depression of the spinal cord.
