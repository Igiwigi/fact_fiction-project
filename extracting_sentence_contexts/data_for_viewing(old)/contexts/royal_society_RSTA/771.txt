problem is to realize the optimal balance points or curve of the trade-off between transmission
efficiency and security level. To do this at the fully quantum level is completely an open question.
Even in the classical framework where the channel matrices are just given as classical probability,
more research studies are still on-going. Needless to say, experimental investigations in realistic
environments have been quite lacking.

In this paper, we study a wiretap channel model in free space optical (FSO) communications,
such as satellite-to-ground, airborne-to-ground and drone-to-drone laser communications. In
such wireless communications, we can reasonably relax the assumptions on Eve, because they
are basically line-of-sight communications. So Eve cannot be in the main lobe of the channel,
otherwise she can be easily visible, and hence it is reasonable to assume that Eveâ€™s channel can be
physically bounded. Under such an assumption, one may pursue higher transmission rate than
that of QKD. In fact, long distance FSO channels are usually very lossy, and a key rate of QKD
becomes very small. We first review our theory of physical layer security and its implementation
in FSO communications system [14] and then present our experimental results with a 7.8km
terrestrial FSO wiretap channel.

2. Theory of physical layer security

In this section, we focus on secret message transmission in a wiretap channel. A wiretap channel
consists of the main channel with which Alice transmits a confidential message to Bob and the
wiretapper channel with which Eve attempts to observe the confidential message. A conceptual
view is shown in figure 1. The symbols for Alice, Bob and Eve are defined as x, y and z, drawn
from the binary random variables X, Y and Z, respectively. The main and wiretapper channels
are mathematically represented by the transition probabilities Wg(y|x) and W_(z|x), respectively,
