bition of Mek [8,53]. Since Dusp9 is an Erk phosphatase, it is,
however, expected to reduce Erk phosphorylation, while
increasing pMek through the negative feedback. Since there
are conflicting reports whether Dusp9 augments or reduces
pErk its mechanism of action remains to be clarified [16,36].
Since Mek inhibition also reduces expression of Gsk3 target
genes and leads to an increase in Akt phosphorylation, an
inhibitor of the Mek/Erk pathway that acts downstream of
Erk could potentially account for all observed X-dosage-
dependent effects [8]. It is, however, likely that a combination
of different X-linked genes shapes the X-dosage phenotype.

The fact that X-dosage affects pluripotency and differen-
tiation has so far only been shown in mice since they are the
prime model system for mammalian development. In addition,
delayed in vivo development has been observed for female
embryos in several other species such as cows, rats and
humans [1]. For more detailed mechanistic studies, embryonic
stem cells from these species will be valuable model systems.
The use of human ESCs for studying X-dosage-dependent
effects has so far been hampered by the fact that most cell lines
adopt a state where one X-chromosome is at least partially
silenced [54]. A recent study has characterized the X-inactivation
status and the differentiation potential of a series of female
human ESC lines in detail [55]. The finding that lines with two
