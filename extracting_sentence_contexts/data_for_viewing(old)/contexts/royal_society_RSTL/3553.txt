and in like manner we find the same value for FT

the condition ai is verified.

But if we take 5—- i and © Fa in the same way, we find the former = 8in © and the

latter =0, 80 that in this case the condition is not verified. The geometrical meaning
of this is obvious; analytically it is merely an instance of a general fact, pointed ont
by Jacorr; namely, that the effect of two successive pseudo-differentiations with
respect to two independent variables, is not generally independent of the order of
operations.

If V be the potential of another body, given in position, upon the body considered,
then V is a function of 0, @, , and
