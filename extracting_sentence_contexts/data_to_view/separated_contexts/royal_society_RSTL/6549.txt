This action, which we have hitherto
been disposed to attribute to the mobility of hydrogen, and its consequent high con-
vective power, Professxor MAGNUS was led to regard as an effect of conduction ; and the
thought induced him to examine the conductibility of gases generally. The mode of
experiment adopted led him, not I think to the establishment of gaseous conductivity,
but to results substantially the same as those that T had previously obtained. In fact

the yery experiments devised to show conductivity showed im a very striking manner
the existence of athermancy, or opacity to radiant heat, in the case of a considerable
number of gases.
