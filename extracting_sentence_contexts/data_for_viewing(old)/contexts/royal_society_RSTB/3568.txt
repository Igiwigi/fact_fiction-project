But, however they do it, they ultimately come to the surface, and are found there
in a motile condition. If the light is sufficiently strong, a good proportion of them
will make their way to that side of the saucer nearest the light, and there form a
distinct green line at the edge of the water. As night comes on they gradually
disappear from this place, and become again distributed through the water, and by
the time it is dark the green line has completely vanished. Subsequently, the
surface of the water is found to be covered with a green scum of rounded off cells ;
a considerable number are also found in the same condition on the surface of the
mud, whilst a few remain swimming about in the water, but eventually most of
these also settle down in the rounded condition. They remain like this all night,
except that a certain number of them undergo division. The time at which this
takes place varies, but it is generally in full swing at about 10 P.M., and is usually
over by one or two the next morning. It may here be remarked as an interesting fact
that if a portion of this non-motile scum is placed at any time during the night in
a good light, such as that from an incandescent gas mantle concentrated by a
condenser, the organisms in a very short time become motile again, and any divisions
which have begun are finished whilst the organism is in this motile condition. So
also, under these conditions, motile cells may start dividing and go through the
whole process of division in the motile stage.

As soon as it becomes sufficiently light the next morning, the Euglenze begin to
pass into the motile condition again, and are seen moving towards the source of light
