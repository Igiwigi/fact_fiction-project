326 MR. W. CROOKES ON REPULSION RESULTING FROM RADIATION.

PART III.

125. Ix my previous papers on this subject * the experiments described have had for
their object the demonstration of the broad facts of repulsion resulting from radiation,
In Part I., after satisfying myself that the action was not due to air-currents or elec-
tricity, I went rapidly over bodies of the most diverse chemical and physical characters,
organic and inorganic, metallic and non-metallic, dense and light, in spheres, disks, and
thin plates, endeavyouring to find, from their behaviour when free to move in a vacuum,
what conditions were necessary to obtain the strongest movement under the influence
of radiation, and what were unnecessary. I ascertained that chemical constitution had
little or nothing to do with the action. I said (par. 75) Â© the law appears to be that
the force exerted is in proportion to the extent of surface exposed, rather than in pro-
portion to the mass. Much surface and extreme lightness are the requisites in selecting
materials for the beam, index, or gravitating mass; and when the masses have the same
specific gravity and extent of surface, their position in respect to the 8ource of heat
determines the extent of movement. 'Thus a cylinder of pith is more sensitive when
