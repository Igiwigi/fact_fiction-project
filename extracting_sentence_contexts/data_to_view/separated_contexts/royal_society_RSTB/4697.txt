From the series of sketches in text-fig. 4 (which is fully explained in the legend) the
reader can follow the behaviour of the stelar bundles and off-coming traces in a typical
example. An examination of my sections reveals a rather peculiar state of affairs,
which makes it impossible to give a categoric answer to the question: Are there foliar
gaps in T'mesipteris? In the transition region as well as in the greater part of the

} It is noteworthy that the same peculiarity is shown by the leaf traces of Asterorylon (see p. 161 below).

§ This fact might indicate that the scales on the transition region represent merely the apiculi of leaves
that are for the most part coalescent with the axis,

leafy shoot the great majority of the gaps in the stele have no constant relation to
the leaf-traces and must be regarded as
“perforations.” As Prof. JEFFREY has
shown, the vascular supply to the leaves
and sporangiophores (which he regards as
sporophylls) is usually nipped off tan-
gentially or almost tangentially from the
stelar bundle,* and in such cases leaf-gaps
are naturally out of the question.
