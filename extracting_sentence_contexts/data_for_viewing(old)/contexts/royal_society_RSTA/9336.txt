of NaS . 9H,O resulted in little or no change in the «-photograph. On continuing the
treatment, photographs taken at various intervals up to 22 hours showed a gradual loss
of orientation in the crystallites. but the disarrangement was by no means complete
at the end of this period. It was, however, observed that the commencement of the
change in the «-photograph was marked by the onset, after 2? hours’ immersion, of a
new swelling phenomenon through which the length of the fibres increased by as much
as 50 per cent. without the application of external tension (see note above on hedgehog
spines). On transferring the fibres from the solution to pure water, the longitudinal
swelling subsided and was replaced by an increased lateral swelling.

It is obvious, if only from these brief notes, that the problem of the interaction of
Na,S and the keratins is one of extraordinary interest and no little complexity ; in
fact, one may safely say that it is the problem of the structure of the keratins them-
selves. It would be indefensible at this stage to rush to hasty conclusions, but it is
hard to resist the suggestion that the liberation by Na,S of free —S—S— and —SH.,
the sudden intensification by the same reagent of the @-phase or of some close derivative,
the similarity in spacing and intensity between the chief reflection of cystine and that
of the @-phase, and the crystallographic deduction that this spacing is very likely the
half-length of the cystine molecule, are all aspects of one and the same structural feature,
that in the 8-form of the keratins there are molecular chains linked side-to-side by molecules
of cystine or cysteine.

In the later stages of the reaction between stretched hair and sodium sulphide
it would seem that the molecular chains, themselves, are also ruptured, with the
