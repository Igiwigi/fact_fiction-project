In fig. 10 we have a tangential section of a
strobilus, cut vertically in a plane a little external to the margins of the disks, and con-
sequently passing through three verticils of disk rays, e’, e’, e’, where they are free from
their respective disks. Immediately above each of these verticils, we have at f, f, very
distinct rows of sporangiophores, now wholly free from the disk-rays upon which they
simply rest. All these combined facts demonstrate that we have in this strobilus a
condition to which I have seen no parallel elsewhere. There are many cases in which a single verticil of sporangiophores springs, like the
solitary one, /, shown in fig. 5, from each axil formed by the junction of the nodal disk
with the internodal cortex. It is so in the strobili of Calamites described in my
Memoir XTV., but in this case each sporangiophore carries all the four sporangia which
oceupy that radial segment of the internodal circle of which they form a part.
