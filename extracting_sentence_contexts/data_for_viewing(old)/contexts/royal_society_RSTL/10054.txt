he had never seen any communication between the central cavity and the lymphatic
vessels. He considers that the thymic corpuscles are changed into blood corpuscles ;
in describing the circulation he gave drawings of the thymus after it had been injected
from the arteries and the veins, and found that the arteries run into the centre of the
follicles, and ramify outwards, and that the larger veins are on the outside.

Mer.cnron (60), 1859, in his dissertation dealt chiefly with the pathology of the
thymus,

TuRXER (61), 1860, noticed a thymus in an adult Porpoise and in an adult Antelope.

HirzeL and FRey (62), 1863, wrote on the hibernating gland. They noticed the
fact that if these glands are exposed to the air they assume a dark red-brown colour.

K6L11KER (54), 1863, adhered in great measure to his former yiew. He described
the star-shaped cell network in the follicles, and noticed large cells with multiple
nuclei, He confirmed the fact observed by HewsoN (10) and His (46), that the
lymphatic vessels contain very many corpscules, similar to those of the thymus, and
described the simple concentric corpuscles as having a granular mass in their interior ;
he did not think that they arise from the gland cells.

Pavinzky (49), 1863, compared the concentric corpuscles to the corpora amylacea.
He adhered to the view that the elements undergo fatty degeneration. PAULIZKY'S
drawings of the concentric corpuscles and of the granular cells are very good. He
noticed, as REMAK (57) and JeExDRAsIK (30) had previously done, that the concentric
