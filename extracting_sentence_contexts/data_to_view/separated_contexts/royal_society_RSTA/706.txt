In contrast, just above the -point
strong modulations appear along the y-direction as diffraction starts to play a stronger role. Figure 3 was computed with full dipole fields, but with the parameters used it turns out that
including only the 1/r terms of the field is enough to induce the observed modulations. In fact, for
the modulation along y, only the long-range y-component of the dipole fields of the nanoparticles
is required. This is not too surprising, because the lattice period is quite large compared with the
assumed nanoparticle size.

(b) Observables

Experimentally, one will not measure the dipoles, but rather quantities derived from them. Then
the question arises: how is the underlying spatial inhomogeneity of the dipoles reflected in the
actually observed quantities?
