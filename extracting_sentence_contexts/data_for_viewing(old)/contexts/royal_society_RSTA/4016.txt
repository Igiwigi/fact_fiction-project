of CO2 or various toxic fluids, for which a much higher seismicity than in fracking has been
experienced.

A realistic model for hydraulic crack growth will probably allow increasing the fracked volume
portion and thus the percentage of gas extraction. This should further lead to cracks of denser
spacing, with smaller and more uniform opening width, which will have a welcome effectâ€”
a decrease in the amount of water per crack surface area, which will reduce the amount of
water required for injection, decrease the return of contaminated water per unit amount of gas
produced, and thus bring about a beneficial environmental side effect.
