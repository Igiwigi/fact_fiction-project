Accepted: 4 July 2016 species only spend around 15% of the day in flight during migration, posing a
question as to why flight times for many species are so short. Here, we test the
idea that hyperthermia might constrain flight duration (FD) ina short-distance

flights were limited by heart rate, together with the fact that the numerous
stops could not be explained by the need to feed, as the frequency of dives
and the time spent feeding were comparatively small during the migratory
period. We thus conclude that hyperthermia appears to be the predomi-
nant determinant of the observed migration strategy, and suggest that such
a physiological limitation to FD may also occur in other species.
