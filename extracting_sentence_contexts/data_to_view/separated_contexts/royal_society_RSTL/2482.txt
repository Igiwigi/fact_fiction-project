OF METAMORPHOSES IN THE CRUSTACEA. 319

for the latter opinion in their comparatively less perfect organization, a circumstance
to which a completely analogous case exists amongst the Zyperiide in the order Am-
phipoda, &e. Zoe, indeed, is not the only animal respecting which this kind of para-
sitic obscurity exists ; the genus Meloe amongst the coleopterous insects is perfectly
analogous, the young of which, according to some authors, are Acari, whilst others
state them to resemble the perfect insect. I am the more anxious to offer this
explanation of Mr. Txowyson's argument, in as much as the facts subsequently
stated respecting the ova and young of the Brachyura are totally at variance with
Mr. TrxomsoN's assertions. Thirdly, As respects Mr. TwomysoN's statements relative to the young of the com-
mon Lobster, we have again to regret the slightness of the information given to us
upon this branch of the subject. The young is called a modified Zoe, a cheliferous
Schizopode, with a frontal spine, a spatulate tail, and wanting subabdominal fins,
undergoing a metamorphosis less in degree than the other mentioned genera.
