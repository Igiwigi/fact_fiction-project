obtained by different observations, The optical thickness is assumed to be 100 pape
The circles indicate the extreme errors which could be due to errors in colour estima-
tion. The other observations represented by A and B, and the group represented by
C, do not require special remark. The principal deductions which can be made from
these observations are as follows :—

(1.) The points do not lie on a straight line inclined at 45° to the axes. Henee
the conductivity of the interior of the film is different from that of the
liquid in mass.

(2.) The points A, B, D, and the centre of the group C, lie nearly on a straight
line. If, therefore, we waive the objection above pointed out with regard to
D, and note the fact that the group W certainly does not lie on this line,
the facts are consistent with the theory that the film consists of an interior

of different conductivity from the liquid in mass, bounded by pellicles of
different conductivity from itself, and that when it becomes thin (about
300 y.p.), new forces (presumably surface forces) modify the conductivity in
a way which can be approximately represented by supposing that the con-
duetivity of the interior alone alters.
