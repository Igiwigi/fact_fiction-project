alkalies, may be separated with the greatest facility by silver-salts ; in fact, the nitrate,
the sulphate, the oxide of silver, behave with the iodine-compound exactly as with
iodide of potassium or sodium. On adding nitrate of silver to a solution of the iodide,
iodide of silyer is at once precipitated and a nitrate remains in solution, which on
evaporation crystallizes in deliquescent needles. With sulphate of silver, a perfectly
similar change takes place, an analogous suIpbate remaining in solution. During
these interchanges the liquids remain perfectly neutral. If the solution of the iodide
be digested with freshly precipitated protoxide of silver, the solution at once assumes
a powerfully alkaline reaction, iodide of silver being formed : the same effect is pro-
duced by the action of caustic baryta upon the sulphate, sulphate of baryta being
precipitated. These reactions, when viewed collectively, exhibit a striking analogy
between the new iodide and the metallic iodides, especially those of the alkali-metals.
In fact the molecular group combined with iodine, in the compound under examina-
tion, behaves like sodium or potassium ; it is a true organic metal in all its bearings.
For this metal I propose, on the ground of its formation and composition, the name
Tetrethylammonium (76pa), which implies that it is built up by the intimate union
of nitrogen with four equivalents of the hypothetical hydrocarbon called ethyl, and
that it may be viewed as ammonium, in which the whole of the hydrogen is replaced
by an equiyalent proportion of the aboye hydrocarbon.
