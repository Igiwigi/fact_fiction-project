interval anterior to the time of observation for which the moon's place is to be taken
as governing the diurnal tide at the time of observation ; the constant coefficient by
which the sine of moon's declination for that anterior time is to be multiplied ; the
moon's hour-angle at the time of lunar diurnal high water; and the three similar
quantities for the sun: in all, six unknown quantities. To determine these we have
only the four following results of observation (or results equivalent to these four) :
the time of evanescence of diurnal tide at semidiurnal high water; the maximum of
diurnal tide in high water, and the two similar quantities for low water. These are
insufficient for the determination of the six unknown quantities ; and we must try
how we can reduce the latter number.

First, as the sun's declination is considered constant, the anterior interval for the
sun's place is unimportant. And in fact, though the sun's declination during these
observations (June 22 to August 25) was not invariable, yet an alteration of one day
in the time for which its declination was taken as ruling the diurnal tide would not
have been important. For the moon it would be very important.

Secondly, it seems probable that the moon's hour-angle at the time of lunar diurnal

high water does not differ much from the sun's hour-angle at the time of solar diurnal
high water. The assumption of any constant difference, either =0 or having any
assigned magnitude, reduces two of the unknown quantities to one.
