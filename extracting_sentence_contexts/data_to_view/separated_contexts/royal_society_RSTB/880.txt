Either cane sugar or grape sugar will give rise to this appearance
starch. What the antecedent condition of the diastase may be, or whether it
secreted by the protoplasm when required, is a point that will be referred to later. One more curious fact with regard to the diastase of the pollen of L. pardalir


POLLEN GRAIN AND THE NUTRITION OF THE POLLEN TUBE. 399

â€˜be narrated here. Attempting to confirm the initial diminution of diastase on
ommencement of germination, as described above, the pollen was found to have
its power of putting out tubes. Out of a large quantity sown, very few grains
ommenced growing, It seemed desirable to investigate the diastatic power of
sollen in this condition, and to see whether any connection could be traced
en the power of germinating and the activity of the enzyme.
