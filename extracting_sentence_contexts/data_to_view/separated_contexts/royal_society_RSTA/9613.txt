The mixture left in the flask after concluding the experiments with the tantalum
lamp, proved on examination to be very acid. The clear liquid obtained on filtering,
contained in addition to acids, ferrous, ferric, and silver salts; the undissolved portion
which was somewhat yellow, contained metallic silver, silver nitrate and some salts of
iron. We must now leave the chemical problem here presented to be more fully
dealt with in some future communication; but from the remarks made, it will be
abundantly evident that the chemical equation set forth on p. 230 gives but a very

incomplete representation of the actual facts; that equation may indeed represent
VOL, COXIL.â€”A. 24
