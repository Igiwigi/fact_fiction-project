this is obviouslythe case, for if the equation could be identicallysatisfied wemight make
Mhea=ili (thorn lat ll = Une

and we should then he able-to find v,,, as-a real numerical multiple of z,, and con-
sequently shonld have the equation u4.{1 +} =0, which is obviously impossible ;
& fortiori we may prove that in; the identical, equation existing between the sum of
an even number of positive and, of negative squares of real linear functions of half
the number of independent variables, there cannot be more than a difference of two
(as we have proved that there cannot be, that difference) between the number of
positive and negative $8quares. Hence there must be as many of one as of the other ;
and'as a" consequenee,‚Äù the number of positive 8quares or of negative squares in
the, transform. of a, given quadratic /function- of: any number of yariables effected by
any set, of real linear substitutions is constant, being in fact s0me unknown trans-
cendental function of the coefficients of the given function. ' I quote this law (which
I. have enunciated before, but of which 1 for tbe: first time publish the proof) under
the name of the law of inertia for quadratic forms.

Art. (45.). The other theorem. is the following... If any quadratic function be repre-
sented in the umbral notation* under the form.of (a/z; +a, 2+... +4,,)% where @,,
