L. GLAISHER ON THE THEORY OF ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS. 511

which was required in the verification, is best obtained by deducing it from the well-
known theorem
cosz , cos 2p co8 37 __ = cosh(&r—Pz) 1 =

from which, by writing 36 for Þ and 27 for &, dividing the equation s0 obtained by 4,
and subtracting it from (47), we find

cos , co837 T (cosh (&r—þz) cosh (48r— Px)

It is to be noticed that (46) is only true if & lies between 0 and p. 'This may be
regarded as a consequence of the fact that (47) only holds good when z is positive
and less than 27; but the necessity for the condition is also evident from the process of
verification by ordinary algebra. Thus the expression in (46)

2cosh &  2cosh 37
SET 1+&%

Se: —&e.|

==> —2(C +87 (e*—e*+e-%—&C.)+2(6* +87) (e*—6-%+&%—., .)—&e.

=s8ech x—sech (x—w)—sech (x +þp)+ &c.,

wherein we see that to justify the 8ummations of e-*—e-*+&c, and &*—e&* + &e.
as ordinary geometrical progressions we must suwppose & to be positive and less than w. Also since sech z—sech (z—p)—sech(v+)+&c. is periodic, while the expression in
(46) is not $0, we see that the equality will not hold good beyond these limits.
