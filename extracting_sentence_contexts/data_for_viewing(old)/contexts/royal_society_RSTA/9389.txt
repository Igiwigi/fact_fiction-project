On the other hand, it differs from the B value in the fact that it varies with temperature
whilst the B value does not so vary over the range explored, namely, from 4° to 56° C.
‘Temperature may, however, alter the distance h between the enclosing solids, the
cylinder and the plate, in which event comparison at different temperatures would not
be made between comparable states.

An attempt was made to get the normal reaction of a fluid joint uncomplicated by
tangential flow by supplying the necessary lateral support. Osborn Reynold’s principle
of dilataney suggested the method. A thin skin was applied to the edge of a joint of
solid lubricant by varnishing with Necol, or a strong solution of gelatine, and allowing
the varnish to dry, The lubricant was then melted by raising the temperature and
the joint broken. The value of adhesion was now much greater than value A. The
capacity which impurities possess for penetrating a fluid joint make it certain, however,
