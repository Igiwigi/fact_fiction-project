11. Marble. Lot 38, Range VIII, Township of Anstruther, Ontario.—Practically
identical with 10 jn every respect. A microphotograph of a thin section of a highly
granulated portion of this rock is shown on Plate 25, fig. 4. It is photographed
hetween crossed Nicols in polarised light and is magnified 70 diameters.

12. Marble. Lot 29, Range XI, Township of Cardiff, Ontario—A very fine-
grained marble, through which are distributed occasional large twisted calcite
remnants, which indicate that the rock in its present form has resulted from the
granulation of a coarsely crystalline marble. The rock bears a very strong resem-
blance to No. 4, but the granulation is more advanced and the calcite remnants less
numerous. The granulated portion of the rock is also identical with that of No. 10;
in fact, No. 10, if more completely granulated, would be identical in character with
this rock.

13. Limestone. Lot 28, Range XI., Township of Monmouth, Ontario.—At two
places in this township (Nos. 13 and 14) the coarsely crystalline white limestone of
the Laurentian contains somewhat irregular-shaped streaks or bands which are bluish-
black in colour and very fine in grain. These are portions of the original limestone in
a comparatively unaltered condition. In these bluish-black portions the calcite
grains are very small, and have the dark carbonaceous colouring matter distributed
all through their substance. An enlargement of 500 diameters is required for their
study. With this power the rock is seen to be perfectly crystalline, the minute
calcite individuals being fitted together along boundaries which are smooth or in some
cases slightly crenulated. The grains are usually distinctly flattened, but this is not
