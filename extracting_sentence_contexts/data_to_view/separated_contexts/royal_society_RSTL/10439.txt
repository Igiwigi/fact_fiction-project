Instead of the latter parb of (21), in which, however, the law of either series is
manifest, we may use its development according to descending powers of a, which is

A The expression for the correction for the internal air will be gob from the above by
changing the 8ign of ma and of the whole, or, in other words, by changing the signs
Sof the 2nd, 4th, 6th . . . terms in the series in (21) or (22), It will be remembered
Sthat ma is f(cos 45*+! 8in 45*).

'Z In the previous experiments the main loss of energy arising from the friction of the
Zair may be characterised as being due to the fact that the air is pushed. A small
Sportion, however, of the loss is occasioned by the rotation of the cylinders or spheres
Zabout their own axes, and in this case the air may be said to be dragged. Professor
