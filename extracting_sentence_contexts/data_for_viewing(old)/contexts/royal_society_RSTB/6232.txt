moderate conditions of temperature and humidity with varying mortality.

Extreme limits: the thermal death points were ascertained when puparia were
exposed for one hour in an atmosphere of 50% relative humidity in a water bath
at a constant temperature. By weighing at intervals it was possible to ascertain
whether death occurred soon after exposure to unfavourable conditions (and
probably as a result of them) or at a subsequent date (p. 217). In the latter case,
puparia were recorded as having survived exposure. After exposure, all puparia
were kept at 24°—28° C in a relative humidity of 50%.

Table XVII shows the results of these experiments on both species. In nearly
every instance the upper temperature limit is sharply defined. Two significant
facts are observed : (a) that in both species the thermal death point of puparia
exposed on the 15th day is higher by 2° C (3-6° F) than that of those on the Ist day ;
and (6) that on both the Ist and 15th days the thermal death point of Glossina

submorsitans is 1° C higher than that of tachinoides. Results of exposures on the Ist
and 15th days are not comparable with those on the 22nd—27th, since in the latter
emergences are recorded, and those which failed to emerge may have survived the
experiment but died subsequently. The thermal death point of submorsitans puparia
exposed on the 15th day is the same as that found by Nasu for puparia exposed
for a day on the surface of the soil (Nasu, 1933a, p. 181). All puparia were
