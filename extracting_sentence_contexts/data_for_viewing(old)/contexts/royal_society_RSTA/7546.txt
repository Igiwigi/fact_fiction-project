Thus, if, k, p, r are all distinct there is just one independent invariant of degrees 3, 2, 2, 1, 1
in assigned quadratics; and there are no irreducible invariants if), k, p, r are not all different.
Hence we have the single set of forms (Turnbull 1910)

[13] 1 : 0 . 9 © Orders (0,0). Degrees {32717}. One form.

Dually, =0.

10. The other forms of grade six are bilinear forms of the type ss . Ps
fact all reducible, but the analysis which demonstrates this is somewhat lengthy. Just as in§9,
there is at least one symbol common to the upper and lower rows in the product. We denote
this symbol by 7, the remaining upper symbols by j, & and the remaining lower symbols
by p, g. We have, for an irreducible form, j, k, p, gi, j+=k, p+ q, but there are forms of this
kind not obviously reducible with, e.g. / = k, and we make, at present, no hypothesis as to
the inequality of such symbols.

We first enumerate the possible forms of this type with ijk as upper symbols and tpg as lower
symbols, omitting these which are clearly reducible on account of the presence of a factor j;.
These forms are sixteen in number, namely
