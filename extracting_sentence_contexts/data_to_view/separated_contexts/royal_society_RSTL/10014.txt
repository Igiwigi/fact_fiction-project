In the first place, the constitution of a liquide glycorique is more difficult to main-
tain unaltered than that of a s0ap solution. Tt is, however, in films formed with
the latter that the greatest apparent variations in thickness occur. This, on the
other hand, is in accord with the fact that films formed without glycerine are, as is
proved by the colour phenomena they display, more uncertain and irregular in their
behaviour than those made of the standard solution. Again, if a change of con-
stitution took place, we should probably have detected it by progressive changes
in the calculated thickness, which would in reality have been due to alterations

\in the specific resistance. Finally, the absolute constancy of the hygrometer and
thermometer seem to preclude the possibility of any considerable change of constitu-
tion even in a black film.
