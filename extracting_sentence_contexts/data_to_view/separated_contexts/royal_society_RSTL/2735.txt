Let it be supposed that the ocean-spheroid assumes a form
agreeing with the equilibrium-spheroid at the moment, and that the pole of this
spheroid follows the position of the pole of the equilibrium-spheroid at a certain
mean interval, say 90*. Let it be supposed that at a certain time a tide is sent off
from this ocean-spheroid along a channel in which it is no longer affected by the
moon or sun, and thus reaches Liverpool, producing the tide there. The following
assumptions will then represent the facts. When the horizontal parallax is 54', the tide is sent off along the channel in lon-
gitude 482? east of Liverpool, at 45" 6" before the time of Liverpool high water, and
the pole of the ocean-spheroid follows the position of equilibrium at a distance 90?
