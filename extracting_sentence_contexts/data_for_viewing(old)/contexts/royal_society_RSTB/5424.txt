Korscueir and Herper (1909) in their classification of germ-layer formation in yolky
Crustacean embryos take Mysis as an example of a type of development where the mid-
gut is formed “ unter Umwachsung des Nahrungsdotters ” found in the Peracarida and
Leptostraca. This group they contrast with those showing the mid-gut formed “ unter
Durchwanderung des Nahrungsdotters ” in the majority of the Decapoda, and with the
Astacus type “unter Filtration des Nahrungsdotters.”” It is evident that KorscueLr
and Hrrper are comparing the liver formation in the Peracarida with that of the mid-gut
in the Decapoda! The true mid-gut of the Peracarida is formed by yolk cells, and if the
endoderm formations of the Peracarida and Decapoda are to be compared, then that
comparison must lie between the yolk cells in the two groups.

In the Decapoda Sotaup (1923) has called attention to the fact that the mid-gut
formed ‘“‘ unter Durchwanderung des Nahrungsdotters ” is not separable fundamentally
from the Astacus type “ unter Filtration des Nahrungsdotters.” A number of inter-
mediate conditions occur between the yolk cells which wander entirely without order,
as in the Palemoninew, and the united orderly migration of the endodermal elements in
Astacus (pp. 175-78). In the Peracarida the yolk cells may wander independently through
the yolk as in the Cumacean [phine (BouTCHINSKY, 1897, p. 387) and various Amphipods
(Herpecke, 1904, and Rossuskaya and KoscHEwnikow4, 1891). In Hemimysis they
wander independently but remain on the surface of the yolk, while in Oniseus (BOBRETSKY,
1874) at first they behave as in Hemimysis, but later wander directly into the yolk.
Finally, in the Amphipod Microdeutopus (LANGENBECK, 1898) the yolk cells are formed
by an invagination of a regular formed layer of cells, which, however, later disorganise
and spread separately through the yolk. These differences in behaviour of the yolk cells
