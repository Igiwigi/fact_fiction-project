than that displayed in fig. 3.

In fig. 5 the rods are cut through, by a somewhat oblique section, immediately
below the cranial capsule ; the © investing mass,” the rudimentary first vertebra (v. 1),
and the enclosed notochord are displayed in this section, and also the shape of the
mouth-chasm. Fig. 6 is a little lower down, and shows what fig. 5 does not, namely,
the top of the sixth arch, or third branchial ; here the inner walls of the cheeks are seen
to some extent. Lower down till (fig. 7) we see the floor of the mouth, with the rudi-
mentary tongue (79.); and behind the arches, only five of which could be clearly seen,
we have the large yelk-mass (y.) with its emarginate front outline. Expecting to find
the earliest condition of the © trabeculee ” (first pair of rods) in the ammocetine condition
(that is, continuous with the © investing mass ”), these sections cost me much thought,
and these obseryations were repeated again and again. The fact is that the /ast of the
arches comes nearest to the inyesting mass, and not the firs, and it is wholly distinct
from the axial structures,

Thus we see that © the branchial arches have the same morphological value as the
hyoid, and the latter as the mandibular arc ” (HvxLzy, © Croonian Lecture,” p. 53); and
not only 80, but the © trabecule cranii” are merely the foremost of these arches, as
both of us have for some time felt satisfied.

In the earliest condition of my * first stage ” (fig. 7), although these thick rods gra-
dually decrease in size from before backwards, yet the first are twice as thick as the
