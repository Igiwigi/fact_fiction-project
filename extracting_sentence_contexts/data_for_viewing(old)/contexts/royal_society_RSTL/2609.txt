I have thought it right to enter into these details, not only that chemists
may judge of the accuracy of my experiments by the care with which they
were conducted, but because the error committed by Dr. Txomson appears
referable to the neglect of some of these precautions. This opinion seems the
more probable, since Dr. Txomsox is uncertain whether in his original experi-
ments he did not employ the muriate of baryta of commerce, and if s0 he
doubtless must have operated with an impure substance. But independently
of any inaccuracy arising from this source, I shall now endeavour to prove that
his method involves an error which precludes an exact result even with the
purest materials. When solutions of muriate of haryta and sulphate of potash
are mixed together, a small portion of the latter invariably escapes decompo-
sition, and falls tenaciously adhering to the sulphate of baryta. I was led to
this fact by observing, that when a known quantity of chloride of barium is
precipitated: by sulphate of potash, the resulting sulphate of baryta always
weighed more than when the precipitation was made with pure sulphuric acid.
The appearance of the salts after exposure to a red heat, was likewise different;
the impure sulphate being harder, more brittle, and less opaque than the pure
sulphate. The former reduced to powder and boiled with water, yielded a 80-

lution which precipitated barytic salts freely, and afforded certain evidence of
the presence of potash with muriate of platinum.
