This representation is only possible when the subjacent succession of lines is insisted
upon.

Art. 44, Every Sylvester-graph in two dimensions is representative of two
unipartite partitions ; it may, in fact, be read by lines or by columns, and when the
two readings are identical the graph is said to be self conjugate.

In this enlarged theory every graph denotes 3! graphically-regularised multi-
partite partitions ; of the same total content, but not, as a rule, appertaining to the
same multipartite number.

Take coordinate axes as shown, the axis of z beiag perpendicular to the plane of
the paper. We read as follows :â€”

Planes parallel to the plane wy and in direction Ox

Planes parallel to plane zy and in direction Oy
