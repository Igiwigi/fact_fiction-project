Thus, a control parameter in a duct-like flow must be a parameter other than Q. The
herringbone mixer of Stroock et al. (2002) has no independent control parameter. The mixers by Tabeling et al. (2004) and Bottausci et al. (2004) have two control
parameters: an amplitude and a frequency of pressure gradients producing cross-flows
(the system of Bottausci et al. in fact has three pairs). Examples of other control
parameters include speed of moving parts (impellers and so on), frequency of time-
dependent electric fields. All these devices allow for optimization without changing
the device itself.
