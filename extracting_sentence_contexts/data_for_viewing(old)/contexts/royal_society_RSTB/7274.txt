(iii) The secondary reproductive system

The vagina and the common oviduct. The efferent system consists of the wide tube of the
common oviduct which extends along the eighth abdominal segment and joins the short
vestibule of the vagina at the posterior border of the eighth sternite. The epithelial wall of
the common oviduct is thin in most of its course, and in some parts it lies very close to
the body wall formed by the eighth sternite. Its most proximal portion is rather thick

walled where the two ovaries join at its sides. This fact suggests that the cells at the proximal
end retain their capacity to divide in order to fuse with the distal ends of the ovaries and
to replace the last remnants of the mesodermal oviducts when these are removed to free
passage for the eggs.

The spermatheca. There are two spermathecae which are almost independent of each other
(figure 2) except at the very distal end, where they discharge by one opening. This opening
is situated on a little nipple-like protrusion on the dorsal wall of the vagina, slightly
posterior to the vulvar opening and separated from it by the vaginal apodeme. The middle
part of each of the spermathecal ducts is surrounded by a number of enormous glandular
cells which cluster round the spermathecal duct in a mulberry-like fashion. It is obvious
that these cells have a secretory function, as shown by the vacuoles at their inner ends and
