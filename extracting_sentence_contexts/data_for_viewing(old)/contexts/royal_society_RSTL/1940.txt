systems of muscles, therefore, obviously partake of this remarkable action.

It is plain, from the preceding observations, that the reflex function may be
viewed as subsisting in its natural state, in its state of general excess or failure,
and in its state of momentary and partial excitement.

IH. Pathology.

There still remains an interesting part of this inquiry. What relation does
the reflex function bear to the art of physic? It will s0on be seen that it throws
a ray of light over some obscure points in medicine. Indeed the study of the
reflex function appears to me to reveal and explain a totally new order of facts
in pathology, and to lead to a new division of the diseases of the neryous sy-
stem, coinciding with the different modes of operation of their causes, into those
of centric and those of eccentric origin,
