It is not very difficult to combine a small quantity of mercury
with platina : but, to resolve the problem completely, and to pro-
duce an alloy of these metals which shall be of so low a specific
gravity as 11,3, and $hall be soluble in nitric acid, is not s0
easily accomplished. From the repeated failures which I have
experienced in these operations, I am much inclined to think
that the author of palladium has some method of forming it,
less subject to error than any I have mentioned. No doubt
that perseverance would put us in possession of his secret ;
but, being prevented by want of leisure from pursuing these
researches at present, I have confined myself to establishing the
fact, and describing the processes which I have employed.

Having thus acquired a certainty that mercury is a constituent
part of palladium, I made some further experiments upon it,
with a view to its analysis ; but they have not been attended with
s0 much success. It might be expected, from the great number
of methods which have failed to form palladium, that many
might be found to decompose it when formed. But I have
found the converse of such processes as did not succeed in pro-
ducing palladium, to be ineffectual in destroying the combination.
