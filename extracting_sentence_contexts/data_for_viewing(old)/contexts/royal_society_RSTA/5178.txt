positions, velocities and strengths of shed vorticity. The latter fact can be qualitatively indicated
by using a thin free-shear layer and boundary layer method as presented by Faltinsen &
Pettersen [23]. It follows then that the motion of the separation points as it is accounted for in
the nonlinear method causes a different expression for the amount of shed vorticity. Figure 8b
shows the heave damping coefficient B33 predicted by the two hybrid methods as a function of
heave amplitude.

In the semi-nonlinear hybrid method, the governing equations in the potential-flow domain
are linearized, meaning that contributions from the nonlinear advection terms in the Navier-
Stokes equation are not communicated to the potential flow domain. The consequence is that the
normal velocity and pressure are continuous across the interface, while the tangential velocity
at the interface is discontinuous. The result is artificial local vorticity on the viscous flow side
of the intersection. The latter fact was also observed by Greco et al. [24] in their studies with a
domain decomposition method involving linear potential flow and the Navier-Stokes equations.
Figure 9a illustrates that, during forced roll oscillation, we observed artificial vorticity at the
viscous flow side of the horizontal part of the intersection. However, for the nonlinear hybrid
method, the advection terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are communicated with the potential
flow domain (figure 9c).

From forced heave oscillation tests, the resulting liquid flow and generated vorticity are more
equal between the two methods (figure 9b-d). Here, the liquid flow is mostly normal to the
horizontal part of the intersection and no artificial vorticity is observed at the intersection.

From figure 8a, we cannot conclude on the relative importance for the roll response of (i)
nonlinear body-boundary conditions, (ii) motion of the separation points, and (iii) avoidance of
