former that tendency to assume regular forms with which the latter are endowed,
the separation of the proximate colouring or colour-giving (colorable) matters of
madder will be easy, and it will thus be possible to establish their elementary com-
position and thence their relation to one another,”

To Mr. J. Hiccin is due the merit of having first called attention to the fact, that
important changes take place during the process of dyeing with madder, which can
only be explained by supposing that an actual formation of colouring matter takes
place during the process. In his paper © On the Colouring Matters of Madderf,
Mr. Hiccin has detailed his experiments on that peculiar substance discovered in
madder by KUnLiMaxN and called by him Xanthine. I have shown, on a former occa-
Sion, that the xanthine of Kunimany and other investigators is not a pure substance,
but a mixture of two distinct substances. This fact however does not affect the cor-
rectness of Mr, Hiccin's conclusions, the general 'accuracy of which I shall have
great, pleasure in confirming in the course of this paper. The presence of xanthine
is easily ascertained by the deep yellow colour and intensely bitter taste which it
communicates to cold water. Guided by these two tests, Mr. Hiccix arrived at the
concInsion, that in an infusion of madder, made with cold or tepid water, when left
to itself, or more rapidly when heated to 120? or 130? Fanr., the xanthine gradually
disappears and there is formed a gelatinous or flocculent substance, which possesses
all the tinctorial power originally belonging to the infusion, while the liquid has lost
