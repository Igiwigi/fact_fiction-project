From the whole of the evidence the striking fact appears, that about three-fourths of
the gross increase in live-weight of animals * feeding ” for the butcher, will be dry or

Only about 7 or 8 per cent. of the gross increase, and scarcely more than one-tenth of
its total dry snbstance, will be nitrogenous compounds. Lastly, such increase
frequently contain less than 1, and seldom more than 14 per cent. of mineral matter.
