junctions in the species examined. There may be no interlamellar junctions at all
(Anomia, Pectunculus); septa may occur in certain filaments at regular intervals
(Lithodomus) ; septa of various heights in all filaments (Malleus) ; a single cross bar
in all filaments (Septifer); a cross bar and a low septum (Trigonia); a cross bar
situated high up and restricted to certain filaments at intervals (Melina); or three
cross bars in all filaments (Mytilus edulis). In the case of Melina the bar is
unusually thick, and is connected with the upper ends of several filaments at each of
its extremities.

In the plicate Eleutherorhabda (Spondylus, Pecten, Avicula, Meleagrina), and in
the plicate Synaptorhabda (except Pinna) the interlamellar junctions have the form
of septa, and are confined to the principal filaments, if such are differentiated. It is
a curious fact that in the great majority of these the septa are alternately high and
low, the former extending the full height of the ascending lamella, the latter not
rising more than one-half or three-quarters of the height. In a few cases (e.g.,
Psammobia ferroensis, Solen ensis, Solenocurtus rufus, Panopea generosa, Tapes
pullastra, Diplodonta oblonga) all the septa are high.

Septa are not uncommon in the non-plicate Synaptorhabda, and are frequently
thick and related at their edges with three or four filaments, particularly at the
levels of the interfilamentar junctions.

* KELLoce (42, p. 423) says that in Ostrew virginiana “ there is no constant septum,” thereby, I take it,
implying that it is present at intervals,
