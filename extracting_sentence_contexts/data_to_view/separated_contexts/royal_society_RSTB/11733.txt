Such intergenerational effects of early
life challenges are not easily reconcilable with strict genetic
inheritance, and raise many, sometimes provocative, questions
such as ‘when does early life start?’ or ‘is there a somewhat
Lamarckian component to acknowledge in evolution?’ Such
questions have fuelled a vivid and more and more audible
debate about the necessity to revise the Modern Synthesis of
evolution, the current frame of evolutionary theory, in order to
incorporate the patterns of inheritance that cannot be explained
by conventional mechanisms [8,20,21]. We show here how the recent fascinating discoveries that in
particular integrate early in life effects have some Lamarckian
flavour and how integrating them into the modern synthesis of
evolution has the potential to reconcile our neo-Darwinism
(the current Modern Synthesis) with the Lamarckian element
into a single inclusive evolutionary synthesis, which closely
resembles the Darwinism of the origin. We will show that
the key element of reconciliation lies in the fact that all pro-
cesses of parent-offspring resemblance seem to act and
enable adaptation at very different timescales and thus do
not conflict with but rather complement each other. A central
aspect of the current research programme calling for an
extended. [20,22,23] or inclusive [5,15,24] synthesis is that all
examples of transmission of acquired adaptations largely
lead us to reconsider concepts of heredity and call for the
crystallization of a much broader concept of inheritance [19]. We first briefly describe the history of the gene concept,
and define our main concepts in box 1.
