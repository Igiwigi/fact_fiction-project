Text-fig. 2 gives some idea graphically of the entire lack of co-ordination in the
reactions of the chromatophores. Not only is differentiation in reaction found between
the different types of chromatophore, but even between the melanophores belonging to
one marking and those of another. Explanations of differences between erythrophores,
xanthophores and melanophores can be given, based on the possible differences in the
direct effect of differently coloured lights on the various pigments, although no such
differentiation has been found as yet—in fact, Mast is convinced that the fish are
possessed of colour-vision and thus respond to the different colours. But in the case of melanophores possessing only slight variations in size, etc., there
can be little room for doubt in this direction. Three prominent instances of this occur
in the dab—the pale spots, the white marginal spots and the dark patches.
