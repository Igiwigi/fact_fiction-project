RAY LANKESTER ON THE

General considerations relative to the observations contained in the preceding
Contributions (Nos, I., II., II1.). Before leaving the preceding records of obseryations to the consideration of the reader,
I may point out briefly their bearing on two matters of theoretical importance, viz. (1)
the origin and significance of what has been called the Gastrula phase of development,
and (2) the homologies or homogenies (as I should prefer to say) of the shells, ligaments,
and internal pens of the Mollusca. More facts haye to be sought out and brought to
bear on these questions ; but whilst occupied in that further search, let me indicate the
anticipations which must guide and stimulate it. Before doing 80 T must mention that
there are a yariety of other matters of interest in the facts recorded in the preceding
pages which cannot yet be brought into any theoretical structure, but which I haye not
on that account kept back, as they will probably be of some service in their isolated
condition.

(1) KowaLpvsxy was the first to describe, in a precise manner, the formation of the
foundations of the alimentary tract in a developing embryo by invagination of the wall
of a simple primitive blastosphere, or hollow ball of embryonic cleayage-corpuscles. He detected this mode of development in Amphiozrs, and subsequently in Ascidia.
