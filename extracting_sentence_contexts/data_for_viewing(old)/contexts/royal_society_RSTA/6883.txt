equal to @) or 27—@,) can be obtained by using the approximation (20). On substituting
this in equation (28) and using (29), we find for the region S$

F(r, 0) = 0:0796 JO {cosec $(4) —@) +-cosec $(4)+0)} exp {- 2ni(; + 3)| , (32)
For the regions Q and R, the last two terms in the expressions (30) and (31) lead to precisely
q the same expression as on the left of (32). Hence, except when @ is nearly equal to @, or
S 2n—6p, the diffraction effects are represented at sufficiently great distances by circular
waves diverging from the open end of the breakwater, as given by (32). The amplitude of
these ‘diffraction’ waves decreases like 7~# as r increases, except near the edge of the geo-
2, metric shadow (@ = 0,), or near the edge of the region of reflexion (9 = 27—4,).

Along the edge of the geometric shadow (4 = 0), the expression (28) for F(r,@) reduces
to approximately 4 exp (—2zir/A) for large r; this value is, in fact, a fair approximation for
“4 values of r as small as 2A; for example, if @) = 60°, we find

Fir, 0) = 0-50 e-“* +-0-07 e~42" = for r = 2A, - (38)

S the + or — sign corresponding, as before, to the breakwater being of the rigid or cushion
5 type. Hence along the edge of the sheltered region § the height of the resultant waves is
reduced to one-half that of the incident waves. Further inside $, each wave crest is bent
3 round approximately into an arc of a circle centred at the open end of the breakwater, and
2 its height is progressively reduced, in accordance with the expression (32), as the breakwater
is approached. The expression (32) also shows that at points well inside S there is a phase lag
; of amount A/8. This indicates that, near the boundary of 5, the wave crest is bent round
rather more than would be required to make it coincide with a circular arc centred at the
