although it is quite possible that DRA is a common problem
in TED [6], each case is potentially unique and warrants a
fresh look before any definite conclusions are drawn.

(c) Dating the placental radiation

We find it encouraging that the total-evidence analysis pre-
sented here produces divergence time estimates that match
the fossil record closely despite the fact that we did not use
any direct constraints on node dates. The explosive radiation
scenario favoured by O'Leary et al. [8,14] places the placental
origin just after the K-Pg mass extinction at 66 Ma. It
requires both net diversification rates and rates of molecular
evolution during the early phases of placental evolution
that are unlikely considering other sources of evidence on
mammalian evolution [13]. Oâ€™Leary et al. contrasts the explo-
sive radiation scenario with a much-cited molecular-clock
study that uses node dating and places the origin of crown
placentals at 101 Ma [9]. Our TED analysis, under informa-
tive priors, halves the gap between these two estimates,
from approximately 36 to 16-19 Myr (table 1 and electronic
