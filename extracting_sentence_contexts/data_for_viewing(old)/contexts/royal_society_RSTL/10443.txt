This remarkable contras between the development of the filaments of the primary
and 8econdary polyps shows clearly that in searching for the relations between the
various groups of polyps, as indicated by their embryology, we are nob justified in
comparing the egg-development of one form with the bud-development of another, or
in taking the structure of the bud as any necessary indication of the succession of
the parts in the egg-embryo. That the importance of this prineiple has been
unconsciously disregarded will, I think, be clear from the following citations,

MostLEy writes in his admirable paper on Heliopora and Sarcophyton (Phil. Trans.
Vol. 166, 1876, p. 121): * It seems extremely difficult to reconcile the extraordinary
8uccession of the mesenteries in the development of the Zoantharians, discovered by
Lacaze-DuTaERs, with the facts presented by Alcyonarians. Did the development
of the eight mesenteries of Aleyonaria correspond with that of the firs eight
mexgenteries formed in Actiniade, the firss mesenteries formed would be either the
lateral dorsal or lateral ventral; but these are those which are most rudimentary in
the zooids of Sarcophyton. Moreover the mesenterial filaments of the two lateral
pairs of septa are in the development of Actiniades the first to appear, and nob the
dorsal, which are longest in the Alcyonarian polyps and most persistent in the
zooids. Apparently, however, development in Aleyonarians follows a different course.”

These words seem clearly to imply that the greater length of the dorsal filaments
and their persistence in the zooids indicates their earlier development in the embryo.
