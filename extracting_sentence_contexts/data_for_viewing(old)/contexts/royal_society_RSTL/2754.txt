AND ON THE DIURNAL INEQUALITY OF THE TIDES AT LIVERPOOL. 139

These differences in the value of « may arise from the lunar declination not being
completely eliminated in our previous calculation, the interpolation of the Table
being slightly inexact. But it is by no means improbable that they are the discrepan-
cies, arising from mechanical principles, which exist between the tides of water in
motion and the results of the equilibrium-hypothesis. The general agreement of the
equilibrium-theory with the facts (assuming « = 2") is near enough to be very re-
markable. It may be possible, by additional care and labour, to bring the solar inter-
polated curves nearer to the oþbservations, preserving the requisite conditions : but I
conceive that enough has been done to establish the general law.

I 4. On the Solar Inequality of the Time of High Water at Liverpool.

18. The solar inequality of the time must be found in exactly the same manner as
the solar inequality of the heights. By interpolation of Mr. LupBocx's Table XVI.,
I have obtained Declination Table (W.T.) ; and by comparing the time of high water
due to lunar declination by this Table with the observed times as given in column
(L. II.) of the calculations, I obtain the residual quantities in the columns (Diff. T.),
which should exhibit the solar correction of the times.
