Further if Z is written for (7—c), it follows from (9-13) that for large 7

Now two solutions of the equation

ae a =

dz 22 ag mt =0

are (Hartree 1935) exactly, not only asymptotically, a polynomial of degree n in z (in fact
the Hermite polynomial of order n and argument iz) and the n-fold integral of the error
function, with integration constants chosen so that this integral is zero at infinity, which is
of order e~7*/Z"*" for large Z. Since h,—+ is zero at infinity, it follows that if it is satisfied
(10-13) exactly, it would have this behaviour at infinity, but since terms of order ne”
have been omitted in equation (10-13) it follows that h, is of the same order.

This argument can be extended. It can be shown similarly that h/, and 7’ are at most of
order y?e~°"", where p is finite, whereas f, is at most of order 7; hence the only terms in
equations (8-25) remaining finite are those with ¢, as a factor, and these, on re-arranging,
become (starting with (8-25 ii))
