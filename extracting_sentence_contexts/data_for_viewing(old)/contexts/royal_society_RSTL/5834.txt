696 MR. J. LISTER ON THE EARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION:

vents the occurrence of post mortem. concentration, implying that the powers of the
chromatophorous cells are completely snspended by it within a few minutes at most of
its first acting on the part; yet, however long the tissues thus paralysed are kept, 8uh-
jected to its influence, they remain without any sign of action. © They will, however,
recover specdily and completely if s0on taken out and exposed to the air; 80 that the
irritating gas may be dissipated ; whereas if retained for several hours in the atrated
water, they may, indeed, have their powers restored to a certain extent on removal from
it, but exhibit only very feeble action, Such facts as these prove conclusively that, the
tisues may have their functional activity impaired without loss of vitality by the direct
action of irritants, independently of any stimulating effects which may be at first pro-
duced by them; and also that the influence thus exerted is of an injurious tendency, |

The imperceptible transition from suspension of function to loss of vitality displayed
by the long-continued' operation of carbonic acid upon the pigment-cells is also well
illustrated by some of the experiments upon the cilia, especially those with heat and
ammonia, which, unless employed with extreme caution, not only permanently arrested
the vibratile filaments, but reduced the epithelium-cells to a condition in which they
were amenable to the ordinary laws of chemical affinity. All irritants appear to be
agents which, if operating with sufficient energy, completely destroy vitality, probably
by inducing, through. chemical -or physical action, an irreparable derangement” of the
