Asynchronous electromechanical activity in the heart is known in the literature : =
as fibrillation. During fibrillation, the regular heart contraction is altered by fast re-entrant DR
waves (spiral or scroll waves) [1-4], which find a very critical substrate in the heterogeneous : a
and anisotropic structure of the cardiac tissue [5]. Spiral and scroll waves can in fact get [a
anchored (pinned) to localized heterogeneities, giving rise to abnormal high-frequency heart : 8
rhythms leading to the aforementioned arrhythmias. For this reason, if not followed by repinning, : S
unpinning is an important step towards successful termination of re-entries. Ne

In this scenario, one of the most challenging goals is controlling the complex dynamics of
the heart under conditions of fibrillation.
