Is a note on the action of chloride of methyl upon phosphide of calcium, communi-
Q cated more than ten years ago to the Institute of France *, M. PauL TnfxarD pointed out
© the existence of a series of bodies which correspond to the compounds of phosphorus
Z with hydrogen, which may, in fact, be viewed as hydrides of phosphorus, the hydrogen
S of which is replaced by an equivalent quantity of methyl.

5 One of these bodies, a liquid possessing a most offensive odour, spontaneously inflam-
Dmable and explosive in the highest degree, corresponds to the liquid phosphoretted
& hydrogen, and appears to occupy, in the phosphorus-series, the same position which
= belongs to kakodyle among the arsenic-compounds. It is a colourless, s0mewhat viscid
= liquid which boils at about 250? C. Exposed to the slow action of the atmosphere this
liquid is converted into a compound which is strongly acid and easily crystallizes.
-2 This acid is probably analogous to kakodylic acid.
5 In addition to this liquid body, two solid substances are formed by the action of
S chloride of methyl upon phosphide of calcium. One of these, according to M. PAUL
S Tafxarp, corresponds to the solid phosphoretted hydrogen, whilst the other, which is
