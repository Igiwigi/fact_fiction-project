J. M. HILL ON THE LOOUS OF SINGULAR POINTS

D [u, v]

In the case where ¢, ware each of the first degree in uw, v, then the theorem
requires to be specially interpreted, the interpretation corresponding to the fact that
if two straight lines have two points in common, they have an infinite number of
points in common. Hence, in this case, the two equations have an infinite number of
solutions in common. (This particular case is of great importance in Section IV. of
this investigation.)

(D.) To determine the conditions that the equations }(u, v) = 0, W(u, v) = 0, may
be satisfied by three coinciding systems of common values. In this case, considering as in (C) that u, v represent the coordinates of a point, the
curves (wu, v) = 0, W(u, v) = 0 must have contact of the second order.
