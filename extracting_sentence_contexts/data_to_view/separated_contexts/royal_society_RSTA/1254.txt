For r>0 we have, from
proposition 4.3, Q(r) =cyr* exp(c3r). We will show that (S;) of theorem 7.1 holds. In fact, it is
clear that f(u,p) < cirÂ® + 63(cyr* exp(c3r))? <mr for 0<u<r and |p| < Q(r) for r>0 sufficiently
small whatever the value of m. Also, it is clear that f(u,p) > c1 uk> cy RK > MR for R<u<R/y
and |p| < Q(R/y) for R sufficiently large whatever [a, b] is used and whatever the value of M. This
shows that there exists at least one positive solution.
