A. The values of A, when the compass is placed in the middle line of the ship, and when
the deviations have been observed with every care, are always 80 s8mall, that the values
which appear in the Tables may be considered rather as errors of adjustment and
observation than as real values. In fact it may be inferred that in all cases where the
compass is in the middle line of the ship, we may consider A as zero. It results from
this, and is important in practice, that we may safely take the mean of the compass
bearings of any object, on four or more equidistant compass courses, as the correct
magnetic bearing ; observing, however, that if we observe on four points only, and D be
large, these ought to be either the cardinal or the quadrantal points. Semacireular Deviation,
