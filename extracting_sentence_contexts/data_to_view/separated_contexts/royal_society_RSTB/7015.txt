Here the lateral vessel immediately below the scutal
valve forms the sheath of the attrahens muscle. Hence, by contracting this muscle, blood
will be injected into the gut parenchyma with very considerable force indeed. That the blood forced into the blood parenchyma does in fact pass right through it,
I take to be established on morphological evidence alone. The existence of the scutal valve
and the arrangements of its flap, show conclusively that blood must pass into the lateral
vessel. If blood passes into a vessel, except in the case of erectile tissue (see later, p. 125),
it is obvious that it must also have a way out.
