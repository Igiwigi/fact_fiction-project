The existence of negative modes in equation (3.18) is essential for the creation of particles from
vacuum, making norm conservation more akin to electric charge conservation (with positive and
negative charged particles) than to mass conservation in classical mechanics (with only positive
massive particles). The expectation value of the number of outgoing particles in the in-vacuum has a bosonic
thermal distribution, which is seen far from the horizon as a Planckian flux of outgoing particles

As in the astrophysical Hawking case—certainly as in the Unruh effect—in this generalized

derivation the emitted radiation is thermal and its effective temperature depends on the
acceleration of the moving medium [41], this is

This equation is the central piece of the general theory of Hawking radiation that can be applied
to any system: astrophysical or analogue. Despite the fact that the dispersionless case was
considered in this derivation, in analogue systems the presence of some kind of dispersion is
unavoidable, which usually leads to a change in the spectrum, the Hawking spectrum may
no longer be thermal. In the astrophysical case it is not clear if a dispersion mechanism exists,
but if space-time discretization were true, dispersion effects could be introduced into Hawking
radiation theory as in the analogue systems [42,43]. The most efficient way of solving the Bogoliubov transformations for several in- and out-
modes relies on the scattering matrix formalism.
