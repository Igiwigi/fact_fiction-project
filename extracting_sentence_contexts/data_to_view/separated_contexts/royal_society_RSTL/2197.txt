An ingenious friend, on peruſing theſe obſerva-
tions, aſked, * Whether the fact of evaporation going on
« equally well in an exhaaſted receiver, was not an un-
« ſarmountable objection to that theory concerning eva=-
« poration, which ſuppoſes a chemical ſolution of water
&« jn air?” With a view to aſcertain this fact I made the
following experiment. Two china faucers, each containing three ounces of
water, were accurately - weighed. / One: of them was |
placed in the open air; the-quickſfilver' in the thermo- '
meter ſtood during the experiment between 4.8? and 50*; ;
the day tolerably clear with a. moderate breeze,” The
other was put under the receiver of an air-pump;; the air
was exhauſted, and the piſtons occaſionally.
