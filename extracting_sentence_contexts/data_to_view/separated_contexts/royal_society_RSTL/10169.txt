T., 3), I now find to be uniformly characterised by the marked eccentricity of their
primordial chamber, and by the spiral direction of their early growth (fig. T., 2), which
I formerly supposed to be only occasional variations. In fact, the first formed portion
of these disks, like that of a young Orbiculina adunca (loc. cit., Plate XXVIIL, fig. 2),
exactly resembles what a Peneropline shell would be, if its chambers, as they
widen out, were to undergo division into chamberlets ; thus corresponding in every
