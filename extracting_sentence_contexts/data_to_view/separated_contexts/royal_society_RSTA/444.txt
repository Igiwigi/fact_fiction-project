AT NORMAL INCIDENCE

5-1. Scope of calculations

Calculations of the pressure on the strip have been carried out for representative points
up to time f = 3-1. By symmetry we need only calculate the pressures on half the strip, but
since any one diffraction wave G, is not symmetrical we must in fact calculate it over the
whole strip and points Y = 0-1, 0-3, 0-5, 0-7 and 0-9 were chosen for evaluation. The function Gy was tabulated from equation (85) and thence G, and G, were successively
evaluated from equation (86) using numerical integration. The values of these functions
are given in tables 1a, 1b, 2 and 3 where it may be noted that for Y>1 the values were
required for the numerical integration and thus had to be tabulated fully with the intervals
of 0-1 in Y and 0-2 in 7 adopted for this integration.
