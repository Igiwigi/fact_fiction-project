much similarity with the structure of Conostoma. The long-plumed micropylar tube
of Gnetopsis seems to be a very different feature, but we must remember that it is not
certain that there were no micropylar appendages connected to the stigma in Caytonia.

The male “ flowers * (A. Arberi) attributed to Gristhorpia may be usefully compared
with the microsporophylls known as Crossotheca. Both were constructed in a pinnate
manner with a narrow main stalk probably of foliar nature, but in the arrangement
of the anthers and pollen sacs there seems to be much difference. The form of
the pollen sacs was somewhat similar, but we know little of the structure of the
microsporangia in either case. It seems probable that whereas Crossotheca synangia
had two loculi, those of Caylonia probably had four.

So far as the available facts go, it is not impossible to regard the Caytoniales as
forms derived from a Pteridosperm complex, by the development of the closed, protecting,
carpel wall, either from a cupule-like structure of the type seen in Gnetopsis, or in a
manner to which the known Pteridosperms furnish no clue.

(b) Bennettitales—The possibility of a phyletic relationship between the Bennettitales
and the Angiosperms has been so widely discussed that it is desirable to ascertain
