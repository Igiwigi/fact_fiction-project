Now the number of plates being as one to four, and the
quantity of hydrogen nearly as one to two, we have the effects nearly as the
square roots of the number of plates. By increasing the number of plates to
a great extent, we should find, agreeably to a remark in Q 10 of Part First,
that the increase of effect would not go on 80 rapidly as the square root of the
number of plates. 'This fact, which follows from theory, is strikingly confirmed
by direct experiment. 17. The theoretical views now unfolded are strikingly confirmed by the
application of the torsion galyanometer in the following experiment.
