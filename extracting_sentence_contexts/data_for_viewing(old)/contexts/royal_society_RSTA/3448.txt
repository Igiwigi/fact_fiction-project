partitions can be ordered in some way, and the respective expanded systems then become

1 1 1 1 1 =
Ri | Riv | | Rw | c= Ry | Rav | | Rysor | c=

RU | Rav | | Raw | ¢=2 and | RF | Raw | | Riso | o=2

Remark 3.3. Although the number of the states (combinations of the values of the elements)
of the bunch R° in R’ and especially in R” is very large, the support of each bunch (the set of
the states with non-zero probabilities) has the same size as that of the initial random variable Ri
in R (i.e. in our example, it cannot exceed 5). This follows from the facts that each event Ri =x
uniquely defines the state of R° in R’ and in R”, and that }>, Pr [Rj =x] =1.

(b) Dichotomizations and canonical/split representations

Definition 3.4. A dichotomization of a set V is a function f : V > {0,1}. Applying such an f to
an rv R with the set of possible values V, we get a binary rv f(R). We call this f(R) a split of the
original R.

If Ri is an element of a system R, let us agree to identify f(Rj) as Diw: where W =f~1(1), with
the understanding that Df, and Diuv- w) are indistinguishable. To make the choice definitive, we
always choose W as the smaller of W and V — W; in case they have the same number of elements,
we order the elements of V, say 1 < 2 <--- <k, and then choose W as lexicographically preceding
