If a Cone, an Olive, or any shell whose last whorl almost completely enve-
lopes and protects the rest, and whose cavity is much compressed, allowing
only a small space for the conyolutions of the body of the animal, be slit down,
either from the apex to the front of the axis, or across the body yolution, at a
little distance before the suture, it will be observed that all the septa between
the different whorls are extremely thin and transparent ; and when these septa

: ginally composed, which plate will
be seen to agree in 8tructure with the inner one of the three. On tracing these
8epta to the outer whorl, it will be observed that every part of them, during the
various stages of growth of the shell, has been once a part of the outer whort;
and since we know from experience that the outer whorls of the young Olive
and young Cone are as thick in proportion to their 8ize as those of the adult,
there is little reason to doubt that each of these septa was originally formed
of three plates, in the same manner as the other parts of the shell. That this
was actually the case, and that the part remaining is the continuation of the
inner plate, the other two plates having been removed by absorption, may be
proved by the fact that the other two layers of the same yolutions are distinetly
visible on the exposed part of the spire, and on the front part near the pillar,
while they are deficient only on the thin part of the septa; and if the outer half
of the penultimate whorl, or rather the half-whorl just within the mouth, be
examined, the two outer layers will be found to be there only in part absorbed,
leaving a sbelving edge directed towards the cavity of the shell*,

A still stronger instance of the absorption of the septum may be obseryed in
the shells formed by some of those Mollusca whose respiration is effected by
means of lungs, as, for instance, the Auriculide. In the young shells of this
family the septa which separate the whorls are incomplete, and twine nearly
parallel to each other. As the shells increase in size, the Jater formed septa
become much more oblique and broader, and at length completely separate
the cavities of the whorls.
