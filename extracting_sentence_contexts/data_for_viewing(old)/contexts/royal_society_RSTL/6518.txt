processes. Now in the case of the large nerve-cells of the spinal cord, like those repre-
sented in fig. 12,  @, the thick cell-walls, as deyclopment adyances, form part of the
surrounding reticular tissue, with which the surface of the contained cells, till retaining
a thin investment. is in a similar way connected by processes. Sometimes there remains
around the stellate cell a more or less circular space enclosed by what seems to be the
inner surface of the original cell-wall, of which the outer portion has blended with the

surrounding tissue.

In the account thus given of the development of the spinal cord, I have carefully
refrained from indulging in any theoretical yiews, and have confined myself solely to a
faithful description of what was actually seen. A few remarks, however, are required
in further explanation of some of the obseryed facts, and in reference to the conclusions
that may be drawn from them.

We have seen that in its earliest stage of development, the spinal cord consists of a
canal surrounded only by one uniform or homogeneous layer of small cells or nuclei,
which are not distinguishable from each other in appearance, and are s0 closely aggre-
gated as to seem in actual contact. 'To call this single layer the epithelium of the cord,
appears to me about as incorrect as it would be to call the germinal membrane of the
oyum the mucous or internal of the two layers into which it immediately separates; for
in the second stage of its development, we find that this single and homogeneous layer
constituting the entire snbstance of the cord, while it continues to increase in depth,

* The connexion of nerye-cells with each other by means of prolongations of their sheaths is well seen
