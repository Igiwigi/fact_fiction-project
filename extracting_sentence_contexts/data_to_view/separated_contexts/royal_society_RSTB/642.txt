These observations
confirm the statements of JoserH,* whose experiments of division of the root between
the ganglion and the cord showed the existence of such fibres, and which, therefore,
must have their trophic centres elsewhere—in the cord. As in my experiments the
roots were divided on the distal side of the ganglia, if the trophic centres for these
fibres be situated in the spinal cord, the only way in which the explanation will hold
good is by supposing that such fibres are recurrent, as CLAUDE BerNarp has suggested,
and that they loop back in the plexus, at the junction of the motor and sensory roots.t
The only other way that the degeneration of these fibres can be explained is by

supposing that certain fibres derive their trophic supply in some way from the
periphery ; but I know of no facts that support any such supposition. VI. Summary AND CoNCLUSION.
