triangles and the theoretical calculation summarized by figure 1. Evidently, this is due to the fact
that the monoclinicity is small. The bent configuration is quite stable when the field is removed. This can be understood from
the fact that, due to the + invariance, fine arrays of 180° magnetic domains can be introduced into
each triangle, with 1/2 volume fraction + and 1/2 — so as to reduce the magnetostatic energy to
a low level when no applied field is present.
