It is therefor
rather more than halfway to the top of the hill, the slope of which is without, steep
escarpments, but with a terrace at the level of 150 feet (Plate XLI. fig. 2+). The work of exploration was completed in the swmmer of 1859, the cave having been
then emptied 80 far as it could be followed, although Mr. PExXGELLY observes ©
galleries certainly extend beyond the point reached .by the workmen.” It is probable
that the hill is in fact traversed by a number of such fissures. Respecting the manner in which the exploration was conducted, Mr. PENGELLY
remarks :—* It was decided first to remove the stalagmitic floor, then the entire bed imme-
diately below (if not of inconvenient depth) horizontally throughout the length of the
cavern, or 80 far as practicable; this accomplished, to proceed similarly with the next
lower bed, and 80 on until all the deposits had been removed.

* The more effectually to guard against the chance of error, the materials were first
carefully examined #7 situ, after which they were taken at once outside the cavern, where
they underwent a further inspection.
