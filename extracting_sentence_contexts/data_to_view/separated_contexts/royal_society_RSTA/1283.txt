2. Stylized facts

In this section, we lay out our dataset and empirically analyse transaction prices and trading
volumes of 15-min contracts.

We investigate high-frequency trade and linked fundamental data of all 96 15-min contracts
traded on the German continuous intraday power market at EPEX SPOT SE. Our observation
period spans from 1 January to 31 December 2015. The trade data of 15-min contracts involve
transaction prices and trading volumes from the continuous intraday trading session with a
1-min time resolution and are provided by [10].
