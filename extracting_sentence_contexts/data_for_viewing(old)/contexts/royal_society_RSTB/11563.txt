could not remember that she herself had been stuck with it.
While her brain was apparently able to form this association
between a neutral handshake and a painful consequence, her
brain was not able to voluntarily retrieve the event. The episodic
part of the memory had not been stored.

Clinical cases like these, substantiated by abundant scienti-
fic evidence (e.g. [51—54]), teach us that our mind is made up of
a constellation of agents that are, in principle, separable and
rely on semi-independent circuits. In cognitive psychology, a
classic distinction is made between ‘explicit’ or ‘declarative’
memory (what we can report, including episodic memory for
events and semantic memory for facts) and ‘implicit’ or ‘non-
declarative’ memory (including priming, reflexes and pro-
cedural memory such as aversive conditioning, motor skills
and habits) (for a review, see [55]). Declarative memory is
mostly subserved by the medial temporal lobe; most forms of
non-declarative memory are subserved by subcortical areas
such as the amygdala (aversive conditioning) and the stria-
tum (skills and habits) [55]. These memory systems can be
independently targeted [56-61] or damaged [62-65].

The idea that memory is composed of different systems is
not new, but has now been widely accepted [66,67]. Further-
more, work in both non-human animals and humans has
