A plant of #. globulus growing in a cool greenhouse, and free from outgrowths, was
removed to the stove, but developed no outgrowths. This was probably due to the


HISTOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON INTUMESCENCES, ETC. 237

fact that the leaves were old, as the plant was hardly growing at all when the
experiments were made. Outgrowths have been described by Soraver in E. globulus and E. rostrata. The
same observer has also noted the occurrence of outgrowths in E. Stuartiana,
E. coccifera, and E. saligna.
