they did not average more than the 400th part of a grain in weight. The
granules were thus unequiyocally proved to be of silex ; and as they were im-
bedded in, and diffused through, oxalate of lime, a substance of known urinary
origin, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion, that the production, or deposi-
tion of these two substances, went on simultaneously.

I am the more particular in mentioning the cireumstances under which the
siliceous deposit exhibited itself, because much discrimination is occasionally
necessary, on the part of medical men, to preyent their being deceived, by the
mistakes of patients, or their friends, in matters of an unusual nature. And as
if the love of exciting surprise and admiration by the marvellous, were not
confined to the traveller, there is sometimes found in patients, however sin-
gular the fact may appear, an inclination to impose on their professional
attendants, by the description or exhibition of \ s0mething strange and anov-
malousÂ®.

'There are only three instances on record, as far as I know, of the existence
of silex in urinary calculi. Two are mentioned by MM. Fourcroy and
VavQuELIN as occurring among 600 calculi which they analysed ; and here
the silex was found blended with oxalate of lime, as in the specimen which I
have mentioned. The third was observed by Prof. Wurzz, and its principal
ingredients were phosphate of lime and lithic acid, the weight of the calculus
being 870 grains, and the quantity of silex being one per cent. In none of
these calculi, however, is the magnitude of the siliceous particles stated.
