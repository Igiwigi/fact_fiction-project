On account of the continual appearance of young buds in
the angles between older ones, each of the latter is bordered by younger polyps on
each side. The latter gradually extend downwards, and finally meet behind the older
polyp which at the same time bends upwards, and thus becomes enclosed within the
disc. This is shown in fig. 188, where p‚Äù. and p!9. are already extending behind p},

As mentioned at p. 789, the ventral compartment of the polyp never has a calyx-
tooth, a fact which is rendered conspicuous when the polyps are retracted (see
fig. 189). When the polyp turns upwards and is enclosed in the disc, the ventral
chamber necessarily comes to be sitnated on the outer side of the polyp or away from
the centre of the group. By the union of the Jateral lines of buds the outline of the disc is completed at
front, and the marginal buds now form an nnbroken series from one side to the other
behind the axial polyp.
