The DP mixture of Gaussians is considered for model-
based clustering with different choices of the concentration parameter a. The box plots display variability in the estimates across
the 50 replicated datasets, with colour corresponding to a sample size of n = 100, 200 or 500. (a) Marginal mode of k. (6) MAP
clustering. (c) Binder clustering. (d) VI clustering. (Online version in colour.)

we, however, empirically observe a different behaviour when incorporating uncertainty on the
within cluster variance. In fact, the MAP clustering (figure 4b) contains only a single cluster in
almost all replicates and is robust to the choice of a. Again, the marginal posterior on k (figure 4a)
and the Binder clustering (figure 4c) are quite sensitive to the value of a, with the Binder clustering
extremely overestimating the number of clusters for larger n and w. The VI clustering (figure 4d)
contains only a single clustering in some replications, and in others contains two to four clusters,
particularly for larger sample sizes.
