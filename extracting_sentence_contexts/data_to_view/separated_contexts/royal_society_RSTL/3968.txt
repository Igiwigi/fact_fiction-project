Rock-salt and fluor-spar gave. evidence of the power in a slight
degree; and I think that a erystal of alum did the same, but its ray length in the
transparent part was 80 small that T could not ascertain the. fact decisively. Two
specimens of transparent fluor, lent me by Mr. Texxaxr, gave the effect.

2178. Rock-crystal, four inches across, gave no indications of action on the ray,
neither did smaller erystals, nor cubes about three-fourths of an inch in the side,
which were 80 cut as to.
