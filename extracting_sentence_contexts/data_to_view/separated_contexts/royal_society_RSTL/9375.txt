After examining my
specimens, he writes to me as follows : © I don't know what morphological evidence yol
may possess rendering it probable that the minute calcareous objects in limestone that
you showed me were originally siliceous animals or organisms ; bub T should require
8nch evidence to be overwhelmingly strong before I should accept such a conelusion,

I know of no agency by which siliceous structures could be converted into calcareous
ones, by mineralogical substitution, under the condition in which these organsms
exist, embedded'in a calcareous matrix. The fact that the silica was of animal origin does
not appear to me to render the possibility of s8uch a substibution more probable.” * l
have already shown that such morphological evidence as Professor SCHORLEMMER
demands is non-existant—hence I am impelled towards the conelusion that these
