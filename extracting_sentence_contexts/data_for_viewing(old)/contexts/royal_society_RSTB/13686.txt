Figure 3. In the trust game with incomplete information, nature (N) moves
first and determines the trustee’s type to be long-term or short-term with
probability a or (1— a), respectively. The probability a (as the entire
game) is common knowledge and the fact that the truster does not know
whether the trustee is long-term or short-term is denoted by the dashed
line. If the truster places trust, the long-term trustee honours trust while
a short-term trustee does not. In the first case, the truster receives payoff
R/(1 — 6); in the second case, the truster’s payoff is 5. The truster prefers pla-
cing trust if the trustee is a long-term type over not placing trust at all and is
most reluctant to trust a short-term trustee (i.e. R/(1 — d)) > P > 5).

uncertain about the trustworthiness of every new trustee
that attempts to interact with one of them.

A truster’s uncertainty about a trustee’s type can be
accounted for in the trust game with incomplete information
