which agrees well with expectation.

In the further breeding the 40 available groups (Table 35) obtained up to 1928 tested
for homogeneity and for compatibility with a 3:1 ratio, give P = 0-05 and 0-09
respectively, and add up to 364 A and 129 KEF, against an expectation of 370: 123.

This coincidence might, of course, be due to the presence of compensating ratios.
Some of the groups (e.g.,2 A, 4 K or 10 A, 0 K) are not very near 3: 1, anditesting
the six gen. 4 groups for homogeneity gives a P of only 0-04. A thorough
analysis of all the data (summed in Table 35) does not, however, show any
certain divergence from a 3:1 ratio, nor any clear differences between strains
or generations, and taking them as a whole the facts fit pretty well with the
theoretical segregation, though the possibility of there being some underlying
diversity, possibly a cytoplasmic effect, must be borne in mind.

* According as whether the broods from pairs are reckoned as one or two.


THE INHERITANCE OF SINISTRALITY IN LIMN#A PEREGRA. 125

Tf we assume that our interpretation of F broods (of which there are eight) is wrong
and reckon them with A rather than with K4, the fit with a 3:1 ratio is not so
good (e.g., in. gen. 3 we have 50 AF: 9 KE against 44:15), but it is still quite
credible. Some, too, of the A broods may be dextral break-throughs, which
