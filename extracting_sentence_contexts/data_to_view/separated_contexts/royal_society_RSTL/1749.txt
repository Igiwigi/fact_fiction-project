The form of the gan-
glion undergoes no alteration. From the analogy that exists in the distribu-
tion of this nerve to that of the eighth pair in the vertebrated animals, it is
probable that its functions are of a somewhat similar nature, â€”that in reality
it is the par vagum, or pneumogastric nerve of insects. In fact, this is the
pretty generally received opinion respecting it, and is clearly that of STraus
DuRCKnAE1M, who describes it in his Anatomy of the Melolontha vulgaris. It
must be confessed, however, that there are objections to such an opinion, since
it is not yet proved to distribute any filaments to the respiratory organs,
although it can hardly be doubted that such distribution does really exist,
when we remember the abundance of tracheal vessels which ramify upon the
stomach, and with which its filaments must necessarily come in contact. The
other nerves from the cerebral lobes arise nearer the lateral surfaces.
