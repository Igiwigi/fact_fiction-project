O. pendulum ;* it has also been seen in twelve species of Botrychium, by GREVILLIUS,T
but in varying abundance, and Kiun had previously described it for B. Lunaria.t
In Helminthostachys the fungus is present in the first three or four roots of the
young plant, but absent in the roots produced later.§ It is thus seen that mycorhiza
is not distributed with constancy in the family; in none of them does it take so
prominent a part in the nutrition as to lead to their discarding, or even in marked
degree reducing their dependence on the chlorophyll function. The facts will hardly
justify the use of the term “ saprophytic habit,” as applied to them collectively, since
the adult Helminthostachys is normally free from mycorhiza. But supposing that
they all showed mycorhiza, it does not follow that general reduction would be the
consequence ; a very large number of plants having mycorhiza show no sign of
reduction. Further, if reduction did take place, as has been pointed out in
connection with the Psilotacese, it would primarily affect the vegetative organs,
whose functions would thus be disturbed; but it would probably not alter the
sporangial conditions, except as a secondary consequence, in case the mycorhiza-
nutrition were less effective than the original autotrophic method.
