"Tur acriform compounds of hydrogen and carbon, which
were already entitled to accurate investigation, as objects
of scientific research, have derived an. additional claim to
the attention of the chemist, from their application to an
important economical purpose, described in a late commu-
nication to the Royal Society.* Yet there is, perhaps, no
part of chemistry, the investigation of which is beset with
greater difficulty, or with more numerous sources of error ;
insomuch, that the actual state of the science enables us to
attain, scarcely more than approximations to, the, truth, and
degrees of probability of greater or less amount. It was
the object of the experiments, which are described in. the fol-
lowing pages, rather to remove some of the obstacles, which
present themselves to a successful enquiry into the nature of
these bodies, than to acquire such facts, as may enable the
chemical philosopher to decide the controverted question re-
specting their composition. Results, sufficiently multiplied
