An advancement For instance, numerous transcriptomic, epigenetic and meta-
of EICA is the shifting defence hypothesis (SDH; [7,77]), which bolomic profiling studies have supported the correlations of
postulates that invaders may not reduce all herbivore defences these mechanisms with herbivory. In Arabidopsis thaliana,
in invasive populations, but there will be a shift from defences herbivory-induced changes in gene expression involved up-
against specialist towards those against generalist herbivores and downregulated genes in plant secondary metabolism net-
(driven by trade-offs between quantitative and qualitative works, hormone signalling pathways or plant defence-related
defences). In fact, metabolomic analyses have found some genes [102,103]. Changes in expression patterns of genes
invasive species to harbour more total secondary metabolites involved in plant defence against herbivory were observed
related to generalist herbivores, such as flavonoids or gluco- in Populus [104] and Solanum [105,106] and in the invasive
sinolates, in their introduced range than in their native range species Ambrosia artemisiifolia [54] and Solidago canadensis
(e.g. [59,81,91-94]). To add even more complexity, plant [56].
