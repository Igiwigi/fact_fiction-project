Its structure is composed
of corrugated layers and can again be described by assignment of non-bonding electron pairs
localized at the Bi atoms in agreement with the electronic structure characterized by an indirect
band gap and semimetallic properties. Under pressure, bismuth transforms stepwise into several
other structures and becomes metallic and superconducting, thus mimicking the behaviour of
tellurium. A puzzling fact created quite an excitement, namely that deposition of bismuth from
the gas phase on to a helium cooled substrate produced an amorphous 6K superconductor
which upon warming to 20K recrystallized with loss of superconductivity [20]. The case of
bismuth nicely illustrates the interaction of the metal atom matrix and the electronic system with
its delicate balance between pair localization and itinerancy. Both the metallic samples under
pressure as well as the randomness in the atom arrangement of the amorphous state obviously
hinder the localization of the electron pairs.
