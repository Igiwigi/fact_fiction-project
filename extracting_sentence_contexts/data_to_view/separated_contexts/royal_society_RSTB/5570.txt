renders this a probable explanation, and it is further supported by the fact that
various fungi are known to store reserve carbohydrates and utilise them later as
occasion demands, e.g., glycogen in yeast, trehalose in A. niger. A definite proof was obtained that kojic acid itself is produced from xylose, and is
really responsible for the colour reaction with this carbohydrate, by growing A. effusus
on 500 ¢.c. CzaPEK-Dox solution containing 5 per cent. of xylose.
