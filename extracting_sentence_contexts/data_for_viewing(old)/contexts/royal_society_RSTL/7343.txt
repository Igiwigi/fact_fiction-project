3216] of 'these in the P.T. all rest on -comparisons with ++ Urs in -8weeps 921 and

3224) 1001 (H.); and the obseryation of that star has been erroneous or mistaken in
8w. 921 by about 11' in P.D., as appears from an obs. of 73 Urse in the ame
8&weep. The nebule affected by this error are 'those here enumerated, and it
requires very careful consideration to disentangle all the observations of each
nebula by both-stars, and to decide on their identities. My final conclusions
are,â€”lst, that in these sweeps two distinct nebulze, IT. "794, 1 and II. 794, 2,
were observed, and confounded together under one number (=H.2079 register).
These are my h. 1406, 1407. 2ndly, that h. 1407 and TH. 778, 11. 795, 796
are correctly determined in '8w. 1001 (H.). 3rdly, that in swv. 921 (H.) the
nebula set down as IT. 794 was not the same [as that called TI. 794 in the
reduction of 8w. 1001; 7. e. that it was in fact h. 1406, and that im this obser-
vation there is also an error of 6' in P:D., or that, if not, there must be still
another nebula in P.D. 33% 54' (1860), Finally, that the place of III. 778
given in Phil. Tr., which is affected by the same general canse of error, requires
a correction of +9 in P.D.

3180 h. 1405=1IL. 44. This is the eompanion of M. 60, and is placed by M. D'Arrest
in the first class, even -with the 43-inch Leipzig refractor. Perhaps the very
superior light of M.-60 may have led both H. and h. to under-estimate that of
its, anyhow, much fainter companion. - .
