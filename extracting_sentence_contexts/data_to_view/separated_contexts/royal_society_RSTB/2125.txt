s That nucleo-proteid is present was determined in the following way: the cerebro-

2 & spinal fluid as each autopsy was performed was mixed with excess of alcohol, until

¢ at last over a litre of the fluid had been collected. The precipitated proteid was
collected, well washed with alcohol and with water, and then subjected to artificial
5 3 gastric digestion ; at the end of a week the undissolved residue was collected ; it was
2 found to have the solubilities of nuclein, and this was confirmed by the fact that it
a “@ contained a high percentage of phosphorus; this was done in the following way: the

2 residue was well washed with 0-2 per cent. hydrochloric acid to remove any still
aed inorganic phosphates; then heated for some hours on the water bath at

3 100° C. with fuming nitric acid, to which a small quantity of sulphuric acid was

s, “3 added, and an occasional pinch of potassium chlorate. *
