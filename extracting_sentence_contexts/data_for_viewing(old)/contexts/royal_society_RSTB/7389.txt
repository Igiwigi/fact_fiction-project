P. alpinum and Blindia acuta, are species with a northern distribution and considered to be of
alpine or arctic-alpine affinity ; both are restricted in Britain to-day to the extreme west and
to the north, where alone they are common. There is a possibility in both cases too that we
have either a variety, or a closely related species with an extreme northern distribution, and
which only occurs in Britain in a single highland locality. They are either species of bare
rock (Blindia), or often of open stony ground on mountain tops (Polytrichum alpinum), though
the latter occasionally occurs in more grassy places.

The three other species of terrestrial habitats were, in contrast, only found from the
uppermost muds—that is, towards the middle of the lower peat. These species, Climacium
dendroides, Antitrichia curtipendula and Plagiochila asplenioides, are all much more widespread
species than are Polytrichum alpinum or Blindia, and although reaching the Arctic Circle (in
Scandinavia) they cannot be said to be of northern distribution. In fact, Antitrichia may be
