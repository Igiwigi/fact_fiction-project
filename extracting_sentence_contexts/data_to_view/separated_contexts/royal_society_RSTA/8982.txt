If we except the low spot latitude group of
years, every case, whether of positive, negative or difference pulses makes the interval
from the primary to the third secondary pulse less than 81 days. Tn the case of the combined subsequent and previous pulses, the departures of the
primary crests from 0 are negligible, and it suffices to give the lengths calculated for
the intervals. The departures from 27 and from, 54 days are all very trifling, and in the case of the
19 years the departure from, 108 days is the least of any. he fact that the departure
from, 81 days has the same sign for the group of years of few sunspots as for the others
may appear inconsistent with what was said in discussing fig. 3. It is due to the relatively
low values of the characters for days 82 and 83 as compared with days 80 and 79
respectively. Taking single days, we get the crest at day 81, but taking a group of days,
whether 5 or 3, we get the crest decidedly on the down side of 81.
