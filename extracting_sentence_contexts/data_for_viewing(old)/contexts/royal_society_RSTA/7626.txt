with air, and

(ii) Correction for any relative changes in the dimensions of both étalons due to
temperature variations.

The value of the correction due to (i) can be obtained by means of a separate experi-
ment in which the distances between the semi-reflecting surfaces of A are optically
compared before and after filling it with air by measuring the separations of these
surfaces with reference to two fixed semi-transparent surfaces external to the étalon.
The effect of (ii) may be reduced to almost negligible proportions by using invar étalons
mounted inside a constant temperature enclosure.

A further temperature effect, due to the fact that the changes taking place in the air
when it is being admitted to étalon A may not be isothermal, can be guarded against by
reversing, in practice, the procedure which has been outlined above for convenience
in explanation, The experiment is started with étalon A filled with air under the desired
conditions of temperature, pressure and composition, the air having been admitted
several hours previously and the air-filled étalon allowed to attain the temperature
conditions of the surrounding enclosure. Etalon B being evacuated, the position of the
fringes with respect to the reference point is observed; then the air is withdrawn from A
as quickly as possible by connecting the étalon to a powerful vacuum pump, and the
position of the fringes for the condition when both étalons are evacuated is observed.
Although sudden expansion of air in the manner described is likely to be an adiabatic
process, so little time is allowed for the comparatively massive wall of the étalon to
be affected by the temperature changes in the air, which is being rapidly withdrawn
