to the uncertain and changeable contact potential difference. In fact, it is necessary
to find the position on the volt scale which corresponds to zero electric field between
the electrodes, either by a determination of the contact potential difference for some
particular case or by something which is equivalent to this. In principle the position
of the zero on the volt axis can be found from a study of photo-electric data. _Hxperi-
ments by the writer and Prof. K. T. Compron,* in which a structure similar to that used
in the preceding experiments was employed, namely, a small photo-electric source at
the centre of a large spherical electrode, have shown that the photo-electric characteristic
curves have the form shown in fig. 10. They consist of a flat part AB joined to a sloping
part such as AC or AD, whose slope diminishes with diminishing wave-length of the
monochromatic exciting light. The sloping portions all converge to a common point A
of the saturation part of the characteristic independently of the wave-length used.
A is the position of the true zero of potential difference, and, in fact, these small currents
are completely saturated in any accelerating electric field, however small. Thus one
method of locating the zero would be to find the convergence point A to the saturation
value of different monochromatic characteristics such as CA, DA. This would, of

and an examination of the preceding data will show that it is hopeless to attempt to
determine this point accurately under these conditions. For it is just as the currents
