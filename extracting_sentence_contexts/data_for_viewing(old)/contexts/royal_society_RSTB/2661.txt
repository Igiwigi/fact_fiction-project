the Stramberg Upper Jurassic Corals” (‘Paleont. Mitth.,’ Stuttgart, 1896). One of its most
interesting characters is the primitive nature of its modes of budding. The most usual is so-called
“tabular” and “endothecal” budding. Or an incomplete inner wall is frequently formed within the
calyx, and buds develop in the cut-off corners of the calyces. In other words an “edge-zone”’ is
formed within the calyx during periods of rapid vegetative budding. Again the contraction of the
calyx may give rise to one bud centrally; analogous contraction of the mother calyx may still be
observed in a recent Turbinolid, Schizocyathus,

a “main” septum; in Jurassic species it is as a matter of fact along septum. Yet
we see how it gradually becomes less developed, gives place in recent genera to
a pseudo-columella, or is rudimentary.

Family :—Stylinide, Kuz,

Colonial corals, massive, astreeiform, or incrusting.

Septa never pinnately inserted and no fossule present.

Septal symmetry always radial, septa alternating in length and developed
strictly in cycles (4 or 8, 5 or 10, 6 or 12 = primary cycle).
