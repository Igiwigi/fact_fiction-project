PROFESSOR Jamesox, in his chapter on the hydrography of India, justly remarks,
« Although India, like other great tracts of country, contains many springs, these
have hitherto attracted but little attention. 'The temperature of but few of them is
known ; their magnitudes and geognostical situations are scarcely ever mentioned ;
and their chemical composition, excepting in a very few instances, has been neglected.
The most important feature in the natural history of common or perennial springs,
namely their temperature, is rarely noticed, although a knowledge of this fact is illus-
trative, not only of the mean temperature of the climate, but also of the elevations of
the land above the level of the sea; and our information in regard to their chemical
nature is equally meagreF.” Since the publication of these remarks, much has
been done by Prixsey and others in these branches of Indian hydrography, but more
remains to be effected hefore this reproach can be wiped out. 'The heat of springs
having a temperature little above the mean of that of the surrounding country has
been rarely noticed, though I feel convinced many such exist in India. That of
springs of high temperature, more attractive to the casual observer, has been more
remarked.

My own observations, and the few inferences I have ventured to draw from some
of them, are not offered as sufficient data for the establishment of laws, bat merely
