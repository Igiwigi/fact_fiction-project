The integument is very thin and shining. The

Sciara

The literature on the Sciarinae is more extensive than that of any other sub-family
of the Mycetophilidae owing to the fact that all the Mycetophilidae which have any
economic importance belong to this sub-family. The larvae of many species have
been recorded as root pests on various potted plants, young wheat, orchids, peas,
lettuces, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Boucné. (1834) described the larva and pupa of Sciara vitripennis and three other
species of Sciara.
