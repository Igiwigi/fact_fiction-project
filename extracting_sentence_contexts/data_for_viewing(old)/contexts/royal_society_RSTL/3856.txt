tarsus is often deficient in the number of its joints; and the subsidiary parts of the
limb, the articular spines, are almost always absent. This is more especially the case
when a limb has been divided in the femoral or tibial joints, and the reproduction of
the limb has, in consequence, been only partial. But in all of these cases the terminal
part of the organ, the claw, is invariably reproduced. This was strikingly shown in
some specimens of partial reproduction, in which the claw was formed at the ex
tremity of a metaitarsal joint, or when one or more of the tarsal joints were wanting.

It is thus sufficiently clear that a power of reproduction of lost parts is common to'
the whole of the Insecta and Myriapoda ; and-that-it may take place in insects that
undergo a complete metamorphosis, as well as in;those-which do not change their form.
It yet remains to be shown in what'way this regeneration of-parts takes place. The
fact that it commences in insects and Myriapoda in any. portion of an organ that may
be wounded, or that it may occur, as in Spirostreptus and other Tulide, where the
entire organ with its basal portion has been removed, seems to lead: to the inference
that it is not confined to special parts, but exists equally in the whole of the organized
tissues,

The general conclusions to which I have been led by these investigations are,â€”-
First, that slight wounds of the body in larva are always healed, except when there
is any protrusion of the viscera, or, as in the higher Vertebrata, when hazmorrhage
