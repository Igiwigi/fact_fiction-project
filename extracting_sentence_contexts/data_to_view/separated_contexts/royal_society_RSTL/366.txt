STEPHEN HARR1s, to permit a female of his to be covered; the
same which had, in 179, rejected the attempts of the male to
cover her contrary to her inclination. Another messenger
was dispatched to Cudwah, for the Rajah's elephant, which was

the ability, as well as the inclination of the elephant, to propa-
gate his species in a domestic state, and that without any signs
of modesty, and having ascertained the period of gestation to
be twenty months and eighteen days, it may be necessary to
observe, that it is a difficult matter to bring a male, which has
been taken about the prime of life, into good condition to act
as a stallion; for, being naturally bolder, and of a more ungo-
vernable disposition, than the female, he is not in general
easily tamed, till reduced very low; and it requires consi-
derable time, as well as much expence and attention, before he
can be brought into such high order as is requisite, He must
also be of a gentle temper, and disposed to put confidence in
his keeper: for he will not readily have connexion with a
female, whilst under the influence of fear or distrust. Of this I
have 8een many instances; nor do I recollect one male elephant
in ten, which had been taken after having attained his full
growth, much disposed to have connexion with a female.
