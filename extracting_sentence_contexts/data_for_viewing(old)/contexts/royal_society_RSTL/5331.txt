one egg had become segmented, but that the yelks of the others were flattened,
shrivelled, and irregular, as if they had been affected by the solution of potass, or by
decomposing seminal fluid. On the seventh day the egg which had been segmented
had produced an embryo.

From these results, then, it appears that while the spermatozoon at a mean tem-
perature of the atmosphere of 55* FanR. usually loses its vitality, and is inert in less
than four hours, and but rarely is efficient at a longer period after immersion in
water, the egg retains its reproductive property for a very much longer time, especially
if not removed from the body of the dead animal, only losing it at twenty-four hours
after the death of the parent, and occasionally retaining it for forty hours.

The experiment No. 4, in which the latter fact is shown, is interesting, from the
cireumstance that the same results are produced by the living vibratile spermatozoon
on the yelks of the dead eggs, as the majority of these were, as that which is occa-
Sioned by the application of dead and decomposing spermatozoa to the envelopes of
the living one, as shown in No. 6 of the preceding set ; and further, that these results
80 closely resemble in appearance the first effects produced on the yelks of living eggs
by the application of strong solution of potass ; thereby showing not only that powerful
endosmic action takes place rapidly through the coverings of the egg, but also that
the influence of the spermatozoon on the yelk, whatever may be its precise nature,
is direct and immediate.
