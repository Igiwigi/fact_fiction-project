The support of the needle was turned round 90, which therefore removed
the plane in which the needle could move 90* from the magnetic meridian. This
carried the plane of no action on the needle 90? round, s0 that it now coincided with
the magnetic meridian ; and the plane, which, standing east and west, was before
neutral, was no longer a plane of indifference, but in fact passed at the middle of the
segments through the places of strongest action.

2990. Here, with inclination, as before with declination, it is not the direction in
which the needle stands that determines what action the helix may have upon it ;
for it may be loaded or otherwise restrained, as all horizontal needles are ; but it is
the direction of the lines of force at the needle which, with the helix, governs all. The helix may be above or below the prolongation of the needle indifferently ; for if
it still continues on the same side of the line of force, under the influence of which
the needle acts, then the end of the needle moves in the same direction, though it
may travel towards the helix in one instance and from it in another.
