In the longitudinal section (fig. 14) the cells
of the medulla are seen to be of irregular shapes and sizes, but often narrow, elongated
longitudinally, and square-ended. The vessels of the surrounding cylinder are generally of
large size, ranging from *007 to -005 in diameter, and with strong, sharply defined walls;
but at the inner and outer boundaries of the cylinder we have many small ones, not
exceeding 002, resembling, in this respect, some vessels which are scattered through
the medullary parenchyma. On examining the longitudinal section (fig. 14) of this
axial cylinder, we find that the vessels are of the usual barred type, and that the largest
of them occupy the central parts of each clusterâ€”a fact als shown by fig. 13. But
the most remarkable feature of these vessels is further illustrated by figs. 15 & 16. In
fig. 15 the dark, strongly marked walls of the vessels enclose densely packed masses of
cells (7).
