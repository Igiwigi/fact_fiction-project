ampere to 5 x 107° ampere, 7.e., in a ratio of 1 to 20,000. At the same time the gas
evolved from the walls only sent up the pressure to 0°001 millim. This curious and
interesting effect, which is being further investigated, does not appear to depend on
the state of cleanliness of the tube, as it showed itself with apparently undiminished
vigour after the tube had been taken down and boiled out three times with pure
nitric acid and subsequently rinsed out seven times with boiling distilled water. The
effect was also obtained in air at atmospheric pressure and in a vacuum produced by
liquid air and charcoal, where it was impossible for the wire to come in contact with
mercury vapour or vapours given out by phosphorus pentoxide.

Whatever the cause of this effect may turn out to be, it is clear that it might have
completely vitiated the present measurements of the leak in oxygen and other gases.
Tn fact, the following considerations will show that a small trace of the above effect
might easily simulate the effects investigated. When the gas pressure is very low,

very little heat is carried from the hot wire to the surrounding electrode and the
walls of the tube, which consequently remain quite cold. As soon, however, as the
pressure of the gas is increased the temperature of the walls increases too, and if the
above effect were coming into play, the increase in the leak due to the heating of the
walls might easily appear to be a steady function of the pressure of the gas in the
