The cells are very thin-walled, and are usually clear and almost colourless. They
occasionally contain one or two dark round spots which Prof. Sewarp has suggested*
may represent mineralised nuclei, but the fact that cells often contain two or three
of these dark bodies indicates that this hypothesis cannot be upheld. It is probably
safer to regard them as the remains of cell-contents. In other cases some cells
may have a deep brown colour, while they may often be partly or wholly filled with
a mass of small round granules (Plate 4, figs. 6, 10), which seem to be connected
only with the conditions of preservation, and probably have no important significance,
for they occur very largely in badly preserved specimens.
