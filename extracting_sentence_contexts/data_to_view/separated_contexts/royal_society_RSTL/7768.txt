1. The applications of the Microscope in the investigation of Meteorites. Tut mineralogical investigation of a meteoric stone presents difficulties yery similar to
those which have hitherto rendered the analyses and descriptions of many of the finer-
grained terrestrial rocks unsatisfactory ; for a meteoric stone is in fact a fragment of a
rock, though formed under conditions in some respects widely differing from those which
have produced the rocks of our globe. The difficulties alluded to arise from the minute size and imperfectly developed crys-
tallisation of the mineral constituents alike of the rock and the a&rolite; and they have
in general baffled the efforts of the chemist on the one hand to effect their separate
analyses, and of the crystallographer on the other hand to determine the forms of these
constituents. The chemist indeed has endeayoured to overcome the difficulty by attempt-
ing a chemical separation of the constituent minerals of these fine-grained mixtures into
one group of such as are soluble and another group of those which are insoluble in acids,
and then treating the numbers obtained from the analyses of these groups by the light
of theoretical considerations founded on the formulze and properties of known minerals.
