Additional considerations

(a) Asymptotic opinion distributions

The two-against-one model produces mf% = sgn(m)y-), hence, independently of the polarization
switch, only three values are possible for the asymptotic mean opinion: mj =—1, 0, 1. In
particular, we observe that my; =0 arises only if mvc =0 and that the latter is an unstable
equilibrium of the product moment myc, cf. (3.5). As a matter of fact, the relevant physically
observable cases are therefore mj; = +1, which identify a consensus in the social network with
asymptotic opinion distribution
h*(w) = 8(w + 1). Conversely, the Ochrombel-type simplification produces my = mc /mc € [-1, 1], which need

not imply an asymptotic consensus because mj; may be in principle any value in the interval
[-1, 1]. A simple computation shows that the asymptotic variance owe of the opinion is

O )2
2,00 (myc)
ow =l- ee
mo

and that the asymptotic opinion distribution is in this case

0 0
h®(w) = ; (: + the) 3(w—1)+ ; (: - he) 8(w +1). (4.1)

mc


All in all, the Ochrombel-type simplification produces a less sharp, thus probably more realistic,
big picture of the possible asymptotic scenarios on the social network while retaining all the
essential features characterizing the polarization switch.

(b) Statistical independence

An intriguing simplification of the dynamics studied in §3 is obtained by assuming statistical
independence of the variables W;, C, meaning that

f(w,c, t) = g(c)h(w, t) Vt>0. (4.2)

Plugging this ansatz into (2.8) and choosing the observable quantity of the form ¢(w,c) =
¢(w)W(c) for arbitrary functions g : {—1, 1} > R and y:R, > R, we obtain that the Boltzmann-
type equation of the two-against-one model reduces to

Be) +H o-Y = Emep(ngty (HO — 4) (eC) - e-1)).
