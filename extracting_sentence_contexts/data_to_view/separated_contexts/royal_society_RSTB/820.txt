S The cause of this diminished inflow into the ventricles, leading to corresponding

& diminution of the output is twofold, namely weakening, or arrest of the auricles, and,

a secondly, the elastic resistance of the ventricular wall to distension. We show that

= this explanation must apply to both sides of the heart and that observed facts

£ correspond with it. :

= We then consider the after-effects of vagus excitation, and show that the temporary

‘3 increase in the output which is sometimes present may be explained by a temporary

f: increase in the force of the auricular contractions, and by the venous pressure taking

= some little time to fall after the vagus excitation has ceased. (Pp. 227-231.)
