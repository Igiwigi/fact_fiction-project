atmosphere 69*8 Faur., I placed a single specimen of B. Jonella immediately after it
was captured in the stoppered phial employed in the previous experiments. The phial
was closed, and the insect continued in a highly excited state for six or eight minutes.
When it had become quiet a thermometer was very carefully introduced to the bottom
of the phial without touching the insect, and the mercury rose to, and was main-
tained at 74%7, or 58. above that of the atmosphere and of the phial at the com-

mencement of the observations. The insect then became excited, and the thermo-
meter was held near enough to touch the tips of its wings. The temperature of the
air in the phial immediately sunk to 72%5, being a diminution of 2'2. This observa-
tion was several times repeated with the same results, 80 that while confirming the
previous conclusion respecting the eyolution of heat, it 8hows also another interesting
fact, viz, that the vibration of the wings tends to cool the body of the insect during

flight, and moderate its temperature. But the power of radiating from its body into
the surrounding atmosphere is not confined to the insect in its perfect state only, but
exists also in the larva, as I have had opportunities of observing in the laryz of the
Sphinges, Puss Moth, &. From these observations it is clear that a very large pro-
portion of the heat eyolved by insects in all their states passes off into the surrounding
medium, and that the amount of heat evolyed is in proportion to the degree of excite-
ment and consequent quantity of respiration.
