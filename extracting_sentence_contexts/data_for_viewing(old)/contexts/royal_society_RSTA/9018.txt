62 PROF. J. JOLY ON THE GENESIS OF PLEOCHROIC HALOES.

attempt applied to this last faint halo, using a Leitz No. 4, gave 24:70 as the ratio
of width of band to radius. This nearly agrees with 6:18 as above. The external
radius of this halo was measured as 00151, and the internal radius as 0°0104. These
dimensions are subject to a small correction for the nucleus, which would leave the
final readings as closely 0°0147 and 0:0100 ; and the mean radius becomes 0°0123. In
the same flake of Carlow mica and near the last halo a sharp but faintly coloured ring was
investigated in the same manner ; the results were almost identical. Referring to the
Table above we get (r—7,)/r = 5/19 nearly. The tabulated mean radius is 0°01235.

These minute haloes abound in the Carlow mica. In fact in places the clear mica
is dusted over, as it were, with the black nuclear specks around which these haloes
are formed, the delicate rings interlacing and overlapping in actual confusion.
Some are, as already stated, so faint as to be hardly detectable. Others are well
defined discs, the earliest formed part of the halo appearing as a darker border to
the disc. One or two such growths are seen in the photographs already referred to.
A vain endeavour was made to photograph the finer haloes but although many
exposures and various combinations of lenses were tried nothing of value was obtained.
The drawing (Plate 1, fig. 1) to a magnification of 800 is as realistic as I can make it.

A small correction has to be applied to these haloes for the effect of the nucleus in
enlarging the radius. 1 have taken this as amounting to one-half the radius of the
nucleus. ‘This correction has been applied to the figures tabulated for 7, and. The
