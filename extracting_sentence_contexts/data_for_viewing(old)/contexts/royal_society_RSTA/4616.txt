much [121]. But observations and models have greatly improved, palaeoclimate has given us

a substantially improved view of what has and could happen, we know how to model many
processes more realistically, and we have a better understanding of the robust results and key
uncertainties. Charney based his conclusions on essentially two GCMs, citing five sources, of

which a single one was actually published [122], the other sources were in press, submitted or

labelled as personal communication. The published model by Manabe dates back to 1969 and has

a limited computational domain with equal areas of land and ocean, an idealized topography, no

heat transport by ocean currents and fixed cloudiness. Thus, the fact that the range for climate
sensitivity today is similar as was guessed by Charney over three decades ago based on sketchy
evidence should not be interpreted as a lack of progress, and using the range of ECS as a measure

of success for climate research fails to characterize the state of research.

(c) Possible ways forward

There are ‘top-down methods’, in which a global feedback is inferred from a global energy balance
equation, and ‘bottom-up methods’, in which the total feedback is an emerging property of the
myriad processes that we try to model quantitatively based on insight into each process and data
obtained to constrain or parametrize it. There are, of course, methods in between that combine
elements. All methods have in common that they are a fusion of models and observations, and
