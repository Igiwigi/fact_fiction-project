It is well documented that eIPSCs control the timing of
neuronal firing with incoming activity [14,15], which is not
only critical for proper information processing, but also for
spike-timing dependent plasticity mechanisms [16]. While
both eIPSCs and mIPSCs could affect neuronal responses
via shunting, the potential function of action potential-
independent mIPSCs themselves has remained largely
speculative. It has been long recognized that the frequency of
mIPSCs is normally very high across many brain regions
[17,18] despite the fact that the density of inhibitory synapses
is orders of magnitude less than that of excitatory synapses
[19]. This observation has raised speculations that inhibitory
‘noise’ may serve a function [18]. In this study, we report that
in adults visual experience specifically regulates inhibitory
‘noise’ (mIPSCs) without changing eIPSCs. In particular,
visual experience reversibly regulates the frequency of
mIPSCs, which is the only functional change in inhibitory
synaptic transmission reported so far in adults during an age
range previously referred to as the refractory period for plas-
ticity [20]. Furthermore, we also found that non-genomic
actions of oestrogen specifically alter mIPSC frequency in
adult visual cortex, which suggests that this mechanism is a
