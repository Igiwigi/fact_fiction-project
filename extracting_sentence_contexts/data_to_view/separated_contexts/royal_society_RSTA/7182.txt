where primes denote differentiation with respect to v. It can be readily verified that the
foregoing expressions for L,, L;, L, and Ly satisfy Batchelor’s differential equations (113). Indeed, the appearance of two arbitrary functions of in the solution (115) is in agreement
with the fact that two differential equations govern four functions.

8. THE DYNAMICAL EQUATIONS

From the equations of motion we derive in the usual fashion that the equation governing
the rate of change of Q;; is (cf. von Karman & Howarth 1938; and Batchelor 1946)

In (117), the primes and the lack of primes distinguish the values of the quantities taken at
x; and x;, respectively; also p denotes the density and / the pressure. We shall return to a detailed consideration of §;; in §10, but it is evident, meantime, that
since both Q;; and V?Q,, are symmetrical in their indices and solenoidal, the tensor S,; must
also be symmetrical in its indices and solenoidal.
