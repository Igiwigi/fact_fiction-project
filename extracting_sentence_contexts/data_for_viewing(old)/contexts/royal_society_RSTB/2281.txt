surroundings, in short, to become adapted with relatively slight transfiguration and
dislocation. The pieces of the same individual cell can be traced, however far they
may extend, by the physiological methods mentioned. A limitation to the use of the
nerve-fibres as guides to the territorial extent of segments, though hardly to their
indication of the broad position of segments is, however, placed by their habit—as it
appears to be—of somewhat overstepping, in their ultimate growth, the actual limits
of the parent metamere. This overstepping is not in the skeletal muscles and in the
sensory structures of the skin greater than to include a half, or generally rather less,
of the adjacent segment, and it is regular in figure and extent. It certainly does not
seriously confuse the picture that it affords, of the general segmental plan of a part.

I have now to attempt an exposition of the general scheme of arrangement I
believe evidenced by the facts detailed in the preceding sections. Before proceeding
to such generalisation, it is well to obtain, however, some answer to the following
questions :—Is the amount of overlapping of the skin-areas of the various spinal
nerves equally great in all body-regions? Is the amount of overlapping of the
various spinal nerves greater or less than that of the territories of peripheral nerve-
trunks? Is the amount of overlapping of the distribution of the sensory spinal-roots
in skin equalled by that of the distribution of the motor spinal roots in muscles ?
What functional significance can be attached to the overlapping ?

Is the amount of overlapping of the skin-fields of adjacent dorsal (sensory) spinal
roots equally great in all body regions? In my previous paper I stated that “I con-
clude that the anterior and posterior overlaps are extensive enough in the Monkey to
provide that the skin taken along any line parallel with the plane of the segmentation
