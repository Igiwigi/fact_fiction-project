At the stage of division shown in fig. 12, this change has already taken place.
Probably the collateral structure was assumed lower down, for it is found in bundles
which are still in the cortex of the stem, as distinguished from that of the leaf-bases.
This is beautifully shown, for example, in the pair of bundles (probably arising from
the division of a single one) represented in transverse section, Plate 7, photograph 14.
These bundles, with many others like them, lie well within the internal sclerenchyma

. (see Plate 6, photograph 5, v.b. The phloem is excellently preserved, and is evidently
limited to the outer side of the xylem. The smallest xylem-elements are adjacent to
the phloem, and in fact the structure is in all respects that of the well-known
“exarch” vascular bundles of Myeloxylon.

Photograph 15, showing a similar pair, is taken from a more external part of the
cortex, lying within the triangular space indicated in Plate 10, fig. 2, between the
hypoderma, o.c. and the internal sclerenchyma sc. This space, as proved by the
comparison of successive transverse sections, represents the base of a leaf, which at a
higher level begins to become free from the stem (photograph 2, Pet.).

We see, then, that the structure characteristic of the vascular bundles of the petiole
is already assumed, not only in the leaf-base, but within the cortex of the stem.

As shown by the longitudinal sections (Plate 12, fig. 15), the collateral strands,
