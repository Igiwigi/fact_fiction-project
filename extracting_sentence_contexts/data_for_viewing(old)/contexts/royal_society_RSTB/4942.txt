Cubic Feet per Hour per 50 Eggs.


DR. A. P. CHATTOCK ON THE PHYSICS OF INCUBATION. 433

Lamson and Epmonp found, moreover, than when air was pumped through their
experimental incubator at the rate of 5 cubic feet per hour per 50 eggs, the density of
the CO, present was the same as that in their hen nests. There should, therefore,
have been agreement between this 5 cubic feet and the 3-2 cubic feet just obtained.

The accuracy with which each of these figures represents the ventilation for which
it was calculated is higher than the difference between them suggests ; but, apart from
the fact that the determinations were upon such different lines, the nests were not the
same in the two cases, and this probably affords sufficient explanation of the discrepancy.
The important point is that both numbers fall satisfactorily within the region of highest
hatching efficiency.

The “tin” nest data also admit of a comparison between that part of the loss of
weight of incubating eggs due to loss of carbon with that due to loss of water.

The number of grammes of carbon lost per egg in 20 days = 1-8 x 23* x 0-8 x 1-98
x 10-7 x 1,000 x 0-273 x 24 x 20 = 0°87.

The grammes of water lost in the same time = 4:83 20/13 — 0-87 = 6-6. Carbon
thus constitutes 12 per cent. and water 88 per cent. of the total loss of weight of
