While the upper
series in both coalfields is very similar lithologically, this is not the case as regards
the lower series, which in Coalbrookdale appear to be a grey series, far richer in coal,
and particularly in ironstone, than the red-grey Sweet Coal series of the Wyre
Forest. In Coalbrookdale the coals of the lower series vary from 7 to 22,
distributed throughout the series, while in the Wyre Forest the Sweet Coals
number from 8 to 7 (counting very thin seams), most of which I believe to lie
all together near the top of the series (see pp. 372 and 373). The explanation of this difference between the lower series in the two areas is to
be sought in the fact that, although the Wyre Forest and Coalbrookdale apparently
form one coalfield, this is not in reality the case. The whole area includes at least
Sour coalfields of different ages, some of them in part, but only in part, overlying or
overlapping one another, This I believe to be the key to the structure of this area. In the whole of the Southern part of Coalbrookdale the lower series (Middle Coal
Measures) are absent.* We have thus two isolated regions of Middle Coal Measures
or Sweet Coal Series, one in the Northern part of Coalbrookdale and the other in the
Northern, Eastern, and Central districts of the Wyre Forest.
