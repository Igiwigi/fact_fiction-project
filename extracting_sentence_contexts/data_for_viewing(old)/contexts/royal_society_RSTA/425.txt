up the minority-spin band-gap while preserving, correctly, the metallic character of the majority
spins (figure 2).

Many practitioners regard the strength of the Hubbard-U term as a parameter of the
simulation, and DFT + U has often been used incorrectly as a method for widening the band
gap for general semiconductors. Empirically fixing the band gap for closed-shell systems usually
requires an unphysically large Hubbard U, causing overlocalization and a flattening of the
valence and conduction bands. In this sense, it might be thought that DFT + U calculations are
semi-empirical, rather than ab initio in nature; however, Cococcioni & de Gironcoli [31] showed
that the correct value of the Hubbard-U terms could in fact be computed using density functional
perturbation theory. This technique removes the empiricism and ensures that the values used
are physically reasonable, though it is not straightforward to apply to materials with many
different elements.

The final approach we discuss is Hartree-Fock and related methods. In the Hartree-Fock (HF)
method, the non-local Fock (exact) exchange energy is not a density functional but depends
on the single-particle states. This exchange exactly cancels the spurious self-interaction, but
takes no account of electronic correlation. The exchange itself is very long ranged, decaying
only as 1/r, and is not screened leading to unrealistically high excitation energies and a large
overestimation of the band gap. A hybrid XC functional is a combination of HF and LDA (or
GGA) functionals, motivated by the observation that HF overestimates the fundamental gap and
LDA or GGA functionals underestimate it. These hybrid functionals yield a result intermediate
