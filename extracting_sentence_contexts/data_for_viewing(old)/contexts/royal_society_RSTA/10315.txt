unites these rays, and there is strong evidence that they should be grouped together.
The correspondence of the other lines is more doubtful. Taking account of the dis-
placements due to differences of atomic weight, it seems possible that the mercury
line at 3650Â°31, which is strong in the arc, is the line corresponding to the above
in the mereury spectrum,

Mercury,

The attempts which have been made to obtain the flame spectrum of mercury have
been unsuccessful. No lines of mercury have been seen in the flame into which has
been blown the spray from solutions of metallic mercury in nitric acid, and from
aqueous solutions of mercuric chloride to which sodium chloride has been added.
M. Govy has elsewhere stated the same fact.

It may be of interest to note that no mercury lines are present in the solar
spectrum.
