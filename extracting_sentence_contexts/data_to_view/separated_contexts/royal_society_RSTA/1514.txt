Thus the 13 galvanometric readings with
a glass prism, and 6 readings with a quartz prism, in the infra-red spectrometer, gave
the following differences between the observed and calculated rotations :—

Casual errors + moe = + 0-012°/mm. Systematic error .. mous = — 0:0005°/mm. More important is the fact that, in the region of maximum sensitiveness, four readings
with the glass prism showed a casual error of -+ 0-001°/mm. and a systematic error of
+ 0-001°/mm. at wave-lengths ranging from 16,600 to 18,600 A.U., whilst four similar
readings with the quartz prism showed a casual error of + 0-005°/mm., and a systematic
error of — 0-002°/mm.
