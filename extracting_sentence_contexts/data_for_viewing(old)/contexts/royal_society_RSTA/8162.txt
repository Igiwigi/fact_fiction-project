is peculiar. The particles at the outer edges of each ridge, where the ridge is only a
particle or two high, move along from ridge to ridge and finally a very small ridge is
formed near the node which, partaking of the general motion of the ridges, moves
slightly towards the node and then collapses on the floor of the tube. Successive
small ridges are so formed, move towards the node, and collapse at the same place,
building up a thick line of dust near the node, but not at the node—an important point.
In this process the central ridges gradually become entirely depleted of dust so that
two systems are formed, as shown in fig. 30, Plate 24, which depicts conditions while
the clearance is in progress. The process continues, the last ridge on the antinodal
side being robbed of its dust from the edges and vanishing, to leave its neighbour as
the last ridge, which vanishes in its turn, until all the dust has passed into a single
wall near the nodes, which, in consequence of the large amount of dust deposited, and
of the fact that it is mainly deposited as short ridges, has a heap of dust in the middle,
as shown in fig. 31, Plate 24.

This wall should be regarded as a ridge deposited at a position where the amplitude
just ceases to be sufficient to maintain a ridge. Further explanation is given in
Section 7. Two of these lines, one on either side of the node, as shown in fig. 31, Plate 24,
form one of the eyes described by Kunpt. If the vibration is very vigorous the two
lines are formed so close together that they coalesce as one broad line at the node.
This is Kunpr’s observation for light powder when the tube length was such that a
node was formed near the driving disc.

Slight modifications of the phenomena depend on the amount of dust present. If
there is plenty of dust the ridges are high and present a peculiar wavy appearance
