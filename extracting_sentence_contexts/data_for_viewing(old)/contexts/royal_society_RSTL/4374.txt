Of the degree 5; three covariants,
one of the order 1 (a linear covariant).

And these covariants are connected by a single syzygy of the degree 5 and of the
order 11; in fact, the table shows that there are only two asyzygetic covariants of
this degree and order ; but we may, with the above-mentioned irreducible covariants
of the degrees 1, 2, 3 and 4, form three covariants of the degree 5 and the order 11;
there is therefore a syzygy of this degree and order.

40. I represent the number of ways in which q can be made up as a sum of m terms
with the elements 0, 1, 2,...m, each element being repeatable an indefinite number

of times by the notation
' P(0, 1,2,..m)*%q,
and I write for shortness

P(0,1,2,..m)%g=P(0, 1,2..m)%g—P(0, 1,2...m)%q—1.
