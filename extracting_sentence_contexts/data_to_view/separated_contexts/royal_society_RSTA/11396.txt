W. RICHARDSON ON THE IONISATION

about nine-tenths of the hydrogen originally present in it at the end of the
experiment, so that the experiment appears to warrant the conclusion that the
amount of the negative ionisation depends very little on the amount of hydrogen in
the wire. In fact, the hydrogen appears to act by altering the condition of the
surface of the wire, and once this change has taken place it is very little affected by
changes in the amount of hydrogen either outside or inside. The most reasonable
view appears to be to suppose that the positively charged hydrogen atoms form an
electrical double layer, which helps the corpuscles out of the metal. A few measurements of the variations of the ionisation, both positive and negative,
with the temperature were made in hydrogen.
