HISTOLOGY OF THE CELL WALL. 95

appears to consist of threads which are finer and more numerous than the longer
ones which traverse the thicker portion of the membrane. The portion of the wall
traversed by the shorter threads stains faintly, while the wall through which the
longer segments of the threads go remains uncoloured, and is bright and highly
refractive, so that the difference between the two sides is the more emphasised. This
portion indeed appears somewhat of the nature of a callus, though observations show
that it does not answer to the usual callus reactions.* The longer threads generally
appear to be broken up into strings of darkly-staining granules, owing doubtless to

x the character of the membrane which, being mucilaginous, is easily swollen.

3 In some transverse sections of the inner phloem a young medullary ray may occur,

8 the cells of which may be distinguished by the fact that radial threads are present

& piercing the tangential wall. The young medullary-ray cells appear at first to con-

sist almost entirely of companion or albuminous cells; but in the older cotyledons

&% starch-containing medullary-ray cells are also present.

= The cambial zone between the phloem and xylem is composed of thin-walled

=, rectangular cells in whose walls threads have not yet been very successfully demon-

6 strated, though they are without doubt present.t Russow states that he has seen

2 threads with ease in cambium,} but this statement needs further confirmation.

‘2 The Xylem,.—The xylem is the less conspicuous portion of the bundle, and consists

'B of few vessels arranged in a broadened V-shaped mass (fig. 2, Plate 31). The

5 existence of connecting threads in the wood vessels and cells is difficult to demon-

8 strate, and remains as yet an unsolved problem, one of the difficulties being that most

*g protoplasmic stains also colour the lignified tissues.
