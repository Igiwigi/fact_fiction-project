The field samples provide evidence because
the seasonal effect was reduced in the ALAN-treated commun-
ities after five months of exposure. After 1 year of artificial
illumination in the lit site, this trend continued with the pre-
treated sediment no longer showing a clear seasonal response
to temperature. In fact, results from the pre-treated sediment
community suggest that ALAN may be the sole trigger and
that it may override other seasonal triggers such as tempera-
ture. Consequently, this results in a loss of temporal structure
and may lead to a loss of diversity. ALAN represents a sustained perturbation that may have
long-term cumulative effects.
