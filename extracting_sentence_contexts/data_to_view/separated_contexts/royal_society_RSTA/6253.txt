By choosing only the Macdonald functions, Kn, as the
basis for the multi-polar sources and neglecting the Hankel functions, we construct the so-called
evanescent multipole devices. As a result, the analogous treatment of the active exterior cloak for
a thin plate somewhat simplifies. In fact, we only require that the devices cancel the incident wave
Uinc inside a small closed region 2 surrounding the origin, since the constraint of decay at infinity
is automatically satisfied by the nature of the evanescent devices. We denote the sum of the fields generated by Q evanescent devices located at a distance 4 |
x? =6 from the origin (outside the region 92) by ugey(r,@) and require that ugey = —Winc for
réQ. The desired field may be actualized by taking a linear combination of outgoing waves -s
emanating from the devices’ centres xl,. : xe as : =
