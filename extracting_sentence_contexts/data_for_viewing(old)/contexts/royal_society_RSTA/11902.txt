lengths proportional to their intensities,

It becomes evident at once that the radiation spectrum is most distinctly not
identical with the Fraunhofer spectrum; the most important point is that some of
the strongest bright lines do not appear among the dark ones in the solar spectrum,
while some of the strongest dark lines are not seen bright in the spectrum of the
stratum of vapours in immediate contact with the photosphere. The region covered
by the diagram lies between wave-lengths 4100 and 4300, but similar results follow
when other regions are included in the inquiry.

These positive conclusions are not weakened by the consideration that the resolving
power of the prismatic cameras employed is not sufficiently great to show all the
lines of the Fraunhofer spectrum, which is used as a term of comparison ; in fact,

working under exactly the same conditions as during the eclipse, the instrument
employed in Africa only shows 104 lines in the spectra of stars resembling the sun,
in the region h to H, in place of 940 given in Rowxanp’s tables of lines in the solar
spectrum. We, therefore, get a better term of comparison if we employ the spectrum
of some star, such as Arcturus, which closely resembles the sun. Such a comparison
is shown in Plate 14; out of 104 lines which the instrument is capable of depicting
in the region h to H, only 40 are shown in the spectrum of the base of the sun’s
atmosphere. This comparison amply confirms the conclusion that the lines reversed
