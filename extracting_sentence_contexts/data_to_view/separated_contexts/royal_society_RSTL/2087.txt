MDCCCXXVI. 3E


390 Sir Humeury Davy on the relations of

different modifications, was the cause of all the phenomena exhi-
bited by different Voltaic combinations. Believing that our philosophical systems are exceedingly
imperfect, I never attached much importance to this hypo-
thesis ; but having formed it after a copious induction of
facts, and having gained immediately by the application of it
a number of practical results, and considering myself as
much the author of it as I was of the decomposition of the
alkalies, and having developed it in an elementary work, as
far as the present state of chemistry seemed to allow, I have
never criticised or examined the manner in which different
authors have adopted or explained it,â€”contented, if in the
hands of others' it assisted the arrangements of chemistry or
mineralogy, or became an instrument of discovery. And
having now given what I believe to be a faithful sketch of its
origin, I shall not enter into an examination of those works
which have induced me to make this sketch, and which con-
tain partial or loose statements on the subject, and which
refer the origin of electro-chemistry to Germany, Sweden
and France, rather than to Italy and England and which
attribute some of the views of the science, which I first deve-
loped, to philosophers who have never made any claim of the
kind, and who never could have made any, as their works
on the subject were published many years after 1806. III.
