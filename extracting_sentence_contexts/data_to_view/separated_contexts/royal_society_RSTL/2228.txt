The weighing of those first
killed was neglected ; of the three which died last, two (males) weighed 510 grains
each; the other (a female) 560 grains. Their stomachs were pretty largely developed,
but empty: in the intestine there was a small quantity of yolk remaining, coloured
greenish yellow in the inferior part, from the admixture of bile *. All these facts seem to show a very slow development, and are in accordance with
a long period of utero-gestation ; and I may add, in favour of the same, that the ova
in the ovaria of all the three parent fish were very small, the largest of them not ex-
ceeding a pea, and the majority of their minute yesicles containing a transparent
fluid. Other inferences might be drawn from these details, especially in favour of the
branchial filaments being absorbent organs, rather than supplying the place of gills
(the gills being apparently useless in utero when formed) ; but I am afraid of tres-
passing further on the time of the Society on a subject of limited interest. In the beginning of this paper, I have alluded to the discrepancy; which exists
amongst writers on natural history relative to the mode of generation of the Torpedo.
