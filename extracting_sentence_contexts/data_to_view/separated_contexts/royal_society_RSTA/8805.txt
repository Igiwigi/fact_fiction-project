When A, is
considerable, its value is known sufficiently well for it to determine the multiple,
and then this exact integer conversely gives the exact value of A, In the cases of
A and Ne, however, the values of A, are too small to determine uniquely this multiple
directly. The difficulty, however, is surmounted by obtaining successively values
with increasing accuracy from other considerations until the final test can be applied. As a fact the Ne oun is amongst the most accurate found. Its determination (p. 461)
is specially interesting, and indeed is only possible because the material at disposal
depends on interferential measures and large accurately known separations. That
of X also is a good determination, and is interesting as depending on a number of
quite independent data.
