There is one further point in connection with the amnion that calls for brief comment,
and that is the apparent prolongation of the amniotic cavity along the posterior
(morphologically dorsal) aspect of the connecting stalk (text-figs. 12 and 13). This
condition appears to be brought about by the non-separation and subsequent elongation
of the proximal segment of the connecting stalk, situated immediately behind the
primitive streak, between that and the upper limit of the extra-embryonal ccelom, so
that the tail-fold of the amnion, arising at that limit, overlaps it in its forward growth.


82 J. P. HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES.

The interest of this condition lies in the fact that it is met with in all the higher
Primates from the Platyrrhine monkeys to man. In the human embryo, Dr. FLortan*
considers that it subserves two purposes: (1) it provides room for the free backward
growth of the tail-end of the embryo, and (2) it facilitates the rotation of the connecting
stalk from its original postero-dorsal position to its definitive attachment to the ventral
body-wall. In Tarsius, it clearly subserves the first purpose (text-fig. 13) but it should
be noted that, in this form, the connecting stalk never occupies a postero-dorsal position
but is, from its first origin, posterior to the embryonic body.

The foregoing brief summary of the salient features in the early development of
Tarsius affords ample justification for the contention that in the mode of development
