Ox, Ox2 Oxp

In principle, to ensure that the extremum is indeed a minimum, one also has to check that the Hessian matrix of second-
order partial derivatives has only strictly positive eigenvalues, a condition generically satisfied for squared error functions
like the one considered here.

Differentiating (6.1) with respect to x; gives
aa MN Moa > M
aa, = Yon [eiCuiy, — aj) | = 2), EjYj(XKY; — Ij), 6.3)

where we used the fact that XY; does not depend on x, if i#k. Then,

and the conditions dA/dx;=0 and 0A/dy;=0 for all i and j can be rewritten as
