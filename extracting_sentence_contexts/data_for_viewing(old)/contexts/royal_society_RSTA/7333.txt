There are two elements of uncertainty in these calculations. The first concerns the
contribution from the glass splinters of the radon bulb, some of the radiations from which
will be absorbed in the glass and therefore will not affect the main solution. It was decided
that half the total energy of both the a- and f-particles emitted from the splinters should be
considered as being absorbed by the solution. In the later experiments the correction was
in any case small.

The second uncertainty arises from the fact that the radon is not completely removed
as soon as the tube is opened; the amount in solution probably decreases roughly expo-
nentially during the removal period. By taking samples of solutions during and after the
radon removal period it was estimated that 1 min. could be taken as the ‘average life’ of

the radon in the solution, after the opening of the vessel; when calculating the dose 1 min.
was, therefore, added to the main exposure and deducted from the time of the last stage
of the irradiation process.
