wings running along its angles. The difference in the dimensions of the spores is not
sufficient to justify us in regarding them as microspores and macrospores of the same
species, nor would such a suggestion be consistent with the other marked distinctions
between the strobili.

On the other hand, the two species, distinct as they are, have much in common.
The general anatomy is similar ; in this respect the two forms resemble each other
more closely than they resemble any other known strobilus. The sporophylls, with
their broad lamin, sharply marked off from the almost cylindrical petiole, are
characteristic of both forms jointly. The insertion of the sporangium, by a narrow
attachment, to the upper surface of the sporophyll, where it begins to expand into
the lamina, is as I have shown, essentially the same in both. The spores also have
something in common, at least in the fact that they are winged, while the form and
structure of the sporangium are alike in both.

These various points of agreement and difference find, I believe, their best expres-
sion, if we regard the two forms as two species of the same genus.

We now come to the more important question of the relation of these forms to
other plants, and especially to other members of the Paleozoic Flora.

That the strobili are Lycopodiaceous can scarcely be questioned, for this conclusion
