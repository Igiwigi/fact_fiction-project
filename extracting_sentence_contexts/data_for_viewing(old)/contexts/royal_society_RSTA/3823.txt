medium, then equation (4.21) is akin to a discretized version of the heat equation with the
Maxwell-Cattaneo regularization term. This term, transforming the heat (partial differential)
equation into a damped wave equation, was historically introduced to create a maximum speed of


propagation of heat in the medium [35]. We also note that at every moment the finite subsystems
are at equilibrium with their respective finite bath. This property corresponds to the ‘local
equilibrium’ assumption in thermodynamics, a paradigm which allows us to write dynamical
equations for the thermodynamic quantities far from global equilibrium. Nevertheless, one can
with the formalism presented in this paper interconnect dynamical systems in arbitrary patterns,
not just those that arise from such a dicretization.

In fact, the scope of systems we can model includes those considered in [5], and goes beyond
their axiomatic approach in that we propose a detailed dynamic description of internal states and
correlations within and across systems. In particular, we generalize ectropy with meta-energy,
which accounts for those cross-system correlations, and behaves as a Lyapunov function even as
heat can momentarily flow from cold to hot systems, a possibility indeed allowed by (4.21).

To conclude this section, let us mention that establishing the validity of Fourier’s law even
in the non-equilibrium stationary case from microscopic dynamics is a notoriously difficult
problem [36]. We circumvent it here by the use of finite baths, defined by a phenomenological
macroscopic dynamics rather than derived from microscopic first principles. In counterpart, we
obtain a satisfactory dynamical description beyond the stationary solution.
