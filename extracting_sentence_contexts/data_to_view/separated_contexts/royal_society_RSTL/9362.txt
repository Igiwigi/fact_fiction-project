The various quadric relations between the theta-functions, admitting that
they constitute a 13-fold relation, show that the theta-functions may*be expressed as
proportional to functions of two arbitrary parameters z, y ; and two of these functions
being assumed at pleasure the others of them would be determinate ; we have of course
(though it would not be easy to arrive a it in this manner) such a system in the
foregoing expressions of the 16 functions in terms of a, y; and conversely these
expressions must satisfy identically the quadric relations between the theta-funetions.

126. To show that this is 80 as to the general form of the equations, consider first,

the zy-factors Va, ab, &. As regards the squared functions (V/ab)?, we have for

instance

1 = E-

(v/cd*=4z{edfa,b,e, +c,d fabe+ 2/XY},

each of these contains the same irrational part av XY, and the difference 1s

therefore rational ; and it is moreover integral, for we have

(Vab)?—(vcd)*=gi(abe,d,—a,b,cd)(fe,—fe),
where each factor divides by 0, and consequently the product by & ; the value is in
fact

1, a+b, ab
1, c+d, cd

a linear function of 1, &+y, xy ; and this is the case as regards the difference of any
two of the 8quares (/ab)?, (/ac)?, &c. ; hence electing any one of these squares for

instance (4/de)?, any other of the squares is of the form
Mbp(rty)+rey+p(vde}*; (p=1)

and obviously, the other squares (x/@)?, &c., are of the like form, the last coefficient p

being =0. We hence have the theorem that each square can be expressed as a linear
ſanction of any four (properly selected) squares.
