No. 223 is intense * in O, but only b. im . . . - CO
No. 26 s is wyb. in . O, but one of many very fine in CO

No. 39 is faintin . O, but a # as bright asqin . CO

The # group is not nearly s0 bright in O as in CO.

Besides these differences, O has ten wanting in CO, among which are No. 38 7, very
bright, and No. 44 0, in all its brilliancy ; while CO has eight wanting in O, of which
No. 75 is a #; the difference being greater than I have sometimes found with much
less chemical agreement.

The only conclusion which such facts permit is, that the spectrum is a simple resultant
of all the actions present, some of which may combine to produce an exalted effect,
while others may be antagonistic in any degree. :

4. As to the manner in which electricity produces the rays of these lines, whether by
merely heating the medium, or by some luminiferons action analogous to its heating,
nothing is really established. Heat is known to produce 80me brilliant lines when metallic
vapours are introduced into flames; and it is possible that a temperature far above that
of our hottest flame might bring out all those which I have enumerated, and the multi-
tude of others which I did not attempt to measure. But is the temperature of the elec-
