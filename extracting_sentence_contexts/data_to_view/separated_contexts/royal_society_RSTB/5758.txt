In other words, conditions
here are not parallel to those found in the Urodeles: in that group, the neural plate
stretches away in front of the region of invagination and an implanted dorsal lip of the
blastopore may therefore induce a plate not all of which overlies graft tissues. In
the chick, since the neural plate is co-extensive, or nearly so, with the region of invagina-
tion, it is to be expected that the whole of the induced plate will overlie implanted
material. This is, in fact, usually the case. In some cases, however, the induced plate
extends rather further posterior than the inducing plate; this is probably due to the
development of the posterior part of the inducing plate being obscured or prevented
by the unfavourable conditions under which it is growing. The question of the possible orientation of induced plates is of interest ; the orientation
is, of course, determined by that of the inducing plate, but it is interesting to inquire
whether a medullary plate can be induced at any angle to the normal neural plate of
the same epiblast.
