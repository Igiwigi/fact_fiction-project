increasing angle, the plates will change from grazing incidence to the normal, but
the colour will not change towards the violet or shorter wave-length, as has always
been aftirmed,} but towards the red, because the path of light within the plates is
becoming longer, If it can be shown that as a matter of fact the colours do change

+ For instance, MICHELSON, A. A., loc, cif. (see p. 3), says that in birds and insects “the change of
colour with changing incidence strictly follows the law already mentioned—the colour always changing
towards the blue end of the spectrum as the incidence increases.” Watrer, however (loc. cit., see p. 2),
the only physicist who has carefully observed a large number of insects, states that there are exceptions
to the general rule, ¢.g., Papilio epiphorbas Boisp., which turns from blue to green at grazing incidence.
But he has attributed this anomaly to the fact that “the scales are only coloured slightly and are so
raised that at grazing incidence the body-colours are seen, whereby the displacement of the colour
becomes quite abnormal,” (See BANcrort, W., ‘J. phys. Chem.,’ vol. 23, p. 448 (October, 1919).)


AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR IRIDESCENT COLOURS. 15

towards the red, it appears conclusive proof that these plates are the effective cause
of colour,

All the insects that could be obtained were examined and their colour changes
noted, but it must be remarked at once that the observation is by no means an easy
one, chiefly because the wing is not flat, but usually undulating. Also the plane of the
