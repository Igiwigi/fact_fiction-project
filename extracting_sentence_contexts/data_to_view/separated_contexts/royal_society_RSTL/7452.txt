Or to take another example; for the fifth equation we have
DS Supp. (2, 3)=z(2z1, 3)+Q;
'S Q(=27) is the number of the line-pair-points described as © double tangent terminated
2 each way at point of contact,” or, in the point of view appropriate for the present purpose,
Z we have each double tangent as a coincident line-pair in respect to the one of its points
S of contact, and also as a coincident line-pair in respect to the other of its points of
f contact. Reverting to the generation of the equation, when the point P is a point in
E general on the given curve, the curve © is the system of conics (2, 3) touching the curve
© at P, and having besides with it a contact of the third order; since for each conic the
S number of intersections at P is =2, the total number of intersections at P is =2A(3; 3),
= and the remaining (2m—2)(2, 3) intersections are the points P'. Suppose that the point
8 P is taken at the point of contact of a double tangent ; of the (2, 3) conics, 1 (I asxume
this is 80) becomes the coincident line-pair formed by the double tangent taken twice,
and giyes therefore 4 intersections at P, the remaining (2, 3)—1 conics are proper

, 3)—2 intersections at P, or the total number of intersections

conics, giving therefore 2(2
As remarked

at P is 2(2, 3)+2 intersections; or there is a gain of 2 intersections.
(No. 96), this does not of necessity imply that the point in question is to be considered as
being (specially) 2 united points ; I do not know how to decide & priori whether it is to
be regarded as being 2 united points or as 1 united point, but it is in fact to be regarded
as being (specially) only 1 united point ; and as the points in question are the 2rT points
of contact, of the double tangents, we have thus the number 27 of special united points. MDCCCLXV11L. 2B


172 ON THE CURVES WHICH SATISFY GIVEN CONDITIONS. Again, when the point P is at a cusp, all the (2, 3) conics remain proper conies
((2z1, 3)=(2, 3), First Memoir, No. 73), but each of these (que conic touching the cuspidal
tangent) has with the given curve at the cusp not 2 but 3 intersections, 80 that the total
number of intersections at P is 3(2z1, 3), =3 (2,3), and there is a gain of (2 3) =(2z1, 3)
intersections.
