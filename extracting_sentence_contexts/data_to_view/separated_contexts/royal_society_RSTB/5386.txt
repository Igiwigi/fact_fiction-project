What actually happens is that it originates from the mid-dorsal
roofing of the connective tissue arch. The supradorsal forms only a curved wall at the
posterior end of the vertebra. The most striking fact described in this paper, which has not been recorded by any
previous worker, is that part of the dorsal arcualia, Â¢.e., except the supradorsal, degenerates. The degeneration does not take place in the basidorsal as a whole, but cartilaginous
cells together with the inner perichondrial layer degenerate, leaving behind the outer
perichondrial layer which is converted into bone. If we go through the series of transverse sections of a degenerated basidorsal we find,
first, the outer perichondrium, beyond which there is the connective tissue to complete
the arch, and the differences of these two tissues can very easily be detected.
