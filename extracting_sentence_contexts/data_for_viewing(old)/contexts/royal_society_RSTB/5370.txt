Pebble Bed (base of the Berkshire Oolites or Argovien = base of the Continental
shallow-water episode) resting upon the highest zone of the Oxford Clay, a condition
with which we are already familiar at Purton, Wilts. The greater part of Beds 2-5
must, however, be taken to represent the Osmington Oolite Series, or Rauracien.

We are now left with 31 ft. of beds at the top of the section, which bring the total
thickness of strata assigned by Dr. Mortey Davies to the Corallian up to 55-60 ft.,
three times the thickness of the Ampthill Clay in Cambridgeshire according to Dr. RastaLu
[35, p. 209], and nearly three times the thickness of the “ Upper Corallian ” in most of
the quarries about Oxford.

At this point the fauna of the “ stone-band with Perisphinctids,” Bed 6, comes to
our aid. The Perisphinctids are, in fact, finely ribbed, narrow-whorled forms, some
approaching the P. warte type, others with a very pronounced forward sweep of the
ribbing on the periphery. The latter character has been taken by Mr. Buckman to
be indicative of a high horizon for the Perisphinctids from the Littlemore Clay Beds
{9, p. 61], but whereas specimens have been obtained from Lower horizons comparable
with the Littlemore examples, in no instance at Littlemore has this forward sweep on
the periphery occurred to such a marked degree as in the examples from Bed 6 at Ashen-
don. ‘The most conspicuous fossils after the Perisphinctids in this stone band are Alari,
of types occurring in the T'rigonia clavellata Beds and in the higher parts of the Osmington
Oolite Series of Dorset. ‘This fossil band tells us definitely, I think, that we have
here an horizon probably equivalent to some part of the T'rigonia clavellata Beds of
Dorsetshire.
