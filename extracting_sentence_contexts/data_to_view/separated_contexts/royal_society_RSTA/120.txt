For a particle fraction of 6 = 24, this deviation
appears around ¢ =2.5 x 10*At, whereas for & =39y it already appears around t= 1.5 x 10*At. This change in the evaporation rate could be related to the deformation of the particles. In fact, in
figure 7b, one can observe the time evolution of the instantaneous volume of the particles. In the
initial state, all particles have the same volume of Vo. When a particle adsorbs at the fluid—fluid
interface, the surface tension exerts a tensile force on the particle boundary, and thereby reduces
its volume.
