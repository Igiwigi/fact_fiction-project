as before, equation (203). This method (207) is analogous to (204).

§37, There are several other ways of representing the attraction, employing fictitious
matter and current ; but now let us change the method, and observe how the attrac-
tion between the magnetic pole and the iron mass is accounted for by a stress dis-
tribution, and its space-variation. The best stress is the third, equation (188), § 31.
Applying this, we have simply a tension of magnitude 4y,R,? = T, in the first medium

and 4y,R,’=T, in the second, parallel to R, and R, respectively, each combined
with an equal lateral pressure, so that the tensor of the stress vector is constant.

But, so far as the attraction is concerned, we may ignore the stress in the second
