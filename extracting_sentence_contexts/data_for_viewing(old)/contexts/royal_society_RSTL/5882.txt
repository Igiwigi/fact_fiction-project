are any afferent and efferent trunks leading directly to and from these 80-called rudi-
mentary gills. In fact, in most of the Brachiopods the inner lamina of the pallial
sinuses is more or less bulged out ; it only happens that in Z. anatina the bulging is to
a greater extent, and the sinuses, being parallel, assume a plaited or laminated character.
In L. affinis the sinuses are branched?, and consequently the gill-like structure is not by
any means 80 distinct, though the walls of the sinuses are much inflated?*.

"This modification of the inner lamina of the mantle is much of the nature of those
various modes of increase of surface observed in the pallial fringes and processes of
various mollusks, all of which, there can be little doubt, assist in a&rating the blood,

'The great extent of brachial organ is also worthy of remark. In J?. psittacen, for in-
stance, the arms, when stretched out, are 44 inches long, being upwards of four times the
length of the shell ; and they give support to about 3000 cirri, To account for the enor-
