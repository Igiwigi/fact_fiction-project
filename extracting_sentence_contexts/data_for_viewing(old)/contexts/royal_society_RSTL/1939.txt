The phenomena of tetanus, in its effects upon the limbs, enable us to conceive
more distinctly than we should otherwise do, the effect of the reflex function
in its natural state, in maintaining the due degree of balance and antagonism
of the muscles and firmness of the limbs.

If a few drops of dilute hydrocyanic acid be placed upon the tongue of a
frog, a state of things the reverse of that just described as the effect of opium
or strychnine is induced: the contractions which depend on the reflex function
are observed to become less and less energetic and excitable, and at length
cease altogether.

* Having observed these facts in connexion with the reflex function, it became a question whether
the rigidity of the muscles immediately consequent to death depends upon the same principle. Two
rabbits were killed; in one the spinal marrow was destroyed, in the other it was left entire. Both,
however, became equally rigid. $0 that the spasm of death-is a mere effect of irritability, and not of
the reflex function of the spinal narrow.

Having thus detailed the phenomena of the reflex function, as they are ob-
served in their ordinary and augmented and diminished degrees of force, I
shall briefly enumerate some of those excited motions observed in yarious parts
of the animal frame, which are obviously referrible to the same function.
