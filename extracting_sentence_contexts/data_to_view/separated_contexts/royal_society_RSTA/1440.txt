Far
from being a threat to the scientific method, the weaknesses of blind big data methods serve
as a timely reminder that the scientific method remains the most powerful means we have to
understand our world.

2. Reproducibility

In science, unlike politics, it does not matter how many people say or agree about something:
if science is to be objective, it has to be reproducible (within the error bars). Observations and
‘scientific facts and results’ cannot depend on who is reporting them but must be universal. The consensus is the business of politics and the scientific equivalent only comes after the
slow accumulation of unambiguous pieces of empirical evidence (albeit most research and
programmes are still funded on the basis of what the majority of people on a review panel thinks
is right, so that scientists who have previously been successful are more likely to be awarded
grants [22,23]). There is some debate about the definition of reproducibility [24].
