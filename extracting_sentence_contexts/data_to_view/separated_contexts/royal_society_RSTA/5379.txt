In the first case we choose a kernel
and carrying capacity functions (G(u) = gu), K(u)=sech(u/o)), such that
the natural solution exists and is positive everywhere. Thus it is stable,
and it is the steady state attained at long times. In fact it can be analytically
calculated,

Ww (uw) = a7! sechÂ®(u/o). (2.8)

In the second case the non-positiveness of the kernel used (with a carrying
capacity of the type equation (2.2)) breaks down the initial configuration into
umps, which at long times approach zero-width delta functions with forbidden
zones in between. In the third case, despite G, being positive, a positive natural
solution does not exist. Several outcomes are possible but, for the kernel and
capacity used, the system approaches a single hump solution which vanishes in
yart of the niche space.
