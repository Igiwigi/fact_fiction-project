This I can prove to myself in several ways. First, I find that among the various tones
in the gamme of yellow, there is one, namely that numbered 16, which perfectly matches,
to my eye, the © rouge” in the circle: Secondly, I can make very nearly this appearance
of red to my eye, by mixing 1 part by measure of lampblack with 5 or 6* of chrome-
yellow powder, 80 as to darken it to the required tone. And thirdly, I can produce, on
Mr. MaxweLL's colour-top, a tolerable match to the carmine card, by a combination of
about 90 parts black with 10 parts chrome.

12. It may be safely stated, therefore, that what is ordinarily called red, is distinctly
visible to my colour-blind eye, not as an individual colour, but as a shade of yellow.

* These quantities are only given approximately to illustrate the fact ; they are very difficult to get accu-
rately. The proportions by mixing powders are very different to those required by rotation to produce the
ame hue ; and eyen when this has been tolerably arrived at, the quality of the pigments has much influence
on the appearance of the match.

Now if I follow the Chevreul circle, starting from red, and going round, in the direction
ofa watch-hand, towards blue, in every division which I pass, the sensation of yellow
becomes fainter and fainter, and at the same time the darkening shade becomes more
and more powerful, until very s0on the yellow disappears altogether, and nothing but a
dark grey or perfectly colourless hue remains. 'This point is still within the limit of
