stream from a perpendicular height of about ten inches: the sand having been 80
arranged, that after the melted brass had reached the depth of two inches, the re-
mainder continued to flow off; the melted brass as it began to cool was therefore
continually replaced with hot brass ; and from the height at which it was poured, it
was necessarily in immediate contact with the surface of the cold metal, and s00n
completely fused it, and perfectly united it in that place. This was repeated in thirty-
four different places, marked by dots in the figures: it was also tried in the places
markede, c,(fig.3.) but failed. When the redundant brass had been removed with a saw,
and the surface made smooth, a slight hair crack was perceptible at the boundary of
the fused metal, proceeding no doubt from expansion and contraction after the brass
had ceased to be fluid, but before it had become ductile. This process is made use
of by the brass-founder in stopping holes in defective castings; he calls it burning.
The failure of this process at the places marked c, c, is a fact which it would be im-
portant to keep in view in disposing of the parts of a large speculum. As it was de-
sirable that some further attempt should be made to secure the joint at c, c, holes of
about one inch and a half in diameter were bored completely through at c, and the

intermediate brass chiseled out, as represented in the figure. They were then filled
with melted brass, which was easily effected by imbedding the whole in sand ; clear-
ing the sand completely out of the spaces, and pouring the brass into each through a
hole in a flat surface of sand packed in a small flask ; when the brass cooled, the con-
traction was sufficient to draw the joint firmly together. This process may, possibly
