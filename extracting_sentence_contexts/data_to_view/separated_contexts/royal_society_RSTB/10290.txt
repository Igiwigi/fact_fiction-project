Genomic analysis shows the following: (i) the use of transmission of mitochondria. UPI decreases within-cell 5
gene conversion, limiting the accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA variation but increases variation
absence of meiosis; (ii) an increase of genes defending against between cells, leading to efficient purifying selection of cells
transposons, with transposable elements being restricted to with higher levels of mutations [83]. In fact, the combination
3% of the genome; (iii) highly abundant horizontal gene trans- of UPI with multi-level transmission bottlenecks (so absent
fer, 8% of genes probably having been obtained by this mitochondrial recombination) seems to give rise to purifying
mechanism. An important conclusion in the light of the selection levels that are indistinguishable from those found
‘ROS-sex connection’ proposed here: gene families involved for recombining nuclear genes [84]. Modelling studies even
in ROS resistance are strongly expanded as well [77].
