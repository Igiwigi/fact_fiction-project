= In the eggs of many animals the periods follow one another with great uniformity,
and the irregularity in the present case is therefore 8omewhat unusnal. It depends
Herhaps on the fact that the embryo is solid, and that during the whole segmentation
-Hhe cleavages take place nob only in planes at right, angles to the surface, but also in
Planes parallel to it. The latter cleavages would not be visible externally, but might
tard the gurface cleavages ab certain periods. This is apparently the true explana-
Sion of the long delay of forty-five minutes between figs. 5 and 7 ; for, as we shall see
1 the following section, the delamination, by means of which the layers are separated,
Hakos Place ab this period when the embryo consists of sixteen spheres.

FI 2. The mode of segmentation which has been deseribed occurred with slight varia-
Zions in rather less than one-third of all the eggs studied. In the mosb usual case,
However, the eight-sphere stage is entirely passed over, and the egg divides at once
Into 8ixteen spheres ab the first cleavage.
S This mode of cleavage, illustrated by figs. 30 to 87, is, except in the first stage,
