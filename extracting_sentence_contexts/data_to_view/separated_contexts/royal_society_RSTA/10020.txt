The
author was himself conscious of certain inherent sources of error in his experimental
method, which influenced the results quite irregularly and often in a very annoying
manner (‘in oft recht unliebsamer Weise”). In view of this admission it is difficult
to say what is the precise significance of his work. Whilst fully recognising that he
was dealing with a surface phenomenon entirely, BopENsTerN concluded that it is
impossible to deduce any mathematical expression for his results other than the
equation for a reaction of the third order. ‘This, of course, means that, notwith-
standing the fact that the reaction was entirely confined to the layer of gas
immediately in contact with the walls of the reaction vessel, its velocity was governed
by its “order” in accordance with the law of mass action. We shall, however, have
no difficulty in proving that this conclusion is wrong.
