to the sporophyll.

There are two ways in which, without departing from this stereotyped plan, an

* T wish particularly to point out that the Selago condition, that is, the imperfect differentiation of the
fertile from the sterile regions, was not unknown in the Palwozoie period. Scorr remarks (‘ Studies in Fossil
Botany,’ p. 501) that “all the well-known Paleozoic Lycopods had perfectly definite strobili.” It is true
that the best known types had definite strobili, but some of the smaller forms had not. K1pston has
described in his new species Lycopodites ciliatus how “ the sporangia seem to have been borne at the base of
the leaves on an ordinary branch, which does not appear to have been much modified, or to form a
distinct cone.” He further remarks that the genus Lycopodites, though it seems rare, is perhaps commoner
than suspected, through being overlooked (Kinston, ‘Trans. Nat. Hist. Soc. Glasgow,’ vol. 6, part 1, p. 36).
It is also the fact that the Selago condition occurs in the Sphenophyllew, in S. majus (Kupston, /.c., p. 128).
This is also very beautifully seen in a photograph of a specimen from the Brussels Museum, shown
me by Mr. Kipston.

The fact that this undifferentiated state existed in early fossils is important, as showing that it is not
merely a character acquired in recent times. It may, therefore, be legitimately used in arguments as to
the families of plants represented in the Palmozoic period. On its general morphological bearings, compare
