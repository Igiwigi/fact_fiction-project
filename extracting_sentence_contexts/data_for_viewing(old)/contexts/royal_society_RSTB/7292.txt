of an apochromatic lens? These were the questions to which answers were required when
this research began, so far as the lens system of the eye was concerned, but there were other
questions, no less important, which concerned the retina. Here is a structure which
provides the eye with excellent colour perception. For this purpose it consists of photo-
receptors responding to different parts of the spectrum. According to the well-known
trichromatic theory of Thomas Young, there were three kinds of receptor; according to


524 H. HARTRIDGE ON THE

Granit’s recent researches (Granit 1943, 1945) on the mammalian retina, there are seven
kinds for colour perception. If then red light stimulates only a few of all the receptors
present, how can we explain the fact that the visual acuity of the eye for fine detail by red
light is of such a high standard as to require every one of the photoreceptors present in the
human retina to be red sensitive? This is the situation so far as acuity, when using red light,
is concerned, but the same question presents itself with regard to acuity when using yellow,
green and blue lights.

One further question concerning the retina requires an answer, namely: Can any evidence
be obtained for the existence in the human retina of the seven types of receptor with sharp
responses (‘modulators’), and the one type of receptor with broad response (‘dominator’),
which Granit has discovered, as mentioned above, in the retinae of many mammals, by
means of his ingenious micro-electrode technique? It was principally in order to answer
this question that the micro-stimulation apparatus described in Part X was designed.
