measurement of the individual fibres, and I have been unable to determine whether,
or not, they are grouped in the conical fascicles demonstrated by Ocrtvie in the
trabeculae of Recent Corals (1897, p. 117). Frequently there is a suggestion that
the trabecula includes a number of rod-like aggregates of fibres, with a light axis
and a dark margin, similar to those described later in Acanthocyclus and Tryplasma.
The following explanation of the formation of the septa of P. porpita seems
reasonable. Secretion of a septum was begun in a radial series of small, isolated,
conical invaginations* in the base of the polyp. From each a monacanth was

* This is in agreement with the facts observed by von Kocu (1882, a) in Asteroides calycularis and
by Duerpven (1904) in Siderastraea radians.

eventually formed. As the individual grew, the invaginations grew taller, and their
lower parts widened till they coalesced to form a deep radial groove with conical
invaginations along its summit (fig. 1). New growths of fibres were continually
begun at the apices, and added to by the sides, as the invaginations increased (fig. 11).
The fibres were always laid down at right angles to the secreting surface, so that those
formed at the apex were directed upwards, and those added from the coalesced sides
were horizontal and constitute the lateral or “dilated” part of the monacanth.
