The terms vo and Tos are already known, so this problem is linear in v, and Ts. Moreover, it
can be written in terms of velocity and the trace of Tj; as

1 1 1. 1 .
~Rored (; tr %) = ~—(grad vo)v + BR div [same v, + grad vi | in =| (3.28)

div v; =0 in 2,

where v1 = ((V1)x, (¥1)y,0) and the term G tr T,) are unknown. Note that only the gradient on the
left-hand side and the first term on the right-hand side of the first equation have components in
the z-direction.

The two-dimensional nature of the problem and the fact that the divergence of the velocity is
zero guarantees the existence of a streamfunction y such that

a

Next, on calculating the curl of the conservation of linear momentum (3.28) and substituting
the streamfunction (3.29) yields
