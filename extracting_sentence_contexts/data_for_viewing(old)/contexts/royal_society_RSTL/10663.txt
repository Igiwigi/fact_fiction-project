Dr. G. R. A. WRriGnr on the various preparations known as aconitine.

The evidence given ab the trial of GrorGe HEexNRy LAMSON, a surgeon, at the
Central Criminal Court in 1882, for poisoning with aconitine, conferred greatly
increased importance upon any method of absolute physical measurement which might
be substituted for the ordinary tests in the identification of the dangerous alkaloids,
Almost all active alkaloids have a complex chemical constitution, and every complex
molecule in which carbon is in a certain state of condensation has a definite absorption
spectrum in the ultra-violet if not in the visible region. In mos cases the absorption
curve is peculiar and often strikingly characteristic, and only minute quantities of
material are actually required for obtaining measurements of spectra- from which such
curves may be plotted. The interest that attaches to an examination of the absorption
spectra of the alkaloids is not alone the fact that a means of recognising, detecting,
and estimating, sxuch substances may be devised, but still more that we may learn
something of their chemical constitution.

The experimental details.

The method of examination employed was that, deseribed in the Phil. Trans,
Vol. 170, p. 257, 1879, but the spectroscope was the short focussed instrument
employed for photographing the spectra published in the * Journal of the Chemical
Society,‚Äù vol. xli., p. 84.
