To
achieve it, we apply our variational bounds to estimate (\VT|?) ona general roll-based branching
flow design. By optimizing over all admissible ‘scale functions’ ¢(r), we discover the very same
scalings as in (1.3) and (1.4). In fact, we see no way out of these and the logarithmically corrected


bound they imply: we conjecture that

with the dots representing asymptotically negligible terms. This is for two-dimensional cooling;
the data in [51] suggest a pure power law scaling for optimal transport across a three-dimensional
layer.
