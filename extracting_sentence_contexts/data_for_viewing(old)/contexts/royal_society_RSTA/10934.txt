were to be rejected. These conditions could only be approximately followed in
practice when a large number of trees had to be dealt with from one neighbourhood,
and these series, I fancy, allow more to the personal equation of the gatherer than is
wholly satisfactory.

Series (i.). Somersetshire Hollies.

T owe this series of 26 leaves from each of 100 trees to Miss AGNrs Fry. Of these
trees, 56 were hedge-row hollies, and 44 wood trees or bushes growing in moist
places.* The counting of the prickles was in some part undertaken by Mr, Macrxop,

* Miss Fry writes to me: “The texture of the leaves seems rather different,—the wood hollies are
much less stout and harsh and more often have few prickles. In fact, I rather wonder if shade does not
affect the number. In the few cases where hedge-row hollies have very few prickles the leaves come from
the inside of the bush. I have carefully avoided the neighbourhood of berries,—and what is more
difficult of flower buds. But the holly has two flowers, one with abortive pistil and one with abortive
stamens. ‘The latter I suppose would drop away and leave no trace of their presence. But, on the
whole, I have avoided flower and berry-bearing bushes—it is easy to find bushes without either. And, so
far as my observation goes, I am not convinced that the neighbourhood of flowers or the top of the tree
causes modification .... It is very difficult to keep to a standard of counting for the tip, but I have
tried to do so. Doubtless the hollies too are of rather different ages, but I have avoided patriarchal trees,
though doubtful if this makes much difference in this case.” It will be seen that in this point, as in others,
much had to be left to the judgment of a careful observer.
