Already in the 1960s Vance Packard and others warned about
the risks that computers along with other technologies pose to privacy [1,6]. There is, however,
something rather unprecedented going on here. The ubiquity, the pace of development and the
very fact that big data has already become an unavoidable part of human life set the scene for an
intense and potentially destabilizing encounter between big data and ethical norms. For many,
this is far beyond an encounter; rather it is a brutal head-on collision, for example, between big
data applications and the norms protecting individual privacy [7]. The Snowden revelations about government surveillance confirmed growing fears about how
certain uses of big data can undermine not just privacy, but ultimately trust, democracy and
liberty [8].
