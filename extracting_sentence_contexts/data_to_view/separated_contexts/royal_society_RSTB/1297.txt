Tn Brapy’s specimens the parent form was microspheric. Vertical and horizontal
sections of the shell are figured, showing the small chambers continued to the centre. It is pointed out that these shells differ from those whose centre is occupied by a
primitive disc (the megalospheric forms, ¢f fig. 45), not only in the absence of the
primitive dise, but in the fact that the thickness of the shell at the centre is only one-
third of that of the megalospherie form. However, in alluding to the question of
dimorphism, Bravy considered that the evidence of Orbitolites supported the view
Suggested by Munrer-Cuatmas that the microspheric form was a modification of the

flegalospheric.
¢ In 1890, SCHLUMBERGER (35) described Adelosina polygonia, a new species of the
Riliolide. From the figures it appears that the dimensions of the megalosphere
ail microsphere of this species are, in particular instances, 216 ~ and 25 x 18 p
fespectively.
