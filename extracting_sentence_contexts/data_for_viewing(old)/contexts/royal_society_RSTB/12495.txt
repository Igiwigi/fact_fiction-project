associated body odour and facial preferences, and (ii) genetic
data from real couples, testing whether they are more dis-
similar than expected by chance. The results showed a
systematic, although moderate, preference for heterozygous

individuals in both odour and facial tests, which was stronger
in women than men. However, the results concerning MHC-
dissimilarity showed no overall consistent effect. While this
might be a consequence of conflating studies which show
opposite patterns (e.g. by combining effects in HC users
and non-users), follow-up analyses testing moderating effects
including HC use, stimulus type, and rater sex, also showed
no significant effect. In fact, studies on actual mate choice (as
compared to mate preference) showed a significant positive
effect of MHC-similarity. Further analysis revealed that
samples from genetically heterogeneous populations show
higher positive MHC assortment compared to those from
genetically homogenous populations, probably owing to
strong preference for ethnic homogamy. In other words, indi-
viduals in ethnically heterogeneous populations tend to pair
with partners of the same ethnicity, and as ethnicity also
affects MHC variation, the observed pattern can initially pro-
vide an impression of preference for MHC-similarity.

Based on the results of this meta-analysis, one might con-
