cinchona tannin. Hence it must be concluded that six-sevenths of the alkaloids exist
in the cells of this bark as insoluble tannates, the remaining seventh mainly existing in
Solution as quinate, though the solution is of course saturated with tannate in addition.

These combinations of the alkaloids with tannin are very sparingly s0luble in cold
water. The whole state of things in the bark resembles the equilibrium of solution and
precipitate which would result from a mixture of tannin, alkaloid, and quinic acid. The
quinie acid is only able to decompose a small portion of tannate, and the tannin. is not
able to precipitate the whole alkaloid from solution. Actual trial with the respective
substances produces these effects. It is to be remarked that there is no marked difference
in the proportions of the respective alkaloids which exist, in one or the other state, in
the cell-contents or in the liquid which moistens the whole. This is in harmony with
the impression, to which all the facts at present known seem to conduce, that all the
cinchona alkaloids are physiologically equivalent.

From the nature of the weak compound that quinovin is able to form with the cin-
chona. alkaloids, it is evident that none could exist in the presence of quinic acid.
Nearly the whole of the quinovin is to be found in the bark after the juice has been
$queezed out. 'The clear juice only contains-a very 8mall amount, and its presence is
readily explained by the faint solubility of this substance in water.

The whole of the quinovin exists therefore in the insoluble and free tate.

No thoroughly accurate means of determining the amount of the cinchona tannin has
yet been devised; neither gelatin, animal membrane, nor even plumbic acetate remoyes
