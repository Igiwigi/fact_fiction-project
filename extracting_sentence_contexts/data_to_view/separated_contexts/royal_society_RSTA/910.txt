Finite-time instabilities refer to the case where a finite-time Lyapunov exponent nee)
of the system becomes positive but only for a finite-time interval [1]. In this sense, extreme :
events are a special case of rare events and therefore it is important to emphasize their special [4
properties: DN

1. The fact that there is a dynamical mechanism involved often increases substantially 1a
the intensity of extreme events compared with rare events caused by a purely random
process. This is manifested by the heavy tail characteristics of the corresponding
probability distribution.

2. Extreme events are usually associated with complex tails in the PDF.
