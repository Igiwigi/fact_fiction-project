for the mind to form to itſelf ſome general iypotheſis,
which might ſerve to account for the appearances; and
the firſt that preſented itſelf was the following: that the

k atmoſphere ſurrounding our globe might- poſſibly be
8 compoſed of particles, whoſe {ſpecific gravities were
S really different; that the lighteſt were placed at the

in order to fee whether any difference could be diſcovered in their ſpecifie

occurred to Licutenant GLENIE, of the Royal Artillery, namely, that of
weighing equatorial and polar ſea-water, To this gentleman I am obliged for
