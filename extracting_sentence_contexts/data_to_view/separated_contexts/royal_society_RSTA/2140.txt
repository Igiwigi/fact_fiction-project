This section focuses on the design of the PWM-based perceptron, including the fundamental
theories, the circuits of its constituent parts, methods of PWM-based arithmetic, leading to the
construction of NNs. The design methods form the basis of extensive analysis supporting the
validation of the perceptrons integrated in a NN. A perceptron capable of voltage and frequency elasticity may be constructed by exploiting
the fact that relative temporal properties, such as a PWMâ€™s duty cycle, are resilient to voltage
and frequency variations. As the supply voltage reduces, any oscillatory activity, such as a clock
signal, may show a reduced amplitude and reduced frequency. However, the ratio between the
time within a period when the clock signal is high and the time within a period when the clock
signal is low stays the same as both would increase at the same rate.
