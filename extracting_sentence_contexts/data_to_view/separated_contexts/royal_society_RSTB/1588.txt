W. BRIDGE AND A.C, HADDON

Sacemenn (Joc. ett.) has suggested, the function of these areas ts to enable the air
bladder more promptly to react to pressure oscillations, or, a5 we have surmised, more
readily to allow vaviations in the volume of the contained gases to modify the bulk
and specific gravity of the Fish. The comparative freedom of the anterior vertebra: from snchylosis in the Cyprinule
is obviously velated to the fact that the air-bladder, including the anterior chamber,
lies free in the abdominal cavity, and is searcely, if at all, invested by skeletal ;
elements ; hence. as the bladder is less likely to be affected by any compression which —
may result from the flexure of the vertebral coluton during vigorous locomotor moye-
ments, anchylosis is unnecessary, or at all events does not take place to anything like
the same extent as in the Silurida,

Certain distinctive structural variations in the Siluridm are probably dependent
upon other modifications of a more direct physiological value, and in any comparison
with the Silavidie it is interesting to notice the necessary sequence of particalar
anatomical differences between the two when an initial modification is once started in
one of them. In the Silurids, the restrietton of volumetric variations in the anterior
chamber to its lateral expansion or contruction is in part brought about by the invest-
ment of its dorsal surface by the complex and fifth centra and the expanded arid
otherwise modified transyerse processes of the fourth aud fifth yertebra, which not
only prevents the expansion of the chamber dorsally, and to some extent anteriorly,
but indirectly aids in preventing expansion in other directions by affording thes
necessary surface for the direct attachment of the walls of the chamber to the skeleton
at certain definite points. But to prevent the flexure of the trank yertebre in
ordinary locomotion from exerting any influence on an air-bladdey so closely related.
to the skeleton, and secondarily on the Weberian ossicles, a more or less extensive
anchylosis of the anterior vertebrae takes place, as well as a more rigid and intimate
articulation with the skull than is usnally the case in other Ostariophysea The
necessity for a more rigid connection between the skull and the vertebral coluwim has
probably conditioned further modifications in the anterior vertebra, und may well
have been one of the eauses which have hastened the further atrophy of those rudi-
meutary’ vertebral centra that intervene between the basinecipital and the fourth
vertebra, and haye been partially dismembered in the formation of the different
Weberian ossicles from certain of their constitnent elements, The shortening of this
section of the vertebra] eolamn necessarily involves the bripus taking » position more
anterior than that which it occupies in the Cyprinids and exactly opposite the
acaphiom, with the final result. that the iniercalarium becomes useless as u sesamoid
ossicle, and degenerates to the insignificant and yartbly developed vestige by which
ilous it is yepresented tn the great majority of the Siluvidis,

On the other hand, it is not exey to attach uny precise physiological significance to
(he ixet that the saccus paravertebralis iu the Silorida: has entirely lost that com-
munication with the eranial cevity which it possesses iu the Cyprinidm, nor to certain
