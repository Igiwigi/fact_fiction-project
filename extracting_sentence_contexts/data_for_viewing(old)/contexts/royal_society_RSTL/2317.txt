and the other from a ganglion. Behind the third ganglion, the nerve from the cord
to the second pair of wings (i) receives a branch from the third series (4), while the
greater number of the nerves pass outwards to the muscles. A. series of these trans-
verse nerves exists, as in the Sphinx, just anterior to each of the remaining ganglia
(0,0, 0), unto the nerves of which they give a few filaments, while their main branches
are distributed separately among the trachee and museles, excepting only those of
the fourth, fi≈øth, and sixth series, which become approximated to the nerves from the
corresponding ganglia, and in the development of the Butterfly at this period, afford

us an instance of the commencement of an interesting fact before alluded to, the for-
mation of neryous trunks by the approximation and union of many fibres. The series
anterior to the fifth ganglion [5. (0)] is now greatly diverging, and the ganglion and
nerves are passing forwards and becoming united with it.

Seven hours after changing [Plate XVI. fig. 24.] there is still an enlargement of the
cerebral ganglia, optic nerves, five first ganglia, and their interyening cords. The
fourth and fifth have advanced closer together, and the very short cords which con-
nect them are 80 much increased in diameter as to resemble a separate ganglion (x) :
the distance between the fifth and sixth is diminished, and all the remaining ganglia
are lightly enlarged. The cords between them, just anterior to each ganglion, are also
Slightly enlarged, and are less irregularly disposed than in the previous stages. The
transverse neryes are beginning to assume their temporary ganglionic appearance
