234, Capt. KareR's further Experiments on the Light

P.S. A fact which appears to be somewhat analogous to
that which i have observed, has been remarked by Dr. BxeEw=
$TER in his late treatise on Philosophical Instruments. * It is a
curious fact,” he says, p. 44, © that the circular images or the
sections of the cone of rays, are never 80 distinct and well
defined after the rays have crossed—as they are before— ;”
and again, p. 193, ** the sections of the cones of light are, in
general, better defined, when they are taken between the object
glass and its principal focus,”
