in diameter. These cells seem to offer no point.of distinction from the usual
type of Leptosporangiate tracheids. Owing to the fact that all the sections are
transverse, the nature of the pittings on the walls is not ascertainable, but the trans-
verse appearance is suggestive of scalariform pits. Protoxylems are not absolutely
determinable because the sections are all transverse, but along the xylem band are
several groups of small elements at intervals, among which are in all likelihood the
protoxylem elements, which thus seem to lie on the outer side of the band. The cells between the xylem and the endodermis proved difficult of interpretation,
because they are of a distinctly unusual character.
