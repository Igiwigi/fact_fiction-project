See electronic supplementary material, appendix E for a discussion. Equation (3.21) applies to any unit structure. In addition, for any unit structure M* over a set
of coordinates M C w, equation (3.15) and the fact that the union of a set of units is itself a unit
means that «° — o™ > 0. Therefore using equation (3.21) to expand o™ gives

o? = Yocum” >-arTM, (3.22)

Equation (3.22) holds even if M* Cc .N“*, and at the other extreme, even if no unit in M* is also in
N*.

4. Strengthened second law for composite systems

In general, to evaluate the in-ex sum of local EPs on the rh.s. of equation (3.21) requires detailed
knowledge of the precise rate matrices during the process.
