They are therefore less able to compete with
the more rapidly growing Lucilia larvae than are the maggots of C. chloropyga, since they will
be faced with an even greater shortage of food towards the end of their developmental

period. ALLIED PHENOMENA IN SHEEP-BLOWFLY POPULATIONS 141 The differences in the mortality of Lucilia larvae in the two cases cited may be ascribed
to the fact that C. chloropyga is markedly superior to C. marginalis in its adaptation to the
situation. A greater proportion of the food supply is consumed by the C. chloropyga popula-
tion before Lucilia has completed its most rapid growth period and therefore less is available
to the latter species. (6) With Chrysomyia chloropyga
