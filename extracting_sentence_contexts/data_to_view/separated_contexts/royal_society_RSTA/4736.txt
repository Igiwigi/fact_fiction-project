for all a,a’,b and b’. Here p(A\a,b) denotes a probability density function over some hidden- 2 |
variable 4, conditional on the orientations of Alice and Bob’s measuring apparatuses,
represented by the points a and a’ (for Alice), and b and b’ (for Bob), on the unit 3
sphere. In fact, it may only be necessary to violate (4.8) partially [1,2], suggesting that 1B
this might be a fruitful area to explore in order to create viable realistic causal theories ig
of fundamental physics. However, an important objection to any proposed violation of :8
measurement independence is that it can give rise to correlations that seemingly have no basis et
in physical theory, suggesting some implausible fine-tuned conspiracy operating in the universe :
at large. Consider the example proposed by Bell himself [3], where a measurement orientation is set by
some pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).
