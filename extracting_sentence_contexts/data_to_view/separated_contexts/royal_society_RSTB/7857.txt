That this error is fairly general is indicated by the reports of the numbers of
cows and bulls shot during control work each year in Uganda, as given in the Game
Warden’s Reports from 1925 onwards. Sir William Gowers has pointed out (in corre-
spondence with the writer) that if the number of bulls reported shot is approximately
correct, it is impossible to explain the continued existance of male elephants in Uganda
unless an extraordinary degree of immigration from surrounding territories is assumed, if
the population was of the order it was estimated to be when control work began. It seems
certain that the number was not greatly under-estimated, and it is obvious that cows do
not in fact greatly outnumber bulls in the present population. Gowers endorses the writer’s
suggestion that the explanation lies partly in the faulty identification of sex. In the same
way, the difficulty of identifying the sex of an individual elephant in many cases may be
expected to lead to confusion in reporting seasonal movements of the animals, and mating
habits.
