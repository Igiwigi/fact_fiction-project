It is possible, moreover, that the. bed numbered 12 in the third may represent both the
8th and 12th of the two other sections. The same numbering has been retained in all
the sections to facilitate comparison. The total thickness of the missing beds amounts to no more than about 5 feet; the
fact, however, that they are not present may be significant., It amounts to this: by
removing 460 feet further into the ancient Bovey lake (for such I assume the area to
have been) —460 feet further from its ancient shore, that shore being the granitic region
of Dartmoor,—we leave behind two thin beds of sand, which do not reappear when we
advance 220 feet further in the same direction. CLAYS OF BOVEY TRACEY, DEVONSHIRE, 1027

Eliminating these beds, we have no and in the series below the uppermost bed of
lignite (No. 5) excepting No. 27, which occurs in all the sections, and, indeed, consti-
tutes a marked feature in the deposit as exposed at the © Coal-pit.” It is 133 inches
thick in the first section, no more than 19 in the second, and dwindles to 10 inches only
in the third; but no bed is more continuous or better marked: its comparatively
bright colour catches the eye, and indicates its presence along the entire length of the
excavation. It attains a till greater thickness in the western wall of the pit.
