Rosen’s original derivation of the characteristic functional based on the Hopf equation is mostly
straightforward. We recall that Rosen’s symbolic expression can be obtained without using the
Hopf equation, which is allegedly based on the idea of Novikov, §29.5 of [25]. See also [27], p. 252.
The rationale for including this is that the second derivation stands valid when we have external
forcing which is not necessarily white-in-time Gaussian. For simplicity, we illustrate it here using
the unforced equation.

We formally rewrite du/dt = Q[u] as

t
u6s,8)=uo(s) + [ Qluts, 2dr.

In fact, this virtually trivial recasting leads to a non-trivial result. Consider
exp (i0(x) - u(x, t)) = exp {ia : (0 + I, Q[u(x, t)] dr) |
0
=[ex {ioe : (v0 + i. Q[v(x,t)] ar)} exp (ifs T) — v(x, t))w(x, ar) D[v]P[w],
0 0

by virtue of (3.3). Plugging u(x,t) = u(x) + So Q[v(x, t’)] dr’ into the above equation, we have

t

exp (i0(x) - u(x, t)) = ] exp {ia : (uo + | Q[v(x, t)] ar)}
