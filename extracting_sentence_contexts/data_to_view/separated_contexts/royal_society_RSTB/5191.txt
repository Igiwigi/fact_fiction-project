Now if a plant from Oe. (biennis x
rubricalyx) F, was homozygous for two R factors, then all its gametes would contain
two chromosomes each bearing an R factor. If these two chromosomes paired with
each other in the F, hybrid with Oe. ammophila, instead of finding mates among the
ammophila chromosomes, then these F', hybrids would be homozygous for one pair of R
factors, and all their descendants would breed true for red buds, as is actually the
case. This hypothesis is the only one we have been able to devise which meets all the
facts. If true, it would support the hypothesis already proposed on other grounds,
that in some Oenothera hybrids a remating of some of the chromosomes takes place,
so that non-homologous chromosomes become homologues. This would also support
the suggestion made elsewhere (GATES, 1923) that the difference between homologous
and non-homologous chromosomes is less sharp in Oenothera than in some other
genera.
