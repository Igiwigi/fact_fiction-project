series begins increasing in 2012 and the 26N follows thereafter. As discussed by Desbruyéres
et al. [74] and Moat et al. [77], this is consistent with the southward propagation of high-latitude
water mass transformation anomalies as dense LSW production increased again starting in 2014.
By contrast, the 41N AMOC stays weaker than all other time series. The methodology used to
construct the 41N and 45N datasets is similar in that both use thermal wind, are based largely on
Argo float data and satellite altimetry. They differ in that the 41N dataset is referenced to Argo
float trajectories, which are corrected for eddy-noise using altimetry, while the 45N dataset is
referenced to altimetry-derived surface geostrophic velocities. The details of the disagreement in
variability between the 41N and 45N datasets warrants further research.

Finally, we note that no direct link has been found between AMOC strength in the subpolar
North Atlantic (as measured by OSNAP) and LSW formation [30]. This is in part due to
the fact that LSW spreads throughout the subpolar region after its formation, including into
the eastern subpolar North Atlantic [52]. Hence the geometry is fundamentally different than
to the south, where the largest amount of LSW is always found on the western boundary.
Furthermore, subpolar overturning is sensitive to the definition of the maximum of the
overturning streamfunction as discussed in §2. Additionally, the net subpolar overturning
strength value is not necessarily reflective of which water masses are found in the lower limb of
the overturning circulation (figure 3). For example, subpolar overturning may be strong because


of high subpolar mode water formation or overflow water export rather than LSW formation. As
the climate warms and water mass formation at high-latitudes changes, it will be important to
examine not only AMOC strength, but also its structure.
