The experimental method which the above investigation proves to be accurate, is
applicable to two-dimensional problems only. In so far as this is the case, its scope
may appear restricted. But when we consider the fact that in the practical applica-
tions of magnetism, the bulk of the phenomena with which we have to deal are of
the two-dimensional order, it will be recognised that it offers a solution of problems
whose interest and importance are by no means inconsiderable. The magnetic field
in and around the armature of a dynamo or alternator, and that in and around
a cylindrical case which is used for purposes of magnetic shielding, are examples
of important practical problems in two dimensions. ON LINES OF INDUCTION IN A MAGNETIC FIRLD.
