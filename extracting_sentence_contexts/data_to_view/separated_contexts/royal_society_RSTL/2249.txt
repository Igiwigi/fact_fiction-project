On each
8ide it receives three columns from the cerebrum, besides those which come down
from the cerebellum, under the name of corpora restiformia, to form its posterior
part, and these columns enter into relations which do not exist, aboye. Decussation of the Posterior or Sensitive Part. We have noticed a fact of more than ordinary importance as reconciling the occur-
rence of symptoms, with our knowledge of anatomy. Where the posterior tract, de-
scending from the cerebrum, has reached the point of the medulla oblongata, just op-
posite to the decussation of the corpora pyramidalia on the fore part, we described a
coalescence, We have already stated, that when we proceed to separate the columns
on the sides of the slit called calamus scriptorius, we see small, neat, and regular fila-
ments, as it were, interlacing and joining the two columns. But when we examine
farther, we perceive that these filaments belong to a plate of fibrous texture which
passes in the central plane from before backwards (Plate XX. fig.
