tenſion of the pulſe.

Now, this obſervation ſeems not eafily reconcile-
able to another of Dr. Horſeburgh, in the place
above-mentioned, on the Hartfell ſpaw (a much
ſtronger and harſher chalybeate than either the Ger-
man ſpaw, or any of our ordinary chalybeates), viz,
that it hath actually been given, with notable ſucceſs,
from half a pint to a pint a day, in conſumptions of
the lungs, far advanced, even attended with heCtic
heats and night ſweats.

So memorable a fact, in the cure of a deplorable
diſeaſe, deſerves attention ; and the Scotch phyſicians
in that neighbourhood are called upon to corroborate
it by further obſervations ; as how long thoſe cures
ſtood, and how far they may have been confirmed by
the like ſucceſs in ſimilar caſes; whether uſed with or
without milk ; and laſtly, whether, as an acid auſtere

_medicine, they may cool, correct, and give a better
conſiſtence, in a colliquative ſtate of the blood ; ſeerns
well to deſerve further inquiry, and that the reſult
ſhould be communicated for the public utility.
