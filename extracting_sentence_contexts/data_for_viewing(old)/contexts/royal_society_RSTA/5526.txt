3. Structured domains

We now discuss reaction-transport systems on spatial domains 2 which are not simple subsets
of Euclidean spaces. In particular, we focus on manifolds, networks, and multi-domain models.
The first two can be thought of as examples of the generalized linear instability analysis given
in §2b (at least in the case of undirected networks), whereas the latter will involve less obvious
generalizations of the classical theory.

(a) Curved manifolds

The study of reaction-transport systems on curved manifolds goes back to Turing’s paper
[1], where he employed spherical harmonics to discuss a hypothetical mechanism behind
gastrulation. In fact, much of Turing’s paper uses spherical symmetry as a major discussion point
for why symmetry breaking instabilities must play a role in development.

Hunding pursued this symmetry breaking question in the context of reaction-diffusion
systems defined inside spheres and prolate ellipsoids [31,32], though the curvature of the domain
here was restricted to its boundary. Varea et al. studied a reaction—diffusion system on the surface
of a sphere numerically, finding striking symmetries in the emergent patterns [33]. Chaplain et al.
developed a numerical method to study a reaction—diffusion system on the surface of the sphere
[34] using an expansion of the solution in terms of spherical harmonics. They postulated that
such pattern-forming systems may play a role in determining how tumour spheroids grow and
develop.

To model diffusion on surfaces and curved domains beyond simple curvilinear examples, one
