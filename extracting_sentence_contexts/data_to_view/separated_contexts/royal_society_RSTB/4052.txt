BARCROFT AND TOYOJIRO KATO ON EFFECTS OF FUNCTIONAL

The curve of oxidation in Experiment 3 is shown in fig. 9, together with the rate
of flow of saliva. It will be seen to have two maxima, one shortly after (within

10 minutes of the injection of the pilocarpine), the other about an hour and a half

subsequently. The actual presence of the second summit, whilst interesting enough
in itself, is less important than the fact that the coefficient of oxidation rises steadily
as compared to the amount of saliva secreted per minute, throughout the whole

course of the experiment, as is shown in fig. Ll. ACTIVITY IN STRIATED MUSCLE AND THE SUBMAXILLARY GLAND. 171
