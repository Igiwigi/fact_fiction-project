those of classical statistical physics. The corresponding models are statistically predictive, rather
than representational. Models of analytical mechanics, or of chaos and complexity theories are
representational, but they are not, in general, visualizable, although some computer models
provide partial visualizations of such models, as in the case of chaos theory, famous for these
computer images. However, in all of these cases, the individual behaviour of the ultimate
constitutive objects from which the behaviour of these systems emerges is represented by the
model of classical mechanics and, as such, is at least locally or infinitesimally visualizable, even
though this visualization may be approximate.

In classical mechanics, this visualization is essentially connected to the possibility of ideally
representing the motion of classical objects by means of differential calculus, which reflects
this geometrical visualization of the continuous or, more accurately, differential motion, along
a straight or curved trajectory, of an object. In fact, this motion, again, at the level of this
idealized model, can be considered as infinitesimally linear, which circumstance led Newton to
the invention of calculus, although he was compelled to recast his argument, initially developed
via calculus, in terms of Euclidean geometry in Principia [20]. One can, literally, draw a picture
of such motion (as a small curve with a tangent vector as a given point on it) on a blackboard,
actual or that in our mind, which makes these models more descriptive. From this perspective,
visualization is in effect equivalent to the applicability of the concept of classical motion as
infinitesimally represented by differential functions of time and coordinates.

This representation implies that position and the velocity (or momentum) are both defined
at any moment of time and, hence, such a representation is impossible in the case of quantum
objects, due to the uncertainty relations. In the present view, no representation of their behaviour,
either as continuous (or differential) or discrete, by any means is possible, even in the case
