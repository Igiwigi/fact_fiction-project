In this connection it is suggestive to notice that the state of regression of the inter-
stitital tissue at which the animal passes into Stage V, varies with the temperature. In the fish in their natural habitat the state of regression of the interstitial tissue at
Stage V varies, and in some cases the interstitial tissue is but a little fibrous. On the
other hand, in Experiment ITI, the interstitial tissue was markedly reduced when the
fish were in Stage V.

Taking these considerations with the facts known in mammalia (Lirscuurz, 1924),
it will be seen that the duration of the secondary sexual characters of Gasterosteus is
dependent on the continuance of the interstitial hormone, and that the rate of regression
of these characters after the supply of interstitial hormone has ceased is directly variable
with the temperature of the fish. General Review of the Reproductive Cycle. The attainment of sexual maturity by the young fish depends on both its size and
the temperature of the habitat (p. 258).
