considered as of other kinds. But &till those attractions and repulsions are
exactly of the same nature as those already referred to under the head Tension,
Yoltaic electricity 268.) ; and the difference in degree between them is not
greater than often occurs between cases of ordinary electricity only. I think
it will be unnecessary to enter minutely into the proofs of the identity of this
character in the two instances. They are abundant ; are generally admitted as
good ; and lie upon the surface of the subject : and whenever in other parts of
the comparison I am about to draw, a similar case occurs, I shall content my-
self with a mere announcement of the similarity, expanding only upon those
parts where the great question of distinction or identity is still controverted.

286. The discharge of common electricity through heated air is a well-known
fact. The parallel case of voltaic electricity has already been described
(272, &e.).

287. In motion. i. Evolution of heat. 'The heating power of common electri-
city when passed through wires or other substances, is perfectly well known.
The accordance between it and voltaic electricity is in this respect complete.
Mr. Harms has constructed and described* a very beautiful and sensible in-
strument on this principle, in which the heat produced in a wire by the dis-
charge of a mere spark of common electricity is readily shown, and to which I
