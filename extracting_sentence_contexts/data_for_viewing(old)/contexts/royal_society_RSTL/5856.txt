* The dew-point exhibits greater variations still, amounting on Guajara to 349 against
1*-4 at the sea-level, and on Alta Vista to 40*%:1 against 13*6 at the lower level for the
- ame period.
'These variations of daily means exhibit inexplicable discordances, in no small measure
m account of s0 small a portion of their cycle, viz. the year, being included in the
\bservations ; and before coming to the consideration of the absolute quantities for each
lay, it may be well to consider the monthly variations.

(3.) Monthly Means.

On taking the arithmetical means, the results indicated by the curves were powerfully
Yutirmed, viz. that on the mountain, the maxima of temperature and dryness are earlier
San below; summer, in fact, at a great height, is there nearly coincident with the
Blstice. Thus while at the sea-level the temperature went on increasing throughont
Bly, August, and September, it was sensibly decreasing at Guajara in July and Angust ;
= at Alta Vista, in August and September, it was very rapidly falling. On going
Wow the sea-level, or to the sea-water itself, the law was carried on further still., the
Smbers being as follows :—
