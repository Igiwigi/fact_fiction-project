It must be borne in mind that these are independent investigations, excepting that
the figures in columns G. & H., and W., are mostly dependent on the same material. The observations in England were nearly all made at or after sunset, so that solar
radiation is excluded; they were also made with an entirely different type of
instrument, and refer to a different period. The observations on the Continent were
made in the morning; about 8 or 9 a.m. would, perhaps, be a fair average. (With
regard to the greater range on the Continent, see p. 261, line 5.)

The following facts appear from the tables. The temperature decreases steadily up
to a height of about 10 or 11 km. (9 or 10 km. at Pawlowsk), and remains almost
stationary above that height. The annual range decreases from the surface up to
2 or 3 km.; it then continues nearly constant, with perhaps a small increase at
7 or 8 km., up to about 11 km., at which point it is abruptly reduced to less than half
its former value.
