PROFESSOR TYNDALL'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO MOLECULAR PHYSICS. 367

'The reasoning just employed leads to the inference that those molecules which expe-
rience most resistance from the ether, must be the least competent to transfer the motion
of heat, from one to the other. The direct power of communication is enfeebled by the
ether, and the motion obtained indirectly cannot make good the loss. We are thus led
to the conclusion that the best radiators ought to prove themselves the worst con-
ductors.

A broad consideration of the subject shows that the conclusion is in general harmony
with observed facts. Organic substances are all exceedingly imperfect conductors of
heat, and they are all excellent radiators. The moment we pass from the metals to
their compounds we pass from a series of good conductors to bad ones, and from a series
of bad radiators to good ones®.

In the earlier memoirs of MM. Ds LE ProvyosTarE and DE8AINSF, and in that of MM.
WIEDEMANN and FRAxz, T find the following facts :—The radiative power of platinum is
five times that of silver; its conductive power is one-tenth that of silver. Platinum has
more than twice the radiative power of gold; it has only one-seventh of the conducting-
power. Zinc and tin are almost equal as conductors, and they are also nearly equal as
radiators. Silver has about six times the conductive power of zinc and tin ; it has only
one-fourth of their radiative powers. Brass possesses but one-half the radiative energy
of platinum; it possesses more than twice its conductivity. Other experiments of
