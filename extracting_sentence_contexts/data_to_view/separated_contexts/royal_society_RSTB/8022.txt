The sand is thought to be essentially 7m situ and genetically
related to the underlying laterite. The laterite in the district formed on a dissected surface of fairly well-marked relief, not
on a low-lying peneplain as supposed by previous authors. This is shown by the fact that
the laterite dips towards present-day river valleys at up to 10Â° and also shows a continuous
variation in elevation from 210 to 863 ft. above sea-level. A deep zone of alteration exists below the laterite itself. The pre-Cambrian rocks are
completely kaolinized to depths of 100 ft. or more.
