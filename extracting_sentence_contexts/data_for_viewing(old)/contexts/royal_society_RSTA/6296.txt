taken as evidence for rejecting the axiom of choice as constructively valid. However, showing that
a certain instance of excluded middle is not constructively valid is not sufficient for ensuring that
only principles of intuitionistic logic are satisfied. After all, there could be intermediate principles
that are derivable in T. Dick de Jongh was the first to investigate this phenomenon: in his doctoral
dissertation [3], he showed that the propositional principles valid in Heyting arithmetic (HA)
under all substitutions are exactly those of propositional intuitionistic logic (IPC). This fact is now
known as de Jongh’s theorem and has sparked fruitful investigations into the logical structure of
intuitionistic arithmetic. A generalization of de Jongh’s theorem would be to consider not only
the propositional principles of HA but also its propositional admissible rules (see definition 2.3).
Visser [4] showed that the propositional admissible rules of HA are exactly those of IPC. A further
generalization would be to consider the two notions in the setting of predicate logic.

In this article, we survey results about the logical structure of constructive set theories and also
provide a few new results in the area as well as questions for future research.

The study of the logical properties of classical and non-classical theories goes back at least

several decades. Early results on the logics of theories date from the 1970s, and Rybakov’s seminal : =
