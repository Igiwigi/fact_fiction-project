In like manner as ruminants have only teeth in the
under jaw, 80 has the goose 8mall pointed cuticular teeth in
the lower portion of the bill, which, when the bill is closed,
fit into grooves in the upper one, $0 that the grass inclosed
in the space between the teeth and grooves, is nipped off;

and mixed with the secretions poured out by the glandular
surfaces surrounding it, in this respect corresponding to the
first and second stomach of ruminating animals, in which the
grass is prepared for mastication. These facts, as they account for the goose and swan living
upon a species of food not fitted for birds in general, proves
that in this class of animals, a peculiar conformation of the
digestive organs is required, as well as in quadrupeds, when
they are intended by nature to live intirely upon grass. This fact being ascertained, is not without its importance in
elucidating this branch of physiological inquiry. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE. Fig. 1.
