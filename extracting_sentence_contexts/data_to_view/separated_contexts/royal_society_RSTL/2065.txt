If the moving plate be circular, and if the mag-
net be-suspended in a balance of torsion, this extremely
small tendency of each part to drag the pole N in the direc-
tion of its motion being repeatedly applied by each succeeding
particle, and during many revolutions, may at last produce
motion in, the «magnets above, even though the attractive
force of the revolving substance be 80 exceedingly feeble as
to be insensible to other methods. In this 'analysis of the action of a magnet on a moving
body susceptible of magnetism, it is to be observed, that no
part of the effect.is attributed to the velocity with which the
agent* immediately producing the attraction traverses from
the former to the latter: the nature of the action is not

®* It is difficult to write on any physical subject without employing words which
are more or less connected with the various hypotheses prevailing at the time. In
the present Paper I have no intention of giving any opinion on the theories at

Teasonings to which they appear to me to lead.


and magnetic rotations. 497

therefore analogous to that which produces the aberration of
light. The essential circumstance in producing the rotation of the
suspended magnet is, that the substance revolving below it
shall acquire and lose its magnetism in a finite time, and
not instantly. It appeared, therefore, . that if, any other
attractive or repulsive property exists in 'matter - which is
capable of communication to, other, matter situated near it ;
and if such communication require: time for its performance ;
and if, when it is communicated, the force is not instantly
annihilated on removing the cause, then such a property of
matter may be substituted in the preceding reasoning instead
of magnetism, the same deductions may be made, and similar
consequences may be expected to result.
