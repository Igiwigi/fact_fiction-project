Facts analogous to these were announced, in the autumn
of last year, by Professor DoprrxINER of Jena, with this ad-
ditional and striking circumstance, that when platinum in a
spongy form is introduced into an explosive mixture of oxy-
gen and hydrogen, the metal, even though its temperature
had not been previously raised, immediately glows, and
causes the union of the two gases to take place, sometimes
sllently, at others with detonation. It is remarkable, how-
