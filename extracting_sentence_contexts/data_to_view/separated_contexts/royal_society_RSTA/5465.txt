This is particularly evident for the
second-order MF cumulant C2, and for the first two indices of the non-Gaussian expansion (i.e. LQ1 and LQ2), suggesting that major differences are associated with the nonlinear dynamics
features of HRV and EEG parameter dynamics. This hypothesis is further supported by the
fact that the first-order MF cumulant (C1), which stems from linear behaviour in the time
domain, detected few significant BHI differences associated with HRV linear dynamics frequency
quantifiers. Of note, first and third non-Gaussian MF indexes (i.e. LQ1 and LQ3) show differences
in the RR- and HR-variance.
