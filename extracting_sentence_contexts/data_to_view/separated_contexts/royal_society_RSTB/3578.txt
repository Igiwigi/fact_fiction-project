é Methods. . After prolonged trial observations on various Annelids I decided that, of these,
Halla afforded the best opportunities for the investigation of the giant cells and
giant fibres. Preparations were made according to the method of Gotat, but without
the least success, a result identical with that obtained by von Lennosskx, Reratus
(see p. 440), and, in fact, everyone who has attempted to investigate these elements
by this method. Various methods of preservation and staining were tried in the hope
of obtaining a clear differentiation of the elusive fibrill in these remarkable elements,
but for a period of nearly five years without any really satisfactory result. I devoted
much time while in Naples, in 1900 and again in 1906, to the iéra-vitam staining
of specimens of Halla, or portions of its nerve cord, with methylene blue, but this
treatment proved totally ineffectual, although numerous modifications were made in
regard to the strength of the solution employed and its mode of application.
