tive to the air, and the air’s velocity relative to the ground,
so we may write the identity dx/dt=U+W, where
W = W(x(t), t) is the local wind velocity (figure 1). Differen-
tiating with respect to time and rearranging yields the
new identity dU/dt = d°x/d# — dW/dt. Substituting both
identities into equation (2.2) and rearranging, we have

dE dx dw
SF = [meme] tr gw — mu (2.3)

Equation (2.3) captures all of the mechanical energy flows
associated with soaring flight, and it can be rewritten using
only scalar quantities by making use of the fact that the
scalar product of two vectors is equal to the magnitude
of one vector multiplied by the magnitude of the other's
projection onto it.

By Newton’s second law, the square brackets in equation
(2.3) comprise the total force acting on the bird (md?x/dt?)
minus its body weight (mg). This is equal to the total aerody-
namic force, of which only the component acting in the
direction of the bird’s air velocity (U) can contribute to the
first scalar product. As this component is equal to the net for-
wards aerodynamic force of thrust T= T(U) minus drag
D=D(U), we may rewrite the first scalar product as
