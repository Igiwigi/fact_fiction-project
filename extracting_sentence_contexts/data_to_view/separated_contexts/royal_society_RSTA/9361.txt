The earlier period of seven years,
though longer than that available at most observatories, was too short to give a
satisfactorily representative presentation of some of the phenomena. To obtain results
fairly characteristic of the locality many years data are required of some of the
meteorological elements, especially barometric pressure and rainfall. For the latter
element, in fact, a considerably longer period is desirable than that available even now
for potential gradient at Kew. The same may be true of potential gradient itself, but
various reasons exist for not waiting longer. Owing to building operations, the
electrograph results for 1913 were exposed to special uncertainties.
