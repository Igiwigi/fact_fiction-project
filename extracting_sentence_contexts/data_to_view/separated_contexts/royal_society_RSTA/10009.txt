From this equation & may be calculated if an approximate value of it is known and
is substituted in the hyperbolic functions which involve it. In the experiments to be
described these functions have values not differing greatly from unity. A sufficiently
close approximation to the value of k for this substitution may, in fact, be found by

The effect of temperature on the dimensions of the rods is neglected, as it does
not appear likely to influence the value of the conductivity found by so much as
1 part in 300. In the actual apparatus the heat was supplied to the rod by the passage of the
electric current through a platinoid wire wound on an independent sleeve placed on
the bar, and the temperatures were measured by the resistances of platinum wires
wound on similar sleeves.* It is therefore necessary to determine the effect of the
sleeves on the result previously given. Effect of the Sleeves.
