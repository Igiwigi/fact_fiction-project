time-lag in augmenting the work spent in magnetic reversals is conspicuous, and here,
again, it is remarkable how great this influence is at very moderate speeds of reversal.
The exact form which the curve takes at any assigned speed will, of course, depend
on what particular function of the time the applied electromotive force is caused to be,
as a consequence of the exact form of the commutator plates and other conditions of
the experiment. In the present case it appeared that the applied electromotive
foree was made to vary rather quicker near its mean values and rather less quick
near its extreme values than would have been the case had it been a simple harmonic
function of the time.
Tt is noticeable that the area of the curve increases at first and finally decreases as
the frequency is increased. In other words, with a given maximum of magnetizing
current the work expended in reversals is a maximum, per cycle, for some one
frequency. This, of course, results from the fact that at higher frequencies the
magnetization fails to penetrate sufficiently into the interior of the bar.
In steel these phenomena are much less apparent than in soft iron, but they take
Place to some extent. Fig. 34 shows the results of a similar experiment made with
a pair of bars of tool steel of the same dimensions as the iron rods of fig. 33. Here
again (a) shows the effects of perfectly slow reversal, while (b) and (c) are cycles
performed in periods of 3 seconds and 0°6 second respectively. In both of these
experiments (figs. 33 and 34) the cycles marked (b) and (c) were produced by using
n electric motor to drive the commutator, regularity of speed being essential to
steadiness of the figure, especially at the slower speeds.
Whether these manifestations of time-lag in magnetization are entirely explicable
