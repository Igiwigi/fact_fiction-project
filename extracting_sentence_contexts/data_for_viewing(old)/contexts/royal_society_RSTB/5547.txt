their positions considerably. For instance, the posterior arms of the tentorium, which
undoubtedly arise immediately behind the maxilla, as fig. 56 clearly shows, ultimately
find themselves in a position posterior to the labium (fig. 57). It must surely be move-
ments of this kind, which account for the difference of opinion related above as to the
segmental or intersegmental positions of the tentorial invaginations,

The cephalic spiracle, discovered by Nexson in Apis in front of the second maxilla,
must be considered here. He describes it as belonging to the second maxilla. I have

already pointed out its close similarity, on account of position and the fact that it loses
its hypodermal connection, to the hypostigmatic gland in both Bombyx and Pieris.
The above-mentioned embryologists who homologised tentorial and silk gland invagina-
tions with spiracles contended that the anterior tentorial arms represented an original
first spiracle and the posterior tentorial arms of the second maxillary segment corre-
sponded to the third pair of spiracles. The additional pair of spiracles on this same
segment in Apis precludes Netson from maintaining the homology suggested by
Patmen (1877), HarscHex (1877), and Carriere and Bireer (1898), viz., between
tentoria and spiracles. This, however, does not prevent us from employing the cephalic
invaginations in a determination of head segmentation.

The following is my interpretation of the cephalic invaginations. In view of the fact
that all investigators are in agreement as to the origin of the main invaginations from
