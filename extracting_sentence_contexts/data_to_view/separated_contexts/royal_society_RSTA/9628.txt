The lattice
function was also exhibited as a sum of sub-lattice functions, and it was shown that
the generating function, when the part magnitude is restricted, may be expressed as
a linear function of them. These sub-lattice functions are intrinsically interesting,
but it will be shown in what follows that they are not of vital importance to the
investigation. In fact, the difficulty of constructing them has been turned by the
