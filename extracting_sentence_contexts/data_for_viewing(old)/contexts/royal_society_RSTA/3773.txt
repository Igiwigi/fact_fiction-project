5. Conclusion | |

We have theoretically and numerically demonstrated that ENZ media can be used to induce
strong magnetic field inhomogeneities in neighbouring dielectrics, and, in turn, generate strong :f
magnetic field concentrations. In fact, the magnetic field magnitude enhancement factor is in is
theory unbounded, and it is thus in principle possible to obtain arbitrarily large enhancement :
factors as the size of the ENZ body increases. Naturally, this process is limited in practice by
the presence of dissipation losses. However, numerical simulations reveal that the magnetic field
enhancement at the zeroth-order (1 =0) resonance of a circular dielectric rod can be increased by
one order of magnitude with moderate losses (£, = i0.01—i0.03). We emphasize that, although the

zeroth-order (1 =0) resonance of a dielectric rod has been taken as a case study, the mechanism lo
presented here is completely general, and the performance of many other dielectric resonators Ss
may be enhanced when immersed in an ENZ host. This might include, for example, dielectric rods : =
with different cross-sectional shapes, multilayered rods and higher-order modes [65]. Indeed, : =
the generation of large field inhomogeneities is an intrinsic property of ENZ media, associated 1B
with an effective enlargement of the wavelength. Moreover, the occurrence of this resonant : =
