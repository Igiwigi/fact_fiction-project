DSMC are both widely documented in the literature, the reader should refer to [22,23], which
represent the reference for the DSMC and LB methods, respectively. Although both DSMC
and LB bear strong links to the Boltzmann kinetic equation, they show major differences in
purpose and mathematical structure. Indeed, while DSMC is poised to solve the actual Boltzmann
equation by retaining microscopic realism, the LB was initially devised to retain only the
symmetry/conservation constraints required to reproduce the hydrodynamic equations in the
low-Knudsen-number hydrodynamic limit. Thus, LB could be regarded as a Navier-Stokes solver
in kinetic vests. It is only recently that higher-order versions of the LB method (LBM) have
been developed, which prove capable of capturing (some) non-equilibrium effects beyond the
hydrodynamic picture [24-26], but such higher-order versions are not relevant to this work.
The main feature that distinguishes the LB from the DSMC is the coarse graining operated at
the level of the microscopic velocity space, as the degrees of freedom of the velocity space itself
are largely reduced. In fact, while, in LB, probability distributions at each lattice site x are allowed
to propagate only along a finite set of directions with an assigned speed &,, in DSMC particles are
grid-free.
