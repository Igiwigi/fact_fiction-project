examination of the contact and by sections of the underlying tissue. We obtain
early and prominent extrinsic deflections in this region of the heart, but the onset of
the intrinsic deflection is late, and occurs from 0°0317 to 0°0442 second after its
appearance at the S-A node (‘Table VII).* Measuring the distances between the
nodes along the septum and estimating the conduction rate to A—V nodal region,
we can discover no material divergence between conduction to this region and to
the remainder of the auricular walls and septum. We think that this result is a
natural one, for we lead, not from A--V node itself, but from septal muscle overlying
it. It is not possible to place a contact upon the node itself, this structure being
buried. Nevertheless, if the node received the excitation wave by some special path
and this wave spread immediately to the surrounding auricular muscle, as Eystrr and
MEEK (3) suppose, then we should anticipate an early appearance of the wave in the
region from which we lead. As a matter of fact we fail to find it. But this negative
answer does not entirely preclude a quick line of conduction, for it is conceivable that
there may be no spread to auricle from A-V node but only spread to ventricle once
the excitation wave has reached the node. Having this in mind, we have used an
entirely different method of estimating the transmission interval between the two
nodes. Ifa lead tube, through which iced water may be conveyed, is laid along the
whole line of the sulcus and well in contact with it, upon cooling the sulcus the
rhythm of the heart alters and the pacemaker is transferred from Sd node to A-V
node, and auricle and ventricle beat simultaneously. But at the transition there are
contractions of the auricle of a peculiar kind (fig. 17). The rate of the S-A rhythm

* A control S.A.N. lead was always taken after the introduction of the internal contacts.
