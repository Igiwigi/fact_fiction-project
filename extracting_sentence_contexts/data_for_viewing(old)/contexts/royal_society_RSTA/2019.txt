step of 0.025 ms. The diffusion tensor D(x) incorporates information about the orientation of fibres.
Here, we use a simplified geometry in which fibres are oriented along a primary axis in planes
parallel to the epicardial and endocardial surfaces that rotates linearly with tissue depth [19],
with the total rotation 60Â° except when noted otherwise. Wave propagation is fastest along the
fibre direction, leading to anisotropic conduction. Along the fibres, the diffusion coefficient is
0.001 cm2 ms! ; in all other directions, it is 0.0002 cm? ms). Spiral waves were initiated using a
cross-field protocol and stacked to produce a scroll wave with a transmural filament.

(b) Data assimilation

Data assimilation is the process of estimating the state of a complex system by combining a prior
estimate of the system state with new observations of the system to yield a more accurate state
representation. There are many methods of data assimilation, and, in fact, state estimation has
been used by other groups for cardiac cells and small one-dimensional tissues [54,55] as well as
two-dimensional tissue with optical mapping data [56]. Here, we build on our previous work
using a variation on the ensemble Kalman filter, the local ensemble transform Kalman filter
(LETKF) [57], which is particularly well suited for large three-dimensional domains.

The LETKF is one of the class of ensemble Kalman filters (EnKFs). EnKFs and variational
methods, such as three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) and four-dimensional variational
(4DVAR), are the two most popular classes of data-assimilation methods in use for large
domains in the atmospheric and oceanic communities [58,59]. Studies have compared 4DVAR and
LETKF in simple chaotic systems such as the Lorenz 40 variable model and a quasi-geostrophic
atmospheric model and have found that both methods have comparable average analysis and
forecast errors as long as certain analysis intervals are used [60,61]. Similar performance has
