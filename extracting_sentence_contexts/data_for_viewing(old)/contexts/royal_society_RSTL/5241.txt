from additions to the surface, by a process somewhat similar to that through which the growth of bone is effected.
This process will be described when the latter subject is considered.


STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. 125

in single file. | It does not appear that the number of cells entering into the formation
of a series is at all limited; hence the lines or columns vary in length. Neither
does it appear that the consecutive lines are placed, as a rule, end to end, 80 as to
form one long continuous straight line by the junction of several shorter ones. On
the contrary, each series is complete in itself, and is generally placed a little to the
one or other side of those above and below it. We have in fact interrupted lines of
cells, each line the offspring of a single cell, the outer walls of which have merged
into the intercellular or hyaline tissue.

When the destined number of cells forming a linear series has been developed,
each cell becomes itself a centre of growth. The granular cell enlarges, together with
its nucleus, and becomes invested with a cell-wall. In examining a line of these
bodies extending from the forming bone of the diaphysis, we shall see them in various
degrees of forwardness. Thus, if attention be directed to the end of the line furthest
from the bone, the cells will be found small in size, granular, and with a perceptible
nucleus, but without an outer wall, distinguishable from the hyaline substance, which
is abundant between the contiguous lines, but small in quantity between the cells
composing the lines. But if the other end of the line be examined, very different
