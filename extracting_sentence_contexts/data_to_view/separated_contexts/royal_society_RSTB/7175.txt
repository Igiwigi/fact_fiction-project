The glandular cells of the functional spermatheca secrete a fluid into its cavity, and the
other epithelial cells lay down the inner cuticular lining. Similar glandular cells to those
of the spermatheca proper appear on the middle portion of the spermathecal duct. Owing
to the fact that the duct is surrounded by a layer of longitudinal muscle these glandular
cells are separated from the lining epithelial cells as the mulberry-like structure described
in the adult. The caecus. The caecal invagination extends deeply during the pupal stage until its lobes
reach the sixth abdominal segments.
