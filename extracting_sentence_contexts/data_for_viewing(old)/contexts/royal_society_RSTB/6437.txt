and ovulation followed by pseudo-pregnancy produced. The stimulus was equally
effective whether applied through the brain or through the lumbo-sacral part of the
cord. In a few animals, however, haemorrhagic follicles were produced instead of
corpora lutea, but it is to be observed that this also often happens after injecting
anterior pituitary-like principles. Further, ovulation did not supervene until 17 to
24 hours later instead of the usual interval of 10 hours, and pseudo-pregnancy might
be a day or two shorter than usual. It is clear, however, that an electrical stimulus
could switch the cycle over from the oestrous to the luteal phase. FRimpcoop and
Pincus (1935) found that ovulation could supervene after stimulation of the cervical
sympathetic ganglia, but, as in our experiments, there was a delay of 12 to 14 hours
beyond the normal interval, the result in this respect being in agreement with our
observations. FrrepGoop and Prncus’s experiments are remarkable in view of the
fact recorded above that ovulation can occur in the rabbit after complete cervical
sympathectomy. One may, perhaps, interpret the results on the assumption of
more than one nervous path and more than one mechanism for the initiation of the
processes. Harerrus (1934), however, could not produce ovulation after cervical
sympathetic stimulation.

Harris (1936, B) has succeeded in producing ovulation in the rabbit and ferret
after local stimulation of the hypothalamus, but it is just possible that the effect was
due to an extension of the stimulus to nerve endings in the pituitary itself. There
was a long delay—30 to 40 hours, before ovulation occurred, and in some cases
instead of ovulation taking place haemorrhagic follicles were formed or luteal tissue
without the discharge of the ovum, in just the same way as often happens after the
injection of anterior pituitary-like principles.
