agency) are engendered in the cingulate cortex; this congruence
is also consonant with the definition of an emotion as the
combination of a feeling and a concurrent motivation that is
accompanied by obligatory autonomic sequelae [24]. This
suggests that affective feelings from the body and their conjoint
motivations and autonomic effects can be viewed as emotions
that signal adaptive homeostatic responses to the needs of our
body, or homeostatic emotions [10]. (The ‘primordial emotions’
of Denton [25] are conceptually similar; see also [26].) From
this perspective, emotional feelings and their concomitant
motivations signal adaptive responses to needs that are rep-
resented by patterns of activity in the brain, which correspond
with social, cognitive, or fictive circumstances. In all instances,
such adaptive responses flexibly balance anticipated outcomes
(based on hereditary and learned associations encoded in the
sensorimotor hierarchy) with the optimal utilization of energy,
which is the critical evolutionary and homeostatic arbiter.

Temperature sensation provides a good example of a
homeostatic emotion. We normally regard this as a discrimina-
tive cutaneous sensory capacity. However, with each thermal
sensation we feel an obligatory hedonic affect (pleasantness
or unpleasantness, unless neutral), and that affective feeling
occurs along with a behavioural thermoregulatory motivation,
which guides an adaptive, energy-efficient response to an
