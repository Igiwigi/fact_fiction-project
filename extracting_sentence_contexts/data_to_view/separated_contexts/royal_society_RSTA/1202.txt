Complex valued functions

(a) The semigroup in G(R")

As usual, C;(R) and all its subspaces are endowed with the sup norm || - ||oo-

Since gr is continuous, by (2.6) we see that T(t) maps L®(RY) into Cy(RY), and therefore it is
a strong Feller semigroup. However, it is not strongly continuous even in BUC(RN) unless B= 0. Indeed, given any f € BUC(RN), using the fact that lim;_.9 Jtyiesy gly) dy =0 for every 6 > 0, it is
easily seen that

Jim ITF — fle JIloo =0 (3.1)

and therefore we have

jim ITF ~filoo =0

if and only if
lim f(e!B x) —f(x)|=0 uniformly for x € RN, (3.2)

see [6, Lemma 3.2]. For N =1 and B = 1, a counterexample to strong continuity is thus provided
by f(x) =sinx € BUC(R). In fact, f(e'-) does not converge uniformly to f as > 0.
