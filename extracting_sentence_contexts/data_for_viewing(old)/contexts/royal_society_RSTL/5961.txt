the reproductive organs themselves. 'The author begs therefore to offer the succeeding
description as drawn exclusively from his own researches.

In every Nereid, the ciliated, looped, horseshoe organ to which the author has applied
the name of the © segmental organ,” exists without, a single exception.

The demonstration of this organ in Nereis margaritacen is attended by great difficulty.
It can only be accomplished either by the tedious process of placing annular sections of
the body under the microscope, or by the discovery of a young specimen at that age at
which the integuments are transparent ; and then it is only in the region of the tail of
the worm that the ciliated organ becomes visible to the eye. In MN. margaritacea it

* STANN1Us and Dy QvaTREFAGEs have already pointed out the fact that the gexes were seated on 8ePAa-
rate individuals in the Sabellide ; but it is evident from the following passage, that D& QuaTREFAaGes has
altogether overlooked the real ovaria and testes of these Annelids, and mistaken for them the TNAS8C8,
attached to them, of the ova and sperm-cells. He 8ays in his exsay, * Sur les Hermelliens ”* (Ann. d. Sc.
Nat. 1848, &. 10. p. 46) : © Le testicule consiste en une 8orte de trame ardolaire d'une t6&nuit6 extreme, qui
part de Vapon&vrose mediane,” &e.. . . « L'ovaire est en tout; semblable au testicule.” Dx QUATREFAGES
then states that these organs are temporary, and, after the ova and the sperm-cells pass into the general

cavity, they disappear through atrophy. Tt will be seen how entirely the results stated in the text differ
from those published by the French naturalist.
