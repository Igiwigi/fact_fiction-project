INFLUENCE OF PROPORTIONS IN ELECTROLYTES. 83

with strong sulphuric acid, was found to conduct and decompose slowly. But on
examination there were strong reasons for believing that water was present, and that
the decomposition and conduction depended upon it. I endeayoured to prepare a
perfectly anhydrous portion, but could not spare the time required to procure an un-
exceptionable result.

685. Nitric acid is a substance which I believe is not decomposed directly by
the electric current. As I want the facts in illustration of the distinction existing
between primary and secondary decomposition, I will merely refer to them in this
place (752.).

686. That these mineral acids should confer facility of conduction and decompo-
sition on water, is no proof that they are competent to favour and suffer these ac-
tions in themselves. Boracic acid does the same thing, though not decomposable.
M. Ds 1a Rivs has pointed out that chlorine has this power also ; but being to us an
elementary substance, it cannot be due to its capability of suffering decomposition.

687. Chloride of $ulphur does not conduct, nor is it decomposed. It consists of
single proportionals of its elements, but is not on that account an exception to the
rule (679.), which does not affirm that a// compounds of single proportionals of ele-
