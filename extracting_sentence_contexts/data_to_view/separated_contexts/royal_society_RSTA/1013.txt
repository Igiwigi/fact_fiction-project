Therefore, the problem was reduced to finding only one coefficient—the rate of growth
of the nuclei. This approach works particularly well for small nuclei. With the growth of large
nuclei, there are a number of limitations connected with the fact that the distribution function
of heterophase fluctuations is determined on the basis of the hypothesis of the homogeneity of
the system surrounding the growing crystallite (in general, gradients of concentration and/or
temperature always exist around the growing nucleus). Summarizing the above, we note that the works of Volmer, Weber, Becker and Déring [6-
8] form the basis of the classical theory of nucleation. Moreover, the equations determining the
growth process are the Fokker—Planck-type equation for the particle-size distribution function
and the mass balance and/or heat balance equation.
