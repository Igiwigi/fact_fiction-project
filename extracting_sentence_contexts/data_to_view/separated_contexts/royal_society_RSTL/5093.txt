In consequence of the absence of stray light, which would otherwise
dazzle the eye, an amount of concentration of the rays can be brought to bear on
the object, which enables the observer to detect excessively minute degrees of sensi-
bility. Thus, when the sun's light is condensed by a rather large lens, and made to

pass through a strong solution of the ammoniaco-sulphate of copper, the condensed
beam of violet and invisible rays seryes to detect fluorescence in almost all fluids. This, however, is no great advantage; the method is in fact too powerful ; and the
observer is left in doubt whether the effect perceived be due to the fluid deemed to
be examined, or to ome impurity which it contains in an amount otherwise perbaps
inappreciable. The great advantage which sunlight observations possess in the
examination of substances, which, however, is only applicable to clear media, is that
they enable the observer to make out the distribution of activity in the incident
spectrum. In some cases this constitutes the chief peculiarity in the mode of fluor-
escence of a particular substance; in other cases it enables the obseryer to see, as it
were, independently of each other, different sensitive substances existing together in
solation.
