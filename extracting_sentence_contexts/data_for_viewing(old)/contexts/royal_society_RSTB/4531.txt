affording me the opportunity for carrying out this research, he showed an unfailing
and kindly interest in the work, which, with his advice and able criticism on difficult
theoretical questions, was quite indispensable tome. Iam also deeply grateful to
him for the privilege of consulting the proofs of the fourth volume of his work on
Fossil Plants, the publication of which is shortly expected.

New Caledonia shares with many other islands in the Pacific the possession of a
large number of endemic species. So far as the Podocarpinew are concerned, PILGER
(1903, p. 36) has already drawn attention to the peculiarities of the New Caledonian
flora, which includes at least nine species of Podocarpinese hitherto recorded only
from that island. With the exception of Acmopyle, all of these plants are being
investigated by Mr. C. P. Durr, of Queen’s College, Cambridge. Mr. Durr was
kind enough to allow me to examine his preparations for comparison—a fact which
helped me considerably in my work on Acmopyle. In particular, I would like to
thank him for allowing me to reproduce in this paper a photograph (Plate 11, fig. 31),
of the stone of a new species of Podocarpus discovered by Prof. Compron in New
Caledonia.

The material of Aemopyle was originally preserved mostly in formalin, but was
subsequently transferred to a mixture of alcohol and glycerine. It consisted of
vegetative shoots bearing twigs with pectinately arranged leaves; a stouter piece of
stem with about twenty well marked growth rings; male cones in two stages of
development ; and over a dozen megastrobili. At the time of collection, March 10,
1914, the ovules had all reached the stage when they contain young embryos at the
ends of the tortuous suspensor tubes; they had evidently received the last year's
