In these specimens, the glandular
part is Â£ of an inch in thickness; from the centre of this gland,
an excretory duct opens into the bag, immediately opposite to
the external orifice. The bag itself is lined with a cuticle, and
thinly set with strong hairs. The facts now produced are sufficient to prove that these bags
have a secretion of their own, the quantity of which varies, ac-
cording to the climate and other circumstances; and there is
no reason for thinking that the tears ever pass into them, the
passage into the nose being unusually free, and the orifices in
the bags, in many species, unfayourably situated for the reception
of the tears. We are at present unacquainted with the use to which the
fAluid secreted in these bags is applied. As amphibious animals, in general, have no glands to supply
the skin with moisture from within, but receive it by coming in

contact with moist substances, it is possible the bags, in the
snake, may be supplied in that manner, and the more 80, as the
cuticular lining appears perlect.
