Owing to the largeness of the correction for
heating by obturator, &c., in the first two series we do not bring the results into the
average, but take the exact corrected figure yielded by the third series as the basis
of our calculations, that is to say, for “ tap-water” the mean value of J for the
interval from 13° ©. to 54°25 C. is 4°1785, or corrected to the interval from 13° C. to
55° C. we have

Jus” = 4°1788. This figure is also entitled to special weight owing to the fact that the thermometer

and the standard resistance and battery of nine standard cells had all been sent

again to the National Physical Laboratory to be re-calibrated, and had been returned

only a few days before this third series of continuous-flow experiments was made,

and that the bridge and mercury thermometer-resistances were also re-calibrated from

the standard for the purpose of this series, In the third series the mean error of a
single observation is +0°0006, and the probable error in the result, so far as it
depends on casual experimental errors, is only +0°0002.
