The surface of spicules which have been changed to crystalline
silica is less eroded than the exterior of those in which the silica is in the condition
of chalcedony. These crystalline spicules frequently exhibit a finely radiate stracture
(Plate 45, fig. 17). The canals of spicules in which the silica is either chalcedonie or erystalline are less
regularly preserved than those of spicules of colloidal siliea, In the majority of
spicules no canal at all is visible, but this probably arises from the fact that the canal
having been infilled with chalcedonic silica of the same character as that of the walls,
cannot, either by ordinary or by polarised light, be distinguished therefrom. In other
instances the canals are infilled with glauconite or with a light-brown or opaque
mineral, not improbably iron peroxide. Not infrequently the solidified canal is dis-
continuous and broken up, and no longer occupies the normal position in the axis of
the spicule, but is deflected to near its outer surface (Plate 42, figs. 3b, 64).
