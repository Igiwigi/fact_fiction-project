In 1920, it was observed that very few Sexuparee were present on Larch-plants of
1-8 years of age in nurseries, while great numbers of these winged forms could be
collected from trees 15 years of age in the immediate vicinity. Reasons for such differences have been ascribed to seasonal variation and to
difference in food obtained by the developing larvee, but as both winged and
wingless forms will arise as offspring of the same parent, and after feeding side
by side on the same leaf’ this explanation becomes obviously doubtful. It is, in fact, practically certain that the differentiation of the two forms takes
place during maturation of the ova within the parent, and that the external
difference does not become apparent until the 3rd stage is reached. An attempt was made to obtain exact figures of the proportions of winged to
wingless individuals by infecting isolated Larch plants with definite numbers of
larve hatching from the eggs of a single Sistens in each case, but through the
transference of the larvee from the plant of their origin to another, such large numbers
failed to develop that the experiment proved unreliable. In 1921, a count of the Sexuparz from two plants of the same age, growing under
similar conditions, was taken.
