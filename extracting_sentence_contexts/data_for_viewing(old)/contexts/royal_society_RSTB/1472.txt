This fact is illustrated by figs. 48, 44,and 45. In this experiment the acceleration
of rhythm was very marked, but though the poisoned solution was perfused three
hours, it is seen that, upon reverting to the normal perfusion, the systole became as
strong and complete as at the commencement of the experiment.

Blood.—The interactions between blood and these higher aldoximes are essentially
the same as those between blood and ethylaldoxime. After addition of the drugs at
ordinary temperatures, the blood darkens in colour more quickly if it be propyl-
aldoxime than is the case with ethylaldoxime, and more quickly still if it be the
isobutyl compound. At the body temperature the change takes place much more
rapidly, In fact, on the addition of isobutylaldoxime to blood at 40° C., the colour
almost immediately darkens. Strong solutions of these two aldoximes also decom-
pose the blood, with extrusion of the colouring matter from the corpuscle. This latter
process can be watched under the microscope, when there is presented the appearance
of the red blood corpuscles shrinking, and so causing the pigment to be squeezed out
in granular lumps.

(Enanthaldoxime again departs somewhat from the current character, and instead
of acting still more powerfully on blood, it produces no change whatever in the blood’s
colour at ordinary temperatures. At 40° C., however, the blood is darkened by
cenanthaldoxime quite as readily as by isobutylaldoxime, or even more so.

In all three cases spectroscopic examination has again shown the dark colour to be
