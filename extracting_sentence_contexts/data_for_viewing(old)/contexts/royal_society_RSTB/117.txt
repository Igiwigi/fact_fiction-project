8 millims. high, about 7 millims. wide distally, and 4 millims, wide proximally. The
proximal surface is flattened to articulate with the lunar portion of the scapho-lunar
bone. The distal surface may have fitted upon the trapezoid or the magnum,
Laterally the bone has two surfaces, separated by a sharp vertical oblique ridge.
The surface on the ulnar side is concave in the vertical antero-posterior direction,
and convex from front to back. The other lateral surface faced towards the second
centrale already described.

I regard these three bones collectively as homologous with the nayiculare in the
tarsus. That bone is situate between the astragalus and the three cuneiform bones
which carry the first three metatarsal bones, so that the nayiculare, originally, may
also have included three ossifications. Since the third central bone in this fossil is
the largest, that fact may help to account for the internal position taken by the
representative ossification in Mammals in which it is still found. This carpus is more
primitive than any Mammalian carpus hitherto known, and, on the whole, better

compared with that of Amphibians and Reptiles. Dr. R. WrepersHeErm, in a paper *
on the central bones in the carpus and tarsus in the Axolotl, shows some remarkable
conditions of the carpus to be developed with age. There are at first three bones in
the proximal row, and four bones in the distal row, though ultimately the latter series
numbers fivet on the left side of the body. Between these rows is the centrale,
at first single, and ultimately represented by two cartilages on one side and three
