ue present paper is occupied with an experimental investigation into the variation
‘of the specific heat at constant volume of carbon dioxide attending change of absolute
‘density. The investigation is in continuation of a previous one,* in which Carbon
Dioxide, Air, and Hydrogen were the subjects of a similar enquiry over low ranges of
Gensity. It appeared to me desirable to extend the observations more especially in
he case of carbon dioxide, because of the extended knowledge we already possess of
hs isothermals, and the fact that its critical temperature is within convenient reach.
Sther physical properties of the gas have also received much attention of recent
Bears. It is also readily procured in a nearly pure state.

= The observations recorded in this paper extend, in the one direction, to densities,

Such that liquid is present at the lower temperature ; and in the other, to a junction
‘With the highest densities of the former paper. A plotting of the new observations
% in satisfactory agreement with the record of the old. It reveals, however, the fact

at the linear nature of the variation of the specific heat with density, deduced from
“the former results, is not truly applicable over the new, much more extended range of
Sbservation. For convenience the chart at the end of this paper embraces the former
