There is another input parameter in the theory, tan 8, which measures
how different the two Higgs doublet in the model are. Once these four parameters are set (and a
sign in the Higgs potential, the sign of the so-called 4 parameter), the model can be matched to
current data on Standard Model particle masses, and the masses of all supersymmetric particles
and the Higgs bosons can be predicted. In fact, the initial equal masses for the supersymmetric
particles split apart because of differing quantum corrections (figure 4). We shall assume the
universal pattern of supersymmetry breaking throughout this article. So far, no direct evidence for supersymmetric particle production at the LHC has been found
(in other words, not enough collisions have been seen which predict high amounts of missing
transverse momentum).
