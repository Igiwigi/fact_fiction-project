The fact is here very clearly (and probably very justly)
related : but, unfortunately, there is nothing, either in the
statement itself, or in the contiguous passages of the work,
that will enable us to determine, with any degree of accuracy,
the exact 7ime wherein this singular phenomenon took place.
And this is the more to be regretted, because the dates of
Several other events, recorded by the same historian, might
be more easily ascertained, if the era of this eclipse were cor-
rectly known ; but which are now involved in much obscurity.

Deprived of all information from the body of the work it-
self, chronologists have called in the aid of astronomy to
assist them in fixing the date of this remarkable appearance.
