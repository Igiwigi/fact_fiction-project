CONSTANT CHARACTER OF THE CURRENT. 159

much more likely to attain the real truth, and from that proceed with as to what
is at present unknown ?

1629. I say these things not, I hope, to advance a particular view, bike to draw the
strict attention of those who are able to investigate and judge of the matter, to what
must be a turning point in the theory of electricity; to a separation of two roads, one
only of which can be right: and I hope I may he allowed to go a little further into
the facts which have driven me to the view I have just given.

1630. When a wire in the voltaic circuit is heated, the temperature frequently
rises first, or most at one end. If this effect were due to any relation of positive or
negative as respects the current, it would be exceedingly important. I therefore ex-
amined several such cases; but when, keeping the contacts of the wire and its position
to neighbouring things unchanged, I altered the direction of the current, I found
that the effect remained unaltered, showing that it depended, not upon the direction
of the current, but on other cireumstances. So there is here no evidence of a dif-
ference between one part of the circuit and another, .

1631. The same point, i. e. uniformity in every part, may be illustrated by what
may be considered as the inexhaustible nature of the current when producing par-
