levels to become double, one level of the doublet being classified as a c level and the
other as a d level. This doubling of the rotational levels is spoken of as A-type doubling.

In a homonuclear molecule, on account of its symmetry properties, alternate levels
have different statistical weights. When, as in O or O*," the nuclear angular momentum
is zero, alternate rotational levels are missing in the *2 state and alternate c and d
levels in the 4/7 state. Fig. 2 shows a diagram of the transition *Y-> 4/7 for O}. In case a
the branches are given by the selection principle AJ = 0, +1, so that altogether 48
branches are to be expected. In case 4, in addition, 4K = 0, +1, so that the total
number of branches is reduced to 27. No attempt has been made to illustrate the
differing intensities of the branches on the diagram. The combination relations which
give certain term differences in the initial and final states can be read off from the heads
of the columns in Tables XIII-XIX. Owing to the fact that alternate lines are missing
in each branch only alternate values of these differences can be derived from the analysis.

ANALYSIS OF THE BANDS

The appearance of the bands under high dispersion can be seen from Plates 7, 8,
which show an enlargement of part of the (0, 0) band. Examination of the spectrum
on large-scale enlargements showed that of the two branches found by Frerichs, each
