attention has been devoted to the elucidation of its structure. It has not been
my intention to investigate this area from a purely geological point of view,
nor indeed has the time necessary for such a gigantic task, if undertaken single-
handed, been at my disposal. My object has, however, been to ascertain what light
the study of the fossil floras of the productive measures of the Wyre Forest throws
on its geology, and especially on the question of its relationship to the Midland and
Pennine coalfields. As we shall see, this line of inquiry has not previously been
pursued in this area. Further I have confined my attention, for the present, to the
productive or so-called grey measures, and I have not concerned myself with the red
rocks of the so-called ‘‘ Lower Permian,’ which there is some reason to believe are of
Upper Coal Measure or Keele age.

The fact that the Wyre Forest is but little worked for coal, and that a considerable
portion of it is densely forested, has naturally implied that the chances of obtaining
exposures of the Coal Measures, adequate for the purposes of fossil plant collecting,
are strictly limited. As the result of several weeks’ work during the last three
years, I have managed to obtain a fairly representative collection of fossil plants
from different parts of the Forest, and these will be found described here. In part
of this work I have had the help of the expert collecting of Mr. I. Rogers, to
whom, as on other occasions, I am indebted for unearthing many excellent examples
of the flora.

I would here also express my thanks to those who have aided me by permission to
collect on their property, and in this respect I am particularly indebted to the
owners or managers of all the collieries which are now at work in the Forest.
