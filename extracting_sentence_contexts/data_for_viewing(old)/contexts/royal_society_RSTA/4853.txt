on the topological properties of the Feynman graphs making up the complete amplitude. Some : s

of these graphs will be planar, i.e. can be drawn without any edges crossing. All tree-level graphs
(i.e. without any loops) will have this property. Such planar graphs have a well-defined ordering
of the external fields, at least up to dihedral symmetry. We may call this a ring-order. It turns out
that the dependence of the amplitude on the colours for such graphs is just given by the trace of
the product of the A matrices, in the appropriate ring-order.

The non-planar graphs are just as physical as the planar graphs, and must be included to obtain
a physical amplitude. But there are good reasons for concentrating on the planar graph sector as
giving a leading contribution. It then becomes natural to concentrate on a particular ring-ordering
of the external fields, and the colour-stripped amplitude associated with just that sub-sector of the
total amplitude. (In fact, it is quite common for the colour dependence to be left implicit when
discussing amplitudes, which leads to the danger of forgetting that a process with n coloured
gauge fields actually requires a sum over (n â€” 1)!/2 pieces, each corresponding to a different ring-
ordering, even when only the planar graphs are counted. This consideration will be brought back
to mind when we briefly consider gravitational scattering, below.)

In what follows we restrict our attention to a planar sector with a specified ring-ordering of the
external fields. Without loss of generality, the ordering is (123 ...), with momenta (p1, p2... Pn).
Now, it is easy to see from the nature of planar graphs that the momenta on the edges of any
Feynman graph in this sector have a special property. They can involve the external momenta only
ina particular manner: only through sums of consecutive momenta, like p2 + p3 or pa + ps + po, but
not p3 + pe-
