In these beautiful little organs the numerous fibres resulting from the 8ub-
division of the dark-bordered fibres are distributed over a comparatively 8mall extent
of tissue, forming the summit of the papilla. Still we have the same formation of
plexuses, the constant change in the direction taken by fibres, and the same crossing
and intercrossing which have been noticed in other situations. In fact the neryous
distribution in these organs presents the same typical arrangement as is met with in
other tissues, but it is compressed into a very small space. Now with regard to the epithelium-like structure upon the summit, it has been
shown that the nerve-fibres are probably continuous with the material lying between
the large nuclei. In fact if the interpretation of the appearances which I have given
be correct, the arrangement may be expressed thus â€”
