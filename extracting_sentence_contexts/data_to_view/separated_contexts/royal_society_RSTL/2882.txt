In a vessel containing a large quantity of the latter in-
sects, the Lytt, he found the thermometer rise several degrees above the tempe-
rature of the atmosphere. Dr. Davy, according to Berraorp}, in making observa-
tions on sevyeral species of insects, Scarabeus pilularis, Lampyris, Blatta, Gryllus,
and Apis, found only a slight difference, except in the Gryllus, in which the difference
amounted to five or 8ix degrees, while in the Scorpion and Centipede he found a
temperature Jower than that of the atmosphere. Dr. BurmersTss, in his Manual,
recently translated by Mr. SHuckasD, has spoken of the temperature of insects, but
only of insects in society, and has referred to the observations of Jucn, ReauMuR,
&e., and although he believes in the existence of individual temperature in insects,
has given no observation of his own to prove the fact, while Dr. BerTHoLD, in the
work just noticed, (experiment 59,) made on a single insect, could not detect it, nor
could he do 80 in every species when the observation was made on a number of indi-
viduals collected together. It is evident, therefore, that although the existence of
individual temperature is inferred from experiments on insects collected together,
It yet remains to be proved that every individual insect in a state of activity invariably
maintains a certain amount of temperature, which is readily appreciable by the in-
struments we are enabled to employ. Before detailing the results of my observations it is necessary to explain the manner
in which the observations themselves have been made, and to point out those cireum-
stances which seem to have been overlooked by other inquirers in their experiments
on the temperature of insects.
