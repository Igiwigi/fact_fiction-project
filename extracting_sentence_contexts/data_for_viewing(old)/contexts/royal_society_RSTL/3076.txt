netic needles near it, and these again a still greater number beyond them. Hence
would result the production of curved lines of inductive force-if the inducteous body
in such a mixed dielectric were an uninsulated metallic ball (1219. &c.) or other pro-
perly shaped mass. Such curyed lines are the consequences of the two electric forces
arranged as I have assumed them to be: and, that the inductive force can be directed
in 8uch curyed lines is the strongest proof of the presence of the two powers and the
polar condition of the dielectric particles.

1680. I think it is evident that in the case stated, action at a distance can only re-
sult through an action of the contiguous conducting particles. 'There is no reason
why the inductric body should polarize or affect distant conductors and leave those
near it, namely the particles of the dielectric, unaffected: and everything in the form
of fact and experiment with conducting masses or particles of a sensible size con-
tradicts such a supposition.

1681. Astriking character of the electric power is that it is limited and exclusive, and
that the two forces being always present are exactly equal in amount. The forces are
related in one of two ways, either as in the natural normal condition of an uncharged
insulated conductor; or as in the charged state, the latter being a case of induction.

1682. Cases of induction are easily arranged s0 that the two forces being limited
in their direction sball present no phenomena or indications external to the apparatus
employed. Thus if a Leyden jar, having its external coating a little higher than the
internal, be charged and then its charging ball and rod removed, such jar will present
no electrical appearances s0 long as its ontside is uninsulated. The two forces which
