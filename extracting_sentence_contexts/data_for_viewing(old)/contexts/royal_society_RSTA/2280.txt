the mathematically rigorous proof of existence has since been established, and the solutions are
referred to as the Cho-Maison monopole and dyon [14,15]. Moreover, we have dyons of opposite
electric charges and anti-dyons [16].

The recent discovery of the Higgs particle at LHC and Tevatron has reconfirmed that the
electroweak theory of Weinberg and Salam provides the true unification of electromagnetic and
weak interactions [18-20]. Indeed, it has widely been praised that the standard model has passed
the ‘final’ test with the discovery of the Higgs particle predicted by the model. But this enthusiasm
may be premature.

As the electroweak generalization of the Dirac monopole, this monopole should exist if the
standard model is correct. This means that the true final test of the standard model should come
from the discovery of the electroweak monopole, not the Higgs particle [13-15]. In fact, since the
electroweak monopole comes from the non-trivial topology of the standard model, the discovery
of this monopole must be viewed as the topological test of the standard model.

An important issue in the electroweak monopole is its mass, which is a crucial piece of
information for us to discover the monopole. We could not predict the mass of the Dirac
monopole, which has made the experimental detection of the monopole a blind search in a
dark room [21]. As a hybrid between Dirac and ’t Hooft-Polyakov, the Cho-Maison monopole
has a U(1) point singularity at the centre even though the SU(2) part is completely regular.
Consequently, it carries an infinite energy at the classical level, so that physically the mass of


the monopole remains arbitrary. A priori there is nothing wrong with this, but it would be nice if 3 |
