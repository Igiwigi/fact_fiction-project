non-zero if and only if is of the form @&); Ai(F;) with A; as above.

In general, if § is of the form (2.2), then there exists a character x of G/G° such that

(Fn, G @ x) 0.
Ifall n; are equal to 1, we denote F(,.,1) =F. Then
(F,G) =0

unless G =~ F, and
(F,G)=1

in that case.
The crucial point in the proof is the following very simple fact.
Lemma 2.8. With the notation of the theorem, assume that
(Fn, G) #0.
Then G is geometrically isomorphic to an object of T(F).
Proof. The co-invariant formula for lisse sheaves states that
(Fn, §) = dim(Fy,5 ® DGA))c-

The irreducibility of §, and the semi-simplicity of the representations involved, shows that if
this dimension is non-zero, then G is geometrically isomorphic to a sub-sheaf of F,. But clearly
this sheaf is itself an object of T(F), hence the result by transitivity. a


Proof of the theorem. By the lemma, G is geometrically isomorphic to an object of T(F). As it is Ee
