greater degree, the heights of the low waters. And thus some of the high waters are
depressed, and some of the low waters elevated, till there is little vertical distance
between the two. On the 17th of June the rise from low to high water in the afternoon
was only eight inches, although the rise in the forenoon had been four feet. In the
same manner, the fall from high to low water in the forenoon of June 22 was only
two inches, and in the forenoon of June 23 only one inch, although the intermediate
fall in the afternoon of those days was above four feet. And these movements of the
surface in the forenoons of those days, which we have called a fall from high to low
water, are in fact more simply conceived as a mere temporary check in the rise of
the water from the preceding low to the sncceeding high water. And accordingly
on June 24 the movement plainly assumes this character; the ascent is checked, but
no descent takes place. In the register of the observations it is stated that * from
6b to 8" the surface remained stationary, 80 that we may say there was no low
water.‚Äù And thus one of the two half-daily tides being obliterated, we have at this
period only one tide in the twenty-four hours.

This phenomenon, or an approximation to it, has already come under our notice
in the tides of Sincapore, of the Keeling Islands, and of Bassadore ; and has been
noticed by others in other places. It is to be recollected, however, that this redue-
tion of the two half-day tides to a single-day tide takes place only at a particular
period of each Iunation, depending upon the declination of the moon. When there-
