decidedly lower than those from the other two powders.

2, The mean proportions of sulphate furniched by P. and R. L. G. are not far
different, though the highest amount furnished by the former is considerably below,
and the. lowest number considerably above the corresponding numbers furnished by
R. L. G. powder. But the mean and the lowest proportions of $sulphate furnished by
F. G. is very considerably higher than the corresponding numbers obtained with the
two other powders (the highest amounts obtained with F. G. and R. L. G. being
identical).

The generally greater extent to which the sulphur has undergone complete oxidation
in the case of the F. G. powder is certainly not a result which can be in the least
ascribable to accidental cireumstances attending the experiments, and the fact that. ib
corresponds with the generally higher proportions of hyposulphite furnished by this
powder affords additional support to the view which we maintain, that the production
of the latter substance, in variable, and sometimes very considerable amounts from ;
the powders experimented with, is not to be explained away by ascribing ib to accident
of manipulation.

3. It will be seen that, whereas the means of the amounts of hyposulphite obtained
in the analyses of the residues from pebble and R. L. G. powders are almost identical,
they amount to little more than half that of the mean numbers furnished by the
