is the number of squares that can be formed of order 7, so that the sum of each row
and column is w, but in which there is no diagonal property in evidence.*

a particular case of a general formula given by the author (/oc. cit.).
Art. 137. To introduce the diagonal properties, proceed as follows :—
Let h,, denote what h,, becomes when de,, po,-,4. are written for @, a4:
respectively, and form the product h,,?h,,°...h.
I say that the coefficient of
