The latter two facilities are of particular
relevance to this special issue. Scaling-up the restoration of natural grazing dynamics is
constrained by the limited supply of herds of wild horses and
bovids. The EWB is a response to these constraints and the
fact that many rewilding initiatives lack the funds to buy
animals. The EWB enters into 5-year custodianship contracts
with recipient landowners or area managers. On maturity of
the 5-year contract, half of the herd must be ‘paid back’ to
grow the EWB’s ‘wildlife capital.’ Usually, the size of a
herd triples during this contract period.
