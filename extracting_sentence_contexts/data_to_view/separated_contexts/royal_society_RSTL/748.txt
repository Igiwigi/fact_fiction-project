The motive which immediately induced me to resume the
enquiry respecting the phosphoric combinations, was M. Du-
LoxG's paper. This ingenious chemist has not only endea-
voured to establish new proportions in the known compounds
of phosphorus, but has likewise attempted to prove the
existence of two new acids of phosphorus ; and has denied
several facts which I considered as sufficiently established,

The details which I have to lay before the Society in the


Sir H. Davy*'s new experiments on phosphorus. g17

following pages, will serve to correct and fix, I: hope, with
tolerable accuracy, the proportional number or equivalent-of
phosphorus, and-at-the same time will show the truth of the
general series of proportions that I assigned to its compounds:
In a case where my conclusions differ so materially from those
of M. Brrzerivs and Dvrons, it may be supposed: that 41
have not adopted them without considerable caution ; and EF
have preferred my own results to theirs, only because they
have been confirmed by minute and repeated experiments.
