it stands about equidistant from the two adjacent months.

ยง11. The graphical presentation of N and W diurnal inequalities, as given in
Tables XVI. and XVIL., is limited to the mean diurnal inequalities for the year from
the eleven years and the groups of years of sunspot maximum and minimum. These
are shown in the six uppermost curves of fig. 7.

If we take the mean diurnal inequality for the year, the range in H is only about
three-fifths that in D, while cos D is three times sin D. It follows from the last of
equations (2) that the influence of the D diurnal changes on W will largely exceed
that of the H changes. Hence the diurnal inequality in W must show a fairly close
approach in type to that in D. In the case of N the H diurnal changes exert more
influence than the D changes, but the preponderance is less. As a matter of fact,
however, there is a very close resemblance between the diurnal inequalities in H and
N. The inequality in D if reversed has a considerable resemblance to that in H, and
the contributions from H and D to the N diurnal inequality have opposite signs, so
numerically they assist one another.

It is pretty obvious, comparing figs. 1 to 7, that if we measured east-west changes
positive to the east, instead of to the west, and I changes positive from instead of
towards the vertical, the diurnal inequality curves for the year in all the six elements
considered here, and in D as welf, would agree in having as one of their most
prominent features a principal minimum occurring within an hour or two of noon.

According to Table XVL., the diurnal inequality in N is least in December, January
