This
is the only experiment we have made upon the angular gyrus. We have also
sometimes produced hemiopia in consequence of operations involving the under-
surface of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. These cases are probably to be explained by
the fact that the optic radiations into the occipital lobe have been reached by the

Movements of the eyes Munk appears inclined, but on very insufficient grounds, as it seems to us, to
connect with the angular gyrus. The ear-region he places around the extremity of the Synvian fissure. It must be borne in mind that the plan which Munk has drawn up has been obtained chiefly, if not
entirely, by ablation, whereas ours is mainly the result of excitation.
