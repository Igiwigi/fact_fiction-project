These formations
always take place in all the Myriapoda between the penultimate and antepenulti-
mate segments, and in that part of the cord the new ganglia are produced to those
segments. This leads us to 8ome important facts in reference to the means by which
the nervous cord itself is developed by extension and elongation of its fibres during
the growth of the whole body, and the development of the new segments ; and it
shows that an elongation takes place in the longitudinal fibres of the cord in the new
segments, and that ganglia are developed in its structure while commissural and
lateral fibres of reinforcement are in the course of: formation. But the distribution
of the nerves from these ganglia, and the structure of the ganglia themselves, seem
to lead us to the facts. In Polydesmus maculatus (fig. 9.), Nob., each of the six pos-
terior ganglia gives off two pairs of nerves. In no instance in these posterior seg-

from spaces between the ganglia.
