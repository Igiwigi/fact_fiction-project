the semitransparency of their shell; these spots are sometimes considerably enlarged,
and their eleyation increased, 80 that they become prominent papillz, closely resembling
the tubercles upon the septal bands. Their size and disposition yary considerably.
Sometimes they are small, numerous, and scattered without any definite arrangement
over the entire surface of the wall of the chamber, whilst in other cases they are con-
siderably larger, and form single, double, or eyen triple rows between the septal bands
(Plate V. fig. 10). Another remarkable variety of external aspect is produced by the
elevation of the general surface into rounded eminences closely abutting on one another
(like the pustules of the skin in a case of confluent small-pox), and distinguished from
the preceding by the absence of any peculiarity in the texture of the shell. That these
and other analogous variations of surface-marking have no value as differential characters,
is at once demonstrated, not merely by their gradational approximation in different indi-
viduals, but by the fact that they are presented in very different degrees on different
parts of the surface of the very same shell ; the chambers of one part of the spire being
strongly marked by certain of these peculiarities, whilst those of another may only
present indications of them, and those of a third may be perfectly smooth.

148. The collection of Mr. CuxinG, however, contains a group of forms which are at
once distinguished from the rest by their general physiognomy (Plate III. figs. 11, 12),
and which, when their characters are examined in detail, appear to be separated from
them by well-marked differences. Their aspect is much more lustrous, and their hue
much whiter, varied, however, by a tinge of green diffused in irregular patches; the
spire does not in the largest specimens make above three turns, and it begins to open out
sooner than in the type already described; the septa are usually considerably more
