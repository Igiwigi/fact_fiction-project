Therefore, it
is not surprising that noise enhanced image processing goes on to be widely investigated.

(b) Image perception

Image perception is another interesting field which has attracted a considerable attention since
the early days of SR [6,45,46]. In their pioneering work, Simonotto et al. have reported that adding
an appropriate amount of noise to a subthreshold image can enhance its perception through a
simple threshold detector [6]. In fact, they have established that the perceptive contrast threshold
of different subjects can be significantly reduced for an optimal noise level and that shorter
noise correlation times provided the best enhancement. In their psychophysics experiments, noise


was spatially added to the subthreshold image and was not static but rather with temporal
variations. By including such spatio-temporal random contributions, a basic model of a retina,
which takes into account the random sampling by photoreceptors and the involuntary eye tremor
[47], was next introduced and characterized by Zozor et al. [48].
