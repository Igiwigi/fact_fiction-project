molar being derived from a primary dipping down (like a deciduous tooth), the second
deriving its enamel-germ from the epithelial neck of the first, and the third from that
of the second (LnGros and Macon).

286 MR. C. $. TOMES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEETH

The error in GoopsIR's observations was nota very radical one, and was probably, at
that date, almost inevitable, inasmuch as the processes by which more modern invyesti-
gators have the advantage of sceing structures in sit4 were not, then discovyered : neyer-
theless, though the error in fact was not great, the deductions based upon it effect a
wider divergence from the truth ; and the terms * papillary stage,” *follicular stage,” &c.
should be abandoned, as inapplicable to the phenomena observed in any teeth whateyer
which have been satisfactorily examined. The development of the simple teeth which
have no enamel, and that of the teeth of Fish, Batrachia, and Reptilia, has been but
little investigated, though the very early appearance of the enamel-germ in other Mam-
malia lends an additional interest to the inquiry.

I was myself fortunate enough to obtain specimens of foetal armadillos, from which
I was able to establish that, although not a particle of enamel was formed, the sequence
of events was identical with that observed in other mammals *, yiz. a dipping down of
epithelium to form an enamel-organ, which differed in minor respects only from that
found where enamel is really formed (Quart. Journ. Microsc. Science, Jan. 1874).
