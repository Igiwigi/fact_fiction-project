field theories.

The demonstration that Nature hides both chiral and gauge symmetry is
exciting because hidden symmetry opens the possibility of simple theories
generating very complex phenomena, including perhaps the extravagance
of the Standard Model.

Supersymmetry is often sold on the basis that it potentially solves the
hierarchy problem/stabilizes the W and Z masses, but it seems to me that
more powerful (although admittedly purely aesthetic) arguments are the
beauty of the idea of unifying bosons and fermions (against which must
be set the extravagance of having to invoke the existence of so many new
particles), and the fact that it is the last of the four possible symmetries
of Lagrangian field theory (the others being Lorentz invariance, internal
symmetries and gauge symmetries), and (see the next point) provides a
natural framework for introducing gravity.
