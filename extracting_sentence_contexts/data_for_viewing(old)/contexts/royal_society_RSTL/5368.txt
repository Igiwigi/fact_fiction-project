$5 remaining eight being sterile. Some of these failures were probably due to the cir-

5 cumstance that the fecundatory fluid was not applied to the most susceptible part of

= the egg, yet the general results sufficiently show not only that fecundation is more

2 surely and quickly effected at a moderately high than at a low temperature, but also

Fthat it is 80, more or less certainly and quickly, in proportion to the amount of

S influence supplied.

S These facts lead us to some further consideration of the results of the application

= of definite quantities of the fecundatory agent to the egg, as affecting the develop-

= ment of the embryo, and possibly also as influencing both the evolution of its physical

E structure and p$ychical condition. TI have little hesitation in believing that whatever

E be the precise nature of the influence communicated by the fecundatory agent to the

i egg, that it is only after full and complete impregnation that perfectly normal and

YZ healthy embryos are formed, and ultimately attain to the maturity of the species.
