exposition of thermodynamics. Sadly, however, he died of cholera in 1832 at the age of 36. Luckily,
his memoir did not die with him for it was discovered by Emile Clapeyron who had it republished
in 1834 [6]. Even then, it was ignored by the scientific community until it was rediscovered by
William Thomson in the 1840s. Thomson realized the importance of the work and provided
an account of the theory for the English-speaking reader [7]. However, he was not prepared to
renounce the caloric theory and wrote, ‘To deny it would be to overturn the whole theory of heat,
in which it is the fundamental principle’.

5. Joule’s experiments in the 1840s =

James Joule had no doubt that the caloric theory was fundamentally flawed. He arrived at this : ”
conclusion with growing conviction through a long series of experimental investigations starting ae
in the late 1830s and extending through the 1840s. In fact, Joule’s suspicions concerning the :
relation between heat and work may stem from an even earlier period. In 1813, the engineer Peter ne]
Ewart published a paper in the Manchester Memoirs [8] urging his readers to accept the principle DNS
of the conservation of vis viva. The term vis viva literally means living force and was defined as a
mass multiplied by velocity squared, i.e. twice the kinetic energy. Ewart wrote, ‘If we could get [k
rid of all the imperfections in our steam engines we should find that a certain amount of heat .
always yielded a fixed equivalent of work’. The notable point is that John Dalton helped to write
this paper and so it may have been through Dalton that Joule first learnt of this attempt to bring
the conservation of energy into the picture.

The 1830s was a decade of great advances in the science and application of electricity. In
1831, Michael Faraday (1791-1867) discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction
and this was rapidly followed by the invention of the electric motor and generator, clear
