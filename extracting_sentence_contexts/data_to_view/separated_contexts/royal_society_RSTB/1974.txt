Neutral, that is to say neither green nor violet. The nentral region between red and blue during
green-blindness has quite a different hue. It should be noted that the word is not used to indicate the
colonr known to artista as “neutral tint,” but is rather intended to emphasise the fact that during blue-
blindness the green of the spectrum passes into violet through a colour in which there is uot the
slightest suggestion of blue. MR. G. J. BURCH ON ARTIFICIAL TEMPORARY COLOUR-BLINDNESS. 15
