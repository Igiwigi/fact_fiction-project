with the bicycle .saddle at the correct height. This time he was pretty comfortable
throughout the work, though he sweated a good deal notwithstanding the two fans,
The picture presented in this experiment is somewhat different from that in the
preceding one. The average respiratory exchange during the work is a good deal
lower, as indeed one might expect since he was not subject to the disadvantage
of a cramped position. Though the oxygen consumption in the three later observa-
tions during the work is higher than in the first, the rise is neither so marked as in
Experiment 10 nor is it progressive. The CO, output remains constant for the
greater part of the work period, but diminishes somewhat in the last determination.
The respiratory quotient is only 0Â°966 in the first observation during the work, and
shows a diminution during the course of the work, though in the last observation
during the work it is still a good deal above the initial resting value. The whole
course of events during the muscular work is, in fact, remarkably like that found in
the case of Dova.as in the long experiments with lighter work (Experiments 5 and 6,
Table 111). Nine minutes after the work ceased, however, the respiratory quotient
falls below the initial resting value, and a further fall occurs in subsequent periods,
and even when the experiment terminated 48 minutes later there was no sign of
recovery.

In Experiments 9 and 10 it willbe seen that the hyperpnoea during the work is at
a maximum in the first determination, 7.e., at a time corresponding to the abnormally
high respiratory quotient, and CO, output, and that there is a decided drop in the
amount of air breathed per minute in the subsequent observations during the exercise.
This definite variation in the hyperpncea is, however, absent in Experiment 11 in
which the respiratory quotient during the work is always well below unity. If we
