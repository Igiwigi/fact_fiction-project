right in the depression above this point, but in a higher position closer to its normal
position.

The explanation is probably as follows :â€”After isolation of P,, the second primordium
was situated lower down in relation to the wound than after isolation of I,, as has been
pointed out already, and the lateral extension of its stipule was therefore limited by the
side of the wound. Consequently, it was not possible for the central part of the second
younger primordium to arise in the deepest part of the depression between wound and
contact leaf : for if it had done so there would not have been room for its stipule. And
the centres of primordia are not found to arise in positions that do not leave sufficient
room for the stipules.

This explanation is supported by the fact, already mentioned, that after isolation
of P,, the second younger primordium was nearly always symmetric, like the primordia
of an intact plant, its morphological centre being midway between the edges of its
stipules. For this indicates that the position of the morphological centre depended on
the positions of the edges. On the other hand, after isolation of I,, the second primordium
(I) was situated higher up in relation to the wound, so that its stipule was able to extend
for a long way through the region above the wound, and usually became abnormally
large, making the whole primordium asymmetric (see Table I). Consequently, the
displacement of the centre of I, towards the wound was usually not limited by the
necessity for allowing room for its stipule, and the central part of that primordium was
therefore free to arise in contact with the wound, in the deepest part of the depression
between wound and contact leaf.
