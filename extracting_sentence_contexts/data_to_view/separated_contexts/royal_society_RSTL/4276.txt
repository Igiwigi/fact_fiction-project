<« Soon after the eight pairs of ribs have begun to expand a process is sent off from
above near the spinal column, which by its growth overlaps the few and slender
dorsal muscles, and unites with the spinous process of the vertebrae.” Such a de-
scription of the development of the costal plates could be suggested, I believe, only
by observation of a tolerably young specimen of Chelone or Emys. There is no
mention of the development of the costal plates in the Tortoise (Testudo) by super-
position of osseous matter upon the rib, the supporting part of which rib retains its
normal form without expanding : there is no allusion to the alternately varying posi-
tion of the superimposed dermal ossification in regard to the rib supporting it, nor to
the relation of the incipient costal plates to the angles of union of the epidermal
scutes. Perhaps these facts, so important in guiding us to the right homology of the,
costal plates of the carapace, were manifested in the young Tortoises examined by
Prof. RaTake, though he has not described them : and yet it would be unfair, without

stronger evidence, to suppose such defects in his description. They are, however,
plainly demonstrated in my preparations, and are accurately represented in the
figures 4 and 5 of Plate XIII, I entirely concur with Prof, RaTaks in regarding
the marginal plates as dermal bones: in every particular of deyelopmental character
they agree with one-fourth of the median series of bony plates of the carapace (neural
plates); and in every respect, save connation with endo-skeletal bones, they agree
with the rest of the median series and with all the costal series of bony plates of the
carapace.
