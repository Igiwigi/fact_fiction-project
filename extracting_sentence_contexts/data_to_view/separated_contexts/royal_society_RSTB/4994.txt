I would rather suggest that the function
of this small artery is to ensure the blood supply of the posterior wall of the
tympanic cavity, the thymus gland, and the musculus depressor mandibule, I have
called it, therefore, the arteria hyomandibularis. The arteria stapedialis (arteria
facialis) frequently shows a constriction as it passes the stapes (Stage P,
Embryo 45a), and it is occasionally somewhat sunken in a groove on the anterior
surface of this cartilage (Stage P, Embryo 45a, Q. 51a, and R. 141). These facts

may possibly be adduced as additional evidence in favour of the generally accepted
homology between the arteria stapedialis (arteria facialis) of the Reptilia and the
arteria stapedialis of the Mammalia. The presence of an artery piercing the stapes in many Mammalian embryos was
demonstrated by SALEensKy (1880), and although the vessel usually atrophies in
Man, it persists in many other Mammals.
