The
mere plotting out on Bior’s original plan of a series of accurate experimental data
would therefore have disclosed to him both the existence and the magnitude of Drupr’s
correction. 4

Tn the absence of Bror’s mathematical genius, however, nearly all the work on rotatory
dispersion during the next half-century became semi-qualitative in character, the data
being represented by curves of unknown form, instead of by mathematical equations. This fact affords an explanation of the exaggerated importance which was attached to
the more conspicuous anomalies, as well as of the utter confusion into which all attempts
to classify rotatory dispersion fell. Thus, in the absence of any precise knowledge of
the real form of the dispersion curves, KrECKE seized upon “ the anomaly that, in con-
centrated solutions of tartaric acid, the green rays are turned more than the red and
violet rays ” (‘ Arch. Néerlandaises,’ 1872, vol. 7, p. 114).
