The problems with which this work is concerned can best be introduced by a brief
description of the general form of the alimentary canal and of the course of the food
through it, so far as this can be observed in an entire living specimen resting in a weak
suspension of carmine in sea water.

The pharynx (fig. 1, ph.) is continued backwards into a short and narrow oesophagus
(oes.) which passes into a wide mid-gut (ma.); at the point of junction there arises the
mid-gut diverticulum (div.) which extends forwards along the right side of the
pharynx. The mid-gut passes into the short region termed by van WyyHE (1916)
the ilio-colon ring (icr.), and from this the hind-gut (Ag.) passes straight to the anus.
According to vAN WiHE it is uncertain whether the ring should be regarded as
belonging to the hind-gut or to the mid-gut. In the light of the facts to be described
below, the non-committal terms “ mid-gut’’, “‘hind-gut”’ and “ mid-gut diverticulum”’
seem preferable to such terms as “‘stomach”, “intestine”, “liver” and “hepatic
diverticulum” which have been used by various writers, and the former will therefore
be employed here throughout, as they have been by FRANz (19272).

Fic. 1—Alimentary canal of Amphioxus, to show the chief regions.

Mixer (1844) has described the mid-gut and diverticulum as greenish in colour,
but this depends a good deal upon the illumination. More commonly they present
an opaque yellow-brown colour, although a green tinge is certainly sometimes visible.
