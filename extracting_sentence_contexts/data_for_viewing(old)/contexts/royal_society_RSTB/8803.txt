The idea that the dual roles of RNA as code and catalyst
might have bootstrapped life gained support over the years
as additional catalytic RNAs were discovered, and especially
after large-scale structural RNAs (e.g. ribosomes) were finally
crystallized showing that it was the RNA itself, not the
associated proteins, that directly catalysed the attachment of
each coded-for amino acid ‘meaning unit’ onto the growing
protein chain [29-31].

An assumption that lies behind many language origin scen-
arios is something that I have called the ‘semantic urge’.
This intuition grows out of the fact, just mentioned above,
that the human linguistic coding system was built on top of
a lower-level biological coding system that was already
capable of constructing sophisticated, non-linguistic cognitive
systems such as those in parrots, whales, dogs and primates.
The sustained goal-directedness of animals makes it very
hard to avoid the notion that human language must have
somehow grown out of an insistent craving of inarticulate
homininds to communicate complex meanings to each
other, perhaps initially by gesture, given that vocal motor wo . .

related to us probably was not up to the task. RNA world
