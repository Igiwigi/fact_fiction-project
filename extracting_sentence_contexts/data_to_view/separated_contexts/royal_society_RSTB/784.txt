facial portion. Finally, it is evident that the change just referred to continues with
increasing age, from the fact that the first dentition is more generalized than the
second one, and requires, as a consequence, shorter jaws ; and as it is now proved that
the first dentition is ontogenetically and phylogenetically the older,* it follows that
the shortness of the facial region is the primitive condition. There may, of course, be
instances in which the reduction of the facial part of the skull is partly a secondary
specialization (e.g., certain Primates), but this circumstance does not invalidate the
general result. Let us proceed to consider the remaining parts of the skull of the Megaladapis,
with a view of ascertaining whether they be primitive or specialized.
