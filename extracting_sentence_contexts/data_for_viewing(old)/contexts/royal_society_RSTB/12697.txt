(see [30] for a causal account). But it generally does so by
recasting the arrow from Z; to Z in terms of genes, which
is what is needed for a causal description. Figure 1c shows
that this again puts genes as the root cause. It is a sort of
fusion of figure 1a,b, but the roles of genes and phenotypes
are different. The link between G; and Gio is required to get
a causal explanation of inheritance. Intervening on or
changing Z; still would not change G?.

Intervening on Z; does, however, change fitness and this is a
source of confusion. By changing fitness, this intervention does
affect selection in the narrow sense of effecting change within
that generation. In fact, the definition of the selection coefficient
is a Price-equation covariance, cov(Z;,W;) [45]. But, not all of
this change extends across generations, as Fisher formalized
through his concepts of average excess, average effect and
breeding value. This is Fisher's third sword, which | will use
in the rest of this paper. To understand lasting selection and
adaptation, we do not need to worry about all effects on phe-
notypes or fitness; we only need to worry about the ones that
cause selective change across generations.
