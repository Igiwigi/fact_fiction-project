to the curator of the Peterborough Museum, Mr J. W. Brodger (Fox 1923).

(d) A bronze socketed adze now in the Wisbech Museum (Garrood 1929).

(e) A monoxylous canoe of oak (Heathcote 1876).

Yaxley Fen. A flat bronze axe in the British Museum (Fox 1923).

Pondersbridge (Pondâ€™s Bridge). A middle Bronze Age spade-hilted rapier was found
here with the point sticking in the underlying clay, and is now in the Peterborough
Museum.

The fact that so much of this material is referable to the Bronze Age is strikingly in
agreement with the circumstance long recognized by fen archaeologists, and parti-
cularly emphasized by Fox (1923), that throughout the south-western fenland remains
of the Bronze Age are extremely abundant, in greatest contrast with those of the
preceding and following periods.

It is a feature strongly suggestive of increased habitability, i.e. dryness, of the fenland
during the Bronze Age. The stratigraphical position of deposits of this period is
discussed in the second part of this paper, but it is indicated by the Pondersbridge find
that they were formed after the deposition of the fen clay. Their formation was
evidently followed by a period of increased wetness and already indicated by the
conditions of the palstave discovery in the Raveley Drain.
