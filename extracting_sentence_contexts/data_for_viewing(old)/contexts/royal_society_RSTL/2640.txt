My very earlieſt obſervations ſhewed me that the
ſca-anemonies feel and -prognoſticate within doors the
different changes of temperature in the atmoſphere. 1
had not leiſure at that time to form tables of their various
indications; but I have ſince done-it, This fact, if ap=
plied to praftice, might be of uſe in the formation of a |
ſea-barometer, an object of no ſmall importance, which
ſeveral ingenious men have hitherto endeavoured in vain |
to furniſh us with, 1 ſhould prefer the anemonies of the :
third ſpecies for this purpoſe, their ſenſation being very
quick; they are alſo cafily procured, and may be kept *
without nouriſhment. Five of them may be put in a.
glaſs vefſe}, four inches wide and as many in ——
which they will ſoon cleave to the angle formed by the
fides and the bottom. "The water muſt be renewed every |
day, and, as they do not require a great quantity of it,, ;
as much may be fetched from the ſea (if they be kept on. \
