It is, however, an alloy which has always been
found rather difficult to manage ; it is not easily cast sound, even of moderate dimen-
sions, by the ordinary processes of the founder, or by those which have been published
by scientific men ; and even when $0 cast is very liable to break in cooling, or after-
wards by exposure to any slight but sudden change of temperature, sometimes break-
ing even without any apparent cause,

The difficulties appeared s0 great, that reflecting upon SMearToN's account of Sir
W. Herscner's labours, I had very little hope that any very large specula could be
cast and safely polished of s0 brittle and untractable a material ; and although some
of the difficulties have been surmounted, till it is probable, that in seeking to obtain
the utmost possible amount of telescopic power the state of our atmosphere admits
of, the requisite dimensions will not be attained by a simple casting of this alloy. The idea, therefore, obyiously suggested itself of uniting several castings into one re-

of zinc and copper, (in fact, upon a species of brass,) which should expand and
contract in the same proportion as speculum metal. The experiment was tried repeatedly upon a small scale, and the difficulties which
presented themselves successively surmounted, till at length a speculum of three feet
aperture was completed, which bears distinctly a high power. The evil most to be apprehended in this construction, was unequal contraction and
expansion in the different changes of atmospheric temperature ; that, however, seems
to have been sufficiently guarded against, as I have never succeeded in detecting the
slightest change of figure.
