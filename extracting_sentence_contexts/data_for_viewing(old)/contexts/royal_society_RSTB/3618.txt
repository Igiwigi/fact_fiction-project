this country, Europe, and America, and that among the numerous opinions kindly
offered, I have been told it resembled closely nearly every family ranging from the
Gnetales on one hand to the Malvales on the other. This is not to be interpreted
to mean that the woods of all these families are alike, and that consequently classifi-
cation of them is impossible, but it is due to the comparatively few samples that
any one individual studies and to the great range of variations between the woods of
so-called species of so-called genera. By far the best account of wood structures with
which I am acquainted, viz. Mout and JaNnssonrus (1906), gives, for example, a very
different account of the Magnoliaceze from the one that would have been written
had the woods from temperate regions and not those from Java been the main object
of their study.

Further difficulties arise from the fact that as the new fossil wood is of such an
early age, it is most unlikely that it belongs to any living genus. At the same time


THE EARLIEST EUROPEAN ANGIOSPERMS. 91

we know almost nothing of the plants of intermediate age, the details of whose
structure, were they fully known, would indicate the lines of descent connecting the
earlier Angiosperms with those now extant.

Several points, however, may be noticed. There is not a single feature of
“Cyeadean”-like character in the wood, and if Angiosperms arose from that group,
they must have done so even further back than has been supposed. Nor are there, so
