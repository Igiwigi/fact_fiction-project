end westward, we must remember that the preceding cold, being perhaps even hours only to the west, is by its
action on the general system of the curves aiding the westening of the needle, whilst the $un is in the east
and even over the meridian (3005.).


ATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMâ€”CAPE OP GOOD HOPE. 105

3032. I am inclined to refer much of this precession of the warm region at Toronto
to the geographical distribution of land and water there. The Atlantic is on the
east and the continent of America on the west of the station, and as Dove's charts
and results intimate, the temperature may rise higher and sooner over the land than
over the water, and 80 throw the warm region in respect of Toronto in advance of the
time or of the 8un. In the case of Hobarton the arrangement is different ; and, in fact,
what land there is is between the advancing sun and the station, and would tend to
hold the warm air region back, and tend to cause its time to coincide with that of
the sun. Even the greater difference in summer than in winter at Toronto appears
to be explicable in the same manner, by reference to the relative position of the sun
at the two seasons to the land and water arrangement.

3033. Though the temperature on the earth's surface is a very uncertain indication
of that above (2937.), yet as far as it goes it harmonizes with this view. The maxi-
mum temperature occurs s0oner after midday at Hobarton than at Toronto; in the
former place it is at 2 o'clock and very regular, and the minimum at 16-19 o'clock,
being earlier in summer and later in winter. At 'Poronto the maxima are from 2 to 4
o'clock, and the minima at 16-18 o'clock. The maxima are later in summer than
