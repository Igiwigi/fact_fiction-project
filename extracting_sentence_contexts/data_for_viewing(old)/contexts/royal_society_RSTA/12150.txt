_ | the energy, which he reduces to its principal axes in the ordinary manner; and then
he deduces from it in natural and easy sequence, without a hitch, or any forcing of
© constants, all the known laws of propagation and reflexion for transparent isotropic
and crystalline media, In common with Neumany, he cannot understand how with
| Fresvet the inertia in a erystal could be different in different directions, or its
“pl| elasticity isotropic ; so he assumes the density of the wether to be the same in all
& media, but its elasticity to be variable. The laws of crystalline reflexion are then
a established as below, and shown to be embraced in a single theorem relating either
Hi to his transversals or to his polar plane ; and the memoir ends with a remark ‘“ which
may be necessary to prevent any misconception as to the nature of the foundation on
g which” the theory stands. “ Everything depends on the form of the function V;
= and we have seen that, when that form is properly assigned, the laws by which
& Systals act upon light are included in the general equations of dynamics. This fact
16 is fully proved by the foregoing investigations. But the reasoning which has been
2 used to account for the form of the function is indirect, and cannot be regarded as
z sufficient, in a mechanical point of view. It is, however, the only kind of reasoning
that we are able to employ, as the constitution of the luminiferous medium is
entirely unknown.”
