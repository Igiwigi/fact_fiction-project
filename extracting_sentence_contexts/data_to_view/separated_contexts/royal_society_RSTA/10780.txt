When the cottage was removed the mallow had spread over the whole
patch, I believe very little by seed, but largely by stolons. This seemed to provide
excellent material ready to hand, and from it we can draw some conclusions as to the
influence of such a division on the degree of resemblance of like parts. It will be
remembered that Darwry,} in experimenting on Origanum vulgare, found that
& cross-fertilisation of flowers on plants which had separate roots, but had spread by
5 stolons from the same individual, presented no advantage over self-fertilisation, and
-2 he concluded that this arose from the fact that the plants were really one and the
2 same individual so far as such processes were concerned. If this were so in the case
A of my mallow, we ought to find a great reduction in the relationship of undiffer-
= éntiated like organs. Two points struck me at the outset—the small variability in
ic the segmentation of the seed vessels and the low mean value (13°7) compared with
