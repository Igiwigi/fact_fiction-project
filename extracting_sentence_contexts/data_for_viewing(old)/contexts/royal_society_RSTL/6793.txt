decomposition for a period of about six months, during which time they lost three-fourths
of their carbon. In the experiments on the question of the assimilation of free Nitrogen,
however, but a very small proportion of the total organic matter is subjected to decom-
posing actions apart from those associated with growth, and this for a comparatively
short period of time, at the termination of which the organic form is retained, and
therefore but little carbon is lost. It would appear, then, that- we need not fear any
serious error in our experiments in regard to the latter question, arising from the
evolution of free Nitrogen in the decomposition of the nitrogenous organic matters

olved. On the other hand, the facts adduced afford a probable explanation of any
ll loss of Nitrogen which may occur when seeds have not grown, or when leaves, or
r dead matter, have suffered partial decomposition.

e mutual relations of Gaseous Nitrogen and the Nascent Hydrogen evolved during

"The importance attached by MuLpeR, and others after him; to the action of nascent
Irogen, evolved in the decompoxsition of organic matter, upon gaseous Nitrogen, as a
e of ammonia, is snch as to require that we should refer to the subject here, in
he course of the discussion of the conditions possibly affecting the snpply of combined
Nitrogen to our experimental plants. The results given in the last sub-section (pp- 509â€”
