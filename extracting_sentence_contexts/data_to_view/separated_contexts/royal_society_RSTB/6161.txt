A small protein crystalloid is sometimes present in the nucleolus,
as in fig. 12. Neither now nor at earlier stages can free ends of threads be seen in
uncut nuclei. For reasons which will appear later, the beaded character of the
leptotene thread at this time is believed to be due to the fact that it is composed
of two threads twisted about each other and so forming nodes and internodes. The threads are presumably double also in the earlier stages represented by figs. 10
and 11, but they may be too near the limits of resolution to show any indications of
this. There is no indication as to what happens to the numerous granules which
disappear between figs. 11 and 12.
