arched carapace that the tie-bearers do to the king-post in the architecture of a roof.
From the fact of the metapophyses in the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae of the Mega-
therium, Plate XVII. and Plate XIX. figs. 4 and 5, m, not being developed beyond the
state of a tubercle, I long ago drew the inference that, like the Sloths and Anteaters,
it was not covered by a bony armour.

382 PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE MEGATHERIUM.

With regard to the cervical vertebr, the fact of the Megatherium having the
normal number in the Mammalian class, seyen—if it were not sufficiently established
by the well-adjusted articulations of those in the skeleton here described, rendering
any supplemental vertebra inadmissible,—would have been made most probable by
the same number being present in the skeleton of the Megatherium at Madrid, and
in the more complete skeleton of the Mylodon in the Museum of the Royal College
of Surgeons in London. Moreover, that one of the Megatherioids had seven cervical
vertebra and no more is certain: the skeleton of the Scelidotherium, discovered and
deposited by Mr. Darwin in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, having
been imbedded, without disturbance of the true vertebrz, and those of the neck being
exposed in the ordinary number, and in their natural juxtaposition, on the removal
of the stony matrix*.
