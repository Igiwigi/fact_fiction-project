The first point that strikes one in the copper-tin curve is the rapid way in which
the steepness increases with increasing percentage of tin. If we bear in mind the
fact that, on account of the thermometer lag, so important where the curve is steep,
the true equilibrium curve from 5 to 15 atoms of tin may lie perceptibly above our
freezing-point curve, while, from the character of the freezing point at 15:5 atoms,
the two curves must agree at this point, we can conclude that at 15 the true curve
may be almost a vertical line. A not improbable explanation of this feature of the
curve is to suppose that the tin is largely combining with the copper to form mole-
cules, such as SnCu, or SnCu, As can be proved by the use of this assumption in
equation (2), the view that the body in solution is SnCu, agrees very well with the
shape of the curve up to 15 atoms of tin. But we do not attach much importance to
this numerical agreement, as the assumption of the existence of molecules of SnCu,,
accompanied by some dissociation, would give an equally good agreement.

At 15Â°5 atoms of tin our curve changes its direction, and becomes a straight line ;
