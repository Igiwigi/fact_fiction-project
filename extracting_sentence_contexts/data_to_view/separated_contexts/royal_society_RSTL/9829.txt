This preliminary labour
necessarily required much time, and though the accessible trees were exhausted in
1879, the final revision of the specimens and the microscopic examination of the bones
and teeth have been completed only in the present year. I may add that, unless additional specimens are exposed by falls of the cliff, further
material of this kind can be obtained only by mining in the 6-inch coal supporting
the trees, and. its roof. In the following pages I propose to notice as shortly as is consistent with clearness,
the new facts obtained from the study of these interesting fossils, under the following
heads :â€”

1. Geological relations of the beds containing the fossiliferous trees,
2. Character and contents of the trees.
3.
