Tn the synsacral region no median subchordal connection between the right and left
sclerotomes, belonging to a metamere, is established. In addition to this the incipient

synsacral intercentrum does not display any differentiation into an interventral and
basiventral division. The synsacral intercentrum is laid down in the mesenchyme of
the ventral-most (subchordal) portion of the fused cranial and caudal sclerotomites of
a sclerotome and occupies at its first origin a strictly intrasclerotomic (= intervertebral)
position. These facts explain the paired character of the synsacral intercentra and the
absence of a transverse groove on the ventral surface of them in comparing them with the
intercentra of the cervical and the anterior portion of the thoracic region.

The perichordal tube which in 4-day Larus and in 7-day Struthio exhibits a more or
less uniform structure throughout, has become differentiated into two kinds of struc-
turally different segments alternating regularly with each other. One system of these
segments consists of sparse spindle-shaped cells with abundant palish blue intercellular
substance. ‘These segments of the perichordal tube surround the dilated portions of the
notochord and may be called vertebral rings (fig. 15, v.7.). Comparative analysis of the
following stages of development shows that these. rings represent the nuclei of the verte-
