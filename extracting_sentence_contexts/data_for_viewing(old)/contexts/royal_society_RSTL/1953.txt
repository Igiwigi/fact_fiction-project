V. Recapitulation.

To avoid misapprehension, I think it right, in conclusion, very briefly to re-
capitulate the claims of this paper :

1. Many of the facts which depend upon the reflex function have long been
known to physiologists :

2. But these facts only extend to the excited action of the reflex function,
seen in the limbs, and even they have been erroneously ascribed to sensation
and volition, or instinct :

3. The facts of excited movements of the larynx, pharynx, sphincters, and
ejaculators, and of the panniculus carnosus, have not been shown to be allied
to these, and to be dependent on the same individual function of the neryous
System :

4. It has not been shown that this function, in its natural state, constitutes
the principle of equilibrium and tone, in the whole muscular system, and the
principle which presides over the orifices and sphincters of the internal canals:

5, And certainly not, that this principle, morbidly affected, constitutes, in
its different forms, the diseases arising from dentition, and the diseases termed
tetanus, hydrophobia, chorea, paralysis agitans, certain forms of epilepsy,
of tremor, of asthma, &c. &c. :
