This, however, does not prevent us from employing the cephalic
invaginations in a determination of head segmentation. The following is my interpretation of the cephalic invaginations. In view of the fact
that all investigators are in agreement as to the origin of the main invaginations from
behind the antennz, mandibles, first and second maxille, | maintain that we have here
another criterion for testing our conception of the segmental constitution of the head. It is of the greatest significance to notice that a second invagination arises immediately
behind that of the anterior tentorial invagination. This can reasonably be associated
with the very reduced premandibular segment, though by the time this pair of invagina-
tions is easily recognisable the segment itself has been absorbed.
