lines are drawn to indicate the variations theoretically expected: in order to show
that the phase 9, changes at double the rate of 0, and 03, the vertical scale of angle
for 0, is in the figure taken as half that for 0,, 9, 9, (this reduction of the scale of
angle for 0, is also appropriate in view of the very small amplitude C, of Ly, which,
of course, makes the significance, in force units, of a given accidental variation in 9,
much less than that of the same variation in 0,, 94, or 93). It is clear from the figure
that the phase-angles 0,, 0; and 0, do change at the theoretical rates and in the expected
directions.

In the theory of these changes of phase which was given in the paper already referred
to in this section, it was concluded that all the phases should agree at new moon. The
last line of Table [V indicates that this is not the case. The result is not surprising,
however, in view of the fact that L must be a distinctly more complex phenomenon
(cf. Part IV of this paper) than was assumed in the theory referred to.

The Seasonal Changes of the Lunar Diurnal Variation.

$18.1. In Table IV the amplitudes and phases of the first four components of the
lunar diurnal variation of declination at Greenwich are given for each calendar month,
for the three seasons, and for the mean of the year, as derived from the whole material
used. â€˜The number of lunar days from which each set of values are derived is indicated,
and these numbers are so great as to give considerable confidence in the results, at least
in cases where the amplitude C is 10 units (0-1 y) or more. Where the amplitude is
less than this, very little reliance can be placed on the corresponding phase.
