the action of the two modes of ignition, and appears to indicate that it is not simply the
heat developed by the chemical change of the gunpowder or detonating powder which
determines the explosion of the nitroglycerine.

An experimental investigation of this subject has left no doubt on my mind that the
explosion of nitroglycerine through the agency of a small detonation is due, at any rate
in part, to the mechanical effect of that detonation, and that this effect may operate in
exploding the nitroglycerine quite independently of any direct action of the heat disen-
gaged by the gunpowder or other detonating charge.

I was led to examine into this question by an interesting and important observation
recently made by my Asistant, Mr. E. O. Browx, in connexion with gun-cotton. The
fact that the violent explosion of this snbstance cannot be developed except when it is
confined in receptacles of some strength has been up to the present time accepted as
indisputable. It occurred, however, to Mr. Brow that as gun-cotton is analogous in its
nature and operation as an explosive agent to nitroglycerine, differing principally from
that substance in the rapidity and consequent violence of its explosion, it might also,
like nitroglycerine, be susceptible of violent explosion when unconfined, by being ignited
through the agency of detonation. This proved to be the case; for upon exploding
a small charge of detonating powder in contact with, or in the immediate vicinity to,
compressed gun-cotton freely exposed to air, instead of the latter being simply inflamed
and then burning gradually, as would be the case if it were brought into contact with
flame or any sufficient source of heat, it explodes with great violence, exerting a destruc-
tive action equal to that of nitroglycerine, and decidedly greater than that produced by
5 gun-cotton when exploded under the conditions hitherto believed to be those most
