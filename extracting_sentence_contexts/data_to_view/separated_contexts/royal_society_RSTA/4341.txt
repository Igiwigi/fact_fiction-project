These are very different networking scenarios often referred
to as north-south (aggregation to core) versus east-west (metro-only) traffic flows. The metro
environment is much more cost and energy sensitive and the metro market is driven more by
large numbers rather than high performance. In fact, the traffic composition in a metro network
is very similar to a data-centre network, where the majority of traffic comprises east-west flows
[7]; however, the metro area is clearly more distributed and the network nodes or end users are
much more heterogeneous. Applications within a metro environment range from radio access,



sensor networks and consumer communications to storage area networks (e.g. for the finance
and entertainment industries), scientific computing and large campus networks. To deal with energy concerns in future optical networks, photonic integration has emerged
as an important technology.
