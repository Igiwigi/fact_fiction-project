8uch fundamental importance as justly to constitute the essential difference between his
two orders Cyclostegues and Helicostegues. For, as T have shown, although Orbitolites
is typically cyclical from its commencement, yet specimens frequently present themselves
in which its early development has taken place. s0 completely on the helical plan, that
if such had been collected before their assumption of the cyclical mode of growth, their
essentially Cyclostegue character would not have been suspected.

239. Again, T have shown that-a parallel variation is displayed by the genus Orbiculing,
whose ordinarily helical plan of growth has caused M. D'ORB16xY to range it among his
Hilicosteques, notwithstanding that in fully-developed specimens its mode of growth is
not unfrequently cyclical. The occasional exchange, in this type, of one plan of increase
for the other, at an advanced period of life*, of which exchange I think I have given
adequate evidence (FT 85-87), is a fact which seems to me of yery high interest, being
much more decided in its nature than the corresponding change in Orbitolites. For
whilst in the latter the tendency of the spiral form (whenever it presents itselt) to pass
into the cyclical, is apparent almost from the beginning, and the change is never long
postponed, the helical plan is that on which the growth of the former not only com-
mences, but continues to be carried on, often through the entire period of its increase.

240. It is important to remark that in each case the metamorphosis is simply due to
the very rapid opening-out of the mouth of the spire, its two lateral extremities
extending themselyes round the shell on the one side and on the other, until they meet
and completely enclose the portion previously formed (just as the lobes of the mantle in
the adult Cyprea spread themselves round the shell until they meet on its dorsum) ;
and also that the mutual relations of the chambers of the shell and of- the segments of
