But, without enlarging any farther, at present, on the con-
struction of these instruments, I now proceed to give an account
of the experiments for which they were contrived. Having found abundant reason to conclude, from the results
of the experiments of which an account has already been given,

108 Count Rumrorp's Enquiry concerning the Nature of Heat,

that all the heat which a hot body loses, when it is exposed in
the air to cool, is not given off to the air which comes into con-
tact with it; but that a large proportion of it escapes in rays,
which do not heat the transparent air through which they pass,
but, like light, generate heat only when, and where, they are
stopped and absorbed; I suspected that, in every case. when,
in the foregoing experiments, the cooling of my instruments
was expedited by coverings applied to their metallic surfaces,
those coverings must, by s0me means or other, have facilitated
and accelerated the emission of calorific rays from the hot surface,

Those suspicions implied, it is true, the s1pposition that dif-
ferent substances, heated to the same temperature, emit unequal
quantities of calorific rays; but I saw no reason why this might
not be the case in fact; and I hastened to make the following
experiments, which put the matter beyond all doubt. Exper. No. 12.
