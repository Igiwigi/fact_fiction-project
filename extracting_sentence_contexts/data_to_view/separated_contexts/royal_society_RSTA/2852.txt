to a reasonable accuracy: (1) the CMOD and COD as a function of time are predicted correctly;
(2) the CTOD as a function of time is predicted correctly; (3) the peak load reached is same as
the experimental peak load and is reached at the experimentally observed time; (4) the CTOD at
macroscopic crack growth is predicted correctly and occurs at the experimentally observed time.
