By this device we ascertained that our results
were practically independent of alteration of current strength by alteration of
registance. It occasioned, however, the observation that addition of resistance in
the secondary circuit diminishes the effect of the anode of the induction current
(make or break) far more markedly than that of the kathode, a point which is
illustrated in Tracing 32. We observed a fact of the same kind with the Hexnry modification of the current,
viz.: that on gradually increasing the strength of current by bringing the secondary
nearer to the primary coil, a break positive effect, which appeared with lower strength,
was gradually overtaken by the corresponding make negative effect, which under
certain cireumstances might even surpass the break positive effect with higher
strength (Tracing 33). We found the former phenomenon to be independent of the
nature of the resistance apparatus used, and of its position in the circuit.
