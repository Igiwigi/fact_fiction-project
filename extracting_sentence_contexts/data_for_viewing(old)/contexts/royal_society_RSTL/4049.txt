diminish a little, it could yet be retained at a degree stronger than the weakest, In
fact it was easy to keep the nickel at many of the intermediate degrees of power,
and thus to remove all doubt of the progressive assumption of the full degree of
force.

2348. I have expressed an opinion, founded on the different temperatures at which
the magnetic metals appeared to lose their peculiar power}; that all the metals would
probably have the same character of magnetism if their temperature could be lowered
sufficiently. The facts just described appear to me entirely against such an opinion.
The metals which are magnetic retain a portion of their power after the great change
has been effected, or in what might be called their diamagnetic state ; but the other
metals, such as bismuth, tin, &c., present no trace of this power, and therefore are not
in the condition of the heated iron, nickel, or cobalt ; for in fact whilst these point
axially and are attracted, the others point equatorially and are repelled. I therefore
hope to be allowed to withdraw the view I then put forth.

2349. I next proceeded to examine the peroxides of iron, and in accordance with

artificial, possessed of magnetic power at common temperatures. TI heated them in
