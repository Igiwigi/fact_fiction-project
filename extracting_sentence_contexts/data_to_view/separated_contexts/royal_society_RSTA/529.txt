Note that the theory of mixtures allows for a general formalism containing both Darcy’s 2
law and Brinkman’s law [16-18]. :

More precisely, we denote the number density of tumour cells by n(x, f) and the pressure by
p(x, t), which is given by a pressure law p = I7(n), where JT is an increasing function. We choose
the following ‘compressible’ pressure law, parametrized by k:

k L .
,(n) = mai" k>2. (1.1) :8

The ‘incompressible’ limit is obtained by letting the parameter k go to +oc. In fact, we formally :s
deduce from (1.1) that the limiting graph is given by [7,.(n) =0 for n € [0,1) and J7..(1) € [0, 00) [=
for n = 1. We assume a Brinkman flow, which means that the macroscopic velocity field is given by : aw
VW for a potential W closely related to the pressure. With these assumptions, the model, indexed [8
by k, for tumour growth is :sS

Opn — div(ngV We) = 1G (px) (1.2)

and

— vAWg + Wy = px (x, t) = LT (ng)- (1.3)

The second term of equation (1.2) models the influence of the mechanical pressure.
