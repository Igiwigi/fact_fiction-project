[26]). The main addition of the Galenko-Danilov model to the previous models is that it used
deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium not only at the solid/liquid interface (as the BCT
model), but also in the diffusion field due to the fact that the interface may propagate with a
velocity that is comparable with the characteristic speed of diffusion in bulk liquid [19].

The total undercooling AT at the solid/liquid interface is subdivided in the following
contributions:

AT =ATr + ATc + ATy + ATr + ATx, (3.1)

with the thermal undercooling AT7, the solutal undercooling ATc, the undercooling due to shift
of the kinetic liquidus from the equilibrium liquidus line ATy, the curvature undercooling ATR
and kinetic undercooling ATx. The undercoolings are defined below by equations (3.2), (3.3),
(3.8)-(3.10).
