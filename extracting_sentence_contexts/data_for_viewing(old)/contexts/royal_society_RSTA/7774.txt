Some of the inverse interpolation calculations have been checked independently
by using a direct interpolation formula and a trial and error procedure, but little
time is saved by adopting this method. If a large number of accurate inverse inter-
polations had to be carried out, the desirability of adopting the two-machine method
developed by Comrir (1936) would be worthy of consideration. In view of the fact
that these alternative methods involve the production of differences of the function
to be interpolated, we emphasize the point that the table given provides all the in-
formation required to permit the interpolation of any of the listed functions by using

the reversed series (8-2). We have exemplified the procedure by consideration of inverse
interpolation from F(y), not only because f(y) is the basic computed function, but
also because it is almost exclusively for this function that inverse interpolation will be
required in physical applications. If necessary, the accuracy attainable in inverse
interpolation from the other functions can be determined by an extension of the
