The twelve vertebree following the last thoracic—viz., the 25th to the 36th of the
entire series—are united together by complete concrescence of their centrochondrites,
and’ partial concrescence of their arches, by median longitudinal bands uniting the
unossified neural spines (fig. 186). Both centrosteites and neurosteites are still quite
distinct, and the ilia can be readily removed by maceration, so that there is no difli-
culty in determining the precise number and character of the vertebrae comprised in
the compound sacrum, or, as it may conveniently be termed, syn-sacr'um. As there is
some difference of opinion as to the interpretation of this difficult region, I propose, in
the first instance, to describe the facts as I find them in the specimens now under
discussion, and afterwards to give the conclusions at which I have arrived as to the
classification of the several vertebrae. In the 26th to the 33rd vertebrae the ventral face of the centrum undergoes a
marked flattening, and, as a consequence, the neuro-central suture or synchondrosis is
lowered in position (fig. 186). This is especially the case in the 28th vertebra,* in
which the centrosteite can barely be seen from the side, At the same time the

caudal is marked Cd. (30).
