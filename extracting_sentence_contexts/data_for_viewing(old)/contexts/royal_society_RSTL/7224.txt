OR INTERNAL FRICTION OF AIR AND OTHER GASES. 255

Tn the actual case the motion of the planes is rotatory instead of rectilinear, oscilla-
tory instead of constant, and the planes are bounded instead of infinite.

It will be shown that the rotatory motion may be calculated on the same principles
as rectilinear motion ; but that the oscillatory character of the motion introduces the
consideration of the inertia of the air in motion, which causes the middle portions of
the stratum to lag behind, as is shown in fig. 8, where the curves represent the sncces-
sive positions of a line of particles of air, which, if there were no motion, would be a
straight line perpendicular to the planes.

The fact that the moving planes are bounded by a circular edge introduces another
difficulty, depending on the motion of the air near the edge being different from that of
the rest of the air.

The lines of equal motion of the air are shown in fig. 9.

The consideration of these two circumstances introduces certain corrections into the
calculations, as will be shown hereafter.

In expressing the viscosity of the gas in absolute measure, the measures of all veloci-
ties, forces, &c. must be taken according to some consistent system of measurement.

If L, M, T represent the units of length, mass, and time, then the dimensions of f (a
