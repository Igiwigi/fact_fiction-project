discovery is interesting, as it points to the existence of a fauna similar to that on the
Sicilian coast.

Sicily—On the Atlantic coast, where the successive changes of level haye been
due to earth movements extending over wide areas, there has been little to interfere
with the comparative uniformity in the level of the beaches. But in the Mediter-
ranean area volcanic action has introduced .a disturbing element, which no longer
allows of uniformity of level being accepted as contributory evidence of contemporaneity
of upheaval ; and where we have no other evidence, altitude alone cannot be taken as
a proof of age. This renders the age of some of the beaches in Sardinia and Corsica
uncertain,

In Sicily there is, in fact, proof of considerable uplifts in recent times, According
to Signor Gzmmxnaro,t there are on the coast of Catania several zones of sea-levels
on lava-streams of known date. In one case, the lava-stream of the year 1169 has |
* adhering to it a coarse shelly sand, in which may be distinguished, almost ina normal
position, Cyprea lucida” and other shells, at a height of 6 to 7 feet above the sea-
level, At another spot he found blocks of lava encrusted by Serpule, at a height
of 45 feet.{ This he considered to be the greatest elevation the coast had undergone t
during the present period,

Of bone caves there is one with traces of a Raised Beach 70 feet above sea-level log
two miles north of Syracuse, The cave contained remains of Elephant, Hippo-
potamus, &e. A bone breccia, which Dr, Curistre classed with that of San Ciro,
extended from the entrance to some distance at the base of the cliff.
