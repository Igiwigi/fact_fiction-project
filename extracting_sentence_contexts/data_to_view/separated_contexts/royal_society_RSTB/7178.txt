On the ninth segment the dorsal buds form the paraprocts, which are considered to be in
whole tenth tergite and cerci.

(c) The genital appendages

The female flies have no genital appendages around the vulvar opening. Nevertheless,
the present study supports the view that the genital appendages in the female, when
present, rise from imaginal disks on the eighth and ninth abdominal segments. This con-
clusion is drawn from the fact that the same imaginal disks develop into evaginations which
are the rudiments of the genital appendages, as well as invaginations which are the origin
of the genital ectodermal ducts. This is exactly what happens in the case of the dipterous
males which possess copulatory apparatus. But as the females do not possess such apparatus
the imaginal disks give rise only to the genital ducts.
