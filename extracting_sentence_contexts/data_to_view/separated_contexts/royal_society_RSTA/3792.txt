Ct O= gii4 yy,

Therefore the factors are

2 (608) = 1 — ah8(53" +7), |
- (36). D: (sin) = 1 + gy? (3? — 5) It is easy to verify that the other coefticients of €? and § are in fact reproduced. The notation adopted here and below for distinguishing the cosine and sine factors
is perhaps rather clumsy, but I have not thought it worth while to take distinctive
symbols for the factors in these cases, because they will not be of frequent occurrence. When s = 1,

{o= = [1 $f cos 2g = 4, 67(1 4008 48)] {ore + Bp’s(1 — 48 cos 24) {oe
