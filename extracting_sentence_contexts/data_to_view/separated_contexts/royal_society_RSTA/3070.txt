Will nuclear fusion finally
make good on its promise to become a commercial energy source by then? These are just two
examples of unanswerable questions on future innovation which are relevant for the assessment
of 1.5Â°C pathways. In the face of such deep uncertainty, available pathway modelling takes the
most tenable position of relying on the range of technologies and their learning rates described in
the literature rather than introducing unspecified backstop technologies or fictional proposals. To
go beyond this, it is useful to abstract from the details of individual pathways and associated
technology portfolios. Such an approach of reduced granularity in long-term forecasts was
suggested by Morgan & Keith [18] to explore high-level implications for long-term emissions
strategies in the presence of deep uncertainty.
