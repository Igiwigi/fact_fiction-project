Large-time (i.e. taken at f = 2000) representative dynamics of the heterogenous animal system for different hierarchies of prey behavioural stimuli and
predator strategies (confused versus not confused). The panels of the right column reproduce zoomed views of the selected insets. As usual, arrows indicate the
actual velocity of both prey individuals (dots) and predator (diamond). (Online version in colour.)
