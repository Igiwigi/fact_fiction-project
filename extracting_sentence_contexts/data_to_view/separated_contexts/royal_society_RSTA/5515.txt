The monomers are then retrieved in the form
of alcohols, esters or free acids and in principle can again be fed to a polycondensation reactor
to produce new polymers in virgin quality. It is noteworthy to mention that the methanolysis of
PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) has even been applied on an industrial scale by Hoechst,
Du-Pont and Eastman-Kodak [28]. However, a disadvantage of this process on the one hand
is the recent decline of the price of virgin DMT [29] and on the other hand the fact that in
newly designed PET plants, the direct reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol
is the preferred method [30]. More recently, companies started to practice glycolysis of waste
PET to form the phthalate bis-ethyleneglycol ester or even higher oligomers that can be used
as raw material for PET [31]. More recently, the depolymerization of this type of polymer
by (transfer)hydrogenation is attracting high attention [32].
