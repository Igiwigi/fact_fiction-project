A full informational, complete frequency-domain representation:
Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis

For any data, after the necessary first additive decomposition, we have the expansion given in
equation (1.3). The carrier FM part has been covered in the HSA [7], in which the variation of the
amplitude is implicitly expressed as the temporal modulations of the spectral intensity without
further expansion or conversion into the frequency domain. Thus, this time-frequency analysis is
in fact an incomplete spectral analysis. Here, we are going to concentrate on the variation of the amplitude function, a;(t). In the above
example of multiplicative interaction between the sinusoidal wave and the white noise, the IMFs
of the data (in figure 2b) are given in figure 4a and the corresponding Hilbert spectrum is given
in figure 4b.
