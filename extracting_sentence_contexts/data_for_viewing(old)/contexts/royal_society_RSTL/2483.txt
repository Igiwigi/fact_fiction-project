IN THE DECAPODOUS CRUSTACEA. 361

occasionally walks by means of its thoracic members, now become simple, but more
commonly swims by the motion of its subabdominal fins, which are greatly developed
for this purposeÂ®. In both stages it is therefore a Macroura, but only in the latter
evidently related to the Decapoda.

It will be quite superfluous to enter into a minute detail of the structure of this
Megalope, further than may be collected by a reference to the figure and its accom-
panying explanation.

It must certainly be considered surprising that 80 many curious facts should have
remained until the present time undiscovered ; but still more, that from the first
announcement of metamorphosis no person has attempted to follow it up; s0 that I
have not only the honour of the discoyery, but also the entire merit of having ren-
dered this interesting part of the natural history of the Crustacea nearly complete,
as the announcements in the previous part of this memoir testify, and my subsequent,
memoirs will prove.

The facts connected with the metamorphosis in the Crustacea and the Cirripedes
are indeed s0 much at variance with our previous knowledge, with the dicta of some
of our leading naturalists, and of s0 very extraordinary a nature, that the scepticism
