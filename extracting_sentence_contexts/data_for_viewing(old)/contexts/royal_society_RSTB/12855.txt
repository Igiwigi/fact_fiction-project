edu.pl Plant cells harbour two types of energy organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts.

Despite the fact that both these organelles have their own genomes, the majority of
organellar proteins are nuclear encoded. Thus, to maintain organelle functions
and to coordinate the expression of organellar and nuclear genes specific mechan-
isms have evolved, classified as anterograde and retrograde control. The
anterograde control involves the regulation of organellar gene expression by
nuclear-encoded proteins, whereas retrograde control involves signals originating
from the organelles causing nuclear transcriptional reprogramming [1]. Moreover,
additional interactions exist between mitochondria and chloroplasts involving
either a retrograde signal from one of the organelles modulating the nuclear ante-
rograde control of the other one [2,3], or simultaneous retrograde signals from
both organelles that together affect nuclear gene expression [4]. Apart from the
complex retrograde signalling pathways with the participation of the nucleus,
