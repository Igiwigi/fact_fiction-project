x(t, p) sin 8 ~ 10-4 y(¢, p) sind, (11, 1)
where x(¢,/) is given in various forms in (6, 36)—(6, 45). This function was calculated
as a function of p for a series of values of ¢, and is shown graphically in fig. 3. This figure
shows that the sheet current distribution, which is initially produced on the surface,
rapidly penetrates inwards, reaching a depth of some 200 km. within 5 min, The maxi-
mum current density at first decreases as it penetrates inwards, but after a depth of
about 900 km. is reached (in about 6 hr.) it begins to increase again, being, in fact,
proportional to 1/p. Also the speed with which the point of maximum current density
moves inwards now decreases rapidly, being proportional to p%*. The total induced
current is, of course, continually diminishing, so that the maximum gets sharper and
sharper as it penetrates farther inwards.

The exact calculation of the current distribution corresponding to the actual e, of
the storm-time variations would be tedious, but its general nature and order of magni-
tude can be inferred from the above. The first rapid decrease in e, (corresponding to
the initial increase in the horizontal force) produces a pulse of westward current, which
is transmitted inwards in the way just described. This is followed, within about 4 hr.,
by a much greater increase in ¢,, which produces a correspondingly greater pulse of
eastward current, following the westward one inwards and gradually overtaking it.
