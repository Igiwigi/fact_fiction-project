On a scale of intensity 10 for 14713, they become visible if
their intensity exceeds the value 10/6'44 or 1°55. We may accordingly assume that
it is less. Comparing this investigation with the fact of the existence of an intensity 2°4 on
this scale, for the line \4121 in the “ordinary” spectrum, as in the table, it is evident
that the phenomenon found in the Diffuse series is present here also, and to the same
degree. In the case of nebulz, the Sharp series of Helium is always very weak, but

the line \4713 is well-known.
