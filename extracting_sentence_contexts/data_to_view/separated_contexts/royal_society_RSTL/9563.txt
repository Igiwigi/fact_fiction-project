These facts prove, 1st,
that the general co-ordination of the spines is wholly dependent upon the nerve-centre ;
2nd, that the spontaneity and local reflex irritability are wholly independent of that
centre—they depend entirely upon the external nerve-plexus ; and 3rd, that the
universal nervous connexions revealed in the bristlng movements of the spines, and
which as shown by previously narrated experiments depend upon the hypothetical
internal nerve-plexus, are themselves in nervous connexion with the nervye-centre. For only thus can we explain the long period of shock which remoyal of this centre
entails upon the functions of this supposed internal plexus. Nevertheless, the fact
that these functions are eventually resumed in the general bristling of the spines,
proves that this general communication between the spines is maintained by the direct
conductibility of the supposed internal plexus, and is not of the nature of a reflex in
which the nerve-ring is concerned as a general centre for the responsive, as dis-
tinguished from the co-ordinated, action of the 8pines.

ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF ECHINODERMATA, 877

TaTERATURE. For a general account of the literature on the morphology of the Echinoderms up
to 1872 reference had best be made to Bavpror in * Archives de Zoologie Exp. et
Gen.,” t..i., pp. 176-216,

The observer who first detected the nervous ring in Zchinus was VAN BENEDEN,
who published his description in *L!Echo du Monde Savant' in 1835. A more
detailed description was afterwards given by Kron in MUrLLr's © Archives? in 1841,
which was followed by the well-known investigations of VaLextiN*, L. and A.
