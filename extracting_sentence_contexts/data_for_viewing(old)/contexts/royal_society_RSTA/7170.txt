cancellation in the root-squaring process is severe. The polynomial (2-6) comes from the
particular case n = 8, « = 0-1, A = 1 of this example, and from table 3 it is seen that there
is a loss of two significant figures in many of the coefficients in the third transformation. In
all, seven transformations were required to separate the zeros to four-figure accuracy, and
by that stage nine figures had been lost in about half the coefficients. The zeros of this
polynomial to five decimal places are

—0:29351-40-:14350i, —0-22447-+ 0-45093i, a No estea oe
—0-09004+1-06119i, —0-05086+1-29691i, —0-02567 + 1-47438i, (3-14)
—0-01049 +-1-59630i1, —0-00249 + 1-66712i, |

and would not, on general grounds, be considered to be particularly close together. If, in
fact, the zeros of a given polynomial are much closer than these, their accurate evaluation
becomes a really acute computational problem. For example, in the case n = 8, a = 10,
A = 1 the zeros of f(x) have been calculated to four decimal places as follows:

—0:1324-+0:1360i, —0-0187-+0-2530i, —0-0023 + 0-2926i,
—0-0005-+0-3042i, —0-0001-40-3086i, —0-0000- 0-3107i, (3°15)
—0-0000-+0-3117i, _—0-0000+-0-31221.

Here the root-squaring process fails to determine all the moduli even if twenty figures are
retained in the initial transformations. To solve such a difficult polynomial satisfactorily
it must first be transformed into a more convenient form, by methods discussed later in § 9.
It may be remarked that although the polynomials (3-13) are ill-conditioned in the sense
that arbitrary small changes in the coefficients produce large changes in some of the zeros,
