Zagier’s definition above exhibits functions which fail to be modular in such a way that precisely
offsets their failure to be analytic, and vice versa.

We offer the following explicit example of a quantum modular form, deliberately chosen for
reasons revealed in the next subsection. Let

U(q) = Y(ue(n) = wo(n))q" = Yq: na" | (2.2)

n>1 n=0

be a certain weighted combinatorial generating function for strongly unimodal sequence ranks.
(Precisely, te/o(1) := #{size-n strongly unimodal sequences with even/odd rank}.) Bryson—Ono-
Pitman—Rhoades [20] proved that U(x) := e7/12U (e271) is in fact a quantum modular form
of weight 3/2. Interestingly, the authors showed that / simultaneously exhibits mock modular-
type transformation properties when viewed as a function on H. Generalizations and extensions
of these results related to U have since been established, some of which we discuss in §3 (see
also [3]). Moreover, many quantum modular forms have been studied in addition to U, arising


from diverse areas such as number theory, combinatorics, representation theory, topology and
more [3,19].

(c) Ramanujan’s radial limits revisited

We are now prepared to state, and explain, the following result and its generalization, established
