57. The surfaces were developed with great facility where they corresponded to the

- 8urfaces of freezing. Wherever the liquid disks before described were observed, the

- gurfaces were always easily developed in the planes of the disks. By care I 8ncceeded,

- in some cases, in producing similar effects in surfaces at right angles to the planes of
the disks, but this was very difficult and uncertain.

T think the following new facts have been established in the foregoing paper :â€”

1. The interior of a mass of ice may be melted by radiant heat which has passed
through exterior portions of the substance without melting them.

2. In the dissolation of the ice thus effected, the substance yields by the formation of

& liquid spaces, each possessing the shape of a flower with six petals, a small vacuum being
S formed at the centre of each flower.

EZ 3. These flowers are generally formed in planes parallel to the surface of freezing,
S but some of the specimens of ice examined were divided into prismatic segments by sur-
= faces of discontinuity. Each distinct segment had its own system of flowers arranged in
