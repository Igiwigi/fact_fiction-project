<= close up to or even a little within the next ring, so that ib is in the middle of the space
E enclosed by the hazy blue inside surface of the hollow cone that starts from that ring.
i And by using additional rings this can be made to repeat itself until the whole
S luminous column is segmented into these hollow luminous cones or shells with bright
= rounded heads.
5 The theory which the authors of this paper desire to put forward is, that each of
A these laminous cones or shells is a perfect stria both in function and structure. The
regemblance in appearance is most striking. Tn the luminous shells which we have
Jusb deseribed there is the sxme convex bright outline pointing towards the negative
terminal, and the game hazy blue ill-defined hollow surface turned towards the shell
immediately behind or on the side towards the positive terminal of the tube, and there
are the game dark intervals dividing consecutive shells as divide consecutive striz. In
fact, this segmented discharge presents to us all the familiar phenomena of striated
discharges in which the strize have rounded or conical forms. Moreover, the conical is
not the only type of striz which can be successfully produced in this manner. Tt is
equally possible to form flat or annular strizz by proper adjustments of the air-spark
interval, as explained in page 192. And as these are precisely the forms which natural

strize tend to assume when they deviate from the conical type, ib may be fairly stated
that all the forms of natural strizz can be artificially reproduced : a fact which is
strongly in favour of the identity of the two phenomena.
