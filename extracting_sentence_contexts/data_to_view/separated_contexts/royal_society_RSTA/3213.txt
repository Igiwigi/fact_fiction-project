It thus appears that the freezing-point depression, both for electrolytes such as
KCl and NaCl, and for non-electrolytes such as sugar in dilute solution, may be
expressed by one formula, viz. :—

A
———, = 1:86+CS1,,
N(i+a) s
since in the case of a non-electrolyte like sugar the ionisation is nil, so that « = 0,

and the molecular volume is nearly constant in dilute solution,* so that 61, = 0.

* We are justified in saying that the molecular volume of sugar is nearly constant in dilute solution
owing to the facts :—
(a) That the solution volume of sugar in dilute solution is nearly constant. (+) That the viscosity of dilute sugar solutions is almost a linear function of the concentration. VOL.
