'The mean of seyeral trials gave me 9'-87, the
h, determined by immersing the junction in water of various tem-
peratures, was *01364. Owing to the large surface of the wood as compared with its
capacity for heat, it was affected by the temperature of the eurronnding atmosphere
nearly three times as much as the quarter-inch metal bars. I found, in fact, that during
the time occupied by a swing of the needle, viz. 45‚Äù, one-fifth of the thermal effect was
lost. Adding, therefore, one quarter to 01364, we find *01705 for the thermal effect,
which, it may be observed, errs a trifle in defect, owing to the conduction of a small
portion of heat along the wires of the thermo-electric junction.
