rate of the turbulence cascade. The logic of this approach is simple: in the absence of dissipation
in the inertial range, any energy that is cascaded through it will eventually be dissipated at the
smaller scalesâ€”the exact process of the dissipation need not be known. The research article of
Coburn et al. [22] reviews the main tool in calculating these energy cascade rates, third-moment
theory and proceed to compare these with thermal proton heating using a very large ensemble
of 1h field and particle data intervals from 12 years of ACE spacecraft observations. One of the
most interesting results of this study are that the measured energy cascade rates show highly
intermittent values and statistics. This was briefly touched upon in the earlier review [8] as one
of the sources of temporal intermittency in solar wind observations; borrowed from an idea for
atmospheric turbulence first proposed by Oboukhov [23].

The recognition that MHD plasmas are strongly affected by the magnetic fields that thread
through them is now a well-established fact of plasma physics. Any study which does not
realistically take this essential anisotropic feature of plasmas into account has a significant
shortcoming. Oughton et al. [10] review our current understanding of anisotropy in solar wind
plasma turbulence, both in the inertial range and, crucially, at the kinetic scales of the sub-ion



range. Both spectral and component anisotropy are reviewed. The results show that although
component anisotropy seems to be relatively well supported by observations in both the inertial
and sub-ion ranges, with a broad agreement within the community, the jury is still out on the
resolution of this in the case of sub-ion range spectral anisotropy.

Traditionally, simulations have provided an important and occasionally indispensable tool
