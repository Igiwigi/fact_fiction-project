Figure 11 shows vj = vi, + vo from (iii) of figure 12b
and figs 16-18 of [10] and can be compared with figure 9a. However, bulk wave incidence and
surface wave incidence are quite different in character, hence a visual assessment of a common
behaviour applies but only to some extent.

(c) Closing remark

According to [16], a strip of triangular lattice with free surface boundary admits an edge wave for
out-of-plane motion. In fact, a further study of energy release during brittle fracture in triangular
lattice strips [25] led to an observation that the same wave mode carries most of the energy release
[26]. In the present paper, an analysis of such surface wave motion on triangular lattice half-space,
associated with the faces of a semi-infinite crack, is presented. The problem formulation follows
the discrete Sommerfeld diffraction problem [10] for bulk lattice waves.
