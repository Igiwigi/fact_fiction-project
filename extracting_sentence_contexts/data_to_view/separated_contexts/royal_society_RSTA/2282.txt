Another interesting rigorous approach is to reduce
the n-plate problem to the solution of a simple ordinary differential equation [42], here the
practical difficulty lies in finding some constant parameters of this ODE. A common theme
in many approaches is the successive treatment of diffraction events to yield Schwarzschild
diffraction series; our implementation may be interpreted as recovering a diffraction series
solution in the spectral domain (Fourier space). The fact that the proposed method is devised
in the spectral domain rather than in the physical space is key. This allows to take advantage of
the singularity structures of the kernel in the complex plane and hence perform hundreds rather
than one or two iterations, see §3c. Significantly, the proposed method applies to some Wiener-
Hopf problems arising in crack propagation or Lévi processes, which are not related to diffraction
and where a Schwarzschild diffraction series approach would not be a natural choice.
