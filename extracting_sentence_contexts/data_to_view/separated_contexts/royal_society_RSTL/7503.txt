'= In 1824 M. Poiss8on communicated two Memoirs to the French Institute, in the
Sfirst of which he propounded a mathematical theory of transient induced magnetisxm
Sfounded on the physical theory of CouLows, that by induction each particle of soft iron
.Sbecomes a magnet, having an intensity proportional to that of all the forces which act
-Zon it, including the force of the magnetism developed by induction in all the other
particles of the mass. In a subsequent Memoir, published in 1839, © Sur les Deviations
Sde la Boussole produites par le fer des vaisseaux,” M. Poiss0N adapted his formulz to
*>observations made on shipboard in the particular case of the 8oft iron being symmetri-
Seally distributed on either side of the principal section of the ship. The memoir was
Saccompanied by a practical application and verification of the theory, showing the
Saccordance of the calculated results with the facts recorded in the Arctic voyages of
Z1818, 1819, and 1820, spoken of above. A careful examination of the disturbances of
x the needle in the © Erebus” and © Terror ' in their passage from England to the Cape of
& Good Hope in 1839, showed that in both ships they were occasioned chiefly, if not
ZE wholly, by the magnetizm induced in the iron of the fittings and equipment by the
S yertical part of the earth's force, and which was distributed symmetrically on either side
E of the fore-and-aft vertical section passing through the compass. In the case of these
= ships, therefore, M. Porssox's method of analysis was strictly applicable; and its practical
application was greatly facilitated by a memorandum drawn up by Mr. ARCHIBALD SMITH,
F.R.S., with which he obligingly supplied me, and which was printed in the provisional
discussion of the observations of Sir Jaups Ross's expedition in the first year of the
Survey, in the V.th Number of these Contributions (Philosophical Transactions, 1843,
