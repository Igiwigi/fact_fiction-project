MR. W. C. D. WHETHAM ON IONIC VELOCITIES. 341

The agreement between. Dr. Lopar’s observed value for the velocity of hydrogen
and that deduced by Koutrausce is too close to be accidental, but some further
experiments in which the velocities of various ions were determined by watching the
formation of precipitates as they travelled along did not give such good results.
Thus, Dr. Lopez found Ba = ‘00012, Sr = ‘00015, and Cl = Br =I = -00024
centims. per second, while Kontravscu gives Ba = ‘00033, Cl = -00053, I = -00060
(‘ Wied. Ann.,’ vol. 6, p. 206).

There are several disadvantages in this method. The greatest appears to be the
impossibility of keeping the solutions of a definite strength—the mere fact of pro-

ducing a precipitate must withdraw a certain amount of salt from the sphere of action,
“and so reduce the strength of the solution. This will increase the resistance of that
portion of the tube in which the precipitate has been formed, and the potential
