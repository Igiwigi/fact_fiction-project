IN the deltas and estuaries of rivers that are of great extent, and which flow through
countries of varied geological structure, we naturally expect to find the remains of
terrestrial yertebrated animals that have been transported by the currents from far-dis-
tant lands, in a more or less mutilated state ; the skeletons broken up—the bones dis-
severed, fractured, and waterworn—the teeth detached from the jaws and dispersed—
and all these separated parts promiscuously imbedded in the mud, silt, and sand of
the delta, and intermingled with the debris of the flora of the country, and the
durable remains of fishes, mollusks, and crustaceans, that inhabited the freshwater, or
were denizens of the adjacent sea. Such is the condition in which the bones and
teeth of oviparous quadrupeds are found in the Wealden formation of the south-east
of England ; and hence the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory evidence of the form
and structure of the extinct reptiles whose relics are s0 abundant in some of these
deposits. To this cause may be ascribed the remarkable fact, that although several hundred
teeth, belonging to seven or eight genera of Saurians, have been collected from these
fluviatile strata, scarcely a portion of the cranium, and but a few fragments of the
Jaws, have been discovered. Every relic of this kind is consequently in the highest
degree interesting, and it is therefore most gratifying to me to have it in my power
to lay before the Royal Society a considerable portion of the lower jaw, with teeth,
of an Iguanodon, recently obtained from a quarry near Cuckfield in Sussex ; the
locality in which, nearly thirty years since, I first discovered the teeth of this colossal
herbivorous Lizard. In the communication which I had the honour to address to this Society in 1841 *,
a fragment of the lower jaw of a Saurian was described as that of a young Ignano-
don, and the anatomical considerations which led me to offer that interpretation
were fully detailed.
