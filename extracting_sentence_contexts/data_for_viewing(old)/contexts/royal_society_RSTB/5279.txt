This species, previously recorded from Kak and Ikorfat, was obtained in 1921 from
Upernivik Naes, Pagtorfik, and Kaersuarssuk. he leaves vary in length from 11 mm.
to 20 mm. and in breadth from 1-7 to 2-5 mm.

Scrapopirytss (?) Axis. Plate 10, fig. 95.

The specimen shown in fig. 95 consists of a flattened axis with regular grooves and
ridges, and long internodes separated by nodes bearing clusters of linear leaves. At the
upper node there are two imperfectly preserved leaves, while at the lower there are
indications of 3-4 leaves. Leaf-scars are seen at each node, but the preservation is
too poor to afford evidence of the occurrence of scale-leaves or short shoots, and it is not
possible to identify the leaves with certainty. The association of leaves apparently
agreeing with S. Hirikiana and the fact that similar leaves are attached lead me to regard
the specimen as a branch of Sciadopitytes. ‘The upper internode is narrower than the
lower, a feature recalling branches of the recent Sciadopitys in which, as Mr. WALTON
pointed out to me, there is a considerable reduction in the amount of vascular tissue from
one internode to the next above.
