NAVe:=NAVO Ze with Se:=H-\(E) (EeR)
are Borel sets, with NAVE © Ze being of Liouville measure og(NAV.e) = 0.

So in this case, the asymptotic velocities (1.3) exist almost everywhere.
Theorem 2.8 of §2 analyses the set NAV for n € N particles in arbitrary dimension d, interacting
via long-ranged potentials.

(a) Content

In §2, we will introduce some notation and present the main ideas of the proof. A non-
deterministic kinematical model for the asymptotics of those orbits, whose asymptotic velocity
does not exist, is exhibited in §3. That the dynamics is in fact well described by that model, will be
shown in §4. The proof of our main result is based on a Poincaré section method devised in [10].
The corresponding estimates form the content of the final §5.


2. Almost sure existence of asymptotic velocity

(a) Some general notation

In general, for a C!—vector field X: P—> TP on a manifold P, we denote its maximal flow by ®.
Then
@€C'(D,P) with domain D:= {(t,x) €R x P| te (T~(x),Tt(x))} (2.1)
