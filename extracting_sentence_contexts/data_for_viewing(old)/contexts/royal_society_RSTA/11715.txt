thus, as on change of density (distance)~* varies directly as density, the character of
the arrangement of the molecules being supposed unaffected, the force due to the
molecules surrounding the point is proportional to #X density, that is, it is equal

which may or may not hold good for a solution or a chemical compound.

19. The value of \, namely $7, which has here been assumed, is not merely
dictated by the form desired for the final result. That value has in fact already
been specified as the first approximation in quite another connexion.* As this is
the crucial point of the theory, it may be allowable to present the argument in
detail. ‘The total electric force acting on a single molecule is derived from the
aggregate potential V = & (pu, d/da 4- py, d/dy + p,d/dz) r-1, where pr, py, pf: are
the components of the moment p of a polarized molecule. This potential, when the
point considered is inside the polarized medium, involves the actual distribution of
the surrounding molecules; and thus the force derived from it changes rapidly at
any instant of time, in the interstices between the molecules. But when the point
considered is outside the polarized medium, or inside a cavity formed in it whose
dimensions are considerable compared with molecular distances, the summation in
the expression for V may be replaced by continuous integration ; so that, (/", g’, h’)
being the intensity of polarization in the molecules of the dielectric,
