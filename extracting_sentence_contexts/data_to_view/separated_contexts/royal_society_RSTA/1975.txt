Density profiles at two different non-dimensional times for both polymers (PS and ABS) for Re = 0.05. The grey area
represents the solid boundary, while the red one is representative of the fluid. (Online version in colour.)

both for PS and ABS are synthetically reported in table 5. Another important comparison can
be made by looking at the evolution of the free surface over time; this analysis, in fact, can
give important feedback about the jet evolution inside the domain by underlining the effects
of different Reynolds numbers for both the considered polymers. For the sake of fluency, only
two configurations will be analysed in figure 9. More specifically, results have been reported in
figure 9 for Re = 0.05 with respect to the non-dimensional time defined as t* = D/c, where D is the
labyrinth inlet diameter and Â¢ is the average injection velocity, as per its definition in table 4.
