Already
in Echidna this process has been initiated for both nuclei. The cerebral peduncles are peculiar in that they contain no representative of the
fronto-pontine fibres of other mammals and that the pyramidal tracts lie exposed
at their medial border. It has been emphazised that the substantia nigra is confined
to the medial border of the peduncle in close association with the pyramidâ€”a fact
which accords with its supposed motor function. In the figures which Hines shows
of this region in Ornithorhynchus the substantia nigra similarly lies at the medial
border of the peduncle. CEREBELLUM OF ECHIDNA ACULEATA 53

Scuusrer (1910) mapped the cortical pattern in Echidna and was unable to differ-
entiate more than five areas (he does not describe the occipital region).
