This fact alone is already suggestive but it becomes even more suggestive
when combined with the realization that the chemical and physical properties of sodium are also
intermediate between those of lithium and potassium. It therefore appears that a relationship
between atomic weights is able to capture a relationship between the properties of different
elements. In retrospect, Débereiner had essentially discovered chemical periodicity since what underlies
the existence of triads is the fact that sodium and potassium occur are regular distances away
from lithium in terms of the sequence of increasing atomic weights. But of course Débereiner did
not produce a periodic table but only the discovery of several disconnected triads. Another powerful hint which was to take a longer time to reach full fruition was the discovery
made by the Scottish physician William Prout, who was working in London.
