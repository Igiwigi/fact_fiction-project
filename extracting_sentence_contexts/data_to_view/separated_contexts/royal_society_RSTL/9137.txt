Z These are the only two species T found on the island, but Sir Henry Barkly has
Zent home figures of two (and of one a specimen) other species from the island. These
Are P. wtilis, Bory, and P. odoratissimus, Linn, f. His figures and specimen of the
-Jormer are most distinetly those of P. Â»tilis, Bory, but whilst T do not dispute the
Fact that this plant may have existed or may exist on the island, T may notice that
ir Henry Barkly's drawing and specimen are of a tree grown in the Botanic Garden
In Mauritius from $eeds which Mr. Duncan is said to have brought from
Rodriguez. T think this takes away considerably from the value of the observation,
Zspecially as the trees Mr. Horne pointed out to me as from Rodriguez are growing
Flosely surrounded by Mauritius ones. At the same time I may remark that in the
Foung state, hefore many branches have been given off, P. v/ilis, Bory, and P.
Fieterocarpus, Balf.
