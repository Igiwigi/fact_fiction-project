\ 3. Influence of the permanent action of Magnetism on conducting bodies traversed by
interrupted electric currents,

Faravar's brilliant discovery of the action exerted by magnetism on a ray of pola-
rized light, when that ray traverses a transparent body submitted to the action of a
powerful electro-magnet, had no sooner been announced by its illustrious author, than
the majority of philosophers saw in it a proof that magnetism, when at a high degree
of intensity, has power to modify the molecular constitution of all bodies. They con-
sequently attributed the phenomenon observed by Farapay, not to the direct action
of the electro-magnet on the polarized ray, but to the modification effected by this
action on the molecular constitution of the substance traversed by the ray. I was
of this opinion, and communicated it to Mr. Farapay, who alludes to it in his memoir.
Desirous, howeyer, of founding this opinion on facts of a different kind, I asked
myself if it were not possible to find in the electric current, an agent capable of per-
forming the same function for opake conducting bodies that polarized light does for

transparent ones. I had stated in my paper on the sound emitted by iron wires tra-
versed by interrupted electric currents, that the nature as well as the intensity of the
sounds were singularly modified by the molecular state of the wire snbmitted to the
experiment. I had particularly mentioned the influence of temper and annealing,
of greater or less tension, and of temperature. I had shown that iron wire, when
under the influence of an action which renders it magnetic, does not emit the same
