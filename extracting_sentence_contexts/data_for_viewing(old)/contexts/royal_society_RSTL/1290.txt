the nitrogen of one part of the volatile alkali. Accordingly,
when the excess of oxygen is removed by sulphuret of lime,

* The result of this experiment shews, moreover, that eyen supposing oxygen to
be a constituent of ammonia, we are not- to expect its eyolution, in a separate form,
by electricity ; since, when electrified with ammoniacal gas, oxygen gas is deprived
of its elastic form, and its base is condensed into water, by union with nascent hy-
drogen evolved from the alkali,

+ In some cages I haye-observed, that when the cloud does not occur immediately,
it may be made to appear by agitating the quicksilyer contained in, the detonating
tube. This is probably owing to the disengagement of some ammonia, which had
lodged in the mercury. The fact confirms what I haye already suggested, respecting
the cause of the yariable proportion of gases, eyolyed from amunonia by electricity.

the nitrogen generally falls short of the proportion, which
ought to accrue from a given weight of ammonia; and hence
it is scarcely possible to attain, when a considerable excess of
oxygen is used, an accurate analysis of the volatile alkali.
