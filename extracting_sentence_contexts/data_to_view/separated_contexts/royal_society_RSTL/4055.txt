DTherefore Systems of Thiipsinomic Axes coincide with the corresponding systems of
” Tasinomic Axes. Z 17. Platythliptic Coefficients are negative.

It may be observed as a matter of fact, that in consequence of the largeness of
-2 the Euthytatic Coefficients (z*), (Þ*), (4), as compared with the other Tasinomic
Coefficients, the Platythliptic Coefficients (bc), (ca), (ab) are generally, if not always,
S negative. ZZ To illustrate this, the case of Pantatic Isotropy may be taken, for which the two
E matrices have the following forms ;—

s (&) (8) (&y) 0 O © || (@) (be) (be) 0 oO 0
2 (&) &© (@&) o oO © | (bo) (&) (be) 0 oO O

from which it is easily scen that the sole Platythliptic coefficient has the following
value:

(be)=Tmrt a7) =2p77 rat rare rn EET
The denominator of this fraction is always positive 80 long as (#*) exceeds (37) ; a
condition invariably fulfilled by solid bodies, and, in fact, necessary to their exist-
ence.
