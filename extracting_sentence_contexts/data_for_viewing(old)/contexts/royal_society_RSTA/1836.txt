theory extends the renormalization procedure of the Casimir stress in inhomogeneous planar
media [47] to spatially uniform, time-dependent materials. Direct measurements of the Casimir
force inside planar media are difficult, the easiest is perhaps a test of the extreme behaviour
predicted in [56]. But one could emulate Casimir forces with other fluctuations, as long as they
have a similar spectrum than the vacuum fluctuations, replacing the f in the Casimir force by

an effective noise parameter of significantly larger magnitude, which would enhance the effect. : =
Measuring Casimir forces in time-dependent media is not simple either. Here also analogues may : =
play an important role for crucial tests. 13
While the physics of the Casimir effect of separate bodies is well understood, the Casimir : =
force inside materials has remained a fairly underdeveloped subject. There is enormous scope 8
for research in both theory and experiment. If the Lifshitz theory of the cosmological constant : o
[57] does indeed agree with the astronomical facts in detail, either directly or after minor 1
modifications, it would not only shed light on a rather dark subject in cosmology, but also : S
motivate a better understanding of the forces acting on the nanoscale in the everyday world. : 8
