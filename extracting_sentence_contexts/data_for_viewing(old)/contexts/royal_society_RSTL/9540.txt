then the 12 factors are in fact all those of II, except ab, cf, de ; viz., we have

Again, c,cgk;ky,=vacf.bde Vbef.ade /acdef beds, is a fourth root of a product of
32 factors, which are in fact 16 factors twice repeated, and in the 16 factors, ab does
not occur, cf and de occur each twice, and the other 12 factors each once : we thus
have
