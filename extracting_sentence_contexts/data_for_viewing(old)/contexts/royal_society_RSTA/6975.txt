6. Biharmonic finite-difference equations for rectangular boundaries

The usual finite-difference equation for the numerical solution of equations of the type
(I. 7) is that given as equation (B. 1). For all points except those adjacent to the rectangular
boundary, this equation involves only points on and internal to the boundary, while at points
adjacent to the boundary one line of external (fictitious) points is involved. The most usual
and important pair of boundary conditions is given by

dw/dv = g(x,);

and the second of these enables the fictitious points to be obtained in terms of internal and
boundary points. In previous applications of relaxation methods to the biharmonic equation
(Fox & Southwell 1941), the simplest possible approximation, involving the neglect of third
differences, has been used for the derivative condition, and no attempt has been made to
assess the error of equation (B. 1). The second source of error, starting with the sixth differ-
ence, is usually small compared with the neglect of third and higher differences at the
boundary. The latter is likely to be really serious, since the boundary is the place where the
biharmonic solution is least well behaved in the computational sense.

It is therefore suggested, just as in the case of second-order equations, that the fictitious
point be obtained in terms of internal and boundary points by the use of more accurate
