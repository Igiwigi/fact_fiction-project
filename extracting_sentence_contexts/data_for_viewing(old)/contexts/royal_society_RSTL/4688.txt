In making these preparations, the two following methods were adopted :â€”a per-
fectly fresh chord was hardened in spirits of wine, s0 that extremely thin sections, in
various directions, could be made by means of a very sharp knife. A section s0
made was placed on a glass slide and treated with a mixture composed of one part
of acetic acid and three of spirits of wine, which not only makes the nerves and
fibrous portion more distinct and conspicuous, but renders also the grey substance
much more transparent. The section was then covered with thin glass, and viewed,

* At the time these inquiries were begun, and nearly up to the period of their completion, I had not scen any
of the works of Dr. STiLLixG, and knew no more of his investigations into the structure of the spinal chord
than what I had gathered from the anatomical and physiological works published .in this country. However
nearly, therefore, a few of the facts brought forward in this paper may correspond to the results of his in-
quiries, I may state that they were made out without any knowledge of Dr. STiLLIxG's views, excepting only
those which regard the origin of the spinal nerves. On showing some of my preparations to Mr. SouLy and
Mr. GrarixGer, I was advised by those gentlemen to look over the works of Dr. STILLING ; and having done
80, I shall refer to them whenever they appear to oppose, or coincide with, my own observations.
