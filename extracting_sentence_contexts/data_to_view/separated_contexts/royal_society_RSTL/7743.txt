The foregoing quantities (>z, 3y, . . .) are termed the increments.

66. Consider a k-fold relation between the m+1T coordinates (, y, ...), &  m; the
increments (3, 3y, . . .) are connected by a linear -fold relation. The linear /-fold relation is satisfied if we assume the increments proportional to the
coordinatesâ€”this is, in fact, assuming that the point remains unaltered, We may write
(3x, dy, . . .)=(x, y, - - -), 8ince in such an equation only the ratios are attended to. But it
may be preferable to write (3z, 3y, . ..)=a(&, y,. . .). Tn particular if k=m, then the
increments are connected by a linear m-fold relation; that is, the ratio of the increments
is uniquely determined; and as the relation is satisfied by taking the increments propor-
tional to the coordinates, it is clear that the yalues which the linear m-fold relation gives
for the increments are in fact proportional to the coordinates: viz. there is not in this
case any consecutive point.
