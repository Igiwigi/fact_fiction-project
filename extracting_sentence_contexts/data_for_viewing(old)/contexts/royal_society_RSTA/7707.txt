the number of the random variables is n = 2. Suppose that it is known for certain
that

P (i, %4|9;, 93) = 2, — 6,0, +306, for 0O< 4%, x, andx,+%* = 6,| (70)

Pp (X1, %|9, 92) =O for any other system of values of the x’s. |

As to the parameters 0, and 04, it is known only that 0, > 0 and — 1 < 0,°6, = 2.
The sample space W is limited to the first quadrant of the plane of the x’s, and its
positive part, W,, (0,), corresponding to any fixed value of 6,, is formed by a triangle
as suggested in fig. 4.

In order to see at once the difficulties introduced by the fact that the probability
law (70) depends upon two parameters, while we are interested in one only, let us
try to solve the problem of confidence intervals by a guess. In Example I, the more

* This point will be discussed later. See pp. 370 et seq.


STATISTICAL ESTIMATION 363

satisfactory confidence intervals were determined by regions of acceptance belonging
to S;, having their internal boundary similar to that of the external, the latter being
also the external boundary of W., (0).
