The direct power of communication is enfeebled by the
ether, and the motion obtained indirectly cannot make good the loss. We are thus led
to the conclusion that the best radiators ought to prove themselves the worst con-
ductors. A broad consideration of the subject shows that the conclusion is in general harmony
with observed facts. Organic substances are all exceedingly imperfect conductors of
heat, and they are all excellent radiators. The moment we pass from the metals to
their compounds we pass from a series of good conductors to bad ones, and from a series
of bad radiators to good onesÂ®.
