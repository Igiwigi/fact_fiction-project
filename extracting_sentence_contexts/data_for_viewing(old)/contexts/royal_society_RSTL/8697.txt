44. It will be remarked, as regards all the theorems, that we do not start with known
limits; we start with V a function of (4... c, e), the coordinates of the attracted point,
satisfying certain prescribed conditions, and we thence find e, a function of the coordinates
(T...2) or (#...2,w), as the case may be, which function is found to be =0 for
values of (z...2) or (z... z, w) lying beyond certain limits, and to have a determinate
non-eyanescent value for values of (z.. . 2) or (@. .. 2, w) lying within these limits ; and
we thus, as a result, obtain these limits for the limits of the multiple integral V.

45. Thus in theorem A, in the example where the limiting equation is ultimately
found to be a*... +2*=f?, we start with V a certain function of a. . . + (=z* suppose)
and &, viz. V is a function of these quantities through 9, which denotes the positive root
of the equation
the value in fact being v=I"rn(t+: -/*)>#4t, and the resulting value of e is found to
be =0 for values of (@... 2) for which a*. .. +:*>f*. Hence V denotes an integral

\ _c _edv...ds _
{(a—a)...+(o—2Y+&p7*Y
the limiting equation being a*. . . +2*=f?, say this is the s-coordinal sphere.
And _—_— in the examples where the limiting equation is ultimately found to be
x2

FAT + E=1, we start with V a certain function of @,...c,e through 0 (or directly

and through 0), where 0 denotes the ru root of the equation
