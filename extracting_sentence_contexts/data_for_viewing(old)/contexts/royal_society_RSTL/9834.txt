being known, the inner pair could be used as reference lines for colours in their
immediate neighbourhood. On one occasion, four measures, each made on a single
ring, gave 431, 429, 431 and 438 millionths of a millimetre as the wave length
respectively ; on another occasion two measures gave 432 and 438. As none of
these numbers differ from their mean by more than 1'2 per cent. these measure-
ments enable us to estimate the accuracy of the method. Red glass (coloured with
oxide of copper) was used in the game way, and two measures agreed in giving
the wave length as 615. In the case of the blue of the second order the difficulty
was much increased by the fact that the boundary of a colour 80 near the centre
of the rings is very irregular. If we except this tint, however, no measurement
ever differed from the mean of the measures on the same colour by more than
1:6 per cent. As three sets of measurements were taken at intervals of nine and
six months respectively, and as in most cases three, and in some five, observations
were made in each colour, it seems that the errors of recognition and measurement
combined did not (except in the case mentioned) exceed 1'6 per cent.

Side by side with these experiments, which were purposely made at long intervals
to test the constancy of the colour estimations, other supplementary observations
were made upon the films themselves. The scale of colour ab firs used was obtained
by assigning to each tint the thickness ascribed to that of the same name in NewrToN's
second scale, and adjusting the boundaries 80 that the number thus assigned to any
