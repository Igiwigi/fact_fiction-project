In this genocentric view of
inheritance, early in life environmental effects can strongly affect an organism
for its whole lifespan, but such effects cannot percolate into the next generation. The fantastic technological developments of molecular biology since the 1990s,
although entirely placed within this view, eventually led to the finding that the
accounting of the sole genetic variation does not explain inheritance in all its
complexity [2]. That finding triggered major debates, notably about missing
heritability, the fact that estimates of heritability in population genetics or epi-
demiology are almost always much higher than those obtained in genome-wide
association studies [3—7]. The ubiquity of this discrepancy on its own suggests
that a genes-only view of heredity may be far from sufficient to explain trait
inheritance. In parallel, ever since the early days of neo-Darwinism and even more so
since the mid-2000s [3,8—10], evidence mainly coming from molecular studies
