suspicion of their being metallic. The salifiable bases might
be considered either as protoxides, deutoxides, or tritoxides :
and the general relations of salifiable matter, to acid matter,
might be supposed capable of being ascertained by their rela-
tions to oxygene, or by the peculiar state of their electrical
energy. The whole tenour of the antiphlogistic doctrines, necessarily
points to such an order; but in considering the facts under
other points of view, solutions may be found, which if nor 80
simple, account for the phanomena, with at least equal facility. If hydrogene, according to an hypothesis to which I have
often referred, be considered as the principle which gives
inflammability, and as the cause of metallization, then our list
of simple substances will include 9xygene, hydrogene, and
unknown bases only ; metals and inflammable solids will be
compounds of these bases, with hydrogene ; the earths, the
fixed alkalies, metallic oxides, and the common acids, will be
compounds of the same bases, with water,

The strongest arguments in favour of this notion, in addition
to those I have before stated, which at present occur to me,
are, First. The properties which seem to be inherent in certain
bodies, and which are either developed or concealed, accord-
ing to the nature of their combinations.
