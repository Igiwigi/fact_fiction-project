This conclusion seems to us to
apply not only to the two families referred to above, but to all other Ostariophysem
about which reliable information can be obtained, and to warrant the exclusion of
phonation from further consideration in connection with the Weberian mechanism:

With regurd to respiration the air-bladder in different Fishes is said to be reluted
to this function in one of two ways, acting either asa lung subsidiary to the gills, or
is an oxygen reservoir

There is no satisfactory evidence that respiration can be effected by the transit of

SOorrsey's ingenions theory that the extrinsic muscles of the air-bladder in the Pimelodinw and the

aie lo and trom the air-blidder through the ductus poeinaticos in any Physostemi-
Muy Fishes frequently resort to the surlace and swallow wir, which may either act
directly ou the gills, or on uecessory respiratory organs, but the somewhat prevalent
inpression (hut some Physostomi are capable of inhaling air through the pneumatic
dit vests upon no satisfietory foundation and way be dismissed from eonsideration.*

Ov the other hand, there is » large body of experimental evidence for the belief
thot the air bladder has an important, though secondary, relation to respiration by
wehiig os u reservoir for jhe superabandance of oxygen which is taken into the blood
through the gills, and subsequently re-absorbed from the wir-bladder into the blood
when the Fish is in water containing but little of that gus in solution It seems
lear, névertheless, that, however important this secondary relation of the au-bladder
to respiration may be in Fishes in general, there van be no physiological conection
between it and the Weberian mechanism. The function of the air-bladder as aa
oxygen veservoir is, to say the least, as characteristic of those Wishes in which a
Weberian invchanism is absent, as if is of those in which it is present. In fact,
Morgan's researches go much firther than this, and prove to the point of actual
demonstration that of the Fishes with which he experimented those provided with a
Weberian mechanism had relatively but little expucity for absorbing oxygen fiom the
ai-bladder, when placed under conditions likely to cause asphyxia, 4, in water
deprived of its oxyyen, whereas mauy otber Fishes belonging both to the Physoclist
ind Dhysostome divisions of the Teleostei, in which the Webevian apparatus is
wating, had a far greater capacity for absorbing oxygen under similar conditions
than the former. Morpav has also shown that a marked capacity for oxygen absorp-
tion is ulways associated with the presence of retia mirabilia in the walls of the air-
Tladder, and these structures, as we have already pointed out, ave invariably absent
in all Siluridm, and, so furas we are acquainted, in all the remaining Ostariophyses. Dismissing respiration, we may next consider the much more dificult and debatable
question whether these structures can be regarded as in any way subsidiary to the
function of audition,

Our knowledge of the pliysiology of hearing is mainly confined to the higher air-
breathing Vertebrata, and ljut comparatively little is experimentally ov certainly
kuown at present about this function in Pishes.
