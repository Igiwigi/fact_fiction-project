the larvee were entirely lacking.

This was, generally speaking, the result of the work of the ‘“ Margrethe” on her
cruise to the West Indies. It had been intended to spend the winter in fisheries
investigations at St. Thomas, and then, following up the work of the outward voyage
of the “ Margrethe,” to continue the eel investigations during the voyage home in
spring. Fate, however, ordered otherwise ; the ‘‘ Margrethe ” ran aground on one of
the West Indian islands and was wrecked.

The collections, fortunately, were saved, but here we were at St. Thomas with no
ship. The only thing to be done for the moment was to endeavour to press forward
the work being done from the trading vessels. We had now, of course, some definite
facts to go upon, We knew that the tiny larvee were to be sought during the first
half of the year, and the record specimen of only 17 mm. length, already frequently
referred to, would also be a good guide. I was now able to issue instructions far more
precise in character than hitherto, both as regards time and place, and also the depth,

to be chosen for fishing. Through the very generous co-operation of the East Asiatic
Company of Copenhagen, a considerable number of hauls were taken in the spring and
summer of 1914 by steamers of this line on the West Indies route, and these did not
fail to produce their result. As early as June, the 8.5. “ Bintang” and 8.8, “Samui”
brought us plankton samples, taken in May and June about lat. 20° N., long. 55° W.,
all of which were found to contain larve of the European eel, for the most part tiny
stages. At one of the stations for instance (Station 789, 8/5, 1914) seven specimens
of the following lengths were taken: 9, 9, 11, 16, 16, 16, 21 mm., #.e., an average of
