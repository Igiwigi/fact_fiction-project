(v) Summary of the fauna of the middle division

Lithologically the middle division (grades 1-5) is divided into two rhythmic phases
separated by a small oscillation (to grade 3, see figure 7a). In both phases small, rather
elongate, shells are finally followed by exclusively large and relatively high shells.

Band A, 7 ft. thick, occupies most of the lower phase. Within it, with upward coarsening
in grain size of the shale (from grade 2 almost to grade 5), there is a progressive increase in
the modal H/L ratio of the shells from 42-4 to 48-4 and 51 % (for large and small shells
respectively). This increase is continued to 64 % in band B (grades 4 and 5, see figure 7a)
at the top of the lower rhythmic phase. Detailed work in band A shows that the increase
is not always perfectly smooth. The following facts however are clear:

(2) With upward modal increase in H/L ratio there is also an increase in the mean A/L
ratio: this is continued also to band B.

(6) There is typically, but not invariably, a slight increase in shell size upwards in the
unit. Although this may account partly for the increase in H/L ratio it is certainly not
entirely responsible for it.

(c) The fauna is dominantly Anthraconaia-like at the base of the band, the forms apparently
