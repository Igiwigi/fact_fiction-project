to state that it arises from direct action on the centre. Far more probably it is a
reflex from the subcutaneous tissues or the result of imperfect aération due to the
partial obstruction of the trachea. In any case it is of small importance.

The first striking change in the respiration observed is the diminution in the depth.
The movement of the abdomen on inspiration becomes less marked and soon is
confined to the anterior half of the belly. Later the thoracic inspiratory movement
becomes unusually obvious, and may in fact play a greater part than the abdominal.
The expiratory movement of the belly becomes marked and the nostrils show laboured
breathing. All these indications of deficient aération are remarkably weak, so that
they form a contrast to the laboured breathing of ordinary asphyxia, and the presence
of various weak movements in the thorax and abdomen gives the impression of a lack
of co-ordination of the respiratory muscles. On close examination, however, one can
satisfy oneself that no real in-codrdination is present but merely weak efforts to attain
a more satisfactory inflation. Not infrequently any one respiratory movement is seen
to consist of a short jerk contraction, though this is often concealed by some different
movement following closely on it. Thus the quick short diaphragmatic contraction
gives way to a rapid relaxation but this may be obscured by the contraction of the
expiratory abdominal muscles. At this time the rate of the respiration may not depart
much from the normal, or it may be somewhat quicker. As the weakness of the move-
