The individual tangential walls
formed at each division have undergone only a negligible part of this extension and
so cannot be treated by argument along the present lines. It seems reasonable to
suggest, however, that since these walls undergo such little extension, very little
change in the direction of their fibrils will take place. This is, in fact, found to be
so; there is no change in fibrillar direction on tangential walls of tracheids from
year to year. Since the formula for the tracheid is here developed from that of the
initial the test which is made later of this formula is necessarily a test of that applying
to the initial. Certain details of the development of tracheids from cambial initials
will be neglected in the development of these considerations. â€˜Their investigation,
which would make the present argument unnecessarily lengthy, has been left to the
final discussion.
