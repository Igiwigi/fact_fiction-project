This, to a cer-
tain extent, is unquestionably true; but it does not follow that
each metal which produces contraction or expansion, when
added to others, should (as some have supposed) constantly
produce similar effects, corresponding to the relative proportion
of that particular metal; for we well know that some metals, in
like manner, promote the fusibility of others in a much greater
degree than could be expected from their natural or inherent
fusible property ; but then, the maximum of this effect is pro-
duced by certain proportions of the different metals, and suffers
diminution by any variation in these proportions, It appears,
therefore, that this great degree of fusibility, is a property pecu-
liar to the compound, which cannot immediately be attributed
to either of the component metals; and I am much deceived, if
those alterations in specific gravity which, in like manner, are
observed in the various metallic compounds, will not admit of
a similar explanation; for, in respect to the contraction or ex-
pansion which takes place in consequence of combination, we
may believe, that there is a maximum of this contraction or

expansion, dependent on a certain relative proportion of the dif-
ferent metals. The experiments on the comparative wear of gold, which are
described in the last section, were attended with considerable
difficulties; for this reason, the conclusions have been founded
only upon such facts as were uniformly the same under every
circumstance. These general conclusions have been already
fully stated ; but we may again observe, that gold of moderate
ductility is (all things being considered) the best adapted to the
purpose of coin, and that the real wear of such coin is, in all
probability, very slowly effected; s0 that a long period of time
must elapse, before any considerable diminution in weight can
be perceived. The experiments contained in these three sections were limited
to standard gold; and, allowing that some curious and instruc-
tive facts have been discovered, still more might have been
expected from an extension of such experiments to gold variously
alloyed in every possible proportion: But an immense addition
to metallurgical science would, in all probability, be derived from
a comparative investigation of the whole of the known metallic
substances, formed into binary, ternary, and such like combi-
nations, proceeding from the most simple to the most compli-
cated, and accompanied by accurate observations on the lustre,
colour, ductility, hardness, specific gravity, and fusibility of the
compounds.
