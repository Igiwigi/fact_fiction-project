The case of


EQUATION AND ITS TRANSFORMATIONS. 763

finite solution corresponds in (1) to p = an integer and in Brsser's equation to
y = an integer +4. The fact that BesseL's function J'(z) is exprexsible in a finite
form when y=i+4, and the finite expression itself, are well known, and the case is an
important one in physical investigations ; but, 0 far as I know, the recommencement
of the series after the zero terms has not been specially noticed in connexion with the
subject of BessEL's Functions. The eighth (and last) section contains a list of writings the contents of which are
closely connected with the subject of the memoir, arranged in order of date and classed
under the sections in which they are noticed. There is also in each case a short
account of the portion of the paper for which it has been referred to, with the numbers
of the articles in which the references occur.
