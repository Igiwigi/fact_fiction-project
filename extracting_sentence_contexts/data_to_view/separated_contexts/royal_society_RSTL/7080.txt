& Bay of Benin, under the Equator, and the main current runs straight to the west over
S the Atlantic to Cape Roque, on the east coast of South America. I certainly shall not
Stry to lessen the weight of the arguments which assign the cause of this equatorial
S current to the rotatory motion of the earth, but I will only give some remarks as to
8 other influences that act to the same effect. 1f we compare the quantity of salt which is found in sea-water in the region between

* To compare these observations of specific gravity with the quantity of salt in different depths, which I
haye mentioned in the former part of this paper, I shall here refer to some experiments which T have made to
obtain a ratio by which I could compute the quantity of salts in the sca-water from the specific gravity, and
vice vers&, IT have compared, in thirteen specimens of sea-water, the specific gravity with the quantity of
chlorine which the water contained, between 13%75 C. (56%75 F.) and 18%8 C. (6558 F.).
