may be made with regard to the C’ (ibid., § 43) introduced to explain the Haun
effect. [By {84 above, it is obvious that on the present theory it is impossible to
explain the Haut effect by such a term owing to the results other than the Haut
effect that would ensue from the term. ]

93, Our chief’ conclusions, so far, may he thus summarised :—



THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM. 763

(1.) If P be assumed to be dependent upon ¥, the theory of reversibility suffices to
explain all the known experimental facts of thermoelectricity.

(2.) If, as there is some reason to believe, P be independent of V, the main thermo-
electric effects must be explained on the theory of reversibility, but the Tuomson effect
and the thermoelectric effects observed in a cireuit of a single metal differently stressed
in different parts must be explained on the theory of irreversibility. In this case
there is no such connection between the THomson effect and other thermoelectric effects
as is usually supposed.

(3.) On the present theory it is impossible to explain thermomagnetic phenomena
by the theory of reversibility.

94, There is little to be said with regard to the thermomagnetic phenomena them-
