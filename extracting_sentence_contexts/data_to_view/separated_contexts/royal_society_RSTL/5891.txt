*#For an account of these we refer to M. Tr6cu1/s memoir *. EZ In conclusion, I must briefly allude to the bearing of the facts contained in the present,
Epaper upon the systematic position of the Nympheacee. Notwithstanding that the
Sanatomical character of the roots adds one more Dicotyledonous feature to the character
got these plants, T am more inclined than ever to regard the structure of the rhizome as
Zconforming to the general type of the stem of Monocotyledons rather than to that of
EDicotyledons, among which I have found nothing at all like it. But I do not consider
Athat this character alone can decide the position of the Order, the majority of whose
characters are, on the contrary, clearly Dicotyledonous; it merely brings it into the
position of a link between the two classes, which are by no means 80 markedly separated
from each other as is often supposed from the mode of their arrangement in Systematic
works.
