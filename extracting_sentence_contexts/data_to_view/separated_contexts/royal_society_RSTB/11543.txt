As the antecedent of
this conditional makes clear, it does not undermine CH con-
ditional on prior probabilities that are neutral between CH
and OH. The case against unconscious representations in V4
is conditional on an assumption that is already inconsistent
with CH—the assumption that the neural correlates of visual
consciousness lie somewhere in visual cortex. In fact, CH predicts that later visual areas such as V4 will
process the detailed information that supports performance
in partial report tasks. CH is the hypothesis that cognitive
access to information is what makes the difference between
processing information non-consciously and being conscious
of that information. Apart from a possible role in criterion set-
ting [34], the mechanisms of cognitive access are unsuitable
for the further task of extracting information about distal
stimuli from proximal visual stimulation.
