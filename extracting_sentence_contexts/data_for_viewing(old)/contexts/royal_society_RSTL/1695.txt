entirely distinct from the surrounding glare. I examined this
point with my 90 feet, large 10 feet, common 10 feet, and
also with a 7 feet telescope ; and with every one of these in-
struments I ascertained the reality of its existence.

At the very first sight of it, I judged it to be much smaller
than the little planetary disk in the head of the comet of the
year 1807; but as we are well assured that if any solidity
resembling that of the planets be contained in the comet, it
must be looked for in this bright point; I have called it the
planetary body ; in order to distinguish it from what to the
naked eye or in small telescopes appeared to be a nucleus,
but which in fact was this little body with its surrounding light
or head een together as one object,

With a new 10 feet mirror of extraordinary distinctness, I
examined the bright point every fine evening, and found that
although its contour was certainly not otherwise than round,
I could but very seldom perceive it definedly to be 0.

As hitherto I had only used moderate magnifiers from 100
to 160, because they gave a considerable brightness to the
point, it occurred to me that higher powers might be required
to increase its apparent magnitude ; accordingly the 19th of
October, having prepared magnifiers of 169, 240, goo, 400,
