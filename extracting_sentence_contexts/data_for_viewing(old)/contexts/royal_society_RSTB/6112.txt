no objection to the homology of the crocodile’s concha nasalis with that of the duck
which contains no such diverticulum, for the concha of the lizard and of Calotes
resembles that of the duck in this respect. Instead, the concha in the latter two forms
contains the acini of the lateral nasal gland, and it is interesting to note that acini are
found near the opening of the concha nasalis in the sparrow.

In the mammal, the concha nasalis appears to be represented by a solid structure,
the crista semicircularis (c.s.), behind which the cavity of the nasal capsule extends
sideways and forwards to form the recessus anterior (7.a.), which ends blindly in front,
and thus corresponds to the recessus extraconchalis (r.e.c.) of the lizard and crocodile.
In the bird, if our comparisons are just, there should be no recessus extraconchalis,
for the planum antorbitale presses close up against the hind surface of the concha
nasalis, and there is no room; this, in fact, appears to be so.

Turning now to the structure which we have termed atrio-turbinal in the bird,
it is at any rate clear that it cannot represent the naso-turbinal of the mammal, for
the latter is dorsal and morphologically median to the maxillo-turbinal, whereas the
atrio-turbinal of the bird is lateral to the maxillo-turbinal, fig. 15, B. By exclusion,
therefore, the structure which we have called atrio-turbinal in the bird would seem
to correspond in position to the atrio-turbinal in the mammal, of which rudiments
may perhaps be recognized in the bulges formed by the inner wall of the cavum conche
nasalis, We have no desire, however, to imply a strict and formal homology between
these structures in the bird and mammal, and we have chosen these terms because
of the necessity for avoiding such relative terms as “ anterior,’ or “ middle,” and
because the structures denominated by them seem to represent corresponding elements
