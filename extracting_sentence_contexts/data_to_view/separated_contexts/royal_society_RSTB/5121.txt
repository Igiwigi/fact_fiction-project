The capsular and cranial cavities of Selachians communicate by a
wide fenestra during the embryonic stages, but a complete medial wall of cartilage is
later developed, and only a small foramen remains for the passage of the auditory
nerve (SEWERTZOFF, 1897, 1899). Contrary to the opinion expressed by Kiyprep (1919, p. 16) and others, I conclude
that the conditions found in Amia, Lepidosteus and Teleosts have been derived
phylogenetically from a condition in which a more or less complete wall separated
the cranial cavity from that of the capsule. The reduction of this wall appears to
have been brought about by the inward expansion of the membranous labyrinth,
and the fact that in bony fishes this expansion takes place at a comparatively
early stage would account for the non-appearance of a medial cartilaginous wall
at any period of the ontogeny.§ The general narrowing of the cranium in bony
fishes may have been a second factor with which the reduction of the inner wall is
correlated. The cartilaginous semicircular septa, varying from one to three in number, are present
in all bony fishes.|| The lateral septum always occupies a vertical position, but the
anterior and posterior septa may be either horizontal or oblique.
