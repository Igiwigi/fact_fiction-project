DR, DAUBENY ON THE ROTATION OF CROPS, ETC. 209

It appears then that out of the whole series, there are only four cases in which the
ayerage amount of the permanent crop was equal or superior to that of the shifting
one.

In the first of these, the Tobacco, the fact may be accounted for, from the condition
of the ground being more favourable to the permanent than to the shifting crop on
the year of its introduction, the former being obtained from soil which had been re-
cently manured, the latter from what had been partially exhausted by preceding crops.

The second, the Beet, was scarcely continued for a sufficient length of time to lead
to any certain conclusions.

The two others, namely, the Endive and Mint, present results 80 nearly agreeing
in the amount of their permanent and shifting crops, that the slight disparity may be
fairly referred to contingent circumstances, and an nniformity in the products obtained
may in consequence be inferred.
