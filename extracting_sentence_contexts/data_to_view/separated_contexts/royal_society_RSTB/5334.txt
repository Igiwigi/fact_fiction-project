3. The Life-history of Plasmodiophora brassicae. The general life-history of P. brassice has been described by various authors, and for
the most part they are in agreement as to the essential facts. The life-history may
conveniently be divided into three stages : (a) the infection of the host by the parasite,
(6) the growth of the organism at the expense of the host, and the resultant hypertrophy
of the invaded tissues, (¢) the multiplication of the fungus by the production of masses
of spores within the diseased cells. (a) The growth of the fungus within the host tissues.—If an examination be made from
sections cut from a very young diseased root, numerous uninucleated bodies will be
found lying in the cortical tissues.
