hand, both the type with coalescent sporangia, and that with separate sporangia
associated in a sorus, are very ancient, and have been recognised as having existed
already in Marattiaceous ferns from the lower Coal Measures. In arriving at these

conclusions I do not ignore the possibility that ferns interesting for comparison, or
even of truly Marattiaceous character, may have existed earlier. I would on the
contrary suppose that very important links in the chain of evolution existed before
those taken by Srur as the basis of his argument. It is true that Senftenbergia
is recorded from earlier rocks than well authenticated Marattiaces: ; but its affinities
seem to be with the Schizeacez rather than the Marattiacesw. In the fact that it is
perhaps the earliest recorded fern in which the details of the sporangia are well
enough preserved to form a basis for comparison, I see no sufficient reason for
regarding it as a Marattiaceous ancestor, or even as representing a condition ever
passed through in the evolution of the Marattiacese. Moreover, it. is not the
earliest known fern; those of the Devonian period have also to be remembered,
while in the Culm there is evidence of a considerable and varied fern flora: this has
been brought into prominence afresh by Sotms-Laupacu’s recent revision of the
fossil plants described by Uncrr from the Unter-Culm (‘ Abhandl. d. k. Pr. Geol.
Landesanstalt,’ Neue Folge, part 23). The variety of structure of fern petioles there
described is considerable ; it is reasonable to suppose that this variety of vegetative
structure was accompanied by variety of the sorus, and it should at least be a
warning against generalisation in such a case as this from few facts. It is quite
