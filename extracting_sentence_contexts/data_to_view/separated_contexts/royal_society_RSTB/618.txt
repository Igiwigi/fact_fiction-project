I have noticed
it twice. It is looked upon by BRown-Skquarp and his followers as a proof of the
sensory decussation in the cord, especially when taken in conjunction with the fact
that they state that there is anesthesia in the opposite side of the body behind the
lesion. Lupwic and WoroscuiLorr and Martinorrr explain the hypereesthesia by
the removal of influence of certain inhibitory fibres ; but Ferrer statest that the
hyperesthesia on the side of lesion is only a sign by contrast of the diminished
sensibility on the other side, and as a matter of fact ceases when the other lateral
column is similarly divided, and both legs are reduced to the same level of sensibility. This, however, is not strictly true, because Martinorri made a bilateral injury of a
