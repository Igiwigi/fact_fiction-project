If softness is to be judged by the B-H curve
it is clear that the early portion of the curve is the best guide. In a paper read before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers* on the
“Law of Hysteresis,” Mr. C. P. Srermmertz has discussed certain experiments on
the relation of |H dI to B, and contends that the empirical formula

[H di = yb",

where 7 is a constant factor, is in good agreement with the results of experiment. From the figures Mr. Sremmerz gives, and from those which our own experiments
supply, it appears that within a certain range of values of B this formula may be
taken as giving a fairly close approximation to the real value of JH dI. As an
empirical formula of the kind is of use to designers of transformers, we have been
at some pains to examine how nearly and within what range a formula of this
type may be taken to represent the facts. It will suffice to refer to one example in
some detail. Taking Ring IV.
