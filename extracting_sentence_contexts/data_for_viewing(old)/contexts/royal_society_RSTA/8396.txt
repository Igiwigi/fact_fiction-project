be accounted for by the possible combined errors of all the operations entering into the
two independent determinations. The new determination, therefore, does not appear
to suggest evidence of any actual change in the lengths of the primary standards of
either the Yard or Metre during the last 30 years.]

THE CALIBRATION OF THE SPANS OF Nr 184.

Section I.—Notes on Calibration of Scales.
A. Notation. ,

1. m,n, p, q, ete., are integral numbers representing the theoretical distances of certain
graduations from the zero of the scale in appropriate units. They are, in fact, the labels
of these graduations.

2. m/n means the actual distance between the graduations marked m and n. For
convenience m is taken as the smaller number of the pair.

3. ,(m/n), means the distance m/n in terms of the distance p/q as correct, i.¢.,

n—m
A(m/n), = m/n — eres

/4.
This quantity will naturally be expressed in much smaller units than m/n or p/q.
