reversing, and its effect is due to the difference between two opposing forces, whereas,
when measured directly it is due to a force in one direction only. It will be seen from
the figures that a smaller value of the helix effect is in fact required to bring the corrected
values of 0, to equality. There is no error arising from this cause, however, when all
four values of 9, are taken into account. The signs of m are connected with those of 4, (corrected for helix) by the rule that
a -+ sign before 6, means a rotation of the specimen in an anti-clockwise direction
when seen from above.
