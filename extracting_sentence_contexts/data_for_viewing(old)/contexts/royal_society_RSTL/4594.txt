electricities developed in the prism : according to this relation, verified by experiment,
if we represent (as Amezrs did for electro-magnetic action) the nervous current
by the figure of a man extended on the nerve and looking towards the tail of the
torpedo, or the dorsal surface of the gymnotus, the positive electricity of the prism

is found invariably to the left of the man. We may account for the position of the
poles at the extremities of each prism, and the intensity of the discharge being pro-
portionate with the length of the prisms, by the fact that each prism of the organ is
a temporary electrical apparatus, as has been proved by numerous experiments.

3. It is proved by experiments that the strictest analogy exists between the dis-
charge of electrical fishes and muscular contraction ; there is not a circumstance
which modifies one of these phenomena without acting equally on the other.

4. The contraction of a muscle developes in the nerve with which it is in contact,
the cause by means of which the nerve excites contractions in the muscle through
which it is ramified. Although it has not been possible as yet to decide by experi-
ment whether this phenomenon ought to be considered as a case of nervous induction,
or as the proof of an electric discharge produced by muscular contraction, we are
compelled by analogy to adopt the latter hypothesis.
