The convergence of the semigroup S in the above example can, of course, also be shown by
simpler methods than Corollary 3.7 or Theorem 3.8—for instance, by employing the spectral
theorem for self-adjoint operators. Yet, we chose to include this simple example since it gives
a nice contrast to Example 6.1 and since it is a good illustration of the use of irreducibility (to
conclude that there are no eigenvalues in (0, 00)).

7. Eventual positivity

While positivity of semigroups is a ubiquitous phenomenon in analysis, it might come as a
surprise at first glance that some evolution equations exhibit only eventually positive rather than
positive behaviour. We say that a semigroup S on our Banach lattice E is eventually positive if there
exists a time fo > 0 such that S(t) > 0 for all t > to; this does not assume (nor does it imply) that
S(t) is positive for small times. In fact, the property that we just described should more precisely
be called uniform eventual positivity, since there exists a single time from which on all operators
are positive—in contrast to the situation where the single orbits become eventually positive for
positive initial value, but where the time when this happens depends on the initial value (see
[50, Example 5.7] for an example which shows that this can indeed occur).
Here is a simple criterion for eventual positivity of self-adjoint semigroups.

Theorem 7.1. Let S be a self-adjoint Co-semigroup on L? :=L?(@,) for a o-finite measure space
(2, 4). Assume that there exists a quasi-interior point u in L? with the following two properties:

(1) There exists a time to such that, for each f €L?, the modulus |S(to)f| is dominated by an
(f-dependent) multiple of u.
