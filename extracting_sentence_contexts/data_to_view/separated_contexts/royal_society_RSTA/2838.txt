If these solitary branches bifurcated
from Fin, then they would be shown to originate from F=1lin figure 6. However, this is not the
case and the authors believe this is due to numerical errors introduced by truncation or a grid that
is too coarse. These numerical difficulties are related to the fact that the solitary waves become
more and more oscillatory and less localized as the bifurcation points are approached. Similar
difficulties have been encountered previously for gravity—capillary waves (e.g. [42]). Figure 6 (taken together with figures 7-10) shows that solitary waves in finite depth have
a smaller free surface slope than those for infinite depth for a similar distance (in F) from the
