320 A. HUNTER ON THE SPECTRA OF SINGLY AND DOUBLY

The true separations of these “D terms are, however, 81-08 and 48-06 respectively,
as may be seen from the well-established multiplets 4p 4P —4d4D at 24300 and
4p 4D us 4d 4D at 24000. Moreover, in addition to the fact that the intensity dis-
tribution in the multiplet is irregular, the lines vv 22171-7, 22123-1 have been satis-
factorily classified elsewhere (see Table Il), so that the proposed classifications for
these must be rejected. The identification of v 22254-1 with 4p 4S). — 4d 4D5/9
has been retained since the agreement between its calculated and observed positions
is within 0-1 cm.1.
