We recorded the ambient
air temperature and pressure at the observer's position using a

to the incident side wind [14]. However, this predicted adjust-
ment of airspeed according to side winds, more specifically to
the angle between track and heading, has to the best of our
knowledge never been observed in birds thus far. Possibly,
this depends on the fact that the birds in studies where this pre-

dicted effect was tested for failed to compensate for wind drift pocket weather meter (Kestrel 4500NV), and updated data regu-
and therefore exhibited partial drift, thus not fulfilling the larly during a session. Following the completion of each run,

achieve full compensation for wind drift, and did adjust air- haviour (straight, meandering, circling and feeding) and flock
speed with respect to the side-wind component (wind size were recorded.
