associated with a period of 106°5 weeks, though there is also apparently during the
last 25 years a subsidiary period of approximately 102 weeks. The Glasgow
statistics deserve a more complete investigation than they have hitherto received,
but even with the present information they afford quite sufficient evidence to show
that the exact two-yearly period shown to exist in a number of places has no
essential connection with the solar year. For longer periods it is to be noted that in
Aberdeen between 1856 and 1885 the epidemics of measles occurred at intervals of
143 weeks. This is the longest undoubted period discovered, nor on investigation
has any subsidiary period of importance been found to exist. The amplitude of this
period exceeds 800. The existence of this periodicity in Aberdeen for 30 years
demonstrates the probability that some of the long periods found by the present
method to exist in London prior to the introduction of registration may represent
concrete facts. In this connection the period of 146 weeks found to be the main
period in the first epoch must be mentioned. With regard to Dundee, I considered
in my previous papers that for the first 20 years of registration the intervals between
the epidemics should be considered as three years. This opinion I still hold, As
the point is important, the figures are reprinted (Table V).
