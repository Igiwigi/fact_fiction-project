it is universal, and that in such analyses as are found not to
accord with this general observation, we are warranted in
suspecting, Some degree of inaccuracy in one or other of the
results compared together. _

According to Mr. DALTON's theory, by which these facts
are best explained, chemical union in the state of neutraliza-
tion takes place between single atoms of the substances com-
bined; and in cases where there is a redundance of either
ingredient, then two or more atoms of this kind are united to
only one of the other.

According to. this view, when we estimate the relative
weights of equivalents, Mr. DaLTon conceives that we are
estimating the aggregate weights of a given number of atoms,
and consequently the proportion which the ultimate single
atoms: bear to each other. But since it is impossible in several
instances, where only two combinations of the. same ingre-
