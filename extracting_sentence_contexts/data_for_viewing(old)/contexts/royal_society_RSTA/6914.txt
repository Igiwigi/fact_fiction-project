by a phase change.

Suppose the upgoing wave to be polarized with its electric field in the vertical plane, and
observations to be made on this same component of field in the downcoming wave. The

appropriate reflexion coeflicient is the one which we have called #,,, and we shall write
¢ —argR,,. If ¢ is independent of the angle 0, we may describe the experimental results
in terms of a fictitious horizonal reflector. If, however, ¢ depends on @, we must explain the
results in terms either of a reflector whose height, or whose phase-shift, depends on 0.
Equation (10-3) gives the relative phase of the reflected vertical component of the field;

for brevity denote arg E, by y. Then
x = ¢—2kz, cos @—k( —zcos 6+ «sin 6),

omitting the Act. Taking the transmitter at the origin, and measuring the phase of the
reflected wave at the ground where z = 0, then

X = x(x, 8) = ¢—2kz, cos 0 —kxsin 0. (11-1)

As shown by Hartree (1931), the emitted wave may be resolved into trains of plane waves
