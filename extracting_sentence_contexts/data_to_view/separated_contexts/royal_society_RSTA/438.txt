i.e. when
i<r+1+y-+2y’ and this will hold over the whole range of integration when ¢<r+1+y and
y,.; will then be zero, i.e. equation (64) will hold for r+ 1 if it holds for r. Since by equation
(68) it holds for r = 1 it follows by induction that it is true for all r. Thus the successive terms in our solution as given by equation (28) each start their
contribution at unit time after the preceding term and since in our choice of units this unit
time is the time taken for a sound pulse to travel the width of the strip, our solution corre-
sponds, as it should do, to a series of diffraction waves starting from each edge, a wave from
any one edge starting a further wave when it reaches the farther edge and so on. Moreover, we note that by virtue of equation (64) that the solution obtained by stopping

at any term y, in equation (55) is in fact the exact solution for ¢<r+1+y. Conversely for

any finite time our solution consists only ofa finite number of terms corresponding physically
to a finite number of ‘reflexions’ of the original diffraction wave from each edge. We may
also note that by virtue of equation (64) the range of integration in equation (61) is in fact
finite.

Equations (55), (62) and (61) thus give an explicit formal solution for y(y,t) which is
the distribution of —dp/dn on AB in figure 1 and by symmetry this gives also the distribution
on CD in figure 1, whilst on BC we have y = 0 by virtue of the boundary condition.
