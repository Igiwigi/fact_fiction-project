For
example, in the case of crystal A, the cube axes, xyz, of the kamacite are related to the
axes, XYZ, of the octahedrite by means of the matrix, (b), given below:

X 14 Z
x +0076 -+0-758  —0-648
y +0148 +0634 +0-759 (6)
z +0986  —0154  —0-064

It is then found that the (011)-plane of crystal A is inclined at an angle of 1°-5 to the
(11T)-plane of the octahedrite. Thus crystal A belongs to the family of kamacite crystals
which have formed on Widmanstatten plane 1, a fact which agreed with visual observa-
tion of the crystal on the plane of section, PQ. Some 21 kamacite crystals were examined in this manner. Of these 15 were found to
satisfy the test that a {110}-plane of the kamacite was nearly parallel to a {111}-plane of
the octahedrite.
