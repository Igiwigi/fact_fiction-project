The sinuosities of the upturned palate
(fig. 4), its plaits and its crevices, are easily understood by reference to the diagram
(fig. 5). PFirst Preoral Arch.—The trabecular rods form together an elegantly lyriform struc-
ture; they already have begun their extensive © commissure,” being parallel now in
their fore half. Behind, they are like callipers, and the blades are at some distance from
each other; their apices, sharpened off, seem to approach the fore end of the investing
mass (#.v.) ; but a sectional view (fig. 6, tr.cm., 7.v.) corrects this error, and shows that these
diverse parts lie on a totally distinct plane and far from each other, a fact I pointed out
long ago in my paper on the Frog (Phil. Trans. 1871, Plate 111. p. 143). These trabe-
cular blades embrace the pituitary body ( py.); but their curve does not conform to
its shape, and is altogether independent of it, being the proper © habit ” or morpholo-
gical fashion of the arch.
