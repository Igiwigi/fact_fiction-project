We see that
the maximum error of the mean formula is under 2 per cent., and the average error
under 1 per cent. These errors appear to me less than the personal equation of two
observers, measuring the same series of skulls. In fact, I am inclined to think that
the errors of the mean formule may be as much due to the different observers
who have determined the “actual” values as to defects in the formule them-
selves. The close association of the Aino and German results is specially note-

‘. worthy. S The results for the correlation and regression, not only of the skull, but of the
S long bones of the Ainos, show a relation much closer to modern Europeans (French
5 and German) than the latter bear to the Naqadas.
