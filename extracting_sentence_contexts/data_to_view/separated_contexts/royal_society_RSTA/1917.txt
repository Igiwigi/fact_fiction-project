The principle that the lines of movement and the structures in newer rocks often
follow (“posthumously”) lines and structures existing in underlying rocks as the
result of earlier movement is well known, and has been applied with success in
many cases even though definite exceptions are known. If, now, we review the
evidence that favours the application of this principle to the area now under
consideration we obtain many clear indications that the post-Triassie movements
followed the lines of earlier pre-Permian movements. There is firstly the evidence
of the faults with a small throw in the Triassic rocks, and a much greater throw in
the underlying Carboniferous rocks, Secondly, there is the fact that where the
Paleozoic rocks in the concealed coalfield are twisted round to the south-east, the
overlying Mesozoic rocks also suffer a local south-eastward twist, but to a lesser
degree than in the case of the older rocks below. There is then a definite
