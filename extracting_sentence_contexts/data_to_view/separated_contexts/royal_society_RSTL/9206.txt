A narrow ring of tinfoil round the tube will give all the results above dexcribed. Again, if-a coil of insulated wire be placed near or round the tube, no difference is
oduced by joining the ends of the wire. In fact, no difference of effect is observable
Shether the conductor be made up of insulated wire or be a mere mass of metal ; the
hole seems to owe its effect to its being a conductor of considerable size. No form
&f conductor possesses greater effect than a narrow ring of tinfoil connected to earth
by a single fine copper wire perpendicular to the tube, and no conducting system could
be devised more unfavourable to the production of electro-magnetic inductive currents
by the original current in the tube. Moreover, the effect is far too great to be
attributable to electro-magnetic induction in circuits s0 unfavourable to its action.
