The moxst striking particulars in the last line of these Tables are the following :

elements. And this remarkable agreement proves that the Irregularities as meagured
here are real objective facts. For they are measured from photographic sheets in which
the scales are very different: on the Westerly and Northerly records, 0:01 of Horizontal
Force is represented by 287 inches "and 2:55 inches, while on the Nadir record 0-01 of
Horizontal Force is represented by 0-88 inch. Yet the eye of the Reader of the Photo-
graphs has caught the Irregularities when shown on this s8mall scale as certainly as
when shown on the larger scale.
