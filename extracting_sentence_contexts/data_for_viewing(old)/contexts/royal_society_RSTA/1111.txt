Given that we have the coupling functions, we can ask what they tell us about the behaviour
of the pair of oscillators. Let ¢ = 2 — 1. Then
do
qr 7 P2(-¢) — Mi(@) = C(#).

Zeros of C(), ¢9 correspond to phase-locked solutions to the coupled system and if C’(¢o) < 0
(respectively, > 0), the locked solution is stable (unstable). If the oscillators are identical, i.e. H) =
H2 =H, then C(¢) is proportional to the odd part of H(@) and so there are always the roots, ¢ = 0,
synchrony, and ¢ = T/2, anti-phase (There can, of course, be other roots as well, but they will
always occur symmetrically in pairs due to the fact that C(#) is an odd function).

(b) Example

As an example of what determines the shape of the coupling functions, we consider the behaviour
of the Morris—Lecar model in two different scenarios. We choose parameters (as in table 3.1 in [11])
to be near the saddle-node infinite cycle (SNIC) bifurcation with applied current Iapp = 45 or near
the sub-critical Hopf bifurcation with Tapp = 92. The currents are chosen so that the oscillators
in each case have a frequency of about 10 Hz. Coupling is via synapses as in equation (1.4). We
choose excitatory (E = 0 mV) or inhibitory (E = —75 mV) coupling. The synaptic variables satisfy

ds _s 1
dt = t (1+exp(—(V — 20)/3))’
