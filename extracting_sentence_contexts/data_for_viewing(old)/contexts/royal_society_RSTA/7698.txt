this statement having some intelligible justification on the ground of the theory of
probability. ; ;

This point requires to be made more precise. Following the routine of thought
established under the influence of the Bayes Theorem, we could ask that, given the

P{9 (E’) < 0,° < 6 (E’)|E} =«,

we see at once that it contradicts the assumption that 6,° is constant. In fact, on
this assumption, whatever the fixed point E’ and the values 0 (E’) and 0 (E’), the
only values the probability (19) may possess are zero and unity. For this reason we
shall drop the specification of the problem as given by the condition (19).

Returning to the inequalities (18), we notice that while the central part, 0,°, is a
constant, the extreme parts 0 (E’) and 6 (E’) are particular values of random
variables. In fact, the coordinates of the sample point E are the random variables
(4), and if @ (E) and 6 (E) are single-valued functions of E, they must be random
variables themselves.

Therefore, whenever the functions @ (E) and 6 (E) are defined in one way or
another, but the sample point E is not yet fixed by observation, we may legitimately
