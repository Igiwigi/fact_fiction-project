CHYLAQUEOUS FLUID OF INVERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 645

In every Mollusk* yet examined the blood has been found to be colourless, not
colourless like distilled water, but like very dilute milk. It is more coagulable than
any variety of chylaqueous fluid; and from its viscidity it is undoubtedly more
highly charged with the fibrinous principle than the latter. This fact results neces-
sarily from the circumstance, that it constitates in itself the entire fluid element of
nutrition in the Mollusks, and that it is the eat of direct corpuscular agency. In
this series the blood is invariably corpusculated. The proportion of the floating cells
to the fluid varies however in different orders.
