could be used as the basis of a representation of the low-temperature curves at y = 20° in
figure 12; here ais positive, 0, as in (10), stands for 27E,/fH and ¢ is for the moment arbitrary.
To obtain a still closer representation, the amplitudes of the three periodic terms in (12)
were varied in accordance with the appropriate values of the relevant parameters; it
was found that to avoid too rapid decay of the four-thirds frequency term the parameter x
had to be taken as 0-3° K, a value much lower than the 1-5° K found for the main frequency.*
The final result is shown in figure 12, and it can be seen that it does give a fair representation

* The calculation of the modulation was in fact somewhat simplified by assuming that the amplitudes
of the successive terms in (12) fell linearly from their initial values at 1/H = 0-65 x 10~ to final values at
about 1/H = 1:3 x 10-* of 0-72, 0-72 and 0-32 of the initial values. The use of a linear rather than exponential
interpolation is not likely to cause any serious distortion.

of the experimental curves. It is quite likely that a still better fit might be obtained by con-
sidering higher harmonics and harmonics of the four-thirds frequency, but the data are
hardly accurate enough (not consistent enough between G 1 and G 4) to make this profitable.
