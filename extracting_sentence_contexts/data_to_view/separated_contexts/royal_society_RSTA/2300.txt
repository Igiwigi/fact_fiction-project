This is shown repeatedly in the well-
known researches by Prof. C. V. Boys$ and Prof. J. H. Poynttne.|| The necessity of
providing a steady temperature about the delicate parts of the apparatus has hitherto
been considered an insuperable bar to any direct experiment to discover a temperature
effect for G. In fact, in 1905, shortly before the present research began, the late
Prof. Poyntine and Mr. P. Puriires! wrote as follows :—“ The difficulties of exact
determination (of the Newtonian constant) at ordinary temperatures are not yet
overcome and at very high or low temperatures they would be so much increased
that the research seems at present hopeless.”
