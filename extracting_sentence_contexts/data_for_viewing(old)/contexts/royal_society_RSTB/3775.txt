P. polytes, though, as has been pointed out by Prof. Ponnerr,* considerable
variation is found in the colour and extent of the subterminal series of spots on the
underside of the hind wing. The cyius 2 shows a similar variation, though its
range is somewhat different, for the normal female coincides with those males which
have the subterminal spots most developed and most highly coloured ; variations from
the normal in the female usually tend towards an accentuation of these features, and
thus pass further from the normal type of male. As a whole, the material obtained
seems to show that the variation is truly continuous, passing from a male with the
spots barely discernible to a female in which they are much accentuated and are
marked almost as strongly on the upper surface of the wing as on the lower. Efforts
were made to trace some connection between this variation and the polymorphism of
the female sex, but without success. Some such connection may exist, but as no
suggestion whatever can be made on the subject, the mere statement of these facts is
deemed sufficient.

As, externally, there is only one form of male, it becomes evident that the eyrus ?
and the male must differ in constitution ; further, as each form of female can give
three distinct results, it is probable that there are at least three forms of male, two of
which correspond to the mimetic females, though externally they resemble the other
