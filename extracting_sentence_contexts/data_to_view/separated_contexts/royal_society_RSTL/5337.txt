The volume of liquid in this osmometer
s20n begins to increase and is observed to rise in the tube, while the simultaneous
appearance of salt in the water of the jar may easily be verified. M. DuTrocuer de-
scribed the result as the movement of two unequal streams through the membrane
in opposite directions, the smaller stream being that of the saline solution flowing
outwards, and the larger that of pure water flowing inwards. The double current
has been always puzzling, but the expression of the fact becomes more conceivable
when we say (as we may do truly) that the molecules of the salt travel outwards by
diffusion through the porous membrane. It is not the whole saline liquid which
moves outwards, but merely the molecules of salt, their water of solution being
passive. The inward current of water, on the other hand, appears to be a true sensible
stream or a current carrying masses.
