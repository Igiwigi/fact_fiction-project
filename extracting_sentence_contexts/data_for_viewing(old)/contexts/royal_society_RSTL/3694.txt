not after ignition yield traces of alkali, yet it is never present in such quantity as could
give the above results, when thefreshly precipitated substance has been properly washed.

The properties of the suboxide of palladium, now first definitely found, are not
very distinct. The existence of this snuboxide had been long suspected, especially
from the fact, that by heating to dull redness in contact with air, metallic palladium
becomes coloured blue or green on the surface, which colours are removed by violent
ignition. Bxgrzeivs found, however, that this colouring was not attended with any
increase of weight, which arises, however, from the minute quantity of oxide formed,
the colours being those of thin plates ; but there can be now no doubt but that for-
mation of snboxide does 80 occur. That the black powder which is left by the dull
ignition of the basic carbonate is really a definite compound, is strongly supported
by the fact of the accuracy with which the decomposition stops at its formation, and
by the analogy of the subchloride, to be hereafter described, it gains additional force.
Yet I have not been able to combine in any way this suboxide with acids. By con-
tact with them, it gives an ordinary salt of the protoxide and metal. It is possible,
however, that in future trials I may be more successful.

It is known that by the addition of a caustic fixed alkali to a salt of palladium a
precipitate is obtained, which redissolves in a great excess of the alkali. The preci-
pitate is in this case a basic salt, not the hydrated oxide, and always contains traces
of the alkali, from which it is with difficulty freed by washing. The soJuble alkaline
compound cannot be obtained in a definite form by any process that I have as yet,
tried. By evaporation to dryness, the oxide Separates anhydrous, and retaining a
small quantity of alkali.
