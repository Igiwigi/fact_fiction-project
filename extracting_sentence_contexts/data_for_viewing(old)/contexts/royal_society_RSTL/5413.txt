In like manner [p, 2] =[p, [q, Zz]].

Thus the expression given above for | p, q] becomes

Cp, 9'=[p, [s Z)]+[4, [2 27] ]+[2, [p, 9]

which is identically equal to 0, by the theorem (30.). Consequently, for any two
integrals p and 9,
> 0 Role + ey (83)

This theorem, as has been already mentioned, was discovered, in the case of the
dynamical equations, by Porsson ; and the fact that he was able to arrive at it
through s0 long and complex a process as that which he has given in his first memoir
on the Variation of Arbitrary Constants*, must be looked upon as a remarkable
instance of his analytical skill. T am not acquainted with any attempt to simplify
the demonstration, except that of Sir W. HamwroxÞ ; in fact it is probable that no
material simplification was attainable without the help of the transformation of the
differential equations to the form (I.), towards which Porss0N (as Jacost has remarked)
only made a first step. Sir W. Hamrox's demonstration may certainly be con-
sidered simple as compared with that of Porssox. That which I have given above
will, I hope, be regarded as a further improvement.
