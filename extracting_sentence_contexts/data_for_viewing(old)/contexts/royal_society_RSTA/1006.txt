In addition, in the two ferrogels, in the absence of a field, as the strain increases up to y_ * 300%
the elastic response is progressively larger. This behaviour is not usual in elastic solids because, in
the VLR, G’ is practically constant. Nevertheless, we have to bear in mind that the microstructure
of these gels is a network in which the knots are occupied by magnetic particles linked to the
polymer chains. In consequence, at very low strain a part of the net will be relaxed (lower G’) and
then, as the network is progressively stretched more and more branches withstand the mechanical
stress. This fact, at the macroscopic scale, implies a progressive increase in G’. Obviously, when
the maximum stretching is exceeded the break point is reached.

On the other hand, when an external field was applied, the magnetic particles located in
the knots of the net were brought closer and the elastic modulus should increase, leading to
a significant MR effect in the ferrogels. This effect is evident for low enough strain values,
approximately for yo <1 (100%). Nevertheless, as the network was stretched the magnetic
particles were compelled to separate and the dipole-dipole magnetic force decayed, and the MR
effect was progressively lower. Finally, as the critical strain was approached (as occurred in the
absence of field), the mechanical response of the gels depended only on the network deformation.
For this reason, all the curves independently of the field applied collapsed at a relatively large
strain (300%).
