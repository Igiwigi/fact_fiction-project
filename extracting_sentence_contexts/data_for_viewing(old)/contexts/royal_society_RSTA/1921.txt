«|,-_q@ tanhk (D — d) =iv tanh (acts (5) - u), (3.3e)

More details on the derivation of this expression are given in the forthcoming companion paper
by Webber & Huppert [11]. Considering the case of no porous layer (d > D), we recover the
familiar dispersion relation w? = gk tanhkD first derived by Airy (see Craik [18]) and reproduced
in equation (14) of Stokes [1].

Note here that the constants’ values depend solely on the value of the permeability at the
interface between the porous medium and the fluid overlying it, and not on any values of
permeability within the porous layer. This can be interpreted as the fact that the flow above the
porous layer is not at all affected by the permeability profile of the porous layer underlying it in
this model. This is an effect which arises from the independence of any of the matching conditions
on velocity derivatives, as we match only pressures and not stresses at the interface.

(b) Stokes drift velocities above the reef

With the above velocity fields in mind, we see that the velocity field above the reef is of an identical
form to that for a fluid layer with no porous bed, as detailed by Stokes [1], albeit with different
values of constants. Therefore, the Stokes drift velocities can be easily found. Using the result of
equation (1.3), where the brackets (---) denote time-averaging over a period T = 27/w of wave
motion,
