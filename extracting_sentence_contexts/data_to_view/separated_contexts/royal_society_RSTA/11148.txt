Priatinum Wire. The effect of the electric discharge from a pointed wire in altering the appearance
of a steam-jet has been studied by many observers. Tn expansion experiments, however, no effect appears to have been noticed other
than the immediate removal of all dust particles or fog from the air inside the
apparatus.* To study the properties of the condensation nuclei arising from this

_iouree an expansion apparatus allowing of rapid expansions of large amount is, in
fact, “necessary.

& The apparatus which I have used for experiments on this subject is shown in
Bfig. 12. The cloud-vessel consisted of a glass bulb with a side tube through which
Swas sealed a platinum wire, reaching well into the interior of the bulb and ending in
a sharp point. This was connected to one terminal of a Wimshurst machine.
