In any case, either statement
might be correct, since the amount transferred depends also upon the area through
which the transference takes place, which is not given. If diffusion is slow, then the wood-parenchyma cells would hardly be capable of so
rapid a transference of dissolved material as is required by the foregoing theory. As
a matter of fact, diffusion in small plant cells is not slow, but extremely rapid. Suppose a broad tube, a metre long, to be half filled with a strong solution of copper
sulphate, and then filled up with water without mixing, it would take more than 10
years before a cubic centimetre at any point of the tube contained approximately the
same amount of copper sulphate. The time required is, however, proportional to the
square of the length of the tube, so that if the latter were 1 centim.
