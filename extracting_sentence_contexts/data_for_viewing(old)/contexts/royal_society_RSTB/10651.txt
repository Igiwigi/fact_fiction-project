through ecological restoration or aquaculture, might protect
people from the risk of contracting schistosomiasis and could
complement drug-distribution programmes [58].

5. Discussion and Conclusion

While poverty, infectious disease, and environmental change
have been the subject of much independent investigation,
they are interlinked in complex ways that require integrated
study in order to meet key targets in the Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals [9]. Poverty and weak health systems arguably
pose the most important risk factors for acquiring and
succumbing to infectious diseases. Less recognized is the fact
that pathogens and parasites responsible for most tropical
diseases of poverty are predominantly transmitted through
environmental pathways and highly influenced by ecological
factors. Here, we describe a simple framework for studying
the complex relationships between poverty, infectious diseases,
and the environment. The aim of this framework is to help
investigate environmental drivers of joint povertyâ€”disease
dynamics, with the ultimate goal of identifying sustainable
solutions for human and planetary health. Preliminary ana-
lyses illustrate the limited effectiveness of human drug
treatment for the control of ETDs, when compared with
directly transmitted diseases. Although the model cannot be
