on the 1st and 2nd branchial arches, which are thus seen to be developments of the
cutaneous system. If the skin be now peeled away from the rest of the cheek (fig. 3),
we $hall see what caused the ribbings in the mouth-cavity (fig. 4); here are displayed a
scries of parallel subvertical rods of rapidly hardening cartilage, which occupy the whole
space from the middle of the fronto-nasal process to the thoracic yelk-mass. Here we
se that the swollen condition of the cheeks seen in the front view (fig. 1) is not 80 much
due to the size of the oral © chasm,” as to the very 80lid walls of the face ; nearly all the
tissue intervening between the oral lining and the outer skin has been expended in the
formation of these bars, which are very closely packed together externally. It will be
8een, both from the inner and outer view (figs. 4 & 3), that the shape of these bars is
gently sigmoid, that they bulge outwards in their middle part, that they turn inwards
both above and below, and that the foremost and the last two or three do not reach 80
far downwards as those in the middle. This arises from the fact that the foremost pair
lie above and in front of the mouth, and the hinder arches lie above the pericardium.
They thus follow the shape of the © stomo-pharyngeal cavity,” of which they are
the skeleton ; and they are by no means to be confounded with the arches that grow
from the segmented yertebral axis, which, when finished afterwards, enclose the heart
and all the other viscera. The point, firs of all in importance, which is to be noted
here is that these rods are all absolutely distinct (fig. 3); their upper termination
