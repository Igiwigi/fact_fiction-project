53. It will be seen that, though the sutures of the underbasals still persist, the
2 plates themselves have grown out into five angles. These angles are radial in position,
| EB fitting in between the bases of the basal plates; and, while the underbasal of the
2 radius A produces only one angle, each of the other two grows out into two angles:
3 this fact strongly suggests that each of these larger underbasals represents a pair of
3 coalesced plates, and that the primitive arrangement would be the possession of five
& radial underbasals. At a slightly later stage the sutures disappear, though the groove
Ã© separating the underbasal series from the top stem-joint persists for some time. The
z whole large plate thus formed has always been regarded hitherto as a simple centro-

dorsal, whereas, in reality, the top stem-joint, forming only the lower half of this
large plate, is the true centrodorsal.
