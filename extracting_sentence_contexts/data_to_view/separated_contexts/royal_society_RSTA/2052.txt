Other equations could be obtained in like manner, but the equations here given will
be sufficient to determine the functions which occur in E,. In fact, for the particular
application which we wish to make of Hg, it will only be necessary to determine Q, (C*)

and Q, (C*). We assume that the latter functions can be expressed as power series in
C. No attempt will be made to establish any convergency conditions necessary in
the course of the analysis, but the subsequent numerical calculations indicate that the
series are rapidly convergent.
