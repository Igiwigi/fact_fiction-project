We found the intensity of infection was significantly
greater in the metamorphs of A. obstetricans than either
B. spinosus or R. temporaria in all years (electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S1a), and year was a significant predictor of
infection intensity in all three species (electronic supplemen-
tary material). It is possible that an increase in infection load
in the highly parasitized Alytes could contribute to the changes
in prevalence seen in the other two species, but we found no
significant association between Alytes infection load and the
prevalence of infection in either B. spinosus or R. temporaria
(p = 0.68; 0.88, respectively).

The fact that a species previously resistant to infection
and disease alters in different environmental/climatic con-
texts illustrates the importance of understanding
community-level dynamics when considering the impacts
of infections. Our data show that a species thought to be
highly resistant to infection and disease can suffer mortality
(figure 2a); prior to the current study, R. temporaria had
rarely been found to be infected with Bd [14] and had
never been observed to suffer chytridiomycosis despite wide-
spread surveillance across Europe. However, we detected
widespread infection in this species, along with mortality
due to chytridiomycosis (figure 2a), when spring onset was
early. We also found concurrent temporal changes in the
