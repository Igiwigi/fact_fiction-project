with a radial structure bear the same relation to it as any two adjacent septa bear to
the palus between them. The tangential expansion of the calyx follows in fact the
same system throughout, and a mural ring of thickening might in some cases arise
round the pali, in which ease the “septa” would be looked upon as ‘‘ costee.”

The cost present between adjacent polyps are placed opposite every angle of the
zig-zag mural ring, Secondary thickening not only tends to solidify the wall, but
frequently produces in addition an outer ring of thickening, halfway between
adjacent polyps. Its Microscopic Structure,

Figs. 65 and 66 are made from the uppermost portions of the corallum of Porites
tnerustuns (DE¥r.). ‘Looking at a transverse microscopic section, first with hand lens
only, a loose tissue is seen in which radial lines of structure are much less pronounced
than in Astreids. The cause of this is that we have not in Porttes one continuous
broad calcareous structure, but a series of compound trabecule varying little in size
and shape.
