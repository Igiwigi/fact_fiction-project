From what has now been advanced, it is clear that the idea of the composition of
the fasciculi by fibrille: requires considerable qualification. They split up, indeed, in
general into fibrillze, but in other cases their natural cleavage is into discs, and in all
instances these discs exist quite as unequivocally as the fibrillze themselves. In fact,
the primitive fasciculus seems to consist of primitive component segments or particles,
arranged $0 as to form, in one sense, fibrillze, and in another sense, discs; and which
of these two may happen to present themselves to the observer, will depend on the
amount of adhesion, endways or sideways, existing between the segments. Generally,
in a recent fasciculus, there are transverse $triz, showing divisions into discs, and
longitudinal striz, marking its composition by fibrillzee. The reason why the trans-
verse striz are ordinarily 80 much more decided, is that the fibrillee are more close
together than the discs, and their shaded interspaces consequently narrower.
