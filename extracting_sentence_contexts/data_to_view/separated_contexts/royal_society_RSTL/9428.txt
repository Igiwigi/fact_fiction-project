We find both edges of gome
bands to accord with the position of known hydrogen lines, whilst in others we find
that only one edge can be 80 marked. Though direct evidence is wanting to enable
us to say that the other edge marks the position of a hydrogen line, yet the cireum-
stantial evidence that such is the case is excessively strong. In point of fact, of the
hydrogen lines and edges of bands to be found in hydrocarbons lying between 900
and 972 of our empiric scale, more than half are to be found coincident with lines in
the non-carbon bodies. The following table shows the coincidences :â€”

or nitrogen,
or chlorine

On the more refrangible side of 900 the coincidences in the latter series are always
to be found in the former. If other bodies containing no carbon be examined no
doubt some of the gaps in the table will be filled up.
