Reynolds observes that Biitschli’s account of B. lacustris only differs from B. kepneri
in that he does not describe the ‘peristomial flap’, and that he records a tendency to
form colonies. Of the differences between B. lacustris and B. kepneri only (6), in my
opinion, is worthy of serious consideration. According to Reynolds, Stein’s figures
suggest the relation between lorica and peristome described by him, but Stein ‘fails
to point out the fact that the protoplasmic sheet is actually attached to the extended
wall of the test. Indeed he shows it distinctly unattached in one of his drawings.’ This
is misleading.
