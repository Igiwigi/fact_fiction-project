An iodine estimation was then carried out on the product from Z by precipitating
the iodine with silver nitrate in aqueous solution in presence of HNO. The silver
iodide was collected on a Gooch crucible and weighed.

0-0833 gm. of the trialkylphenylammonium iodide from Z gave 0-0739 gm. of Agl,
corresponding to 47-9 per cent. iodine.

Cale. for methyl compound, 48-3 per cent.
Cale. for ethyl compound, 45-8 per cent.
Cale. for propyl compound, 43-6 per cent.

The result agrees most closely with the methyl compound. Further support was
obtained for the belief that the compound is really a methyl compound from the fact
that a mixture of ethyliodide and dimethylaniline could not be induced to form crystals.
Methyl iodide gives crystals immediately as did the product from Z.

Z therefore contains one methoxyl group.

Action of hydroxylamine on Z.—0-2 gm. of Z, 0:5 gm. of hydroxylamine hydro-
chloride, and 15 ¢.c. of absolute alcohol were boiled under a reflux condenser for 14
hours. There was no separation of an oxime and 0-12 gm. of Z was recovered
unchanged. It may be concluded, therefore, that Z does not form an oxime under
these conditions.
