It will be seen that excitation was transmitted as usual, the
velocity of transmission in this case being 29 mm. per sec. The specimen was

exceptionally vigorous and the season the height of summer, which facts account for
the high velocity. The blocking current was next introduced. In order to prevent
the excitation due to sudden make of current, the applied E.M.F. was gradually
increased from zero to 2 volts, by means of a potential slide.
