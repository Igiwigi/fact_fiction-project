For
TIRF-SIM, the structured illumination pattern has a finer frequency than that permitted by the
refractive index of the sample, and so Heintzmann says that TIRF-SIM breaks this ‘restricted super
resolution’ criterion. Hence, the suggestion is that TIRF-SIM is not diffraction-limited even under
the considerations of this more strict approach. However, the fact remains that the fineness of the illumination pattern is limited by diffraction,
just in a medium of refractive index n rather than 2. Even in the situation where the sample was
mounted on a diamond coverslip (ignoring the deleterious effects of the strong dispersion in such
a material) and we had an objective lens with numerical aperture matching that of the refractive
index of the material, 2.4, TIRF-SIM of the same sample as Li et al. used could not produce a
resolution better than

(; + ) 488nm 510nm 65.6nm (32)

illumination emission

Hence, this author would class this as extended resolution, not super resolution or even enhanced
resolution.
