Similarly Newcoms,* after a most careful
examination of the same records, arrives at a period of 11°13 years. It needs to be
é explained why the years in which, according to our results, the periodicity was
apparently absent do not affect the mean duration of the period, so that the same
value is obtained whether the time during which the periodicity is ea hypothesi
absent is included in the calculations or not. My first impression was that the
coincidence was partly a matter of accident and partly due to the fact that both
observers attached weights to the times of the observed maxima according to their
trustworthiness. The weights thus attached to the records of the last 70 years
naturally much exceeded those with which previous records were credited. Hence
the whole result might very well be found to depend on the later periods only.
