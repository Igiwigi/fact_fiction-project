These setae are mentioned by Miiller. The entrance gaps to the
sieve are therefore closed posteriorly by a dense felt-work of setae. Anteriorly the exit gaps from the sieve apparatus are closed owing to the fact that each
double row of plates takes its origin anteriorly in a prominent cushion-like swelling at the
level of the junction between the crop and proventriculus. There are therefore eight of these
cushions (figures 14, 15 and 16, c.sp.) disposed regularly around the entrance to the pro-
ventriculus. Each cushion bears a characteristic armature.
