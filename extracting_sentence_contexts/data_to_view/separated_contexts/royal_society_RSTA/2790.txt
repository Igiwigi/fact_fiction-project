Though often downplayed in the community, preservation bias presents a serious
problem to our inquiry to the history of plate tectonics. The primary function of plate tectonics
may be described as destroying geological records by subduction, so the absence of evidence is
clearly not the evidence of absence. Also, what has been preserved to the present may not be
representative of what has been lost by subduction; the very fact of being preserved, despite
the destructive nature of plate tectonics, may require some special conditions [6]. In spite of
these obvious concerns, arguments based on preservation bias are usually discouraged because
they are hard (if not impossible) to test. However, if we can build a physics-based theory for
the coupled ocean-crustâ€”-mantle evolution, such a theory could also quantify the preservation


likelihood of a certain geological record, providing a statistical basis for the discussion of its
rarity.
