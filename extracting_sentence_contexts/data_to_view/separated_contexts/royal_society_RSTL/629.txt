Lastly, Fig. 17 exhibits a detached crystal, of a perfectly de-
terminate form, and of about an inch in length, seven lines in
breadth, and five lines in height, which makes part of the col-
lection of Mr. Patties, who was 80 kind as to allow me to
examine it, as well as every other specimen of this substance in
his possession. ' It is, in fact, the variety represented in Fig. 16,
but in which the planes belonging to the fourth modification
have acquired a more considerable extent; while those which
belong to the third modification exist only on two of the op-

posite edges of the terminal faces, as was- observed in speaking
of the crystal represented in Fig. 10.
