Some difficulty was occasioned by the fact that in this case neither B, nor «, are

consequence that neither of these quantities is strictly constant. The correction to
B which is in question is so small, however, that it appeared to be quite satisfactory
to use mean values for « and «,. D, having been determined, it becomes possible to calculate the term involving it,
subtract this from the observed combination difference and thence derive an improved
value of B.
