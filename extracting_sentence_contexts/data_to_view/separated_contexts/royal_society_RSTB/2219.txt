It is very obvious from the above that in these spinal reflexes of the limb certain
limb movements are of very preponderant occurrence ; in other words, certain func-
tional groups of motor neurons are less easily excited than others by the incoming
local impulses. SanpERS-Ezy,* ScuioEssEr,t and Lomparp { have pointed out how
difficult it is to evoke extension of the knee as a spinal reflex movement. In a pre-
vious paper I noted that in the Monkey the representations of movement in the cord,
as tested by excitation of the ventral spinal root and of the dorsal (afferent) root, do
not coincide ; in fact, by no means coincide. Sanpers-Ezy,ยง Lompanrp,|| and myself
have pointed out that the movement elicited by excitation of the afferent root is
often widely different, or even the converse, of that evoked by excitation of the
efferent root corresponding. The list of reflex movements gives many examples, In
Monkey, the VIIth post-thoracie afferent root provokes flexion of ankle; the
corresponding motor root gives extension at ankle.
