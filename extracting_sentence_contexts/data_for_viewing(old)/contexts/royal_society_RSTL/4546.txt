it follows, from the view I have given of the mutual relation of these particles, and the
interdependence of these chemical changes, that we cannot substitute for the barium
a metal which stands in a different chemical relation to the particles between which
it is placed without altering the relation of all the other particles of the system, 80
that if the chemical difference on which combination depends does not exist between
the metal and the iodine, neither can it exist between the particles of the oxygen. In
this way the fact, at first sight very anomalous, admits of a very simple explanation,

* I by no means wish to exclude from these a real chemical difference in their nature, which the behaviour
of certain analogous bodies leads me to suspect.

that the peroxide of barium, the less reducible peroxide, is that which under these
cirenmstances is thus readily decomposed.
