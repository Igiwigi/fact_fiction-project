AND ON THE DIURNAL INEQUALITY. 29

Swan River, on the west, it principally affects the times. And the diurnal inequality
which alters the low water four feet at Port Essington, and six feet at Sincapore,
affects the high water to a till greater extent in the Gulf of Cambay, and disturbs
the times at the entrance of the Persian Gulf.

Where the diurnal inequality affects the heights s0 much, it probably affects mate-
rially the time of tide in all places, as we know it does in some. And therefore
over the whole of the Indian seas, the terms © establishment” and © tide-hour” must,
without further explanation, be very ambiguous. And as we cannot know what facts
are designated by such terms in books of navigation, all attempts to found upon
such statements a coherent view of the tides of those seas, must be very precarious*,

52. Upon the occasion of the great series of tide obseryations made in 1835, I was
led to trace the progress of the diurnal inequality wave along the coast of Europe.
This I attempted in the Eighth Series of these Tide Researches-F. The difficulty of
separating the diurnal from the semidiurnal wave was there in some degree overcome.
But even in that case, the problem was very imperfectly solved ; for the coasts of the
Pacific, and even for the coasts of Australia, our materials are too scanty and discon-
nected to give ns any hope of success at present, if we were to attempt the same
problem. With due materials, the diurnal inequality appears plainly to be separable
from the semidiurnal tide; for it sometimes affects high water most, sometimes low
