Of course we know that the final maturation of the egg, or the giving off of the
polar bodies, awaits in most animals the act of fertilization. But here the effect is produced upon the egg
by the entrance of sperms. How mating itself, and the act of copulation could influence the ripening of
the egg in the ovary is another problem, In this connection the curious fact must be mentioned that
two female Pigeons placed in confinement together may both take to laying eggs. The function of
ovulation is in a state of tension, so to speak, that requires only a slight stimulus, ‘mental’ apparently in
this case, to set the mechanism working.” These observations are especially interesting in view of the fact
that they were apparently written in ignorance of what is known to occur in regard to ovulation in the
Rabbit, the Sheep and the Ferret ; for HARPER says: “from analogy with the mammal and with many birds,
such as the common Fowl, we commonly think of ovulation as an exclusively female function, going on
regardless of whether the eggs produced are fertilised or not.”
