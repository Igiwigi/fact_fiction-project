all decomposed (408.). If flint-glass, which contains substances more directly op-
posed, be operated upon, it suffers some decomposition ; and if borate of lead glass,
which is a definite chemical compound, be experimented with, it readily yields up its
elements (408).

674. But the result which is found to be s0 striking in the instances quoted is not
at all borne out by reference to other cases where a similar consequence might have
been expected. It may be said, that my own theory of electro-chemical decomposition
would lead to the expectation that all compound bodies should give way under the
influence of the electric current with a facility proportionate to the strength of the
affinity by which their elements, either proximate or ultimate, are combined. I am
not sure that that follows as a consequence of the theory ; but if the objection be
supposed one presented by facts, I have no doubt it will be removed when we obtain
a more intimate acquaintance with, and precise idea of, the nature of chemical
affinity and the mode of action of an electric current over it (518. 524.) : besides which,
it is just as directly opposed to any other theory of electro-chemical decomposition as
the one I have propounded ; for if it be admitted, as is generally the case, that the
more directly bodies are opposed to each other in their attractive forces, the more
powerfully do they combine, then the objection applies with equal force to any of

the theories of electrolyzation which have been considered, and is an addition to those
which I have taken against them.
