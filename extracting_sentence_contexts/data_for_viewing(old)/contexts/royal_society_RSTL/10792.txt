3 As far as we are aware, no suggestion has yet been made as to the cause of the
Aiscontinuity. We have necessarily had our attention directed to it, and, though our
Wiews are at present little more than speculations, yeb it may perhaps conduce to a
Auxoful discussion if we suggest a cause which might, we think, furnish a satisfactory

lation of the difficulty.

6 Suggestion as to the Cause of the Discontinuity at the Edge of the
= Black Part of a Soap Film.

S It may be convenient if we collect together the various facts which constitute all
hat is certainly known as to the behaviour and constitution of a black film,

1.* The black part of a soap film in equilibrium, and not snbjected to the action of
an external force, is always separated from the rest of the film by a clearly defined
boundary.

A gradual transition from the black to the thicker parts of the film is only observed
either in a film which thins rapidly and breaks soon (when it is a very transient
phenomenon) or when an electric current is passed through the film.

2. The discontinuity in the thickness indicated at the boundary varies very much
