On the other hand, for the second-phase transition observed for p
at Pp = Pca = 1 â€” 3w/g, the analytical results suggest an active-absorbing phase transition, since the
critical exponent is 8 = Bcp = 1 [45]. Indeed, we also obtained an analytical result f,1 = fo =f_1 =0,
see equations (3.7), (3.8) and (3.9), i.e. it is the absorbing state where p = 0. In this case, the fraction
of active agents needs to be zero even in the computer simulations, which in fact we observed (see
the red stars in figure 1b). Figure 2 shows additional results for m and p for g=1 and typical values of the deactivation
probability w. In figure 2a, we exhibit the curves for m and p for w =0.2.
