A specimen
in this state is presented in fig. 9, from the Boa. The fibrillze here seen are all marked. This fact proves that marked fibrille exist in the interior of the fasciculus, and is not
at all controverted by the circumstance that sometimes the surface of snch a lacera-
tion does not show a structure of this kind, the violence inflicted by the instrument
being sufficient to account for the destruction or mutilation of parts of 80 much
delicacy. If further evidence be wanting, it may be drawn from the writings of authors. It
is highly probable that Hooks *, when he hinted to the Royal Society that © he knew
of a method of making succedaneous muscles, to give one man the strength of ten or
twenty if required,” had in view these marked fibrillze, which he thought a series of
bladders.
