the frictionless case, but in the last frame, at t= T, the loss is remarkable. Since the material is
damaged the waves travel with a lower velocity and we note a delay between the arrival time
of the wave with and without friction. We conclude that the friction in the damage model has a
non-negligible influence on the amplitude and on the speed of the loading wave.

We have plotted in figure 4 the final crack density ; for each micro-crack family. We note
that the damage is affected on each direction on different regions of the sample. That means that
the final waves’ speed map is not isotropic and this anisotropy is not homogeneous. The most
affected is the second family of micro-cracks (62 = 1/2 working in mode I), while for the third and
fourth families (9 = +7/4 working in mode II) the affected regions have no horizontal symmetry.
Moreover, we remark that the damage in the frictionless case is much more developed than for the
frictional case. Indeed, the friction force reduces the tangential stress acting on the micro-cracks
and as a consequence the crack-growth is reduced (or absent) in mode II. This fact is more visible
for the cracks orientated at @ = +7/4 and at @ = 7/2. We have also noted that each damage pattern
