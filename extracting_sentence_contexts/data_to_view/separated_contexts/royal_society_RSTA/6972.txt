These terms will be present in the equations for all
the higher order functions, so that the same situation will occur in them. On the other hand,
the coefficients of these terms include a factor n, and they are therefore absent for n = 0,
and the condition that 4, 7) should tend to asymptotic values no longer determines these
values. Further if Z is written for (7—c), it follows from (9-13) that for large 7

Now two solutions of the equation

are (Hartree 1935) exactly, not only asymptotically, a polynomial of degree n in z (in fact
the Hermite polynomial of order n and argument iz) and the n-fold integral of the error
function, with integration constants chosen so that this integral is zero at infinity, which is
of order e~7*/Z"*" for large Z. Since h,—+ is zero at infinity, it follows that if it is satisfied
(10-13) exactly, it would have this behaviour at infinity, but since terms of order ne”
have been omitted in equation (10-13) it follows that h, is of the same order. This argument can be extended.
