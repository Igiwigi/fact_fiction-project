Neuromodulation has been used to characterize the nature
of somatosensory inputs to DCN. Electrical microstimulation
of MSN strongly modulates DCN activity in cats [99] through
a mixture of inhibitory and excitatory effects that depend on
cell type [100]. Microstimulation of the trigeminal nuclei also
produces complex interaction patterns in the guinea pig DCN
[101]. These results clearly indicate that the DCN does not
exclusively respond to auditory stimulation.

The observation that mechanical stimulation of the pinna
and vibrissae, but not other body regions, drives DCN activity
[99] implies that somatosensory inputs to DCN may serve
specific functions. In fact, muscle-related somatosensory stimu-
lation of the pinna drives DCN activity most robustly [102].
These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that somato-
sensory inputs to DCN modulate auditory responses in
behaviourally meaningful ways: excitatory interactions that
amplify auditory signals can result from pinna movements
related to spatial orienting while inhibitory interactions can
suppress sound processing related to self-generated move-
ments [98,103]. Importantly, because the DCN occupies a
relatively early processing stage in the auditory pathway,
somatosensory information accessing DCN circuits necessarily
propagates to all levels of the auditory system that receive direct
or indirect inputs from DCN [99].
