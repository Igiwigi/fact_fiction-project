377: 20190220. by the computer program in this article was, in
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2019.0220 fact, triggered by a programming glitch which caused

an unintended abrupt change of Biot coefficient for
transverse water pressure on the crack. This change
suddenly increased the pressure on the solid phase
and triggered dynamic response. Such a sudden trigger
is probably unrealistic and requires correction. The
correction nevertheless reveals a useful fact, namely that
producing fluid pressure shocks within the cracks would
locally stimulate branching. A partly revised model,
which is based mostly on the mathematical formulation
from this paper leads to crack branching similar to what
is seen in the figures of this paper, has been published by
