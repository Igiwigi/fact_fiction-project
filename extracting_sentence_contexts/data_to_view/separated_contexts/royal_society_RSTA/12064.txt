Hence, d;, only appears when both p, and p, are greater than zero. It follows

hat the products which involve ),, only enumerate by their coefficients those per-

mutations which possess a, contacts. In fact, the absence of either «, or a, by

using Ay, to vanish, diminishes the total number of permutations which have a

definite number of major contacts ; this would not be the case if the terms comprising

Ay, as a factor did not enumerate «x, contacts; if #,«, contacts were not enumerated,

he vanishing of «, or #, would not alter the enumeration of the permutations

possessing a given number of contacts, for this given number would be complete
ithout #%, contacts at all,

It is next to be shown that a product involving ,;"" comprises exactly s,,, a %,

ontacts,

Suppose p, + 831, Py < sy

Then «, occurs less than s,, times. And, therefore, \,2) cannot be raised to the power 3»). And, therefore, \,, cannot occur in any term to so high a power as 53).
