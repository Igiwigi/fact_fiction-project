Then

ele (9) — Ng, (9)) = 0. If the centre of S, is not a boundary point of the convex closure of the common part of W and
the circumference of ©,, we have, in fact,

Ny (») = Ne, (9)

for all sufficiently large | 9\. As corollary of Theorem 19 we have

~ Nw (9) = il 5
jm pet Peck Gite (75)

where r, is the radius of ©,. The existence of the limit in (75) was proved by Rarrt for the case when WM is a

polygon.
