does not account for the fluidity or coagulation of the blood within the yessels. But the facts mentioned
by that gentleman in the valuable exsay which has gained the las} A8TLEY Cooper prize, and also my; owty
experience [xee the paper before referred to], haye convinced me that a certain amount of the volatile alkali
does exist in freshly-drawn blood, and that it has the effect of retarding the process of coagulation. This
principle must be borne in mind in all experiments upon this subject, in order to understand circumstances
which would otherwise be inexplicable. Thus, if the foot of a sheep be obtained with the blood retained in
the vessels by a bandage applied before the death of the animal, and, after reflection of the skin, a needle be
introduced into a vein by a free opening made by the scissors, a deposit of fibrine will be found upon it in
perhaps five minutes; but if the needle. Ã¾e pushed through the coats of 8uch a yein, 80 as to introduce ib
without previous wound of the vessel, and allow little opportunity for ezcape of ammonia, the deposit will,
not take place for a quarter of an hour or more.
