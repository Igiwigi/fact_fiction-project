Sheffield (1936)
has shown that mitosis takes place in the local lesions in Nicotiana glutinosa following
inoculation with aucuba mosaic. Whether such occurs in the sugar beet local lesions
has not been established, but the type of conversion we are considering in these in
vitro mixtures is obviously independent of mitotic activity. The facts so far recorded relating to the conversion of the virus X strains allow of the
recognition of certain definite types of behaviour.

(a) Within the environment of a single species host such as tobacco growing under
more or less constant conditions, sudden change of strain is very rare.

(6) In the majority of cases where change has taken place, interference with the pH
and other physical conditions of the sap inoculum has taken place, e.g. in the process
of purification. Such changes have been far commoner than in passages arising from
raw juice.

(c) Passage of the X virus through solanaceous plants other than certain varieties of
the potato has failed to bring about any change.

(d) Passages through horse bean and beet have effected an immediate change of
type of virulence in at least part of the virus which gained an entry and multiplied
within the local lesions induced.

(e) Conversion has been effected in vitro by mixing X% infected tobacco juice with
that of healthy sugar beet.

(f) Every example of strain conversion occurring spontaneously or artificially
induced has been from a higher to a lower virulence.
