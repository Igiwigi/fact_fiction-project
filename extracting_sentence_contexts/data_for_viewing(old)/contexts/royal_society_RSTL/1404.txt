farther in, the roof and sides become irregularly arched, pre-
senting a very rugged and grotesque appearance, and being

lactite ; the bottom of the cavern is visible only near the
entrance; and its irregularities, though apparently not great,
have been filled up throughout to a nearly level surface, by
the introduction of a bed of mud or sediment, the history of
which, and also of the stalactite, I shall presently describe.
(See Plate X VI. fig. 2).

The fact already mentioned of the engulphment of the Rical
Beck, and other adjacent rivers, as they cross the lime-stone,
showing it to abound with many similar cavities to those at
Kirkdale, renders it likely that, hereafter, similar deposits of
bones may be discovered in this same neighbourhood; but

and gravel, or post=diluvian detritus ; so that nothing but their
