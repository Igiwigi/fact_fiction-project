In the present view, rather than merely unknown, the workings of this black box
are beyond conception, in parallel with strong RWR interpretations of QM, where the black box
is that between phenomena registered in observational instruments in quantum experiments. Targue more generally that what is shared by quantum theory, QM (to which I shall continue to
restrict myself) or QFT, and Q-L theories is their Q-L ontological and epistemological architecture,
especially the irreducible interference of observation, complementarity, probabilistic causality,
and the arrow of events, all interpreted in RWR terms [29,30]. It follows and, in fact, is assumed
first that in Q-L theories, an observation is a creation of phenomena by means of the interactions
between one or another agency with the ultimate reality considered (such as certain strata of
matter or thought, especially the unconscious) rather than observing or measuring the pre-
existing or even contemporaneous properties of this reality. In strong RWR interpretations, the
ultimate constitution of the reality responsible for thinking cannot be thought (even if one leaves
aside the role of the brain), any more than that of the material reality responsible for quantum
phenomena could be in strong RWR interpretations. The first reality is, however, unique to each
of us, while the second is shared by us.
