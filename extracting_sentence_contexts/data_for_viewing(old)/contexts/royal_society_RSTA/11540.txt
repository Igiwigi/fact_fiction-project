Tue object of the experiments described below was to determine how much of the
contraction, which occurs in a nickel wire when magnetised, is due to stresses brought
into play by magnetisation. This has been attempted by several experimenters, but
it has been assumed by some that the magnetic stress concerned is a contracting stress
of magnitude B?/87, an assumption which has only recently been shown to be
unjustifiable.*

That the system of stresses in a magnetic field, described by Maxwett (‘“ Elec-
tricity and Magnetism,” Art. 642) as explaining the observed forces hetween
magnetic bodies, is not sufficient to account for the observed deformation of bodies in
the field, is clear from the fact that these stresses increase continually with the
magnetisation and field-strength, while the deformation in iron and cobalt becomes
reversed when the field reaches a certain value. It can also be shown that
MAXwWELL’s stresses would produce no change in the dimensions of a ring magnetised
by a uniform circumferential field, whereas Biowetut has found considerable change
both in the diameter and the volume of rings of iron.

The theory of magnetic stress has, however, been extended, chiefly by v. Hetm-
HoLTz,{ KrrconHorr,§ Professor J. J. THomson,|| and Herrz,‘) who have shown that,
in addition to MAxwe t’s distribution of stress, there are other stresses in a mag-
netised body due to the fact that the magnetisation depends upon the strain in
the body.
