ventricle (fig. 7) becomes reduced to an extremely small canal, triangular in outline,
with the apex directed downward; in ome specimens the lumen is scarcely perceptible.
This corresponds to the narrower portion of the Å¿ourth ventricle in M. cephalus ; after
this it again enlarges (fig. 6) beneath the cerebellum, and shows a triangular lumen
which seems to correspond to the anterior end of the fourth ventricle in other Teleostei;
beyond this it again becomes contracted as the aqueduct of Sylvius (fig. 4) into a very
small perpendicular elit, which s00n extends through the hypoarium nearly to the
inferior surface of the brain (fig. 3). This slit is occupied in its centre by a small coil
of an epithelial tubular structure, which appears to correspond to the saccus vasculosus
of the ordinary Teleostei. After this the aqueduct opens into what would be the
ventricle of the optic lobe, were it not that it is quite open to the external surface,
and by the peculiar position of the tecta, has come to be above instead of below
them. The growth of the wings in fact has quite forced open this ventricle and
