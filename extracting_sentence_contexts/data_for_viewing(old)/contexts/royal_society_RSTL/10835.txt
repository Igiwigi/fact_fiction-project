RESEARCHES IN MAGNETISM. 525

The fact that iron possesses retentiveness, or, in other words, that it remains
- magnetic after a magnetising force has been applied and removed, is of itself sufficient
that there must be hysteresis in the relation of magnetism to magnetising force,
when the changes of the latter are snch that forces of opposite signs are alternately
applied. But it does not follow that hysteresis is necessarily present when the changes
of magnetising force are restricted to one direction and to one s8ign. The case may be
gupposed similar to that of a strained solid. When a stress along any axis is alter-
nately applied and reversed, we know that (provided the resulting strain exceeds the
body's limit of elasticity) there is hysteresis, of a simple and obvious character, in the
elation of strain to stress. But if, instead of being reversed, the stress is merely
Ipplied and removed periodically, the greater part, if not the whole of the resulting
ange of strain, (after the firs6 application) is purely elastic, and we have no ground
EM asserting that there will then be hysteresis in the relation of strain to stress. In
