Evxx in the earliest times the attention of chemists seems to have been directed to the
symbolic expression of the facts of their science, a method which had its origin in the

mystic spirit of alchemy, and the subject has never ceased to occupy a prominent Po8i-
tion in chemical philosophy. However, the development of our symbolic system has by
no means kept pace with the general progress of the science. Indeed no exxential
improvement in the method has been effected since its first invention by Berzeavs;
and though this notation has doubtless afforded much aid to memory, and through
memory incidentally to reasoning, yet it is difficult to point to even one discovery in
the science, for which we are indebted to symbolic operations. In this respect chemical
