space, and its function is disturbed if it touches the sides of the thorax or abdomen. Some
means of limiting its amplitude of oscillation is therefore demanded.

Experiment 4 shows that some of the sensilla are excited at two instants in the cycle, and
it seems probable that these are at the moments of greatest angular acceleration, i.e. at
the ends of the stroke. The asymmetry of the spikes, even with normal oscillation, can be
explained if the reversal at the top of the stroke is more rapid than at the bottom; this is
consistent with the form of the haltere oscillation sometimes observed. The fact that at
full amplitude the volleys consist of a number of spikes suggests that more than one group of
sensilla is being excited, and possibly that the laterally sensitive groups (basal plate and
large chordotonal organ) are also being excited by the large forces produced by the rapid
angular accelerations. To be completely insensitive to these ‘primary’ forces while re-
taining sensitivity to the gyroscopic forces which are about zj5th of the magnitude, the
orientation of the basal plate sensilla would have to be correct to better than 1° relative
to the position of the centre of gravity of the moving portion of the haltere, and if this
were an essential feature of the mechanism it is unlikely that it would function correctly, as
it does, after complete heat coagulation of the contents of the end-knob (Sellke 1936).

Experiment 5 gives the results of rotation in yaw. At the beginning and end of rotation
the lateral gyroscopic forces are increasing or decreasing, while the component of the
