On the other hand, the main swinging out of the body is the work of the attrahens muscle,
and one of the first effects of the contraction of this muscle will be to pull the oral cone
forwards and press it on to the adductor scutorum. Not only will it bring the cone up
against this muscle, but will press it into the latter (figure 7). In fact, from the arrangement
and size of the various parts of the body I do not think it possible for the body to be
extruded without this taking place. The adductor scutorum during this phase will be
relaxed and therefore soft, and so will offer little resistance to such a process. Now, the
main result of this will be that as long as the body is being thrown out, the region between
the oral cone and the adductor muscle will be squeezed out of existence, and in this region
is the blood pump.
