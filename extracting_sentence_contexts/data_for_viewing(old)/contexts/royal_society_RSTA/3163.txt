To determine the spectral (and nonlinear) stability of a pinned 1-pulse solution Up(x), which is
to leading order given by (2.8), we linearize (2.1) around Up(x). As alluded to in the Introduction,
the linearized operator has no essential spectrum [27] in the right-half plane. Hence, we focus on
the point spectrum of the linearized operator. The associated eigenvalue problem determining
the point spectrum op; is obtained by substituting the ansatz U(x, t) = Up(x) + eM y(x), with
AEC \ ess with cess = (—00, —], into (2.1) and linearizing the resulting expression. This gives

The spatial localization of the impurity and the fact that Up is to leading order constant in the
fast field I; allows us to treat (2.9) in a similar fashion as (2.2). In fact, in the slow regions IE the
impurity is exponentially small and the slow flow of (2.9) is approximated by

dx (2.10)

dq _
and aden (u + A)p.

Hence, the leading order slow flow of (2.9) in the slow regions can be obtained from the leading
order slow flow of (2.3) by replacing with + a. In particular, Asq(p) = —2\/u + Ap. In the fast
region near the origin, the impurity is dominating the dynamics of (2.9). Moreover, since Up = it
to leading order in the fast field, the fast flow of (2.9) is approximated by
