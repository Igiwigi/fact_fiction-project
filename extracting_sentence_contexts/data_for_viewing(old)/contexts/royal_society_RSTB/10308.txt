1.6 times those of typical wind speeds [4,5]. This is equivalent to a Boeing 747
having to operate in winds of some 780 kmh‘'. In fact, even though wind
speeds are a much lower proportion of the flight speeds of commercial aircraft
(the ratio of flight speed to flow speed is in the order of 9.7: 1), wind speed is

still a key determinant of fuel consumption, journey time and flight route.

The fact that air is almost never still provides animals with potential opportu-
nities as well as challenges. Organisms from aphids to eagles time their flights in
order to exploit particular flow vectors [6,7], enabling them to travel with very low
energetic costs [8]. Movement timing is one of the simplest responses to airflows
in the behavioural repertoire, although it is an interesting one, as periods of inac-
tivity, as well as avoidance of particular airspace, may provide insight into the
environmental factors that represent limits to flight performance. Animals also
modulate their flight speed, route and mode (e.g. flapping versus soaring) in
relation to airflows to reduce their costs of transport. One area of research
advanced in this issue is how these responses may be modulated further by
risk. In most ecological areas of research, risk is associated with predation or
the ability to find food. While both these factors can exert powerful influences
on flying animals [9,10], there are other types of risk, some of which are uniquely
