In perusal of the original paper by Hiasrwetz, one notes at the outset that
author entirely ignored the presence of ammonia in his tubes, though, at th
temperature he employed (190° C.), ammonium carbonate is formed in quantit
before the yellow product has appeared at all. His procedure was to concentra
the solution direct, and to filter off “the yellow, flocky, gelatinous, uncrystallizal
substance,” which separated on cooling. It was this product he analysed. Now,
the figures given by his analyses be examined, they will be seen to agree closely
with those proper to ammonium urate, whereas they are only made to agree with #l

composition usually assigned to mycomelic acid by the purely gratuitous assumpto
of a retained half molecule of water. As a matter of fact, the aqueous solutid
of a yellow product, prepared exactly in accordance with the directions given,
Hrastwerz (loc, cit.), will be found, if boiled up with animal charcoal and filtered, to yie!
a colourless filtrate, from which, on acidification, uric acid crystals separate in que
colourless condition. The weight of these, calculated to ammonium urate, will
found to represent a very large fraction of the total yellow substance taken to be
with charcoal. It is, however, not wholly surprising that HrasrwETz was led
look upon his product (which was obtained at temperatures higher than those wi
