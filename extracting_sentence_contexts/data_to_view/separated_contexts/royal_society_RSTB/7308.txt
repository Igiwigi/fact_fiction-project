The testicular ampullae in their earliest stages of formation bear a striking resemblance
to young ovarian follicles, a single large cell being enclosed in a sheath formed from a few
flattened ones. This arrangement is derived, as noted by Sabatier (1895), from nests of cells
in which one enlarges and becomes the ‘ovule’ surrounded by the others. Indeed, several
authors, for example, Semper (1875) and Herrmann (1881), speak of this original cell as the
‘egg-cell’, ‘ovum’ or ‘male ovule’, and Moore (1894) went so far as to say that the immature
gonads in ‘the future male Scyllium are conspicuously hermaphroditic’, and suggested that he
was unable to find any reference to this fact in the literature because ‘as the testes grow older
the hermaphroditic character dies out’. It would appear to be more appropriate to regard
the young stage merely as sexually undifferentiated until good grounds are brought
forward for attributing the characters of both sexes to the immature gonad. The Sertoli cells are large, but this character is masked by the presence of the sperma-
tozoa, so that it is not until the ampullae are discharged that it is fully revealed.
