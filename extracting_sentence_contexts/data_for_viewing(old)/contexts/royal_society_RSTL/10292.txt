on reversing the object, 80 that the lower side of the hypha comes uppermost, this
brilliant pore-like spot appears much more evident, and is clearly due to a thinning in
the wall of the under side of the hypha, at a spot where no colouring matter is
deposited in the cell-walls, and where the contained protoplasm is placed more nearly
in connexion with the outside (see Plate 48, fig. 7, and Plate 44, figs. 21, 40).

BokNET apparently refers to these bright spots when he peaks of oily globules in
the interior of the hyphe,* though he may have been speaking of actual oil-drops
developed in the dried specimens with which he chiefly worked. If Borxer's remarks
refer to the bright spots here described, the facts of their appearing only on the lower
wall, and not being altered by alcohol, &c., remain to be explained.

Taking all the facts into account, the view geems to recommend itself that these
bright spots are the points of attachment of the hyphe to the epidermis ; if 80, they
are to be regarded as haustoria of a very rudimentary nature. The mycelium
certainly is attached to the surface of the leaf, though but feebly, and it appears
suggestive that alcohol specimens are more easily detached than fresh ones, possibly
because the protoplasm becomes contracted and rendered brittle. No other anchoring
bodies have been observed, and one notes that the position of these brilliant spots
accords with that of the well-developed haustoria in Asterina,} a genus of fungi at
least allied to the Meliolas. These bright points are not always present, and in
s0me cages seem to be normally absent. They are very generally formed at once on
germination, appearing on the first short tubes put forth by the spore (fig. 40),
a condition of things which may again be compared to what occurs in Asterina,y
and also in Prysiphe and allied forms.|| Still another point reminding us of Asterina
