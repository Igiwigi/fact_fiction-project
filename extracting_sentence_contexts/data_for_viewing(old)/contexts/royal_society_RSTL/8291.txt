but such is certainly not the case. The parenchyma with which it is 8urrounded is
identical with that separating all the prosenchymatous laminee, leaving little reason to
question that one of the parenchymatous areolze of the outer bark has been specially ſ
enlarged to admit of the outward transmission of the vascular bundle and its thick paren-
chymatous investment, the vertical prosenchymatous layers (, &) having been thrust ©
apart, to make room for this enlargement and transmission. l

These conditions suggest the possibility that others of the cortical bundles may finally
leave the woody zone and pass outwards to supply foliar appendages with vascular tissue.
The large size of these bundles indicates (supposing the above suggestion to be correct)
that the missing appendages have been of corresponding dimensions. They suggest
fronds rather than leaves. It is impossible to reason upon such limited data with any
confidence ; but I shall recall attention to the facts just described when I proceed, on 80me
future occasion, to examine the stems or petioles to which I haye proposed to assign the
provisional name of Fdraxylon®*.

'Y [ OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES. 393

Our history of what is known of this remarkable plant is not yet exhausted. On
examining the fine series of coal-plants in the Liverpool Museum, which owes 80 much
to the ever-vigilant energy of the Rey. H. H. Hic6xs, of Rainhill, I detected a series of
cortical impressions which evidently belonged to an arborescent tree, and which I at once
