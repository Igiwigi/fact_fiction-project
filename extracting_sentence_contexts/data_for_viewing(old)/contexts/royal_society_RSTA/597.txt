is higher in the presence of soot due to the increased NO2 SCR activity. During the temperature
ramp, a similar amount of NHz is observed ‘with soot’ and ‘without soot’. This is most likely
because copper zeolites store very large quantities of NH3 [30,45] that are quite similar both
‘with’ and ‘without’ the presence of soot and although a small increase in ammonia storage
in the presence of soot was visible in the NH3 TPD experiment (figure 1). However, as NO
is present from the nitrate decomposition during the TPD after the NH3 + NO2 + Oz +H20
exposure, reactions between ammonia and NO) are likely occurring which result in the ammonia
desorption peak being slightly different compared to NH3 TPD.

Furthermore, figure 8 presents the N2O formation during the temperature ramp after
adsorption at 150, 175 and 200°C for ‘without’ and ‘with’ soot cases. In addition, the quantified
results for the N2O production are shown in figure 9. It is well known that the ammonium nitrates
become unstable at higher temperatures [29,46] and that this fact correlates with NO formation
(figure 9). In general, less amounts of nitrous oxides are produced when soot is present in the SCR-
coated filter after exposure to NH3, NO2, Oz and HO, evidently emphasizing the suppression of
ammonium nitrate formation or its easier decomposition in the presence of soot. This trend has
also been observed in our previous study conducted on SCR-coated particulate filter for NH3-SCR
reactions [36]. Finally, it was found that less N2O was formed after reaction at 200°C (figures 8d
and 9) which was due to lower ammonium nitrate formation at a higher temperature, which was
also observed for Cu/BEA [30].

4. Conclusion

The behaviour of an SCR catalyst-coated filter in the reactions involving ammonia storage, NO2
SCR, as well as the formation and decomposition of ammonium nitrate has been examined in this
