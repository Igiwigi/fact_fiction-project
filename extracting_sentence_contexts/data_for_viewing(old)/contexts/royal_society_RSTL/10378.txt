' OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES. 471

Salisburia, whether in its young state, when the inner bark consists, as represented in
fig. 28, of undifferentiated primitive parenchyma, or, in a later stage of growth, when
the bark is distinctly differentiated into an inner translucent phlosm and an external
phellem layer. These correspondences between the carboniferous Dadozylon and the
| living Salisburia suggests another query. The resemblances between the fossil
Trigonocarpums of the Coal-measures and the fruits of the Gingko have long been
noticed. Do not the facts jus mentioned increase the probability that these Trigono-
earpums are the fruits of Dadozylon? T not only think they do, but these facts
8nggest the further possibility, not to 8ay probability, that our Dadozylons may be
the remote Carboniferous ancestors of the oolitie Baterias—already recognized as the
Q ancestral forms whence sprang the Salisburias of Cretaceous and yet more modern
> times.
= T have again to recognize my obligations to Messrs. Casm, SPENCER, and Bixxs, of
S Halifax; to Mr. Hick, of Harrogate ; to Mr. W1LD, of Ashton-under-Lyne ; and to
5 Messrs. BUTTERWORTH and EARNSHAW, of Oldham, for their valuable aid in searching
© for specimens calculated to aid my investigations.
