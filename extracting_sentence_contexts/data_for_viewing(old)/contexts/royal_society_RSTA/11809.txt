a §$ 6. Determination of the Period.

The method we have followed hitherto has enabled us to express the displacements
a any point of the body by means of two arbitrary constants 0,, 0,, but the
antity \, whose value it is our chief object to determine, has entirely disappeared.
e have, in fact, verified that: the equations (7), (8), and the boundary conditions (9)

a@proximate value of A. We require now to have recourse to .a method which will
@iable us to carry our approximations to the value of \ further.
By using the well-known equations of motion of a body of changing form Professor
oopwARD* has shown that the determination of the period may be reduced to the
@aluation of the disturbing angular velocities due to the flow of the material
i to the principal axes of the body. As we have now expressed the
placements, and consequently the velocities, at any point in terms of 4, ,
Bhich may be taken as the displacements of the body as a whole, we are in a
sition to calculate these disturbing angular velocities. We might then introduce
their values in Professor Woopwarp’s equations and proceed to the determination
& the period by his method. We propose, however, to make use of equivalent
