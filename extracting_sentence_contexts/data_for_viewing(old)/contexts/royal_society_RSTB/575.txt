AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE FOSSIL REPTLLIA. 217

The same author soon after published his ‘ Paleontology,’ which gives in the second
edition, in 1861, a summary of his researches on the Anomodontia,* with some new
facts and new views. Thus, it is observed of the Dicynodontia: ‘ The vertebrae, by the
hollowness of the co-adapted articular surfaces, indicate these Reptiles to have been
good swimmers, and probably to have habitually existed in water; but the construc-
tion of the bony passages of the nostrils proves that they must have come to the
surface to breathe air. The pelvis consists of a sacrum composed of five confluent
vertebrae, with very broad iliac bones, and thick and strong ischial and pubic bones.
The bones of the limbs resemble those of the marine Chelonia, but ave more expanded
at the extremities.” The par-occipital in Ptychognathus is said to have been connate
with the ex-occipital, as in Crocodiles.t A similar observation had been made con-
cerning the skull of Dicynodon tigriceps.t The bone in D. lacerticeps which was
named par-occipital in the explanation of the plate was described as wedged between
the basi-sphenoid and the quadrate. That bone I propose to interpret as the malleus.
In ‘Paleontology’§ a new family, named Cynodontia, is founded for the genera
