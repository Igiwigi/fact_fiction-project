BI-HARMONIC ANALYSIS IN A PERFORATED STRIP. 217

The last row in this table shows the shear on the boundary at the mid-section, which
should be zero, and gives an idea of the magnitude of the residual stresses neglected.
Tn the face of this, close agreement with the exact values cannot be expected. In fact,
as fig. 7 shows, the errors increase rapidly after 4 = 0-2, until for 4 = 0-5 the actual

dotted curves show the values given by the approximate solution.

maximum shear is almost three times that given by the approximate solution. Part
of this discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only
allows for a fraction of the shear across the diminished section. The whole shear across
the section « = 0 is given by
