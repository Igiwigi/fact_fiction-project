Sometimes when it is deeply immersed in the endosperm its growth is
equal in all directions, and thus no tube, but merely an enlarged cell, is produced
(fig. 38n). * When a tube is formed, the free nuclei and cytoplasm move into it
in precisely the same way as in the normal embryo-sac-tubeâ€”it is, in fact, an embryo-
sac-tube remarkable only for its deep-seated origin. In some cones almost every ovule
shows one or more of these abnormally situated tubes; in others they occur in very
few. The endosperm-cells lying near them are frequently bi-nucleate, probably as a
result of amitotic division.
