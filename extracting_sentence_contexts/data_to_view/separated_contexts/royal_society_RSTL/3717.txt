But to heighten the
effect of this the grains of sand are added, thus forming adventitious otolithes, which,
moving freely in the fluid contents of the sac, would considerably increase the vibra-
tion of that fluid. But it is probable that the nerves are also more powerfully affected by the imme-
diate contact of the stony particles themselves, since if they were only added for the
purpose of multiplying the vibration, these would till have been rendered appre-
ciable by the simple expansion of the plexus around the sac, without the necessity for
a more complex apparatus. But the fact that the ciliated processes are always
arranged upon that part of the surface of the sac which in the usual position of the
animal would he lowest, 80 that the stones would by gravitation be constantly in
contact with or near to them, seems to point to the immediate contact of these two
parts as a condition essential to the performance of the functions of the organ. Thus
the least vibration in the fluid wonld throw one or more of the particles into contact
with one or more ciliated processes. And in consideration of the number of these
particles and the readiness with which they would move in the fluid, and further of the
extent of the ciliated surface and the delicate and abundant pubescence with which
each process is clothed, it would seem hardly possible that the slightest vibration
could occur in that fluid without throwing a particle of sand into contact with one of
the processes, and thus causing the vibration to be conveyed to the nerve at its base.
