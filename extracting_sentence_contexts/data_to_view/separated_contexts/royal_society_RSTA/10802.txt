For these we have a definite position « of maximum brightness, and definite
resultant velocity v. We have to integrate for the different lengths of train. Now Tarr* has shown that, of all atoms moving with velocity v, a fraction e~*
penetrates unchecked to distance p, where

= 2 (1 ie eet [ iv’ )
f=4ane . fact + ae T on he id

ow 2,

We may write this function of v as follows :—

Pp
»—F2 / 1
= mins [< + | pa 2) a rp
- 7 | P _ \ pa 4+ Ir ¢

where P = vii,
e? ft r

SN so 2) [ e™
AP) =p + (ga + 2) | eae,
ec = wns’,
n = number of atoms in unit volume,

s = diameter of atom. From this we see that, of molecules moving with velocity v, a fraction
fe-"dp
have free paths between p and p + dp. Now, such a molecule will emit an undisturbed train of waves of length between

rand r + dr, where 7 = —P and V is the velocity of light.
= wr
Hence, of all molecules moving with velocity v, a fraction fe Y dr, will give free
paths between 7 and 7» + dr.
