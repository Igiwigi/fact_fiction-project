biomedical engineering With the aim of clinical applications of X-ray

phase imaging based on Talbot-Lau-type grating

Keywords: interferometry to joint diseases and breast cancer,
grating interferometry, phase contrast, machines employing a conventional X-ray generator
X-ray, clinics have been developed and installed in hospitals.

The machine operation especially for diagnosing

rheumatoid arthritis is described, which relies on the

fact that cartilage in finger joints can be depicted with

Atsushi Momose a dose of several milligray. The palm of a volunteer
