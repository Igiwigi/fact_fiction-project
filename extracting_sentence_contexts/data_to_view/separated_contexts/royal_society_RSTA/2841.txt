78 and 76, yet the eutectic line in
the diagram is drawn only to the point F, corresponding to a concentration of 78°3
per cent. of aluminium. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that although alloys cooled with
moderate rapidity exhibit a eutectic heat evolution to a considerable distance to the
right of the point F, yet both microscopically and pyrometrically this eutectic can
be made to disappear entirely by exposing the alloys to a temperature of about
430° C. for a considerable period of time. In order to establish this point, ingots of a series of alloys lying on either side of
the point F were maintained for about 100 hours at a temperature near 430° C., and
cooling-curves of these ingots were subsequently taken at a rate similar to that
described for the series of curves illustrated in figs. 1 and 2, the observations being
taken from a temperature of 430° C. to about 200° C.
