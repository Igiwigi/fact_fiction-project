No. 14 is a cylinder of lead, 2:06 inches in diameter, and 4 inches long ;
tapped with the screw-hole on its flat side, and supported by the same iron
wire and knife edge as aboye mentioned. It should here be remarked, how-
ever, that this cylinder was not wholly of lead ; since it was formed of a thin
brass: tube filled with lead : and this tube was made to slide into an outer
cylinder of brass, having the dimensions above described, as will be more
fully explained in the next article. The specific gravity of the whole I found
to be 10'237 ; and it weighed 34500 grains.

No. 15, 16, 17, 18 are cylindrical tubes of brass, 2:06 inches in diameter
on the outside, 4 inches long, and 0-13 inch thick. These, however, are not,
different tubes, but consist of one and the same cylindrical outer piece ; and
is in fact the tube into which the leaden cylinder is made to slide, as men-
tioned in the preceding article. This cylindrical outer piece is capable of
being varied in the four following ways, by means of an inner sliding tube.
No. 15 is when both the ends are open, with the exception of a narrow cross
piece at the top, to which the screw is attached. No. 16 is when the top is
$till left open, but the bottom closed. No. 17 is when the top is closed, and
the bottom left open. And No. 18 is when both ends are closed. In all the
cases, the tube was suspended by the same kind of iron wire as that already
described ; and from the same knife edge. The specific gravity of the metal
I found to be 8:453: but here it may be proper to remark (what I shall again
adyert to, in the sequel,) that when a kollow body is swung as a pendulum, we
must take into account the quantity of air contained within the moying body
(which, in the present case, is computed to be 3050 grains,) and diminish the
