Changing @ into « + o, and subtracting, we see that x, («| «) satisfies the difference
4 equation characteristic of 8,’ (a|), so that it can only differ from this function by a
constant, which will vanish, as we see by making a = 0.
We therefore obtain again the relation required.
_ $72. We proceed now to the analogues of Raaze’s formula. This formula may be
written (‘‘ Theory of the Gamma Function,” § 8)

We will evaluate

The method which will be employed is the same as that by which Raase’s formula

itself was originally obtained; it was, in fact, first invented for the proof of the
present theorem.
