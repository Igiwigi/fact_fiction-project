For low temperatures or
small 7, (93) becomes $= 47. (94)

This result shows that at low temperatures the jumps existing in the surface are due essentially
to adsorbed molecules; in fact, the proportion of molecular positions on the surface occupied
by adsorbed molecules is 7 = exp (—2¢/kT) ; as every adsorbed molecule has four horizontal
bonds, the number of these bonds per molecule due to adsorbed molecules turns out to be
equal to (94). In an actual crystal surface there will also be vacant surface sites in number
equal to that of adsorbed molecules, therefore s should be 87*; the reason why (94) is only
half of that is, clearly, the assumption of a two-level model. In fact there will also be on the
crystal surface nuclei of adsorbed molecules and holes consisting of more than one vacant
surface site, but their concentration will be very small at low temperatures.
