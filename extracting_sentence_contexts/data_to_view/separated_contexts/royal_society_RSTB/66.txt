The variation
is not always diphasic; immediately after excision it is more frequently monophasic
and thereafter becomes diphasic. The movement of galvanometer and electrometer
indicates for the monophasic variation negativity predominant either at apex or at
base ; for the diphasic variation (when it is present) negativity of apex, followed by
negativity of base, or the reverse. There is no constant rule, in fact, and we saw no
use in further multiplying observations, seeing that we had to do with the irregulari-
