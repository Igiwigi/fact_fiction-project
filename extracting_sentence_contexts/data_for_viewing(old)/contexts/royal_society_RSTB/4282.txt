wheat, the root-interference effect should be very important.

The rise of the curve in this particular experiment is slightly abnormal, as we had
delayed our irrigation rather too long in early June. We shall see when dealing with
the effects of season that the true daily flowering-curve tends to smooth during its
rise to an approximately straight line. These spacing experiment curves, on the
contrary, all show a slight check during this rise, but this difference from the ideal
form merely decreases the definiteness of our final results, and does not alter them
qualitatively.

The rise is, of course, due to the successive steady increase in the number of later
flowering branches on which flowers are ready to open. This part of the flowering-
curve is, in fact, a reduplication of the growth-curve of the central axis during the
time when the latter was producing the flowering branches.*

* A conception of the branching system of the plant as a kind of scaffolding upon which bud after bud
is formed, each to open as a flower after a well defined time, has been found very useful. It has led to

Comparison of the curves in fig. 2 shows that this rise of the curve comes to an end
later and later with wider spacings. Further, whereas the curve of 1) ceases to rise
in the week ending on July 12, that of 1a—which represents a spacing of half
the 1b density—does not stop until the following week. Thus, the date at which
