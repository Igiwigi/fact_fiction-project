or quite the same as that of those from Regbania; and the least
atom of them immediately evinces its nature, on being heated,
by the strong electricity it acquires. On their solution in acids,
they leave quartz.

OBSERVATIONS.

Chemistry is yet 's0 new a science, what we know of it bears
80 small a proportion to what we. are ignorant of, our know-
ledge in every department of it is s0 incomplete, s0 broken,
consisting s0 entirely of isolated points thinly scattered like
lucid specks on a vast field of darkness, that no researches can
be undertaken without producing some facts, leading to some
consequences, which extend beyond the boundaries of their im-
mediate object,

1. The foregoing experiments throw light on the proportions
in which its elements exist in vitriol of zinc. 23.0 grs. of the
Mendip Hill calamine, produced 29.8 grs, of arid vitriol of zinc.
These 29.0 grs. of calamine contained ' 14.9 grs. of calx of
zinc; hence, this metallic salt, in an arid state, consists of exactly
equal parts of calx of zinc and vitriolic acid.

This inference is corroborated. by‚Äù the results of the other
experiments : 68.0 grs. of the Bleyberg calamine, containing
