The identities of the nucleotides inserted during the gen-
eration process are well described by a dinucleotide Markov
model (electronic supplementary material, figures S9-S11). As was observed for T-cell receptors [5], the profile for the
VD insertions on the sense strand correlates very well with
the JD insertions on the antisense strand. Although the deletion profiles are in fact gene dependent,
and we infer a separate deletion profile for each gene (elec-
tronic supplementary material, figure S8), for convenience
we present here only the weighted mean over all genes of
the V and J gene deletion distributions (figure 3c,d). These
distributions seem little affected by selection, as evidenced
by the similarity between the pre- and post-selection (naive)
distributions.

(b) Selection

Armed with the raw recombination model Ppre, we can esti-
mate the effect of selection in the naive repertoire by
comparing the statistics of the naive, productive sequences,
with those predicted by the generation model. The effect of
selection is already evident from the CDR3 length distri-
bution [16], as illustrated in figure 4.
