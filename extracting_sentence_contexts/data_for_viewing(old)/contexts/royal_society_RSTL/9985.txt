CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IN VERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 935

Gorrscns,* who gave them that appellation without any reference to the part of the
ame name in the Mammalian brain ; but it seems that the other term, tori longi-
tadinales, is more appropriate; the former term seems to indicate a theory ; but
FriTscn, although he uses the latter name, really considers that the bodies in question
homologise with the fornix of the human subject ; this I hope to prove in the end is
not the cage, and thus the term fornix is a misnomer, as having been applied to a
different structure. These objections do not apply to the name tori longitudinales,
which involves no sort of consideration as to theory, but simply states a fact of form.

Tori Semicireulares.

The tecta lobi optici having changed their position, and having been relegated to the
inferior surface of the brain, while the tori semicirculares have retained theirs without
displacement, the relative position of these two parts comes to be that of the egg to
the egg-cup, or, as KOKER puts it, that of an oyster to its shell. The torus semi-
circularis forms a tuberosity of rounded form, bounded below and on the outside by
the tectum. Ib may be divided into two parts, easily distinguishable from each
other, the upper part consisting principally of nerve cells and fibrillee dispersed in a
granular neurogha. The lower part on which it rests contains more nerve fibres, which
belong to the system of the commissura ansulata,
