UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CHEMICAL ACTION. 35

(or V), whereas for high energies, 7.e., further to the right on each diagram, it falls off
very rapidly. Moreover, the shape of the rapidly falling part of the curve is much the
same in each case, and in fact on this part of the curves the ordinates are very nearly
proportional to e~*’, where « is a constant for any one curve. This can be seen if
the logarithms of the ordinates are plotted against V when the points fall very nearly
on a straight line. On the other hand, the slowly varying part of the curve shows
distinct indications of possessing a maximum in fig. 18, whereas in curves I. and II.
it falls away continuously from the initial value. This disagreement at low energies
suggests trouble from the factors referred to above and points to the desirability of
keeping for the present to the high energy part of the curve in trying to find an inter-
pretation of the results. The outstanding feature of this part of the curve is the fact
that it falls away very approximately in proportion to the factor e~*’, which at once
suggests a Maxwell distribution of energy among the electrons, since this distribution
is dominated by a factor of this form. I have therefore calculated the currents which
would be obtained on the assumption that the energy of the electrons is a Maxwell
distribution pertaining to some, as yet undetermined, temperature T, and compared
the results of the calculations with the experimental data.

For a small source surrounded by a large electrode the direction of motion is imma-
terial, and it is only the magnitude of the total kinetic energy which determines whether
the emitted electrons will reach the receiving electrode against a given retarding poten-
tial difference. If the distribution is Maxwellian, the proportion with energies between
u and wu -+-.du is equal to
