in size and weight. By examining a series of sections from organs measuring from
6 inches (15°25 centims.) to 2 feet (61°75 centims.) in length, it was evident, first, that
the increase in size was due to an enlargement of the individual discs, and, second,
that, as the discs increased, the various layers, the nerve layer included, continued to
present the same histological characters as were found in the young fish—that, in fact,
the discs of the Skate were, from a structural point of view, as perfect from first to
last as the corresponding structures in the Torpedo. In the Torpedo, as life advances
the discs gradually increase in diameter but diminish in thickness, while the thickness
of the gelatinous insulating tissue between the discs is considerably augmented.
Practically the same changes take place in the Skate. While the Skate is increasing
from 1 to 7 feet (30°5 to 218 centims.) the organ increases about four times both in
length and in diameter. The increase in length is chiefly due to an increase in the
gelatinous and connective tissues, but in part to an increase of the striated layer.
The increase in diameter is accompanied with an expansion of all the layers of the
disc, and of a corresponding increase of the chamber or loculus and the contained
gelatinous tissue.*
