In Solvent Casting Particulate Leaching (SC/PL), pores are created through the selective

leaching of entrapped particles—such as inorganic salts, gelatin, sugar, sucrose or starch
particles—that act as the porogens, from polymer solutions that have been previously solvent
cast [22]. In this process, parameters such as particle size, initial particle density or polymer
concentration, require attention in order to control pore size, pore connectivity as well as the
mechanical properties of final scaffolds [54,55]. The technique is perfectly adapted to synthetic
(polycaprolactone; PCL [56], poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid; PLGA [57,58], PU [59]) or natural
polymers (gelatin [25], fibroin [60], hyaluronic acid; HA [61]). Also composite-based scaffolds
containing multiple polymers or incorporating biomolecules can be fabricated in order to further
tune the material composition for subsequent cell colonization [62]. One of the characteristics
of SC/PL processing conditions is the need for two solvents during the process. In fact, SC/PL
requires a good solvent for the polymer fraction (that does not dissolve the porogen) and, in a
second step, the use of a solvent that selectively dissolves the porogen while leaving the cast
polymer fraction intact. The use of two solvents of opposing solute affinity dramatically reduces ‘s
the possibility to maintain biocompatible conditions throughout the whole material fabrication
process. As a consequence, the technique is not used for cell encapsulation and only cell
colonization has been described. Moreover, most scaffolds’ thicknesses are limited to 4mm due to
otherwise incomplete leaching of the porogen [63]. Also pore interconnectivity in final scaffolds
can be an issue due to density difference between polymer solutions and porogen particles [64].
To overcome these limitations, centrifugation [59] or solvent self-proliferating processes [65] have
been suggested to improve the SC/PL method, significantly enhancing cell colonization of the
scaffolds. Figure 2 depicts the processing window of the technique, systematically below the
cytocompatibility limit that enables cell encapsulation.
