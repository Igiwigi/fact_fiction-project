Among the genes translationally upregulated under heat stress those residing in operons were
significantly less than the genome-wide operon configuration of E. coli (45% versus 53%,
p=9.36 x 10~Â°). Furthermore, even for the few of them encoded within the same polycistronic
mRNA we did not detect a coordinated expression. This might be not surprising in light of the
fact that translation levels of ORFs within the same polycystronic mRNA largely differ as they
underlie independent initiation [49] and the strength of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence differs
between the ORFs within one operon [50]. Together, this implies that the response to acute heat stress is at least in part shaped by selection
of a subset of genes whose structure up- and downstream of the translation start most likely
undergoes significant melting at higher temperatures. Thus, the initiation regions of these genes
become more accessible upon heat stress, facilitating ribosome binding and, in turn, translation.


(d) Under osmotic upshift cells reallocate translation resources

Exposure of E. coli to high osmolarity causes rapid loss of water (plasmolysis), turgor pressure and
shrinkage of the cell.
