5The approximate formulae (3.4) and (3.5) neglect all higher-order contributions in the Taylor expansion of Sf. For example,
the coefficient in front of the quadratic term is proportional to 3?S% /a?E® =—1/(Ts*C¥), where CB = dE /dTs is the
canonical specific heat of the bath. For this term to vanish individually, CB has to be sufficiently large. Roughly speaking, one
can expect that the second-order as well as higher-order expansion terms become negligible if the Boltzmann temperature TE
changes only slowly when the bath energy is varied. This typically requires a large bath.

°Since system S and bath B can permanently exchange energy, subject to the constraint E7 = ES + E® =const., their
temperatures have to be defined as statistical averages with respect to the microcanonical density operator of the total
system T (see Sec. III.D in [8]).
