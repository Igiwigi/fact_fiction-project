\Sform of the very young strobilus is clearly like that of a sporogonial head ; the
Gifference lies in the simplicity of external surface of the Bryophytiec sporogonium

m during development is very suggestive, and may with propriety be thought
@ a clue to the origin of the more complex structure. The young strobilus has
smooth surface, on which undulating swellings appear, as already noted by
igpisreR and by GorseL. At an early stage, the sporangia may be recognized as
réting at certain points on these outgrowths (compare figs. 1-4, Pl. 42), certain
racial cells, by their segmentation, supplying the essential parts of the sporangia.

an Equisetum, superficial cells provide the essential parts of the sporangia ; but this
- no real difficulty, for, ultimately, the same is the case in many Bryophytes ;
fmphithecium is, in the young state, a series of superficial cells, and it is this
f& which in many cases yields the sporogenous tissue. But, in this connection, the
ence of strict uniformity of origin of the archesporium in the Bryophyta is specially
portant. The gradual appearance of the columella, and relegation of spore-pro-
ction to more superficial tissues is illustrated in the Anthocerotes; if such a
ification were carried but a little further, if the columella were more bulky, and the
finite specialization of archesporia deferred, the result, as regards locality, would
