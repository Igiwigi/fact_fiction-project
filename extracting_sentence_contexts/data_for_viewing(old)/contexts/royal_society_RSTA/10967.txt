old memoir now reappears in two sections. The theory discussed in this paper was, further, the basis of a
paper on the Law of Reversion with special reference to the Inheritance of Coat-colour in Basset Hounds
recently communicated to the Society, and about to appear in the ‘ Proceedings.’t

While I am responsible for the general outlines of the present paper, the rough draft of it was
taken up and carried on in leisure moments by Mr. Lestiz Bramiry-Moorg, Mr. L. N. G. Finon, M.A.,
and Miss ALicr Lex, D.Sc. Mr. BraAMLEy-Moore discovered the w-functions ; Mr. FiLon proved most of
their general properties and the convergency of the series ; I alone am responsible for sections 4, 5, and 6.
Mr. Lestiz BraMiEy-Moore sent me, without proof, on the eve of his departure for the Cape, the
general expansion for z on p. 26. I am responsible for the present proof and its applications. To Dr.

Axice LEE we owe most of the illustrations and the table on p. 17. Thus the work is essentially a
joint memoir in which we have equal part, and the use of the first personal pronoun is due to the fact
that the material had to be put together and thrown into form by one of our number.—K. P.
