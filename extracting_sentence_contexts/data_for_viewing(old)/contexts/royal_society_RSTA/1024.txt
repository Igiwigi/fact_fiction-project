My = (2.19)

=const, V>Vp,

where me and ke are the equilibrium liquidus slope and solute partition coefficient (which can
be obtained from the phase diagram or calculated using CALPHAD), respectively, and k, =
C§/C; is the velocity-dependent partition coefficient. The function (2.19) differs slightly from
the one derived for the approximation of dilute mixtures [17]. For finite concentrations, the
liquidus slope, equation (2.19), depends on the square of the interface velocity, my «(V/Vp)’,
explicitly.! In the theory of diluted mixtures /alloys, the kinetic liquidus was obtained as linearly
proportional to the velocity [17], i.e. my « V/Vp. However, as we show in the following section,
the predictions of the crystal growth kinetics are quantitatively valid using equation (2.19)
and ref. [17] due to the fact that the strongest dependence of m, on V is dictated by the
nonlinear behaviour of the atomic distribution function at the interface k,(V). An estimation
of the pressure influence (with PY,40) on the velocity-dependent kinetic liquidus should
be specially given. On the one hand, the pressure plays an insignificant role in the crystal
growth under usual circumstances (see Chapter 2 in the monograph of Glicksman [39]). On
the other hand, the growth of dendrites might be essentially influenced on the inner core
of the Earth from the magma’s side [37], where the pressure and temperature are important
parameters for dynamical equilibrium at the solid/liquid interface. How important the effect of
viscous pressure relaxation on the rapidly moving solid/liquid interface is should be clarified in
forthcoming works.
