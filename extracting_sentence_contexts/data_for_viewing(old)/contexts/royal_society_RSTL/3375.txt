Still it appears to me exceedingly probable, that in the rational formulze for this
and similar groups of resins exhibiting striking sensible properties, common to all,
we may hereafter find that connexion in constitution which the irrational formula
do not exhibit, and the absence of such connexion js not without its weight in favour
of the opinion, that the resins in general are not mere oxides of a carbo-hydrogen
radical, but are in many cases at least made up of two or more compound radicals.
Into the consideration or development of this yiew, I do not propose to enter, until,
in the sequel of the present and in some subsequent papers, I shall have brought for-

This resin occurs in commerce in the form of tears, generally enveloping small
twigs or thorns of the shrub from which it had exuded. It is largely mixed with
seeds and spines, and sometimes with at least three-fourths of its weight of clay and
other earthy matters. It is of a pale-yellow colour, and is distinguished by its pecu-
liarly hot and acrid taste, and its stimulating action on the organs of smell and eyen
externally upon the skin.

When digested in cold alcohol (0-8) a pale-yellow solution is obtained, which by
evaporation gives a yellow resin. After being treated with cold alcohol as long as
