This shows that a structure such as a line of resonators attached to an elastic beam is
a waveguide. Note that the band gap appears to be similar to that in the case of the string. This
is due to the fact that it is defined by the frequency-dependent inertia (the mass and the added
mass), which is the same for both cases. Qualitatively, this effect is similar to the formation of the stop band that has been observed
in the CN case of an extensible string being used as the master body (see figure 3). The obvious
differences are of course observed due to the different orders of the dispersion equations in these
two cases; the latter includes different asymptotics of 2(K) when K + 0 and when K > oo.

In the case of discretely distributed oscillators, the equation becomes
