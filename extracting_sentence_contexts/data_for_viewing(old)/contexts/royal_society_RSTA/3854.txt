In a similar spirit, it is natural to distinguish eigenmodes of the helicity operator H with 1S
opposite eigenvalues, which may be thought of as representing photons with opposite spin in Dos
the propagation direction. For a mode Ax with eigenvalue +1, we find for the densities (2.9) and : Sg

Note that, for helicity eigenmodes, the densities of energy and helicity are determined by the local
