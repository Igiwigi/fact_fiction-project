On the coast of the Netherlands, also, this inequality seems to offer a
peculiarity ; for it vanishes on the 24th, but increases again without missing a tide. In the northern part of Norway it increases from the 12th, vanishes on the 20th, and
exists but irregularly afterwards. The evidence of these 8tatements is 8een most clearly by an inspection of the curves
of which I have spoken ; and the eye catches from these the course of the facts far
more distinctly than from any numbers. But it is not necessary to publish all these
curves, and I have therefore only annexed a specimen in Plate XXVIL. and, for the
rest, stated the results of them in numbers in Table XI.
