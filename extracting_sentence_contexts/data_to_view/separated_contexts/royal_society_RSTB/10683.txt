In mammalian cells, INO80 recruitment to replication and the finding that INO80 promotes the replication of late
forks is mediated by ubiquitinylated H2A and the BRCA1- heterochromatic domains in a normal S-phase in vivo [57].

INO80 complex physically interacts with the replication [68,69], the complex could exhibit the same function ahead

What role does INO80 play at the replisome? Yeast cells of stalled replication forks [60], and by the observation that
