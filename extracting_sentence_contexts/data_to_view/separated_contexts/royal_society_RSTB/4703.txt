So far as the distribution of the xylem is concerned, a section such as that shown in
Kidston and Lang’s fig. 52, Plate 7,{ bears a close comparison with text-fig. 2 6 of the
present paper. As these authors point out, the mesarch protoxylem of T'mesipteris
finds its counterpart in Asteroxylon, and the same feature has been demonstrated by
Sinnott§ in some species of Lycopodium. The resemblance is increased by the fact,
now demonstrated, that in the genus T'mesipteris the stele of the aerial stem is not
ectophloic, as generally described, but that phloem also occurs laterally and centri-
petally to the bundles of the ring. The lateral phloems would correspond to the
phloem which occupies the bays between the xylem salients of Asterorylon and
Lycopodium. The facts before us appear fully to warrant the suggestion that the scattered medullary
