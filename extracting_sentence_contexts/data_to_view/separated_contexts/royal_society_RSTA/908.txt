These facts help to characterize local states of entangled systems without using reduced density
matrices. They follow from quantum theory: locality is a property of interactions. The other two
facts define the role and the relation of the quantum states of individual and composite systems in
a way that does not invoke density matrices (to which we are not entitled in the absence of Born’s
Rule). Thus, phase shift ug ® 1e = (| Tt | + | LL |) @ Ie acting on a pure pre-decoherence
state matters: measurement can reveal g. In accord with facts 1 and 2, ug changes a| t) + A] |) into
a|t) +e” B| |).
