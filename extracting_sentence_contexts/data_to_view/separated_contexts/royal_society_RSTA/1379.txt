The outcomes of these two different
choices of iteration were the same. From the same figure, it can be noted that the TBRmax value
keeps increasing iteration after iteration and the algorithms do not reach a plateau within 10 full
iterations. This is consistent with all the patients, and is due to the fact that the analysis is based
on the voxel with the maximum value. The visual comparison in figure 5, for three patients, shows how HKEM is able to provide
well-defined lesions in the aneurysm compared to the other two algorithms. KEM also shows
improved definition and higher contrast over OSEM+G.
