(3) The axonic end-ramifications
occur at various levels in the musculature. Nevertheless, such observations as I have been able to make indicate that in cells of
this type one process, presumably the axone, passes out into the musculature, whilst
the other dendritic processes terminate in relation to nerve cells, generally in ganglia
of the myenteric or more rarely in those of the sub-mucous plexus, and this, I believe,
holds true also in the case of the bipolar cells, and probably for the unipolar cells as
well. These observations, taken in conjunction with the fact (vide p. 366) that the
extrinsic vagal fibres end in relation to these cells, render it probable that they represent
the motor cells of the enteric plexuses and are not sensory, as Docten suggested. (ii) Bipolar Cells (figs. 12 and 13, Plate 28).
