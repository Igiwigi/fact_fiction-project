As a consequence of the linearity of q(L), the solution
q'(L) is, in turn, a linear function of L. A few considerations have to be made about the solvability of the system (3.9). In fact, it is easy
to show that the matrix Zo'K(P) Zo is always singular, regardless of the specific lattice structure
under consideration. This is proved by considering a vector q* =t defining a pure rigid-body
translation and observing that K(P) Zo t =0, which, in turn, implies that the dimension of the
nullspace of Zo'K(P) Zo is at least 2, as two linearly independent rigid-body translations exist for
a two-dimensional lattice. Any other deformation mode, possibly contained in ker(Zo'K(P) Zo),
is therefore a zero-energy mode, called ‘floppy mode’ [37,38].
