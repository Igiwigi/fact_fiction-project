While the philosopher Carl Hempel saw scientific explanation as
a type of argument, Hahn and Tesic stress that arguments typically play a role in dialogue, in
trying to convince others (and perhaps also oneself) of the truth or rightness of some contested
matter. Here, arguments are in the service of the broader goal of persuasion, and factors beyond
the argument itself (such as who was its source) are crucial. But explanations can often apply
when there is no issue of doubt about the point to be explained: thus, facts ranging from, say, the
blueness of the sky or that a piece of kitchen cheese has been nibbled, may not be in doubt, but still
may stand in need of explanation. A crucial issue here is what makes an explanation satisfyingâ€”
what distinguishes chains of reasoning to a particular conclusion that provides a sense of insight
and understanding. Hahn & Tesic provide a review of the state-of-the-art in psychological and
atificial intelligence approaches to both argument and explanation, and point the way for future
research.
