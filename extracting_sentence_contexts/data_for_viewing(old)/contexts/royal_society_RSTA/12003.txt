and it is interesting to enquire whether, assuming the coefticients of V,, arbitrarily,
it is possible to pass to a corresponding redundant generating function.

I find that the coefficients of V,, must satisfy

2—nWtn—2

conditions, and, assuming the satisfaction of these conditions, a redundant form can

be constructed which involves
nuw—1

undetermined quantities. In fact, when a redundant form exists at all, it is
necessarily of a (7 — 1)-tuply infinite character.

We are now able to pass from any particular redundant generating function to an
equivalent generating function which involves n—1 undetermined quantities.
Assuming these quantities at pleasure, we obtain a number of different algebraic
products, each of which may have its own meaning in arithmetic, and thus the number
of arithmetical correspondences obtainable is subject to no finite limit.

This portion of the theory is given at length in the paper, with illustrative examples.

Incidentally interesting results are obtained in the fields of special and general
determinant theory. The special determinant, which presents itself for examination,
