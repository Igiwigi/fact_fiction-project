Value of y*, 27-8. Value of y*, 13-5.

It is clear from Table II that considerable differences exist between cages which
were kept at the same humidity. It is well to measure the degree of inconsistency,
to discover whether it is so great as to imply that the population was heterogeneous.


ON CLIMATE AND TSETSE FLIES 183

The degree of inconsistency between cages at a single humidity may be appropriately
measured by z? ; we propose to test the hypothesis that the flies in all the cages at
one humidity were drawn from a homogeneous population. The x? formula gives
a measure of the divergence between the ‘“ observed” facts and what would be
“expected ”? on this hypothesis. An example will make this clearer. Taking the
figures for 88°, humidity, the number of deaths expected in each cage on the first
day is 3-4. But in successive cages the deaths observed were 9, 6, 1, etc. Let suc-
cessive values of x be 9 — 3-4, 6 — 3-4, etc., and let the expected number of deaths
(3-4) be m. Successive values of x*/m are then calculated for the ten cages ; the
sum of these values is y?. It is clear that if the separate cages give results which are
consistent with one another, and therefore close to the mean, the value of 7? will be
low. In the present example the value of x? is 27-8, the number of “ degrees of
freedom” being nine. Reference to a table (FisHER, 1932) shows that so high a
value of y* would occur less than once in a hundred, if the flies had been drawn
from a homogeneous population. The value of x? for the experiments at 65°,
humidity is 13-5, and this also indicates heterogeneity.
