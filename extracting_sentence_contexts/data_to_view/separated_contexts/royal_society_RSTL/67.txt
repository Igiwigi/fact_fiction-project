with all the Caution imaginable. Now ſince fo ſmall
an Inequality is the Matter of fact, between Bodies of
the ſame Species weigh'd in Water, whoſe Diſproporti-
ons of Surtaces are, as x t0'255, (for I reckon the Sides
of all the Tincel Bodics to be equal to.the Sides of the
| ſingle Braſs piece,) I muſt conclude, 'Thar thoſe Bodies
<mult be infinitely ſmall, whoſe inequality of their Surta-
=ces to their Bulks does exceed thoſe in this Experiment :
'ZFor ſuppoſing one of theſe thin Squares ſhould be
wrought into the form of a Globe, I am very apt to
Zhink, That.the Diſproportion then of irs Surface to its
ppalk of Matter, would not be ſo great as its Preſent
Jorm renders it. Z Moreover, That altho the Diſproportions-of the Sur-
Faces of Bodies, to their bulk of Matter be very great ;
et, that that is the only Reaſon why a Metalick, Body
ould be ſuſpended in a Mexſtraum ſpecifically lighter
