The gaseous nebule, given in the Table in Frost's edition of Scuerner’s ‘ Spectro-
scopy,’ have been distributed into the same equal areas as the stars,

The following shows the relative distribution for the nebule and for the stars :—

A. B; @: Db
Gaseous nebule . . . . 3 7 16 6
Stars of Division I. . . . 3 6 17 3.

Thus it appears that the helium stars of Division I. and the gaseous nebulw are
subject to a similar law of distribution in relation to the galactic plane.

All these facts afford grounds for accepting the conclusion that the helium stars of
Subdivision I. («) are in the first stage of stellar development from the gaseous nebulie.

Division I. has a second subdivision, viz., I. (b), which is also characterised by a few

special lines. These lines have been attributed to calcium, barium, and magnesium.
Since these special lines persist through the subsequent divisions, it may be concluded
with tolerable certainty, that in order of development Subdivision I. ()) follows after
Subdivision I, (a). The K line of calcium, which first appears in this subdivision,
gradually increases in strength to such a marked extent in the subsequent divisions,
that it may be practically taken (as suggested by Dr. Huaerns), as a criterion of the
type to which a spectrum belongs. Two bright line spectra have been treated as
belonging respectively to the divisions to which their absorption spectra belong.
