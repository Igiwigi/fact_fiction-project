differences are to be found when different parts of the fovea are stimulated.

Visual acuity using blue light. Experiments will be described in Part VIII, in which the
visual acuity of the eye was determined using red, green, blue and white lights. It was found
that acuity for blue was equal to that by other lights, within the experimental error of the
method. But it would be very unlikely that this would be the case if the foveal centre were
blue-blind, because this part of the retina is known to have the highest acuity, and that a
departure from this point invariably causes a serious fall in the ability to observe fine
detail.

The position so far as Willmerâ€™s hypothesis is concerned may be summarized as follows:
If the fovea is indeed colour-blind, it would be expected that one or more of the above tests
would have disclosed the fact; but it has been shown that they do not do so.

(75) The contrast hypothesis

It is well known that simultaneous contrast is a phenomenon which occurs chiefly at the
contours which separate one surface from another. If then the colour losses described in
Parts II, III and IV were due to a phenomenon resembling contrast, it would be expected
that the following conditions would favour colour loss:

(1) The splitting up of a test object into several small parts.

(2) Increasing the length of contour separating the test object from its background.
