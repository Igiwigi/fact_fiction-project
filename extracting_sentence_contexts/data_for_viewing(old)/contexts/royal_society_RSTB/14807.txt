population with mean phenotype x* will resist invasion by and even the number of loci. At the time, this independence

mutants with alternative phenotypes but populations with was important for supporting the use of ESS analysis across


a broad range of species with different genetics and demogra-
phy. However, this independence may no longer be as useful
given the growing abundance of genomic, transcriptomic and
long-term demographic data for natural populations. Instead,
we might rather want to make use of these data to refine
our evolutionary models, and the ESS may be a less useful
approach if it cannot take advantage of these data. However,
long-term evolution and consequently ESSs are in fact sensi-
tive to genetics and demography for many traits and
populations more complex than Result 4.1 assumes. The
threshold for such complexity can be quite low as in the case
of sex ratio evolution where details of the genetic system can
be crucial [121,125,193,194], in the case of kin and group struc-
tured populations where demography determines the fate of
genes with social effects, and in the case of recombination,
mutation and migration rate evolution in variable environ-
ments where the ES rates depend on the recombination rate
between the major and modifier loci.

All of the ESS analysis so far has concerned a single pheno-
