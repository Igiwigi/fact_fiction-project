yet Lwas sure I $hould find it at the bottom of the bottle, if
not in visible drops of water, yet in that kind of cloudy cover-
ing which cold glass acquires from a contact with hot steam
or watery Vapour.

But if the particles of air, instead of communicating their
heat from one to another, from the centre to the surface of the
bottle, each in its turn, and for itself, came to the surface of
the bottle, and there deposited its heat, and its water, I con-
cluded that the cloudiness occasioned by this deposit of water
would appear all over the bottle, or, at least, not more of it
at the bottom than at the sides, but rather less; and this I
found to be the case in fact.

The cloudiness first made its appearance upon the sides of
the bottle, near the top of it; and from thence it gradually

lower, it was hardly visible at the distance of half an inch from
the bottom of the bottle ; and upon the bottom itself, which
was nearly flat, there was: scarcely the smallest appearance of
cloudiness.

These appearances, I think, are easy to be accounted for. The
