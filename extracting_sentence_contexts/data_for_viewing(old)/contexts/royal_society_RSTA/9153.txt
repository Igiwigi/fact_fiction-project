The agreement between theory and experiment, as shown in Table VIL, is, on the
whole, very close.

The experimentally observed energy relations, however, are not sufficiently accurate
to enable us to determine with certainty the exact process by which the original
configuration of the atom is regained.

In fundamentals, however, the theory can scarcely be questioned. It explains so
many facts and is so simple in itself that there seems no alternative but to accept it
in outline at least.

[The principal facts which may be regarded as giving support to the theory may be summarised as
follows :—
(1) When » is just less than yx for any one of the heavier elements, the fraction of the primary energy

absorbed (K absorption) transformed into K characteristic radiation (E) is slightly less than 0°5.
K,

(2) There is evidently a limiting value of about 0°5 for the fraction.

(3) As » diminishes this fraction invariably diminishes.

(4) In the one substance carefully investigated—a substance giving the maximum value just below 0:5—
the rate of diminution of this fraction with diminution in p is almost perfectly that given by theory.
