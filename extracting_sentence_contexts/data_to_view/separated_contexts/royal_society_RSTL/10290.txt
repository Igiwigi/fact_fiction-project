Agrostis
mulgaris, however, contributed a much higher proportion of the produce on these plots
(excepting 14) of high gramineous luxuriance, and maturation also, than did Festuca
ovind. A The general result is, that Festuca oving has gained in prominence on all the
AMeficiently or only moderately manured plots; and it has done 80 the most, other
Ahings being equal, where, with a sufticiency of nitrogenous manure favouring grami-
neous luxuriance, there has been a deficiency of mineral supply preventing matura-
ion, and consequently limiting the power of competition, of the freer-growing grasses. Sn fact, where the Festuca oving has yielded the highest percentage of the produce, it
Has been with low total yield, and with a very large proportion of dark green, leafy,
5 mature growth. The Festnca ovind also gains where other plants suffer for want of
:Mnoisture ; whilst the Agrostts vulgaris gains (if the other conditions are favourable to
"St) in the wetter seasons. D HLestuca pratensts.
