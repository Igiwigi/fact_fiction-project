This rise affects Quercus,
Ulmus, Tilia, Pinus, and perhaps Corylus. It is difficult in this diagram to say where the boundary should be set between
zones VII and VII-VIII, but at 75 cm. it will be seen that Betula begins to rise, Ulmus
exceeds Tilia, Fagus increases in amount, and there is some suggestion of a Pinus
maximum. The probability that this is the onset of zone VII-VIII is supported by the
fact that the peat there shows a change to a drier character. A clear view of the stratigraphy of the peat beds at this site emerges from an examina-
tion by Dr M. H.
