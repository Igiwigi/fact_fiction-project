Over the past century, some confusion

the literature, most commonly the volume and
surface entropies introduced by Gibbs. It can be
proved, however, that only the volume entropy
satisfies exactly the traditional form of the laws of
thermodynamics for a broad class of physical systems,
including all standard classical Hamiltonian systems,
regardless of their size. This mathematically rigorous
fact implies that negative ‘absolute’ temperatures and
Carnot efficiencies more than 1 are not achievable
within a standard thermodynamical framework. As an important offspring of microcanonical
thermostatistics, we shall briefly consider the
