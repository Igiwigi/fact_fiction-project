Such enquiries not being fitted for them, or being too much

stances too much praise cannot be bestowed on the few indivi-
duals, whose zeal for science induces them to exert themselves
in improving this branch of knowledge; to one of these, Mr.
SCoRESBY, jun, I am indebted for the means of making the
following ebservations on the tusks of the narwhale.

Mr. ScortsBY told me, a year ago, that the female nar-
whale had no tusks, which astonished me; and the only reply
I could make to such an assertion, was to beg that he would
procure me a skull, that I might be satisfied of the fact. This
he promised to do, and last suwmmer sent me the skull
of a female, in which there was no appearance whatever of
tusks; and as the sutures were all united, there was every
reason to believe the time of having teeth had elapsed, parti-
cularly as a male $kull of the same size, and in which the
sutures were not equally well united, had a tusk four feet
