We do not, in this paper, intend to say anything about the scientific and technical feasibility
of smaller tokamak reactors. Also, smaller machines may not be the best solution in terms of
efficiency. But if feasible, they do offer the possibility of crossing the valley of death at a lower
financial risk level. And they do offer, crucially, the possibility of an innovation cycle which is
compatible with fast exponential growth.

8. Concluding remark

There are economical constraints to the speed at which fusion power can be deployed. These
derive from the large unit size, large overnight investment cost and long construction time, which
preclude an effective innovation cycle, and the fact that the valley of death must be crossed at
an unprecedented level of investment. All of these constraints could be significantly softened


if—through technological advances or new design concept—the DEMO reactor can be smaller Lo |
simpler and cheaper. This could potentially bring the introduction of fusion power forward by

decades. S

Realizing that the primary economic challenge of fusion—after DEMO has given the proof of : =
concept—will be the market introduction, i.e. crossing the valley of death, we find that it is much : gS
more sensible to direct the design efforts at producing a Gen1 fusion plant that is cheap and fast 12
