Recall from §2 the discussion of circles contained in the spectrum of Co-semigroups. This
discussion implies in particular that the well-known alternative—either ||Zo(t)|| =1 for all t>0
or (Zp(t)):=0 is exponentially stable—holds here in a much stronger form: either (Jo(t));>0 is
exponentially stable or T € o (7o(t)) for almost every t > 0. Thus, unless (7o());>9 is exponentially
stable, its peripheral spectrum (in fact, even the peripheral essential spectrum) is as large as
possible for almost all values of t. In order to link the study of (Zo(t));>0 with the results from the preceding sections, define the
quadratic operator pencil P(z):= 242B+A,z€C, with D(P(z)) = D(A). The next statement in
combination with the abstract decay criteria from §3 tells us that semi-uniform decay rates for the
energy E can be rewritten as operator norm estimates for P(z)! with z € iR; see [97, Lemma 4.6].
