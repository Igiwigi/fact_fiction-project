Further, it may be remembered+, that s0. far from the
contents of the yelk being in a dormant condition at the time of oviposition, as some
inquirers have supposed4, there are changes still going on within it, and which are
perceptible to the eye, in the condition of the white surface, for ten or twelve minutes
after oviposition ; after which they become less and less marked, and s0on entirely
cease if the egg be not fecundated. Thus then from a comparison of the state of the fecundatory agent with the body
to be fecundated, we might have expected to have found some close coincidence in
the retention of their vitality, and this indeed, in a state of nature, seems to be the fact. Spawning seldom or never takes place by the act of the species until each sex has
attained its full maturity of function. The eggs are sometimes voluntarily retained
by the female Frog, for several hours or days within the uteri, although arrived at
maturity, if the proper evolution of spermatozoa in the male be not completed.
