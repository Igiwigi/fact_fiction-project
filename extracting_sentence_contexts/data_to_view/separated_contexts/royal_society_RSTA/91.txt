This effect may be explained on the basis of the range-
velocity relation for heavy ions derived by Bohr (1941) ; this shows that the specific ionization
decreases with decreasing velocity over the greater part of the trajectory before rising to
a sharp maximum at very low velocities. This maximum, however, is concentrated within
a very short distance, of the order of the mean diameter of the grains in a photographic plate,
and its effect is therefore not normally evident in the Ilford plates. The general decrease of
specific ionization with decreasing velocity does, on the other hand, account for the fact
that, in strongly desensitized plates, the latter parts of the fragment tracks are not recorded,
since the density of ionization is insufficient to render the grains developable. The observed
mean range under these conditions is, therefore, less than the true mean range of the fragments. 3.
