The analogy of other Rhizopods,
however, would lead us to suppose that the sarcode projects from the marginal pores
under the form of pseudopodta, and that it is by the introduction of alimentary parti-
cles (chiefly minute forms of vegetation) through their means into the mass of sarcode
from which they are put forth, that the fleshy body pervading the entire disk is
nourished. For although there is nothing likea digestive cavity in any part of it, oran
Jalimentary tube passing from one portion to another, still less any vascular commu-
Dhication between the segments, yet as the sarcode forms one soft homogeneous mass
ontinuous throughout, the body as a whole will receive the benefit of any incorpora-
"ion of new matter with its substance, in whatever situation this may be made. That
Drganic particles small enough to pass through the marginal pores, are thus introduced
Jpto the chambers of the disk, is proved by the curious fact, that the residuum left
after the decalcification of large and therefore aged disks, whose animal contents have
-Not been preserved, consists almost entirely of an asemblage of remains of minute
Diatomacece, Desmidiec, &c., which have obviously been retained in the interior of
Abeir cavities, after the assimilation of the nutriment they were competent to afford. BS 35, The sarcode-body of the animal, growing at the expense of the nutriment thus
Appropriated, will gradually, it is probable, project itself through the marginal
Srifices, not merely in filamentous psendopodia, but in quantity sufficient to form new
Segments on the outside of each pore; and these segments, extending themselves
Zaterally, will come into mutual connexion, and will thus form a complete annulus. At may be presumed to be by the calcification of the surface of this beaded ring of
Sarcode, that the formation of the shelly zone is accomplished ; and if the calcifying
rocess commence on the segments, and extend from these along the surface of their
Fonnecting stolons, we can understand why the passages that are left for communi-
Sation with the exterior, should arise from the intermediate divisions of the annular
Fanal, instead of from the segments themselves.
