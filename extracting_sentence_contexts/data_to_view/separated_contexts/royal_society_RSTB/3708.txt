Polytes 2s alone. The problem of the various forms of female in P. polytes may therefore be divided
into two distinct portions, the first being that which deals with the relations between
the cyrus form and the mimetic forms, and the second dealing with the difference
between the romulus 2 and the polytes Â¢ , which, superficially at all events, does not
affect the first part of the problem,

The Relationship between the eyrus 3 and the Mimetic Forms. Mention has already been made of the fact that there is only one form of ? in
P. polytes, though, as has been pointed out by Prof. Ponnerr,* considerable
variation is found in the colour and extent of the subterminal series of spots on the
underside of the hind wing. The cyius 2 shows a similar variation, though its
range is somewhat different, for the normal female coincides with those males which
have the subterminal spots most developed and most highly coloured ; variations from
the normal in the female usually tend towards an accentuation of these features, and
thus pass further from the normal type of male.
