My strcbilus, the Cala-
mitean character of which it is impossible to doubt, is filled with round spores that
are unmistakably Cryptogamic. The structure of the roots affords clear evidence that
they were not the woody prolongations of the main axis seen in the roots of the Gymno-
spermous Conifers, but adventitious appendages of the Cryptogamic type. All these
facts point to one conclusion, viz. that the Calamites were all Cryptogamic plants, but.
that they possessed a much higher organization than is seen in any of the Cryptogams
living at the present day. Some writers affirm that the living Isoetacee exhibit an
exogenous stem.
