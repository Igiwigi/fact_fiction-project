Dr. WaLkeR
at Mahabuleshwar, at 4500 feet, found the rise from sunrise to 9—10 a.m. to be nearly
identical (0476, thermometer +4©18) with my rise at less than 2000 feet. Mr. Dar.-
Manovy at Kotagherry, at 6407 feet, found the rise from sunrise to noon to be 0490,
thermometer +104 ; and had his observations been taken at the hour of the maxi-
mum diurnal tide (9—10 a.m.), the oscillation would no doubt have exceeded those
recorded by Dr. WaLkeR and myself at infinitely lower levels. Mr. GoLpinNGnam at
the Observatory at Madras, a little above the level of the sea, makes this tide amount
to *0470 ; 80 that, in fact, it is less at the level of the sea than at 6407 feet ! The nocturnal rising tide from 4—5 ».y. to 10—11 e.. I observed with great care
for eleven months continuously in 1830.
