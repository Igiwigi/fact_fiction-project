At low temperatures the partial oxidation was favoured leading to
NOx conversion, whereas at higher temperatures, the octane was completely combusted and
limited the NO, conversion. Interestingly, it was reported that, when using toluene, an increase
in temperature led to an increase in NOx conversion. This was attributed to the fact that toluene
is less easily oxidized compared with octane and, therefore, partial oxidation occurs over a
wider temperature window. Another benefit of the IPC system was a decrease in the rate of
deactivation compared with the thermal system while maintaining good Np selectivity and low
N2O formation. The remarkable enhancement in conversion and Ny selectivity was further investigated using
a combined DRIFTS hybrid plasma system.
