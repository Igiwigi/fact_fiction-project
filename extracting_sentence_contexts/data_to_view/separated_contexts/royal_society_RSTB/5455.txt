As regards the spores, which are here described for the first time, the only
points that call for comment are the considerable range in size they exhibit and the fact
that they are smooth-walled. It is perhaps worth while emphasising in conclusion that, though the attempt to
estimate the bearings of the work has necessarily led to speculation, it is not the latter,
but the addition of data that is of value. The few facts regarding the sporangia, spores
and emergences of Psilophyton princeps, Dawson, that are described in this paper are
not completely understood and their comparative bearings and significance is a matter
of opinion. But, since they are clearly demonstrated by specimens and preparations,
they constitute another of the smal! steps by which our knowledge of the earliest vascular
plants is slowly progressing.
