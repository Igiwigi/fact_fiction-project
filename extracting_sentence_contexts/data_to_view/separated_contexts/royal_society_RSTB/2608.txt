The last of the three explanations is the one which Professor Freon accepts, his
conclusion being : “ According to the morphological investigations, it may be presumed
that Stylophyllopsis branched off from Montlivaltia.”

Setting aside, for the present, the above statement of Frecu’s opinions, I shall
enumerate a few of the observed facts. The species Stylophyllum paradoxum,
FRrcH, is one under which an unusual variety of forms has been included. In fact,
one of the most striking features in almost any species of Stylophyllum is that few
specimens can be said to be really alike ; and that, although the differences may be
slight from one specimen to the next, there are extremes at the two ends, so to
speak, of a specific series, which seem to have little in common. This I take to be
thoroughly natural, if we regard the sub-family as a Triassic assemblage of nearly-
related specivs undergoing differentiation in one direction and another, and fairly
rapidly. Advance and retrogression would act hand in hand in such an assemblage.
