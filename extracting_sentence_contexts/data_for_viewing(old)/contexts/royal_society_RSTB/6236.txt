range from 6 to 14mm of saturation deficiency. At higher temperatures, 37° C is
most unfavourable under all conditions of humidity (p. 184), but here there is
discrepancy between our data and those published by Taytor (19322). It is much
to be desired that studies should be made at about 32°—34° G, partly in relation to
Taytor’s discovery about enhanced parasitism with Trypanosoma, partly because
at the hottest time of the year, the insects are exposed to such temperatures for
comparatively long periods, for the true mean temperature of Gadau for April was
31-72° C (p. 229). It seems that there is a great difference between the effects of
humidity at 30° and at 24° G, for at this lower temperature reproduction can occur
at humidities ranging from 11 to 93%, though more facts would be welcome (p.192).

It is clear, then, that middle humidities are most favourable, at any rate at 30° C
and higher temperatures ; this is true of both species, and of fed and also unfed
flies (p 229). It is not yet possible to give a physiological explanation of this,
but it is evident that the effect of humidity on Glossina is not direct, for none of the
phenomena are proportional to it. It follows that the amount of water lost (which
we believe to be determined by saturation deficiency) may be unfavourable because
it is excessive or because it is too little.

One would naturally suppose that the unfavourable effect of high humidity is due
to the accumulation of water in the insect. This is consistent with what is known
for other insects (see Buxton, 1932, p. 297). The general explanation is that at
