Acetic acid, then, produced such a change in the colourless globules at the
top of the coagulating blood just mentioned, that I believe them to have been of the
sme kind as certain corpuscles usnally floating in the blood : corpuscles paler than
the rest, and termed * colourless globules.”

109. Are any of the colourless globules in the top-stratum of coagulating blood
concerned in producing the buffy coat? App1s0N believes that they © coalesce” to
form it. ©In a few minutes,” says he, © coagulation commenced in streaks and
films, all of which were evidently composed by the aggregation of the globules.” The
optical instrament used by App1soN was merely a CoppinGrox lens: but the employ-
ment of a compound microscope, with very high magnifying powers, has not enabled
me to detect any other substance than the globules he pointed ont, with the contain-
ing fluid, as giving origin to the buffy coat. 'The fact is, that the globules I met
with were no other than parent cells, more or less adyanced in producing young
blood-dises. In the top-stratuimn I met with a number of these young discs, dis-
charged from their cells, very minute and delicate, and scarcely tinged with red. When the top-stratum had coagulated, these cells were no longer found : but in their
Stead I saw fibres, such as those in tisswes, known to have their origin in cells: not
in the cell-membranes, which I find to be of very subordinate importance (par. 90),
bat in the dises contained within the cells.
