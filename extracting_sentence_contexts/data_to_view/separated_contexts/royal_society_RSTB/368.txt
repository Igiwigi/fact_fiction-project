B. POULTON ON THE COLOUR-RELATION BETWEEN EXPOSED

From the above Table it is possible to gain a very correct estimate of the duration of
the stages and of the whole period: Stage III. is seen to be fairly constant in length,
but the others very irregular. The boundaries of the different stages are fixed with
great exactness in nearly all cases, owing to the number of the observations and the
fact that the experiment began about two-and-a-half hours after the larvee were taken
from their food-plant. I think that this Table gives the duration of the different
stages more completely than they can be found in any of the other series. B.
