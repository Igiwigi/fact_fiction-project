I shall refer to these methods as P,;, P,, M, and Fl. In the latter case, not

because Sir W. H. Frower was the first* to use a ratio of stature and long bone for
the mean population for the reconstruction of stature, but because he has emphasised
the fact that, for dwarf races, it does appear to give fairly good results.

My material is very sparse. Sir Grorce Humpury, in his work on “ The Human
Skeleton,” gives (p. 106) the mean long-bone lengths for three presumably male
Bushmen.
