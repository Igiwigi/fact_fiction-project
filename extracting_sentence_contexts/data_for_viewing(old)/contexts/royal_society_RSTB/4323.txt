the persisting sinus-portion of the ectodermal groove. The line of fusion of the ecto-
and ento-branchial ducts is of the nature of an oblique overlap and includes the
region of the closing membrane, but the latter is no longer distinguishable as a distinct
structure, with the result that it is impossible to determine the exact limits of the
ectoderm and entoderm. The evidence indicates, however, that, as in the preceding
stages, the pouch-entoderm is continued asa solid process fused with the ectobranchial
duct right down to the sinus.

For the very short composite segment which thus intervenes between the second
pouch and the sinus-ectoderm, we adopt the designation suggested by Hammar (22)
viz. ductus ecto-entobranchialis IJ. The corresponding structure in the pig (Zorrer-
MAN, 69, p. 527) and guinea-pig (RupEN, 50, p. 591) differs from that of Trichosurus
mainly in the fact that the union of its two constituent parts is not of such a
markedly overlapping character as in Trichosurus, but is more of the nature of an end-
to-end junction.

In Stage VI (embryo of G.L. 7:75 mm.), the walls of the dorso-cranial angle of the
- sinus proper, with which the ductus ecto-entobranchialis is continuous, have become
thickened and fused together to form a solid mass which is the first indication of the
primordium of the cervical thymus (Plate 4, fig. 15, s.tm.). The second pouch has now
the form of a thin cord with only a proximal remnant of its lumen, distally it passes into
continuity with the slightly thickened ductus. In Stage VII, fusion of the thickened
walls of the sinus proper has proceeded still further with the result that only a small
ventral remnant of its lumen now remains. The bulbously swollen mass so formed
constitutes the primordium of the cervical thymus (Plate 3, fig. 16, s.tm.). The swollen
