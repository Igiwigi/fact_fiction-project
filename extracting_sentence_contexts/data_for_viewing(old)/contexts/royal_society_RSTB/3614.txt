The much discussed view, that the Mesozoic family of the Bennettitales indicates
the Cycadean stock from which modern Angiosperms have sprung, has, notwithstand-
ing its great theoretic interest, added nothing to our actual knowledge of the early
history of the true Angiosperms. â€˜This is recognised, even by those who have found
most interest in the Bennettitales (see Scorr, 1911, p. 238). To our ignorance, the
Angiosperms appear to have sprung up with surprising rapidity and to have
conquered the world with astonishing ease. They appear also to have worn much
the same guise as they still present to the world, even in the earliest strata in which
they have been found.

Apart from the fact that forms with foliage of modern aspect were widely
distributed in Cretaceous times, we have remarkably little knowledge of the

in the form of casts of the surface impressions. The systematic botanist is fully
aware of the unsatisfactory nature of such data, and of the almost insurmountable
difficulty of identifying species even of living forms from isolated leaves alone.
In modern systematic work, the flowers and fruits are the criteria of a classi-
