(b) Lattice Boltzmann method for the Poison equation

To simulate the electrokinetic of a flow, the potential and charge distribution should be
determined. The Poisson equation is the partial differential equation. From which, the electrical
field can be derived [18,19,22,23,27]

where W is the electric potential, pz is the volumetric charge density and ¢ is the dielectric constant
of the material. To solve the Poison equation with the LBM, a fictive time-dependent term is added
and the equation becomes

Introducing a parameter x, which depends on the dielectric constant of the material, different
dielectric material can be simulated. The evolution equation for equation (2.8) in a D2Q9 LBM
can be written as
