1. Introduction

Worldwide pollinator populations have declined or entirely disappeared [1-5].
Their demise threatens the pollination of animal-pollinated plant species, an
important ecosystem service that ultimately contributes to food security for
many organisms including humans [6-8]. Pollinator decline is largely attributed
to environmental change owing to human activities, particularly agricultural
intensification and climate change, which result in a severe loss of biodiversity
[6,9-13]. In fact, reduced biodiversity, as found in intensively managed agricul-
tural landscapes, correlates with reduced ecosystem functioning, such as
ecosystem productivity, and therefore biomass and floral resource production
[14-16]. It ultimately results in altered plant community compositions and
can severely affect the abundance, diversity and composition of resources
required by flower-visiting insects for both nutrition (pollen and nectar) and
