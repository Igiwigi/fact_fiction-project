IN THE VENTRICLES OF THE VERTEBRATE HEART. BOD 483

Shape of the right and left ventricular cavities, as shown by casts and transverse sections.

As it is difficult to obtain a correct idea of the shape of the ventricular cavities, a
detailed description of them may prove not unacceptable. The left ventricular cavity in
the fresh heart of the deer, at the extreme base (if the aortic opening is not, included),
is more or less circular in form (Plate XII. fig. 17, b). Half an inch or 8 from the
base (Plate XV. fig. 49, b) it changes from the circular to the oyal, and is lightly in-
creased in size from the fact of the left ventricular cavity tapering from its middle
third towards the base (Plate XII. fig. 17, 65). In this portion of the left ventricular
cavity (Plate XV. fig. 49), the chord tendinew and the segments of the bicuspid valve

— hang loosely,
S Receding from the base to the extent of fully an inch (Plate XV. fig. 50, b), the
2 appearance of the left ventricular cavity again changes—the change in this instance
= being caused by the projection into it of the flattened oblique heads of the papillary
=muscles (a, 7), which convert it from an oval shape into an irregularly triangular one
=(Plate XII. fig. 17, w).
S Proceeding an inch or 80 nearer the apex, the left ventricular cavity (Plate XV.
:Sfig. 91, þ) becomes 8maller and more decidedly triangular, and is, from the prominence
