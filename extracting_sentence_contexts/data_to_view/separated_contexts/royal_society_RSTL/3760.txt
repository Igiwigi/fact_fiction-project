tends to surround the whole disKk with its mouth or growing margin, and thencefor-

117. Looking now to the general organization of the five genera which I have
described, and to the peculiarities by which I have shown that each is characterized,
I think that we are in a position to inquire into the value of the system of classifica-
tion which has been erected by M. p'OrxB1Gxy on the exclusive basis of plan of
growth; on which inquiry, the facts which I have now brought together have an
obvious and direct bearing. I. The very close physiological relationship which has been shown to exist between
Orbitolites and Orbiculina, requires that they should be associated in the same Family,
if not in the sxame Genus.
