per square centim. per hour. It follows, therefore, that the
absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the whole of the under surface of an
assimilating leaf like that of the Catalpa, must proceed at about one-half the rate
which the same absorptive surface of leaf would possess if it were covered with a
constantly renewed film of a solution of caustic alkali: we may say, in fact, that the
coefticient of absorption of the leaf surface under these conditions is about half that
of the surface of the alkaline solution. If, however, we assume that the absorption
of carbon dioxide in the leaf takes place only through the stomatal openings—which
occupy at the outside not more than ‘9 per cent. of this leaf area—we arrive at the
