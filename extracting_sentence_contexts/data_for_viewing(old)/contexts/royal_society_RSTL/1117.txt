Calculation for Carbonic Acid.

100': 8.5 : : 9311 : 281.43.
Consequently 281,43 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were
given off in 55 minutes.

In this experiment we meet with a remarkable fact, viz. that
as much carbonic acid gas was given off in 55 minutes, as in
the former experiment in eleven minutes ; $0 that it appears,
whenever atmospheric air is taken into the lungs, it returns
charged with about 8 per cent. carbonic acid. The faster re-
spiration is performed, the more carbonic acid is given off, and
consequently the more oxygen consumed : in this instance it
was given off at the rate of fifty-one cubic inches per minute.

Thirteenth Experiment.

We now proceeded to carry on the respiration of common
air for a much longer period than usual, and of course on a
