HISTOLOGY OF THE LAND-PLANARITANS OF CEYLON. 125

and other obseryers have called the external tisxwe of the Planarians they have
examined a basement, membrane, and have therefore described longitudinal muscles as
being external in that animalâ€”which no doubt is correct from one point of view, since
it is probably impossible to detect any muscular fibres in the external tissue of the
body; but still it is apt to lead to an erroneous conclusion. The great fact to be borne
in mind is that, whatever this external tunic may be called, it is the homologue of the
external circular muscular coat, of higher worms and Bipalium, and that therefore the
distinction between the arrangements of the muscular system in the two groups is of
very little importance. M-IxTosn (oc. cit. p. 310) lays great stress on the fact that in
Ommatoplea alba the circular muscles are external and the longitudinal internal, whilst
in Borlasia the reverse is the case; and accordingly he regards these two worms as
belonging to very different types indeed.
