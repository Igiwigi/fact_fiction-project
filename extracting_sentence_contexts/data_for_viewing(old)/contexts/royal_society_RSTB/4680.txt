tubercular ornament is fine-grained and diffuse, with but obscure traces of a “ triadic”
sequence. All of these differences might be regarded as accelerations from the
Plesiechinid condition, even if, according to the general plan of ambulacral morphogeny,
they present regressive qualities. There would be nothing surprising in a stock (such
as that initiated by Plesiechinus) which was in the main conservative, giving rise to a
side-branch of more active evolutionary character. Indeed, the rate of acceleration of
the Discoidiidee and Echinonéide in Cretaceous times was, as regards the ambulacra,
far more rapid in many respects than that which could have produced Nucleolitid
from Plesiechinid structures, As far as stratigraphical evidence is available, Plesi-
echinus and Galeropygus are practically synchronous in appearance. This fact, while
not excluding the possibility of the derivation of the latter through the former, is
perhaps more suggestive of their contemporaneous origin from a common stock. At
least it shows that the differentiation of the Plesiechinid type cannot have progressed
far before the Galeropygus-series arose. While recognising that the direct evidence
as to the phyletic relationship between the two genera is fairly evenly balanced, I
incline to the view that the Nucleolitid stock diverged from the Holectypoid after
the latter had definitely separated from the Diademoida. This opinion is not based
upon ambulacral characters alone, and so cannot be discussed in detail in this place,
but it receives considerable support from some features shown in the ambulacra of
Nucleolitidee that are more advanced that Galeropygus. From a phylogenetic stand-
point the two alternatives are so similar that they cannot have much significance,
but morphogenetically considered they would introduce the operation of somewhat
