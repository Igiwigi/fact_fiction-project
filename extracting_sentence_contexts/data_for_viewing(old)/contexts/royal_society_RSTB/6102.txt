The canalicular portion of the auditory capsule has now begun to chondrify as a
curved plate, quite isolated, and covering the lateral and posterior surfaces of the semi-
circular canals (c.a.c.).

Two pairs of occipital arches are now visible at the hind end of the basal plate
(0.a. 8, 9). These obviously belong to the two absorbed occipital vertebrae, of which
they represent the neural arches, and they therefore belong to the 8th and 9th
segments. The hypocentrum of the 2nd (absorbed) occipital vertebra is still plainly
visible (h.o. 2).

Stage 5. 160 hours; figs. 40, 41, Plate 47.â€”The chief interest of this stage lies
in the fact that the trabecule have undergone further development. In the first place
they are joined together anteriorly, forming an ethmoid plate (e.p.) which constitutes
the anterior limit to the hypophysial fenestra (h.fe.). This fenestra is not yet com-
pletely enclosed, for the polar cartilages are still free from the acrochordal, but they are
attached, each to the hind end of the trabecula of its own side, by procartilage.

From each trabecula, near its anterior end, there arises a process which projects
laterally, and slightly forwards and upwards. This is the first appearance of the
structure which Sonres (1907) regarded as the lamina orbitonasalis, but which, as
we shall see, is really the anterior portion of the orbital cartilage, with its preoptic
root (0.c.a.). This is a matter of importance, for except on this view it is impossible
to understand the conditions in this region of the skull at later stages of development.
