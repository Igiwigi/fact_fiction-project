In the absence
of other experimental data it is difficult to suggest an explanation. The experiment
with the dorso-lateral preparation (p. 47), if carried out on these species, would go
far towards elucidating the main difficulties that at present exist. In view of the fact that all reptiles whose pigmentary responses have been physio-
logically investigated belong to one class, namely, the Lacertilia, and since, further,
all observations point to the conclusion that the reactions to environmental conditions
are superficially alike, namely, pallor in darkness and on exposure to high temperatures
and darkening in light, it is difficult to believe that they are physiologically totally
dissimilar, and that an elaborate apparatus of tonic innervation and central inhibition
should exist in one species and be quite unrepresented in another. In the present state of knowledge one can do no more than hope that when the
background responses of other reptiles have been thoroughly investigated, and the
problem of direct reactivity finally solved, the materials for the formulation of a general
theory of reptilian colour change will be obtained. We wish to express our sincere thanks to Mrs. ANNE StepHeNnson for the photo-

graphy and the drawing of the text figures in this paper.
