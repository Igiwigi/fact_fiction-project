These requirements ensure that the matrix

has spectral radius r(B) < 1 so that I — B is invertible. The condition r(B) < 1 is in fact necessary in
order that positive solutions can exist, see [14] for details.

This gives an explicit form of N. This form is not always the one first found by a direct approach
which often has a sum of terms of opposite signs, e.g. [15,16], but it is particularly convenient for
investigating positive solutions.

We define functions Gj by Gj := Io Go(t,s) dB;(t) for i= 1,2, by our assumptions on B; these are
non-negative. Then by changing the order of integration we have

Thus we can write Nu(t) = Io G(t, s)f(s, u(s), u’(s)) ds where G is the Green’s function given by
