indeed been surmised by some of the modern writers on the
8ubject ; but in none of them have I been able to find a cor-
roborating proof of the correctness of such a surmise. | The
examination of my mummy has afforded me that proof, in
the shape of a fifth fact, namely, the thoroughly impregna-
ted state of the bones, membranes, and muscles, in every part
of the body, by the same waxy and bituminous substance. The inspection of the bones of the pelvis, of those of the
thighs, and of the vertebre, as well as of some of the mus-
cles, and membranes, to be submitted to the Society, will
shew this abundantly. Now such a condition of the parts
could not have been produced, but by maceration or immer-
sion, for a length of time, of the whole body, into a liquefied
mixture of those two ingredients; accordingly we' must
conclude that such a process was actually followed by the
embalmers ; unless we feel disposed to believe that they in-
jected the body through the blood-vessels ; an operation of
which there is not the most distant evidence in the mummy
before us.
