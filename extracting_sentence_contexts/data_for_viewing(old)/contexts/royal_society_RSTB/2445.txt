OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 49

As it is clearly a form of importance, an effort was made to secure material for
fresh observation of the facts. Through the kindness of friends in New Zealand
specimens have been supplied upon which the following description of the sorus is
based. A vertical section through a sorus of medium age shows, as in fig. 63, the
short receptacle, sporangia, and hairs are included within the cup-like indusium ;
there is an obvious basipetal sequence of the sporangia, and I have never observed
any departure from this order. The orientation of the sporangia (well shown in the
drawings of F. Bauer) is constant, on the Gleicheniaceous type. A comparison of
the sorus of Loxsoma with that of Dennstadtia apiifolia (fig. 130) shows general
similarity, though that of Zoxsoma is the larger. The pear-shaped sporangia, which
rise obliquely upwards, have a complete annulus, as is shown in fig. 66, which
represents the “ peripheral” face; but though the complete series of cells of the ring
can usually be traced, the induration of the walls is very unequal; commonly the
cells of the distal half are enlarged, and their walls thickened ; these are mechanically
