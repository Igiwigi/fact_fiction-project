there omitted. This was in consequence of the assumption on which the analysis of
that investigation was based, that F(U, V, W) is sufficiently represented by the
terms of the first three degrees in U, V,W. We have seen in §9(C) that this is true
for a gas composed of Maxwellian molecules, but not otherwise. It seems of interest
to consider why the neglect of all the coefficients 8,, y, after = 0 led to results of
such accuracy; for the errors arising from the assumption are represented in the
special cases (249)-(251) of (237) and (248) by the factors 1°016, 1°010, 1+e,, 1+4,,
1+«, 1+4,, so that the necessary corrections to my previous formule do not exceed one
or two per cent. ENsxkoa, on the other hand, after deducing formule similar to (287),
(248), but without evaluating the coefficients 8,, y,, made a first approximation by
neglect of all these coefficients after + = 0, and arrived at the result f = 5 for rigid
elastic spheres.{ This was due to the fact that such a use of (237), (248), as they
stand, involves not only the neglect of all the coefficients after 7 = 0, but also requires an
assumption as to the values of 8, y) themselves, as, for instance, that they are approxi-
mately the same as for Maxwellian molecules ; a comparison of (196) with Table IV.
(p. 831) will show that this is far from being the case.

It may readily be seen, however, that the method of my former paper required no
