glass rod, and the specimen is invariably shattered into a number of pieces, parts being
frequently reduced to powder. ‘his shattering is not confined to the highly stressed
drawn-out fibre; it usually occurs also in the unchanged parts of the original thick
rod and sometimes in the free ends, which are not subjected to the bending moment.
The experiment .is most striking, for it appears at first sight that the 6 mm. rod has
been broken by a couple applied through the fibre, which may be only 0-5 mm. in

diameter. As a matter of fact, however, the shattering is probably merely one of the
means of dissipating the strain energy of the strong fibre, which at fracture is perhaps
10,000 times that of silica in the ordinary weak state. An elastic wave is doubtless
propagated from the original fracture, and the stresses due to this wave shatter the
rod.

Confirmation of this view is obtainable if the fibre is broken by twisting instead of
by bending. The thick part of the rod is in this case found to contain a number of
spiral cracks, at an angle of about 45° to the axis, showing that the material has broken
in tension, but the cracks run in both right- and left-handed spirals, so that the surface
of the rod is divided up into little squares. This shows that the cracking must be due
to an alternating stress, such as would result from the propagation of a torsional wave
along the rod.
