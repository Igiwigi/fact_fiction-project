In particular, the compressive strength of a laminate is reduced even at
small void contents. As the mere reduction of the void content beyond a certain level is associated
with exponentially increasing costs, the focus today is to get a better understanding about void
formation and void impact on failure initiation and propagation, especially. The compressive strength is in fact a limiting design factor because of its poor performance
in comparison with the very high tensile strength. Only ~60% of the tensile strength could be
reached [1]. A further reduction to 50% could be the result of defects like voids [2-4].
