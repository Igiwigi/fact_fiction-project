These observations were made by Miss FLORENCE MArtIN, a most careful observer,
to whom our thanks are due. She recommends that Experiment No. 8 should be
discarded, on the ground of the point of commencement not haying been so sharply
marked.

It will be noticed that the above tables indicate two things: firstly, that on the
whole the melting-point is lower when the sulphur is raised to it suddenly ; and
secondly, that all the melting-points are considerably above those given by Bropte.
The reason probably is to be found either in the fact that Bropin used imperfectly

purified sulphur, or that there is a constant evror in our thermometers, which we have
no reason to believe. The fact probably is that Bropre did not sufficiently purify
his crystals from the evil-smelling compounds which they carry with them from the
bisulphide.

Monoclinic Sulphur.â€”The melting-point of perfectly soluble monoclinic sulphur
was taken by the same observer in connection with a film which had been experi-
mented upon.
