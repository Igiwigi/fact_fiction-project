The values obtained for the alteration in the conducting power of these wires after
heating them for seyeral days to 100?, have unfortunately been lost. It may, however,
be stated that the differences were very small, and that there was a loss in conducting
power. y

The conducting power of cadmium was found in the paper already referred to—

3 Reduced to 0?.
22:10 at 188 28678.
Deducing the formula for cadmium in the manner before described, we find
=23-725—0-0874762+0:00017972.

Pure cadmium, when heated to about 80*, becomes exceedingly brittle, in fact it may
be powdered in a hot mortar with great ease. We should not have been able to carry
out the determinations if the wires had not been varnished, as the moyement of the oil
by the stirrer would haye caused them to fall to pieces. It is worthy of remark that
this change in the molecular arrangement of the wires.does not make itself apparent in
the conducting power to any yery marked extent.

Tin.

Purified by dissolving commercial tin in nitric acid, and reducing the washed oxide
by heating it with lampblack. Pressed wires were used. Table VII. gives the regults.
