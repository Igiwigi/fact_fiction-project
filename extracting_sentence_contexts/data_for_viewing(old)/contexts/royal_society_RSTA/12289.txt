with the difference of temperature between the bulb and the enclosure is of the same
nature as that connecting the loss of heat from very fine horizontal wires in air with
the difference of temperature, we should expect to find that the curve connecting the
values of e/\ and ¢ in the last table would, when plotted, be everywhere concawe to the
axis of ¢, But this is not the case, for we find on plotting this curve that while it
resembles our curves in being concave to the axis of t, for values of ¢ less than about
200° C, it changes its curvature at about this point and becomes distinctly convex.

It is, of course, to be remembered the maximum value of ¢ in the experiments of
MM. Dutone and Perrr was 240° C., while in some of ours ¢ exceeded 300° C. We
are, however, inclined to attribute the inability of the formule of MM. Dutone and
Perir to give even the general shape of the curves which we have obtained to the
fact that the convection which occurs with thermometer bulbs hardly suggests the
very great convective cooling that experiments show to occur with very fine wires at
high temperatures.—May 31, 1892.]

x centimetres from the nearer of the two supports to which the
ends of the wire are attached.
t ,, temperature of the supports.
