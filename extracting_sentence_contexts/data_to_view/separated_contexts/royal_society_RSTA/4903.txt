| _ It was pointed out many years ago by NAuMANN, when experimental evidence was
‘Seanty, that 8 divided by the number of atoms in the molecule was nearly equal
to 33. If this held generally, it would be an important fact, for it would point to

approximation to ‘33, but no more. Even allowing for the exaggeration of
experimental error by the nature of the equation connecting 8 and y, it can no}
said that the intramolecular energy is proportional to the number of atoms in
molecule.
