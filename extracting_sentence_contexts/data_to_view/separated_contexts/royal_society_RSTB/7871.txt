This is not really so;
the clitoris is large, even for the size of the animal, but the penis is very much larger and
more extensible. To what extent the clitoris of the elephant is erectile is unknown; that it
is sensitive is obvious from observation of captive elephants. Notwithstanding its usually sluggish movements, the elephant is in fact a supple and
agile animal. It is sometimes forgotten that its usefulness in the Burma teak forests depends
not only on its strength but on its ability to work in very difficult terrain. The writer has
seen wild African elephants climb with ease up rough slopes which he would have judged
impassable to them, and which would perhaps have deterred an agile pony.
