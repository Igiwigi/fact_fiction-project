of pith parenchyma on which the meristem is seated; but ultimately, the substances stored
in the pith are referable in origin to the leaves and roots.

(b) The effect of puncturing the apical cell
Even the most careful puncturing of the apical cell is attended by some disruption of
the adjacent cells. An investigation of the distribution of stresses at the extreme tip is
therefore likely to prove of interest; the indications are that the apical cell and those ad-

jacent to it are under compressive stress. This is inferred from: (a) a consideration of cell
growth and division at the apex; (6) the fact that when the apex is punctured the hole
does not become distended; and (c) the considerable exudation of sap on puncturing and
the collapse of adjacent cells. It has, however, been found possible to puncture the apical
cell so that the subsequent necrosis was slight, i.e. involving the apical cell and its im-
mediate segments only.

When the apical cell is destroyed, lateral buds are formed, first in the subapical region
and then in the apical meristem itself; buds are also formed on meristems which have, in
addition, been isolated from the subapical region. Hence it may be inferred that the
substance responsible for the inhibition of buds in the normal development is formed in
the apical cell, and probably its immediate segments, and not necessarily in the apical
meristem as a whole. The apical cell in Dryopteris, and presumably in other leptosporangiate
ferns also, is thus seen to have a particular physiological importance. This finding is very
