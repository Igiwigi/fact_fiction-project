also tends to confirm statements made in my Memoir, Part X. (‘ Phil. Trans., 1880,
p- 493), when describing the Arran Lepidodendron. I there gave my reasons for
believing that, though no medulla was present in the centre of the vascular axis of
any of the young twigs and branches of that branch, one had somehow or other been
developed at a later stage of growth in those vascular bundles. Other conditions of
these Arran specimens being considered, it now becomes an almost absolute certainty
that such had been the case. The history of figs. 19, 20, and 21 of the present Memoir
bears upon the same question, but little more can be said in reference to this latter
plant until we obtain specimens of it in a more advanced state of growth. Though it
and the Arran plant possess several features in common, I cannot identify them with
sufficient definiteness to assign the same name to both. This, however, is of no
consequence for the present, since I have not yet given any name to the Arran plant.
Rather more important is the fact that M. Renauur speaks of a stem having a solid
vascular axis, like that of Lepidodendron Spenceri, to which stem he has given the
name of L. Rhodumnense. The following description shows that it has some features
in common with my plant :—La cavité centrale, due soit & un déchirement du tissu,
soit 4 ce que le procambium n’a pas achevé sa lignification, est cylindrique, dans les
échantillons non déformés, toujours de dimension extrémement réduite, et ne présentant
que des traces douteuses de tissu cellulaire.t Details in the structure of the cortex
of L. Rhodumnense indicate a specific difference between it and my plant.

The Lepidodendron intermedium, figs. 16, 17, and 18, has a special interest when
viewed in connection with the plant which I some time ago named Lepidodendron
Suliginosum.{ In my Memoir, Part XI.,§ in Plate 49, fig. 11, I represented a segment
of a transverse section of the innermost cortex of this plant, in which a very rudimen-
