This 2n-gon is a“ fundamental region” for the group generated from the substi-
tutions T,, T,,...T,. We proved in § 2 that the group generated by T,, T.,... T.,
is a self-conjugate sub-group of the group formed by §,, &:,... 8,42; and that any
substitution of the latter group is equivalent to a substitution of the former group
acting on either the identical substitution or on S,,; This corresponds to the fact
that a point in any of the derived 2n-gons can be obtained by transformation with
