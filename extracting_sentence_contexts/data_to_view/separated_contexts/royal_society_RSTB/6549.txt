Its relation to the premaxilla and to the maxilla shows it to be almost
certainly the upper canine. This would substantiate Broom’s view that the corre-
sponding tooth of the lower jaw, i.e. “‘f”’, is the lower canine. In confirmation of the suggestion that ‘“f” was originally a tooth of considerable
importance is the fact that in all my specimens in which itis present I find it represented
by a papillated enamel organ, while in specimens XXVIII B, H.N. and H.J. an actual
dentinal nodule is formed. Canine Premolars Molars
