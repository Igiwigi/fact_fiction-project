fem been reduced on this assumption, together with another based partly on
leulation for Foucault currents. When the value of « given by the results is deduced
feom a series of equations by the methods indicated above the exponent unity seems
@ agree just as well, sometimes better, than 1°6. An excellent series of experiments
far this purpose have recently been made by Mr. ALEXANDER SremMENs and the results
= to the Institute of Electrical Engineers.* In this paper also the losses
m Foucault currents are calculated on an assumption of size of wire, specific resist-
Bice, &e. The estimate of the energy dissipated seems to be somewhat too small, and
ith a proper correction on it, about 25 per cent., the dissipation given under hysteresis
Becomes simply proportional to the induction. The results of these experiments
eated by the simultaneous equation method for the determination of the law of
#ariation of the different elements of the dissipation give for Foucault currents AT?
for hysteresis BI’ with almost perfect exactness. The fact that a sufficient
umber of fairly accurate experiments furnishes data for the mathematical deter-
Bination of the law of variation of the different elements entering into the dissipation
‘ef energy in cases like that here considered seems to have been very generally

Averlooked.

[Note added June 20, 1893.—Subsequent experiments, the results of which I
hope soon to place before the Royal Society, show that the constant A in the above
equation should have been zero, as there is practically no Foucault current loss. The
exponent « is also shown by these experiments to agree closely with the number
obtained by Mr. Srummerz from Professor Ew1ne’s experiments and, since this
Paper was written, more fully established by his own experiments.
