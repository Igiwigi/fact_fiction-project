The plastic nature of the viscous lavas of Vesuvius and Etna is such as well might
obliterate any internal traces of rents due to differential velocity, which, in the mass,
are speedily closed and reunited as in a stream of treacle, or in the plaster models
before explained, where the interior is homogeneous and the Superficial coating above
is permanently dislocated. In lavas the indescribable ruggedness of the surface very generally prevents any
record of the gentler play of forces. The following facts appear to me quite conclu-
sive as to the manner in which a mass partially solidified, yet moving as a fluid, is
torn up by the interior forces which act upon it. 1. At Vesuvius, the Fossa della Fetrana between the Hermitage and Monte Somma,
is a valley lined with the lava of 1751.
