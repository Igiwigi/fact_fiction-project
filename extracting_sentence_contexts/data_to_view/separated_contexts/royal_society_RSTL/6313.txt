It would therefore in all pro
bability be really the case, that in the average of the instances brought under the caleu-
lation, the increase would contain a less proportion of both mineral and nitrogenous
matter, and a larger one of both fat and total dry substance, than that of the single

* These figures are somewhat corrected from those given in the Report of the British Ax80ciation for the
Advancement of Science for 1852, where the composition of the increase of this analysed * fat pig” is given
as follows :—mineral matter 0-43, nitrogen 1:33 (equal about 8:38 nitrogenous compounds), 63:4 fat, and

ysed Pig. With regard to the amount of mineral matter in the increase, attention

4 be called to the fact, that, according to the figures in the Table, it was always
small ; whilst, in many cases, there was apparently no increase whatever, but even
of mineral matter during the fattening process. From the general character and
jits of the animal, and its known tendency to fatten rather than to grow, we 8hould
ed anticipate that the bony frame-work, which is the chief storehouse of mineral
er, would develop proportionally much less in the fattening Pig, than in either
ning Sheep or Oxen. Still, it would be hardly safe to assume, upon the evidence of
the analysis of two animals alone, that there would frequently be an actual reduction of
F e total mineral matter of the body, during the fattening period.
