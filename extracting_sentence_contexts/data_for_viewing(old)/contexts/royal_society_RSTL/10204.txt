produced (increase of the cross difference), which in the first experiment of the series
amounted to one-hundredth of a DANIELL, did not in the later ones exceed one-five
hundredth. The indication that these phenomena afford that the electrical difference
which exists in the unexcited leaf of Dionzwa between the opposite surfaces is in
physiological relation with the excitatory properties of the leaf will receive confirma-
tion when, in the nexb part of this paper, we have before us the immediate effects of
excitation.

In the short communication I made to the Royal Society in 1873, in which I
announced the discovery of the excitatory electrical change in the leaf of Dionza, T
stated the existence of a © leaf current” directed from the proximal to the distal end
of the midrib in the uninjured leaf. I had observed that, in general, the attached end
of the midrib was negative to the further end, and expressed this fact in the language
commonly used in physiological writings. I had also found that the under surface of
the leaf talk in the neighbourhood of the joint by which the leaf is attached to it,
was negative to the rest of the leaf stalk, and designated this negativity by the term
*stalk current.” I had further observed that if the current from a battery (a 8mall
DaxIeLiL's cell) was directed through the leaf stalk at the same time that the two
ends of the midrib were led off to the galvanometer, the difference previously
existing between the ends of the midrib was increased if the current led through the
leaf s8talk were in the same direction with the leaf current, diminished if it were in the
opposite direction. I had finally observed that in leaves seyered from the plant, the
*leaf current ” was curiously dependent on the length of the petiole,* 80 that the
shorter the petiole the greater was the negativity of the proximal end as compared
with the distal. Of these four observations relating to the electromotive properties of
