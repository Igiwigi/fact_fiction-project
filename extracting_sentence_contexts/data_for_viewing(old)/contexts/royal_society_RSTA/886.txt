measurement and the conductance across a normal metalâ€”insulator-superconductor junction. At
resonance, microwave radiation is absorbed by the precessing out-of-equilibrium quasi-particle
magnetization.

Some data from [86] are shown in figure 5. Figure 5a,b shows spin resonances obtained for two
devices with superconducting Al bars of different thicknesses (dq = 8.5nm and dg = 6nm). The
resonant field as a function of the microwave frequency from these and other measurements is
reported in figure 5c. A linear fit to the data gives a g-factor of 1.95 + 0.2, consistent with previous


measurements of electrons in Al in the normal state (figure 5c). The spin relaxation time T> is also
shown in figure 5c. Tz = 95 + 20 ps (70 + 15 ps) for Al that was 8.5 nm (6 nm) thick. Both the order
of magnitude of T2 , as well as the fact that it is inversely proportional to the film thickness, are
consistent with spin coherence limited primarily by the Elliott-Yafet spin-orbit scattering time
Tso [46,47]. Further, these figures agree with an independent, equilibrium measurement of ts
(figure 5d).

We note that, unlike normal metals, where Tz =T1, the spin imbalance relaxation time, in
superconductors T is much larger than Tz, and that T2 is of the order of the spin imbalance
relaxation time measured in the normal state [56,57], consistent with plural sources and relaxation
mechanisms of spin imbalance in the superconducting state [87].
