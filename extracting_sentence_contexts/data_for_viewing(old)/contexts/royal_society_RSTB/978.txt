By a careful regulation of the anesthetic state in the species of animal us
recognition of the exact spot excited, and by employing a suitable stimulus, a co
effect upon respiration can be obtained from the cerebral cortex according to the

It is absolutely necessary, in order to get constant results, that the de
anesthesia employed should be accurately recognized. This has apparently n
done before. While some previous observers have, in fact, not used an an

different observers on non-anzesthetized animals have yielded variable results,
the fact that other disturbing factors have not been taken into account.

of the respiratory rhythm, and, as a consequence of this acceleration, slowing, or
short arrest. During the prevalence of the apnea the excitability of the
