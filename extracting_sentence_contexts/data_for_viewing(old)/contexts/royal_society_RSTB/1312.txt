3 the ending mere to signify the final condition or product.

4 Hence, each Myotome produces (1) one Myomere, cr segment, of the general mass

@ trunk muscles; (2) Cutis (out of the “aeussere Lage,” or Rindenschicht,

Borer, p. 208).

= Of Sklerotomes, there are two to each protovertebra, namely, a ventral and a

@rsal Sklerotome ; two Sklerotomes combine to form one Skleromere, i.e., a vertebra

D the widest sense, in fact, a skeletal trunk segment.

3 The sum total of the Sklerotomes forms the so-called membranous vertebral column,

extending upwards and downwards as the “ Membrana reuniens” of Rercuert, and
twards in the shape of the intermuscular septa.

The ventral sklerotomes correspond exactly with the sklerotomes of vAaN WHE

and Rast. The dorsal sklerotomes have hitherto been neglected. Ba.rour stated

correctly that in Stage L of his Hlasmobranchs there appear four thickenings, namely,
