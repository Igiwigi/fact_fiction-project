In an early stage of this process the outflowing protoplast is often drawn out to a point
at the two poles, and as in resting spore formation remains for some time connected
by a fine protoplasmic filament with the valves near the insertion of the spine (fig. 16a,
Plate 3). If isolated in such a stage the auxospore will be completed within less than 24 hr. Mostly the protoplasm flows out simultaneously from both arms (fig. 16a, Plate 3)
and the empty shells may remain for some time loosely attached to the auxospore.
(They were, in fact, in contact with the auxospore represented in fig. 165 (Plate 3)

but became detached when pipetted on a cavity slide for drawing.) Sometimes,
however, the protoplasm leaves one arm first while still occupying part of the other
(fig. 17a, Plate 3). Since the empty shell drops off very easily the remaining arm with
the outflowing protoplasm might suggest a formation of auxospores different from that
described above and similar to that of Melosira Borreri (p. 35).
