on air found in the pleura, &c. 515

from the frontal sinus of
4.5 carbonic acid gas,
9.5 oxygene,
86.0 azote. On the supposition that the air, previous to its entering
these cavities, had undergone a partial change from respira-
tion, the results described seem to indicate an absorption of
oxygene. Other facts might be adduced, which, like the preceding,
though not conclusive, tend to support the idea; that mucous
membranes are capable of absorbing air. Of this Kind, I
conceive, are the results of the experiments of Messrs, MAa-
GENDIE and CHEVREUL, on the composition of the air con-
tained in the human stomach and intestines ;# and very
recently, I have met with a fact, the bearing of which
appears to be similar. In examining the body of a soldier,
who had died of complicated disease, I found the head of the
colon and the ccecum exceedingly distended with air, and of
a bright red colour, as if highly inflamed, whilst the ascend-
ing colon was unusually contracted.
