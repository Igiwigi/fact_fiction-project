That there is a seasonal influence
is undoubted but the relationship is not simple as has been commonly supposed, but S much more complex. A considerable part of the influence.seems to be due to the fact

that it is not unusual for the complete cycle of the life-history of the measles organism
2 to correspond almost exactly with a multiple of the solar year, in itself a suggestive
5 coincidence, but even if this has been fully allowed for something remains which
a requires further analysis. I hope some day to discuss these problems, but when it is
¢ remembered that, even with a disease such as summer diarrhoea, in which the
‘ dependence of the size of the epidemic on the degree of summer temperature is
=» Obvious, no one has succeeded in demonstrating any simple connection, it is possible
z that the explanation of the relationship of epidemics of measles to the solar year may
‘6 yet be far in the future. 2 APPENDIX.
