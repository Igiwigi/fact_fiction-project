No mention is made of this in the text. WacGner (1898) finds in
Neomysis two groups of cells in the precise positions of the preantennulary mesoderm

masses in Hemimysis, but interprets them as parts of the cerebral ganglia. His figures 18
and 19, Plate 1, exactly represent what is found in Hemimysis at a stage between that of
Plate 24, figs. 22 and 23. his error in interpretation is quite understandable considering
the technique used at that time and the fact that the preantennulary strands are least
distinct from the nervous rudiments at this period. It is in the later stages of develop-
ment that the derivations of the preantennulary mesoderm are so frequently figured
just as they occur in Hemimysis. In Mysis chameleo NusBauM (1887) saw the strand of tissue between the dorsal organ
and the stomodeum dividing the two anterior yolk lobes.
