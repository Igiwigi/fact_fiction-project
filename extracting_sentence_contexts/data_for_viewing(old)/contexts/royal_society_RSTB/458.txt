possess in them an instructive instance of the effects of heredity under circumstances
in which sexual selection has been neutral. The very existence of the patterns has
been hitherto almost overlooked, because they are too small to attract attention, or
thought too uninteresting to notice. Neither do they appear to be correlated with
any desirable or repellent quality. It is true that the breadth of a ridge-interval
may afford a direct indication of the delicacy or the reverse of the sense of touch, as
measured by the just discernible distance between compass points, and some indirect
indication of the sensibility generally. (I do not know that it is, but have planned

experiments for testing the supposition.) Yet, even if so, the fact would have no
bearing on the attractiveness or otherwise of any particular pattern, because the form of
a pattern has nothing to do with the fineness or coarseness of the ridges that compose
it. There has, therefore, been complete promiscuity of marriages, or, as it is now
called, panmixia, in respect to these patterns. We might consequently have expected
them to be hybridised. But that is most assuredly not the case; they refuse to
blend. â€˜Their classes are as clearly separated as those of any of the genera of plants
and animals, while we happen to know enough about their origin to understand that
this must be the case, inasmuch as they are intrinsically different. Each of the
patterns keeps as pure and distinct from the others as if they had been severally
descended from a thorough-bred ancestry, each in respect to its own peculiar form.

As regards the influence of all other kinds of natural selection, we know that they
