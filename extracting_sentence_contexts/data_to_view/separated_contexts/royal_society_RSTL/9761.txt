of nitrogen were applied per acre annually, It will
be remembered that the surface-soil of the continuously mineral-manured plot showed a
lower percentage of nitrogen than that of the continuously unmanured plot, indicating
the source whence the increased yield of nitrogen in the mineral manured complex
herbage had been derived. The data at command do not enable us to give a decisive answer on these points,
but i will be of interest briefly to notice the facts bearing upon them. In the first place, not quite three-fourths as much nitrogen was taken off in the
