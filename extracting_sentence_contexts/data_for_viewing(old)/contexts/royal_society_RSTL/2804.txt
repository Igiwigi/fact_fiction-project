death ; whether it be occasioned by injury of the sanguiferons or nervous
system, or both.

Such then appears to be the nature of respiration. The first act is the im-
pression made on the sensorium, the sensation excited by the want of fresh air
in the lungs. We are enabled to supply it, and thus remove the uneasiness, by
exciting certain muscles subjected to the will. Through nerves which are
fitted for this purpose, we apply a stimulus to certain muscles which perform
the act required. Thus respiration is the combined act of the sensorial nervous
and mnscular powers. It is as effectually destroyed by a failure of the sensa-
tion which makes us will to inspire, as by that of the nervous or muscular
power by which the will effects its object. With this view of the subject be-
fore us, and I can see no other which the facts admit of, it will be proper to
examine the nature of respiration more in detail.

T have already had occasion to observe, that the effort made in ordinary
breathing is very slight. It is chiefly performed by the diaphragm, by the con-
traction of which the cavity of the chest being slightly enlarged perpendicularly,
the pressure of the atmosphere readily causes the air cells to be distended with
air; but if any obstacle occurs tending to prevent the passage of the air to the
cells, a greater effort is required, and other muscles are called into action. It
seems almost unnecessary to observe, that the sensation which induces us to
make this greater effort, must, as the object is still the same, operate in the
same way. The more powerful sensation indeed, and the trouble the effort
gives us, by calling our attention to it, enables us at once to perceive that it
