When we substitute this in (101), we obtain the three equations

The boundary conditions for the functions f, g,, g, are

FO=P, HOM=0 gO) =O, =O, gM=O0,.. . (106)

the last two arising from the fact that p must be single valued at the apex.
From (103) we obtain

reg sino Se Pe eae (107)
where C is a constant of integration. Hence
pp = bun |” Rh- tdo +O) R a ro (108)

where C’ is another constant of integration. To avoid a singularity at the apex, we
must take C = 0; then (106) gives 0’ =P. Hence fis given by

We may state the following result :—
