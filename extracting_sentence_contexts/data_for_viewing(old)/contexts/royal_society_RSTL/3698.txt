learned, by an examination of, and quotations from, ancient writers ; whereas the
problem to be solved was more one of physical geography, and belonged more to the
geologist than to the man of letters. Admitting the theory of HeropoTus as to the
mode of formation of the Delta, he combats that part of it in which he refers the
operation to historical time.

That there has been an annual inundation of the Nile, of greater or less amount,
from the earliest period to which history or tradition reaches, does not admit of a
doubt ; and it is equally certain that the river 80 flooded was loaded with solid mate-
rials, for the fertilizing effect of a sediment left upon the ground is recorded equally
with the fact of an annual inundation*Â®. Unless therefore this same addition was
wholly washed away again from the surface between the fall of the water of one year
and the rise of the next, there must have been an accumulation from year to year.
That the fertilizing effect of the inundation is exhausted, or nearly $0, is true ; but in a
country where there are no streams tributary to the main river, where rain is almost.
unknown in the greater portion of it, that is in Upper Egypt, and with an inclination
s0 8light as that of the land over which the inundation spreads, the solid insoluble
matter must in great part remain where it is deposited. That the fertilizing effect of
the inundation is increased in proportion to the depth of the water, is shown by the
unequivocal proof that the taxes, from time immemorial, have been levied upon the
land according to the height to which the river rises-. It was to regulate this impost
that the Nilometer on the island of Elephantine near the First Cataract was erected
in ancient times, and that a similar instrument was set up in the island of Rhoda,
