OF THE FLAME IN THE EXPLOSION OF GASES. 319

little doubt that it really exists. Recnaunr and Wrepemann both found a distinct
increase at constant pressure between 100° C. and 200°C. I have lately, in con-
junction with Mr. F. W. Rrxon, determined the specific heat of carbonic acid at
constant volume at 100° C., 200° C., 300° C., and 400° C., and find a steady rise in
the constant.* On the other hand, the facility with which carbonic acid breaks up
under the influence of electric discharges indicates that, as its temperature is raised,
work is done in loosening the chemical bonds—work which Berruetor ealls “ le
travail de désagrégation moléculaire qui précéde la décomposition.” Of the fact ot
the partial dissociation of carbonic acid and steam at the temperature of the detona-
tion-wave, Mr. H. W. Smirn and I have found. direct proof in the unburnt gases
left on cooling. t

Liverne and Dewar} showed in 1884 that the flame of an explosion of gases in a

_ glass vessel exhibited with marked brightness the lines of sodium and of calcium.

When the explosion ot electrolytic gas was made to pass along an iron tube about
3 feet long, closed at one end by a plate of quartz, a spectroscope placed in a line
with the axis of the tube revealed the fact that the light was largely due to iron
lines. When metallic salts in the form of powder were introduced into the explosion
