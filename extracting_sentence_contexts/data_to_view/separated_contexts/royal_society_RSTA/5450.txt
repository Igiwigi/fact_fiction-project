structure of a reaction—-diffusion problem. For exponential isotropic growth, the dilution term :s
in fact becomes constant, so that homogeneous steady states on a static domain can be used to :s
find homogeneous steady states in such a growing domain with the kinetics modified by this ‘8

constant term. Under the further assumption that this growth is sufficiently slow, Madzvamuse
et al. [135] showed that one can obtain small but significant corrections to the classical Turing
conditions, in some sense justifying quasi-static approximations mentioned above. While these
analytical results were only small modifications of the classical conditions (valid for slow growth),
they are significant in showing how growth can modify a system’s ability to undergo Turing-type
instabilities, relaxing some of the restrictions on pattern forming systems.
