“respiration pénible et de suffocation qui accompagne toujours la section simultanée
des deux nerfs pneumo-gastriques,” and died on the second day after the operation.
He concludes that reunion takes places between the crossed nerves in every case, and
that function returns in the first case, but not where the pneumo-gastrie is joined to
the spinal nerve.

Various investigators subsequently approached the same subject, ScuHwaNN (1),
Sreirick, Brpper (3), Guuee and TurerNesse (4, 6), and Pxamireaux and
VuuprAn (5) taking part, their work consisting in the main in investigating the
possibility of union between functionally different nerves, such as the hypoglossal
with the lingual, to see if union was possible between such.

No surgical application so far had been made of these physiological facts, but in
1873, Lirnivanr(7) made the following suggestion* under the name of greffe
nerveuse :—* Un nerf vient d’éprouver une grande perte de substance; rechercher
son bout inférieur, l'aviver et le suturer 4 un bout appartenant & un autre nerf,
divisé aussi par la blessure, mais plus bas que le premier et moins important que lui.”

No one took up the exact type of Frourens’ experiment again until Rawa (9),
who published his investigation in 1883 in abstract and in 1885 in full. He crossed
nerves of different function, and also nerves of the same function, namely, the
posterior tibial and the peroneal, crossing thus the nerves supplying the flexors and
extensors of the hind leg. He concluded from his work that cross union between two
motor nerves takes place with restoration of function, and that even when nerves so
different as the hypoglossal and pneumo-gastric were crossed, union and efficient
