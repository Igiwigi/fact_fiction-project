Sthe gigantic land-lizard has long been extinct.

= The proccelian type of vertebra, or that in which the articular cup is in front and the
Sball behind, characteristic of the fossils above described, was first introduced in the
ZReptilian class, according to present knowledge, during the liassic period ; but, from
"=that to the upper oolite, it was manifested only by Pterodactyles. The earliest exam-
ples of proccelian vertebre in Lacertian reptiles date from the Wealden period ; in Croco-
Sdilian reptiles the proccelian type first appears at the cretaceous period *,

Z The only known proccelian lizards comparable in size with the large Australian one,
Erepresented by the three above-described vertebrz, are the Mosgsaurus and Leiodon of
Athe Greensand and Chalk strata,

The inferior depth of the cup and production of the ball, the vertical position of both
at right angles with the axis of the centrum, and many minor modifications of the ver-
tebrz of those large Lacertians of the cretaceous period, show great differences between
them and the fossil proccelian vertebra of the freshwater tertiary deposits of Australia. The Mosasauroids were, in fact, a family of marine lizards s0 distinct from existing spe-
cies, as to form the type of a suborder. The fossil remains of European proccelian lizards, which, like the large vertebra under
