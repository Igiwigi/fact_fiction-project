W. K. PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND

The meaning of these facts will come out with great distinctness when I come to
describe their development in the ©* Aglossal” Toads; and in all the Batrachia we have
most instructive foreshadowings of the complex nasal labyrinth of the bird, and of the
endless galleries of the ethmoidal and septal structures of carnivorous and herbivorous
mammals. At once it may be well to state that in those higher forms the distal ends of the
trabeculz, © hypotrabecular ” or © recurrent cartilages,” do not straighten ont, as in
these Batrachia ; but the hooked or retral condition seen in the Bird and Pig also occurs
in many of the Batrachia, The median or keystone part (prenasal or basitrabecular
cartilage) is but little deyeloped in the Frog (Plate 54. figs. 1 & 2, pn.); it is more
distinct in Pipa (Plate 62. figs. 5 & 6, pn.). The actual end of the trabecular cornu remains as a shrunken pedate process with its
* toe” turned to that of its fellow of the opposite side; this is the * rhinal process”
of HuxLey, whose figure (op. cit. fig. 9, p. 755) seems to show it as a distinet cartilage :
it is, however, continuous with the outspread subnasal plate (al.n.) formed by expan-
Sion of the laryal trabecular bar.
