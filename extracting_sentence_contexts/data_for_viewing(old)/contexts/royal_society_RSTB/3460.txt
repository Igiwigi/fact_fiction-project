It remains to be considered whether the Gnetoid endosperm is unique or whether,
on the other hand, it may not be regarded as representing a primitive condition, from
which that of the higher seed-bearing plants has been evolved. The former is the
product of the division of many fusion-nuclei, the latter of one; in both the fusion-
nucleus results from the union of nuclei of the same generation as the functional
gametes. Angiosperms are described in which the endosperm is apparently formed
without antecedent nuclear fusion ; these seem to be exceptional and rare.

The sac of Peperomia exhibits certain peculiarities, on account of which a comparison
between it and that of Gnetum has already been suggested.* In the four-nucleate
stage of P. pellucida the sae shows no polarity, but the nuclei are arranged
peripherally, “like the spores of a tetrad”+—in fact, precisely as in Welwitschia
in the corresponding stage (fig. 16). When the mitoses are completed there are
sixteen nuclei in the sac belonging to the fifth generation from the macrospore.
These are “rather evenly distributed through the sac”; one of them increases
in size and becomes the nucleus of the oosphere ; of the rest, eight fuse to form the
primary endosperm-nucleus. Each successive division of this nucleus and its
descendants is followed by the formation of cell-walls,t as in Welwitschia. In
P. hispidula, of the sixteen sac-nuclei all but two fuse to form the definitive
nucleus.§ The general resemblance of this process to that by which the Welwitschia
endosperm is formed is very striking ; in both cases the constituents of the primary
endosperm nuclei are of the same generation as the functional gametes ; in
Welwitschia, not only is this the case, but the constituents of the fusion-nuclei
are themselves potential gametes. There is no evidence that the fusing nuclei ot
