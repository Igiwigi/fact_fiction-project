The chemical composition, however, is similar to other arthropods [104]. In addition
to a perfect superhydrophobicity, the collembola surfaces also repel a broad range of organic
solvents and may resist pressures up to six bar [115]. The most surprising fact still is that
the superhydrophobicity is purely structurally determined and independent of the chemical
basis [115,116]. For this reason, the highly complex surface topography exhibiting overhanging
surface structures with undercuts evolved. First attempts have been made to transfer these
properties to technical materials [117,118].
