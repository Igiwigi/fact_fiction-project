of the former research.

10. Moreover, it will appear that in the curve indicating the form of flexure to the
third pillar, Plate XXXII., the distance Abe will apply to the first pillar, Abed to the
second pillar, and bedef to the third pillar; these distances being inversely as 2, 3, 4, the
1:7th powers of which are 3-249, 6-473, 10-556, and the 1:6th powers 3:031, 5:8, 919,
or as 1, 2, 3, nearly.

11. Hence, of three pillars of the same length and diameter, one with both ends
rounded, one with one end rounded and one end flat, and the other with both ends flat,
the strengths are as 1,2, 3.

The following facts, from the subsequent experiments, illustrate the last of the pre-
ceding figures. See also forms of fracture, Plate XXXIII.

In pillars of © Second London Mixture,” 2 feet 6 inches long and 14 inch diameter,
fracture took place near to the middle and by breaking across near each end.

A pillar of Old Hill iron, 5 feet long and 24 inches diameter, broke in the middle,
and broke across near each end.

In pillars 6 feet 3 inches long, fracture took place in the middle, and each end became
split. This was the casc in all these pillars.

In pillars 7 feet 6 inches long and 24 inches in diameter—that of Derwent iron broke
