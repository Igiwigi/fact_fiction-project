In summary, for the liquid-phase glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction using PdRu
bimetallic catalyst supported in different zeolite type frameworks, the activity follows the order
ZSM-5 >> MOR [20:1] > HY[5.1:1] which is in partial agreement with the reported trends for
glycerol dehydration reaction [13,34]. From the previous results, TiO2 is found to be a promising support and it has been reported
that addition of WO, has a positive effect in increasing the selectivity of C3 products during
glycerol hydrogenolysis [35]. Based on these two facts, a mixed metal oxide containing both
TiOz and WO, was prepared (Tig.999Wo.09102) and used as a support for PdRu nanoparticles. Entry 1 in table 1 shows the results achieved by the 2 wt% PdRu/Tig.9Wo,102 catalyst. It gave
the best selectivity to 1,2-PDO, followed by the SiO2 (Entry 9) and TiO2 (Entry 2) supported
catalysts.
