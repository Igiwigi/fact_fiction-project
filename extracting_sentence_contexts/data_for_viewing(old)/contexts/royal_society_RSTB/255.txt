developed nerves proceeding to an electric plate, which is not only complete, but,
being apparently in advance of the development of the supporting cup, extends some
distance over its margin.

In support of the view that the electric organ of FR. radiata is a progressive
structure, or, if not still advancing, that it has been comparatively recently arrested
in its progress, there is, first, the remarkable developmental history. I have

already pointed out that, while the electric organ of 2. batis is late in making
its first appearance, the organ of Ft. radiata is very much later; that, in fact, while
in an embryo R#. batts 12 cm. in length the three essential layers of the complex
Gilises have already been established, in a R. radiata completely developed and of a
â€œonsiderable size (Plate 79, fig. 8), the muscular fibres (now long and well developed)
Sve only beginning to pass into the primary clubs. I have shown, further, that the
Zlubs pass slowly through a series of intermediate stages before the cup form is
yassumed, and that the cups when eventually completed slowly increase in size as the
kate increases in length, and that in the largest specimens of F. radiata examined
Ghere was no indication of degeneration, either in the electric cups or in the nerves
Bassing to them.
20 In fact, the history of the development of the cups in 2. radiata seems to be, as
far as it goes, a complete record of the more important changes which have taken place
Gin the evolution of electric organs out of muscular fibres. There is at no period any
