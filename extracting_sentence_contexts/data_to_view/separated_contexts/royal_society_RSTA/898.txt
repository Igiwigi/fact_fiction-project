Indeed, in the 2
macroscopic case [40] one does not even ask for the state of the system to remain unchanged, : &
but only for the outcomes of the consecutive measurements to be identical (i.e. the evidence of 22
repeatability is in the outcomes). Still, even under these rather weak assumptions, one is forced [4
to conclude that quantum states can exert distinguishable influences and remain unperturbed only when : *
they are orthogonal. To arrive at this conclusion we only used postulate (i)—the fact that when two : =
vectors in the Hilbert space are identical, then physical states they correspond to must also be : =
identical. .

(b) Discussion

The emergence of orthogonal outcome states is established above on the foundation of very basic
(and very quantum) assumptions. It leads one to conclude that observables are indeed associated
with Hermitian operators. Hermitian observables are usually introduced in a very different manner—they are the
(postulated!) quantum versions of the familiar classical quantities.
