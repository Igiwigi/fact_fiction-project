This great difference of velocity, due to the difference in the molecular properties of
the material of the rocks in their opposite directions, is, as our Holyhead experiments
prove, almost wholly obliterated by the vastly increased degree of discontinuity and
shattering, in the directions approaching that of lamination, or transverse to the wave-
path in the first case. It is necessary to guard against any misconception as to the import of this result. The fact ascertained and just enunciated is this, that the velocity of wave-transmission
is greater in the material of these rocks in a direction across their lamination than in
one longitudinal to the same, provided or asming the material be perfectly unshattered
in bothâ€”as homogeneous, in fact, as the s8mall specimen-cubes experimented upon. And were the whole mass of the rock, as it lies in its mountain-bed, as homogeneous
as such cubes, then the velocity of wave-transmission would actually be greater across
long ranges of natural lamination, than edgeways to them. The opposite, however, is
often the case; the wave-transit period is slower as the range of rocky mass is more
$hattered, discontinuous, and dislocated.
