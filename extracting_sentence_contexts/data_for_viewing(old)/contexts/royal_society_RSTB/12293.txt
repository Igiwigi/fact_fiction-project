(bed nucleus of the stria terminalis), the substantia innomi-
nata (including the basal nucleus of Meynert), nucleus
accumbens, septum, preoptic area of the hypothalamus,
hypothalamus, midline thalamus and zona incerta in the sub-
thalamus [120,131]. Interestingly, stimulation in different
limbic areas produced different call types, while lesions in
the amygdala or hypothalamus suppressed distinct types of
spontaneously uttered vocalizations [108,151].

The relatively long latency of the vocal responses elicited
from these sites (greater than 1s) and their fast habituation
are consistent with stimulation-induced affective changes
rather than primary motor responses [120]. In fact, studies
of freely moving squirrel monkeys that could either seek or
avoid electrical stimulation support the idea that the vocaliza-
tions elicited from many of these limbic areas result from
stimulation-induced changes in affective state [120]. A
notable exception was the ACC, for which elicited vocaliza-
tion and specific affective states were not correlated.

Compared to the other limbic forebrain areas, the influence
of the ACC on vocal behaviour thus seems to be more direct.
