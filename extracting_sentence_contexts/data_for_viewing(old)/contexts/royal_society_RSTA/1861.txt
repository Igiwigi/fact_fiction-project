much harsher reaction condition [13,14]. Among other catalysts, PdRu/TiO} is the most selective
catalyst for 1,2-PDO (33%) at ca. 20% glycerol conversion. Other catalysts resulted in lesser
selectivity for 1,2-PDO:PdRu/MOR (17%), PdRu/ZSM5-200:1 (16%) and PdRu/Al,O3 (19%).
All these catalysts showed appreciable selectivity towards EG (between 22 and 36%). Importantly,
PdRu/TiOz showed the least selectivity for CH4 (11%) in comparison to other supports
(33-37%). In summary, for the liquid-phase glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction using PdRu
bimetallic catalyst supported in different zeolite type frameworks, the activity follows the order
ZSM-5 >> MOR [20:1] > HY[5.1:1] which is in partial agreement with the reported trends for
glycerol dehydration reaction [13,34].

From the previous results, TiO2 is found to be a promising support and it has been reported
that addition of WO, has a positive effect in increasing the selectivity of C3 products during
glycerol hydrogenolysis [35]. Based on these two facts, a mixed metal oxide containing both
TiOz and WO, was prepared (Tig.999Wo.09102) and used as a support for PdRu nanoparticles.
Entry 1 in table 1 shows the results achieved by the 2 wt% PdRu/Tig.9Wo,102 catalyst. It gave
the best selectivity to 1,2-PDO, followed by the SiO2 (Entry 9) and TiO2 (Entry 2) supported
catalysts. Nevertheless, the conversions in these cases (Entries 1 and 9) were below 10%. It has
been reported that to achieve good 1,2-PDO selectivity the presence of moderate strength of Lewis
acidity is required [36]. Based on that hypothesis, SiOz has widely been used as a support for this
reaction. For example, RuRe/SiQ2 catalyst gave an excellent 1,2-PDO selectivity [37]. In this case,
the bifunctional nature of the catalyst having both Re oxide (acidic sites) to the Ru metal sites
resulted in the excellent activity and selectivity (51% of conversion and 25% selectivity), however,
with a high metal loading (9 wt.%). In our system, at low conversion levels (ca. 15%), figure 2c
