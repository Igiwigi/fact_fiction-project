sometimes from academia, but not from civil society. These processes and committees have 14
been appointed or nominated unilaterally, with no open call for participation. This risk making : _
social and ethical considerations far more removed from the crux of discussions, whereas an 4
approach towards AI that imbibes these considerations by design is far more sustainable. This 7s
also runs the risk of limiting the effectiveness and reach of AI policy in India, given that the AI : S
ecosystem is complex, intertwined, and based on collaboration and partnership between different :&

stakeholders [25].

Fourth, the limits of automated processing and technological solutions to solve systemic and
societal problems are often left completely unconsidered. The potential risks and limitations of
data-driven decision-making, and their ethical and social impacts needs to be reconfigured into
a central consideration in India’s AI policy development. The fact that a decision is ‘data-driven’
does not mean it is fair, just, accurate, or appropriate. This will be further elaborated on in the
next section.

Fifth, while State use and adoption of AI for law enforcement, defence and national security is
on the rise, policy discussions thus far have neglected to confront the contours within which such
use should occur. Even in cases where national security is acknowledged, like the AI Task Force
Report, the responsibilities and limitations on state power are not discussed. The relationship
between individuals and the state, and the corresponding effects of AI on the exercise of rights
needs more transparency and critical debate.
