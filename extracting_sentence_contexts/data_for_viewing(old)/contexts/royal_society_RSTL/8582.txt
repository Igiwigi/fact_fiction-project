defined, extending seaward about 5 miles.

Mr. Trovenrox states that the sounds of this day were very inferior to those of the

Since the publication of the first notices of this investigation various communications

of Fulham, has written to me with a circumstantiality which leaves no room for doubt
that he has heard the Portland guns at a distance of 44 miles through a dense fog.

The Duke of ARGYLL has also fayoured me with the following very interesting account
of his own experience. Coming. as it does from a disciplined scientific observer, it is
particularly valuable. © This fact” (the permeability of fog by sound) © I have long
