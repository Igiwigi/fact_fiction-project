47-50, 55, Plates 47, 48). The substance of the incoming fibre,
however, hardly takes basic stains at all, and even after precipitation of the proteins
contains only a few relatively large granules. In fact the incoming fibre appears to
have a very much smaller protein content than the outgoing fibre, and much less of
the acidic material. Some comment has already been made upon the gradation in
amount of acidic material (and perhaps of total protein) which occurs along the length
of the giant fibres (Young 1937). Whatever may be the functional significance of this
gradation, it shows decisively that the substances of the two axons do not mingle at
the synapse.
