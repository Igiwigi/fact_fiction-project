tive velocity between. Assuming ¢ = 27s7!, k = 27/130cm7!, h = 36cm and a = 3cm we
find that the theoretical velocity just in the interior of the fluid, according to equation (255),
is 0-45cm/s, in good agreement with the observation at the lowest level. The velocity
gradient near the free surface was not recorded; the theoretical value given by equation
(276) is —0-56s~!, compared with a mean value of —0-02s~! between the two observations
nearest the upper surface. Caligny, however, mentions that the observations at the upper-
most levels were rather scattered. This might either be because the motion was not steady,
or because the velocity gradient was so large that the velocity depended critically on the
depth of the particle of resin below the free surface.

In some previous but less precise experiments (1861) Caligny had observed a backward
movement of grains of sand and resin on the bottom. But this movement diminished
rapidly with distance from the wave maker and seems to have been due to the fact that
locally the waves were not progressive.

Mitchim (1939)

A systematic experimental study of deep-water waves was made by Mitchim (1939) using
a tank 60ft. long, 1ft. wide and 3 ft. deep. The depth of water was 2-5 ft., and the wave-
lengths investigated were from 2 to 5 ft., or less than twice the depth of water; thus the waves
were, effectively, in deep water. The motion was generated at one end of the tank by
a wooden flap hinged on the bottom, and was dissipated at the far end on a sloping plane
beach. The mass-transport velocities below the free surface were measured by photographing
the tracks of white liquid particles suspended in the fluid; the velocities at the surface were
measured by observing the progress of a small wooden cylinder 4; in. in diameter.
