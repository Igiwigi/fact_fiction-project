While we cannot guarantee that engineering graduates will be good
citizens and/or will not make any fatal mistakes while carrying out their duties, we can
at least ensure that the graduates have achieved graduate-skills at a suitable standard. In
the same manner that human learning continues on the job, through training, monitoring,
and feedback; humans specialized in ME can certify an AIAS according to a standard of
performance and competency. P7 Enables the deployment of context independent systems Transfer learning [39] is successful
on limited problems; possibly due to the fact that the AI was trained rather than educated. ME offers the possibility that by structuring the body of knowledge for the AI, and
teaching an AI this body of knowledge through direct injection of knowledge and/or
data-driven ML, the AI is able to bootstrap [40] from its existing knowledge as it moves
to novel contexts that it has not encountered before. This characteristic stems from the
epistemological difference between training and education, where the latter empowers a
cognitive agent with the common body of knowledge required to develop competencies
on a variety of problem classes.
