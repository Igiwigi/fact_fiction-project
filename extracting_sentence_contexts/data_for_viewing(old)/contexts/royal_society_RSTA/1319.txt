Figure 10. The dimensionless supercooling w versus the dimensionless time t (a). The dimensionless particle-volume
distribution function F versus the dimensionless volume of crystals z; = z at a fixed value of time t = 0.021. The curves are
plotted for ellipsoidal and spherical crystals with allowance for the Meirs nucleation kinetics. The physical parameters used in
calculations correspond to figure 3 and p = 2.1. (Online version in colour.)

is explained by the fact that crystals evolve and compensate the melt supercooling so that already
existing particles continue their gradual growth, and the appearance of new crystals is inhibited
by partially removed supercooling. In addition, the distribution function for ellipsoidal crystals
is lower than for spherical particles at the same values of modified time variable x1.

Eliminating the modified time x; by means of expression (4.7) (see also figure 8b), we
demonstrate in figure 10 the dimensionless supercooling and distribution function depending
on real dimensionless variables t and z;. As can be easily seen from figure 10a, supercooling is
removed faster in the case of the growth of ellipsoidal crystals in comparison with the evolution
of spherical particles. As in the previous section, this is explained by the fact that ellipsoidal
particles (of the same volume as spherical particles) have a larger surface area and, therefore,
they release the larger latent heat of crystallization, which leads to faster removal of supercooling.
This circumstance directly affects the distribution function shown in figure 10b at a fixed time t.
