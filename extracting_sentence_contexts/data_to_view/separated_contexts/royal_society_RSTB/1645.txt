The strip of organ was now carefully divided across the middle of its length, the
electrodes being left untouched. This operation left the head end of the strip alone
in connection with the stimulated nerve, and thus diminished to about one half the
number of elements (electric plates) supplied by the excited nerve. A series of
theotome observations were now made, and as the object was to compare the general
magnitude of the response of the shorter with that of the whole strip, the closing time
was altered back to 001 second, and the whole experiment carried out precisely like
those given in the first chart with which it is to be compared.

The above is an illustration of the familiar fact that the intensity of the electrical
response varies directly with the number of elements thrown into activity.*
If it is compared with those in the first chart, it is evident that the primary initial
effect commences in the same way, and subsides in the same way, but that its
intensity is decreased to a little less than one half. Section 2.—Haperiments on Irreciprocal Resistance. As in the case of Torpedot and of Raia batis,t it was found that strips cut from
the isolated organ respond to the passage of an electrical current through their
substance.
