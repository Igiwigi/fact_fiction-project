down in the investigations of the influence of nitrogen on the growth of plants, but
also enable us to trace this important element to its source,

By what mysterious process of natural chemistry the living principle of the plant
obtains this product, we must be content to remain ignorant; but to what extent a
supply can be procured from the compounds upon which its agency is directed, is
within the compass of legitimate experimental research.

With respect to the entire volume of nitrogen connected with the process of vege-
tation, it will be observed that my former Tables show that the quantity appropriated
by the plant varies from +5 to + of their weight of carbon ; and the important ex-
periments of Dr. Dausexy, SaussURE, Sir Humenry Davy and others, have abun-
dantly established the fact that there is a considerable evolution of nitrogen during
the growth of plants. Experiments, however, upon the quantity of nitrogen evolved
are 80 beset with difficulties, that our best efforts in this department of vegetable phy-
siology have not enabled us to speak with certainty as to the absolute or relative
quantities of the gases which are given off during the healthy action of the functions
of vegetable life. And in corroboration of this remark it is only necessary to state,
that the natural course of vegetation is unavoidably interrupted, by the necessity we
are under of excluding plants from the free action of the external atmosphere, when
we attempt to collect the gases they give off.

Sir Humenky Davy made his experiments under as favourable circumstances as
the nature of the case will admit of; and he found that when the oxygen decreased
in quantity about two per cent. the nitrogen increased four per cent., and that when
