cavities, one of them being very large (Plate 7, fig. 42, tm.c.). It has also shifted
caudally but only to a slight extent. Epithelial body IV lies on the dorsal side of the
thymus and appears as a small deeply staining mass with only a remnant of its lumen.

Remarks on Thymus 1V.—HamMaARk in his review (19, p. 208) points out that no
case is known of the constant occurrence of a thymus IV amongst the Mammalia, and
goes on to remark “da ganze Siiugerordnungen diesbeziiglich unerforscht sind, ist
allerdings die Méglichkeit zurzeit nicht ausgeschlossen, dass es wirklich Siiuger mit
konstant dimetamerem Thymus-Typus gibt.” That possibility is now seen to be
realised in Trichosurus, which thus acquires the distinction of being the first mammal
to be described in which thymus IIT and thymus IV are constantly present.

The fact that thymus IV may occur amongst the Eutheria appears to have been
first definitely established by GroscHurr(13) in a paper published in 1896. He
stated that it occurs constantly in the Calf and Cat, occasionally in the Sheep, as traces
in the Horse and Goat and he inferred its presence in Man. In a later paper (14) he
corrects his former statement in regard to its constancy in the Calf and Cat and states
that it is not of constant occurrence in any mammal but is to be regarded only as
more or less frequent in those mammals which possess an epithelial body IV.
GroscHurr showed that the small masses of thymus tissue associated with an
epithelial body which had been observed by Kon (29) and others imbedded in the
lateral lobes of the thyroid in the Cat, Dog, and Rat, and which were distinguished by
Koun as ‘inner thymus-lobes,” really represent thymus IV which has become
secondarily included in the same along with epithelial body IV through the inter-
mediation of the ultimobranchial body.
