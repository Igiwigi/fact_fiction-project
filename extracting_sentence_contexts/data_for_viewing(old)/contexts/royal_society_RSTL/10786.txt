ON THE THICKNESS AND SURFACE TENSTON OF LIQUID FILMS, 683

This 8upposition is als0 less satisfactory than the last, inasmuch as the equilibrium
would be nnstable. An accidental thinning below Q' would produce rupture. The
fact that this does not occur at once might be explained by supposing that the snrface
viscosity would play a more important part as the film became thinner,

We need hardly point out that the best way of attempting to test such theories
would be to measure the surface tension of a grey film. Unfortunately, however,
81ch a film can only be obtained when the electric current is passing, and the very
fact that the grey displays itself is a proof that changes in the snrface are going on
which may complicate the conclusions to be drawn from the experiment.

We have frequently tried to secure satisfactory observations of this kind, but have
not succeeded in obtaining any in which we could with certainty discriminate between
the possible effects of the renewal of the surface and a real change in surface tension
due to a change in the thickness. Experiments XX. to XXIIL are the only observa-
tions we have made in which an apparent change of sur≈øace tension could not be
accounted for by the change of surface. In these observations, however, the latter
cause would have produced a contraction instead of a bulging of the black film, and
they cannot therefore be set down as particular cases of the phenomenon studied in
the earlier part of the paper.
