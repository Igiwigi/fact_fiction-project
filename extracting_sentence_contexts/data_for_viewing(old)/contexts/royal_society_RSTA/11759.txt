force. This paper may be considered as an attempt to take a step beyond MaxweELt’s
analytical theory, and to give a sort of material representation of the mechanism of
the electromagnetic field.

The result’ of all these investigations is that while the electric force due to a moving
point-charge is still radial, the intensity of the force, for a given distance from the
charge, gradually increases as the radius vector turns from the direction of motion to
a perpendicular direction. There is also a distribution of magnetic force, in which
the lines of force are circles centred on the axis of motion, the planes of the circles
being perpendicular thereto.

The fact that the electric force is radial led Mr, Heavisrpe to form the conclusion
that the ‘expression for the electric force due to a point-charge is the same as that due
to a charged sphere in motion carrying an equal charge, the distribution on the
sphere being such that o = KE,/47, where E, is the electric force normal to the sur-
face which would be due to the point-charge placed at the centre of the sphere. But
the surface which gives rise’to a field the same as that due to a point-charge is an
ellipsoid of revolution, whose minor axis, which is also the axis of figure, lies along
the direction of motion, and whose axes are in the ratios 1 : 1 :(1 — w*/v*)!, where w is
the velocity of the point and v is the velocity of light through the dielectric.* The
charge is distributed in the same way as if the ellipsoid were statically charged, i.e.,
the surface density is proportioned to the perpendicular from the centre on the
tangent plane. This surface I call the “ Heaviside ” ellipsoid.
