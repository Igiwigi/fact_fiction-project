To be quite specific suppose that

ee a a 4,6 Sra ay a — 9

With these values the system is quite stable so long as the radius is less than about 2. Near
this point, however, the harmonics of degree 1 begin to develop and a pattern of form (12-5)
with my) = 1 makes its appearance. Making use of the facts that

P%(cos#) = cos#, Pi(cos#) = Py! (cos@) = sin#,
it is seen that XY —A is of the form
X—h = Acos+Bsin@ cosd+Csin@ sing, (12-6)

which may also be interpreted as

X—h= A’ cos’, (12-7)
where 0’ is the angle which the radius #, 6 makes with the fixed direction having direction
cosines proportional to B, C, A and A’ = ,/(A?+ B?+C?). The outcome of the analysis therefore is quite simply this. Under certain not very
restrictive conditions (which include a requirement that the sphere be relatively small but
increasing in size) the pattern of the breakdown of homogeneity is axially symmetrical, not
about the original axis of spherical polar co-ordinates, but about some new axis determined
by the disturbing influences.
