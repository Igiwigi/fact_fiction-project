We suggest that conditional Y is 100%. If learnersâ€™ sensitivity to conditional probability

and distributional statistical learning are deeply linked, both arises from their computation of transitional probability,


their confidence in grouping X and Y should be equivalent in
these two cases (as the transitional probability between X and
Y is identical in both cases). But in fact, learners have a stron-
ger expectation that X and Y will co-occur as they see the
grouping more frequently [89]. This sensitivity to frequency
falls naturally out of a memory-based perspective, given the
important role of repetition in memory (e.g. [90]). Second, transitional probabilities are insensitive to the
order in which information is presented.
