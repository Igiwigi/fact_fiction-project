This is partially because collective
movements are frequently depicted as originating from one
individual (the leader, or decision-maker) initiating move-
ment. We argue that this is an oversimplification that limits
our understanding of the potentially delicate interaction
between personality and leadership. That leadership can, in
fact, be distributed among several group members during
collective movement has been demonstrated in various taxa
(see [25] for a review). The extent to which individual person-
ality traits influence ranks in such more complex, distributed
leadership networks remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used flocks of homing pigeons, Columba
livia, to investigate the relationship between personality and
influence on collective movement.
