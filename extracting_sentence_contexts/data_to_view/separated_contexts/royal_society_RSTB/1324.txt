V. Extrepation oF THE Mippie Lose or THE CEREBELLUM,

In removing the middle lobe of the cerebellum, in order to study the degenerations
which follow such a lesion, I was always careful to avoid removing any of the latera
lobe on one or both sides. In fact, I preferred to leave a little of the middle lobe,
bordering on the lateral, rather than injure the lateral lobe in my operation. In orde
to be still more certain that the degenerations I found were consequent on destructio!
of the middle lobe, and not due to any injury of the lateral lobes, I removed sm
portions of the middle lobe, in some cases, in which procedure there could be n√©
possibility of the lateral lobes being injured. I therefore feel confident that th
degenerations I am about to describe are due to destruction of the middle lobe, ane
not to any implication of the lateral lobes in the lesion.
