In contrast, the
solutions presented here change their peak amplitudes rather than their width. These amplitude
variations are extreme. In fact, this specific type of evolution with sharp peaks requires special
care in numerical procedures.

3. Pulsating solitons with extreme spikes

Extreme pulsations, observed firstly in the normal dispersion regime, are characterized by narrow
spikes developed on top of a roughly stationary soliton that serves as a pedestal supporting these
