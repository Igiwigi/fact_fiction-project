Note that y{?, 4-y2), represents the éofal correction which must be added, for
2(n—1) b<t<2nb,

to the expression for the potential previously valid for t<2(n—1) 6. The potential at all
points both inside and outside the channel is, in fact, represented by the series

b= SVP, (45)

where y, = F,, but, for n>2, y, is not the diffracted wave. This has yet to be obtained from y,,,.

In the general discussion of the diffraction effects at the open end, it was predicted that
any wave, say ’, emanating from the lower lip, would propagate unchanged in the region

—4n<0 <1, and would be totally reflected inside the channel (—17<4< —4n). It follows
