foliage leaves being in all essential points similar to the sporophylls. An @
nation of the leaves about the limits of these zones shows that in the axils 0
apparently sterile, a more or less completely arrested sporangium is commonly |
found, so that the transition from the one to the other is a gradual one, The
fact, so easily observed in this species, is found also to hold for others,
importance will be brought out more prominently on a later page (p. 535).

Results from study of L. Selago. L.

e chief facts regarding the development of the sporangium in L. Selago may be

sarised as follows :â€”

The sporangium originates at the base of the sporophyll, as a transversely

ded cushion, consisting of many cells, arranged without strict regularity.

| archesporium consists of one row of hypodermal cells, six or more in

er, which give rise to the whole of the sporogenous mass.

Be tapetum is derived partly from the primitive wall of the sporangium (from
