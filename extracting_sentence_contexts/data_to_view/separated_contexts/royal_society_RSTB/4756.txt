pretty certain (Plate 10, fig. 2) that the glomeruli are in fact supplied in large part, if
not entirely, from this source. Whether branches of the aorta also take part in the
vascularisation of the kidney, I am not sure; 1 can only
say that 1 was not able to trace any of the small aortic
segmental branches into the substance of the kidney, and
am inclined to think that the arterial blood supply has been
mainly, if not entirely, transferred from the aorta to the
lower lateral cutaneous artery. From the above it will be seen that the circulation of the
trunk and kidneys normally carried on by the aorta,
posterior cardinals and lateral vessels, has undergone very
profound modification and has been to a large extent
transferred from these vessels to a system of subcutaneous
arteries and veins and vascular plexuses, with the result
that the vessels by which this circulation is usually carried on
are much reduced, or even completely lost (e.g., posterior
