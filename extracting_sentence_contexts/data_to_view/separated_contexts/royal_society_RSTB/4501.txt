The view that the gonads among Termite soldiers have undergone
an arrestation of development is also held by PÃ©rez but is not accepted by Hearn
(1902, p. 62). In Archotermopsis the genital organs in the soldier caste normally
attain as high a degree of development as oecurs in the winged sexual forms when the
latter are ready to leave the nest. This fact I have been able to prove by numerous
dissections. There is consequently, in this instance, no evidence in favour of the
theory of arrested development, and a study of their histology points to the probability
of their frequently being functional organs. These remarks also apply to Termopsis
angusticollis, three soldiers of which have been recorded by Hearu (1902, p. 59) as
laying fertile ova.
