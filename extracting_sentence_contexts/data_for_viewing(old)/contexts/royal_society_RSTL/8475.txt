where U, U', V, V' are quartic functions of , Þ; that is the ratio «: 4 has four values,
and to each of these there corresponds a single value of Q; viz. Q is determined by a
quartic equation.

14. Considering next the case n=5, the quintic transformation ; the elimination of Q
gives the equations

HEY W.

where U, U', &c. are all quadric functions of a, 3, y. We have thence 4:4 —2:2, =12
8ets of yalues of «:Þ:y; viz. considering «, Þ, y as coordinates in plano, the curves
UV'=U'V=0, UW'—U'W=0 are quartic curves intersecting in 16 points ; but among
these are included the four points U=0, U'=0 (in fact the point «=0, y4=0 four
times), which are not points of the curye VW'—V'W=0; there remain therefore 16 —4,
=12 intersections (agreeing with the general value (+1). 2*%-®). Hence Q is in the
first instance determined by an equation of the order 12; but the proper order being =6,
there must be a factor of the order 6 to be rejected. To explain this and determine the
factor, obserye that the equations in question are

Irl(2y +287 +8) —1(Zy +20 +8) =0,

Wa(a+2Þ) —Y(y +28) =0;
