reservoir, mobilized from this subsolidus region and incorporated into the erupted magma body [3
within a few centuries of eruption. Overall, the data from crystal cargo in dacitic to rhyolitic rocks 12

suggests remarkably similar and relatively cold conditions of storage prior to eruptions across
intermediate to rhyolitic magma systems.
One note of caution is that the mixing-to-eruption time scales for mafic systems discussed

above tend to be shorter than the centuries to millennia of reactivation of near-solidus bodies : 3
to produce intermediate or silicic eruptions, and it is possible that mafic magma reservoir SS
systems are on average hotter than more evolved systems. Although mixing-to-eruption times :B
are typically short, it is still possible that the crystals in mafic magmas include cores that had :F
protracted storage in lower-temperature regions of the reservoir. In fact, some crystals in mafic : a
systems do show evidence for derivation from a crystal mush, implying relatively cold storage : =
and rapid remobilization (e.g. [73-76]), or perhaps endogenous development of a crystal mush : =
within a sill over a period of months prior to remobilization [48]. More data are needed in order to 1B
test whether mush storage (whether protracted or brief) is generally the case for crystals in mafic : =
systems, and if so to better understand the implications for the long-term thermal conditions in ZR
these reservoirs. Whatever the eventual result of a comprehensive study of the thermal conditions : o
of magma storage across magma compositions, it is clear that combining different types of : ~
data (e.g. crystallization ages with crystallization temperatures and with constraints on thermal :3
histories from diffusion durations) can be a powerful tool to understand the thermal history of : Ss

exciting avenue for future research.
