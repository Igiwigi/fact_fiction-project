same coincidence has to be assumed for the series VI. and VII. There is, further, the
analogy with carbon dioxide, in which case there is no room for doubt as to the
variability of the specific heat. In the case of hydrogen it will subsequently be seen
there is also very certain variability of the specific heat, but in the opposite direction ;
that is, while in the case of air and carbon dioxide the specific heat increases with
increasing density, in the case of hydrogen it diminishes. Now this for all three
gases agrees with their behaviour as regards Boyur’s law at the pressures covered by
the experiments. It is well known that in the case of air and carbon dioxide the
imperfectness of the gases is revealed by departures from Boyte’s law, small in the
one ease, large in the other, but in the opposite direction to that which is apparent in
the case of hydrogen, whose deviation from the law is, as in the case of air, small.

These facts, taken together, are, I think, a strong confirmation of the reality of the

variation observed in the experiments on air. For if there is no corresponding reality
to the variation shown by nearly all the experiments on air, it is necessary to suppose
some source of error varying in the one direction with the pressure. Considered now
in connection with the other two gases it is necessary to suppose this error increasing
in intensity for the more imperfect gas and reversed in direction for the super-
