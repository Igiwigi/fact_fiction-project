fish, and that the operculum is the large lateral area of the head, containing the
plates L? and L’ of Brom. The structure of the neural cranium, so far as it is known
in Asterosteus and Jagorina, is consistent with this view. It is impossible to determine

“how far ventrally the slit behind the operculum extended; it seems however most
probable that it terminated immediately behind the anterior border of the anterior
lateral, the external surface of the operculum and the shoulder there becoming
continuous.

Inspection of the published photographs shows that, apart from proportional changes
due to crushing and to those which may depend on growth, the extent to which the
head (including the lower jaw) is prolonged in front of the anterior lateral is variable.
As Brortthas shown the mouth faces dorsally, being in fact most reminiscent of that of
an Angler fish Lophius. As the centre of the upper jaw is clearly fixed by association
with the anterior end of the neural cranium, it is evident that the mouth can only be
opened by a protrusion of the lower jaw, and the specimens show that this forward
thrust did occur, and that it was associated, as on mechanical grounds it must have
been, with a lateral contraction of the mouth. It seems probable that only the “spitz
rhombischen Tafelchen” with their stellate tubercles were attached to the lower jaw,
and that the “‘spitzen stachelzahnen” were really carried by the antero-posteriorly
widened admesial end of the hyoid.
