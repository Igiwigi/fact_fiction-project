on an element of the fluid could be represented by a normal pressure, which James Jeans
characterized as, ‘an abstract ideal which is logically inconsistent with the molecular constitution
of matter postulated by the Kinetic Theory’ [65, p. 29]. At other times the same assumptions were
made for physical or theological objectives, such as ensuring the permanence of atoms, but ran
into mathematical problems, as in Kelvin and Tait’s attempts to apply Lagrange’s equations of
motion to vortices.

Osborne Reynolds was clear that the origin of the tensions lay in the impossible attempt to
match abstract theory with reality. The fluid dynamicist,


has to begin by apologising for his fundamental assumptions as being obviously contrary to
facts, and after carrying his readers through most difficult and complex mathematics, he has
again to apologise for his conclusions, which are in general contrary to experience... The
only real success, has been obtained by the rigorous development of the theory of the
motions in a perfect fluid... regardless of whether or not these motions take place in actual
fluids [58, p. 343].

Vortex atom theory in Britain was pursued by an elite group of Cambridge-trained
mathematicians and physicists. It provided a theological and physical context for exploiting their
own mathematical training, and a means of exerting authority over less mathematically-trained
physicists. But ultimately, they were unable to resolve what MacAlister deemed the, ‘true paradox
that one must be something of a mathematician to understand what a real theory the Vortex-theory
is’ [53, p. 279 MacAlister’s emphasis].
