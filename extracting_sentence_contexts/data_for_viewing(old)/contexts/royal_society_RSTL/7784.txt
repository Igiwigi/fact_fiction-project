specific gravity 1:188, contained traces only of sulphuric, hydrochloric, or hydrofluosilicic
acids, or of fixed matter. And an eighth sample, from Mr. WiLL1ax Corus, Sheffield,
of specific gravity 1:248, contained no sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, and left only a
trace of solid residue on evaporation to dryness: by neutralization with ammonia, 1:70
per cent. of fixed matter was obtained after washing and ignition ; this fixed matter
contained 1-46 part of $i O,>=3:5 per cent. of 2HF, S$iF, in the acid; the fixed matter
also contained iron, &. A second sample, weighing twelve pounds, from the same
maker gave 723 grains of sulphur by treatment with excess of sulphuretted hydrogen.
All the samples contained large but variable amounts of sulphurous acid, and gave
copious deposits of sulphur &e. by treatment with excess of sulphuretted hydrogen ;
they also contained yery variable percentages of HF, varying from about 10 to 70. Oil
of vitriol is sometimes added to weak hydrofluoric acid to enable it to etch glass in a
Suitable manner ; it imparts to it a fictitious strength, probably by abstraction of water.
A ixty per cent. acid requires dilution before it can be used for etching glass; too
strong an acid etches glass roughly. An acid of 70 per cent., and containing 5:76 per
cent. of H, SO,, instantly converted filtering-paper into a jelly at 60* Fan. ; it was too
strong for retention in gutta-percha bottles.

A $mall gutta-percha jug of the annexed form was sometimes employed for Fig. 14.
taking the specific gravities of samples of weak acid. The neck of the vessel was
less than half an inch internal diameter, and was closed by placing a gutta-percha
ball with a handle loosely in it. Any excess of liquid above the ball was absorbed
by application of sponge previous to weighing.

Sulphurous acid is frequently present im commercial hydrofluoric acid to such an
