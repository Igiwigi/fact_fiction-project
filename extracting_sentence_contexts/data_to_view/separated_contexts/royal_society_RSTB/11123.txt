The
earlier lower estimates of family-based heritability, 30-40%,
are not cited in this meta-analysis. Falconer & Mackay [49]
point out that the use of i? relies on the environmental com-
ponents of variance in MZ and DZ twins being the same. In
fact, they go on to list [49, pp. 172-173] seven ways in which
a difference in these environmental components could be pro-
duced. Not included among these seven are differences in
cultural transmission, either vertical or horizontal, that can
affect MZ and DZ twins differently [28], for example, due to
parents actively trying to treat each member of an MZ twin
pair differently, or peers treating MZ twins differently from
DZ twins. As has been pointed out many times [44,50,51], Pol-
derman ef al.’s estimate of 49% ‘across all traits’ does not, as they
claim, tell us about ‘the causes of individual differences in
human traits’ nor will it ‘guide future gene-mapping efforts.’
That is, heritability in general does not imply a genetic causal
mechanism.
