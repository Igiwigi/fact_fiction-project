known previously only from sediments of Richmond age,* that Ligonodina was not
previously known from any formations older than Middle Silurian (but is now also
described on p. 306 from both the Gelli-grin and Pen-y-garnedd Limestones), and that
Amorphognathus was not known from formations older than the Trenton.

(iv) Further reference to Ellisonâ€™s paper will show that the following eleven genera
from the Plattin, Glenwood and Decorah Beds, none of which are present in the
Llandeilo fauna, are not known to occur above the Black River formation: Acontiodus,
Bryantodina, Cardiodella, Chirognathus, Curtognathus, Erismodus, Microcoelodus, Neocoleodus,
Oulodus, Stereoconus (since collected from the Pen-y-garnedd Limestone), Truchero-
gnathus.

(v) These facts tend to suggest that the Llandeilo Limestone fauna may be younger in
age than the three American faunas with which it has been compared above. If the
ranges of genera given by Ellison (1946) are accepted, the presence of Dichognathus and
Amorphognathus would limit its age to Trenton. It will be recalled, however, that only one
specimen of each of these genera was present in the Llandeilo.

(vi) The two species, Cordylodus rectilineatus and Cyrtoniodus complicatus, which are
abundant in the Llandeilo, are present in both the Decorah Shale and the Glenwood
Beds.

There are three possible explanations of the differences in the faunas of these four
formations. One, the possibility of the Llandeilo being later than the other three, has
been discussed above. It has already been mentioned that the Llandeilo conodont fauna
