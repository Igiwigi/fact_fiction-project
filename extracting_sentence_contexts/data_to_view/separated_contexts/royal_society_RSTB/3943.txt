Different cultures from one given fertilization always gave the same type of

inheritance. ' In addition to these reasons, our contention gains further support from the fact

that in not a single instance out of our numerous cultures during 1909-11 did the
type of inheritance show any change. If the inheritance in our larvee were of the
nature of that described by Tennent for Hippono√© and Toxopneustes, that is that it
can be influenced by some external condition, such as the reaction, salinity, and
temperature of the sea-water at the time of, or after fertilization, then it is remarkable
that in all these cultures, in many of which these conditions must have varied widely,
no stimulus should have been present capable of bringing about some change.
