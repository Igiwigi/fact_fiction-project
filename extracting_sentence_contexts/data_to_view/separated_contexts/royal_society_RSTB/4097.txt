Thus it is double for 17 mm.
out of 37 mm., or not much less than one-half of its length. At its anterior end (fig. 7) the vomer consists of two thin vertical plates of bone
applied to the sides of the median vertical ridge of the premaxilla. As we pass
backwards these two plates soon meet each other above the premaxilla, and fuse for
a short distance (fig. 6); above the level of this union the two lamin are again free,
or, to express the same fact otherwise, the dorsal border of the medial bone formed by
the union of the pair of laminz√© is grooved. At the same time the laming also extend
farther downwards, projecting into the substance of the premaxilla, and being very
closely gripped by it. From the base of the dorsal groove a delicate low median
lamina of bone projects upwards.
