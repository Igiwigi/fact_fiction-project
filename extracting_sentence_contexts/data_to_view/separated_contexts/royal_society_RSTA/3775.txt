This observation is of course not in any way at variance with the principle

derived from the direct-current energy supplied to it, the are acting as a converter. This fact, that the solid are is capable, under suitable conditions, of automatically
transforming energy derived from a source of direct current into alternate-current
energy of any frequency over a wide range, is the explanation of the transformation
of energy observed in the Musical Are recently shown for the first time at the

Effect of Varying the Direct Current. Having found that with a sufficiently high frequency it was possible to measure
the true resistance of the arc, this resistance was measured for ares of a fixed leneth
