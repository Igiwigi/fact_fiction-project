the existence of large, intermediate, and small types of soldiers on one and the same
species ; that nutrition causes these three forms to be sharply differentiated from one
another unconnected by any intermediate forms; that nutrition is likewise the
stimulus which results in the occurrence of large and small workers in the same
species ? Do such contentionists maintain that the profound changes in the morpho-
logy of the head, mandibles, labium, tentorium, and nervous system, which distinguish

nutrition ? Would upholders of this hypothesis further claim that dietary regime
will account for the total loss of wings in the sterile castes, and also for the fact that
in many species the members of those castes have lost all trace of eyes ?
Summarising the foregoing portion of this chapter, I maintain that there is no
satisfactory evidence conclusively proving that any particular type of nutrition, or the
absence thereof, is capable of producing such fundamental changes in the external
and internal morphology which characterise the soldier caste. It has also been shown
that the reduction in the gonads is not an invariable attribute of the soldier, and that
caste production is not in any way related to the presence of intestinal Protozoa. I
believe, therefore, in order to obtain a solution of the problem of Termite poly-
morphism, we must endeavour to discover whether it may, or may not, be due to a
more deeply-seated influence. Buenion has suggested (1912, p. 1094) that the
differentiation of the soldier caste is due to some fundamental cause analogous to that
which determines sex (special mode of fertilisation or special chromosomes). This
