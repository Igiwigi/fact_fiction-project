Figure 3. Raw signal DSC curves of carbonate glass sample KMG8 containing initially 0.24 wt% bulk H,0 show below 120°C an
artificial broad peak during specific heat recording (transition from isothermal conditions to a dynamic heating segment). The
individual DSC curves show how successive reheating through the glass transition region shifts the glass transition temperature
to higher values as a result of dehydration. (Online version in colour.)

cycles comprising excursions across the glass transition at a well-controlled heating rate, with the
heating rate matching to the prior cooling rate (10 K min“; [37]). With this approach of matching
cooling and heating rates, the so-called onset of the calorimetric glass transition (Tg, onset)
corresponds to the limiting fictive temperature (Tg, fictive: [14,38,39]. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate
that on successive reheating through the glass transition region, the glass transition temperature
is shifted to higher values until a final value is reached. This effect can be triggered either by
staying closely to the peak temperature for samples with initially low water contents (250°C for
sample KMG8; figure 3) or by successively heating up to a temperature where degassing occurs
ina single step (225°C for sample KMG9; figure 2). If the sample is completely degassed, the onset
of crystallization occurs at about 270°C.


Raw signal DSC curves on a diagram plotting (uV mg~') versus (uncorrected) temperature
generally show at temperatures below 120°C an artificial broad peak during specific heat (Cp)
recording, which relates to a transition from isothermal conditions at room temperature to the
dynamic heating segment of the DSC analysis (figure 3). In experiments with less than 4 wt% H20,
