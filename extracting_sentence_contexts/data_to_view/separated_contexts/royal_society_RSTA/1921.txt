ยง 8. Method of Observation of the Strain in
Celluloid. In view of the fact that the provisional theory of ยง 6
would not fit the observations we decided to observe
directly the actual strain in the celluloid, and an ex-
tensometer was devised to enable us to measure this. The ends of the celluloid specimen were securely
fastened in two clamps A and B (fig. 8), the upper
one being suspended from a fixed support, while the
lower could be loaded by means of a lever and weights.
