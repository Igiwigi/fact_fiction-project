(b) The nonlinear dynamics of sleep regulation

Three distinct processes underlie sleep regulation at a phenomenological
evel (for a recent review, see [50]): a homeostatic process, reflecting prior
uistory of sleep and wakefulness; a circadian process, based on cellular clock-
ike mechanisms; and an ultradian process, reflected by the cyclic alternation
of non-REM and REM sleep (on a time scale of minutes to hours in
yumans and minutes in rodents). The circadian and homeostatic processes were
formalized phenomenologically in the two-process model of sleep regulation
51,52]. According to this model, a homeostatic process (process S; relaxation
oscillator) and a circadian process (process C) interact to generate sleep-awake
patterns (on a time scale of hours to days in humans and minutes in rodents).
In recent years, more and more facts about the underlying neurophysiological
mechanisms have been uncovered by experimental work [53]. Based on these
findings, several attempts have been made to develop mathematical models
of the neural dynamics underlying sleep regulation. There the activity of the
specific neural populations involved in sleep regulation is modelled by coupled
nonlinear ordinary differential equations that can produce limit cycles, show
1ysteresis effects and undergo bifurcations. In this issue, Fleshner et al. [39]
concentrate on the interaction between the circadian and the homeostatic
regulatory mechanisms by modelling the neurotransmitter-mediated interactions
etween the corresponding neural populations, whereas Robinson et al. [40] focus
on the reaction of the regulatory dynamics to external influences, such as auditory
stimuli, sleep deprivation or caffeine.
