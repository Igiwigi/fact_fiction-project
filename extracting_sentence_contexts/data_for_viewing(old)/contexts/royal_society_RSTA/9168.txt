although it may be nearly so for several successive maxima if the order ishigh. The
successive separations of the maxima are therefore not identical, and there is also a
variation in their intensities. This effect could be calculated, but owing to the

difficulty of securing uniform illumination, such a calculation would be of no value.
If measurements of the pattern to a high order of accuracy are required, it must in the
first place be made “normal” in a manner subsequently explained. The variation in
distance apart of the maxima is, in fact, in the present experiments, very small, as
will appear from the measurements, and a high degree of accuracy could have been
obtained by neglecting it.
The most important linear magnitude in the pattern, when it is obtained for two
spectrum lines close together, whose separation is to be deduced, is, of course, the
- difference of wave-length corresponding to the distance between successive orders.
Variations in D can be allowed for by making the pattern normal, and we may treat
D as constant in the present theoretical investigation. Its value is

D = 2ud cos v,
