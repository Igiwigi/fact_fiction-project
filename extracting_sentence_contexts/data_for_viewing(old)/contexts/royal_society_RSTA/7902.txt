makes it almost inevitable that the total solvation must increase with the activity of
the acetone. It is possible to account for the observed facts only by supposing that
in addition to the acetone some water must be absorbed. This absorption of water
can hardly be continuous throughout the whole range of acetone concentration but
must begin or at least become much more marked at the solution point.

The idea that the apparent sorption of acetone, as determined in this way, was the
effect of the attachment of water and acetone separately, say, the acetone on the nitro-
groups and the water on the hydroxyl groups, was considered at one time. Two
smooth curves of similar shape could be postulated, which when combined would give
an apparent acetone solvation rising to a maximum at the compatibility point, and
then falling to zero at 100°% acetone. That this is not a true explanation is shown
by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated from two continuous separate sorption
curves would always be continuous. Any theory of the sorption curve must therefore
explain the discontinuity. The solution of nitrocotton is apparently a continuous
process, but there is some change in the mechanism of solvation which begins when
the nitrocotton goes into solution. Bearing this in mind we may proceed to a hypothesis
which will explain the observed facts, particularly the second principal result. One
supposes that below the solution point water is not appreciably attached to nitrocotton.
In the act of solution the nitrocotton molecules surrounded by absorbed acetone
separate from each other. If the solution is dilute, }°% or less, each solvated molecule

will not interfere much with its neighbours and the solvation will rise as the activity
rises without any break being seen at the solution point. This is in accord with the
facts because, as has already been noted, the solvation has been found to rise with
