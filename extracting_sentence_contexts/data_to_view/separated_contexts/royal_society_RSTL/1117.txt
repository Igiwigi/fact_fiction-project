The exact resemblance'between our inland fagades (on the
east and west sides of ourarea/)'to those on the shore, proves
them tobe all effects from the same cause, and that our accu-
mulated strata have in all these similar instances been cut
down vertically by the same agent, and that this agent was
not the sea. Nor has this powerful agent confined its operations to our
coast, or tothe periphery of our basaltic area ; we-can trace
it over its whole surface.; we find throughout its interior, simi-
lar, though very diminutive abruptions, executed precisely in
the same manner, that is, strata cut across by a long vertical
facade, their planes on the upper side perfectly undisturbed,
while on the lower side all the materials of which that part of
the stratum was. once composed are completely carried off, —
(See 6th fact.)

We are now unavoidably led into a discussion of a question
which has at all times occupied the attention of naturalists.


v8 Dr. Ridfikiips08”s Letter on the basatti: Surface
Whence\arise «the Tnequatlilies with which the Surface of the
Earthis' $0:exceedingly diversified?. «;

I shall not attempt to encounter this question""generally,
nor to extend my enquiries' beyond the limits I have pre-
scribed to myself; but I shall try whether' the curious facts
so profusely exhibited over our basaltic area, throw any light
upon the formation of our own inequalities, or lead us a step
towards the discovery of the operations by which such stu-
pendous effects have been produced. Some to escape the difficulties in which this question is
involved, ascribe our inequalities to original formation ; as if
the world had come from the hand of the Creator withithe
variegated surface which now contributes 0 much” to its
beauty ; but the frequent interruptions; and resumptions of the
Strata in our area, with the perfect resemblance of the corres-
ponding parts, however great the mterval by which they are
separated, can' scarcely leave a'doubt that these strata were at
first 'continuous ; of course, the figure of our surface at: that
time must have depended on the original positions and incli-
nations of 'these strata, which, as appears by the-gd fact; are
now unconnected with the superficial line, the figure of which
is governed hy their abruptions and removals alone. Naturalists have differed much in opinion as to the direc-
tion in which the causes acted that produced the inequalities
on the surface of our globe ; some referring us to the bowels
of the” earth as to the scene of action ; while others assert
that the operations were performed upon the surface itself.
