Finally, the leader—follower interaction is described for
every agent from the leaders’ group, thus in general we have

(3.5)

wae =
v=,

w™ =w +aS(w,d)(5 — w) + me

where, similar to the previous dynamic, 6 is a random variable with zero mean and finite variance
6? and0<D(.) <1. Since we are dealing with a kinetic problem in which the variable belongs to a bounded
domain, namely I=[-—1,1], we must deal with additional mathematical difficulties in the
definition of the agents’ interactions. In fact, it is essential to consider only interactions that do
not produce values outside the finite interval. For the leaders’ interaction if we consider the constrained binary interactions system (3.1)—
(2.11), without diffusion we obtain that |* — 0*| is a contraction if a < 3

\o* — 0*| =|(@ — 3) — aw — 5)(R@, d) + REG, W))| <1 — 2a — dj. The following proposition gives sufficient conditions to preserve the bounds for the leaders’
interactions (3.1).
