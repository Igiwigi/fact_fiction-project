It has been seen that in the development of Molgula there is a correlation between
the formation of a larval sense organ, otolith alone in this case, and the presence of a
tail. In no case is the one known to be present without the other.* This can mean
one of two things. Hither the formation of an otolith is directly dependent upon the
development of a tail, i.e, the tail or some region or activity thereof acts as a
“ organiser,” or else in every case where the tailed larva has been suppressed the otolith
has disappeared through disuse.

The absence of the otolith in all anural Molgulid larve in spite of the polyphyletic
origin of the latter and its presence in every other case, whether the tadpole possess a
prolonged free-swimming period or not, suggests that the correlation is ontogenetic.
This is supported by the fact that such sense organs are present in all ascidian larvae
that bear tails, and are absent, in addition to the anural Molgulids, in all ascidiozoids
produced by budding, whether from the adult as in Stolonica socialis or in the tailed
tadpole as in Diplosoma. In this last the zooid connected directly with the tail and
controlling its movements possesses both an eye and an otolith; the zooid connected
with the tail only indirectly by way of the visceral mass of the other possesses no sense
organs. Finally, in Salpa and Pyrosoma, both anural forms, no larval sense organs
