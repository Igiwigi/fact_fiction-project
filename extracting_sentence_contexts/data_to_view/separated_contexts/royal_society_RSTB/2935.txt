That the bundles cling
very closely to the outside angle of the sinus (see phots. 6 and 9 and fig. 20) seems
& to be due to the fact that in this region, as in the body of the seed, they have
suffered a centripetal displacement. No section, however, has passed through our
hands in which the bundles at this height are seen lying in situ, though in the
specimen U. C. L., R. 6, Â¢ (fig. 30, v.b.) their position is probably not far from that
which they occupied in the living seed.
