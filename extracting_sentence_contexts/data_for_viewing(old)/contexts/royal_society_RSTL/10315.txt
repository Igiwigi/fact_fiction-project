AND EUPHAUSIA, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DECAPOD ZofA AND THE
CruUsTACEAN NAUPLIUS.

A STUDY IN MORPHOLOGY. 109

The general significance of the peculiar type of Decapod metamorphosis, of which
Tneifer is now the most thoroughly known illustration, has been discussed with the
greatest ability and knowledge of the facts by Cavs in his © Untersuchungen zur
Erforschung der Genealogischen Grundlage des Crustacean-Systems.” My own ac-
quaintance with the phenomena of Crustacean morphology in general is very far from

a work; but while the facts in the life-history of Lucifer seem to tend to a similar con-
5 clusion, and even to place it upon a much firmer basis than before, they also indicate
