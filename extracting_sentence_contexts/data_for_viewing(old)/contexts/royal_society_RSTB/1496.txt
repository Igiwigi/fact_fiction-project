immaturity of the ova and sperma is apparently the only cause to account for the
remainder of the decrease in size of the larvee, Thus, during these summer month
the ovaries and testes were frequently much diminished in size, and yielded no oy
or spermatozoa at all on shaking in water. Even the least affected ovaries seemed
contain a much smaller proportion of fertilisable ova than in the normal breeding
season. The curve shows very distinctly the variability in the maturity of the indi-
vidual sea-urchins. Thus, the larvee of the fertilisation on June 4th are 10°3 per cen|
smaller than those of May 29th; those of June 29th are 16°5 per cent. smaller than
those of June 22nd; and those of August 25th are 14 per cent. smaller than those of
September 14th. With regard to the comparative maturity at various months of the
year, the curve shows it to be more or less constant during April and May, but
decrease rapidly through June and July, till it reaches a minimum about the middle of
August. From this time it begins to increase very rapidly, much more rapidly, in fact,
than it had decreased during June and July, till, by the beginning of October, it he
reached the level it occupied in April and May.

As the effect of maturity is so marked in the sea-urchin, it does not seem improbable
that it might have a certain amount of influence in higher animals, and that, for
instance, the offspring of mammals, conceived just before the reproductive organs
become functionless from age, should be, on an average, of smaller size than thos
conceived during their full maturity, This does not seem to be the case, however, ¢
Mr. Gauron has informed me, in a private communication, that a provisional inqui
made by him did not seem to show any difference between the children of old couples
and those of ordinary couples, or any difference between the produce of old and young
thoroughbred stallions.
