It is well known that many of the differential equations integrated by the above
processes, and whose integrals are in some cases capable of an expression merely
symbolical by reason of the number of operations to be performed being fractional,
may be integrated generally, when there is no second term, by means of definite
integrals. ;

Now with reference to most of the equations of this description here integrated,
I have observed that the symbolical form above given is capable of being instantly
(and, as it were, mechanically) converted into a definite integral of the form

=/ oz.*ds,
«

the function pz being typified in the symbolical solution by the form of the opera-
tions preceding the factor a”!. To explain this, let us take the equation

2m
D*u+—Du—Pu=0;

its $ymbolical solution is
u=k(D*—&)"—{a—(D*—c2)="0} ;


LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS, 45

and the assertion is that a solution of the equation in the form of a definite integral
is obtained by writing for pz, k(z2?—c2)"=" and selecting the limits properly ; in fact,
it is known that

u=kſ" (2—&)"='v"d>
is a partial solution ; and as it is a known theorem, that if a= solve
Du+ 2 Du—u=0,
it is also solyed by u=a" if for be written —n, we have for the complete solution

« ids : f . a% p
If for » be written ((1—2m)z) ==! we obtain the soJution of E—@Ou=0, m and

Du+2QDu+(@+Q—&—==))u=0,

of which the solution expressed symbolically is
una" 4(D?— 2) {x (D?—&@)-'0},

the definite integral ought to be

1 1
u=kinsaſ* (21) nde+Ramntensſ" (2—1)-"i="ds,

and this is in fact the solution. The limits must be determined by verifying the equation and assigning them
accordingly; the verification at the same time establishing in the particular cases
the correctness of the results arrived at by the substitution. Thus, if we take the
general form

*2(D)u+4(D)u=0,
and its symbolical solution
u={0(D)}" {#2 2-1-x00},

the conversion here indicated gives
