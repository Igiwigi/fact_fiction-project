Swe conclude that the case is similar to that of the Selago type of Lycopodium. Tsoetes may be regarded as a simple strobilus of which certain sterile leaves

gbilus is the counterpart of a sporogonial head : in function and position the
dence is usually plain enough : the structure, external form, and details of

dence is apparently less close in proportion as the appendicular organs are of
