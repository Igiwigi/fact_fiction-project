These projects are conceived as a way of allowing local
people to be rewarded for the supply of these global services,
but the degree to which they provide equitable benefits is
contested and variable [100].

(b) Other biodiversity related services

The high levels of biodiversity and endemism in the region
[101,102] are not ES per se [103], but they underpin many of
the services already discussed in this paper, as well as
others of note. Some services are valuable even though they
are yet to be realized, for example, diversity can increase
the resilience of socio-ecological systems and offers a pool
of mostly untapped genetic resources. Many ecosystems
and species in the woodlands have high existence values, in
that people derive well-being from the simple fact of knowing
that they exist. These existence values are particularly high
for charismatic mammals, and the central Zambezian
miombo ecoregion has among the highest richness of terres-
trial mammal species of all global ecoregions [104]. This
includes species of very high conservation concern such as
black rhinoceros as well as near-endemic large mammals
like roan antelope and sable antelope.
