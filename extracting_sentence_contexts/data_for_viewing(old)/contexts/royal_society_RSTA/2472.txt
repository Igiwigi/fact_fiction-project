on Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), the world’s largest stellarator [30]. W7-X came into operation at the
end of 2015, and the first experimental campaigns exceeded the expectations. In 2019 and 2020 it
will be equipped with an actively cooled divertor such that long-pulse operation is possible.

Tl. Conclusion

The European Fusion Programme is coherent and addresses in an integrated way all elements that
are needed to develop a fusion reactor. The Fusion Roadmap presents a realistic resource-loaded
path towards the fusion power plant. Its time scale is strongly connected to the availability of
resources. To continue the progress, the DEMO design needs to migrate from the present pre-
conceptual design to a conceptual design by 2020. This will happen after a thorough Gate Review
around 2020 in which a number of less promising design options will be deselected. On the critical
path for DEMO—and in fact for any fusion reactor—is the construction of a 14MeV neutron
source. Ideally, the start of the DONES construction should take place early in the 2020s. DEMO
operation is expected to start in the 2050s.
