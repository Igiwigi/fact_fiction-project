7.—Carbon Monoxide-Hydrogen. p — # Isotherm at —185° C,

point of contact is situated (very approximately) at 55 atmospheres, the mixture
containing 10 per cent. CO.

A large number of measurements were made at —200° C., but owing to the fact that
the great expansion in the loop at that temperature was not realised, search was made

for the border curve in an impossible region. Two points on the p — x loop were
however, determined, and these are of interest in connection with the results obtained
by the entirely different analytical method, to be discussed next.
