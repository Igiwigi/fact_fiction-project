behaviour, it is possible to explore this question with members of the public now.

(b) The moral hazard argument and public perceptions

There is only very limited empirical evidence with which to begin to evaluate the perceived

risk of a geoengineering moral hazard among the general public. One quantitative study, using : 2
a representative sample of US, UK and Canadian opinion and focusing specifically on SRM : S
technologies, found that people were more likely to disagree than agree with the statement ‘Solar a
radiation management should be used so we can continue to use oil, coal and natural gas’ [25]. [4
In initial focus groups with a small sample of the UK public conducted for the 2009 Royal Society : x
report [1], no support was found for the idea that geoengineering would generate a moral hazard. : =
In fact, the data pointed to a possible ‘galvanizing’ effect of geoengineering: although participants : s

were generally cautious or hostile towards geoengineering proposals, several stated that they
would actually be more motivated to undertake mitigation actions themselves (such as reducing
energy consumption) if they saw government and industry investing in geoengineering research
or deployment. This unexpected response seemed to be most pronounced among participants
with more sceptical views on climate change.

The question of whether geoengineering might ‘galvanize’ sceptical public opinion is an
intriguing one. It is well known that key determinants of climate change scepticism are the
values and cultural ‘worldviews’ that people hold [26-28], and that individuals who endorse
free-market economic principles and reject the regulation of industry by governments are more
likely to be sceptical about climate change. Typically, it is assumed that scepticism about the
