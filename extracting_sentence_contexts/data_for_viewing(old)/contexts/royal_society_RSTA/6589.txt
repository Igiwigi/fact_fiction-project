Bistribution of pressure at sea-level by Buys Batxor’s Law would be southerly. The
revailing winds are south-easterly, or in Cachar north-easterly, the average angle
qetween the wind and the isobars being about 60°, an effect which is possibly due in
rt to convective interchange ; though, as we have already seen, the activity of such
@nterchange at this season is not great. The northerly winds at Multan, Jeypore, and
gra, to which attention was directed in the first part of this Paper, are evidently the
Affects of the high pressure in the upper strata over Afghanistan and the Aravali
region respectively, these stations being all in the drier part of North-western India,
where clear skies and a high temperature range, with their accompaniment of active
convection currents, are not infrequent even in July.

The extensive belt of low pressure, at high altitudes, stretching across the Central
Provinces and the head of the Bay, is doubtless connected with the fact, brought
prominently to notice in Mr. Exror’s paper last referred to, that cyclonic storms
formed during the prevalence of the S,W. monsoon usually pass inland across the
Orissa coast, meeting with little obstruction from the ranges of low hills they have to
