untrustworthy Agents (who were generally disadvantageous
to interact with), participants who acted on positive lies had
significantly lower payoffs than those acting on the truth
(b = -0.80, r (1) = 17.44, p < 0.001), while those who acted on
negative lies were not significantly disadvantaged (b = —0.32,
C (1) = 0.90, p = 0.344). In the case of previously trustworthy
Agents (who were generally advantageous to interact with),
participants who acted on positive lies had significantly
lower payoffs than those acting on truth (b =—0.90, C (=
9.12, p= 0.003), while those who acted on negative lies were
again not significantly disadvantaged (b = —0.28, C (1) =2.51,
p=0.113). This pattern for previously trustworthy Agents dif-
fers somewhat from study 1 and is due to the fact that the
populations of Agents underlying each type of message were
not identical (see tables 2.4 and 2.5 in the electronic supplemen-
tary material). We have no good reason for why this occurred,
apart from random chance.

(iii) Detecting dishonest gossip

Our findings are again consistent with the possibility that dis-
honest gossip may erode the ability for gossip to bolster
cooperation. We now test H2 and the claim that people will
evaluate dishonest gossip as less accurate than honest gossip.
To do this, we first regressed participants’ ratings of message
