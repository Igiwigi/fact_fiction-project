In both cases, the system is analysed in terms of an equivalent linear damper,
whose value changes with excitation level. Although the focus of this paper is on systems with
positive values of both linear and nonlinear damping, which are thus stable, it is noted that
the amplitude response of an unstable system, with negative linear damping, can be limited by
positive nonlinear damping, as described by Rayleigh [1]. In fact, amplitude stabilization of such : =

instabilities occurs in the human cochlea, where the resulting limit cycle oscillations are known Sy
as spontaneous otoacoustic emissions [15]. 2

For sinusoidal excitation, it is seen that such an equivalent linear damper can be obtained aed
by retaining the fundamental term in a harmonic balance analysis, which is equivalent to _
the describing function approach used in control engineering. Closed-form solutions for the : Ss
equivalent linear damper can be obtained, in terms of the driving level, for a single-degree-of- DNS
freedom system will low-order nonlinear damping, but iterative methods need to be used for : =
higher order nonlinearities or in MDOF systems. For random excitation, it is shown that an error : s

minimization technique, a series truncation approach and an equivalent power method all give
the same expression for the equivalent linear damper, which is equal to the cross-correlation
between the damping force and the velocity, divided by the auto-correlation of the velocity, both
at zero lag.
