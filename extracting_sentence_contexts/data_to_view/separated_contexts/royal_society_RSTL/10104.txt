It agrees with these latter in all its sabsequent changes
and in its adult structure, and must be regarded as forming one of the thoracic series. T have employed the recognised name, third maxilliped, to prevent confusion, but the
appendage is in no sense a mouth part. In fact, the only reason for holding that the
missing appendage in Lucifer is the fifth pereiopod, instead of the last, maxilliped, is
the tacit as8umption that the appendages must follow a definite serial order from in
front backwards. We do not know that this assumption is justifiable in all cases, and
it is therefore perfectly possible that the appendage which is usually called the third
maxilliped of Lucifer may really be the first pereioped. I think the probability is in
favour of the accepted homology, but the use of the term © third maxilliped ” in the
present paper for the appendage in question must not be regarded as evidence that
the homology is accepted without question.
