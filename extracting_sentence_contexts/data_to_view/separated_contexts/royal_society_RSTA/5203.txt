V.—THE Mope or Burnine or GAstous CarRpon.

§ 1. The fact that carbonic oxide is not acted on directly by oxygen, even in the
explosion-wave, points to the possibility that the carbon in gaseous hydrocarbons, and
in other volatile carbon compounds, is not oxidised directly to carbonic acid when
these gases are burnt with an excess of oxygen. When cyanogen, for instance, is
exploded with oxygen, the carbon may burn in one or in two stages. Each atom may
either combine directly with two atoms of oxygen to form carbonic acid, or each atom

smay combine first with a single atom of oxygen to form carbonic oxide, which after-
Svards combines with a second atom of oxygen to form carbonic acid.
