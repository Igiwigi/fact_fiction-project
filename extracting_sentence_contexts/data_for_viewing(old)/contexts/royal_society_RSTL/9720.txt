etween the striated portion and the tinfoil (as well as that between the tinfoil and
e negative terminal) became highly sensitive, showing positive intermittence.
Sb If the wire from the tinfoil be connected to the positive terminal of the machine in
e interfering system, we shall of course have negative discharges within the tube,
Zind all the intermittence will be of a negative type. With this arrangement we are
Able to produce the well known phenomenon of repulsion of the positive luminosiby ;
and, with proper adjusbments, to get excellent examples of what we have called the
ng-terminal form of negative effect, and of all the forms with which we are familiar
Sn positive-relief or negabive-special effects.* Again, as in the case of the positive air-
A ark, if the air-spark in the interfering system be long, s0 that the intervals between
the impulses are very considerable, or if in any other way we deviate far from the

ly to the original discharge and partly to the interfering system. This fact makes
s incline more strongly to accept the explanation given above of the ease and com-
Spleteness with which the typical positive effect can be obtained, and the strong
mblance which the results of positive interference bear to those of the positive-
_—_ through a great range of air-spark. The negative is very inferior to the
ABpositive in this respect, and naturally must be 80, since the structure seb up by the
p negative impulses, though suited to the needs of their own circumstances, is wholly
= unlike the structure that the discharge would sbape for itself in order to facilitate its
(4 pas8age through the tube ; and hence there is a greater tendency for it to reassert its
F former shape and appear superimposed upon the visible results of the interference.t
