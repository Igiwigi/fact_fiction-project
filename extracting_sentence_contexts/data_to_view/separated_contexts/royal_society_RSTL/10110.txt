In each case the homology is a resemblance which
& is independent of external conditions, but which may be obscured by secoudary modifi-
Zeations whenever external conditions render it necessary. 5 In each case, too, the secondary modifications become less marked, and the underlying
& plan more evident as we pass back from the adult to earlier and earlier stages of deve-
Z lopment. We must therefore include all three kinds of homology in a single class or
S category, and the employment of one term to denote the phenomena of special homo-
E logy, of another for serial homologies, and a third for bilateral homologies, and others for
& ®ther sorts of general homology must, not be allowed to obscure the fact that they are
all different forms of the same thing, essential similarity joined to superficial diversity. The terminology which has been employed by BroxN, Hacker, LANKESTER, and
others for the different kinds of homology is valuable, and the only reason why I
have not made use of it is that the more familiar terms, *serial homology” and ©bi-lateral
symmetry” answer every purpose equally well in treating of the Arthropods. HACKEL's
subdivisions are natural, but they are simply subdivisions of a great clags of similar
phenomena, which must still be included under the general term © homology.”
