stage of the second, were compared there was not a significant difference.

The concentration of immature pyronin cells. Within the second-set grafts there was no
significant difference between the average numbers of immature pyronin cells at 8 and at
12 days; this was also the case for the first-set grafts. There was no significant difference
between first- and second-set grafts in their increments of immature pyronin cells between
8 and 12 days.

Correlations within second-set grafts. A point of interest is that there were no correlations
within the 8-day grafts of the second-set series, nor within the 12-day members. This is
in contrast to the first-set grafts where at 8 days there were several positive correlations,
notably one between lymphocytes and immature pyronin cells. The difference between
the two sets may depend on the fact that the second-set grafts at 8 days were in a much
more advanced state of destruction than the first set, and that at an earlier stage (say
6 days) the second set might correspond with the first.

With regard to the positive correlation between the lymphocyte counts in the 8- and
12-day second-set grafts, in the first-set grafts there was no such correlation between 8 and
12 days. It is interesting, however, that the seven most rapid of the first-sets did appear,
by inspection, to show a positive correlation between their 8- and 12-day lymphocyte
counts. The rest tended towards a negative correlation. The second-set grafts would
therefore appear to correspond with the more rapid of the first sets.

The reason why no correlations were found between the 8- and 12-day numbers of the
first-set grafts such as were found in the second sets lies at least partly in the comparative
