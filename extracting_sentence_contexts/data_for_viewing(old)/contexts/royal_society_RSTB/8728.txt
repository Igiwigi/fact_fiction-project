research on the topic holds inconsistencies, the resolution of which may be
crucial to such a theory.

Many existing models have explicitly attempted a ‘creationist’ strategy,
trying to explain how consciousness arises from or is created by brain processes.
As often pointed out (e.g. [1]), it is very difficult, if not impossible, to show that
a particular relationship between neural and mental states indicates that the one
level of description explains the other, let alone causes it. To do so, one needs a
further claim saying more than just two observations go together.

The reason for our pessimism for the ‘creationist’ strategy is that we believe
that such a ‘further claim’ can never be built on the same scientific grounds as
the correlation. This is a consequence of the fact that the use of one level of
description, referring to conscious experience, is a necessary methodological
