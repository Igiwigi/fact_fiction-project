5. Should we keep calling Uranus and Neptune the ‘ice giants’? Often Uranus and Neptune are referred to as the ‘ice giants.’ The origin of the name is probably
linked to the mean densities of the planets which are comparable to the density of water, and due
to the fact that they are located at large radial distances where volatile materials can condense to
form ices (water, ammonia, methane). However, we actually do not know if the compositions of Uranus and Neptune are dominated
by these materials, and even Pluto seems to consist of more rock than ice [84]. Indeed it was shown
that the observed properties of the planets can be fit also with a rock-dominated composition
[63], and recently, it has been suggested that Neptune could be a ‘rock-giant’ based on measured
atmospheric abundances (see Teanby et al. [85] and references therein for further details).
