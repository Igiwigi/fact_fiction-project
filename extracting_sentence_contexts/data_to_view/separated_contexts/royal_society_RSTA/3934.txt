All of them fix the total volume V, whereas
H-AdResS and AdResS also fix the total mass as WV. H-AdResS can be made either insulated
(no heat exchange with exterior), isolated (constant total energy) or isothermal (by a global
thermostat). AdResS just ensures momentum balance, and does not explicitly treat the heat

1m fact, it is also possible to use A = AN as the extensive quantity and @ = @/N as the intensive one. The work would then be
@AA. The determination of the best choice will have to wait for a practical implementation on this idea.
