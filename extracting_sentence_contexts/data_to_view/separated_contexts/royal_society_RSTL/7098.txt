It appears, therefore, that 80 far as any information extends which is afforded to us by
the specific heat of silver, the symbol of this metal may be regarded as identical in form
with that of zinc or mercury, the equation under consideration being expressed thus,

exe=ux"+ 20,
or as being similar to the equation which expresses the relation existing between mer-
curous chloride and its elements,

x32 =ax2+23. Or again, it may also be regarded as identical in form with the symbols of chlorine and
of nitrogen; in which case the above equation is thus expressed,

2ux6, =%x*+ gr,
and is similar to the equation which connects the symbols of the chloride of iodine with
those of chlorine and iodine, -

2axw=ux? + wa?. And, lastly, the facts are not even inconsistent with the assumption that the 8ymbol of
sver is identical in form with the symbols of oxygen and suIphur, 8 that

ax'gr=ax+i,
which is similar to the equation which connects the symbol of the bisulphide of chlorine
with the symbols of its elements

ax =ux2 + 0. The symbols of silyer and its compounds appear, on the two more probable hypotheses,
as follows:

Hypothesis I. W=A, X=23;.
