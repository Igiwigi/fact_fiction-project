Generally, the higher the impact velocity : =
U and steeper the angle a, the deeper the projectile penetrates into the water column (an impact £8

velocity of U=18kms~! and a = 45° are the most likely parameters). The intermediate regime
between shallow-water and deep-water impacts may range from L/ = 1 to L/h = 0.17, where L is
the projectile diameter and h is the water depth [9]. In fact, the vast majority of impacts occur at an oblique impact angle. However, the most often
studied case (experimentally and through numerical models) is the very unlikely vertical strike
of a bolide (figure 1). In a vertical impact, the perfect cylindrical symmetry, where the collapse
of the transient cavity occurs in all radial directions at the same time, causes an implausibly
high central jet of water (figure 1IIla and IVb), that later collapses to drive an outward going
wave.
