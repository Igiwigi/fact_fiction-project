18. CRoss-SECTION A LOOP OF THE LEMNISCATE OF BERNOULLI

The object of this section is to give the correct solution for the cross-section which
is a loop of the lemniscate of Bernoulli, to replace the incorrect solution given by
Young, Elderton and Pearson (1918, p. 61). It illustrates the method of § 14,
and is in fact the problem which led to the discovery of that method. Consider the system of orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates ¢, 7 defined by

(z+c) (z—c) = ce, (18-1)
where € = +i, z=x-+y. Writing
z—ce=7,6%, ztc=re%,
(18-1) is equivalent to 1% — cre, 0,+0,= 27,
or, in cartesian co-ordinates
(x? a y—c?)?
