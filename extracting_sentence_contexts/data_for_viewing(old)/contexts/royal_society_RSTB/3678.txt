play any important part in the cycle.

A further discrepancy consists in the view held by the German workers at the
time of writing their paper, in regard to the salivary gland phases being a non-
essential part of the eycle. My interpretation of the endogenous cycle in the blood of
the vertebrate is at present, as far as I am aware, unconfirmed by other workers,

largely, I imagine, owing to the fact that the interest has been concentrated for
some time past on the appearances in the fly rather than on those in the vertebrate.

Summary.

1. 7. gambiense undergoes an endogenous cycle of development in the vertebrate in
the circulating blood. This cycle is of irregular duration and is repeated many times
in the course of the disease.

2. The short forms may be regarded as the adult blood-types ; the intermediate
types are growth-forms, proceeding to the long individuals, which are those about to
divide. The products of division give rise, directly or indirectly, to the adult forms.
The adult forms appear to be alone responsible for carrying on the cycle in the
