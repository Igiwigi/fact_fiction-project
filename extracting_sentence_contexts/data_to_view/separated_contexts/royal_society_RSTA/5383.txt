force to which it gives rise is also apparently simple, being merely the sum of two
forces, one the electromagnetic, VJB, the other a force on magnetised matter whose i
component is (I + M)V,R, both per unit volume, the latter being accompanied (in
cease of eolotropy) by a torque. Now I is the intrinsic and M the induced magueti-
sation, so the force is made irrespective of the proportion in which the magnetisation
exists as intrinsic or induced. In fact, MaxweEtw’s “ magnetisation” is the sum of
the two without reservation or distinction. But to unite them is against the whole
behaviour of induced and intrinsic magnetisation in the electromagnetic scheme of
_MaxweLt, as I interpret it. Intrinsic magnetisation (using Sir W. THomson’s term)
Should be regarded as impressed (I = phy, where hy is the equivalent impressed
nagnetic force); on the other hand, “induced” magnetisation depends on the force
f the field {M =(y»—1)R}.
