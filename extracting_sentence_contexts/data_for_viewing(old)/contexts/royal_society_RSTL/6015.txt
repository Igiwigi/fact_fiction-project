39. Hence putting for the moment
M=(p*—2")(2—42)(a"—zf),
it appears that the last of the three equations is Mz=0 ; the first and s8econd are of
course Mx=0 and My=0, and the required condition is M=0, that is,
(P—2#)(#—2#)(z—z*)=0,
the equation which, combined with the equation of the curye
2+ ++ blayz=0,
gives the sextactic points. There are consequently twenty-seven such points, and it is
at once seen that these are the points of contact of the tangents to the cubic from the
points of inflexion, or, what is the same thing, that the twenty-seven sextactic points form
nine groups of three each, such that the three points of a group have for their common
tangential one of the nine points of inflexion. In fact, let » be a cube root (real or
imaginary) of unity, the three sextactic points of one of the groups will be given by
ſ W—w} =0,
li +4*+2+612yz=0.

Now consider the tangential of any one of these points, its coordinates are

. S=a(yf—2),
H=y(G—2),
2 =2(a%—z);
or, reducing by the equation z—oy=0, a;=ay(a*—2), y=—y(@a*—2?), 2=0, or, what

is the same thing, z,+oy,=0, 2z,=0; that is, the point (#,, y;, 21) is one of the points of
