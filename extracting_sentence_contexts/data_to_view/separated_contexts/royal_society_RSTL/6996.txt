'These views, it need scarcely be said, differ entirely from those generally entertained
upon the development and formation of muscular tissue. They are supported by
detailed observations made in all classes of animals, and in the same species at different
periods of age. There are 8ome facts in connexion with the changes occurring in disease
which afford support to this view, which involves three positions. That in the nutrition
of muscle the pabulum invariably becomes converted into germinal matter; that the
latter undergoes change, and gradually becomes contractile tissue ; and that all the con-
tractile material of muscle was once in the state of the material of which the nuclei or
masses of germinal matter are composed. It is not deposited from the blood, nor pro-
duced by the action of the nuclei at a distance, but it results from a change in the very
matter of the nucleus itself.
