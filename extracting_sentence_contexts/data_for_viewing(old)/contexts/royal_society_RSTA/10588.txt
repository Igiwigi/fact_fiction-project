228 PROFESSOR C. J. JOLY ON QUATERNIONS AND PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY.

The symbol of the plane containing three points a, b,c, may be written in the
form

P =lapreloutuati als attend Setallo)s

and on transformation this becomes
np, = [fa,fb, fe] = 2’ [abe] = Fp = F'flp, . . . ... (11),

where 7 is a certain scalar and where F” is an auxiliary function.

In fact, the first equation sums up the last article; in the second a new function
F’ is introduced, and in the fourth equation (9) is utilized.
Since p, is quite arbitrary (11) may be replaced by the symbolical equations
