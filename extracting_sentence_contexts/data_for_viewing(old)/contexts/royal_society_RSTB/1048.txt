5 fresh and spirit specimens, as seen without cutting sections. In fact the method
& of sections has been little applied to the development of Cirripedes, and not at all to
‘8 the earlier stages. There is, therefore, little apology needed for an account embracing
Z the results obtained by the employment of some of the more modern methods of
> embryological study.
= My account of the development of Balanus perforatus differed in so many respects
= from that of previous observers on the same and other Cirripedia, that I was induced
= to compare the development in a number of forms, believing that the wide differences
& stated to exist must be due, at any rate in part, to actual differences in the develop-
@ ment of the different forms, such as occurs in other groups in which the ontogeny of
& allied species and genera have been compared. This expectation was, however, only
3 partially realised ; I found, on the contrary, a great uniformity in the development of
© the different forms, an agreement, in fact, so close that all might be conveniently
treated together. The species studied were Balanus perforatus, Chthamalus stellatus,
Port; Lepas anatifera, Lyn. ; L. pectinata, Spencuer; and Conchoderma virgata,
Srencier. I was enabled by a comparison of these forms to confirm previous work
on certain points, and to establish other facts which have, in many cases, the merit
of reconciling apparently discordant opinions. ‘The present account treats of the
development of these forms as far as and including the second Nauplius stage.

The early development of the Rhizocephalan genus Peltogaster was also investi-
gated, but as this form showed certain differences from the others, I judged it best to
reserve my account of it for a future occasion.
