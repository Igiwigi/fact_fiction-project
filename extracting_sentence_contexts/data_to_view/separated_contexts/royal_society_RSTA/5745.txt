This argument suggests that
sync may in fact lead to a new approach to the horizon problem. Another possible implication of sync is related to the behaviour of entropy on approach to
the past singularity. This is connected to the fact that each time two spatial point trajectories in
inhomogeneous space-time synchronize with each other, the entropy of the system reduces as a
result of syne: information about the states of the spatial points before sync is lost after sync as they
now evolve in unison to one another, so the asymptotic rate of creation of information towards the
past singularity is thus reduced, cf. [60]. Therefore, any region evolving near the past singularity
and containing synchronized spatial points possibly has lower entropy than what it would have
had without sync. This mechanism for entropy reduction does not involve any ‘thermal’ effects
like those found in inflationary models.
