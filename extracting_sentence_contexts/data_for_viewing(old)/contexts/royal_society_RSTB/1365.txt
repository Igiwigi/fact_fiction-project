Tt will be seen that the symptoms described above are for the most part quite like
of the hemisphere cats. The rotation fits and the twisted position of the head
“were, however, much more strongly marked than in the latter animals. It would of
‘course be difficult, with the slight knowledge before us, to attempt an explanation of
‘the phenomenon. It occurs as is well known in lesions of the cerebellum (see later).
In the above cats the superior cerebellar peduncle would have been divided after its
‘decussation, and, therefore, ascending impulses from the cut surface would pass to
left hemisphere, the hemisphere the connections of which with the cord are cut
‘@f by the incision. Or the impulses might have descended from the eut surface by
fhe direct fibres on the left side, coming from the quadrigeminal region; if this
‘ere so, one would have expected to see this phenomenon in the hemisphere cats.
pulses might have passed from the left hemisphere across the corpus callosum to
e opposite hemisphere ; in favour of this might be advanced the fact that extensive
neration changes had immediately followed, especially in the first cat, in the left
misphere after the incision, and that the irritation set up by the changes might
ve been transmitted across the corpus callosum.
