There are several differences between various writers with regard to the eastern
part of the Oriental region, but these do not require notice here. The above is not a
complete list of contributions to the question, but it comprises, I believe, all the
writers who have discussed at any length the question of the divisions to be
established in the western part of the Oriental region.

4. Preciminary REMARKS.

Before proceeding further, a few remarks are necessary. It is usual to write about
boundaries and limits of regions and subregions as if these were really well-marked
lines that can be laid down on a map. As a matter of fact, as has been pointed out
by other writers, such boundaries are only definite when they coincide with some
peculiar physical feature, such as a range of hills, which, lying at right angles to the
direction of the rain-bearing winds, causes an abrupt difference in the rainfall and
consequently in the vegetation. This is the case along the Sahyddri or Western
Ghats, which run parallel with the Malabar coast, and even in this case the difference
becomes less marked in the south of India, because rain-bearing winds come from
opposite sides of the range at different seasons. Generally, there is no definite limit to
a region or subregion ; there is a gradual change in the fauna throughout a tract often
several hundreds of miles in width. Thus it is very difficult to assign any distinct
limits to the Indo-Malay region on the west side of India. A few Indian animals
range throughout Baluchistan and even into Arabia and Palestine, though they are
greatly exceeded in number by the prevailing desert (Eremian) forms of the North
