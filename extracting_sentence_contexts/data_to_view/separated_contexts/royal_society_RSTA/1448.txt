The theory further indicated that atoms which have lost two
electrons, or have become doubly ionised, would be found to be characterised by series
involving the constant 9R, and so on. The theoretical prediction has now been
verified in the case of silicon so far as trebly-ionised atoms, which have 16R for the
series constant. The degree of ionisation is, in fact, most surely indicated by the
value of the corresponding constant for the series. Alternating Types of Series. The theory further indicates that the spectra obtained at successive stages of ionisation
should vary in type.
