= Behind these expansions there is no cartilage, the whole occipital ring being still
= membranous, and the two muscular segments (14s.) being visible from above when the
A hind brain is removed.

= The hind brain is now walled in at the sides by the great trabecular crest (figs. 1, 5,
= & 6, tr.), the height of which is equal to the breadth of the broadest part of the bar
= whence it arises. The temporal muscle (fig. 6) arises from this crest, and is inserted into
S the coronoid region of Mzcker's cartilage.

> There is no distinction between alisphenoid and orbito-sphenoid either in Amphibians
= or Selachians ; and there must be some meaning shut up in the fact that the greatest
> similitude to vertebral segments is seen in the most specialized types of skull. The
X trabeculz are oval on section in front (fig. 4, tr.), and end opposite the eyeballs on the
z side, and the junction of the mid and fore brain within. At present, then, the
= ethmoidal and nasal regions and the lateral © horns” are absent. Only the common,
= paired rudiments of the posterior and anterior sphenoids are present. There is no
51 anterior clinoid cartilage,” and the © posterior clinoid wall ” does not rise behind the
S 8mall pituitary body (py.).

E Attached to the under face of the fore half of the free trabecular rod is an oval, bony
= plate with bristling teeth. This is the palatine bone ; and in front of it is a similar '

toothed plate, the yomer (p.pg., v.).
