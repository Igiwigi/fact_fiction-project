According to the inferences of Dr. Faravar therefore, the ex-
periments, which prove that the nervous influence is the agent in the functions we
have been considering, all of which we have seen are chemical processes, are sufficient
to prove its electric nature; and we are now also, on the other hand, furnished with
direct proof that the brain is capable of collecting and applying, even according to
the dictates of the will, the electric power. Dr. Davy in his last paper on the torpedo-f observes that, © when the brain has been

divided longitudinally, the fish has continued to give shocks; when the brain has
been entirely extracted, the fish instantly lost this power, though the muscles gene-
rally continued to act powerfully ;” from which it appears that the electric power is
not like the muscular independent of the brain, but on the contrary immediately de-
pending on it ; proving that in this, as in all the other neryous functions, as appears
from the facts stated in a paper which the Royal Society did me the honour to
publish in 1829, and which was republished in my Inguiry into the Nature of Sleep
and Death, the nerves are merely the passive, the brain, one of the active parts of the
nervous sy8tem. In the foregoing positions we here find, as in other similar instances, that when truth
is once arrived at, other facts, beside those which led to it, arise to give it their aid. Dr. Davy made no experiments to determine hoy far the spinal marrow, the only
other part of the neryous system concerned in the formation of thenervous influence,
partakes of the function in question.
