Balmer series of Hydrogen, and the mean values of the separations of the doublets
constituting the lines H, and H, have been found to be respectively 0°132 A.U., and
0°033 A.U. These values are consistent with the separations appropriate to Principal
series, and the first is in precise agreement with the value deduced by Buisson and
Fapry.

Note on the Band Spectrum of Heliwm.—We have made a number of observations
of the pinkish glow which surrounds the cathode in a Helium tube excited by the
ordinary discharge. The cathode glow in Helium presents a very striking appearance
when viewed through coloured screens which transmit only a narrow region of the
spectrum. Through a violet screen the dark space around the electrode is clearly
defined and surrounded by a uniform glow. Viewed through a screen which transmits
red rays only, the appearance is entirely changed, the “ dark space” being in fact the
region in which the red rays are predominant. The band spectrum of Helium is
relatively strong in the cathode glow, though not intrinsically so strong as with the
“bulb discharge.”* In this connection we may mention that we have definite
evidence from the relative intensities of the bands in the “ bulb discharge” and the
cathode glow that this spectrum is capable of sub-division. Apart from theoretical
considerations, this circumstance may be of importance in modifying the conclusion
that the spectrum in question is absent from celestial spectra.
