One considers the problem

min{A(Q2) + |2|:2CR?, simply connected}. (4.2)


It has been conjectured since 1951 that the solution of this problem is the ball (see [22] for an
overview of open problems of spectral isoperimetric type). Following an idea of Willms and
Weinberger [23], a way to prove this fact is to prove the existence of a smooth set 2* solving (4.2).
We refer to [24] for a proof of the existence, but still the smoothness question remains unsolved.

Problem 4.4. Prove the existence of a smooth solution for (4.2).
