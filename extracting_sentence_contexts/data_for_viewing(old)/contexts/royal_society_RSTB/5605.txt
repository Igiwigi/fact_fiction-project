There are two noteworthy features in the afferent connections of the cerebellum in
Ornithorhynchus—possibly not actually peculiar to this animal but only developed in
it to an unprecedented degree—namely, the connections from the lateral nucleus of the
sensory fifth and that from the mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth. In so far as it is
permissible to draw a functional analogy from other animals, the mesencephalic
fifth should be a nucleus of muscle sense and as such should be intimately related to the
cerebellum. There is no previous report in the literature of mammalian brains which
the writer could discover of an actual connection similar to this, although since the
first report of this finding (March, 1925) Tsar (1925) has demonstrated a feeble
tecto-cerebellar tract in the opossum. WINKLER, as reported elsewhere, believes a part
(the lateral) of the sensory fifth serves this same purpose. His criterion is based upon
the terminals of cells in that region being the same as those of the medial lemniscus.
Such a finding, if it be a fact, would allow this connection a proprioceptive function.
The chief tecto-cerebellar systems originate from the midbrain layers predominantly
optic and probably would aid in the maintenance of tonic influence upon muscle groups
in response to stimulation of the second nerve (see Scummazono (1912) in the bird).

The writer could identify none of the direct efferent systems outlined for birds by
FRENKEL (1909) as the cerebello-spinal or bulbar tract, nor could a floccular commissure
be demonstrated.

The pons, although it is small and insignificant in both Platypus and Echidna, is not
as large as their respective cortexes might seem to warrant. Their size may be
correlated with the negligible lateral hemispheres of middle lobe.
