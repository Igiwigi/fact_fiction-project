Pniay's experiments to ascertain the principle

GaLtots, occasion a loss of power-in the heart. He remarks

that till the above explanation / occurred. to him, he had

resolved to'abandon this part-of the.inquiyy. |. * Apres bien

des efforts inutiles pour porter la lumiere, dans cette tenE-
« hreuse question,je pris le parti de .'abandonner, non sans
« regret d'y avoir sacrifie un” grand nombre d'animaux, et
«© perdu beaucoup de temps.” Just before, he observes, © En
« un mot, j'eus presque autant de r6sultats difterens que d'ex-
« periences.” This may be easily 'accounted for, as he was
not aware that the rapidity with which any portion of the
spinal marrow is destroyed, influences the result. We also
see why the sudden destruction of one half of the spinal mar-
row, after it had been divided; not only brought death'to that
part-of the animal to which-it belonged, but to the other also;
a'fact which -seems in direct opposition, to-M, LE GALLors'
explanation of that we have just been considering. In M. Le GaLro1s' experiments, the --spinal marrow was
always crushed by a stilet, of precisely: the'same dimensions
with the cavity of the spine:\ In the foregoing experiments,
the spinal marrow was either removed- or destroyed by a
comparatively small wire moved about in-it till all its func-
tions ceased.
