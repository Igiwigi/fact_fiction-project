This cireum-
stance, before it was understood, had thrown the greatest difficulties in the way of
the inquiry, and protracted it to a most tedious length by preventing the attainment
of accordant results. It is to prevent the like inconvenience to those who repeat these
experiments that this section of the paper is specially devoted. Attention has pre-
viously been drawn to the fact, that the nitroprussides form chemical compounds
with the cyanides of iron. This seems to be a case of the same kind, but of more
ultimate union. The impurity or chemically attached cyanide in this case appears
to be Fe Cy,, or perhaps Fe Cy+H Cy, judging from analysis only, for its separation
has not been accomplished.
