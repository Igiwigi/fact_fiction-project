facts which T have adduced justify us in reconsidering the whole theory of rhythm as
due to ganglia.

(k.) As I have already said, I am not inclined to deny that there is probably some
truth in the current theory of rhythm as due to ganglia ; I merely wish to point ont,
distinctly that this theory is inadequate, and that in order to cover all the facts, it
will require to be snpplemented by the theory which I now propose. The current
theory of rhythm as due to ganglia attributes the whole of the effect to the gan-
glionic element, and thus fails to meet the facts of a rhythm which is artificially
produced after the ganglionic element has been removed. It also fails to meet a
number of other facts of the firs} importance. For it is beyond all doubt that
rhythmic action of the strictes> kind occurs in an innumerable multitude of -cases
where it is quite impossible to suppose anything resembling ganglia to be present.
Not to mention such cases as the Snail's heart, where the most careful scrutiny has
failed to detect the least vestige of ganglia, but to descend at once to the lowest
forms of animal and vegetable life, rhythmic action may here be said to be the rule
rather than the exception. The beautifully regular motions observable in some Alge,
Diatomacee, and Ocillatoriee, in countless numbers of Infusoria, antherozoids, and
gpermatozoa, in ciliary action, and even in the petioles of Hedysarum gyrans, are all
instances (to which many others might be added) of rhythmical action where the pre-
sence of ganglia is out of the question. Again, in a general way, is it not jus as we
recede from these primitive forms of contractile tissue that we find rhythmic action to
become less usnal ? And, if this is 80, may it not be that those contractile tissues
