A
comparison in Struthio and Larus of the dorsal and ventral arcualia, in regard to the
degree of their participation in the formation of the secondary vertebral body, shows
that the dorsal arcualia surpass the ventral ones. From the comparison it also follows
that the share of the interdorsals in the building up of a definite cartilaginous vertebral
centrum is greater than the part played in this regard by the basidorsals. j

Arriving at the end of our discussion of the evolution of the vertebral centrum, it is
of great interest once more to emphasise the fact that the cartilaginous centra of Larus
and Séruthio consist of two genetically and structurally different portions. The inner
portion or the “ primary vertebral body ” immediately surrounding the remainder of the
notochord consists of more or less flattened concentrically disposed cells and develops
from the perichordal tube. ‘The outer portion is represented by the bases of the dorsal
and the ventral arcualia which consist of irregularly disposed isodiametric cells and arise

from the secondary sclerotomes.
