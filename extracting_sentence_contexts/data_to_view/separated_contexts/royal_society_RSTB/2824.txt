THE MORPHOLOGY OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 239

fossil Equisetinez ; for, as is well known, the sporangiophores occupy in Pal@ostachya
a position at the base of the internode, in Calamostachys in the middle of the
internode, and in Cingularia (of which the true relations must be considered still
uncertain) at the upper limit of the internode.* Such facts as these, here only briefly
sketched, must be taken into account in discussing the morphology of the strobilus
of the Equisetinez, and in deciding the true character of the sporangiophores. The current view of the strobilus of EZquisetwm is that it is a product of metamor-
phosis of the sterile shoot, and that the sporangiophore is an altered sterile leaf. This has been re-stated lately by Gorpen,t on the basis of development of the
individual, but without bringing the fossil Calamarian strobili into the comparison.
