Hence, in contrast with the standard microeconomic theory, the dynamical nature of a : a
stochastic price means that it is randomly changing and evolving in time. In particular, the 78
prices are not the result of an equilibrium between supply and demand—as is expressed in the Dw
general equilibrium theory—but, instead, market prices are determined by the form of the action :
functional A[x]. : a

The microeconomic kinetic term T[x(t)] is quite unlike the case for physics, for which only the : Ss
‘velocity’ term (ax/at)? appears. In fact, it is shown in [6] that the acceleration term (2x/dt?)* is :
forbidden in quantum mechanics as it leads to a time evolution that does not conserve probability.
As the prime purpose of modelling price is to explain the unequal time correlation functions, there
is no need for a probabilistic interpretation of the action functional, as is the case for quantum
mechanics.

The fundamental assumption of statistical microeconomics is that the behaviour of the price
of a commodity is described by the microeconomic Lagrangian, a model of which is given
in equation (3.3). The probability of the different prices being observed is determined by a
probability density functional that is, up to a proportionality constant Z, given by the action
functional as follows:
