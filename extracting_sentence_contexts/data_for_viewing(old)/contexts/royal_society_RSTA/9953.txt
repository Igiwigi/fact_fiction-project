(b) The electrification of the drops was tested by placing a small cylindrical box
over the air nozzle (as shown by the dotted outline in the figure) to catch the drops
as they fell. A small hole was made in the side of this box about 2 cm. from the
bottom, so that a layer of water 2 cm. deep was always in the bottom, and into this
the drops fell. The Lenard effect would come into play when the drops splashed on
the water in the box, but as all the electricity separated remained within the tray
and its lid, this effect could cause no charging of the system. If, however, the drops
had fallen with a charge on them it would have been detected by a deflection of the
electrometer. No such effect could be observed.

(c) In order to prevent the Lenard effect from coming into play when the drops
fell into the tray after breaking up on the air jet, use was made of the fact discovered
by Lenarp that the splashing of salt water produces the opposite charge to that

given by the splashing of distilled water. A layer of salt water 2 cm. deep was
therefore placed in the bottom of the tray and into this the drops fell after breaking
up on the jet. The following test was then made: The funnel was slightly moved to
the side so that the drops of distilled water fell directly with their full velocity on to
the salt water on the bottom of the tray, and the blast was also set in action in order
to remove the air containing any charge separated from the water on splashing, and
so to produce the largest Lenard effect possible.
