follows along the lines ‘suggested previously by the work of Grprert and Zunvz,t
Lorwy,{ and Dovenas and Hatpant.§ The severity of the work is such that the
muscular activity outruns the oxygen supply, and insufticiently oxidised metabolites
such as lactic acid are put out from the active muscles. The lactic acid aids the CO,
to stimulate the respiratory centre, and the hyperpneea, being from the point of view
of CO, alone excessive, leads to excessive removal of CO, from the body without
proportionate increase in the intake of oxygen. The respiratory quotient is thereby
raised to an abnormal height. On the cessation of the exercise the process of excessive
CO, removal was still incomplete, and the respiratory quotient was at the stop and in
the four minutes immediately after it still above unity. The excessive removal of CO,

* We were compelled on Pike’s Peak, owing to lack of space, to sit in a rather constrained position on
the floor and this may very likely account for the fact that the oxygen consumption per minute is unduly
high and variable.
