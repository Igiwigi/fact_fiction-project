these states. Once this information is given, there is a well-defined thermodynamic prescription
for calculating system properties. Consider a DNA region D that can bind a set of proteins Xi
(i=1,...,n), each with multiplicity m;. Let the cytoplasmic protein concentrations be [Xi]. This
binding event can be represented as

For simplicity in the discussion that follows, this representation clubs together what are in
fact several independent binding events, and includes effective rate constants ky and k— for


this clubbed reaction. Indeed, there might be several configurations of the bound state: other
combinations in which the DNA can bind these proteins. Let s; represent these various states
(including the one in which the DNA is bare). The probability of occurrence of each state in
thermodynamic equilibrium is then [19]

where k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The term AF is the standard
free energy of the given configuration, describing the energetics of interaction between the
molecules; for example, bonds between DNA and protein residues can stabilize binding by
