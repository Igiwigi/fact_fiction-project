Interestingly, the condition (C 1) translates to the fact that information cannot propagate at a speed
below the smallest discrete velocity of the lattice, and above the maximal one—this condition
is more commonly known as the (Courant, Friedrichs et Lewy) CFL condition. Similarly, the
condition (C 2) translates to the fact that the temperature is bounded by the minimal and maximal
internal energies of discrete velocities. Observing a lower limit for the temperature might be
surprising at first, but in fact, this is exactly what is observed during simulations of both DVMs
and LBMs (figures 1 and 2).

Consequently, by choosing the minimal and maximal norm of discrete velocities, and by
centring the velocity discretization accordingly, researchers from the DVM community are able to
obtain stable simulations that lead to accurate results even for very large velocity and temperature
variations. In this context, the lattice can either be adjusted in a static [29] or dynamic [35] manner.
Interestingly, both approaches share similarities with adaptive LBMs that were proposed by
Sun et al. [102-104] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and recently reinterpreted by Dorschner
et al. [105]. Nevertheless, contrarily to the latter LBMs which suffer from conservation issues
due to space interpolations [106], DVMs rely on finite-volume discretizations of the DVBE, hence
