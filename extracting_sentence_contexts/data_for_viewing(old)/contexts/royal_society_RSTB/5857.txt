path.

It will be noted that the idea of segregation contains two parts: first, that the
process gives rise to parts with new potentialities, as Hoapiry concluded, and secondly;
that it involves a restriction of potentiality from a general to a particular. Liniie

(1929), who has discussed the concept from a general standpoint, defines it as the “ process
of origin of parts of the embryo possessing irreversible prospective value as tested by
self-differentiation,”’ and characterises it as being a process of segregation. The
difficulty here arises that self-differentiation techniques do not in fact test irreversible
prospective value. In Triton the ectoderm can be shown to possess the capacity to
self-differentiation to epidermis, and probably to neural plate, at a stage before it is
restricted to this fate. True irreversible prospective value can only be tested by
interchange experiments. But if segregation is limited to being the process of origin
of parts possessing irreversible prospective value as tested by interchange experiments,
it becomes identical with determination, and it loses the first element mentioned above,
namely, that it is responsible for the origin of parts with new potentialities.

Such new potentialities do in fact arise. Consider a single-stage process of differentia-
tion of a piece of tissue ; for example, the differentiation of neural plate from blastula
ectoderm in Triton. At first the blastula ectoderm is quite indifferent as regards this
process, later it is definitely determined either to become neural plate or not ; only in
