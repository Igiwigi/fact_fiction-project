Q’, R’ of w, each of these curves being augmented by the conic through Aj, ..., A;,
repeated. ‘I'he ®-curves are rational sextics passing through P, Q, R and touching
I at four points of l.

There are four systems of E-curves in § namely :—

(a1), (da), (ds) Cubics which pass through two of the points P, Q, R and which touch I
twice at points of |; these curves fill up the primes [PQ, 1], [QR, 1], [RP, U] and
give rise to these triple base planes of VY’, 01, oe, a3.

(b) Lines which touch I at points of 1; these lie in the «1 tangent planes to I at
points of /, and all such tangent planes form a quadric line-cone K, whose vertex
is | (as appears from the fact that any prime through / contains two of them)
and they are represented in & by the generators of a rational ruled quintic base
surface F,® of ¥.

Neighbourhood of the line l.—If we prescribe the tangent prime for a quadric of ® at
a given point P (0) of J, then the tangent prime is thereby determined at every point
ofl. For the given tangent prime must contain, besides the tangent plane to I at P (0),
say w@ (0), another plane of K,, say w (0), and this will be tangent to I at some point
P (89) of L; also, since this other plane is tangent to the quadric at two points of 1, it
must be tangent to it at every point of /, and the tangent prime at any point of | is
determined, then, by this plane and the tangent plane to | at the point. Thus to points
of the neighbourhood of any point P of / there correspond points of a line 4 of © which
is the same for all points of /. Also to any point P’ (09) of 4 there corresponds the section
