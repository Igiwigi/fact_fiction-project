The distillate is perfectly colourless to the last, and solid, giving, when pressed
with blotting-paper, hardly a trace of oil ; it resembles in its general appearance the
cerotin itself, but has a lower melting-point, about 70* C.

The distillate also contains a larger per-centage of carbon than the snbstance. A
portion, melting at 73* C. and purified by crystallization, gave to analysis carbon 83:20
and hydrogen 14:22 per cent.; but it is very difficult to raise the melting-point
much beyond 73* C. At first, from the constancy of the melting-point, I was led to
think that a new oxygen combination had been formed. I found, however, after-
wards that the melting-point could be raised to 79? C.; that is, the melting-point of
the alcohol, a substance of a lower melting-point remaining behind ; and there can
be little doubt but that part of the cerotin distils oyer unaltered, while another
portion decomposes into solid hydrocarbon and water. I found, in fact, that the
amount of carbon diminished as the melting-point was raised.

Distillation of Chinese Waz.

The Chinese wax is decomposed by heat. When distilled, the distillate consists
of two portions ; a wax acid which forms the earlier portions of the distillate, and a
portion which is not acted on by potash, and from which the acid portion may be
Separated by saponification. The soap requires to be drawn off by a syphon. I will
first give the analysis of the acid, which is undoubtedly the same acid as that pro-
cured by saponification of the wax itself. The melting-point of the acid may, by the
methods pursued in other cases of separation from the soap, purification and crystal-
lization out of ether, be raised to 80*, 81* C., which is probably the true melting-
