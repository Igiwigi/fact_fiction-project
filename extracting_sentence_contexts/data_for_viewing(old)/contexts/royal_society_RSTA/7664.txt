represents a divergent wave field satisfying Maxwell’s equations (2) and (3). When
r’,,17,, and r are expressed in cylindrical coordinates (g, z) it is easily seen from the
first of equations (4) that E, = 0 over the plane z = 0 taken as a perfectly con-
ducting earth in the antenna problem. If we place P at any point on the positive
part of the z-axis such that z> 4 it is easily seen that | = 0, while if z << 4 we

find that

It thus follows from (5) that (7) is the solution appropriate to a sine-wave antenna
of height / when a- 0, and in fact on making use of equations (3) all the properties
of the sine-wave antenna may be deduced from it. The results thus obtained are
identical with those derived from the integration of Hertz’s expression for the
radiation field due to a current element assuming the sinusoidal distribution
implied in equation (8).

It is now readily seen that the expression
