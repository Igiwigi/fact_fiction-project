It could explain why,
in an era that we are still totally mystified by the gravitational forces between quantum systems,
anything resembling a CAI was as yet dismissed. Our general conclusion is that theories including the gravitational force must be further
studied and that classical interpretations of quantum mechanics may then surely be feasible. It
is also a fact that standard arguments using Bell’s theorem do not sufficiently take into account
that correlation functions do not have to vanish at space-like distances. The ‘mouse-dropping
function’ (7.2) displays correlations over space-like distances which are quite normal in physics. A liquid close to its critical point shows critical opalescence, which means that density fluctuations
take place at distance scales in the order of microns, at which visible light is scattered, so that the



correlations are optically visible.
