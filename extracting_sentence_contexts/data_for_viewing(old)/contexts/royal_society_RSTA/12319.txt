It seems therefore clearly demonstrated by these experiments that the metal
palladium is driven towards the centre of the mass in alloys of gold and palladium
in a similar manner, though not perhaps to the same extent, as platinum-gold alloys,
and the experiments shown by the diagrams given prove this fact incontestably.

The methods adopted for the determination of the gold in the respective platinum
and palladium alloys were the following :—

In the alloys of gold, 10 per cent., and platinum, 90 per cent. Two carefully
weighed portions of the alloys to be analysed were weighed and cupelled with two and
three-quarter times their weight of fine silver—in identically the same manner as in
conducting. the process of gold assaying—one of the resulting buttons being then
parted” in nitric acid, and the other by sulphuric acid. In the first instance, the
whole of the platinum dissolves with the silver by employing two distinct treatments
