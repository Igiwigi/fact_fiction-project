reduced in size. When the mouth is opened the aperture of the air-chamber is also
opened, and the air rushes (¢f. arrow Aen. in A) in and fills the air-chamber. When the
mouth is shut this aperture is closed, partly by the intrinsic muscles in its rim and partly
by the floor of the mouth being pressed against the palate. ‘The intrinsic musculature of
the wall of the air-chamber now contracts, and the air is forced through (¢f. arrow Aex.
in A) the minute gill-slits into the opercular chamber and then by the median ventral
opening to the exterior. Occasionally, however, the fish shoots its muzzle above the
water and drives the air out between half-closed lips with a hissing noise.*

The physiological experiments, the results of which I now proceed to describe, were
carried out in the natural habitat of the fish. I camped out on the banks of the rivers

* Regarding the mechanism of respiration in these air-breathing fishes the following facts should be
carefully noticed :—

Tn Clarias the fish lifts its head above the surface of water, opens its mouth and takes a gulp of air. All
this is performed very rapidly, and during this process the ceratobranchials sink backwards and downwards
and the gill-clefts lying between them are closed, whilst at the same time the epibranchials become almost
vertical, and the large anterior slit between the 2nd and 3rd branchial “‘ fans” opens, allowing the air to
pass from the pharynx into the air-chamber. When the mouth is closed the slit between the “ fans ” is
also closed, but when the operculum is lifted up then it releases the posterior slit, viz., between the 3rd and
the 4th “ fans,” and hence allows the escape from its posterior extremity.

In Saccobranchus, however, the Ist and 4th “fans” are very small and they overlap the 2nd and the
3rd “ fans,” thus leaving no slit between the Ist and the 2nd “ fans,” nor between the 3rd and the 4th “ fans,”
