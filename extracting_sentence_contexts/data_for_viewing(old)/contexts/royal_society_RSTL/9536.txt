that is regarding the four functions as the coordinates of a point in ordinary space,
the locus of the point is a surface.

In particular the four functions may be any four functions belonging to a hexad :
by what precedes there is then a linear relation between the squares of the four
functions : or the locus is a quadric surface. Kach hexad gives 15 8uch surfaces, or
the number of quadric surfaces is (16 x 15=) 240.

The 16-nodal quartic $urfaces,

121. Tf the four functions are those contained in any two pairs out of a tetrad of
pairs (8ee the foregoing © Table of the 120 pairs ”), then the locus is a quartic surface,
which is, in fact, a KUMaer's 16-nodal quartic surface. For if for a moment &.y and
2. are two pairs out of a tetrad, and 7.s be either of the remaining pairs of the
tetrad ; then we have 7s a linear function of ay and 2: squaring, 1s? ig a linear
function of a%?, yz, 22%; but we then have 1? and 8, each of them a linear function
of a?, 4f, 22, w?; or substituting we have an equation of the fourth order, containing
terms of the second order in (a?, 4, 2?, u?), and also a term in ayz2w. It is clear that
if instead of 7.5 we had taken the remaining pair of the tetrad we should have obtained
the same quartic equation in (x, y, 2, w). And moreover it appears by inspection
that if zy and 2w are pairs in a tetrad, then zz and yw are pairs in a second tetrad,
and zw and yz are pairs in a third tetrad : we obtain in each case the 8ame quartic
equation. We have from each tetrad of pairs six sets of four functions (ﬆ, y, 2, w):
and the number of such ets is thus (46.30=)60 : these are shown in the foregoing
