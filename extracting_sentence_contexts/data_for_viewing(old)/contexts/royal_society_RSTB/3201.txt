180 MR. R. ASSHETON ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE UNGULATE PLACENTA, AND

I find pigment in the cells at the bases of the villi which may be regarded as an
excretory product (cf elephant). Free iron can be detected in a few places in the
chorion, and more rarely in the villi.

Fat occurs in the uterine milk and in the trophoblast cells.

Clearly the more important part of the nourishment of the embryo is derived from
the secretion by the uterine glands and general uterine epithelium, and by the breaking
down of parts thereof into pabulum which is taken up by the intercotyledonary part
of the chorion. The fact of the accumulation of pigment in the bases of the villi
leads one to suspect that the cotyledonary area is more concerned with excretion and
possibly with respiration than with nutrition.

The Pig.

The history of the first 10 days’ development was published by myself in 1898, in
which account I showed that the embryo during the first 10 days retains its primary
spherical form, but on the 11th day, by which time the blastocysts have become
scattered along the whole length of the uterus, the process of elongation commences
and proceeds with great rapidity, so that by the end of the 14th day they have grown
