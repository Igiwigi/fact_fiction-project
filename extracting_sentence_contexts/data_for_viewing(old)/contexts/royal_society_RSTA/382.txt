Consensus for WSI across each ensemble (figure 2d) is stronger than for MAR.
This suggests that for the majority of river basins, the direction of change in
WSI is very much dependent on the population in the basin, at least for the
2060s population scenario, i.e. depending on the basin, the population numbers
are more important in determining the change in WSI than the spread of values
across the climate ensembles. In fact, for 64 per cent of the river basins driven by
the CPDN ensemble, there is greater than 99 per cent consensus in the direction
of change in WSI for both temperature regimes. This also follows for the CMIP3
ensemble where 74 per cent of the ensemble shows consensus in the direction
of change in WSI for the +2°C world. However, in a small number of river
basins, there is little consensus at either +2°C or +4°C. For this subset of river
basins (where consensus is less than 50%), we have compared AWSI for both the
2030s and 2060s population scenarios (not shown here). We find that there is
no consistent signal in the change in consensus in WSI, for the two population
scenarios, indicating that it is the uncertainty in the climate that dominates AWSI
in these particular basins.
