In this case it might appear that the relative positions of the first order spectra are
not those of the face-centred lattice, but this should be regarded as purely accidental.

The spectra resemble those of zine blende, except that the odd orders of the (100)
spectra and the second order of the (111) spectra are not merely abnormally small,
but have entirely disappeared. These facts are very simply explained. The structure
is obtained in exactly the same way as that of zine blende; but the two lattices are
alike, both being of carbon, and when their influences interfere, the interference is
complete.

Finally, consider the case of fluor-spar (CaF,) for a special reason.

As regards relative positions and intensities the spectra are exactly the same as
those of diamond. If we begin with a face-centred lattice of calcium atoms, we must
so move out from it two similar lattices of fluorine atoms as to obtain the observed
relative intensities. This we do by moving them along the cube diagonal, but
in opposite directions, the distance moved being one quarter of the length of the
diagonal. This gives a highly symmetrical structure. A fluorine atom lies at the
