less, the observations of A, conformed surprisingly well to a theoretical relation assuming
ft = 1-24, particularly in view of the fact that this test was carried out without tilting one of
the end fittings, so that the central angle of twist was larger than in the previous tests. There
was close agreement between the theoretical and experimental buckling moments. 17.
