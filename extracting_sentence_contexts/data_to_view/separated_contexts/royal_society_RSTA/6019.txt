At the same time, the strength curve reveals that pairwise entanglement is much
stronger for central spins than for those at the ends of the chain. This behaviour can be
related to the fact that, for finite systems, factorization starts from the edges, as shown in [59],
resulting hence in zero strength at the boundaries progressively increasing when moving into
the bulk. This means, together with the fact that the graph is fully connected (all degrees are
equal to N â€” 1), that concurrences are actually heterogeneously distributed across the system. Yet, these weights are allocated in such a way that all relative fluctuations at the local level,
quantified by the disparity, are equal. This indicates a high level of symmetry in the state right
before the quantum phase transition, namely, that the single-spin distributions of concurrence
may be very similar for all spins in the chain when appropriately rescaled; this is indeed
confirmed in figure 3d.
