Shortly after-
wards the labral mesoderm again becomes connected with the mesoderm
investing the stomodaeum, and eventually gives rise to the labral musculature. The only other insect, besides Locusta migratoria, in which labral coelomic
cavities have so far been recorded is Carausius morosus (W1ESMANN, 1926),
where also they are evanescent. A difference, however, lies in the fact that
whereas in Carausius the walls of the labral coelomic cavities are connected medially,
in Locusta they are not. Although in no other insects have labral coeloms been
recorded, the existence in the labrum of paired mesodermal masses, which no doubt
represent the vestiges of coelomic cavities, have been shown in some insects. â€˜Thus
Heymons (1895, a) found them in Forficula and Carriere and Burcer (1897) and
STRINDBERG (1915, a) in some Hymenoptera.
