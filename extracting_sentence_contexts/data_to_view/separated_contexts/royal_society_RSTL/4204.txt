Pseudo-orcin may be obtained in still
finer erystals by crystallizing it out of water, in which liquid it is exceedingly soluble,
much more 80 than in spirits. I have obtained it from its aqueous solutions in
curiously truncated pyramids, nearly an inch broad, having a brilliant diamond
lustre. In fact, there are very few organic substances which form more splendid
erystals than psendo-orcin. I sent a quantity of these crystals to Professor MILLER
of Cambridge, who was 80 kind as to determine their measurements and optical pro-
perties. 'The following are the results of his examination :â€”
