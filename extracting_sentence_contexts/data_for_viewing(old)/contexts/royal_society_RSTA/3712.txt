we find a behaviour similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in fluids: the displacement is
concentrated at the interface of the two layers, forming a marginally stable undulation.

Let Ah denote here the maximum vertical distance of the points on the interface between the
two layers and let A/ be the horizontal distance between the points which have initial coordinates
(4/4, Ha) and (3/44, Hq), so that Al/â€™ = 0.5 if y > yer. In figure 10, we show the nonlinear evolution
of such morphological parameters as a function of y. As in the previous case, we measured the
quantity Ah decreasing the parameter y, and found a continuous increase in the height of the
undulation, as reported in figure 10a. We highlight that the normalized thickness Al/A strongly
depends on the parameter aj, as we can see from figure 10b.


In fact, for thin soft layers the undulation decreases its width while decreasing y beyond its
critical value, thus forming a digitation. Conversely, the undulation width increases for thick top
layers, thus forming a stable wrinkle. In summary, AI/d increases if the top layer is sufficiently
thin, while it decreases if the top layer is above a critical thickness. In both cases, the resulting
morphology is perfectly reversible after cyclic variations of the order parameters, highlighting
the presence of a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation.

5. Discussion and concluding remarks

In this work, we used theoretical and computational tools to investigate the stability of a soft
elastic bilayer subjected only to the bulk gravity force.

Assuming that both layers are made of incompressible neo-Hookean materials, we first
