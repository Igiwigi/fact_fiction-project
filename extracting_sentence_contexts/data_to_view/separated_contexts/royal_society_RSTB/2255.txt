1, In the fore-limb of the dog the nerve supply of the flexor muscles may be crossed
with that of the extensor muscles, with the result that, despite the altered innerva-
tion, the animal regains, as before, the power of performing voluntary co-ordinated
movements of the limb. 2. The fact of crossing the nerves does not add materially to the time which would
be required for recovery of function of the limb, if the same nerves were simply
divided and reunited by suture as accurately as possible. 3. The result of crossing the nerve supply of antagonistic groups of muscles is that
the nerve centres which formerly innervated the one group now serve for the other
group, and this alteration extends to the cerebral cortical centres, which become
interchanged in position and retain their irritability.
