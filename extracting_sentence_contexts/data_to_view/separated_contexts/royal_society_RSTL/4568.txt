The assistance which a knowledge of liquid diffusion will afford in the investi-
gation of endosmose. When the diffusibility of the salts in a liquid is known, the
compound effect presented in an endosmotic experiment may be analysed, and the
true share of the membrane in the result be ascertained. But on the mere threshold of s0 wide a subject as liquid diffusion, I must postpone
speculation to the determination of new facts and the enlargement of my data, of the
present incompleteness of which I am fully sensible.
