came into use, every pairing was noted, and it soon became evident that many
matings were sterile. As this observation was first made on members of families
which had been inbred for several generations, the cause seemed fairly obvious ; later,
however, fresh strains were obtained, and still there was a high percentage of sterile
matings. The distribution of such matings can be most easily realised by following
the table on p. 253. It begins with pairings made among broods 27-32, of which
many were sterile, but four resulted in a further generation, comprising broods 33-36.
It was then assumed that the strain was becoming degenerate, and a number of
fertile wild females were caught, from which arose broods 37-42. Among these
broods a large number of pairings were made, while there were also matings into
which individuals from broods 33-36 entered, and others with insects reared from
captured larvee. In all, 34 pairings were recorded, and of these only 15 were fertile,
so that the percentage of sterile matings exceeded 50 per cent., in spite of the fact
that the individuals concerned were unrelated.

Of the 15 fertile matings, 4 were discarded and the remainder produced broods 43-53 ;
13 matings were made in this, the F, generation, in captivity,* and all were fertile, a
very marked contrast to the preceding generation. In the F; generation, 17 matings
were made, of which 2 were sterile, 1 pair escaped, and the remainder were fertile,
giving broods 67-78.7 In this generation 8 pairings were made, and of these 4 were
sterile, the remainder yielding broods 79-82, which formed the last generation.

These statistics appear to show clearly that many of the sterile matings could not
have been due to inbreeding. The next hypothesis considered was that they were due
the effects of captivity. This again was unsatisfactory, for, in the first place, it has
