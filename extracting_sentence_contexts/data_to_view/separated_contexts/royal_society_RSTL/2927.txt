The same reasons, founded on the experiments in this memoir, which disprove the
theory of AcviLonivs, induce me to reject the law of corresponding points as an ac-
curate expression of the phenomena of single vision. According to the former, oh-
jects can appear single only in the plane of the koropter; according to the latter, only
when they are in the circle of single vision ; both positions are inconsistent with the
binocular vision of objects in relief, the points of which they consist appearing single
though they are at different distances before the eyes. I have already proved that
the assumption made by all the maintainers of the theory of corresponding points,
namely that the two pictures projected by any object in the retinz are exactly similar,
is quite contrary to fact in every case except that in which the optic axes are parallel. GassExDus, Porta, 'TacqQuer and GaLL maintained, that we see with only one eye
at a time though both remain open, one according to' them being relaxed and inat-
tentive to objects while the other is upon the stretch. It is a sufficient refatation of
this hypothesis, that we see an object double when one of the optic axes is displaced
either by s8quinting or by pressure on the eye-ball with the finger; if we saw with
only one eye, one object only should under snch circumstances be seen.
