The usual practice of considering the field as only influenced
by the earth and controlling magnet, and of regarding the suspended magnet as
without influence, is fallacious. The direction of the lines of force depends on three
things, the earth, the controlling magnet, and the suspending magnet. MAXweELt’s
diagram. fig. 15, represents the case of the discovery well, but the matter is compli-
cated by the fact that the resultant field of earth and control magnet is far from
uniform even before it is distorted by the suspended magnet.

[t seemed likely that much of the difficulty would be removed by making the
residual field more uniform, and with this object two additional and similar control
magnets were introduced below the suspended system, and adjusted by trial till they
were as nearly as possible symmetrically placed with respect to it and the upper
adjustable system. The magnets were of the dimensions and at the distances shown
in the drawing (figs. 1 and 2), and it was expected that they would produce a field of
surface uniformity sufficient for the purpose, after the manner that the HetmHorrz
coil arrangement produces a solid uniformity (MAXWELL, vol. 2, fig. 19). The arrange-
ment figured was set up as a trial, but as its success was immediate and complete,
we never went on to the selection of magnets of proper length—a step we expected
to have to take.
