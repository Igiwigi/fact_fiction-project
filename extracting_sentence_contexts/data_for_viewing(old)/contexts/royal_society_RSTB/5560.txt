detailed examination of other small-leaved Early Devonian plants. Any full discussion
of the questions on which the new data bear would be premature until the corresponding
features of these other remains have been ascertained. All that can be done at present
is to comment briefly on the directions in which some of the observations recorded here
seem to point.

The details as to the appendages borne on the markedly spiny stems from Gaspé
are of interest for themselves and also provide characters that may be of use in com-
parative morphology. The observations made on the well-preserved spines have not
only confirmed previous statements as to their being flattened in the vertical plane, but
have added some structural details. No evidence is forthcoming that the appendages
had a vascular supply, though the nature of the preservation does not justify a definite
negative conclusion on this point. The fact that no stomata have been found, although
the pattern of elongated epidermal cells was more or less evident, supports the view that
stomata were absent from the spines. These negative observations are confirmatory
of views that have been expressed by previous investigators (HALLE, 1916; Epwarps,
1924) that these structures were not specialised organs of assimilation and should be
regarded as ‘‘ emergences”’ rather than “ leaves.”

Some other facts give further support to this view. One is the apparent irregularity
of position of the spines, and especially the way in which examples of the most diverse
