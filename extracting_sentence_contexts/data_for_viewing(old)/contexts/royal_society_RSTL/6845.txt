Nerve-cells, which bear such different relations to nerve-fibres as must exist in the case
of the cell unconnected with any fibre at all, the cell connected with one, and that
connected with more than one fibre, cannot possibly influence the fibres in precisely the
same manner. The suppoxition of such an anatomical arrangement inyolyes the exist-
ence of different principles of action.

544 PROFESSOR BEALE ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE $80-CALLED

There are, however, authorities who consider it consistent with many facts they haye
themselves observed, or accepted as having been demonstrated by others, that the
arrangement of different parts of the neryous system may be upon a totally different
type—that, for example, in some central parts nerves may be in bodily connexion with
the cells that influence them, while in other cases a fibre may be influenced by a cell
with which it is not structurally connected, and that in some tissues nerves may termi-
nate in distinct ends, while in others they form networks, and in others again terminate
in © cells.” A high authority, Professor K6L11KER, only last year suggested to me that,
although it might be true that nerve-fibres formed plexnses or networks in the muscles
of the mouse, it did not therefore follow that they did not terminate in free ends in the
muscles of the frog, although no essential difference in minute structure, or different
principle of action, is known to exist in the muscular tissue of these animals.
