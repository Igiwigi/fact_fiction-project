The
reciprocal, broad x cruciate, from the same two parental plants, gave only three
offspring, all with broad petals 11-12 x 14 mm. One further cross was made, between two members of the cruciate strain from
Charny (71Â°34 x 47.33). This cross was made possible by the fact that many
plants from the 1933 culture only flowered in 1934. The seed parent had cruciate
and the pollen parent broad petals. It yielded 14 uniform plants having the bright
red midribs of the Charny strain, 5 of which had cruciate flowers, 5 had broad
petals, and 4 were intermediate.
