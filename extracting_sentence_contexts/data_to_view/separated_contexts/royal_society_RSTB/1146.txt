It is evident that the discrimination of these different factors can only be achieved
by careful comparative experiments made upon the cord, when its direct connections
with the roots having been interrupted, the centres are placed under different
conditions as regards excitability. These experiments have not as yet been suffi-
ciently satisfactory to enable us to form any decisive opinion on this point. There is, however, one very important fact already referred to at the close of the
preceding Chapter X., to which we must now draw attention. It will be remembered that, on comparing the results of the experiments detailed
in Chapters IX. and X. respectively, the inference was suggested that the indirect
channels by which the cord communicates with the posterior roots, are of such a
character that they offer more resistance to the passages of impulses from the cord to
the nerve than to the passage of similarly evoked impulses from the nerve to the
cord.
