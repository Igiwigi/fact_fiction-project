Evidently such coarse lamin do not produce the effects of Type 2 but
there is no a priori reason against the occurrence of a lamellar structure finer than either
of these, though not so fine as would be included between two molecular or cleavage
planes. Indeed, the results seem to point to some such “ staggering ” of thin lamellar
growths. This appears to be perfectly in line with the conclusions arrived at by Wi.t1aMs,
who says (op. cit., vol. 2, page 462) that “A very careful study has been made of
diamonds showing this phenomenon (glide planes) and all evidence definitely points to
the fact that the striee have been produced by stress only,” and he points to one of his
photomicrographs (Plate 166) where the growth projections on the face of the octahedron
have been actually shifted on a plane parallel to the octahedral face. Spacing of Lamina. Attempts have been made in two ways to evaluate the distance of the laming: from
one another.
