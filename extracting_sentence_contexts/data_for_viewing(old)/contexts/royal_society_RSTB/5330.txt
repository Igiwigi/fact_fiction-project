Discoidea genital 5 is as large as genitals 1,3 or 4 and sometimes has a genital pore

(Hawkins, 1912, d, fig. 59 @), sometimes has no pore (BATHER, 1900, fig. XI, 4). In the
former figure all the genitals are pierced by water pores, and Hawkrns regards this as

“the preliminary stages of the assimilation of the genitals—a phenomenon that is
preparatory to their coalescence and fusion in the Clypeastroida ” (p. 481).

Two facts tend to support Hawxins’ view that the Clypeastroid apical system
evolved from that of, e.g., Discoidea, namely, (1) that some Clypeastroids, e.g., Echin-
arachnius, possess four genital pores, while some, e.g. Clypeaster and Echinanthus, have
five ; (2) genitals 4 and 2 + plate x do seem to fuse to form the pentagonal plate in the
apical system of Echinarachnius. But his hypothesis is considerably: weakened by
the following facts. (1) Genital 5 is absent in the Clypeastroid which has been studied
—the spicule from which it should develop is, of course, present since it is essential
to the larva throughout its free swimming life, but it is resorbed with surprising rapidity
at metamorphosis. This seems to show that genital 5 disappeared early in the phylo-
genetic sequence. (2) Genitals 1 and 3 have also disappeared. It is unlikely that
genital 5, once lost as Hawkins postulates, should have been reacquired only to be
lost again.
