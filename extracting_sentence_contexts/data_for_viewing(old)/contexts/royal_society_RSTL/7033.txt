the high-level gravels and low-level grayels, and shown that the former were older
than the latter. I was, however, at one time disposed to adopt in part some of the
views of M. ELtt DE BEAUMONT with respect to the operation of cataclysmic action in
preference to the slower action of rivers; but further research, and the discovery of
land and freshwater shells in so great a number of low-level gravels, and in some of
the high-level gravels, and especially the striking evidence eventually afforded by the
beds of St. Acheul, and by the higher-level gravels around Paris*, satisfied me that
river-action peculiar to each valley commenced with the high-level gravels, while the
mass of d6bris and the large blocks present in the beds indicate the action of a large
volume of water and of ice-transport. Further, I was ultimately led to connect the
Loess with both series of valley-gravels, and the frequent independence of the former,
which at first seemed an irreconcileable difficulty, finally proved an important auxiliary
fact; for the separate range of this deposit now serves as a measure of the old flood
waters, and of the extent of the river inundations during this quaternary period.

I conceive that the hypothesis brought forward in this paper gives consistency to the
whole subject. It brings down the large mammalia to a period subsequent to that when
the extreme glacial conditions prevailed, and closer to our own times ; it places all the
old river alluvia in the same period, and groups together the previously isolated fluvia-
tile beds of Grays, Brentford, and other places in England, together with the Loess
and various © Sables lacustres” and © diluyiums” (part) of the French authors; it con-
nects the great platform terraces of gravel skirting s0 many of our river-valleys with
the same period, and makes the connexion between these, and the excavation of the
yalleys themselves and the formation of the Loess, dependent upon one prolonged and
uniform set of operations, in accordance with the climatal conditions and necessarily
