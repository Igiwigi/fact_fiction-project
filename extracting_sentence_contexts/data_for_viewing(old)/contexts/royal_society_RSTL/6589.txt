480 MR. A. COHEN ON THE DIFFERENTIAL COEFFICIENTS

resultant couple is the complete swm of the axes of two component couples. Therefore,
substituting for those axes the equivalent determinants, we see that the determinant of
(P)+(P') to Q is the complete sum of the determinant of P to Q, and of the deter-
minant of P' to Q. Thus we have

det (P, Q)-det;(P', Q)=det {(P)} (PQ i-mode als nn ne ins AY
And it may similarly be shown that

aet((P,Q)—det (P'Q)=det {(P)=(P'), Q}-7 0h nh nn nn 1 (LE)
The same proposition follows also easily from a consideration of the linear expressions
(11.) in section 24 for the projections of a determinant, and is in fact equivalent to a
fundamental theorem concerning algebraic determinants, which theorem may be found
in Sa1Mox's © Lessons on Higher Algebra,” section 19, page 9.

27. The proposition proved in the last section will be found to be of constant use in
explaining and shortening analytical processes in mechanics. One useful application can
be made of it in proving © the parallelogram of angular velocities.” For taking Q to be
the radius vector of a particle, and P and P' to represent two axes and angular velocities
of rotation then the formula (I.) of the last section translates itself at once by means of
section 25 into the following proposition :—© The linear velocity of a particle due to a
rotation whose axis and angular velocity are represented by the line P, compounded
with the linear velocity due to a rotation similarly represented by the line P', is equiva-
lent to the linear velocity due to a rotation represented by the complete sum of P and
