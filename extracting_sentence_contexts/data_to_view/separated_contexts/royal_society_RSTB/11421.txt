Conclusion and recommendations

Modern children have limited access to realistic information
about death and dying. Alongside socio-cultural trends that
have removed death from everyday life, many adults endorse
attitudes of shielding children from the reality of death. Further-
more, it appears that parents tend to underestimate what their
children know about death, and often discuss the topic using
euphemisms that actually contradict the biological facts. While media exposure is an increasing influence on children’s
learning, there is no research to date investigating how media
portrayals influence children’s developing death concepts. Drawing together the limited evidence reviewed above,
and the advice of bereavement experts and clinicians, the fol-
lowing tentative recommendations about how to teach
modern children about death and dying can be made:

Parents, educators and other influential adults should
ensure that young children have exposure to nature and ani-
mals, as these sorts of experiences promote children’s
understanding of biological concepts [30].
