Dynamin is a GTPase motor and its constriction a
is essential for cell events such as endocytosis and organelle division. However, the mechanism of [Ss
constriction and twist by the dynamin helix has been thoroughly debated. The complexity arises
from the fact that the dynamin polymer has both contractile and torsional abilities, involving
changes of contiguous dimers at the molecular level but also at the whole polymer levelâ€”changes
not accessible by standard structural biology tools. HS-AFM allowed the visualization of the
constriction of single dynamin-coated membrane tubules [81,82], showing the distance between
the helix turns and between dimers along the polymer. These distances were shown to vary
over time, as helical turns were observed to transiently pair and dissociate.
