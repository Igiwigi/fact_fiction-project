This action, which we have hitherto
been disposed to attribute to the mobility of hydrogen, and its consequent high con-
vective power, Professxor MAGNUS was led to regard as an effect of conduction ; and the
thought induced him to examine the conductibility of gases generally. The mode of

but to results substantially the same as those that T had previously obtained. In fact
