greater amount of energy is liberated, in consequence of some change in the molecular
state of the ventricular musecle associated with increased tension at the commencement
and during the early stages of its contraction. This is the supposition adopted for
ordinary muscle ; as FosTtR states it, ©* the tension of the muscular fibre. increases the
facility with which the explosive changes resulting in a contraction take place ” (Physiol.,
1883, p. 88). The difference between the two muscles is that for the heart musele
the energy liberated as external work bears a direct proportion to the tension exerted
by the load, while for ordinary musele this is not true. The lift of an ordinary
muscle when contracting is represented, in the case of the heart muscle, by the extent of
the contraction, measured by the volume of blood ejected, Since within the range of
arterial pressures given the volume of blood thrown out at each systole remains the
game, it follows that the extent of the contraction is unchanged. The most probable
interpretation of this fact is that the contraction in each case is maximal, and
completely empties the ventricular cavity; a conclusion which is in accordance with
the work of Bowpircn, KronEgckE, and others on the isolated Frog's heart.

A curve of work constructed upon the arterial pressures as abscissas, and. the work

* done at each beat of the ventricle under these pressures as ordinates, would, within the

limits for which we have investigated it, be a straight line. Owing to the sources of
