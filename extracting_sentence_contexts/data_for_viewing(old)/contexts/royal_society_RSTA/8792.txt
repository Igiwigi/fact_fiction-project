oscillation. It is H.W. at Mull of Cantyre at 10h. 58m. At Red Bay, on the Irish
Coast, it is H.W. at 10h. 55m. The co-tidal line for 10h, 55m., therefore, runs from
the Mull of Cantyre to Red Bay, and it is for this reason that it has been chosen for
the section RC (see fig. 3) along which the integral for Wyo (the energy which flows
across RC) will be taken. Since the streams change direction at H.W., Dover, 7.e., at
11h. 7m., the phase difference between the tidal stream and the height of the tide is
only 12m. of time short of the quarter period, i.e., 87° expressed as an angle.

The maximum current runs through the North Channel at a rate of 4 knots. The
rise and fall of tide in the North Channel is very small ; at Red Bay it is 4 feet, and
at Ballycastle Bay, to the N.W. of Red Bay, it is only 3 feet. At the Mull of
Cantyre it is also 4 feet. The equality of the heights of the tide on the two sides of
the channel is probably due to the. fact that, at the times the stream is running at its
maximum speed, when therefore we should expect the maximum difference in level on
the two sides of the Channel owing to geostrophic force, the water is at its mean
level. At H.W. and L.W. the streams are slack, so that no geostrophic effect is to be
anticipated at those times.
