The graduation of the yernier was s0 arranged as to
permit of the employment of plates of gas varying from 0-01 to 2'8 inches in thickness.
'They were afterwards continued with the pieces of the experimental tube, already re-
ferred to, and in this way layers of gas were examined which varied in thickness in the
ratio of 1: 4900. In my former experiments the chamber F was always kept exhausted, s0 that the rays
of heat passed immediately from the source through a vacuum ; but in the present
instance I feared the strain upon the plate S, and I also feared the possible intrusion of a
small quantity of the gas under examination into the front chamber F, if the latter were
kept exhausted. Having established the fact that a length of 8 inches of dry air exerts
no sensible action on the rays of heat, I had no scruple in filling the chamber F with dry
air, Its absorption was 777, and it merely had the effect of lowering in an infinitesimal
degree the temperature of the source. The two stopcocks c and c' stand exactly opposite
the junction of the two plates of salt S, S' when they are in contact, and when they are
drawn apart these cocks are in communication with the space between the plates. After many trials, the following mode of experiment was adopted :—The gas-holder
containing the gas to be examined was connected by an india-rubber tube with the
cock c, the other cock c being at the same time left open, The piston was then moved
by the screw R until the requisite distance between the plates was obtained.
