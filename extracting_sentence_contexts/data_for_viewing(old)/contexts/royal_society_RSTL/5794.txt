of the body go on then as usual, these cases appear to proye absolutely that the forces
which are concerned in the mutual interchanges between the tissnes and the nutrient ,
fluid do not cause any movement whatever.

But even supposing that it were admitted, for the 8ake of argument, that the vital
affinities do, under ordinary circumstances, cause 80me movement of the blood, but lose
that power in an animal under chloroform, such an admission would hardly affect the
discussion regarding the cause of stagnation in inflammation ; for in a frog fully under
the influence of the anzsthetic, in which, as we have seen, the heart is the only cause
of circulation, all the phenomena that result from irritation of the web take place pre-
cisely in the same manner as in one to which the narcotic has not been administered.
The fact that the heart, even though much enfeebled by chloroform, is capable, un-
aided by any other force, of maintaining the circulation for an indefinite period without
the occurrence of obstruction in the capillaries, or any undue accumulation of cor-
puscles in them, affords positive proof that any other cause of movement which may be
conceived to exist when chloroform has not been given, must be altogether insignificant,
and that the cessation of its operation does not give rise to stagnation of the bloodÂ®.

The veins of the frog's web afford very little evidence of contractility; but a small
amount of unstripgd muscular tissue, transversely arranged, is distinctly to be seen in
the larger venous branches; and on one occasion I obseryed a very considerable degree
of local contraction, as measured from the outer borders of the external coat of a vein
running through a small area which I had pinched forcibly with forceps. I have also
