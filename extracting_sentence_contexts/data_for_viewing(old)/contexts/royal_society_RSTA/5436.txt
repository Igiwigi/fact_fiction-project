— Powder lubricants and, in particular, boric acid lubricants. In general,
hese tend to be much more ecologically friendly than the traditional liquid
ubricants (Kabir et al. 2008). Boric acid and MoS, powder can also be used

as an additive to the natural oil. Friction and wear experiments show that
he nanoscale (20nm) particle boric acid additive lubricants significantly
outperformed all of the other lubricants with respect to frictional and wear
yerformance. In fact, the nanoscale boric acid powder-based lubricants
exhibited a wear rate more than an order of magnitude lower than the
loS2 and larger sized boric acid additive-based lubricants (M. R. Lovell,
{. A. Kabir, P. L. Menezes & C. F. Higgs 2010, personal communication).

— Self-replenishing lubrication that uses oil-free environmentally benign
powders for lubrication of critical components such as bearings used in
uel cell compressors and expanders (Wornyoh et al. 2007).

(c) Renewable energy

The tribology of renewable sources of energy is a relatively new field of
ribology. Today, there are meetings and sections devoted to the tribology of
