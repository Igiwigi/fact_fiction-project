A. roll of bibulous paper, taken from one of the drawers of the labo-
ratory, and to all appearance perfectly dry, was enclosed in a glass tube, and dry air
carried between its leaves. The experiment was made five times in succession with the
same paper, and the following absorptions were observed :;â€”

In fact, the action of aqueous vapour is exactly 8uch as might be expected from the
vapour of a liquid which MEgrLLoxt found to be the most powerful absorber of radiant
heat of all he had examined,

Every morning, on commencing my experiments, T had an interesting example of the
power of glass to gather a film of aqueous vapour on its surface. Suppose the tube
mounted, and the air of the laboratory removed as far as the air-pump was capable of
removing it. On allowing dry air to enter for the first time, the needle would move
from 0* to 50*.
