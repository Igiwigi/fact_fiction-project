More than 70 years after Rivlin initiated the topic, there is still huge research activity and
effort devoted to the quest of the strain-energy for natural rubber. There has been and still is
a continuous flow of new models for rubber coming out in the literature, to be confronted by
experimental data, which is puzzling because a mathematical model must be robust and general,
and cannot rely on a single specific functional form only.

The starting point of the Mooney-Rivlin model can be found in the original paper by
Mooney [6]:

When a sample of soft rubber is stretched by an imposed tension, neither the force-
elongation nor the stress-elongation relationship agrees with Hooke’s law. But, if the sample
is sheared by a shearing stress, or traction, Hooke’s law is obeyed over a very wide range in
deformation. ... Another simplifying feature in the elasticity of rubber lies in the fact that
deformations are normally produced without any appreciable change in volume.

Rivlin was able to substantiate this point of view by clarifying several theoretical and
experimental aspects of rubber mechanics. He produced the mathematical model (3.1), which
‘led to the exploration of the nonlinear theory of elasticity in deep and unexpected ways, yielded
significative classes of non-homogeneous exact solutions and provided a new perspective to the
interpretation of experimental data’ [7]. Its applicability holds quite widely, even though the
Mooney-Rivlin model is special in several respects. For instance, it is only an example among
a huge family of models that possesses the requirements given by Mooney [8]; its mathematical
structure leads to predictions that are too restrictive (finite-amplitude transverse waves should
obey linear propagation laws); and the comparison with experiments is good only for a restricted
range of deformation.
