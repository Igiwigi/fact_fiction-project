Real progress in understanding how the natural world works only truly began with the
Enlightenment, with its guiding principle that the truth is to be found not by appeal to
authority but by experimental tests and evidence. Unfortunately, but understandably,
science is too often seenâ€”in school, in university and especially on quiz shows
certainty. In fact, science (including social sciences, engineering and medicine along with
the more narrowly defined physical and biological sciences) is better seen as organized
scepticism: a journey, over time, toward contingent understanding guided by experimental
tests and sceptical questioning. Essentially all such journeys are beset by uncertainties
of various kinds. This article sketches some of the consequent problems, particularly in
relation to science advice, policy making and public engagement.
