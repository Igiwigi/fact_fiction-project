diately after the death of the animal. All argument, however, must give way to obser-
vation ; and even if the results of obseryation are incompatible with conclusions previously
regarded as true, the new facts must be receiyed, and our inferences must be modified
accordingly. But, on the other hand, it will be admitted, in an anatomical inquiry like
the present, that there may be the greatest difference of opinion as to the actual demon-
stration. The ends which one observer may consider to be natural terminations, by
another may be held to be merely apparent ends, depending upon our being unable to
see the continuation of the fibre in consequence of its extreme tennity. The importance
which all observers attach to the process of preparation they follow, is alone sufficient to
show that the appearances produced are yery different according to the manner in which
a specimen is examined ; and further, it is quite certain that many points to be readily
demonstrated by one process, are quite invisible when another plan is followed. This is
one explanation of the many conflicting statements as to facts of observation.

In a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1860, I was led to conclude
that many of the 80-called connective-tissue corpuscles observed upon the muscular fibres
were connected Ã¾by very delicate granular fibres nearly as wide as the corpuscles, but
only to be seen in specimens preserved in fluids which refracted very highly ; and I also
satisfied myself that these fibres were continuous with the nerve-fibres; and I stated that
the nerve-fibres ramified with the capillaries external to the sarcolemma. My conclusions
were terribly at variance with those of other observers ; for not only was I compelled to
infer (1) that the nerye-fibres formed, as it were, a network over the muscular fibres, but
(2) that every muscular fibre was supplied with nerves throughout its entire length. It
is usually maintained, 1st, that nerve-fibres terminate in free ends on the muscle; 2nd,
that nerve-fibres only come into contact with the muscular fibre at yery distant points:
