The fibres used by Barnerr were,
however, all prepared from one crystal of quartz, and the results obtained would
therefore be expected to be more uniform,

Barnett also made observations to determine if there was any change of rigidity
with time. Experiments extending over an interval of four months failed to detect
any alteration, The present experiments show that with more accurate timing of
the torsional oscillations, variations in the rigidity can be detected, and that, when a
fibre is allowed to rest at the ordinary temperature of the laboratory, its rigidity
increases slightly. The increase of rigidity with time is, however, not so marked in
the case of quartz as it was found to be with metal wires, and the reason for this
may possibly lie in the fact that the structure of fused quartz is amorphous, while

* It is, of course, well known that the tensile strength of metal wires also increases as their diameter is
decreased,
