Furthermore, traditional burial practices were forbidden
to reduce exposure to infected bodies (box 3). However, this
violation of cultural beliefs bred fear that the deceased and
their relatives would be cursed for failing to perform a
proper ceremony. The unfamiliar sight of workers wearing
full protective clothing heightened tensions; fear reached a
climax when riots broke out in N’Zérékoré after rumours
spread that medics disinfecting a market were in fact con-
taminating people [34]. Tragically, in September 2014 eight
members of a healthcare team were murdered by residents
of Womey near N’Zérékoré [34-36]. Data during this early phase of the outbreak were irregu-
larly collected and resources were focused on providing
clinical care.
