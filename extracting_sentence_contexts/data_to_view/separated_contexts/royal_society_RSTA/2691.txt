Confirmatory evidence is also afforded from the facts that
the relationships between the constants are of a similar kind to those found in the
alkalies and that the limit of the Principal series (S-sequence) is the same as the
variable part of the first line of the Sharp whilst that of the Sharp is not rigorously
the same as the variable part of the first line of the Principal. In other words, VP
and VS denoting sequences, the limit of the Principal series is VP (1), whilst that for
the Sharp series deviates considerably from VS (1). This fact renders the notation of
the sequences introduced in Part I. confusing. The confusion may, however, to some
extent be avoided if small letters are used to denote sequences and large letters the
lines or series. Thus, in these elements VP (im) = s(m) and VS (m) = p (m).
