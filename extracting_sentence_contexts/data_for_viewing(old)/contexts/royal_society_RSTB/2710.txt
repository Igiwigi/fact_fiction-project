This spring a market gardener, whose cucumbers had suffered severely from the
Cercospora last season, brought some cucumber plants to Kew, which he was afraid
were attacked by the same disease. Examination showed that the plants were not
attacked by Cercospora melonis, but by a fungus called Dendryphium comosum.
The injury caused by the Dendryphiwm has now assumed the proportions of an
epidemic in the cucumber houses of this particular market gardener, but is not
recorded under such circumstances from elsewhere. Now Dendryphium comosum is
a well-known saprophyte, growing on decaying vegetable matter, but its occurrence
as a parasite has never before been recorded.

A careful examination as to the origin of the outbreak of the epidemic caused by
Dendryphium revealed the fact that the young cucumber plants were growing in a
mixture of two thirds loam and one-third of stable manure. Further, the portions
of half-decomposed straw from the manure that projected above the surface of the
soil, were covered with a copious growth of Dendryphium. The fungus had been
introduced with the manure.

Dendryphium spores from the manure, when placed in a drop of water on the
under surface of living cucumber leaves, produced the disease. The germ-tubes of
the spores were positively chemotactic to a decoction of expressed juice from cucumber
leaves, but failed to respond chemotactically to the expressed juice of twelve other
plants selected at random and representing seven natural orders.

The above I consider to demonstrate the presence of a latent powerâ€”that of being
