At the node shown in text-fig. 1, several vascular bundles are present, leaving the
stele or traversing the cortex. The exact course of the leaf-traces, however, is
obscure, and this is one of the points which must be left open till more favourable
specimens are available. The fact that bundles are seen leaving the stele suggests
that the section shown in text-fig. 1 was cut rather below the node, and, therefore,
that the appendages shown are the dorsal lobes. This is not, however, quite certain,
for, from the radial section (phot. 9), it is evident that the bundles of the dorsal and
ventral lobes can only have joined quite close to the stele, and it is even possible that
they may have sprung from it independently. The relative number and position of the dorsal and ventral lobes could not be
determined.
