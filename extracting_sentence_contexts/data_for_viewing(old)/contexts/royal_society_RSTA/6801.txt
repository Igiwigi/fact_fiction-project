560 J. R. GREEN AND R. V. SOUTHWELL ON RELAXATION

accepted solution for 4 — 0, i.e. with a value of A calculated from the right-hand side
of (54) and so higher than what would be given by the right-hand side of (58). This
overestimate, corrected in the manner of §18, led to successive estimates which are
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The convergence is oscillatory, but the last two estimates are
nearly identical.

Next, on the basis of this solution for A = 2, the case A = 4 was started. Curve C was thus
available, and in figure 8 the point for A = 4 numbered 1 gives a starting estimate
based on the first of (59). (A closer starting estimate could have been based on curve D
if this had been available.) Again the convergence is oscillatory but rapid. The case
A = 3 was in fact treated last, though it might have preceded the case A — 4.

26. In figure 8 the broken-line curve (‘final A for given A’) is compared with ‘exact?
results, taken from (F. & S. 1941),* which are shown by open circles. The agreement
throughout the range (which more than covers all cases having practical reality) is as
close as could be desired.

Table 4 records the co-ordinates of the open circles in figure 8.
