The minimum observed was 58 %, and the only two series which


PLASMA CELLS AND LYMPHOCYTES IN HOMOGRAFTS 499

showed no definite destruction during the experiments failed to attain this percentage,
one of them being the massively infiltrated series 1304. The percentage of immature plasma
cells might therefore be of use as an index of the progress of the host reaction against the
graft. The fact that the plasma cell response may be a characteristic of the individual
would not necessarily affect it, but a low concentration of the cells would probably make
it less reliable. I would particularly like to express my thanks to Professor P. B.
