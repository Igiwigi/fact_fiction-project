Accordingly the goat’s brain is more brachycephalic
than that of the pig, while the donkey’s brain even has an index of 95. Of the Carnivores mentioned Ursus malayanus has the largest cephalisation coefficient
((0-75), about twice as large as in Viverride and dogs and one and a half times larger
than in the Nasue). In harmony with this is the fact that notwithstanding the taller
body size of Ursus its brain-index is larger than that of the other Carnivores mentioned
in the table. * To make the comparison accurate the animals should not differ in body size.
