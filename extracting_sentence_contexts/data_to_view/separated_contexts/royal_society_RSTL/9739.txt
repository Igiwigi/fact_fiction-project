© It is obvious that different seasons will differ almost
infinitely at each succeeding period of their advance, and that, with each variation, the
character of development of the plant will also vary, tending to luxuriance, or t0
maturation, that is, to quantity, or to quality, as the case may be. Hence, only a
very detailed consideration of climatic statistics, taken together with careful periodic
observations in the field, can afford a really clear perception of the connexion between
the ever-fluctuating characters of season and the equally fluctuating characters of
growth and produce. It is, in fact, the distribution of the various elements making
up the season, their mutual adaptations, and their adaptation to the stage of growth
of the plant, which throughout influence the tendency to produce quantity or quality. It not unfrequently happens, too, that some passing conditions, nob indicated by a
summary of the meteorological registry, may affect the crop very strikingly ; and thus
the cause will be overlooked, unless careful observations be also made, and the stage of
progress, and tendencies of growth, of the crop itself at the time, be likewise taken into
account.” Again : © Those characters of season which are very unfavourable for land
in poor condition, may be favourable to land in high condition, and vice versd.”


EXPERIMENTS ON THE MIXED HERBAGE OF PERMANENT MEADOW, 391

Tf 8uch be the difficulty and the intricacy of the subject when the growth of a crop
consisting of a single species only is concerned, how much more difficult and intricate
must it be when we have to deal with the relations of the various climatal conditions
to the development of a great variety of species growing together, as in the case of the
mixed herbage, and numbering, as they do, under 20, or 50 or more, according to the
varied manurial conditions provided !?
