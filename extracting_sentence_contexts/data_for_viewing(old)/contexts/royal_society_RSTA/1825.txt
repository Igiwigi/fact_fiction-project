relationships between the habitat of the bacterial strains (sea ice bottom versus water column)
and their capacity to use the different exudates. One hypothesis for this lack of relationship
between microbial habitat and microalgal DOM could be cross-feeding, meaning the production
of secondary compounds based on the degradation of microalgal DOM by specific bacterial
strains which allows less specific strains to use these secondary compounds for their growth. All
strains belonging to Flavobacteriia (n = 10) were able to use the DOM provided by C. neogracilis,
and this exudate sustained a growth capacity of up to 100 times higher than diluted MB medium,
of two Pseudomonas sp. strains and one Sulfitobacter strain.

In conclusion, using a simple model of interaction (one microalgal exudate/one bacterial
strain) to avoid complex biotic interactions which occur in microbial communities, we were able
to confirm that dissolved exudates from different microalgae differed in their bioavailability to
bacterial strains. Our results reinforce the fact that DOM can shape the bacterial community
composition by selecting the most responsive species having the right genetic material to degrade
the DOM at their disposal in their specific environment.

Data accessibility. All DNA sequences were deposited in GenBank (NCBI) with accession nos. MK 224724-224815
for bacterial strains isolated during this study and MK 217878-217881 for four bacterial strains isolated in the
Beaufort Sea. Additional data are available within the electronic supplementary material.
