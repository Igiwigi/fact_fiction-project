with Step 4 provides the energy balance (E) in definition 2.1 for energetic solutions, and the proof
of theorem 3.1 is finished, except for the construction of the MRS.

The remaining part in the above proof is the difficult Step 3, where the stability of the
accumulation point q : [0, T] > Q is established. In [8, §5], this step was done under the restrictive
assumption of convexity of E(t,-). Here, we show that the proof via the construction of
MRS is more flexible. Of course, we still need a fine tool from weak convergence theory,
namely H-measure or microlocal defect measures; see [40-42] for the more general microlocal
compactness forms.

(c) Pseudo-differential operators and H-measures

To understand the set of stable states a little better, we can use the facts that E(t,-) is quadratic,
that E(t, -,@) is uniformly convex (by Korn’s inequality and J, da > 0), and that D depends on 6
only. Thus,

q=(u,0) € S(t) => uminimizes E(t,-,0) > U=Uelast + BO,

where the minimizer Uelast(t) of E(t,-,0) satisfies Uelast(-) € gpir + C!([0, T]; U). The linear
operator satisfies Be Lin(L7(@); U). Defining J(t,0) := E(t, Uelast(t) + BO,0), we arrive at the


quadratic functional

I(t, 0) = 5 (LO, 0) + (BE), 0) + a(t) = min { E(t, u,6)| ue UY,
