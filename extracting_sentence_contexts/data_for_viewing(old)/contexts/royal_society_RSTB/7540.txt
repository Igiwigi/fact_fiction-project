west gale (force 7 to 8) blowing almost straight down the lake. All the surface water above
14° C had been dragged to the leeward half of the lake, and the thermocline at this end
was very sharp (4°/m at S). At the windward end conditions were very different. Most of
the metalimnion (here defined as the transitional layer between the steepest temperature
gradient, the thermocline, and that lower part of the hypolimnion which is nearly
isothermal) had been shifted to the windward half. The isotherms were curved upward and

cut the surface at widely spaced intervals from 14° at a mid-lake position to 7° at the
windward end. Table 1 gives further proof that the water, at that time lying at the surface
at the windward end, was in fact hypolimnion water which had welled up to replace the
original epilimnion totally removed by the wind. While it is not the purpose of this paper to
discuss this phenomenon in detail, it may be pointed out that when bottom and intermediate
water has been forced to the surface it will become incorporated in the rapid surface drift,
if the wind continues long enough, and so mix into the epilimnion, which will consequently

Ficure 8. Distribution of temperature in a longitudinal section of Windermere northern basin on
9 June 1947, (a) during the morning (10.30 to 12.10 h) at the height of a north-westerly gale of
force 7 to 8, and (b) during the afternoon (15.25 to 17.14) as the gale was moderating. Letters
indicate measuring stations. The vertical scale is 100 x the horizontal. The black silhouette at
the base of (5) represents the section in true proportions. The crosses in (4) indicate cosine series
