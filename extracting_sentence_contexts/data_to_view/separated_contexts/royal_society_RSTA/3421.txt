SThus the leaks given above are about one thousand times smaller than those given
by RicHarpson at the same temperatures. 8 These facts naturally suggest the question whether more thorough cleaning of the
wire and purification of the air would not still further diminish the negative leak. To test this a wire was mounted as before and boiled in HNO, for about an hour. It
was then left in the HNO, for 24 hours and a current passed from the wire to the
cylinder through the HNO,, so that the NO, ions were set free on the wire.
