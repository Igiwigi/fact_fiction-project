This circumstance would appear to indicate that
the diminution of the terminal arc, on exposure to the sun, was caused by the
heat which it imparted ; but subsequent obseryations clearly showed that this
was not the case, and that the effect was only s0 far dependent on the heat of
the sun, that this appeared in some instances to measure the intensity of the
action which produced the diminution. These observations in July, compared
with those in April, appear to indicate that the effect of the sun's rays on the
magnetized needle in April was greater than in July; although their intensity,
measured by the heat imparted, was much less in the former case than in the
latter. If, however, such is really the case, nothing but observations carefully
made and repeated during a series of years, would satisfactorily establish such
a fact, It may appear that IT have unnecessarily multiplied observations all
pointing to the same conclusions : my object in making them was, in the first
instance, to satisfy myself that the effects which I observed invariably took
place under certain cireumstances; and I, in all cases, give these repeated ob-
servations, that others may be enabled to draw their own coneJusions from
them, should they doubt the correctness of mine. In order to determine how far the vibrations of a needle are influenced by
the separate rays, I placed a glass cylinder, ground plane on the under edge,
upon the plate of glass covering the compass-box ; and I proposed, by having
fluids of different colours in this cylinder, to transmit only particular rays to
the needle. Owing, however, to the irregularities on the sides of the cylinder,
s0 much light was lost in transmission through the cylinder even when empty,
that the effect was considerably diminished ; and after a few trials I gave up
