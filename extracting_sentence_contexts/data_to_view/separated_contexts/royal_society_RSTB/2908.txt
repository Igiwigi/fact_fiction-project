This hypothesis necessitates the admission
that in the gradual increase of the vertical extent of the gill lamella the abaxial end
of the thickened rim is as relatively fixed as the axial end, and that the extreme
ventral point of the filament at the lower edge of the demibranch of the ordinary
Lamellibranch gill represents a point halfway along the thickened rim of the leaflet,
as shown in fig. 4 (p. 176). That this is an untenable view is rendered more than probable by the fact that all

ascending filaments afterwards, and the interlamellar junctions at a still later date.

homologous, not alone to the descending limb of a filament, as Mirsuxurt has done,
but to both descending and ascending limbs.”
