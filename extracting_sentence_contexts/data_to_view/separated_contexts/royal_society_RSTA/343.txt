English Channel and Irish Sea (stations 1 to 3 and 46 to 51) The observations in the English Channel (nos. 1, 2 and 3) are too few to enable any
detailed conclusion to be reached, but the negative anomalies in this area fit in with the
known facts concerning the geology of the region. The positions of the stations and the free-
air, Bouguer and isostatic anomalies are given in table 8 and are plotted on charts 2, 3 and 4. As the topography is slight, these do not differ greatly from one another.
