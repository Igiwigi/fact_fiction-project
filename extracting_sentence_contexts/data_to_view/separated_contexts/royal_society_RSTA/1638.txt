is therefore true,
and is applicable to viscous liquids. The conclusion deduced from his theory that an inviscid liquid would_be unstable
if the cylinders rotated in opposite directions is not applicable to viscous fluids. In
fact it is a remarkable feature of the curves that if the outer cylinder is rotating in the
opposite direction to the inner one, the speed which it is necessary for the inner cylinder
to attain in order that instability may arise is greater than it would be if the outer

cylinder were at rest. Spiral Form of Instability. In many cases a spiral form of instability was observed.
