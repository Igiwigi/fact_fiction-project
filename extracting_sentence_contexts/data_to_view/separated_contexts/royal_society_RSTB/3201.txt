ZIMMERMANN supports NXget1’s conclusion that the high resistance in a JAMIN’S
chain is due to the viscosity of the surface tension membrane being higher than in
the interior of the liquid, and is not due to any interaction between the wall and
membrane. ‘This is a curiously contradictory statement, since an increase of
viscosity can raise the resistance to flow only by frictional interaction with the walls. The fact that Jamuy’s chains, formed with air and such liquids as alcohol or ether,
which keep the- walls permanently wetted, do not develop any, high resistance on
standing, is sufficient to show the true source of this phenomenon. Owing to the
ready permeability of the walls of the wood-vessels to. water, complete adhesion of
the menisci never takes place in living functioning wood-vessels containing water
and air-bubbles, and even in vessels filled with air a film of water -lines the
interior.
