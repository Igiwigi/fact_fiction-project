Also, all VAR-based GC methods rely on a priori selection of the model lag length (i.e.
the amount of past information to include in the model for the present observation), which, in
most VAR applications, coincides with model order selection or, more specifically, the choice
of AR order. While this choice can have a significant impact on the estimation of GC, and a
number of criteria exist for this choice [86] (also see [27] for an extensive discussion), no general
consensus exists on how to estimate AR orders in causality studies. In this context it should
be noted that, while the development of algorithms for VAR parameter estimation has coaxed
most published studies towards employing identical orders for the caused and for the causing
variable, there is no theoretical reason for this choice, which may in fact contradict the basic
concept underlying the idea of GC (i.e. that, given the restricted model, one should find the best
possible unrestricted model based on some figure of merit). In this study, we, therefore, moved
away from this common practice by performing independent, sequential order selection for the
caused, causing and conditioning variables.


6. Limitations and conclusion

Recent evidence points towards the viability of GC analysis in fMRI, provided the data are
acquired under a high SNR and high temporal-resolution regime.
