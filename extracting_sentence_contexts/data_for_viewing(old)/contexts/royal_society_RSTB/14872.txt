tRNA variants can cause mistranslation of a kind or a level
that cells are able to tolerate under normal conditions.

(b) Amino acid similarity may alleviate mistranslation

toxicity in cells

Here we compared a tRNA** variant that mistranslates Phe
codons, as well as a series of tRNA variants that mis-read
Gly codons with Ala. In terms of their chemical similarity
in solution or in the context of a folded protein, Gly and
Ala are much more similar amino acids than Phe and Ser.
In agreement with this fact, we observed significant cytotox-
icity only in cells expressing the Phe-decoding tRNAS™
variant, while the tRNA“ and tRNAS mutants lead to
no changes in cytotoxicity despite showing strong evidence
of amino acid mis-incorporation.

Several examples in the literature support the idea that the
similarity between an intended and mis-incorporated amino
acid is an important factor that will impact the degree and
severity of the cellular response to mistranslation or resulting
phenotypic defects in mistranslating cells. In studies in yeast,
tRNA** variants were assayed for the ability to mis-read Arg
codons and tRNA"® variants that mis-read Pro codons with
