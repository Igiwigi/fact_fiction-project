The figures for flint in the Lower Wolston clay are a little misleading—in fact, the lower
part is normally devoid of flint, and it was the upper half only which yielded this material
and then only in abundance at Wolston; but numerically the sample here was rather large,
with a consequent effect on the average obtained from all the holes.

The general trend is clear—the Wolston clay commences with little but Bunter pebbles
and Keuper sandstone as erratics, and ends with these much reduced and flint equal in
importance to the Bunter material. The Dunsmore gravel continues the trend, with
Keuper sandstone reduced to vanishing point, Bunter pebbles down to half their original
importance, and flint now dominant. These figures show how a northern ice (it can hardly
be called western’), rich in Bunter and Keuper detritus, was gradually pushed aside by
an eastern ice with flint as the main transported material.
