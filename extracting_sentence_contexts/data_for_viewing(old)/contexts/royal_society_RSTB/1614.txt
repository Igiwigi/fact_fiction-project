of the Scaphia which close them, and therefore, whatever may be the mode of motion

or vibration of the former, the intensity of the final effect upon the latter must be
| inereased jn direct proportion to the difference hetween thei respective superficial
 gpeas. Nevertheless, it is doubtful if any physiological significance can be attached
to this resemblance which, after all, is merely superficial, and, as we have already
augeested, is apparently conditioned by the necessarily large relative size of the air-
Halder. On the other hand, the leverage of the Weberian ossicles in the Siluride
S iy very different from that of the Mammalian auditory ossicles. The approximate
5 equality iu the length of the two arms of the leyer in the former ease is sufficient to
& prove that no increased effect is gained in the transmission of any form of motion
©, from the walls of the air-bladder to the anditory organ. In fact, so far from there
2 wing any specivl adaptations in the Weberian mechanism for this purpose, which
would certainly seem to be necessary in the case of sound transmission, the facts of
= structure point quite in the opposite direction. The nature of the ligamentous
6 conection between the different ossicles, and the fact that the moyements of the
& Seaphia mush take place in a plane at right angles to the posterior entrance of the
2 ayo sinus impuris,* and the division of the neck of the sinus endolymphaticus into
6 the vizht and left halves of the ductus endolymphations at right angles to the former,
& seem better adapted to diminish rather than intensify the effect produced on the
8 aulilory organ by slight vibrations or other movements of the walls of the air-

bladder.
