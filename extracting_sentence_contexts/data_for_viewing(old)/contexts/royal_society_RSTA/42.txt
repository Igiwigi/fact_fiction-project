Nash equilibria in the derivation of a kinetic wealth distribution model, thus linking these two
topics in a quite novel way.

5. Non-standard free boundary problems

In classical literature, socio-economic, free boundary problems mainly appear in the context of : >
optimal stopping of diffusions, i.e. as obstacle problems for parabolic PDEs. In their seminal |
paper, Lasry & Lions [35] on mean-field games also presented a parabolic free boundary problem : S
modelling the evolution of the price in an economic market with a large number of agents, where : 3
a single good is traded. This one-dimensional free boundary problem is—strictly speaking—not [&

a mean field game, but it exhibits very remarkable mathematical features which make it difficult
to treat by standard free boundary techniques. In fact, the Lasry—Lions price formation model
has attracted a lot of attention so far: preliminary analytical results were given in [57-59] and
a rather complete existence, uniqueness, regularity and long-time asymptotic analysis based on
a geometric method can be found in [60,61]. A derivation from a mesoscopic Boltzmann-type
system using a scaling limit technique (high trading frequency) can be found in [62] and a
hyperbolic-type scaling limit in [63]. Extensions incorporating stochastically fluctuating markets
are in progress [64]; however, we remark that significant further steps have to be taken in terms of
modelling (e.g. incorporating utility functions) before applications to realistic economic markets
can be tackled.

In this issue, Berestycki et al. [65] consider a topic which has a huge importance in the world
of finance: the appearance and time evolution of financial bubbles, which are a major scare for
and even a threat to the world economy. The authors devise a highly nonlinear and non-local free
