It has an otic process reaching up in close contact and in some regions in sutural
connection with the inner end of the quadrate ramus of the pterygoid to the pro-otic.
The inner part of the dorsal end of the otic process reaches up to the skull roof,
or very nearly so ; laterally it is depressed to form with the pro-otic and pterygoid
the lower border of the foramen of the vena capitis dorsalis.

Viewed from the outer aspect, the otic process gives origin to the main mass
of the bone, which runs forwards and inwards and upwards as a processus ascendens,
separated by a deep narrow notch, widening into a foramen, from the otic process.

On the endocranial surface the ascending process forms a large area lying outside
the original cranial wall (whose position is indicated by the posterior end of the
sphenethmoid), The bone articulates with, may in fact be fused to, the antero-
lateral corner of the basisphenoid. Just above the dorsal surface of this bone
the inner surface of the epipterygoid is crossed by a very deep and narrow groove,
whose outer end opens by a notch at the front border of the bone. Posteriorly,
this groove is overhung by a delicate process which joins or nearly joins the anterior
and lower corner of the pro-otic. Lateral to and behind this process the groove
turns outwards and upwards, leading to the deep groove and foramen which separate
the otic and ascending processes. Into the groove at this point opens the large
foramen for the vena capitis lateralis. The groove is undoubtedly for the Gasserian
ganglion, the first part of the fifth nerve passing out from the notch in front of the
bone, and the second and third branches between the otic and ascending processes.
All appearances suggest that the main trunk of the vena capitis lateralis passes
through the foramen and receives a vena cerebralis media coming out of the cranial
