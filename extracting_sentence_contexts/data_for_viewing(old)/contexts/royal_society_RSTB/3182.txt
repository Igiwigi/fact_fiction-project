the other forming only a thin layer at the periphery of the egg, and which I will
distinguish, for convenience of description, as the ‘ peripheral spherules.”

(a) The Yolk Spherules: their Appearance with Varying Fixation —The yolk
spherules proper average from 1-—1°5 » in diameter, and are always quite spherical
in form, After fixation with sublimate or sublimate acetic, they remain unstained
by the heematoxylin, and appear pale yellow in colour and refringent (fig. 65).
After fixation with acetic bichromate, on the other hand, the yolk spherules are
deeply basophile, prolonged extraction only serving to de-stain their extreme
peripheral portions. After fixation with Hermany’s fluid, the spherules remain
unstained, are non-refringent, and vary in colour from a pale yellow to a dark brown
or even black. This coloration is due to the osmic acid in the fixing reagent,* and
is entirely independent of staining or extraction, a fact which, together with their
varying and irregular distribution, serves to sharply distinguish them from the
peripheral spherules immediately to be described.

(b) Zhe Peripheral Spherules.—These spherules, as already noted, form a thin
layer immediately to the inside of the vitelline membrane. The surface of the adult
egg, and with it the inner surface of the egg membrane, is, in fixed material, almost
invariably thrown into fine wrinkles (fig. 65), the peripheral granules being collected
into the ridges so produced. In the younger eggs this surface wrinkling is absent,
and here the peripheral spherules form an even layer (fig. 63).

The peripheral spherules of the adult egg differ from those of the rest of the yolk
both in their size and in their staining reactions. Their size, though averaging that
