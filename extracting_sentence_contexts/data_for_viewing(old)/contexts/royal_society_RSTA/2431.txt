wind anomaly, surface pressure anomaly, thermal damping coefficients, etc. The GZT model is
deceivingly simple in that it features only delayed feedback and periodic forcing. Yet, it was
shown in [19,23] to be capable of dynamics that could replicate certain ENSO features, such as
variability on appropriate time scales and phase locking with the seasons. These are features that
have been observed earlier in more complex ENSO models [24-26]. The balance between the
complicated dynamics produced by DDE models and their (relative) simplicity, allowing them
to still be mathematically tractable, explains their success in areas as diverse as, for example,
laser dynamics [27], neural networks [28], traffic flow [29], cell population dynamics [30] and
epidemiology [31].

DDEs are infinite-dimensional dynamical systems and their analysis generally poses analytical
and numerical challenges. Nonetheless, the theory of DDEs with a finite number of constant
delays is well developed [32,33]. In fact, the bifurcation theory of constant-delay DDEs is analogue
to that of ordinary differential equations: their solutions depend smoothly on parameters and
initial conditions, and their linearizations around equilibria and periodic solutions have at
most finitely many unstable eigendirections. Furthermore, advanced numerical tools for their
simulation and bifurcation analysis are available and have been applied successfully to analyse
models arising in various applications, for example, see [34] and references therein.

In [20,35], we conducted a bifurcation analysis of the GZT model (1.1) in order to understand
how it is able to produce such rich dynamics. This was done by means of the MATLAB-
based continuation software DDE-Biftool [36,37], which allows the user to track (or continue)
steady-state and periodic solutions of DDEs while varying a chosen model parameter. It can
calculate the stability of such solutions, allowing one to detect bifurcations. It is then possible
to continue detected bifurcations of steady-state and periodic solutions in two-parameter planes.
