It is evident that these differences shall be attributed
to dissimilar stiffness and mass distributions along the two support structures (table 2) and,
also, to the activation of the second FA and SS support structure modes, whose frequencies are
substantially different in the Tripod and Jacket (table 1). A final important comment is that, as shown in figures 7 and 8, stress resultant and tower top
acceleration demands generally increase with the PGA, thus meaning that the PGA can be taken
as an acceptable indicator of demand for the structures under study. Because the PGA is typically
related to the short-period energy content of the earthquake, this result reflects the fact that the
rotor modes and second support structure modes (table 1) play an important role in the seismic
response, as shown in figure 4a (periods of the rotor modes and second support structure modes
fall in the region of maxima spectral accelerations) and figures 5 and 6 (activation of the second
support structure modes), in agreement with similar findings for land-based HAWTs [8-10].

(a) Stress resultant and tower top acceleration demands for flexible foundation model

In figures 7 and 8, stress resultant and tower top acceleration demands for flexible FM are denoted
by symbol ‘A’, while grey vertical lines indicate the corresponding demands due to wind and
wave loads only, for the environmental states in load cases LC1-LC2-LC3 (see §3). At the tower base and pile head, in both Tripod and Jacket, stress resultant demands do not
change significantly with respect to the corresponding demands for fixed FM, in all load cases
LC1-LC2-LC3. This result may be explained considering that the frequencies of the first FA
and SS support structure modes, as well as the frequencies of the blades modes, hold almost
the same values for fixed and flexible FMs (table 1), while the frequencies of second FA and
SS support structure modes, although being reduced by the foundation flexibility (table 1), still
correspond to periods falling within the range of high-spectral accelerations, as shown in figure 4a
(for instance, for the second FA support structure modes: Tz = 1/1.277 = 0.783 s in the Tripod, and
Tz = 1/0.984 = 1.016 s in the Jacket).
