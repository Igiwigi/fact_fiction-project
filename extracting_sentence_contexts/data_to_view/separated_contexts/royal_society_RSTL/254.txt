These experiments show; that when
two parallel planks, (Plate XI., fig. 1,) have loose pieces in-
terposed, extending perpendicularly from one to the other,

they are incomparably weaker, with respect to any transverse
force, than when the intermediate pieces are in an oblique
direction, s0 as to constitute a frame, which can only be bent
as a whole. But it cannot for a moment be imagined, that
the planks of a ship are connected with the timbers in as loose
a manner as these transverse braces, which will scarcely sup-
port their own weight for the purpose of the experiment; and in
fact the comparison would have required, that the whole space
included by the parallelogram should be filled up in eachcase
by similar braces, or at least that the two planks should have
been firmly united at the Joose end to the transverse- braces
(fig. g); and it is demonstrable that in this case the same
weight would have broken the pins, as if one of the planks
had been oblique, or as if the planks had remained parallel,
and had been connected by oblique pieces. Such a result would, however, be far from proving the in-
utility of the addition of oblique braces to a rectangular frame:
for the kind of strength, required for any particular purpose,
is not always determined by the magnitude of the force which
would be capable of breaking the substances concerned, al-
though the power of resisting such a force is properly called
strength, in the most limited sense of the term : but there are
many occasions on which stiffness or inflexibility is: of still
greater consequence than $trength, and others again on which
Hexibility is of material advantage. A coach spring, consist=
ing of ten equal plates, would be rendered ten times as strong,
if it were united into one mass, and at the same time a hun-
dred times as stiff, bending only one hundredth of an inch
with the same weight that would bend it a whole inch in its
usual state, although nothing would be gained by the union

with respect to the power of resisting a very rapid motion,
which I have, on another occasion, ventured to call resilience.
