We have thus the four conditions, continuity of
tangential displacement and of tangential stress; and the one sufficient condition
which will secure that they also make the normal stress continuous, 7.e. that th
medium is a possible one, is that there shall be no loss of energy in the operation of
reflexion and refraction, The four conditions here specified are mathematically
equivalent to those of Fresnet’s theory of reflexion ; and the satisfaction of the fifi
condition carries with it the justification of that theory for the type of medium whieh
it implies. For the case worked out by FREsNEL, that of isotropic media, the
constitution of his medium is thus limited to be precisely that of the labile sether
of Lord Kevin ; in order to satisfy also the fifth condition, that of continuity of
energy, we are constrained to take the displacement perpendicular to the plane of
polarization, which gives a reason independent of experiment for Fresnut’s choice.

24, Let us next consider the second form of hypothesis, that of incompressibility,
At the interface all three components of the displacement must now be continuous;
and to obtain a solution, there is needed only one other condition, which may be taken
to be the preservation of the energy of the motion. Here, as NEUMANN remarks, there
is absolutely nothing assumed about the elastic condition of the media, which may
fact remain wholly unknown except as to their assumed incompressibility and as to the
law of density, and the problem of reflexion will nevertheless be completely solve
But if we go further than this, and attempt to speculate about the elasticity of th
optical medium, it must be limited to be of such nature as also to satisfy two other cor
ditions which are involved in the continuity of the tangential stress at the interface. Thus on the principles that the energy is propagated along the rays, that it is a



'

any instant half potential and half kinetic, and that there is no loss of energy of the
light in the act of reflexion, and on the hypothesis that the medium is incompressible,
the solution of the problem of reflexion as distinct from that of the elastic constitution
of the medium is immediately derived, for all media which polarize the light linearly,
without the aid of further knowledge except the law of density and the form of the
wave-surface. If the density is uniform and the same in all media, the solution is
that of MacCuntacH and Neumann, which is known to be correct in form for
isotropic (and also for crystalline) media.
