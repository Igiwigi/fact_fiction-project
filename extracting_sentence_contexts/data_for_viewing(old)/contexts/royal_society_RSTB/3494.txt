structure of the tissue has been already described, and” its physiological nature must
now be considered.

The form of the epidermal cells and the palisade tissue are shown. The cells of the latter often
show swollen ends (b) which abut on the melasmatic tissue. The structure of the bundle is also
seen.

Some authors have suggested that its cell contents were derived from products of
secretion,* but Hick thought it was comparable with the starch layer in the leaves
of modern plants, on the grounds of its close association with the palisade tissue and
vascular bundle. The present work strongly confirms the latter view. A consider-
able amount of the tissue is present in all the specimens, and this fact alone indicates
that it had some vital importance. On one side the cells abut on the conducting
parenchyma of the vascular bundle, while on the other they are in contact with the

through them. In some cases the ends of the palisade cells were enlarged at the
