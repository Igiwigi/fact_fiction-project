After maximum pressure, i.e., in effect after the propellant has been completely converted into gas, the
gas density remains constant, and convection ceases. A modified set of circumstances consequently arises,
since there is then heat conduction through the gas complex, now at constant density, together with heat
conduction through the steel, as previously considered. In these conditions, as is well known, resistance
to flow of heat from the gas hody to the wall surface is very much influenced by the thermal state of the
layer of gas contiguous to the surface, and allowance has to be made for this fact in any general treatment. From inspection of cooling curves, i.e., pressure-time curves obtained after maximum pressure, it can be
ascertained that heat losses by cooling take place comparatively slowly, the modifying influence of the
intervening gas layer being clearly at work. A phenomenon of this nature is likely to come more and
more into prominence as abstraction of energy by the walls in the form of work, together with convection
effects, cease, as the densities of loading are diminished, and as the propellant sizes are increased, times
being more and more prolonged.
