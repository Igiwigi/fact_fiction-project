MILNE ON RADIATIVE EQUILIBRIUM. 233

Second Approximation.*—To obtain a more accurate solution we use cosine approxi-
mations for I and I’ in determining J, instead of mean values. Assume for this purpose

= a+2b cos 0, ’ = a—2b cos w. We then find (omitting the details),
b = 2F, Sie Hh (D-Eee) ee | Gel ence: . > (27')
using as the boundary condition the fact that the ¢otal incident radiation is zero. Hence

I (c, 6) = $F (1+ $04 $ cos 6)+e7 (%~” * [T, —3F (1+30,4+ $008 6)],. . (28’)

The advantage of the present approximation is that (28’) will now be found to give the
correct net flux, 7F, at the outer boundary,

and hence, up to and including the first power of o, (30’) approximates to

exactly as for the first approximation. Similarly (33) holds for the total emergent
radiation.
