Because of the fact that the issue on the
droplet evaporation time is crucial to establish whether viruses lingering on dry nuclei upon
droplet evaporation retain their full potential of infection [5], turbulence in a puff needs to be
fully understood and characterized in a statistical sense. As a matter of fact, a consistent statistical theory is currently not available for puff turbulence. The reason is probably due to the fact that the system at hand does not possess all desirable
symmetries characterizing the classical ideal turbulence setting. Current knowledge of puff
turbulence is confined to the pioneering work by Kovasznay et al. [7] only dealing with bulk
quantities involved in the puff dynamics: the puff bulk translational velocity and the average
puff radius. A first attempt to characterize from a statistical point of view the small-scale structure of
turbulent fluctuations of both velocity and temperature, but neglecting the two-phase nature of
the problem, is reported in [8] where an adiabatic generalization of the Kolmogorov-Obukhov
picture of steady Navier-Stokes turbulence [9,10] has been presented in two relevant cases: one
in which the buoyancy of the puff is negligible and the opposite situation where buoyancy
dominates the puff dynamics.
