is composed of two parts; the inner part nearer the middle line is formed by the
calcarine fibres (fig. 43, right, C:f), whilst the outer part, which bounds inferiorly the
cornu Ammonis, shows fibres cut across and is the cingulum (fig. 48, right, Cing., p-).

It will now be advisable to explain more minutely the relation of the calcarine
fibres to those of the cingulum, At first it might appear as if the cingulum extended
from the inner lip of the calearine fissure round to the outer lip and so up the isthmus
of the gyrus fornicatus, but on examining sagittal sections (figs. 10 and 11), and
horizontal sections (figs. 35, 36) it is seen that the cingulum never becomes inferior
or posterior to the calcarine fissure. Further, it will be remembered that the sections
(figs. 41-45) which we are now examining, are not frontal but fronto-oblique. Con-
sequently, a section made at this level would pass inferiorly through the occipital
lobe-—this is shown by the fact that we have now reached the point where the
ealcarine fissure appears in sagittal sections to pass backwards from the dentate
sulcus——and would therefore cut through the cingulum somewhere in the upper part
of the gyrus hippocampi, or in the isthmus of the gyrus fornicatus (fig. 10, near S./.).
We have here, therefore, the calcarine fissure becoming more marked as we proceed
backwards, whilst the dentate sulcus diminishes and finally disappears. Passing there-
fore round the bottom of the calcarine fissure there is this U-shaped set of fibres, viz.,
the calearine (fig. 41-45, C,f).

At the bottom of the U, and extending upwards along its outer limb, the cingulum
is seen (fig. 43, right, Cing., p.) as a conical collection of fibres projecting upwards
into the gyrus hippocampi and helping to form the outer limb of the U-shaped
calearine fibres. It is particularly to be noticed that the cingulum is represented by
