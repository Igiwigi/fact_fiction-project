the first row contains a combined number of two’s and units = the combined
numbers in the second row, and further, the number of two's in first row, = the
number of two’s in second row. In the © function these conditions are secured by
the auxiliaries a, b, respectively, and it is established that the problem of partition at
the points of the elementary (7.¢., simple square) lattice is identical with that of two
superposable unit-graphs, each of at most two rows.
In fact, the graph

the axis of z being perpendicular to the plane of the paper, is immediately convertible
to the lattice form by projection, with summation of units, upon the plane yz. The
numbers at the points of the square lattice would be 6, 4, 4, 2 respectively.
