of emotions, like the insula and the anterior cingulate, respond both when one
feels an emotion (e.g. pain or disgust) owing to natural stimuli, or when one
observes that emotion in others [7-10]. This mechanism allows a direct
first-person understanding of others’ emotion. ‘Your pain is my pain’.

Some authors previously questioned the presence of mirror neurons in
humans [11]. This is not, however, a current issue, given the overwhelming evi-
dence for the existence of mirror neurons in humans from hundreds of
experiments [12] carried out with a variety of techniques (positron emission
tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial magnetic
stimulation, magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography), as well as
from a few single neuron studies [13]. It is, nevertheless, of some interest to exam-
ine the reasons why this somehow surprising debate took place. In fact,
traditionally, the mechanisms discovered in primates as well as in other species
