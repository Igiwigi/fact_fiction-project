So (2n + 1) of the real constants are determined in terms of the
other (2n + 1) by the condition that the group is to conserve a fundamental circle ;
but as the fundamental circle muy be any whatever, and so involves three constants,
we must deduct three from the number of equations, giving (2n — 2). Thus, 2n — 2
real, or m — 1 complex, constants can be determined from the condition that the
substitutions of ¢ conserve a fundamental circle. Thas accords with the fact, otherwise
arrived at, that the constants hy, ko,... k,-, in the differential equation have to be
determined from this consideration. Among the quasi-uniformising variables of any algebraic form there are several
distinct uniformising variables.
