were it to be filled in on the same scale of
magnification as the enlarged segment photographed, the actual diameter of the pith
being 1455 x 7 em. Fig. 2, Plate 23, illustrates very well the radial view of the wood
cylinder, and shows the slight increase in the amount of the wood lower down in the
trunk, and also the sprayed out branching of the strands passing into the leaf-bases,

Partly owing to the surface weathering, and partly to the fact that the young,
undeveloped cones are deeply embedded in the leaf-bases, the fructifications cannot,
unequivocably, be recognised in the external surface of the specimen. The dark, hard texture of the petrifying medium in which the tissues are well
preserved appears, so far as can be judged without analyses, to be preponderatingly
composed of silicates with a small admixture of carbonates. Deraitep Description OF VEGETATIVE ORGANS.
