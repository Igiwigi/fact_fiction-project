Tr has long been known that iron which has been overstrained in tension—that is to
say strained beyond the yield-point so that it suffers a permanent stretch—possesses
very different elastic properties from the same iron in its primitive condition. The
material is said to be “hardened” by stretching,* since the ultimate effect of such
treatment is to raise the elastic limit and reduce the ductility of the material. More recently, attention has been called to the fact that, primarily, the result of
tensile overstrain is to make iron assume a semi-plastic state, so that the elastic limit,
instead of being raised by stretching, is first of all lowered, it may be to zero.t This
plasticity may be shown by applying a comparatively small load to a bar of iron or
steel which has just been overstrained by the application and removal of a large
stretching load. When the small load is put on, the bar will be found to elongate
further than it would had the material been in its primitive state; and a slight
continued elongation—a “creeping”—may occur after the small load has been
applied. If this load be withdrawn, a quite appreciable permanent, or semi-
permanent, set will be found to have been produced ; a set which diminishes slightly,
