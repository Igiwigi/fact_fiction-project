within an hour, together with its effects on the alveolar CO, pressure. If the
diminished alkalinity of the blood at high altitudes were simply due to lactic acid
formed in excess we should similarly expect this diminished alkalinity to disappear
and appear rapidly, and similarly with the changes in the alveolar CO, pressure. We
have seen, however, that though some lowering of the alveolar CO, pressure may
develop quickly, it takes many days for the full lowering to develop. Moreover, the
lowering progressively increases while the more acute symptoms of oxygen-want are
passing off. It also takes many days for this lowering to pass off on a return to
higher atmospheric pressure, whereas a rapidly produced lowering, as by going for two
or three hours to greatly diminished atmospheric pressure, passes off within an hour
or two.

In view of these facts it does not seem probable that the diminished alkalinity of
the blood at high altitudes is due merely to an excessive production of lactic acid.
