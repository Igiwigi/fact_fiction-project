Two pounds of gold were afterwards alloyed with tin and
copper; the former was in the proportion of eight grains in the
ounce, similar to the last experiment ; and, in like manner, the
alloyed metal was found to be perfectly ductile; so that the bar,
which at first was + of an inch in thickness, was rolled as thin
as a guinea, and, when thus rolled, it still remained so oft, that
it was punched and stamped without being previously annealed. *

* It has been suggested, that tin might be advantageously employed as an alloy for
Myer coin ; but, by some experiments which I purposely made, I found the fact to be
the reverse; for, when silver was alloyed with the standard proportion of tin, it proved

brittle, and did not ring well; and the same defects preyailed, when an alloy com-
poed of equal parts of tin and copper was employed. -

74 Mr. HatcnerT's Experiments on the various Alloys,

It is therefore certain, that tin, in s8mall quantities, or even
in the proportion of eight grains in the ounce Troy, is not by
any means $0 injurious to the ductility of gold as was generally
believed, previous to the publication of Mr. ALcyorne's Paper,
in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1784,. *

Some time after the experiments lately described were made,
RosxrrT BixGLEY, Esq. his Majesty's Assay Master at the Mint,
communicated to me the following experiments, made by him,
in consequence of a paper published in the Memoirs of the
Academy of Sciences at Paris for the year 1790, and in
N1icyoLsoN's Philosophical Journal, Vol. II.
