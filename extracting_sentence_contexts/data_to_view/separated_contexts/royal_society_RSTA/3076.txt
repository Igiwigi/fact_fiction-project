This yields

ca) Ig = ue, HP
fo) = rag, ype OP (- 20x, ) (3.4)

for some density p > 0, absolute temperature @ > 0 and velocity u in R°. Substitution of fo into the five balance laws given by the first five moments of the Boltzmann
equation yields the classical Euler equations displayed in the previous section where viscous
and thermal diffusion coefficient are set to zero. In fact, both Maxwell and Hilbert were able
to compute f;, and then substitution of the truncated expansion fo + €f; into the five balance
laws yields the Navier-Stokes—Fourier system. But as noted earlier, Maxwell realized that the
Navier-Stokes—Fourier system was unable to predict the motion of the Crookes radiometer. Hence, Maxwell did the obvious next step and attempted to compute the next higher order
correction f7.
