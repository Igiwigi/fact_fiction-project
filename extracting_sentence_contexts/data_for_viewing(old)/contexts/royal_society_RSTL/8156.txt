latter those of the outermost extremities of the medullary rays become actually merged.
The exogenous growth of the ligneous zone which I have so long recognized, but which
has been objected to by some botanists, is now more clearly demonstrated than before.
Decided as were my previous convictions on this point, they have received fresh strength,
80 that T am less than ever inclined to abandon them. We have in these plants the
three distinct tissxues of pith, wood, and bark, in addition to the vascular medullary
cylinder, which latter T am still inclined to suspect may typically represent the medullary
sheath of the true Exogens. The specimens described in the memoir demonstrate two
facts bearing upon the question of the growth of these plants :â€”1st, that the formative
layer, whether we designate it cambium or give it s0ome other name, has been 8ubstan-
tially parallel with the exterior of the previously formed vascular tissues ; 2nd, that this
layer has displayed an intermittent activity, periodic resumptions of vigorous growth
alternating with times of rest. The facts detailed in the memoir clearly demonstrate
that the ligneous zone was gradually built up by a succession of such growths. The
pith, primarily small, ultimately attained to considerable dimensions through the fissi-
parous multiplication of its cells. Possibly it may have been the pressure occasioned by
this multiplication that caused the continued expansion of the medullary cylinder.

But before attempting to discuss either the physiological questions suggested by this
inquiry, or the homologous relations of the yarious tissues of the Lepidodendra to those
of the living Lycopods, it will be necessary to call attention to a few features in the
latter objects which require to be considered.

Considerable variations exist in the structure of the living Zycopodia and Selaginelle
but an essential unity peryades the entire group. If we take a matured stem of a
