In the applications to molecular theory in its present state, the integrals which can be
reduced to such J’s include the one-electron overlap and resonance integrals, the two-
electron Coulomb and hybrid (Coulomb-exchange) integrals, and also the ‘penetration’
integrals. These are all dealt with in part II. They comprise, in fact, all but one of the types
of molecular integral which appear in systems involving only two nuclei. The one exception,
the exchange integral, will be considered in a later part, together with the three- and four-
centre integrals.

The immediate object of this first part is the description of the new method for evaluating
the J’s. Because the relevant properties of the ¢’s and Z’s suffice also for the evaluation of the
multi-centre integrals, this part can be regarded as providing the mathematical basis for
a systematic approach to the problem of evaluating all the conventional integrals of molecular
theory.
