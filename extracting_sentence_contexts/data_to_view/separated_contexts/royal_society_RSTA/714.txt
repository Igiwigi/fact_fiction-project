shock were surface waves. Although it is certain that effects of this kind must influence the results, in the case
of most of the shocks it is possible to estimate the position of the epicentre without

* The large amplitude recorded by the Wiechert seismograph in the case of this distant shock is
probably to be associated with the fact that the mean period of the recorded earth movements is
much greater than in the case of the more local shocks, and that the natural period of the seismograph
at this time was 2-0 sec. as compared with 0-6 sec. for the Jaggar shock recorders,

appealing to such considerations in interpreting the amplitude patterns.
