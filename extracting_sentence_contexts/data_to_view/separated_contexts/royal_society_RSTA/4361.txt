We first decide : s
ona given non-zero error probability threshold € that can be accepted and a receiver observation : 3

duration T. Then, we search for the largest codebook such that an ideal receiver, upon observing
y(t) over the interval 0 <t<T, can correctly guess the transmitted message m with probability
no less than 1 — e. Disregarding the facts that this search process may be prohibitively complex
and that the ideal receiver may be unknown, the size of this optimal codebook is denoted by M*
and the corresponding rate by R = (logy M*)/T. This quantity is the maximum achievable rate at
duration T and error probability €, and it exists theoretically for any T > 0 and 0 <« <1, even if
we usually do not know how to compute it. Next, we let T increase, still for a given non-zero €, which means that M* also increases.
