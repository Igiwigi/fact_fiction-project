PROFESSOR A. SCHUSTER ON THE PERIODICITIES OF SUNSPOTS. 79

When we come to periods which are near to that of the solar rotation, periodicities
appear, owing to the fact that some of the spots persist during more than one rotation. This effect will, however, disappear when the period is well above that of the solar

periodicities make their presence felt.
