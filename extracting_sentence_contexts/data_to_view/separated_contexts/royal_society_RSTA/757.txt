This is the common property of the systems of confidence intervals considered. Now it is obvious that whilst it is desirable that the true value of 6, = 6,° should
be covered by the confidence interval } (E) determined by an observed sample point
E, it is not so with any other value of 06, = 0’; # 0,°. In fact, the presence of the
value 0’, # 0,° within an interval 8 (E) containing 0,° is unnecessary and may be

interpreted as an indication that this interval is “ too broad’’. It is clearly impossible
to avoid altogether covering the values of 0, which are not true. But we may try
to diminish the frequency of 3 (E) covering any value 6’, 4 6,° to a minimum.
