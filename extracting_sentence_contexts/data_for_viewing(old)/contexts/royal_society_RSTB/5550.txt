There is no account of their presence in Diptera.

Der Serys Lonecuamps made a careful study of Pleuropodia in the beetle Tenebrio
molitor, 1904. In this form during the course of development, the pleuropodium becomes
closely adherent to the embryonic membrane, the amnion breaks down and occupies
the cavity of the appendage and the serosa loses differentiation. The amnion and
serosa apart from the region of the pleuropodium become fused together and withdraw
to the dorsal side of the embryo. From this he concludes that the organ plays an
important part in releasing the embryo. That is the tentative conclusion at which
I had arrived with regard to the pleuropodium in Pieris. Its maximum development
coincides with the rupture of the embryonic membranes, its extensions can
certainly be traced across the amniotic cavity to the amnion, and it disappears on larval
emergence. All these facts support the conclusion of Dre Setys Lonccuamps. The
evidence is, however, only circumstantial, and certainly in Pieris might equally conform
to the opinions expressed by Korscnevr, 1912, and BuuncK, 1912, that it is an organ
which produces a fluid to enable the embryo the more easily to perform the flexures of
body effected during blastokinesis, for it has already been pointed out that the gland
is in process of development during blastokinesis. BAtLLon, 1920, seems to be the only
other worker who suggests a different function. In his large work on Locustids he sug-
gests in some species they may have a respiratory function. Here again there is no
experimental evidence in support of this assertion.

Any discussion, however brief, on pleuropodia must contain treatment from the
morphological, phylogenetic and physiological points of view. Morphologically they
are undoubted limbsâ€”hollow extensions of the body wall into which passes a portion
