Tue Myocarprocraru (fig. 3).

We have given this name to the instrument we are about to describe, because
it supplies us directly with graphic records of the contractions of the muscular wall of

of the instrument consists in the fact that, by its means, it is possible to obtain simul-
taneous graphic records of the contractions and expansions of the wall of one of the
