On the subject so presented for consideration, I had to judge that Mr. Murpny’s
course of reasoning was not valid for sustaining MAury’s theory of the atmospheric
motions, and I had to judge moreover, that Maury’s theory was itself, in so far as it
dealt with the circulation outside of the trade-wind zones, entirely untenable and
impossible. Mr. Murpuy’s course of reasoning, however, included within it one important
element not limited in its scope to the application made of it in that particular course
of reasoning. It was the supposition that the low barometric pressure of Polar
regions and other high latitudes, already discovered as a fact, through observations of
voyagers and others, was to be regarded as due to the centrifugal force of the air
revolving from west to east throughout the great cap of atmosphere covering the
middle and high latitudes. Having rejected Maury’s theory, and having got the benefit of the valuable
suggestion just referred to in Mr. Murpuy’s paper, I succeeded in framing a new
theory for the circulation in the regions outside of the trade-wind zones. That new
theory I put forward ina paper read by me at the meeting of the British Association,
