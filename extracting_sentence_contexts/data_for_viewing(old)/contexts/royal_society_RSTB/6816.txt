X# inoculated controls (see figs. 33, 34, 35, pl. 22). It is important to select young
plants for a demonstration experiment because the virulent strains when introduced
into older plants usually produce local lesions and only a restricted systemic reaction.
For the same reason it is not advisable to leave an interval of more than 14 days

between the two inoculations. It is not that the plant is less protected, but only that
the contrast between it and the control is less striking.

When the X” strain was isolated in 1935 this was substituted for X°. Notwithstand-
ing the fact that it is symptomless on the host plants used, its powers of protection
against subsequent infection with X strains are not only equal to but perhaps more
consistently perfect than those of X¢.

The degree of protection depends in the main on two factors:

(1) The age of the plants employed. This applies especially to tobacco; with Datura,
successful protection may be readily secured in older plants. The plants, especially
tobaccos, must be in active growth, so that the protective strain becomes disseminated
through the plant before the advent of the virulent one. In the winter months it is
well to assist the plants with artificial light and heat. It is noticeable that even in
September tobacco plants infected with the X° strain may show an imperfect protec-
tion against the severe strains, because of the delayed dispersion of the X¢ virus.
