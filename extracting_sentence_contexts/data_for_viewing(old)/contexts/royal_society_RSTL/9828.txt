of molecular attraction. This conclusion, if correct, would show that Quixoxe's
number is at least ten times too 8mall.

The values derived from the dynamical theory of gases are, however, much smaller.

O. E. Megyes,t on the contrary, thinks that the canse of the discrepancy is to be
found in the fact that the expression © radius of molecular attraction ” (Wirkungssphiire)
is used in the theory of capillarity in a sense different from that in which it is employed
in the theory of gases. He believes that, if we possessed a kinetic theory of liquids,
the magnitude investigated by QUINckE and PLATEAU would be found to be that of
the free path of the molecules in the liquid, or would acquire some similar meaning.

PraTear's experiments consisted in measuring the pressure of the air confined in a
s0ap bubble by means of a water manometer. A decrease in that pressure might be
expected if the thickness of the film became less than twice the radius of molecular
attraction. His conclusion is based on the fact that no regular change was observed in
the case of a bubble which lasted for three days, and thinned to the pale yellow of the
first order of NewrToN's scale.
