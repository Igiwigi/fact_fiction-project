This mechanism of the blood pump I deduce entirely from anatomy. I have never
observed a contraction, and I doubt whether the mechanism could be tested experimentally.
Such experiments, however, were they possible, I should consider redundant. There is no
more doubt about the method of action of this muscular system than there is about the
action of any muscle attached to the bones of a vertebrate which may happen to be
revealed in a dissection. I am emphasizing this point as the whole of my subsequent
argument depends upon the acceptance of this interpretation of structure.

The free fluid in the pump consists of the blood in the median blood space and also the
blood in the lateral vessels which run through the lateral margins of the pump. The latter
I shall consider later (p. 120). The former has two possible channels for exit: down through
the rostral valve into the long peduncular vessel, or, more posteriorly, into the dorsal
prosomal space. That it does in fact take the former route is shown by the existence of the
valve itself. Since the days when Harvey first demonstrated the function of valves in blood
vessels, anatomists have taken the existence of a valve in a blood vessel as proof that blood
moves through the valve in one direction, that direction being determined by the arrange-
ment of the flap or flaps of the valve. The paired flaps of the rostral valve of Lithotrya are
so arranged that the blood can pass between them down into the peduncle, but not in the
reverse direction. I therefore take it from this fact alone that the blood, squeezed out of
the blood pump, does pass down the peduncle.

However, from the anatomy I have described, it is clear that there is no structural
hindrance to the blood passing out of the blood pump into the prosoma (figures 4 and 12,
and see also later, p. 121). There is no valve such as described by Nussbaum (1890, p. 44).
I must therefore demonstrate the existence of some means by which this passage of blood
