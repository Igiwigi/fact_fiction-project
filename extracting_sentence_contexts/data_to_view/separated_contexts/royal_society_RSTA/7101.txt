First, we can
cal form of solution with subsequent numerical evaluation, or

apply it to our mathemati
directly to our final numerical values for py using numerical

secondly, we can apply it
integration of equation (125). The first method reduces to the application of equation (125) to the first term G,in equation

â€˜g8) to obtain a new G, from which the subsequent terms are obtained by equation (86)
as before. Physically, this corresponds to the fact that the incident field enters directly only
into the production of the first diffraction wave from each edge and we can therefore
consider any shape of pulse by using the appropriate solution of the half-plane problem to
replace equation (85). This first method has advantages if the shape of incident pulse is
such that the new G, can be expressed simply in terms of known tabulated functions. On
the other hand, if the new G, has to be evaluated by numerical integration it would appear
easier to use the second method of direct numerical integration of equation (125).
