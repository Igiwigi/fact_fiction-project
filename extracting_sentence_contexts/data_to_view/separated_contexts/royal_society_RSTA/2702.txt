The concept of explicit symmetry breaking has also been applied in experiments on generation
of tunable broadband radiation from a superconducting ring where a pulse of laser light
breaks the symmetry of cooper pairs, resulting in electromagnetic radiation [38]. Under explicit
symmetry breaking, the momentum current associated with the test charge loses its conserved
value within a localized region of space and time as the corresponding Noether current is the
driver of electromagnetic radiation. An important goal of the current article is to underscore the fact that localized symmetry
breaking is expressed within the framework of Maxwellâ€™s equation on radiation, and it denotes a
close relationship between dependence of the force fields along temporal and spatial dimensions. The rotation of the electric field expressed by curl of the vector E indicates that the symmetry
of the electric field along a set of dimensions in the physical space has been broken. Thus,
