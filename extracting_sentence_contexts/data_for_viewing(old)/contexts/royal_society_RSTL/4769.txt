Seathwaite is about fourteen miles inland. The Flosh is three miles south-east of
Whitehaven, and the same distance from the sea in the direction of the mountains.
Cockermouth is about six miles from the nearest part of the coast, and eight miles
nearer to the sea than Seathwaite. Now places situated on the west coast of England
are generally warmer than more inland localities ; and, were the whole country a vast
plain, the temperature would probably be found to diminish with some regularity in
proportion to the distance from the western ocean ; but from the operation of causes
referred to in a former paper, the mountain district of Cumberland is an exception

At Seathwaite, the thermometer on the grass has been below the freezing-point in
every month of 1849, except July, when it was 1* above it; and the mean of the
whole absolute minima is 10*5 below the point of congelation.

In January, this thermometer was at or below 32* on seventeen nights; in February,
on ten nights; in March, on fourteen nights; in April, on fifteen nights; in May,
on eight nights; in June, on six nights; in July, on 0 nights; in August, on two
nights; in September, on nine; in October, on 8ixteen ; in November, on fifteen ;
and in December, on twenty-four nights. The thermometer used for showing the
temperature at the surface is a common RuTHERFoRD ; had a more delicate instru-
