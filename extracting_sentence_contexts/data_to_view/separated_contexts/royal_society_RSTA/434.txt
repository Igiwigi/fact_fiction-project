when the explosive is rubbed between metal surfaces. This suggests that an analogous mechanical action is involved in both these tests. The fact that the sensitiveness neither to grit friction nor to heat follows the same sequence
as percussion suggests that percussion sensitiveness is a specific measure of the susceptibility
to mechanical shock or to a pressure pulse, as distinct from the tendency to detonate due to
the formation of local hot spots. MoMENTUM AND ENERGY FACTORS IN THE SENSITIVENESS TO PERCUSSION

(a) Calculation of the velocity of the drift If the velocity of the falling ball of mass M is V before impact and V’ after impact, and
the velocity of the drift of mass m (initially at rest so that v = 0) is v before impact and
v’ after impact and ¢ is the coefficient of restitution, standard theory gives
