Early reports and numerous subsequent ones used XRD data for the identification of 3 |
h diamond. A characteristic feature of the X-ray data from both laboratory-produced and
terrestrial/extraterrestrial samples interpreted as h diamond/lonsdaleite are broad diffraction a
features. The broadness of the XRD reflections, as well as the fact that the most intense c diamond :
reflections coincide with the purported h diamond reflections, complicates the analysis of the
patterns. As a result, the majority of the XRD data were interpreted as physical mixtures of c and
h diamond, and the significant broadening was attributed to small particle sizes [3,4,23]. Even
the early reports [3,4] suggested that the particle size of Canyon Diablo h diamond was below a
few tens of nanometres.
