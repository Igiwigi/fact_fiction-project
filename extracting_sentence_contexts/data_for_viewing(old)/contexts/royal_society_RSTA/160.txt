uage here. Great advantages do arise from the network effect of building
on top of an established, community-supported language. Nevertheless, even
without that, the advantages listed above render XML a very powerful tool;
as an eztensible language, it lends itself well to non-standard, domain-
specific extensions.

One frequently touted advantage of XML is the availability of schemata for
data validation. In practice, though, we have found this to be of negligible use—
indeed, frequently, we find the use of schemata more of a hindrance than a
help, mitigating directly against the levels of extensibility needed for wholesale
data interoperability.

The ability to use ad hoc extensions—in fact, the ability to design and implement
XML dialects and languages on the fly, with varying levels of formality—is a great
part of the attraction of XML to the eScience worker. Interoperability is enhanced
rather than hindered by the ability to embed application-specific data, and to
tailor XML dialects to their domain of use.

Regardless of formal schemata, languages conform to implied rules if tools
can meaningfully process the data. There are questions as to how these
rules might be expressed, and how the expression of these rules should be
governed, but there is no expectation that the answers should be the same for
every community.

Of course, there can be an overhead to encoding data as XML, in terms of
