It is evident that, Z being considered
constant, the last terms of (d.), (e.), (f.) form no part of the diurnal variations, and may
be neglected; omitting them therefore and substituting the values of X and Y given by
(9.) and (A.), the equations (d.), (e.), and (f.) become

As the angles &, |, 3,, and 3, may be regarded as constant for a single day, the equa-

-Stions (7.), (7.), (7".) show that the deviations of the magnets from their normal positions
Sat any two hours whose interval is half a day are equal in amount but opposite in direc-
Stion for each element of the earth's force; but this is quite at variance with the real
A Scharacter of the diurnal variations, the excursions of the magnets being inyariably
S Sextensive on both sides of their normal positions during about eight hours of the day,
Z which include the sun's upper transit, while deviations of comparatively small extent
occur during the remaining hours. SE This discordance will be more conclusively shown if we express the observed variations
Sin the form of the series (2) described hereafter (17), when the coefficients of the second
Eand following terms should be zero, while we find that those of the second and third
A terms have magnitudes not greatly inferior to the coefficient of the first term. Again, it will be shown hereafter (19) that there should be no mean diurnal yaria-
tion for the whole year due to direct action of the sun, while in fact there is such a
yariation of very considerable range, in middle and high magnetic latitudes, which is
opposite in character for the north and south magnetic hemispheres. With respect to the direct action of the sun upon the observed magnets, the first of
the above-mentioned reasons was adduced by Dr. LLoyp as showing the inconsistency
with observation in the law of the diurnal variations as derived from the theory in ques-
tion, in a paper published in the * Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, February
22, 1858.
