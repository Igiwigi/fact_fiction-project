Jhe observation. The same experiment was tried with phosphate of quinine with the
Same result.
s 212. It is stated in Turxer's Chemistry, that the play of colours observed in
Solutions of polychrome (7. e. esculine) is destroyed by acids, and heightened by
Alkalies. The destruction, or at least almost complete destruction, of the blue colour
:Hlue to dispersed light in a decoction of the bark of the horse-chestnut, which is
Sroduced by acids, is readily observed ; but I could not perceive that the addition
af alkalies in the first instance to a fresh solution made any difference one way or
wther. If the blue colour had previously been destroyed by an acid, it was restored
Sy the alkali. If the horse-chestnut had never been examined chemically, these
Sbservations alone would indicate that in all probability the principle to which the
Slue colour was due was capable of entering into firm combination with acids, but
Aid not combine with alkalies. It is, in fact, as we know, a vegetable base.
= 213. A solution of nitrate of uranium in ether is insensible, as if some of the
Flements of the ether entered into firm combination with the oxide of uranium. In
Fonnexion with this circumstance, it is rather remarkable, that although the ether
as8es off by evaporation when the solution is left to itself in an open vessel, if heat
Se applied chemical action sets in, and the residue consists chiefly of a salt which
Fbas all the appearance of oxalate of uranium. This salt, when washed and ex-
amined in the moist state, without very great concentration of light, was found to
be insensible*.

214. It is rare to meet with s0lutions 80 highly sensitive as those of quinine and
esculine, but similar observations may be made on a great number of solutions, by
employing suitable methods. The most searching method consists in forming a
