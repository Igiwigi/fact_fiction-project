we shall see shortly, the evidence in the case of Cs points to the fact that the
denominator of the top line = 2+f, ie. 4 = 1+f; but there may be some uncertainty
here also in view of RypBere’s suggestion that each V of a series may form the limit

of a new series—e.g., not only is there the sharp series VP(1)—VS, but there may
also be VP(2)—VS. Rrrz has given several examples of this. As the matter is
thus open the formula as determined on each supposition is entered in Table IT.

In the P and 8 series « is negative. It is positive in the D series, not only in the
alkalies, but in other typical D series; in fact, so general is the rule, that if any
new series gives @ positive it may be taken at least provisionally as a D series.

(M).—If we write down the values of » of P+yp of D and of p+e for D, we find
the following :—
