Also it led to new results for cosmic ray intensities as
discussed below.

Figure 3. (a) The Hy* R(1,1)"-R(1,0) doublet detected in two dense clouds [24]. (b) The doublet towards the GC IRS 3 star in
the Galactic centre (top trace) and towards Cygnus 0B2 No. 12 behind diffuse cloud [27].

(c) ¢ ~10—s—" for diffuse clouds 10 times higher than dense clouds. The end of
homogeneity of the cosmic ray flux

Observations of several more diffuse clouds showed H3+ column densities of the order of
10!4 cm~? comparable to dense clouds in spite of the fact that their visual extinction is Ay =5-15,
10 times smaller than Ay = 50-150 towards dense clouds [29]. In other words, counterintuitively,
n(H3)/ny is 10 times higher in diffuse clouds than in dense clouds. This suggested that ¢ in
diffuse clouds is much higher than that in dense clouds.
