However,
observing the pinpoints of light on the night sky has probably always inspired
humans to speculate about the existence of other worlds. It is, therefore, not
surprising that there is a long history of thoughts about such a proposition (e.g.
[1-5]). Despite the fact that it is straightforward to imagine that stars other
than the Sun would also host planets, speculations turned into evidence only
fairly recently: in 1992, the first planet around a special type of stellar remnant,
namely pulsars, was found [6], and in 1995, the first detection of a planet around
a star of similar composition to the Sun, namely 51 Peg b, was reported [7]. The
enormous progress in this field is reflected by the fact that, as of 1 June 2010,

like Jupiter and Saturn, some spectacular discoveries of about 20 planets of less
