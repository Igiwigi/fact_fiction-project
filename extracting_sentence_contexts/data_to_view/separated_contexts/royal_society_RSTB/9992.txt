Figure 5. Population sensitivity of neurons recorded in cortical areas V1 and V5/MT. (a) Population sensitivity curves from macaque area V1 for horizontal disparity
as a function of eccentricity near the fovea, reproduced from Prince et al. [30]. (6) Population response curve for horizontal disparity in V5/MT, based on pooling
tesponses from 140 neurons recorded in response to planar fields of drifting random dots; data from Krug et al. [20]. (c) Population sensitivity for V1 neurons plotted
in coordinates of binocular depth and horizontal size for a viewing distance of 30 cm as in figure 3c. (d) Population response of V5/MT neurons in same format as
c. Note the over-representation of binocular depths nearer than the fixation plane, as in DeAngelis & Uka [49].
