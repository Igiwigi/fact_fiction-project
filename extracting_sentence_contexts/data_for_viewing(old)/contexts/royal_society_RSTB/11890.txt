biomass loss from fires.

Although previous findings show tree mortality decreased
as a function of increasing wood density [33], we show that all
wood density classes are at risk of fire-induced mortality,

especially in the first 4 years after the burn. It is important
to note that our results do not show higher susceptibility of
high wood density trees compared to lower wood density
trees to post-fire mortality; instead we show higher stem mor-
tality of high wood density trees in burned forests compared to
unburned controls. One explanation for this high post-fire
mortality across wood density classes reflects the fact that
the full range of wood densities can be found in the small
(i.e.10.0-19.9 cm DBH) and medium (i.e. 20.0-39.9 cm DBH)
size classes, which are the fire-susceptible groups. Smaller
trees are shown to have thinner bark, which in turn are at
more risk of heat stress and fire-induced mortality [11,32].

(c) Post-fire stem gowth and recruitment

The significant loss of large size and emergent trees is likely to
have triggered the increase in the growth of light-dependent
and fast-growing species. As expected, this increase in wood
productivity is associated with the stem growth responses of
