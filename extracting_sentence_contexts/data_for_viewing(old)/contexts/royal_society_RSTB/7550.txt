through the base of the epidermis at the proboscis tip, parallel to and adjoining the nerve-fibre
layer. The majority of the cells are orientated dorso-ventrally with the nucleus near the dorsal
end. bm, basal membrane of epidermis; ci, cilia, with indistinctly stained rootlet bundles;
cn, nucleus of ciliated cell; h, one of Hess’s cells; hn, nucleus of Hess’s cell; n/, nerve-fibre layer.

The tip of the proboscis arises from the apical region of the larva. Larvae of S. horsti,
which were obtained without much difficulty, swim for several hours suspended in the
water like Tornaria larvae, and possess apical tufts of long cilia, which stand out stiffly
or execute slight movements. Sections showed a basi-epithelial concentration of nerve
fibres below the apical tuft, as in the apical plate of a Tornaria. The anterior concentra-
tion of bipolar neurones may therefore be derived from the ganglion cells of the apical
plate, forming in the adult part of a nervous system which is degenerate and simplified.
Their apparent absence in certain individuals may be correlated with the fact that some
batches of larvae (of S. horsti) have the apical tuft much less developed than others. Hess
(1938) suggested that his bipolar neurones were photosensitive cells, though Bullock (1945)
pointed out that their form and position are those of ganglion cells rather than sensory
cells. Removal of the proboscis tip produced no obvious modification of the reactions to
light in Saccoglossus (p. 346), but Crozier (1917) and Hess (1936) described this region as
