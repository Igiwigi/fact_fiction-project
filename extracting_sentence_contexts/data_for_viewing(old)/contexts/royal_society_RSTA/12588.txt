the daily minimum declination) was greatest. Calling any one of these selected days
n, the Greenwich projected sunspot area was put down in separate columns for the
day n, and three previous days n—1, n—2, and n—3. This being done for each of
the 10 days of largest D range in the month, we have 10 spot areas in each of the
four columns headed n, n—1, n—2, and n—3. Summing up and taking means for
each column, we get results representative of the spot area on a representative day,
characterised by a large D range, and on each of the three previous days.

If ARRHENIUS's theory were true, then we should expect the mean spot area for day
n—2 to be decidedly in excess of the means from the other three columns, and also in
excess of the mean derived from all days of the month.

As a matter of fact, when all the months of the 11 years were treated in this
way, and the results combined, the mean spot areas from the four columns were dl in
excess of the mean from all days, and the excess was largest for column 7—3.

As complementary to this investigation, the 10 days of least D range in each month
of the 11 years were got out, and the corresponding sunspot areas were put down for

each of these and the three previous days. In this instance, there was a deficiency in
the mean derived from each of the columns headed n, n—1, 7—2, n—3 as compared to
the average day of the 11 years, and the deficiency was greatest in column n—3.
