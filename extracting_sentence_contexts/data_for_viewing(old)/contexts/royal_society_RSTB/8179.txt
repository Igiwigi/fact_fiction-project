The Playford collection, which for the first time reveals the true characters of the various
forms, fully bears out Uhlig’s judgement. There is a gradation in style of ribbing from large
forms with simple peristome (Pseudotoites) to small forms with lappets (Oftoites, Trilobiti-
ceras, Normannites ?), and the impression is irresistible that they are all more closely related
to one another than to their European counterparts.

Zemistephanus also is certainly a close relative of Pseudotoites and not of Teloceras, which is
much later. Even Pseudotoites at the coronate stage may be confused with Teloceras; and,

in fact, the fragment figured by Neumayr (1885, pl. i, fig. 3) as [ Teloceras] blagdeni (Sow.)
is a Pseudotoites robiginosus (Crick).

It appears that at any given time and place an ammonite stock may by evolutionary
radiation, or deployment, give rise to various ‘genera’, more or less parallel to those
produced by other stocks in other parts of the world at the same or a different time.

The Bajocian provides some other notable examples. One striking case recently described
is that of the genus Ermoceras in Arabia and Sinai (Arkell 1952, pp. 272ff.). Another is the
European genus Emileia. Some of these become inflated and coronate like Teloceras
(Emileia crater Buckman 1920, pl. clxiv), others evolute with reduced body-chamber
(E. catamorpha Buckman, pl. cdxiv), while others develop spines (Frogdenites Buckman 1921,
pl. ccxv). Again, among European Stephanoceras there is a wide range of forms, some con-
