the fact that the tops of several cavities are rounded (figure 1). Vourlidas et al. [13] have found
that at least 40% of CMEs have flux rope structures. The bright core corresponds to the erupting
prominence.

CMESs are purely magnetic phenomena: in the strongly magnetized coronal plasma, where the
plasma f parameter (i.e. the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressures) is much smaller than one,
magnetic field lines act as material lines with plasma ‘frozen in’ along them. Observationally,
CMEs are structures evidently organized by magnetic fields with spatial scales of the order of the
solar radius (Ro) near the Sun, maintaining their apparent structural integrity over at least several
solar radii.

CMEs are preceded by a relatively long phase (of the order few days to weeks) in which
the magnetic field is gradually stressed and free (i.e. non-potential, due to electric currents)
