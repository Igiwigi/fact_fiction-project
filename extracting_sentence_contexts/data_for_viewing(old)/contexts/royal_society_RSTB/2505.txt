Rhinoceros ; 7.¢., in representatives of the lowest mammalian orders, namely, Mono-
tremes, Marsupials, Edentata, and Rodentia, besides a Perissodactyl Ungulate and
Chiroptera, to which latter further reference will be made later on.

IL. Pseudangiotic Type.—Retinal vessels are scarce in numbers, very short, and
minute. They emanate from the optic disc, and extend only as far as the dise or a
short distance beyond it. This is the case chiefly in Hyrax, Elephas, Tapirus, Equus,
Myrmecophaga, Phalangista, Belideus, Petaurus, Perameles obesula, Hypsiprymnus
Dendrolagus, Capybara, Coelogenys, Cavia; i.e., summarised, in the majority of the
Marsupials, Perissodactyls, Edentata, and Rodentia. In some of these animals, notably
in Myrmecophaga and Capybara, these vessels are so minute and short that they
might almost as well be put into the first group. They are in fact intermediate
between, or transitional from, the anangiotic to the angiotic stage, and may be called
pseudangiotie.

IIL. Angiotic Type.—The retinal vessels are of varying calibre. They emanate
from numerous trunks situated at or near the periphery of the disc, and spread over
the greater portion of the retina. This is the case in most of the Carnivora, most
typically in the Felidee, Viverridee, Mephitis, Meles, Ursidie, also amongst Rodents
the Sciuridee, Leporide, and Myoxide. The two latter are in so far intermediate
between the second and third group, as the vessels extend only over a small portion
of the retina, being in the Leporidie restricted to the peculiar transverse expansion of
the white fibres of the optic nerve. Amongst the Carnivora, Nasua (one of the
Procyonide), Lutra, and Herpestes nepalensis approach the next or Luangiotie type.
