Table X shows the head-and-body lengths, and the numbers of specimens, within the
five groups. It shows that all the animals under 115 cm. in head-and-body length are
completely immature, that all those over 125 cm. are mature, and that puberty occurs
at a head-and-body length of about 120cm. These data are further analysed in
Table XI, in which the average head-and-body length, and the range of variation,
within each group are shown. On comparing these values with those given above for the
male, it is seen that, in the female, puberty and physical maturity both occur at a head-
and-body length about 5-0.cm. greater than in that sex. This is due to the fact that the
adult female is a larger animal than the male, as is shown by fig. 25, in which the size
frequencies for each sex are plotted separately. If the sexes grow at the same rate the
female must be older than the male on reaching puberty, whereas, if puberty is reached
at the same age in both sexes, the female must grow more rapidly. If the amount of
tooth-wear can be taken as roughly indicating comparative ages, a proposition which
appears to be reasonable, the data in Table XII show that the first of these two alterna-
tives is the correct one. In this table the numbers of prepubertal and mature animals,
per cent of the total of each sex, are arranged according to the amount of tooth-wear
(= age), and the earlier onset of puberty in the male is clearly seen.
