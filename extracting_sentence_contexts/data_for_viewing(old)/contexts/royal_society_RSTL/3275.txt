follow the same laws in their development. Thus whether a muscular fibre or a
nervous tabe is destined to be formed, the foundation of both consists of vesicles or
* cells,” which have arisen in the manner above described; and it is through the
modifications which the vesicles undergo, that a muscular fibre on the one hand, or
a neryous tube on the other, is produced. © In short, there is for all the elementary
parts of organisms a common principle of development.”

291. It will be interesting to refer to a few of the facts recorded in the foregoing
and the previous memoir, in connexion with the analogy now mentioned ; and if
those facts should be found in any way to exemplify it, they will not be the less ad-
missible from my having observed them in the course of researches in which this
analogy formed no part of the object I was in pursuit of.

292. Both the nucleus and nucleolus were figured in my © First Series,” in the
peculiar granules, or rather vesicles of the ovisac, though I was ignorant of their im-
portance. Tt will be seen indeed that those peculiar granules (vesicles) form a part
of more than fifty figures in that paper, and that the nucleus is represented in almost
every instance where the size admitted of it. This is mentioned merely to show that
those objects (the nucleus and nucleolus) were not overlooked, for to SCHLEIDEN
belongs the merit of first pointing out the nature of those objects in plants, and to
