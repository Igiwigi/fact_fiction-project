We make no attempt to decide between them, and indeed regard the qr
insoluble, in the absence alike of developmental facts and of satisfacto y
for comparative study. We prefer to leave the whole question open, and,
ally, to speak of the sporangiophore as a pedicel simply, without preju
possible homologies. ;

Our knowledge of the organization of Sphenophyllum is now fairly comp .

roots, nor to give any detailed account of the leaves. Considerable inforn

affinities. That it is a vascular Cryptogam there can be no doubt, nor has thi
questioned by any modern writer. Among the vascular Cryptogams, Spheng
