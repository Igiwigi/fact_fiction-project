The List I.—actual errors a minimum—appears the better, in view of the fact that
some of the corrections are within R. and P.’s estimates, and that they are generally
smaller than in II. It would, perhaps, have been advisable to use these corrected
values in determining N by least squares, but the work had been done before


102 PROF. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES.

RAYLEIGH’s results were published. The work of applying the method to the six
series is exceedingly laborious, and as the corrections themselves are not quite free
from doubt, it did not seem worth while to recalculate. In any case, it is not probable
that the actual values of N would be greatly altered. All six series have been treated
in the same way, the observations being weighted in accordance with R. and P.’s
