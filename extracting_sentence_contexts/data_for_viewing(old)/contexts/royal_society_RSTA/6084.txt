Representative results from the sensing system validation experiments are shown in figure 5.
The figure depicts the electrical response of six sensors to indentation (figure 5aâ€”c) and to shear
tests (figure 5d), as defined above. Figure 5a,b shows the six sensors capturing the dynamic
features of the mechanical event by generating two phasic bursts in charge-mode output signals.
The bursts correspond to the press and release events, while there was almost no response in-
between. The contact onset is associated with a decrease whereas contact release generates a
signal increase. The signal peaks are arranged in sequence reflecting the fact that the touches
were applied to the sensors sequentially. Figure 5c shows that the sensing system can capture
multiple touches when they were applied simultaneously. Finally, figure 5d shows a sliding
pattern that started on the palm, crossed the volar side of the index finger and ended on the
fingertip of the index finger. The plot indicates that the six sensors responded to the shear tests
and that the sliding direction could be easily inferred from the sequence of sensor activations.
Interestingly, the sensor response pattern is in this case more complex; the press and release peaks
are still visible, but they are not as sharp as in figure 5a,b. This reflects a different sensor response
to the different type of mechanical interaction (shear forces). The sliding movement provoked
more gradual activation and deactivation of the sensors compared to previous indentation tests.
A number of interesting patterns are shown in figure 5d. They can actually reveal how shear
information on the surface of the skin is translated into normal stress that is measured by
the piezoelectric polymer sensors working in thickness mode. While in such a configuration
