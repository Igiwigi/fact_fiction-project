The implements,
on the other hand, found at Ipswich (Plate 56, figs. 1-4), and at Axminster (Plate 57,
figs. 1-4), do not exhibit the flat ventral surface. In fact this surface has been
replaced by a ventral ridge and the section of the implements has become roughly
rhomboidal. In 1911 Sir Ray Lanxesrer described before the Royal Society the series of
flint implements found beneath the Pliocene Red Crag of Suffolk, to which he gave
the name of “rostro-carinate.” Of these particular specimens he states* : “In the
Pre-Crag implements the anterior narrow edge, though tending to the vertical, is
strongly curved and gives the implement the form of the beak of an accipitrine bird.
