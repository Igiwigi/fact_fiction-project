work, the best starting place is [59]; the technically field-theoretic nature of Bourdieu’s approach
is defended in [60]). Collins envisions actors going from one ‘interaction ritual’ to another,
with successful interaction rituals increasing the emotional energy of at least some participants.
The phenomenological, indeed, physiognomic, plausibility of an account of emotional energy is
impressive—we not only feel buoyed up in some situations, but depression and stress take their
toll on the physical structure of the body.

However, if we take the notion of emotional energy as literally as we can, we must puzzle over
the question of how it is stored—the person who was buoyed up returns to calm, but may re-start
social interactions the next day with more confidence.!? Perhaps this question turns out to be
the same that a rigorous field-theoretic interpretation of Bourdieu would begin with: How does
the potential energy in fields develop? While recognizing the great difference between the uses of
There are a few theorists who have understood the theoretically generative nature of the fact that one may move between

considering non-independence as a flux of information or a flux of energy, and that we are free to layer an informational
interpretation on top of an energetic distribution. Here see Granger [54].

1°}t was Benjamin D. Zablocki who brought this issue to my attention.


‘field’ in these two senses (that of classic field theory and that of a Markov Random Field), it might
help to imagine the sorts of interaction rituals that Collins discusses as specific social groups that
are technically cliques, and that the total social energy of some social order can be partitioned into
that associated with such different cliques in a Gibbs distribution that is correlative to a Markov
Random Field. Such an outrageously abstract claim might seem worse than useless, if it only
