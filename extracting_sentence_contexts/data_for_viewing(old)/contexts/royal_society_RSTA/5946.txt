and enforcing the PDE as an equality on H~1(D). Existence and uniqueness of weak solutions
with initial data in L*(D) follows (see, e.g. [52]).

Remark 2.3. A particular consequence of the previous remark that will be used throughout the
proof of proposition 2.1 is that
(u- VT,T)=0 fora. t,

if u and T are as in the proposition. This follows from a smooth approximation argument and the
fact that T(., f) € Hj(D) a.e. in t. Indeed, if T(-, t) is smooth and compactly supported in D then

by the divergence theorem. The bilinear form T+> (u- VT,T) is continuous on H}(D), per (2.2).
The claimed identity follows from the density of smooth and compactly supported functions in

Remark 2.4. In the case that u and f are steady, the bounds from the proposition become sharp
