The same remark applies to the
ectric stress. Also, in (150) to (155) we overlook the Poynine flux. I am not
gure how far this is intentional on Professor Herrz’s part, but its neglect does not
fem to give a sufficiently comprehensive view of the subject.

It is the last term of (156) and the last term of (157), together, which bring in the
