Sellke (1936)
performed the complementary experiment of reducing the haltere frequency by loading
the stalk while leaving the wing-beat frequency unchanged. On the other hand, the state-
ment made by both Braun (1939) and Sellke (1936) that the movements of flight have no
effect on the haltere is not strictly true. Some explanation is required of the undoubted
fact that in the normal fly the two frequencies are identical. In Diptera, as in most insects, the main movement of the wings is produced by distortion
of the whole of the skeleton of the thorax by vertical and longitudinal indirect muscles. That this has an effect on the halteres is shown by the following experiments on Calliphora:
