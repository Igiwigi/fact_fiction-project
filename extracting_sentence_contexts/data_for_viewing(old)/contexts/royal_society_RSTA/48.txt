about the nature of the interactions on and in a body, the more we can be sure about the
identification of the appropriate balance equations.

Then we furnish information (indirectly in a sense) on the essential aspects of the material
structure through the state functions, the so-called constitutive relations, which link what
we have selected as state variables (another modelling choice) to the interactions within
the body under analysis. Experimental data address the selection but there is certain
arbitrariness in the choice. The second law of thermodynamics and the requirement that
the structure of the physical laws should not change under changes in observers impose
a priori theoretical restrictions on the possible constitutive choices. The decision to adopt
these constraints is philosophical and requires some concepts to be specified. We need,
in fact, to clarify what kind of expression of the second law we consider. We also find it
necessary to define the nature of the observers (and the one of observable quantities) and
the classes of their changes.

In classical mechanics, an observer is a frame in the ambient physical space and a time
scale. Once we assign it, we impose some basic elements of our models objectivity, i.e.
invariance with respect to rigid-body-type changes in observers, or covariance, which
involves non-rigid changes of coordinate frames in space. These requirements determine
non-trivial consequences. For example, in the description of the (isothermal) elastic
behaviour of bodies called simple for their energy depends only on the first spatial
derivative of the deformation, in the presence of large strains the requirement of
objectivity for the energy (two observers differing by a rigid-body motion must evaluate
the same internal energy of the body under analysis) implies the physical incompatibility
