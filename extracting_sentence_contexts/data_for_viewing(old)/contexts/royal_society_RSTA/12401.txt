and in the consideration of the supply of energy at certain places, combined with the
continuous transmission of electrical disturbances, and therefore of the associated
energy, the idea of a flux of energy through space, and therefore of the continuity of
energy in space and in time, becomes forced upon us as a simple, useful, and necessary
principle, which cannot be avoided.

When energy goes from place to place, it traverses the intermediate space. Only
&y the use of this principle can we safely derive the electromagnetic stress from the
Quations of the field expressing the two laws of circuitation of the electric and
agnetic forces ; and this again becomes permissible only by the postulation of the
fefinite localisation of the electric and magnetic energies. But we need not go so far
a to assume the objectivity of energy. This is an exceedingly difficult notion, and
Seems to be rendered inadmissible by the mere fact of the relativity of motion, on
iphich kinetic energy depends. We cannot, therefore, definitely individualise energy
B the same way as is done with matter.
