584 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE

15. As8uming the existence of these relations, we have for the determination of the
numerical coefficients in each relation a set of linear equations, which are shown by the
following Tables, viz. referring to the Table headed cA, 5B, aC, 4.1234, if the multipliers
of terms respectively be A, B, C, X, then the Table denotes the system of linear equations

0 A +3B + 33C + 0X=0,
3 A +0B —102C —16X=0,
&c.,

that is, nine equations to be satisfied by the ratios of the coefficients A, B, C, X, and which
are in fact satisfied by the values at the foot of the Table, viz. A:B:OC:X=66: —11: +1: +6. There would be in all fourteen Tables, but as those for the s8econd 8even would be at
once deducible by symmetry from the first seven, I have only written down the seven
Tables; the solutions for the first and second Tables were obtained without difficulty,
but that for the third Table was 80 laborious to calculate, and contains such extraordinarily
high numbers, that I did not proceed with the calculation, and it is accordingly only the
first, second, and third Tables which have at the foot of them respectively the solutions
of the linear equations.
