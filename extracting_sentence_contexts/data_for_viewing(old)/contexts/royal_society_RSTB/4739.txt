water, causing a brilliant colour ; or (2) a membrane or membranes, of chitin, too thin,
too irregular, or too opaque to cause colour when dry, can absorb water and swell, so
as to oppose when wet a homogeneous thin film to the passage of light. If either of
these suppositions were true, pressure under a convex lens should cause distortion or
compression of the aqueous layer and consequently loss of colour. When this

experiment was tried, it was found that quite moderate pressures caused the green
colour to disappear and to be replaced by a dull yellow bronze. However, if the wing
was kept moist, the colour instantly and completely returned on removing the
pressure. The fact that water is specific in its action, and that no other fluid will serve
the same purpose, suggests that there is a film which, like gelatin, can only absorb
water. Acids also appear to restore the green colour, rendering it fairly permanent,
presumably because they are more easily absorbed. If this is the true explanation, it
is perhaps curious that there should be no traces of this membrane in cross-sections.
Plate 3, fig. 1, is a transverse section through the horny part of the fore wing, not
far from its membranous tip, mounted in Canada balsam. Careful comparisons
between sections mounted in aqueous media and others mounted in anhydrous media
with exactly the same refractive index,* such as absolute glycerol, show no appreciable
difference. In the figure this cuticle is shown at c, where it has become detached.
Under the cuticle lies a clear yellow layer of chitin, 7, and below this again a broad
layer, covered with strize, 7. These can have uo effect on the colour, because they are
situated too deeply. It should be mentioned that special attention was at first paid
