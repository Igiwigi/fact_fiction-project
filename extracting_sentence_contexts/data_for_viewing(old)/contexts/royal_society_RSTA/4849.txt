abbreviate this by letting the Pauli matrices be implicit, thus writing

Clearly, there is a freedom of choice when a null vector is thus factorized into spinors, by 14: > : a

If desired, the Dirac equation can readily be expressed in terms of 2-spinors, but it becomes
a pair of coupled spinor equations, rather than a single equation. This might seem a loss of
simplicity, but this separation of the electron into left- and right-handed parts is consistent with
its modern interpretation in the standard model. It should also be noted that, when extending
the 2-spinor calculus to general relativity (one of Roger Penrose’s early achievements), there is
no analogue of the 4-spinors. Thus for a number of reasons, 2-spinor calculus may be seen as the
most fundamental to the modern description of space-time and matter.

Another beautiful feature of 2-spinor algebra is that the space of projective 2-spinors is simply
