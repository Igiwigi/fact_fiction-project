CALCIUM CARBONATE AND ITS HYDRATES 163

Numerous cases of such retardation have been observed; for example, interference with
crystallization by impurities, or even its total inhibition, is very common in organic
chemistry; the prevention of crystallization of potassium sulphate by quinoline yellow and
other dyes which colour the crystals is described by Marc & Wenk (1910); and Calgon is
known to hold up the precipitation of calcium carbonate to an extent which is only partly
accounted for by the formation of soluble complex ions (Hatch & Rice 1939). Our own
observations show that Calgon may suppress the formation of nuclei of calcite, and even
prevent the growth of calcite seed grains, while nucleation and growth of calcium carbonate
hexahydrate proceeds readily.

Such facts lead to the suggestion that Calgon may permit the precipitation of unstable
phases by interfering with precipitation of the other possible phases to differing extents
under varying conditions. The apparent stabilization of calcium carbonate hexahydrate
by bromthymol blue, reported by Dorfmiiller (1938), may have been due to prevention of
crystallization of the truly stable phase, and it is possible that sugar in high concentration
behaves similarly and its presence is the reason why calcium carbonate hexahydrate is
easily prepared from sugar-limes. Similar speculations are reasonable to account for the
formation of calcium carbonate hexahydrate in the presence of the blood of crayfish
(Biitschli 1908).

The mechanism may be complex. It is possible that partial inhibition of nucleation may
result in such a rise in concentration of the solution that supersolubility limits of several
metastable phases are exceeded. It may be that almost complete inhibition of growth of
