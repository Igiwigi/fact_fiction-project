Besides fibre-bundles passing out to terminate in the muscle coats there are also
given off from AUERBACH’s plexus fine fibre-bundles which pass up through the circular
muscle to MrissNer’s plexus (fig. 4). In the ganglion figured, the bundle was torn in
making the preparation. These bundles are formed partly by fibres originating in one
or other of the plexuses and partly by vagal fibres which end in relation to the neurones
in the sub-mucous plexus.

Tn the corium of the villi and round the crypts of LreBERKUHN is a complex network of
anastomosing fibres, which form a dense sub-epithelial plexus. The fibres forming this
plexus originate partly as axones of cells in Mrtssner’s plexus and partly from extrinsic
fibres of vagal or sympathetic origin (probably from both these latter sources). The
fact that stimulation of the vagus causes increased secretion of the gastric glands (ANREP
and Sussa Rav, unpublished observations) suggests that processes of neurones in either
the myenteric or sub-mucous plexus are involved in the production of this secretory
reaction. Fibres from the sub-mucous plexus certainly pass up to terminate in relation
to the musculature of the villi (fig. 28), and it seems probable that fibres from this plexus

also provide the efferent innervation of the glandular crypts.

Fine fibrils from the just-mentioned sub-epithelial plexus penetrate the epithelium
of the villi and terminate around and between the epithelial cells (fig. 27, Plate 33),
