The higher expression observed this light intensity, the need for a mechanism of light energy


dissipation is weak. Compared with ML conditions, both qNi
and qNs have significantly increased whereas qNf remained
unchanged (see electronic supplementary material, table
SD5.3). This result fits well with the fact that under ML
photon flux density, the expression of the genes coding the
proteins of the PSII reaction centre (psbA: D1, and psbD:
D2) and those catabolizing the photodamaged PSII reaction
center (FTSH1 and FTSH2) remain stable [9]. The gene psbD
codes the photosystem II reaction centre D2 protein, one of
the proteins with the highest turnover rate under stress con-
ditions [54]. Because qNs is linked to photoinhibition, the
significant increase in this parameter suggests that the
excess of light energy activates both the xanthophyll cycle
and_ photoinhibition.
