Consider a population of wild-type cooperators
(‘W’) in which an uncooperative, selfish cheater (‘c’) arises through mutation or migration. In a mixed population, the selfish
cheater benefits from the cooperative behaviour of the cooperators, without paying the cost. Consequently, the selfish cheater
has a higher fitness than the cooperators and spreads through the population, despite the fact that this leads to a decline in
mean fitness (redrawn from Nowak 2006; West et al. 20076). This figure illustrates the problem of cooperation—our main
aim in this paper is to discuss how this problem can be exploited for medical intervention strategies.
