But the form of rectification considered by him and
Williams, in assuming that elements like temperature and humidity effect trend reversals
by inducing the insect to reverse its reactions, places all the responsibility for the trend-
creation on the insect, an unnecessarily complicated hypothesis as to its behaviour. This
theory overlooks the fact that insect-wind relations already provide a basis for trend-creation
and trend-reversal, so that elements like temperature and humidity can have a positive but
indirect trend-creating influence. EssAYs IN THE INTERPRETATION OF ACTUAL MIGRATION TRENDS

Until continuous observations on behaviour and weather have been made we shall not
know how far the various suggested rectifying processes are in fact responsible for the
migration trends revealed by cartographical methods. Meanwhile, some essays in the
interpretation of actual migration trends will serve to illustrate the suggestions made.
