investigation show that excitation of the cord as high as the 13th dorsal posterior
segment evokes movements in the lower limb, This apparent discrepancy is, it will
be seen, a proof of the position just advanced, since it shows that the uppermost
nerve centre containing motor representation of the lower limb received afferent
impulses by means of the posterior root, which is two or three segments higher
(nearer the cerebrum). Evidence of a like kind is afforded by anatomical researches.

In the first place, Scuutrze found that after damage to the cervical enlargement
a comma-shaped area of descending degeneration occurred in the posterior columns,
Bareacct found also after a transverse lesion of the cord that scattered descending
degeneration could be found throughout the whole breadth of the posterior column.

The most important anatomical fact, however, is the well-known discovery by
Ramon-y-Casat, confirmed by KériKer, Rerzrus, and Gore, that the posterior
root fibres divide almost immediately upon their entrance into the cord into two main
branches, one ascending and one descending. I venture to provisionally suggest
that the ascending branch is, perhaps, chiefly concerned with sensory (7.e., cerebral)

impulses, and the lower branch with local sensori-motor reflex actions,

Tt has also been shown in the horse that there is a difference in level between the
