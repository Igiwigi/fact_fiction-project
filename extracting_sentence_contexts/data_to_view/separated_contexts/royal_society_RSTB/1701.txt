The
petioles, it is true, are often somewhat winged on their upper edges, but such wings
are quite distinct from the emergences, which may arise from any part of the
surface. That they are not wings is shown by the fact that in a series of sections —
of the same petiole, their position never remains constant. Further evidence as to '
their real form is afforded by the fact that in longitudinal sections their appearance —
iv essentially the same as in transverse section (see Memoir XVIL., fig. 8), and also
by the fact that the cross section of the emergence itself is circular (loc. cit.). :

We have figured a peculiar form of these emergences, which is not unfrequently
met with (see Plate 23, fig. 12).
