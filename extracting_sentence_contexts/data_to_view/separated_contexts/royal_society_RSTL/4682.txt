By treating the residue with additional quantities of alum-liquor more
is dissolved with the same colour, and this continues until either the alizarine or the
yerantine, whichever of the two was present in the smallest quantity, is removed. From
this experiment I am inclined to conclude that alizarine and verantine are capable of
forming a double compound with alumina soluble in boiling water, and that a mix-
ture of the two in the proportion in which they exist in this compound, constitutes
what has been called purpurine. At all events, it follows that alum is not adapted
as a means of separating the substances derived from madder. 'The fact of rubianine
also dissolving in boiling alum-liquor and crystallizing out again on cooling, is an
additional objection to its use. The difficulty of obtaining pure verantine in sufficient quantity for the purposes of
analysis, has prevented me from determining its composition with the requisite accu-
racy. TI have however obtained approximations sufficiently near to remove almost all
doubts on the question.
