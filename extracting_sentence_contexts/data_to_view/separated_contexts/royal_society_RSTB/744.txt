Thus while in Gallus the limbs undergo, subsequently
to the fourth day, a backward shifting equal to the length of about six to eight
mesoblastic somites, in an Apteryx of the corresponding age the adult position is
already attained. The ontogenetic shifting of the limbs of birds is very generally taken as evidence
of a corresponding phylogenetic shifting. If this conclusion is correct—and there
seems no reason to doubt it—the fact just described would seem to show that the
interval separating Apteryx from its hypothetical short-necked ancestor is a wider
one than has intervened in the case of Gallus. It must be remembered, however,
that, according to Firerincer (11, p. 977), a forward displacement of the limbs
occasionally occurs instead of the usual backward displacement, especially in the case
of species with degenerating wings. The first two visceral folds (mandibular, Mn., and hyoid, Hy.) are considerably
larger than the third, fourth, and fifth (figs.
