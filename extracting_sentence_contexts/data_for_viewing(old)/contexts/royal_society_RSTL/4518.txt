poses the water, by which a polarity is given to the hydrogen, which causes it to
combine with the nitrogen of the nitric acid to form ammonia, by which combination
the other particles of the nitric acid become in their turn polar and oxidize again the
zinc; the action, as it were, proceeding from and returning back again to that ele-
ment. The change, for example, may be represented thus:â€”

+ = + = + =
H, O., Zn, Zn, O, N=NH,+6ZnO.

6. To the preceding experiments I will only add the phenomena of substitution,
which, viewed in relation to them, assume a new form. The division of the chlorine
which takes place in substitntion is a very similar fact to that distribution of the ele-
ment which takes place in the formation of chloro-sulphuric acid (which I have be-
fore cited), and admits of a similar explanation. The problem is, why, with even
the smallest quantity of chlorine, does a portion of the chlorine ever combine with
the organic body? Why is the hydrogen never simply removed? The solution is,
that one of these two changes determines the other, precisely as the combination with
olefiant gas determines the combination with salphurous acid. Nor do I see what in-
telligible distinction is to be drawn between the action of chlorine on the organic
body and that of hydrogen on nitric oxide, or between either of these two cases and
that of water itself on chloro-sulphuric acid. The organic body behaves as though
it were a simple compound of hydrogen on the one hand, and the remaining ele-
