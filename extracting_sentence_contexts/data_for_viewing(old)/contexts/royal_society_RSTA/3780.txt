unprecedented electronic and thermal properties [4-7], which can be traced to its charge carriers
having zero effective mass (the so-called Dirac fermions) and extremely large mean free path. This
leads to very large thermal conductivity and high carrier mobility [8] and therefore provides an
excellent materials platform for management of thermal processes in nanoelectronic circuits and
high-frequency electronics [9-11]. Equally important, the physical properties of graphene can be
readily and ultrafast tuned via chemical doping or electric gating, which makes it particularly
appealing for technological applications in the area of ultrafast and active optoelectronic devices.

One field where the tunability of graphene could play a key role is photonics. This is primarily
due to the fact that the dielectric constant of graphene is strongly dependent on the carriers
density via the Fermi energy, which means that by chemical doping or electric gating one can
change the dielectric constant of graphene, in relative terms, by much more than it can be done

in the case of most other optical materials. Because generally the dielectric constant (index of : =
refraction) is the main physical quantity that determines the optical properties of a material, the : a
