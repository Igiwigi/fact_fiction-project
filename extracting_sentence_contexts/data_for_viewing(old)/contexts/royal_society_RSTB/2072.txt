88 DR. D. H. SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES

each stele, (2) that this stem bore leaves with petioles like those of Myeloaylon
Landriotii, and (3) that it gave rise to triarch adventitious roots.

We will now proceed to examine the various structures more in detail, and then
to consider the facts observed in their bearing on the affinities of our plant and of
the Medullosese generally.

3. The Steles.

The individual steles, as seen in a transverse section of the stem, vary much in
dimensions, reaching from 2 to 3 centims. in their greater, and from 6 to 10 millims.
in their lesser diameter. Their form is sometimes fairly regular, as in one of the
steles represented in Plate 6, photograph 5; while in others, as shown in the same
preparation, the transverse section is irregularly lobed.

The whole interior of each stele, as already stated, is occupied by the primary
wood, which consists of elements of two kinds—tracheides and parenchymatous cells.
