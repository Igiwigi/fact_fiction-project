the mass, but is either clinging to it, or to the cell-wall. This solid precipitate in
the cell is, in fact, the inulin, which in the fresh scale remains dissolved in the cell-
sap; on the penetration of the alcohol it is precipitated and takes the form of the
cell, in which it is held, enclosing the starch-grains. These casts can easily be
liberated from the walls surrounding them, and can be seen under the microscope
floating about as isolated masses, holding the starch-grains. If a starch-grain be
freed from a cast, then a circular depression remains in it, showing where it was
retained.
