A simple approach to regularizing with respect to the number of states combines the
negative log likelihood (NLL) of the HMM given estimated values of the parameters with the
Akaike information criterion [39]:

AIC=NLL+K. (4.6)

The number of states K leading to a minimum in equation (4.6) is taken as the correct number
of states. HMMs are special kinds of Bayes networks [38], which include classical signal processing
methods, such as the Kalman filter, but also clustering methods, such as the Gaussian mixure
model (GMM). In fact, the Gaussian HMM popular in biophysical contexts can also be understood
as a time-dependent version of the GMM. This also connects with the clustering described
above, in that K-means clustering can be seen as a special case of the GMM where the most
probable assignment of time samples to clusters is used rather than the probability of each sample
belonging to a cluster as in the GMM [16]. The EM algorithm is very general.
