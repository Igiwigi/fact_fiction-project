This point will be referred to again in
Part VII. Another curious effect was noticed while the above tests were in progress, namely, that
with oblique lines the image broke down to produce spurious images much more readily
than was the case either with horizontal or vertical lines. This fact also will be referred to
again later (see Part XII).

(43) The effect of light intensity

It will be recollected that in previous tests an increase in light intensity had the effect
of decreasing the visual angle at which loss of colour occurred. A tenfold increase in
intensity was found to halve approximately the visual angle. The same relationship was
found to hold in the case of a yellow-blue grating, as table 38 shows.
