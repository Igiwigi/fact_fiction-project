of this type, while Slepyan’s original paper and book have been cited around 200 times.

There is not a single paper on molecular dynamics of fracture that could not benefit if the
author was familiar with Slepyan’s work. The natural reaction of most workers in the area is
that Slepayn’s calculations are carried out in two-dimensional lattices with idealized potentials
and therefore cannot stand up to the realistic results available from modern computers. This
is a superficial point of view. The computer calculations all risk being unrealistic in their
own way. This is not just because the potentials are all approximate and never actually come
from first principles [8, §11.8] as often is implied. The larger problem is that the length and
time scales available to computer simulations are profoundly different from those available
to any laboratory experiment. Computers can simulate directly billions of atoms for times of
nanoseconds. Experiments deal with 107° atoms and time scales from milliseconds to seconds
or more. Thus, the fact that Slepyan’s framework makes it possible to work in the limit of infinite
time and infinite numbers of atoms makes the toy calculations in some significant respects more
realistic than billion-atom direct simulation.

The qualitative picture that emerges from results such as those in figure 6 is illuminating.
Expect zero-temperature cracks to be trapped in metastable minima for loading conditions above
the Griffith threshold. Expect the existence of dynamical states before the end of lattice trapping.


Expect the emission of phonon radiation from a moving crack. Expect the possibility that cracks
can reach a steady state, and that the steady state will be marked by the symmetry in equation
(1.4). Expect that from a molecular point of view, the universal stress fields of fracture mechanics
represent an outer asymptotic limit, and this can be used to connect microscopic computations to
