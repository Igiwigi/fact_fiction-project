Since 1938 Southwell and his collaborators have solved very many and important pro-
blems involving partial differential equations by an arithmetical method which he has
named ‘relaxation’. A recent summary by him is in book form (1946). I suppose—though
this may be controversial—that ‘relaxation’ is sufficiently alike to ‘purification’ for the
choice of purifiers to have some relevance to relaxation.

In connexion with the historical development, Sir Richard Southwell has drawn my
attention to a remarkably extensive, though still incomplete, bibliography prepared by
T. J. Higgins (1949). Higgins found that Runge (1908-9) was the first to apply finite
differences to the partial differential equation of Saint-Venant’s torsion problem. Incident-
ally, I must protest against Higgins’s suggestion that there is a contrast between iteration
and what he calls Richardson’s method of ‘normal functions’. For, in fact, I cleaned away
unwanted normal functions by iteration.

The present comparison of techniques will, however, relate to my paper of 1910. The
phraseology of cleaning was not then mentioned, but in retrospect it seems appropriate.
Differential equations were replaced by difference equations, and the approach to the limit
was deferred (Richardson & Gaunt 1927), so that all the operations were on finite sets of
arithmetical numbers. [Bogoliouboff & Kryloff (1928), who called this‘ Rayleigh’s Principle’,
evaluated the error committed at the nth approximation. There are numerous related papers
by Kryloff.] Other broad resemblances between the treatment of the matrices and that of
