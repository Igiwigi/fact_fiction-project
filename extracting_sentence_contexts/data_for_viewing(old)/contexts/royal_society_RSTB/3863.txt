(2) The Andrecium presents a limiting term (though not the absolute minimum
of two) curiously paralleled by that of Crucifers and some Capparids (Cleome) among
the Rheadinee, in that, as in these types with a tangentially extending flower,
six members give a minimum symmetrical arrangement, in which two lateral
members are given free room, while median members in the plane of the gyncecium
are avoided. That is to say, six has advantages over four or eight. Just as the
six stamens of the Crucifer or Cleome suggest the ancestral more numerous series
(Polanisia, Reseda) in a single whorl, and these in turn the multicycled type of
Papaver and Capparis, clearly the relic of an indefinite construction originally
repeating the Fibonacci systems of the vegetative shoots, so the six stamens of
Welwitschia, in a true developmental whorl, postulate an originally greater number
(Cycadeoidea), and through these afford the only direct indication of the fact that
the ancestral Welwitschia presented normal Fibonacci systems before it became
decussate.

(3) The Gynecium in both flowers is clearly the ultimate limit of one free
integumented ovule. There is no need to trace fancied homologies with the single
basal ovule of Polygonum or Juglans among Angiosperms any more than with
