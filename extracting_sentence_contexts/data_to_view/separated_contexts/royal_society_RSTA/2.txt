The term “stretching” then requires an explanation in connection with. .Davison’s paper. The stretching which we have to consider is, in fact, simply the

@xcess of the actual stretching above that due to rise of temperature. The negative
@f such stretching is a contraction, and it would actually be shown by a crumpling
Sof strata.
6 if p be the density of a body, and ¢ its modulus of linear expansion for temperature,
®khen it is obvious that when the temperature is raised 0 degrees the density becomes
op (1 — 34). Now suppose that a spherical shell of radius 7 expands so that its
‘radius becomes 7(1-+ «), and suppose that at the same time its temperature is raised
0 degrees.
