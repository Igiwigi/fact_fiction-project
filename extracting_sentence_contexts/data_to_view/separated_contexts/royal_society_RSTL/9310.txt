Obviously the six squares

(Vo), (VP, (Ve), (AY (VeY, (Vf)?

are a hexad, viz. : each of these is a linear function of 1, ©+y, «y, and therefore
selecting any three of them, each of the remaining three can be expressed as a linear
function of these. But further the squares (Va), (V/b)?, (ab)?, (Ved)?, (Vee)?, (de)? form a
8 hexad. For reverting to the expression obtained for (4/ab)*—(/cd)?, the determinant
- contained therein is a linear function of aa, and bb, that is of (Va)? and (vb)? ; we
= in fact haye

bt (a—d) | 1, z+y, zy | =(b—c)(b—d)(a—2)(a—y)—(a—c<)(a—4)b—2)(b—y). E | 1, a+b, ab

FS Hence (V/ab)*—(vcd)? is a linear function of (4/a)?, (vb)? ; and by a mere inter-
S change of letters (/ab)*—(x/ce)?, (Vab)%—(v/de)?, are each of them also a linear

A function of (va)? and (/b)?; whence the theorem. And we have thus all the

SE remaining 15 hexads.
