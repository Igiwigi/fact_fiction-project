$41. In cells of the ordinary type the principal source of weakness is in
perfect sealing at the top, due to cracks in the paraffin wax. As pointed out by D
ArLveR WrGon,* « better result is obtained if the whole cell be imbedded in a lar;
mass of wax than wherr (as in my cells) the wax is applied merely inside the tube,
above the cork sustaining the zine. During the last year T have replaced para
by marine glue, which, s0 far as can be judged at present, may be relied upon to
effect a complete seal. The procedure will be described presently more in detail.

The cause of failure in the H-cells is of a different nature. Many of the earlier
cells had been found to break in the amalgam leg, and the trouble was attributed to a
hardening and expansion of the contents ($ 29). Such a hardening had, in fact, been”
observed in one or two cages. More recent experience, however, has proved that the
cause must be looked for elsewhere, several cells having failed in which no trace of
solid amalgam was to be found. Nevertheless the amalgam is the cause of the
trouble, for out of a large number of breakages not one has occurred in the leg con-
taining pure mercury. It would appear that some alloying takes place with the
platinum wire in contact with the amalgam, and that this gradually extends itself
with fatal results to the part of the platinum sealed into the glass, from which
place the cracks are always observed to radiate. It is hoped thab a cure will be
found in a plan, adopted for some recent cells, of melting in a little cement (marine
glue has been used) 80 as to protect from the amalgam the parb of the platinum
which lies nearest to the glass ; but it is too 800n to speak with certainty.
