To make the investigation complete we have
to vary as much as possible the pressure, the bore of the vacuum tube, and the strength
of the spark. I have chosen Oxygen as a firs subject of investigation. Though P1vyoreR and
WoLixeR have, as far as their experiments went, accurately described the phenomena
8een in oxygen tubes, the following paper contains much that is new, and will put
some of the older facts on a firmer basis. When T firs began to work, it was my
intention to take the gases in groups, and to study their mixture ; bub as the follow-
ing investigation has taken me a year's nearly continuous work, and is complete in
itself, I trust it will not be found unworthy of publication. I must, of course, at
present confine myself to the purely spectroscopic point of view.
