as well as the parent-corpuscles from which they were escaping. Seldom have I had
s0 favourable an opportunity for observing the manner in which the blood-corpuscle
is perpetuated (fig. 141.33), and for making the observations I have now to mention,
—that the young blood-corpuscle has a peculiarly bright colour, and—though in
Mammalia—an elliptical form. The young corpuscle s00n becomes round, though
at first it continues flat ; the latter no doubt answering an important end connected
with its motion in the vessels.

167. Fig. 141. affords a proof that the diameter of the corpuscles usually seen in
circulation, is no criterion by which to judge whether red blood can make its way
into parts generally considered colourless. Por, at «, a portion of vessel is filled with
corpuscles, having a diameter not much more than half of that usually ascribed to
them : the fact being that, besides the minuteness of the objects into which blood-
corpuscles may divide, the form of the corpuscles is susceptible of every change ; and
minute indeed must he the orifice they could not be made to enter, s0 attenuated is
the shape they sometimes as8ume. It may be also added, that I have observed a
capillary forming, the diameter of which measured only +47", which indeed was
about the size of some of those in fig. 141 : and I have seen objects having precisely
the appearance of hlood-corpuscles, of less than 4/55". Mere points too, are found,
having the red colour of the blood, and we have already seen that minute objects
exhibiting molecular motions, - may be observed within corpuscles of the blood
(par. 128.) ; as well as that young corpuscles of the blood are met with, exhibiting
motions comparable to that called © molecular,” and s0 minute indeed as to have the
appearance of © molecules” enlarged (par. 126.),
