Nearly the whole of these ova produced embryos, there
being only nine out of the one hundred and thirty that were abortive. I have 8ome-
times found a much larger proportional number of unproductive ova in some broods
in the natural haunts of the Frog. There was one exceedingly interesting fact in this experiment,â€”it was that the
smaller and apparently less matured ova were as fully impregnated as the larger and
more perfect. The whole set of observations was the more interesting from this cir-
cumstance. These ova were smaller than usual and had not the white surface s0 com-
plete, but were very like the ova in which I have described the changes in the light-
coloured surface (p. 185).
