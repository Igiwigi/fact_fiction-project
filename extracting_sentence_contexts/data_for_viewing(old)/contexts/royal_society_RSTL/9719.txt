usually happens at the opposite terminal of the tube. This passage through the ty
is not instantaneous, though it is extremely rapid ; and the portion of the tube 5
advance of the discharge is in a state of electric emptiness (or approximately 80) y
that behind the discharge is filled with the free electricity of the dischargeâ€”the di
charge spreading out like a pair of lazy tongs and not passing through the tubes in
compact form like a bullet.

The question of the nature and formation of striz will not here be again discusged
for, in addition to the fact that the explanations given in the previous paper exh
the snbject 80 far as the authors are at present able to deal with it, the high vs
with which we shall chiefly have to do are nob suited to the production of striat ed
discharges. The ideas of positive luminosity and negative dark space will, however,
just as important in this investigation as in the former one, for they are the funda-
mental elements of all vacuum discharges.

It will be observed that we adhere throughout to the language of the two-fluid
theory of electricity. This is done because it not only suffices for our purposes, but
is the one that is most naturally suggested by the phenomena. But it must be borne.
in mind that this is by choice, and for the purposes of clearness and convenience only,
and not as expressing any scientifie conelusion as to the theory which ought to |
