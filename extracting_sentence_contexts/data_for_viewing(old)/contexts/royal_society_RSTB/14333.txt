6. Conclusion

A prime candidate for an evolutionarily conserved EEM in
chelicerates is the dorsal field, which is present in Araneae,
Opiliones, Amblypygi and Uropygi. In addition, the exten-
sive dorsal tissue in Acari might correspond to the dorsal
field of the other groups, but its origin (without the influence
of the cumulus?) and its fate are unclear. The dorsal field
is morphologically separated from the germ band proper,
and it does not seem to contribute to the actual body of the
animal, but instead it merely ‘covers the open dorsal side’
of the developing germ band. In fact, the location and appar-
ent fate of the dorsal field is strikingly similar to the
amnioserosa of higher flies such as D. melanogaster: both tis-
sues stretch towards dorsal, starting from the rim of
the germ band, both tissues cover the ‘open’ dorsal side
of the animal before dorsal closure and both tissues are
apparently gone when dorsal closure is complete. If not hom-
ology, this at least suggests the analogy of dorsal field and
amnioserosa, and indeed the dorsal field is usually labelled
as ‘extraembryonic ectoderm’ in the literature. It is surprising
therefore, that data on cell lineage, tissue fate and gene
expression of srp and hnf-4 instead point to an endodermal
nature of the dorsal field.
