for the reciprocal values of the conducting-powers of bodies are their resistances. The
formula (2) expresses the fact that the absolute difference between 0* C. and 100* C. in

the resistance of an alloy is equal to the absolute difference between 0* C. and 100* C. in
the calculated resistance of the alloy.

The formula (2) may be written

Hen law =le=Yps. ow br hte eaxtn(e)

which is equal to saying that the absolute difference in the observed and calculated resist-
ances at 100* C. is equal to the absolute difference between the observed and calculated
resistances at 0* C. "Tables XIV., XV., and XVI. contain examples of these deductions
taken from the three groups of alloys, taking the resistance of silver at 0* equal to 100.
