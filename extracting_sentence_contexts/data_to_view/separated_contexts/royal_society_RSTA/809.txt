Since |7| increases as ¢ and A decrease, the initial parts of the curves in fig. 8 get
steeper as the wave-length is decreased, and the over land curves are much steeper than
the over sea ones. This is equivalent to the fact that the ground attenuation due to earth
losses increases rapidly with decreasing ¢ and A.

By using the reciprocal theorem the analysis applies as well to the case when the
receiver is on the ground and the transmitter is elevated. By combining both cases the
effect of having both the transmitter and receiver elevated can be calculated. If hy
and h, are the heights of the transmitter and receiver respectively above the ground,
then the signal strength at the receiver is obtained by adding to the value worked out
with both assumed on the ground, the gain reckoned from the ground up to hp, plus the
gain reckoned from the ground up to /;.
