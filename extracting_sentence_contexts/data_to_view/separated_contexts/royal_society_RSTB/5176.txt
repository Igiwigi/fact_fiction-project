Reconstruction. No really satisfactory picture of the habit of a plant can be formed without some
acquaintance with the foliage. But with the facts at our disposal it is none the less
worth while to attempt such a reconstruction. We have seen that the false stem was probably of large diameter and that it stood
erect. The formation of such a composite stem, with a peripheral zone consisting of
petioles and roots, would enable the individual leaf-bearing stems to attain a much
greater height than they could have done had they stood independently.
