ascertaining of the nature and depth of the entire amount of Nile sediment in any sec-
tion of the valley. It is a well-authenticated fact, that no wells can be sunk with any
certainty as to the depth at which water will be found, in any part of the valley, even
within a comparatively limited space. 'This irregularity in the levels must be caused to
= great extent by differences in the degrees of permeability and power of retention in
D the soils; but it will be seen, on examining the sections in the instances quoted above,
Z that the oils of the different pits are very much of the same Kind, and it is not very
S likely that there would be great changes in the intervening spaces.

THE RATE OF SECULAR INCREASE OF THE ALLUVIAL LAND.

I shall now proceed to consider the geological conclusions which appear to me to be
= fairly deducible from the facts which these researches have disclosed, with reference to
the object for which they were undertaken, viz. to endeayour, by digging deep into the
s0il at, appropriate places, to ascertain how nearly we can determine the rate of secular
increase of the alluvial land by the sediment left upon it annually by the. inundation,
and thence to form a probable estimate of the time that has elapsed since the lowest
part of the sediment to which we could reach was deposited. But before entering upon
this part of my memoir, it is necessary that I should draw attention to the inquiries of
a similar nature which were instituted by the French Engineers who accompanied the
expedition under General BoxXAPARTE at the close of the last century, as recorded in the
celebrated work, the © DEsCRIPTION DE LEGYPTE.”

In books that have appeared since the publication of that great work in 1809, when
the formation of the alluvial land of Egypt is referred to, it is generally assumed as a
