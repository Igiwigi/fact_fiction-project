L., R. 13, fig. 34), and the small arrested specimens, on the other hand,
contain no pollen. Nevertheless these young seeds were already provided with pollen-chambers of full
size and mature appearance, whilst the orifice, also, projected well beyond the canopy
(phot. 2 and fig. 24, p.c’.). These facts are consistent with the view that pollen was received by the seed
while it was still fairly small; as soon, perhaps, as the unfolding of the cupule at the
apex permitted. Nevertheless we hardly possess sufticient data for arriving at a
decision as to the time of pollination. The little seeds seem ready for the pollen, but
only full-sized specimens are known to contain pollen in the pollen-chambers.
