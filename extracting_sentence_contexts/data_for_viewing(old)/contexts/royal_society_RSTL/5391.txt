At 1" 4" the bodies were still moving, though the greater number were folded ap
both in the chamber and on the yelk, but some had their tails projecting ont of the
yelk membrane; the chamber had attained to half of its future dimensions.

At 1: 22” all motion had ceased, and there was a heaving of the yelk. From this
period till segmentation began, the spermatozoa in the chamber became gradually
fainter, till they appeared to change into fine elementary granules, and then disap-
peared ; but some of those that entered the dark surface of the yelk remained for more
than twenty minutes after its first cleavage, whilst others that were sticking in the
vitelline membrane were perceptible for many hours.

In the glass box were three other eggs, in all of which the same facts could be
noted. The segmentation of the yelk began at the end of three hours and thirty

minutes at the temperature stated. I may mention, that in each egg two spherical
bodies, to be presently described, were present, and that these exist in all perfectly or
imperfectly fecundated eggs.

"The observations were repeated on the evening of the same day on a et of four
eggs; and were repeated on the three following days with precisely similar results.

Second set of observations—I now proposed to vary the conditions of the eggs
by having a temperature of the room of 64* FauR., there being the corresponding
