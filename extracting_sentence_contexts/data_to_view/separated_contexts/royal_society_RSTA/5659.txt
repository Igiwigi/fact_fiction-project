In three
dimensions, we find (using equations (3.13b) and (3.18b)) the Bolgiano-Obukhov result explicitly
as

It remains to provide an estimate of the quantities f(¢, 7) and g(¢, «) in D=3 and for y=4,

which is a consequence of the self-consistency of equations (3.132) and (3.182). For this, we use a

trick for evaluating integrals [39] in dynamics from a renormalization group standpoint. This

involves exploiting the fact that we are interested in wavenumbers ‘k’ that are much smaller

than the viscous dissipation scale and hence evaluate the integrals to the lowest order in k’. Accordingly, equation (3.12) simplifies to

To evaluate the integral in equation (3.16), it is simplest to write it in frequency space and carry
out the frequency integration to get in three dimensions

Here, again, we employ the same approximation as before of evaluating the integral F(p) where
the wavenumber p is small (upper bounded by k which is small) and use a large —q limit to extract
the first non-vanishing term in p. Accordingly, we find (setting y=4 and 5z=2) after doing an
angular average

Returning to equation (3.17) in D =3, we find that the integration produces a term In(k/ko),
which diverges as the lower cut off is taken towards zero.
