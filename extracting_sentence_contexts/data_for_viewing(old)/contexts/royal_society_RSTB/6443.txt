are formed and generally, at least, in the organs associated with reproduction.

In mammals oestrus-producing substances of different chemical composition,
besides being obtained from the ovaries, have been extracted from the placenta, the
blood, and (in women, mares, sows, and cows) from the urine, more particularly from
the urine of pregnancy, but, as demonstrated by ZonpEK (1934), the richest known
source is the urine of the stallion. It is to be noted that oestrins are not normally
obtainable from any source in the body after the extirpation of the gonads excepting
from animals with retained placenta. After the placenta is removed none of these
substances is to be found. Similarly, the formation of the male hormones is
apparently confined to the testes, but, as in the female, there are several naturally
produced substances which can be made to cause the sexual phenomena. In view of
all these facts it is apparent, as Dopps has pointed out (1935, a, B), that the hormone-
producing mechanisms are not very specific in their demands for a chemical excitant,
and it is all the more remarkable that the body should, so to speak, go to such trouble
to produce the particular active substances which are believed to be responsible for
the respective sexual processes of the male and female. At present the most reason-
able way of regarding the matter is to suppose that the sexual hormones were
originally derivatives from the sterols which are widely distributed in living tissues,
that the hormones at first had no particular physiological significance, but that in the
course of evolutionary progress the parts of the body concerned, the uterus and the
vagina and the male accessory sexual glands as well as the secondary sexual structures,
have developed the capacity to respond to the chemical substances which have thus
acquired the character of specific hormones in the manner originally postulated by
Srar.inG (1935). The mechanism in this respect is, in fact, comparable to that of
