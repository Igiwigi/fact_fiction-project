In the present investigation it was always found possible to
insert the hand from the cavity of the vagina, when that organ was cut across in sztu, into
that of the urogenital canal. There is therefore no reason to suppose that the vagina is not
normally used in copulation in the elephant. As for the comparison with the hyena in this
particular respect, which was taken up by Neuville, a later paper by Matthews (1939) has
made it clear that the vagina of the hyena is in fact distinguishable from the uterus, both
morphologically and histologically, and that here again there is no reason to suppose it is
not functional in coitus.

(2) The development of the ovarial sac

The structure of the ovarial sac of the adult elephant has been briefly described above
(p. 112, figure 5). The most comprehensive account of the comparative morphology of the
peritoneal structures in the region of the ovary of mammals is that of Zuckerkandl (1897),
who showed that the form of the sac varies within each order of mammals, while in some
cases the same form of sac appears in members of several different orders. In general, the
ovarial sac is formed by the mesosalpinx, or ala vespertilionis.
