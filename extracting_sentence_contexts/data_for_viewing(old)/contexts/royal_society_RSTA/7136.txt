G = 3x 108Lb./in2

The compressibility of the web, assuming the stress to vary linearly to zero at the neutral
axis, is 4:5 x 107° in./Lb./in.; the rivets are 3% in. snap head at 4 in. pitch, giving a coefficient
of slip of 3 x 107° in./Lb./in. (Parkes 1947), whence k = 133000 Lb./in.? and K = 0:96.

Substituting in equation (145) we get

M,, = 13800 Lb.in. (148)
By modifying the analysis of part II of the present paper to take account of rivet slip we find
that for flange loading M,, = 18300 Lb.in. (149)

The discrepancy between equations (148) and (149) is almost entirely due to the fact
that Winny’s analysis leads to a distribution of load between flanges and web which is
dependent on the geometry of the section. The proportion of load carried by the web in-
creases with increase of the coefficient of rivet slip and, as may be seen from equation (145),
M,, decreases. For the case when load is applied entirely to the flanges, we do not find this
to be so; according to our analysis M,, increases with increase of rivet slip.
