2Strictly speaking, a pressure tensor should be defined in terms of the velocity fluctuations w;1;, but this would unduly
complicate the notation. Thus, we stick to the above definition of Tj. while still using the term ‘pressure’ for this quantity.



As is always the case for hydrodynamic models, some further hypotheses are needed to close Ee
the above set of equations (5.6)-(5.10). A particularly interesting strategy, based on the maximum
entropy method (MEP), was used in a previous work [31] to close the set of hydrodynamic 3
equations in the presence of the sole Zeeman interaction. Unfortunately, when one adds the spin— 1B
orbit interaction, the MEP does not provide any conclusive analytical results (the difficulty arises
from the fact that the spin-orbit interaction couples all the components of the velocity). However,
an intuitive closure can be found by inspecting the evolution equation (5.10) for the pressure
tensor. There, most spin-dependent terms cancel if we set

The physical interpretation of the above equations is that the spin of a particle is simply

to neglecting some spin-velocity correlations [27]. With this assumption, equation (5.9) and : =
