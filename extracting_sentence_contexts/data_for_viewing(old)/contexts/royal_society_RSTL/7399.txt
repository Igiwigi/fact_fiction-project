abject replete with interest, T have not had sufficient time at my disposal to undertake it.
| All are agreed, however, as to the direct method of deyelopment, by which the entire

zrted into the form of the future animal, either without, or whilst still enclosed within
1e body of its parent. Further than this, however, almost nothing is known concerning
1e after stages of development in which, by the development and differentiation of its
xtarnal organs, it attains to the typical form of its species; and this may be accounted
TX in a measure by the fact that, with one recent exception only, the complete and
atire life-history of no other parasitic Nematoid has been fully revealed*. A gap remains
he history of most between the period of their emergence from the egg, and the time
hen they are uſually met with as sexually mature individuals within the bodies of their
zJous hosts. Whether during this intervening period they are to be met with in other
Zmary intermediate hosts, in a non-sexual condition, 8uch as we are familiar with in
vEhing 8piralis and the species included under the name of Filaria piscium, or whether
uzing the course of their existence they are, as a rule, parasitic only within a single
