value method was not given. I have recently supplied such a proof, extending the
problem to include a heterogeneous liquid. A
But when the method is applied to some other problems, the situation is not so

satisfactory. Among the results to which Raytercut was led is the following. If
an inviscid liquid flows between parallel planes, the motion is stable if up| dy®
retains the same sign throughout the liquid, u, being the velocity in the steady motion
and _» the distance from one of the planes. This result is deduced from the fact that
the characteristic values of a parameter in a certain differential equation cannot be
complex, the implication being that they are therefore real. RaAyiercH$ further
claimed that the method established the stability of a uniform shearing motion, for
which d?u,/dy? = 0. Ketvin|| and Love § criticized the method, and a review of the
situation in 1907 was given by Orr.** In spite of the fact that its general validity
remains obscure, the characteristic-value method has been widely employed.{{ It
is not the purpose of the present paper to attempt to justify or to discredit the
characteristic-value method in general. The paper deals only with the simplest
of all stability problems, that of an inviscid liquid flowing between fixed parallel

planes. In §2 the method is discussed in some detail and in §3 an argument is

developed to show that RAyLrrGcu’s criterion for stability, mentioned above, cannot

be legitimately deduced by his method. He proved that complex characteristic
values are impossible, and I now prove that real characteristic values are also
impossible. The conclusion to be drawn is that the characteristic-value method is
