represent a finite approximation to a Young measure concentrated there, and specifically toa PDF
or CDF. A systematic test of these ideas is given in [17], where convergence norms are applied to
the PDFs and CDFs. First, the differences (as the mesh is changed) in the PDF /CDF is measured by
an L; norm of the difference. These norm differences, one for each supercell, are compared (in Ly
or Lo), to give an overall norm of the difference of PDF/CDF. We find convergence or converging
trends under mesh refinement, with the order of convergence depending on the supercell size.
From this fact, we conclude that the primary error is related to the statistical sample size as an
approximation to the PDF/CDE, rather than being mesh related. These facts are illustrated with a
table extracted from Kaman et al. [17] (table 1).

5. An application programming interface for front tracking

Having argued that FT/LES/SGS has desirable properties for the study of turbulent mixing, we
turn to the question of the availability of this technology to others. Here, we address three issues:
the application programming interface (API), a conservative version of the API and a graceful
end to the tracking of the interface in overly complex frontal topologies.

Before going into the details, we describe the front or interface software, a product of Jiao
and students [21-23], and replacing our older interface software. Conceptually the ideas are
simple. A front is presented as an unstructured triangulation of a smooth surface (folds and
