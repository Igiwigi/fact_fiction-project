long an interval before it be brought to rest as it did to acquire its momentum, the
relative inclinations at the beginning and end being about the same.

The reversal of the stream throughout the strait at the same time will not therefore
be a matter of surprise, as it will be seen to be only the effect of gravitation due to
the general slope of the surface. That it is the general slope of the surface of the
combined wave that occasions the stream throughout these channels, is even more
manifest in the North Sea than in the English Channel, from the fact of the stream
there pursuing a steady course between two shores, of which the order of their
tidal establishments is inverted without reference to either.
