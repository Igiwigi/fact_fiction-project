If, in one population, variation in a marker tends to be correlated with that of a particular gene (i.e. the
marker and gene are in LD), but in another population LD is lower, a PRS developed using the first population will not be as
predictive in the second. Point (vi) simply notes the possibility of random errors; while this concern is considerable in GWAS, it is generally thought that
markers found to be associated at the standard, very strong, statistical significance levels are unlikely to be spurious. The same
cannot be said of the weaker associations used in PRS, many of which are in fact likely to be mis-estimated or entirely spurious. Note that more than one of these problems may occur in any particular GWAS and that these different issues can interact
in potentially complex ways. More recently, Mathieson [66] has suggested that the ‘omnigenic model’ (in which many loci contribute indirectly to
variation in many traits) can explain the failure of polygenic scores developed in one population to be predictive in
others; he argues further that since PRS likely rely so heavily on loci with only indirect relationships to the trait in question,
we should not expect them to be ‘robust clinical targets’.
