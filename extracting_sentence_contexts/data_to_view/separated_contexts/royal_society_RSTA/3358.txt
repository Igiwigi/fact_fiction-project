352 LORD RAYLEIGH ON THE COMPRESSIBILITY OF GASES

The deviations from unity in the cases of oxygen and argon were thought to exceed
the errors of observation. The results presently to be given for oxygen render it
probable that the larger half of the deviation was, in fact, error. At any rate,
Boy.r's law was sensibly observed by air, hydrogen and carbonic oxide. The method employed in this research appeared to be satisfactory, and I was
desirous of extending it to higher pressures, still, however, below the atmospheric, as
to which there seemed to be a great dearth of information, I could find only some
incidental observations by AmAGat* on air and carbonic acid, and these it may be
well to quote :â€”
