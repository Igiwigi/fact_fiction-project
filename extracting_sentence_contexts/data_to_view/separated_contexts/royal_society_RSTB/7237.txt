Though it must be admitted at the outset that it
yields but little information concerning the mechanisms by which the various sectors of the
postural ring are selected for action, the more general significance of the pattern should not
be overlooked. The radial and circumferential fibres are, in the first place, the only
systems of oriented tracts to be found within the bulb complex, a circumstance suggesting
that the postural muscles are subject to a more precise regional grouping of contraction than
are the retractor muscles which are served through a diffuse system of internuncials and
which are known to act as a single contractional unit. Secondly, the radial distribution of
the fibres linking the bulb complex with the terminal elements of the postural muscle
innervation is, in its general features, fully consistent with the sectorial contraction of the
postural musculature and is in fact a requirement of the hypothetical scheme of innervation
that had been put forward (Smith 1945) as a possible explanation of the observed patterns
of orientation of the feet. The ring fibres, on the other hand, introduce a new and somewhat
unexpected element into the innervation, the functional implications of which may become
more apparent on further study of the oriented movements of the podia. A possible role is,
however, suggested by the ease with which centrally controlled movements of the feet can
be made to yield to other patterns under the influence of particular patterns of peripheral
stimulation.
