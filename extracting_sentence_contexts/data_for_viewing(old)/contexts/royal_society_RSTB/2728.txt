neighbourhood of the injury, with the result that the conidia of other “ biologic
forms” are now able to infect them, since they no longer meet with any special
substance able to injure them,

I would point out here that the present experiments furnish conclusive and direct
proof that, as regards the Mrysiphacee, the immunity of a certain host-species
against the attacks of other “ biologic forms” than its own in no way depends on
any anatomical or structural peculiarities—such as hairs, ribs, thickness of the cell-
wall or cuticle, or the chemical nature of the cell-wall, &e.—since in the experiments
where a “cut” leaf became susceptible to a “ biologic form” otherwise incapable of
infecting it, the conidia were sown on the uninjured epidermis of the leaf.

It seems to me possible also that we may find in the facts shown by the above
experiments the explanation of a phenomenon which so frequently confronts plant-

pathologists, viz., the sudden appearance of a parasitic fungus disease on plants which
had hitherto proved immune. As the above experiments prove, it needs only an
injury to be made to the leaves of certain plants in order to render them susceptible
to disease, although otherwise they remain immune; and since, as experiments
further proved, when the fungus has gained a footing on the injured parts, it can at
