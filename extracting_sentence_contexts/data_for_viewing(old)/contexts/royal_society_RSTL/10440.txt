development in different parts of the egg, will not, however, account for some of the
forms of unequal segmentation in Zenilla. When, for instance, the egg divides into
four larger and four smaller 8pheres, the former do not contain a greater number of
nuclei than the latter, since at the following cleavage all are divided alike into two
parts, and further, we have seen that the inequality existing at firs may be
considerably reduced without the occurrence of any visible cleavage. It is improbable
that the canse is simply a lack of precision in the action of the vitellus, since the
arrangement of the spheres is constant, 80 far as observed, the larger spheres being at
one pole of the egg and the smaller spheres at the other. The resemblance of the egg
ab this stage to an epibolic gastrula has already been noted, and the idea naturally
Ruggests itself that this regemblance may be due, nob to accident, but to actual
Nreversion of the gastrula form, though the essential features of the development are
entirely different from those of the gastrula. There are a number of facts which
Sindicate the derivation of the delaminate planula from an epibolic gastrula like that of
SPuarxes; and if the planula has had such an origin, it is not improbable tha it might
Deeasionally revert to the original unequal form of segmentation.

At the elose of segmentation the embryo is roughly spherical in form, varying
