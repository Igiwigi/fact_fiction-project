pressure slightly above atmospheric. Then the current was discontinued, the tap P
cautiously opened, and the gas allowed to escape, first through mercury contained in
the tube M and then through solid potassium hydrate. Any gas other than chlorine
was then sucked out by the automatic pump, which, during the first part of the
electrolysis, was kept constantly working.

The operation of filling the apparatus with chlorine and exhausting was repeated
four times. The gas from the first two fillings was not completely absorbed. In
preparing chlorine for our determinations we filled the apparatus five times, and tested
the fifth by fusing-off the side tube K and opening it under mercury. The absorption
was so complete as to leave no visible gas residue. This test assured us that no air
was left in our chlorine. The fact that the chlorine first evolved was allowed to
escape was a safeguard against the possible presence of bromine or iodine, for any
bromide in the silver chloride would have been decomposed by the chlorine, and the
evolved bromine would have been carried over with the chlorine first escaping.

The chlorine bulb (immersed in a cooling mixture of solid carbonic acid and ether
contained in a silvered Dewar tube) was then filled with liquid chlorine. The current
was increased and the condensation allowed to proceed until the liquid reached the
level of a circular line etched on the bulb, when the current was stopped. About
37 grammes of liquid chlorine were collected in each experiment. Finally the
chlorine bulb was separated by fusion.

Irregularities, arising in the electrolytic cell, were shown by an ammeter placed
