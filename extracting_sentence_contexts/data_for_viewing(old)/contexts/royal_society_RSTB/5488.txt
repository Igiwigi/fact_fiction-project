is intelligible as an expression of a wide-spread tendency among ferns to acquire a
C-shaped leaf-trace (@wyNNE-VAUGHAN and Krpsron). But the temporary appearance
of this feature in a Zygopterid fern (e.g., Asterochlenopsis) where subsequently the
adaxial xylem attains the same development as the abaxial, is of particular interest
as a case of recapitulation. For it shows the development of an organ making a detour
in its course, which can only be explained on the analogy of erratic behaviour in conscious
beings under the influence of habit or memory.

Both on the strength of these resemblances and of the less striking ones in the stem
stele, which have already been pointed out, the origin of the Zygopteridew as a side line of
evolution from the base of the main Osmundaceous stock seems a well founded conclusion.

(6) The “ stem of Clepsydropsis.”—The fact that in the Siberian and the Australian
zygopterids petioles of the same Clepsydropsis type have been found attached to stems
of two generically distinct plants reveals a rather interesting situation. It is well
known that the genus Clepsydropsist was founded on fragmentary rachises, presumed
to be those of ferns, but that concerning their parent stem there has been a good deal of
speculation. Prof. Paut Berrranp, who first suggested that the rachises are Zygopte-
ridean,{ once believed that the associated axes named Cladoxylon were the parent
stems in question,§ but he later withdrew this opinion.|| Soon afterwards, when Mrs.
E.M. Osporn {announced the discovery of the Australian Zygopterid, with Clepsydropsis-
like petioles attached to stems having the Ankyropteris grayi type of stele, it seemed as
if the stem of Clepsydropsis had at last been found. Relying solely wpon the similarity
in the foliar bundle, I concluded that UncEr’s Clepsydropsis must have been borne upon
the same kind of stem as the Australian plant ; the latter was accordingly assigned to
