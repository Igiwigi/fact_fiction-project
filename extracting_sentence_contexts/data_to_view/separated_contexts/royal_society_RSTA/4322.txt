From this perspective, : =
the RNA World could be considered as a physico-chemical computational system, one that was : Sy
maintained through the controlled transfer of molecular sequence information. We could speak a
of such a system having an elementary ‘code’—complementary Watson—Crick base pairing—and aed
the information for any function would have been stored in the sequence complementary to the 22
ribozyme that performed that function. In fact, it was the capability of RNA to act simultaneously : Sg
as both an information carrier and a catalyst that led to the RNA World hypothesis, circumventing DNS
the need for complex genetic coding in the earliest autocatalytic systems. However, RNA faces : a
a fundamental limitation in respect of its usefulness for the computational control of chemical : Ss

processes at the sub-nanometre level. A nucleotide base occupies on average about 0.30nm? compared with an average of
about 0.13nm3 for the 20 standard amino acids found in proteins.
