west of Lake Vyrnwy, was enclosed in 1936 and voles reached their first peak in 1940
(Appendix 1c).

Glasgwm, by contrast, had supported voles since at least 1926, and other suitable areas
in the Marchnant valley had also been fenced off about this time. The 1937 peak may
therefore have been their third or fourth. In a new plantation the year in which voles
reach a peak no doubt depends on many factors. The year of enclosure from grazing, type
of vegetation, weather, initial vole numbers and amount of immigration may be expected
to affect the rate of population growth. Therefore only by certain combinations of events
would the first peak in a new area seem likely to coincide with a peak in an old one. It is
therefore not specially remarkable that, with the exception of area E, peak densities in
the new areas did not coincide with those in the older enclosures in the Marchnant valley.
The problem, which was not answered by any facts discovered during this inquiry, is
why peak densities should have been reached simultaneously in 1937 in all the old planta-
tions, and in most of the younger ones in 1938 despite their different years of enclosure.
This question is discussed theoretically in a later section.

3. Bopy WEIGHTS AND REPRODUCTION

The main features of the seasonal changes in population structure of Microtus are known
from Baker & Ranson (1933) and Brambell & Hall (1939). Overwintering populations
consist largely of young of the previous breeding season whose body weight remains low
until spring. There is then an increase in weight, the first young are born in April or May
and breeding may continue until October. Baker & Ranson thought it probable that the _
young did not breed in their first year; but Brambell & Hall showed that some did and
