It may here be mentioned, however, that already at that early period Bovs-
8INGAULT had 80 far adyanced in his inquiries into the chemical statistics of certain agri-
cultural practices on the large scale, as to be apparently led by them to see the import-
ance of inyestigating much more closely the sources of the Nitrogen periodically yielded
by a given area of land, over and aboye that which was artificially supplied to it. We fully admit the pertinence of the considerations, and the sagacity of the observa-
tions adduced on this head, more than twenty years ago, by Bouss1x6AULT. It will,
neyertheless, be well to preface the discussion of our own experimental evidence regard-
Sing the sources of the nitrogen of plants, by the statement of a few prominent and
Striking facts, established by investigations conducted here, at Rothamsted, illustrative
Sf the amounts of nitrogen yielded by different crops over a given area of land, and of
e relation of these amounts to certain measured, or known, sources of it. Of these
Points, however, we profess to speak only in a yery brief and summary manner on the
Zpresent occasion. The discussion in detail, of the evidence relating to them, would
Indeed itself exhaust the limits of our Paper.
