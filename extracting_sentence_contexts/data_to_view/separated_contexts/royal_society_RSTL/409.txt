For this purpose, a double convex lens, of about thirty-
8ix inches focus, was laid on a flat piece of looking-glass plate,
having its under side painted black ; on the lens was placed
another piece of plane glass plate; by these means two sets
of primary rings were produced, whose positions with respect
to each other could be yaried at pleasure. On using the sha-
dow of the black card I was agreeably surprized to find, that
instead of parallel fringes a new species of prismatic rings ap-
peared, whose number and sizes varied with the positions and
distances of the two sets of primaries ; their dimensions were
from two to three times the diameters of the primaries from
which they appeared to originate, sometimes only one set
appeared, sometimes two, and at other times a third very
faintly. On first observing these new rings, it was found, that on
moving the eye in a horizontal direction to the right or left,
they sometimes moved 2th, and sometimes contrary to the
motion of the eye; others were stationary, although the eye
moved; also, that sometimes the prismatic colours were seen
in the usual order, and at other times inverted ; all of which
facts seemed not a little perplexing at that time; but their
causes will be better understood from what follows. Exp. 7. By a subsequent- experiment, it was discovered,
that those rings towards the circumference of the new sets
had their colours. always in the usual order; but that those
nearest the centres had their colours always inverted; that
the number of rings of each class were equal : that they all

sets of rings with each other, from which intersections they
