stable in contact with water or mother liquor at room temperature (ca. 20Â° C) for over
10 weeks whereas that made at low temperatures in the presence of magnesium decomposed
within a day in the same conditions. We find also that the products of decomposition
depend on the conditions which bring about the decomposition of any given sample and
that apparently similar conditions do not always lead to the same results. Vaterite and
calcite were the most frequently met products of decomposition. Aragonite was formed on
one occasion by dropping the hexahydrate into boiling water although the usual product
after this treatment was vaterite.

Discussion

From a chemical standpoint perhaps the most interesting results of the experiments which
have been described spring from the fact that by using suitable conditions it has been found
possible to promote the formation of metastable and unstable phases. By using a range of
conditions all the well-recognized crystalline products of the reaction of calcium chloride
and sodium carbonate have been prepared either as single phases or as mixtures, namely
calcite, aragonite, vaterite, and calcium carbonate hexahydrate, and in addition calcium
carbonate monohydrate and gaylussite. One of the important factors was the choice of
suitable additives. Two substances were used, namely magnesium-ion, which from general
crystal chemical experience can be expected to enter to some extent into the structure of
calcium compounds forming substitutional solid solutions, and Calgon, which we know to
be extensively adsorbed on some surfaces and which can lead to crystal habit modification.

In the case of Calgon it was observed that the appearance of metastable phases was
preceded by a reduction in frequency of nucleation with the stable calcite, which was
