the commonest of the fossil Angiosperms we describe, has also a type of stem
anatomy comparatively rare among living forms. Unfortunately none shows a new
“ Pro-Angiosperm” type of anatomy. But we should like to remark here that it
seems very doubtful if it would be recognisable as such were the stem alone of
a pro-Angiosperm to be forthcoming. After this, if it will not appear too inconsistent,
we should like to add that the presence of Saurwropsis at this early date makes one
pause to consider whether, looked at impartially, anything could be much more
primitive than the anatomy of Sawruropsis, and, indeed, the Saururacee as a whole.
Had botanists not got accustomed to the existence of Sawrurus among living plants
it would surely have attracted the anatomists’ attention, It has no large vessels, no
differentiation of the wood into vessels and fibres. Its metaxylem elements are
exclusively scalariform. No phylogenetic views are here expressed : we wish merely
to note the fact, brought to our notice by the discovery of the fossil Saururopsis,
that the Saururacean anatomy is of an extraordinarily suggestive description.

Among the Angiosperms there is but one that seems to belong to the Mono-
cotyledons, the flower Cretovarium. This, curiously enough, is .comparatively
abundant. The details of its structure are given on p. 70, with the reasons for the,
possibly temporary, placing of it in the Liliacese not very far from Aletris, a rather
exceptional genus with the carpels partly inferior and fused to the perianth. In any
case, the structure of this, the first known flower, does nothing to support the recent
theories of flower origin, for it is itself apparently so far advanced already as to
give no clue to its phylogeny. t

Taking the Angiosperms as a whole, there is one Monocotyledon, and five
