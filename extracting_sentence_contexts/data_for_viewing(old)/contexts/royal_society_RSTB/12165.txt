the observation of apparent cooperative bacterial behaviour
was merely considered a biological curiosity, no more than
that. However, beginning in the 1990s it became apparent
that bacterial cooperation is a much more widespread occur-
rence. The discovery of multiple examples of this
phenomenon gave rise to a new field: sociomicrobiology
(reviewed in [75]; a less technical exploration of sociomicro-
biology is included in [76, pp. 156-161]). This discipline
was created in great part in response to the recognition of
the phenomenon of quorum sensing, which describes bac-
terial communication phenomena that seem to be related to
the pathogenic nature of many bacterial species (reviewed
in [77,78]). This fact has many public health implications.
Quorum sensing disruption is currently investigated as a
possible target to develop new classes of antibiotics [79,80].
Remarkably, recent developments indicate that bacterial com-
munities rely on electrochemical processes for communication
purposes, just as nerve cells do [81-83]. Moreover, one of the
most exciting developments in this area is the discovery that
bacteria can communicate with each other via ion channels,
in a manner quite similar to how nerve cells communicate
[83]. Surprisingly, this kind of communication can occur
between different bacterial species [81,82].
