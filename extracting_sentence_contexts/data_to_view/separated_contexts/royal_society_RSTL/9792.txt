When,
however, the strength of the impulses is diminished either by clamping or by the
action of heat upon the motor ganglia, this due relation is destroyed and the ventricle
either beats synchronously with every s8econd, third, or more contractions of the
auricles or else does not beat at all. If under these cireumstances the excitability of
the ventricular muscle be increased, then the relation between the strength of the
impulses and the muscular excitability, which is necessary for synchronous contractions,
Q will be restored, either fully or partially, according to the extent to which the
A excitability is raised. On the other hand, if the excitability be lowered then that due
S relation will be till further destroyed, and each beat of the ventricle will follow upon
= a «till larger number of auricular beats than before.

& In accordance with this method of testing the excitability, experiment proves that
> the vagus may canse a diminution of the excitability of the ventricle during the first
© part of its action, during, therefore, the period when it is known to diminish the force
.& of the contractions ; and may cause an increase of excitability when it augments the
'Z force of the contractions.

= T will now proceed to give the facts upon which the trath of this proposition
[8 depends, and will first examine the action of the nerve when the clamp in the auriculo-
3 ventricular groove is tightened 80 as to make the ventricle beat synchronously with
<= every second or third beat of the auricles. Z In this case the most striking effect of stimulation of the nerve is the alteration
S which is produced in the rate of the ventricular rhythm rather than the variations in
£ the force of the ventricular contractions. It is true that the nerve stimulation may
= $till cause the force of the ventricular contractions to be diminished and augmented
= in the same way as already described, but neither the diminution nor the augmentation
D are 80 manifest as when the ventricle is beating synchronously with every auricular
S beab; this is doubtless Jargely owing to the greater 8ize of the ventricular contractions
E in consequence of their slower rate of rhythm.
