1. Consciousness and its neural basis

Consciousness is often described as a mystery because there are no clear expla-
natory links connecting it to material processes, and thus accounting for

access consciousness, cognitive access subjective conscious experiences in terms of certain features of ‘underlying’
brain states and neural interactions appears to be an intractable problem for
Author for correspondence: scientific endeavours [1]. The problem stems from the fact that the phenomenal

aspect of consciousness seems to be dissociable from its purported functional
aspects. As Ned Block famously argues, the notion of phenomenal consciousness
(referring to the experiential characteristics of consciousness) is conceptually
distinct from the notion of access consciousness (referring to the functions that
can be associated with consciousness) [2]. Consequently, functional descrip-
tions of proclaimed neural bases of consciousness can always be seen as
descriptions of the mere information processing and representational capacities
of certain brain states, while it can be denied that the brain states in question
correspond to consciousness in any way.
