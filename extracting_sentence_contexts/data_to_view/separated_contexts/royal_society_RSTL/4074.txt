See Ny 53. 64. 65,

In the Ass (Ã¾ 53) the four lower fasciculi of the serratus posticus inferior are in-
spiratory, the two upper expiratory, and the two intermediate neutral. In the Dog
($ 64) all the fasciculi are expiratory, while in the Rabbit (F 65) they are all inspi-
ratory. From the direction of the fibres, and from the fact that the fibres are shorter
when the lungs are flaccid than when they are distended, I infer that in Man the
serratus posticus inferior is expiratory.

89. Inspiratory muscles, ordinary respiration. I have observed the following muscles to be inspiratory.
