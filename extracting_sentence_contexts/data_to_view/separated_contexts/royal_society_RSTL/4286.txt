To this question I may reply, they
have shown us, that at least 60 inches more rain is deposited in England than we
were previously aware of; that 150 inches sometimes descends in the Lake District
in a year, more than falls in most parts of the tropics with which we are acquainted,
and sufficient to drown standing, two of the tallest men in Great Britain, one on the
top of the other. They have further informed us, that 64 perpendicular inches of
water is sometimes precipitated from the atmosphere in twenty-four hours, and 10
inches in forty-eight hours, a quantity which would be thought large for any two
consecutive months in most parts of England. We have further ascertained that the
almost incredible depth of 30 inches occasionally descends in a single month ; a
fall nearly equal to the calculated average for all other parts of England in a year*,
The experiments have, in short, enabled us to collect a number of new and curious
facts, bearing on the quantity and very unequal distribution of rain in this island. We have also ascertained, with a high degree of probability, the law of the gradation
in the amount of rain, at various intermediate points, between the valleys and the
tops of our highest mountains. A little consideration will greatly lessen our surprise at the enormous quantities
of water deposited in the hilly districts of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and at
the consequent unequal distribution of rain in the climate of Great Britain.
