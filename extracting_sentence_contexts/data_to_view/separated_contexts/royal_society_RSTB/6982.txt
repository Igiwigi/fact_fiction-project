I. INTRODUCTION

Marked differences in the degrees of development of the reproductive systems of starlings
(Sturnus vulgaris L.) present in the British Isles in autumn and winter were first noticed by
Rowan (1937, 1938). He found that the gonads of London birds in February were con-
siderably larger than those of similar birds taken in the country at the same time, and he
interpreted this fact as indicating that the disturbance due to the lights and traffic of the
town caused a precocious development of the gonads of those birds which were nightly
subjected to it. This conclusion was immediately criticized by reviewers (Ibis, ser. 14, 2,
787) on the grounds that other interpretations could also be made to fit the facts, and
indeed Bissonnette (1931) had already shown experimentally that it is impossible to induce
precocious sexual development in the starling by means of nightly disturbance alone. Investigations preliminary to those recorded here were made (Bullough & Carrick 1939,
1940), and these suggested that the starlings taken by Rowan in London were of-a British
race whereas, by chance, those taken in the country were winter immigrants from the
continent of Europe. Although it is not possible to distinguish the British from the Conti-
nental bird by any constant external morphological feature, it was suggested that it would
be necessary, if the results were substantiated, to consider these two types of birds as
subspecifically distinct.
