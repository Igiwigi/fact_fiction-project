pressure, even though experimentally he could not fully approach the critical temperature
(1751 K) and pressure (1673 bar) at that time.

Such a metal to non-metal transition at finite temperature, in fact, raises fundamental questions
of definition of both of these canonical states of matter [7]. As Landau & Zeldovich [11]
and Mott (e.g. [12]) pointed out, there is a fundamental difficulty—theoretically and indeed
experimentally—in drawing a distinction between a metal and a non-metal except at the absolute
zero of temperature [7]. We now recognize that, at the absolute zero of temperature, a metal sharply
and fundamentally differs from a non-metal with respect to its accessible spectrum of electronic
energy levels.

The ground state of a metal comprises a continuous spectrum of electronic energy states.
This explains the striking fact that in a metal the application of even the weakest electrical field
produces an electrical current due to transitions to adjacent electronic levels in the continuum
of electronic energy states. By contrast, the energy spectrum of a dielectric, i.e. a non-metal, is
characterized by the existence of a finite electronic energy gap between levels. Thus, a rigorous
criterion to distinguish between a metal and a non-metal can exist only at T=O0K. There... ’....
a metal conducts and a nonmetal doesn’t’ [13]. At any non-zero temperature, therefore, thermal
excitation of conduction electrons, no matter how few, blurs the difference between metal and
non-metal.

The most common modern—that is, quantum mechanical—description of metals and non-
metals is that metals contain a partially filled conduction band, whereas non-metals have a
completely filled valence band separated by a large electronic energy gap from an empty
conduction band. The modern theory of electronic band structure provides a comprehensive
