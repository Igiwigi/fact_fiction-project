(i) T(t) can be extended to an analytic contraction semigroup on the sector 6,
(ii) If T(t) can be extended to an analytic semigroup on the sector Xy for some 6’ € (0, 5] then
< 4p, i.e. the angle 6, is optimal.

In the self-adjoint case, we obtain « =0, hence cot 62 =0 and cot 6p = (|p — 2))/(2\/p — 1). It is
worth noticing that the angle is independent of the dimension and in fact the same result holds
in the infinite dimensional case as well.

The asymptotic behaviour of T(t) in ub follows from the previous considerations and the
spectral results of §4b. It is clear, in fact, that T(t)f > Pf pointwise for f € C,(RN), where Pf
is the projection defined by the right-hand side of (3.12). By Lebesgue theorem, we obtain
limy +00 I T(DF — PFilne =0 for every f € C,(RN) and then by density for all functions f € Ly. On
the other hand, 0 is an eigenvalue of A, for p > 1, the other eigenvalues have negative real parts
and the semigroup is analytic (and also compact), see §4b. All together, this implies that T(t)
converges to the projection P exponentially as t > oo in the operator norm.

Let us show how L/ estimates for the associated parabolic problems follow from the above
properties, by general theorems. We recall that an analytic semigroup S(-) on a Banach space
