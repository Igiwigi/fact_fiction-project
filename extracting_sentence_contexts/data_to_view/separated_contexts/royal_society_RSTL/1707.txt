The little
eddy which plays around them from the motion of the tides and waves, will,
when the hell is raised from the rock, bring any floating fragments within

anatomy, and it is proved by obseryation. Some time since, Mr. DiLiwyx and
myself, dissecting some specimens, found in the stomach of one of them a por-
tion of a fucus s0 large, that he was enabled at once to recognise it as F. pin-
natifidus; and in a recent communication he informs me that he has found
fragments of Ulva linza in the stomachs of others.
