These, I take it, are suspended in life in an extremely fluid substance, protoplasm or
plasma, by the aid of which the transportation of nutritive material or the removal of
waste matters can be managed through considerable lengths of these tubular fibres.
It is therefore possible that each efferent fibre is the morphological equivalent of a
a considerable number of afferent fibres, each one of the latter being, without doubt, a
®% single axis cylinder.
2 Be this as it may, it is, at any rate, abundantly clear that the disposition of the
5 nerve cells on the surface of the dense nervous tissue of the ganglion, and their rela-
& tion to the blood streams, lends no support to the idea that they are nourished, even in
S part, by their processes. The distinction of the processes of nerve cells into “ nutritive
§ processes” and true nerve or axis-cylinder processes has been advocated by Nansent
we for the Crustacea, and by Goxer for Vertebrates. In the latter case the distinction is
ED cn based upon histological facts which appear to me to be adequately explained by the effect
2 of the shrinkage of the tissue in occluding the ly mph lacunze which, we must suppose,
‘5 surround the nerve cells of the central nervous system and their processes during life.

THE POST-GiSOPHAGEAL NERVE CORD OF THE CRUSTACHA. 101

3 Arrangement of the Nervous Elements of the Ganglion.

& These consist of cells, fibres, and fibrillar plexus. The relation of the cells and
& fibrous elements is the same as that which is found in the nerve cord of Branchippus
é where the former lie wholly on the surface of the latter. In the cord of Astacus,
= however, cleft-like spaces filled with the inner or blood-containing sheath penetrate
6 the nerve substance, and the cells to a certain extent occupy these (fig. 34,c). The
