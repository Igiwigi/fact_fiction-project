charge. This does not seem to me to be natural. In a current, whatever form the
discharge may take, or whatever part of the circuit or current is referred to, as much
positive force as is there exerted in one direction, 80 much negative force is there
exerted in the other. If it were not s0 we should have bodies electrified not merely

positive and negative, but on occasions in a most extraordinary manner, one being‚Äù
charged with five, ten, or twenty times as much of both positive and negative elec-
tricity in equal quantities as another. At present, however, there is no known fact

1633. Even in cases of convection, or carrying discharge, the statement that the
current is everywhere the same mnust in effect be true (1627.) : for how, otherwise,
could the results formerly described occur ? When currents of air constituted the mode
of discharge between the portions of paper moistened with iodide of potassium or sul-
phate of soda (465. 469.), decomposition occurred; and I have since ascertained that,
whether a current of positive air issned from a spot, or one of negative air passed
towards it, the effect of the evolution of iodine or of acid was the same, whilst the re-
versed currents produced alkali. So also in the magnetic experiments (307.) whether
the discharge was effected by the introduction of a wire, or the occurrence of a spark,
or the passage of conyective currents either one way or the other, (depending on the
