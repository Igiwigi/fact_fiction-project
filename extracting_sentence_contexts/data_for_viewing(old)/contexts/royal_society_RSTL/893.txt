excepting in the line CD, where the tint is invariably white in
every azimuth, When the polarised light is transmitted
along any of the resultant axes P, P', the two tints diverge
from the poles in the form of a cross, as shown in the pre-
ceding figure.

The effect at O, or the interchange of the blue and white
light between the ordinary and extraordinary rays, is related
to the axis AB alone ; and in like manner the effect at A is
related solely to the other axis O. But though the axis Oo
is more powerful in topaz than AB, yet the values of m and 1
for each axis do not appear to be different; a result which
might have been expected from the fact, that these tints in
different crystals have no relation to the intensity of their
polarising forces. The diminution of the tints m and 7, in
passing from O to C and D, is owing to the action of the other
axis O. At the points C and D blue light alone will be
transmitted when AB, considered as a separate axis, is per-
pendicular to the plane of primitive polarisation ; and at the
same point white light alone will be transmitted when O con-
sidered as a-separate axis of the same character is similarly
placed. Hence it follows, that the transmitted light should
be bluish white, as it actually is, the interchanged portions
being as it were in a state of equilibrium.
