view I entertain of the cause of electro-chemical decomposition, as far as that
cause can at present be traced and understood. I conceive the effects to arise
from forces which are internal, relative to the matter under decompositionâ€”
and not external, as they might be considered, if directly dependent upon the
poles. I suppose that the effects are due to a modification, by the electric cur-
rent, of the chemical affinity of the particles through or by which that current
is passing, giving them the power of acting more forcibly in one direction than
in another, and consequently making them travel by a series of successive
decompositions and recompositions in opposite directions, and finally causing
their expulsion or exclusion at the boundaries of the decomposing body, in the
direction of the current, and that in larger or smaller quantities, according as
the current is more or less powerful (377.). I think, therefore, it would be
more philosophical, and more directly expressive of the facts, to speak of a
decomposing body, in relation to the current passing through it, rather than
to the poles, as they are usually called, in contact with it ; and say that whilst
under decomposition, oxygen, chlorine, iodine, acids, &c., are rendered at the

negative extremity, and combustibles, metals, alkalies, bases, &e., at. the positive
extremity of the decomposing substance (467.). I do not believe that a 8wh-
stance can be transferred in the electric current beyond the point where it ceases
to find particles with which it can combine; and I may refer to the experiments
made in air (465.), and in water (495.), already quoted, for facts illustrating
