is some foundation for the vulgar opinion of workmen, con-
cerning what is technically called the feeding of leather in the
slow method of tanning ; and, though the processes of the art
may in some cases be protracted for an unnecessary length of
time, yet, in general, they appear to have arrived, in consequence
of repeated practical experiments, at a degree of perfection
which cannot be very far extended by means of any elucidations
of theory that have as yet been made known.

On the first view it appears singular that, in those cases of
tanning where extractive matter forms a certain portion of the
leather, the increase of weight is less than when the skin is
combined with pure tannin ; but the fact is easily accounted for,
when we consider that the attraction of skin for tannin must be
probably weakened by its union with extractive matter ; and,
whether we suppose that the tannin and extractive matter enter
together into combination with the matter of skin, or unite with
Separate portions of it, still, in either case, the primary attraction
of tannin for skin must be, to a'certain extent, diminished.

In examining astringent vegetables in relation to their powers
of tanning skin, it is necessary to take into account, not only
the quantity they contain of the subsance precipitable by gela-
tine, but likewise the quantity, and the nature, of the extractive
matter; and, in- cases of comparison, it is essential to employ.
