Stability of Tubes under Combined End and Surface Pressure.

We shall not treat this case in any detail, but it requires notice in connection with
the “localization of collapse” which is observed in experiments conducted upon long
tubes tested under hydrostatic pressure, the permanent distortion being generally
confined to a portion only of the length of the tube. This result is not predicted by
the theoretical formula (83), which suggests a steady fall in the value of the collapsing
pressure as the wave-length increases; and a partial explanation may possibly be
found in the fact that the method of test has generally left a wholly or partially
