and thus since G, (1) = 1 we have Gi*(1) = —40. Combining this with Gj(1) = 40* we have

The function 7, is thus as by

It will be noted that 7, vanishes at 7 = 0 and also at r = a provided J,(/a) = 0 as in previous
sections. Thus the central axis of the dishpan and the side are streamlines as required.
The function y/,, unlike y, has a zero at the first vanishing point of J,(/r), and this fact has
interesting consequences which will be mentioned later. In (4-37) it is easily shown that

The formula for v in (4-27) can be expressed now entirely in terms of the G,(¢) and Bessel
functions. The cae formula for y is
