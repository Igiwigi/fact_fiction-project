.Phis case the pointed process of the palisade cell grows out, and at the same time
goes the same change as occurs in the formation of the lateral enlargement in
first method, becoming homogeneous and staining browner than the rest of the
dy with Fiemmine’s fluid. e further development of the club cells will be followed under (b)
) Origin of Goblet Cells from the Palisade Cells—A young goblet is always
iiginguishable from a young club cell in this, that the upper part of the cell instead of
homogeneous and brown in Fiemine’s fluid and saffranine preparations, is finely
rgoulated and stained red. In fact, the transformation of some of the protoplasm
n mucigen occurs before the cell has been constricted off from the palisade cell that

iges it birth (fig. 9a, 1, 2, and 4, Plate 30). ‘the nucleus too, in this early stage, shows a far more distinct nucleolus as a rule
Hn that of the young club cell, and this large nucleolus is a feature in the nucleus of
fee fully developed goblet cell.
