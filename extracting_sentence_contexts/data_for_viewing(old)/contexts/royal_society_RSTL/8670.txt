2 Destruction of this region causes abolition or diminution of reaction to stimuli on the
ime ide as the lesion.
Z Taken together, these facts establish the localization of the sense of smell in the subi-
2ulum, or tip of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe.
& As to the sense of taste, the positive indications are less distinct than those of 8mell
'Sr hearing.
Z Yet the phenomena occasionally observed on stimulation of the lower part of the
Middle temporo-sphenoidal convolution, viz. movements of the lips and cheek-pouches,
Hay be taken in connexion with lesions affecting this region, and accompanied by loss
ET reaction to stimuli of taste, to afford evidence of no weak character for the localiza-
Ex of taste in or near this region.
Â£ That the centres of gastatory and olfactory perception are closely related to each other
Ynatomically i is rendered probable by the fact, often observed, of loss of taste and smell
Following severe blows on the head, and particularly of the vertex. It is not at all likely
That one and the same cause should simultaneously directly affect all the nerves which
are involved in the sensations of smell and taste; but it is easy to understand that a
contre-coup might readily affect the integrity and functional activity of the lower end of
the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, in which the above experiments serve to localize the cen-
tral seats of these faculties.
We have thus accounted for the senses of sight, hearing, taste, 8mell, and touch, and
given evidence for the localization of each and all of these in the central convolutions.
Whether they are all integrated in the optic thalamus is a subject on which the
experiments I have yet made do not furnish sufficient evidence; but the following
experiment serves to prove that, in regard to tactile sensation, this is the case.
