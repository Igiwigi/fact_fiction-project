The parameters are bounded by the following
conditions:

—l<fxy<1, Os<axy<1, (4.6)
~ ¥Y exv=i (4.7)
X=A,A Y=B,B’

{w(K and Y) — (1/2)(u(X) + w(Y)) = my ylorxy — (1/2)(u(X) + HOD

Secondly, let us discuss more extensively the reasons why we represent a conceptual conjunction
by means of a superposed state vector in sector 1 of Fock space and by means of an entangled state
vector in sector 2. For every X = A,A’, Y =B, B’, the superposition state vector (1/v2) (|X) + |Y))
represents the conjunction ‘X and Y’ in sector 1. This choice expresses the fact that sector 1 of Fock
space formalizes the ‘genuinely emergent aspects of conceptual conjunctions’, — (1 / v2) (|X) +
|Y)) is a new state vector, obtained from the state vectors |X) and |Y) but without requiring
any logical rule to be satisfied. This will be evident in §5 after introducing ‘quantum emergent
thought’. The choice of representing the conjunction ‘X and Y’ by an entangled state vector |C) in
sector 2 allows instead the possibility of describing events that are not statistically independent in
this sector—if we represent ‘X and Y’ by the product state vector |X) ® |Y) in sector 2, this leads to
a probability (X)(Y) in this sector.
