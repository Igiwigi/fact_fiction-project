These may include more complex or varied network structures, data
augmentation strategies or the inclusion of post-processing techniques incorporating contextual
knowledge relevant to the location being examined [46]. It is also important to understand the
rates of deterioration of results when transferring models to unknown scenarios and geographies. Technical difficulties with regards to computational capacity may be influenced by the fact
that analyst interaction cycles will need to be integrated with neural network training and
classification in as close to real time as possible. As an analyst manually detects structures in
a settlement, a machine learning model, computing in parallel, will use this information to
automatically detect the remaining structures in the settlement. It is possible that future work will
include the development of an evolving evaluation framework, incorporating manually tagged
structures that will inform the stop criteria for the adaptation, i.e. the proportion of adaptation

One of the key barriers to the adoption of computer-assisted methods to practical work 2
flows is related to trust.
