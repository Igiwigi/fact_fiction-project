next in order to boron”) would ultimately form boron by a quadruple sub-division. The comparatively small quantities of ytterbium and scandium in these minerals may
easily be accounted for by the assumption that they are more unstable forms of
matter than yttrium and boron. The fact that these bodies give totally distinct line spectra has not the significance
it formerly was supposed to have, for now we know of different line spectra given by
the same body. Argon, with its red and blue spectra, is a case in point, and
Go.pstEIN, as a result of his work on the spectra of Cs, Rb, and K, has come to the
conclusion that the property of emitting two separate line spectra is a general one. Moreover, between the line spectra of radium, uranium, and helium—bodies which
are supposed to be associated genetically—there is no similarity or line in common.
