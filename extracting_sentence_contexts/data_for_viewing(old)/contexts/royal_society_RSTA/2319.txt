Moreover, following [10], only some products of eigenfunctions in equation (4.8) contribute to
the energy flow. In the theory of waveguides, these energy conveying terms are produced by
propagating waves. Thus, the infinite sum reduces to a finite one

N
NU = — 521m x (xkO™ — RO), (4.9)

where 1 counts only the energy conveying terms.

Indeed the latter emphasize the fact that the reciprocity relation, equation (2.4), bi-
orthogonality relation, equation (2.5) and inhomogeneous relation, equation (3.3), all constitute
an energy balance between the transmitted and accumulated energy. As suggested in §3, this


energy balance reduce to modal form thanks to bi-orthogonality and essentially each amplitude
may be found algebraically from a modal energy balance. Further,

Remark 4.1. We may conclude that the l.h.s. of equation (4.1) may be perceived as more general
than the expression from [13]

NE = — Re ((caa* lov,) . (4.10)
