However,
when transparency is demanded, it is important to be clear over what transparency is required
and to whom that transparency is intended. Achieving transparency requires considering who must learn what in order to find a system
understandable. Nearly always, this will encompass the fact of the system’s existence and the
scope of the things it considers, at least in an abstract sense. Sometimes, it will also involve general
claims about the mechanisms underlying the system or properties of the system. The concept
of ‘open-source’ software, or software which has source code that is both freely available and
permissively licensed, strengthens transparency by combining detailed source code disclosure
with the ability to derive additional knowledge by recompiling or modifying the software.°
This stands in contrast to regimes where source code is merely disclosed or is disclosed under
conditions or to specific parties.
