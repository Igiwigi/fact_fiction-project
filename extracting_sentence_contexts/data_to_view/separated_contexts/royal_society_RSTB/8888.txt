However, this limited set is sufficient to reveal the variety of
the mechanisms that control early state transitions in ESCs
and complexity of the regulation. Investigation of further can-
didates will expand our understanding in this area and may
facilitate efforts in deriving naive ESCs from non-rodent
species, including humans. The fact that these actors are
revealed upon 2i withdrawal but are mostly present in the
naive state suggests that ESCs cultured in LIF/serum are
likely to be continuously challenged owing to active MEK/
ERK and GSK3 signalling induced by undefined serum
components in addition to autocrine Fgf4. In this light, the
widely commented upon heterogeneity of ESCs in LS appears
to be a response to an incoherent signalling context, in which
the naive pluripotency circuitry is constantly confronted with
differentiation stimuli. We contend that the defined 2i/LIF cul-
ture system for ESCs provides a more appropriate and accurate
reflection of naive epiblast in the embryo.
