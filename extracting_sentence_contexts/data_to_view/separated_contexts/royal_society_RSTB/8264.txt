When animals frequently encounter congeners in the are well aware that ‘neutral’ phenotypic change
environment, there are clear selective advantages for (change that serves no particular adaptive function)

animals to discriminate conspecifics from heterospecif- is an inherent outcome of evolution. Indeed, the
ics in both mating and territorial contexts (reviewed in original motivation for developing phylogenetic com-
Ord et al. [132]). This should in turn result in con- parative methods was to account statistically for the

siderable selective pressure for social signals to fact that species accumulate phenotypic changes over
convey reliable cues on species identity. Many studies time and tend to share or differ in their phenotypes
have confirmed that species-specific components as a function of their phylogenetic relationships
exist in mating and territorial signals [132]. It seems [137].
