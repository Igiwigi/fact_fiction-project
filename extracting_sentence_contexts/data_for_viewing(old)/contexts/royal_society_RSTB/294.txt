but owing to the degenerated condition of the under jaw in the adult it no longer
reaches the inner angle of the latter. In a young Orycteropus I find the tympanic
ring still connected with the squamosal bone, and, moreover, there is at the distal end
of the pretympanic portion of this ring a distinct process or knob, which indicates the
former articulation with the inner angle of the mandible. In Phascolomys the long:
process of the malleus is very strong, passes through a broad fissure between the
tympanic ring and the periotic capsule, and even in the adult skull almost touches
the typically developed inner angle of the under jaw.

Prrers draws attention to the fact that the quadrate bone most frequently carries
a considerable portion of the tympanum, and invariably so when the quadrate bone is
immovably fixed to the skull, as in Chelonia and Crocodilia, We add the hardly less
important fact that no animal possesses an os tympanicum besides a distinct quadrate
bone.

This statement seems, perhaps, open to doubt, because of the existence of a tympanie
ring in the Anura. This necessitates a consideration of the embryonic development
of the tympanic ring. ‘ ’

According to Baurour (‘Comp. Embryol.,’ p. 483), “ the metapterygoid region of the:
quadrate (in the Frog) gives rise to a posterior and dorsal process, the end of which
is constricted off as the tympanic annulus, whilst the proximal part of the process
remains as the otic (metapterygoid) process, articulating with the auditory cartilage.”

Parker (‘ Mammalia,’ 1885), figures and describes the annulus tympanicus of the
