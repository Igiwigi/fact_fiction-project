The facts now, as well as those formerly adduced, go far
towards proving, that the temperature of warm-blooded ani-
mals is considerably under the influence of the nervous sys-
tem ; but what is the nature of the connection between them ?
whether is the brain directly or indirectly necessary to the

We have evidence, that, when the brain ceases to exercise
its functions, although those of the heart and lungs continue
