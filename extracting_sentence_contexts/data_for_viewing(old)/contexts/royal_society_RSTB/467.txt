differ materially as to the actual mode of development. As already stated (p. 162),
Baurour regards the sympathetic ganglia (in Elasmobranchs) as outgrowths from
the spinal nerves ; while Onopr (working at the same group) maintains that they are
direct proliferations from the spinal ganglia. Moreover, these authors have left the
history of the development of the system in an incomplete state. The earliest steps
in the process have not been described for Mammals ; and the ultimate and peripheral
branches and ganglia have not been traced back to the epiblast. The fragmentary
nature of the observations, and the divergence of opinion regarding them, show that
further investigations are necessary before the origin of the sympathetic system as an
outgrowth from the cerebro-spinal system can be accepted as proved even for any
group of vertebrates, still less for all.

(4) Besides the embryological facts recorded in the preceding pages, it may be
further pointed out that there are strong grounds, histological and physiological, for
drawing a sharp distinction between the sympathetic and the cerebro-spinal nervous
systems.

The cells comprising the sympathetic ganglia differ from those of the spinal ganglia
in histological character, the latter being rounded, the former angular. In birds,
Ramace (25) describes the difference as being very evident, ‘que les cellules des
ganglions sympathiques étaient nettement multipolaires, et qu'il était facile de les
distinguer de celles du ganglion spinal, qui sont sphériques et unipolaires.” The
fibres of the sympathetic system are essentially different from those of the cerebro-
spinal system, being non-medullated branching fibres.
