adicated at about 10,000 feet, and the concomitant cireumstance is observed, that there
s that day a cloud on the top of the Peak (12,000 feet high); and as in ascending we
zadually came underneath the mist, we were evidently approximating to the conditions
Four starting from the sea-level, with the 3000-foot stratum of cloud above us.

A third result we may draw is, that while the expected difference was found between
he wind at the top and bottom of the mountain, viz. S.W. above and N.E. below, the
tratum of cloud was not found in the space between the two, but in or below the
aiddle of the N.E. current of air. This was certainly only the mountain cloud, which
«limited in horizontal extent to a few miles; but even the sea- or the true N.E.-cloud,
Dich was far more extensive,—stretching, in fact, as far as the eye could observe, when
Buy thousand feet above it, —only reached to between 4000 and 5000 feet of elevation,
