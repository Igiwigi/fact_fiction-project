surface temperature. If we consider a hypothetical series of stars having the same
general thermal structure, but different temperatures, the darkening in integrated
ight should be the same for all, but the darkening in a particular wave-length should
decrease as the temperature increases, the darkening in wave-length 2 being a function,
not of 4 alone, but of 4/4,,,.. An application of Wren’s law shows that the darkening
in wave-length A, in a star of temperature IT’, should follow the same law as that for
wave-length A, in a star of temperature T,, where 4,7, = 2,T,. Now 1 H. Cass. is a
star of type B3, with a temperature, say, twice that of the sun. Consequently the
darkening in 24560 is to be expected to follow the same law as that for 19120 in the
sun; 29120 shows in the sun considerably less darkening than 14560, according to
Assor the limb-intensity in 14560 being about 0-25 of the central and that in 29120
about 0-55 of the central. It should be mentioned that the actual darkening found
by Sreseis is much less even than this; in fact, he found no evidence of darkening
at all. But this could equally well be interpreted to mean that the star had an
exceptionally high temperature.

It does not appear to have been previously considered that there should be an
intimate relation between the law of darkening of a star and the distribution of energy
in its continuous spectrum. Causes such as varying absorption in different parts of
the spectrum (departure from gray body properties) and molecular scattering, which
distort the spectral energy curve, should also leave their mark on the law of darkening.
It is one of the objects of this paper to examine these relationships, and to show how
the observed darkening is theoretically capable of affording criteria as to the physical
nature of the distorting causes. In particular, on certain simple assumptions, it will
