One major objective was to avoid interferences between one given analyte
and the others, and, as much as possible, interferences between the analytes and the matrix
constituents. The second major objective consisted of distinguishing the analyte being measured
from other co-eluting or overlapping compounds of the matrix, which is a frequent situation
in perfumes and flavours, as they are often composed of more than a hundred constituents. In
addition, the fact that such quantifications had to meet regulations implied that their reliability in
complex F&F media had to be numerically evaluated. Therefore, the guidelines and norms related
to the validation of analytical techniques had to be applied not only to assess this reliability, but
also to prevent the use of a multitude of methods from studies that involved poor instrumental
set-up or quantification practices (e.g. [9-13]).

2. Basic principles of flavour and fragrance quantification

(a) Preliminary precautions

The following recommendations are crucial to ensure reliable quantification, but they do not fall
exclusively within MS methodology, and so we invite the reader to refer to the articles cited below
for detailed procedures.
