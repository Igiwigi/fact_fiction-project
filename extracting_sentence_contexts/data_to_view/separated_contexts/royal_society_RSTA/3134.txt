ON THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF GASEOUS FLUORINE. 321 In all these trials a singular fact was observed. The index slowly decreased to a
minimum, and, after remaining steady for a few minutes, retrograded by several
points, indicating the presence of an increased proportion of some gas of higher
refractivity. This effect was observed in nearly every subsequent experiment
performed with the prism, and its significance will be referred to hereafter.
