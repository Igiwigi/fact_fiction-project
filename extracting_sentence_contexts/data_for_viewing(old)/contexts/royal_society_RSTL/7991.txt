upon her sails and of the waves upon her hull; and the result of their investigations
as been to encourage the construction of ships of such forms and such dispositions of
Heights as conduce to moderate and easy motions in the waves of the sea. The relative
positions of the centre of gravity and the metacentre, the excursions of the centres of
Spravity and buoyancy, the inclinations of the axis of rotation, and many other like
Huestions have been very fully and thoroughly discussed, especially by modern English
-Maval architects; in some cases, I yenture to say, with even more elaboration and minute-
'Mess of inquiry than their intrinsic importance demands. But while the means of
Securing ease and moderation of movement of the ship at sea have been thus elaborately
Studied, in order, mainly, as we have been told, to save the fabric of the ship and its
Hfastenings from excessive strains, comparatively few writers upon naval architecture have
â€”=pursued the subject to its legitimate and necessary development, by seeking to investigate
Sthe actual longitudinal bending- and shearing-strains to which the fabric is in fact exposed
bon ships of various forms under the yarious cireumstances to which every ship is liable.
VZ But more than this: not only has the question of internal strain and strength in the
=ship been left undeveloped, but a serious fallacy has underlain many of the writings
Hat of men of the greatest eminence upon this subject, viz. the fallacy of considering
Rease of motion identical with moderation of strain. No doubt ease of motion is very
desirable in all ships, and violence of motion tends to distress any given fabric ; but at
the same time it is quite practicable, as will clearly appear hereafter, to s0 design and
build two ships, that in a sea-way the easier of the two shall be the more distressed eyen
with precisely the same structural arrangements, and therefore it is obviously very desi-
rable to examine the actual strains, both static and dynamic, with which we have to deal.
The weakness exhibited by many ships, notwithstanding the greatest care on the part of
the designers, has long pointed to the necessity of further investigation in this direction ;
