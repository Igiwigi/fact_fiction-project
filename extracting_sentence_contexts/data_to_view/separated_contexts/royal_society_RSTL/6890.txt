These levels give a
EZ height above the high-level gravels of 150 to 200 feet, for at the Butte-aux-Cailles these
Z are not more than 130 feet above the river; but some gravels I observed on a hill-terrace
near Mont Valcrien may be as much as 150 to 160 feet above the Seine. Further search
may also show the existence of higher beds; or such beds may have been denuded. However much, in fact, the Loess may extend beyond the limits of the present river-
valleys, it is always bounded by higher hills flanking the 'plains and the lower ranges. Thus, though it spreads over the low plains and hills of Belgium, it does not rise more
than two-thirds up the flanks of Mont St. Pierre at Maestricht.
