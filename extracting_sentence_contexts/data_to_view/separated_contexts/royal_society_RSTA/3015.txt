1, in which, however, the exposures are not quite
comparable. 2. The Displacement of the Lines.â€”A careful study of the photographs, Plate 4,
reveals the fact, first discovered by Humpureys and Monten, that there is a slight
displacement of the lines towards the ved end of the spectrum as the pressure of the
vapour about the are is increased. At low pressures it is not quite definite that this
phenomenon is not due to an unsymmetrical widening of the line, but the photographs
taken at high pressures dispose of this objection, because several lines are then
displaced so much that they are quite clear of their comparison lines. The lines f'1,

f2, J3, at 100 atmospheres, No. 9, Plate 4, show this well, and it is emphasized
in the enlargement, Plate 8, and in Plate 6, fig.
