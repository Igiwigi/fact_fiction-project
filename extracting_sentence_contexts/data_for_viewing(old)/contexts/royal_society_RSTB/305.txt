calling attention to the fact that potential at leg agreed with sign of pole at apex,
while potential at mouth agreed with sign of pole at base, when the body was led off

* Tt is often very difficult by inspection to distinguish between such variations; in the above case it
was impossible to say whether the variation consisted of two movements in the same direction (8S), or
of two movements in the same direction separated by a movement in the opposite direction (snS) ; the
latter is probably the correct reading.

to the electrometer from leg and mouth. And I may add that I also experimentally
verified the fact that, while potential at mouth agreed with sign of pole at base,
potential at rectum agreed with sign of pole at apex.

In the preceding experiments the electrical variations of the heart were observed by
leading off from remote points with the thorax opened, and with the heart therefore
lying in contact with the tissues by its posterior surface only. The next step was to
determine whether the variations can be observed on the intact animal, with the
heart in contact with its normal surroundings.

Experiment 9.—Cat. April 23rd, 1888. Death by chloroform. Led off to the
electrometer by electrodes in the mouth and in the vagina. Variations observed
synchronous with the heart’s beat, but too rapid to allow their character to be deter-
mined. Apparently each variation was double, but it was impossible to tell which
