In contrast with previous models we have explicitly taken the codon sequence into account. Our description is, however, deterministic and is essentially a mean field treatment. This latter
point refers to the fact that as y; refers to an average over mRNAs (see ยง2), we do not take into
account any spatial correlations in the density. Although correlations are likely to have a large
impact on density profiles around bottleneck sites, by comparing with stochastic models which do
take correlations into account [19,41] we predict that the overall behaviour is unlikely to change
qualitatively. We have also neglected any active variation in the initiation rate which may result as
the cell actively responds to starvation: for example, the GCN pathway [4,31] gives rise to a global
reduction in initiation rate, while other pathways act to increase or reduce translation of specific
mRNA species.
