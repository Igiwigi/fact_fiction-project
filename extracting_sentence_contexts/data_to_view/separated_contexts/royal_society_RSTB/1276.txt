_fsumes the existence of a mother polyp which grows vertically upwards, giving off
Bteral buds or stolons, which subdivide repeatedly and give rise to coenenchymal
*Beca, amongst which calicles are here and there formed by the suppression of a limited
mber of tubes. The explanation is ingenious, but it is controverted by the fact
‘Phat there is not, in any colony, any trace of such a central apical polyp, and a study
e the colony, especially of its central layer and of its growing edge, shows most
Ponvincingly that the ccenenchymal cxca are the active agents of growth and
pansion, and that the polyps are only secondarily formed amongst and out of these.
is is shown to be the case by a study of fig. 4; the growth at the edge of the
Zolony is effected by the endodermic outgrowths (MoseLry’s superficial layer of canals)
Which penetrate into the newly formed mesoglea beneath the ectoderm, and thence
“grow outwards as new coenenchyme ceca, (Compare p. 459.) An examination of the
