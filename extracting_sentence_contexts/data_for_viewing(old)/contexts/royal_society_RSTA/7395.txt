makes propagation possible over the whole of the whistler path, but during magnetically
quiet periods the normal ionosphere does not extend up to sufficiently great heights to
support the propagation of a whistler right up to and over the equator, and instead the
waves escape.

On the contrary view that the upper reaches of the ionosphere are in gravitational
equilibrium, this correlation would have to be explained as the effect of an increase of the
temperature of these regions accompanying a storm, blowing the atmosphere and the
ionization up to great heights. Since such a temperature rise is already believed to occur
and to be responsible for the lowering of F, critical frequency which is often noted during
a storm (Appleton & Ingram 1935), this possibility must be considered.

We can in fact distinguish between the two alternatives by examining the day-to-day
variation of the dispersion of the whistlers. If the ionization at great heights had arrived
there by displacement from the F, layer below, then one would expect that the increased
dispersion would be accompanied by a lowering of the critical frequency. If, on the other
hand, the ionization were coming in from outside one might expect a slight positive correla-
tion between the two, since this flux of ionization might make an appreciable contribution
to the electron density in the layer. In fact, the correlation is positive ($8d).

On the whole, then, the evidence supports the view that the ionization through which the
whistlers travel is of extra-terrestrial origin. It must be admitted, however, that the electron
densities required at great heights are uncomfortably large.
