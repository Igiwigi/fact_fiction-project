The much larger amounts now known to have been gathered by the clover
crop, of course renders this explanation still less adequate. On a review of the whole of the results that have been adduced, it cannot be
doubted that nitric acid is an important source of the nitrogen of the Leguminose. Indeed, so far as existing experimental evidence goes, that relating to nitric acid
carries us quantitatively further than any other line of explanation, But it is
obviously quite inadequate to account for the facts of growth, either in the case of
the Medicago sativa grown on the clover-exhausted land, or in that of the clover on
the bean-exhausted land. There is, in fact, nothing in the results relating to the
clover experiment to justify the conclusion that there had been sucha large production
of nitric acid in the subsoil, due to the increased development of the nitrifying
organisms under the influence of the leguminous growth and crop-residue, and their
