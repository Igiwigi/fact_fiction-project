nately in cashing the credit of seed-dispersal interactions in species threatened with local extinction in many areas, such
the Atlantic Forest. These are often species with a high as the primates Brachyteles spp. and the piping guan, Aburria
degree of frugivory that interact with multiple plant taxa jacutinga. However, although these species may be important

and have a low probability of occurrence in sites where locally, they have restricted distributions, and their potential


as rewilding candidates does not apply to all sub-regions. On
the other hand, some species considered common, such as
small generalist birds, had high scores throughout the
whole biome. These frugivores tend to establish seed-disper-
sal interactions with many different plant species, which
makes them good candidates despite the fact that they are
likely to occur in many sites. Such information is helpful
because it signals species that could have their populations
reinforced through management in order to strengthen inter-
actions at broader scales. In fact, common species may be
good candidates for population reinforcement rather than
trophic rewilding de facto [48] when the focus is to restore
ecological services [5]. Those species are unlikely to be
endangered and are more likely to have sufficient captive
stocks or source areas for translocation, which makes them
suitable candidates for such initiatives.

Although our framework provides a useful tool to ident-
