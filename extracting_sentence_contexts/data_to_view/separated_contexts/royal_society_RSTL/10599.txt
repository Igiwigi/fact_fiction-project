C. are nearly proportional to the changes of temperature,* and exhibit no
is with respect to them. The whole range of change, from 17,415 at 14* C.
to 17,262 at 100* C., is only 0'9 per cent. of the total magnetism.
$117, The actual amount of magnetic change, and even its sign, depends on the
* degree of magnetisation. This follows from the known fact that there is a critical
' yalue of the magnetising force, or (more probably) of the magnetisation, below which
heating inereases susceptibility, and above which. heating reduces susceptibility.
(Bavn, Wied. Ann., xi., 1880.) My own experiments have illustrated this in two
ways. In some of them the effects have been studied of repeated heatings (up to
