It follows that the greatest negative value of &U

for the region S + dS can only differ from zero by a quantity infinitely small compared
to «2, and therefore the least positive value of 8°U must vanish for the region S. It has now to be proved that §°U must be capable of a negative value of order a
when the region of integration is extended beyond the region 8. It sometimes seems
to be considered that this may be inferred from the fact of 5°U changing sign when
SU =0. But, as 8°U does not represent the increment of 5°U due to extending the
region of integration beyond S, this is not admissible. If we draw an imperfect
analogy from algebra, we may say that what we have to prove is that in no case does
§U behave as if it had a square factor the value of which, after vanishing, remains of
the same sign, but that, if S be a region of integration of the character supposed in
roposition 2, for which it is possible to make 8°U zero, then for any region including
§§ it is possible to make 5°U take either sign, the limits being in each case supposed
fixed.
