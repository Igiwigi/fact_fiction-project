its place occupied by a number of the small barred vessels which s0 nearly surround:
it. In Plate LLV. fig. 30, a, the crescentic vessel is rather different in form from what it
generally appears to be. Tt is brought into close contact with the very slightly convex
adjoining face of the hour-glass bundle, its own inner surface for nearly the central
half of its length being also flattened, whilst its two extremities are incurved. These
arrangements appear to me to be too symmetrical to be merely the accidental results of
pressure. In Plate LV. fig. 35 this crescentic bundle is broken up into two (a, a'); and
that this subdivision also is not the result of violence, but is a normal organic state, is
shown by the circumstance that each half has its ends curled inwards in the same
crescentic manner as characterized the two ends of the bundle d' of fig. 30—a fact:
A which, as we shall sce immediately, has a physiological significance.
3 The cortical investment of these bundles closely resembles that of the Rachiopteris
E Oldhamia. We have in both a delicate inner parenchyma (fig. 28, g), usually more or
S lea destroyed, a thick middle portion consisting of a coarse parenchyma (þ), and an
= outer dense prosenchymatous layer (4). In the plant under consideration very little of
Athe innermost tissue (9) remains. In one example it is preserved in the canal-like
S S groove (2), and in several I find s8mall portions of it in contact with the bundle. All
Z'these indications tell the same tale, viz. that it exhibits the common aspect of paren-
:2 chyma, but with smaller and somewhat more delicate cells than those which constitute
'S the middle portion of the cortex. This latter structure (4) is exquisitely preserved.
5 1t consists of a yas; multitude of cells arranged, as is 80 commonly the case amongst
*> recent ferns, in interrupted columns running parallel with the vascular axis. These
