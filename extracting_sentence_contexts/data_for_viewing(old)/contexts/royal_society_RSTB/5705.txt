the sodium salt, but even this was still so viscous that centrifuging was necessary to
remove bubbles before it could be polarised. The optical rotation in a 20 cm. tube with
mercury green light was — 0-187° corresponding to [a]i¢: green = — 47°.

Action of Alkaline Iodine.—0-0718 gm. of luteic acid, dried to constant weight, was
treated with alkaline iodine solution. After standing for two hours only 0-47 c.c. of
N/10 iodine had been absorbed. It can therefore be concluded that the substance does
not react with alkaline iodine and hence contains no free CHO groups. This conclusion
is supported by the fact that the substance did not reduce Beneptct’s solution, nor
did it form an osazone with phenylhydrazine.

Section 3.—Acid hydrolysis of luteic acid and examination of hydrolytic products.

10 gm. of luteic acid were hydrolysed with 500 c.c. of N/1 sulphuric acid on a boiling
water-bath for about nine hours. The sulphuric acid was removed quantitatively with
pure barium hydroxide. The filtrate from the barium sulphate precipitate measured
approximately oné litre and was strongly acid in reaction. 10 ¢.c. of this solution
required 4:49 c.c. of N/10 sodium hydroxide for neutralisation corresponding to
approximately 45 c.c. of N/1 sodium hydroxide for the whole solution. Since 10 gm.
of material would require only about 23 ¢.c. of N/1 sodium hydroxide for neutralisation
before hydrolysis, it is evident that the acidity had been doubled during hydrolysis.
