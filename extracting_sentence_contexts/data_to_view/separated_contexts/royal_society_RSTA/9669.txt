Tl Neither the observed nor the supposed collaterals are multiples of A. They
are expressed as multiples of 3. Although they are large multiples, their values are
quite definite provided we know @ priori that the denominators are multiples as
a fact. If the multiple be altered by unity, the resultant quotient cannot come
within the limiting values of the oun. If the normal D,, (2) = 7A = 939078, the order difference over D,, (3) would be
939078â€”888643 (89) = 50435489, and 3343 = 134d, = 50495, so that the order
difference would come out as usual a close multiple of 6, All this group seem to
show the same kind of irregularity.
