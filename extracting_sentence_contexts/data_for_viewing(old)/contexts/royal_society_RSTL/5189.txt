1. IN treating a great problem of approximation, snch as that presented to us by
the investigation of the moon's motion, experience shows that nothing is more easy
than to neglect, as insignificant, considerations which ultimately prove to be of the
greatest importance. One instance of this occurs with reference to the secular
acceleration of the moon's mean motion. Although this acceleration, and the dimi-
nution of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, on which it depends, had been made
known by observation as separate facts, yet many of the first geometers altogether
failed to trace any connexion between them, and it was only after making repeated
attempts to explain the phenomenon by other means, that LayLace himself sncceeded
in referring it to its true cause.

2. The accurate determination of the amount of the acceleration is a matter of very
great importance. The effect, of an error in any of the periodic inequalities upon
the moon's place, is always confined within certain limits, and takes place alternately
in opposite directions within yery moderate intervals of time, whereas the effect of an
error in the acceleration goes on increasing for an almost indefinite period, s0 that
the calculation of the moon's place for a very distant epoch, such as that of the
eclipse of Trares, may be seriously vitiated by it.
