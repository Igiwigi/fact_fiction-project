The available oxygen of the permanganate is. thus
Sinally distributed in two ways, part of it remaining in a form in which it acts gradually
Eon hydriodic acid, and another larger part having no such action. What oxidizing
Substance the colourless solution still contains, whether a less reducible salt of manga-
.2nese, or ome compound produced, as is most likely, by the gradual oxidation of oxalic
Sacid, we do not know; but the fact that some s8ubstance is formed besides a manganous
Zxalt, carbonic acid, and water, is certain. If, however, two products, or any number of
=different products, are formed by the action, according to different equations, of one
Soxidizing substance—binoxide of manganese, for example,—the quantities of this snb-
stance remaining after equal intervals of time should still be in geometric progression ;
for the amounts of each of the products which is formed at any given time is propor-
tional to the whole amount of binoxide present in solution at that time, and in conse-
quence the amount of binoxide which disappears owing to the formation of each of the
products is also proportional to the whole amount of binoxide present.

Let dy, dgy, . .. d,y be the amounts of binoxide which disappear during an infinitesimal
time dx, owing to the formation of n different products, then 2x, 5, 5 are the
amounts of binoxide which disappear in a unit of time owing to their formation, and
each of these is proportional to the whole amount y of binoxide present at a time @;
