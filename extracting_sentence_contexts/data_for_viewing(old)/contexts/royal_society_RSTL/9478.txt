Spider line.

51. A spider line was also used : it was nob found possible to suspend this freely
in the tube. Ib was attached top and bottom to a wire frame, but it was quite loose
between the points of attachment, s0 that it could swing to either side.

Considerable difficulty was found in observing the spider line, as it was lost sight of
the instant it was the least out of focus ; but the general result of the observation was,
that at higher pressures both for air and hydrogen the motion was negative or to the
heater ; but at pressures of less than about 8 inches it was decidedly positive, the fibre
being driven away from the heater as far as its frame would allow.

From the fact that the fibre of silk had shown positive motion 80 nearly up to the
pressure of the atmosphere it might have been anticipated that the spider line, on
account of its much greater thinness, would have shown positive motion even at
pressures considerably above that of the atmosphere. But the reasoning of Art. 46
respecting the differences of temperature to be maintained and the effect of the air
currents, obviously applies with greater force to the spider line than to the fibre of

8ilk, and at once accounts for the observed fact that the positive motion with the
spider line was not obtained until the pressures were somewhat lower than those
necessary for the fibre of silk.
