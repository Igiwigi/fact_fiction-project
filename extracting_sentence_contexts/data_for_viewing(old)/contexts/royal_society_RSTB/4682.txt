The fine specimen (58°2 mm. in diameter, 41°9 mm. in height,
collected by G. E. Drstey, Esq., from the zone of H. subglo-
bosus at Oxted) from which the accompanying text-fig. 3 is
taken, is the largest example of the species that I have seen.
(The original of Plate 66, fig. 1, has a diameter of 57 mm.)
It also shows the longest continuous series of alternate
primaries and demi-plates that I have detected, although
there is an almost complete absence of the sporadic precocious Ter geo specnen of

have great morphological significance, that such a type of structure is absolutely
restricted to the adoral surface of the later members of this species and the petals
of the Clypeastride. The similar plating of some parts of the petals of Heteraster
oblongus (Plate 69, fig. 2) is hardly comparable, since in that case it is clearly an
adaptation towards the accommodation of more plates in one column of the area
