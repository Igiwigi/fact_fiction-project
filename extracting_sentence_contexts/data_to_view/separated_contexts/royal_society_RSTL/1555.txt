They were then'taken down, and being, by

S means of the log beam compaſſes, compared with' the mea-

ſates 6n the plank, the New-England z0d was found to have
; letigthened 503t inch, and the Riga rod 6.641 inch. By which
experiment- the fact ſeems to be eftabliſhed, that Riga fed
wood, notwithſtanding the quintity of turpentine which it
> Contains, 19 more ſuſceptible of the effefts of moiſture than

New-England white wood; Meri Ramspen likewiſe” firids,
that the great plank fo often mentioned, ſuffers, in ordinary
* ſummer weather, an alternate expanſion and contra&tion,
amounting at a medium to 0.0941 of an inch every day : that
is to ſay, if the diſtance between the twenty-feet braſs points
be meaſured from the ſcale, by means of the beam compaſles,
in the evening, it is found to have lengthened next morning
0.0041 of an inch, by the bumidity of the intervening, night. In the courſe of the following day it contraQts again to its for-
mer length, and ſo on. Mr. RAMSDEN has often obſerved
this alternate change in the deal plank ; but it was particularly
on the 11th and 12th of Auguſt, that the quantity was actually
meaſured.
