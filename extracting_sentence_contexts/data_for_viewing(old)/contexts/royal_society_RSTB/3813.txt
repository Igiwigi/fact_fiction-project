type than that on the intermediate parts, being a vestige of the condition found in
the cone axis, where the pitting is multi-seriate, and covers the whole radial surface
of the tracheid, as is the case in tracheids of the Pteridosperms and the more
primitive forms of the Cordaitales.* Thus, the characteristics of the terminal pitting
of the tracheid in Araucariopitys and Woodworthia, considered in the light of fossil
and living forms, present ancestral features which ally these forms to the Cordaitales,
and not to the Abietine.

It is to be recalled in this connection that the living Abietines, in their primitive
regions, show clear indication of Araucarian or Cordaitean pitting ; Scuacur called
attention to this long ago (1862). Figs. 86a, b, and ¢, show the bi-seriate (sometimes
tri-seriate) condition in the root of Larix. The pits are often flattened by mutual
contact, as in the Araucarians. Moreover, the fact that the ray pitting of the pine
tracheid is much specialised in the old wood of stem and root, while in the young wood

* See Section 4a, and cf. GorHaN, 1907, with whose ideas on pitting in general this is in perfect
harmony.

of these regions and in the cone axis these ‘ Grosseiporen” gave place to several
smaller pits, is not without significance in this connection (see Section da). It is
further to be noted that in the older form, Woodworthia, the ordinary pitting of the
tracheids is practically identical with that of certain of the Cordaitales, while in
