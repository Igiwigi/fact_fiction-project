This, which is a necessary consequence of
our hypothesis, is completely verified by experiment. It will of course be understood, that the supposition of the
axis being in the meridian is merely to fix the idea; for a
similar. motion takes place whatever direction the axis of the
Shell may have. It is presumed, that what has now been stated is sufficient,
without referring to any further experiments, to establish the
principal fact adverted to in this letter, viz. that when any
iron body is put in rapid rotation on any line not coinciding
with its magnetic axis, a temporary derangement takes place
in its magnetic powers, which in its effects is equivalent to
a-new axis of polarization perpendicular to the plane passing
through its axis of polarization and rotation. I have stated in the beginning of this letter the motives
which led me to undertake these experiments ; but notwith-
standing I have certainly found a stronger effect produced
by the rotation than I anticipated, yet it does not appear to
be'of a kind to throw any new light upon the difficult sub-
ject of terrestrial magnetism. I think there are strong rea-
ons. for as8uming, that the magnetism of the earth” is of
that kind which we call induced magnetism ; but at present
we have no knowledge of the inductive principle, and are
therefore unable to.judge, how far the earth's rotation may
be influential in producing those discrepancies from the gene-




induced in iron bodies in rotation. 927
