errors. What ground then have we—apart from the agreement with the far superior
determination with the 4-inch lens at Sobral—for thinking that the present results are
more trustworthy ? ;

At first sight everything is in favour of the Sobral astrographic plates. There are
12 stars shown against 5, and the images though far from perfect are probably superior
to the Principe images. The multiplicity of plates is less important, since it is mainly
a question of systematic error. Against this must be set the fact that the five stars shown
on Plates W and X include all the most essential stars; stars 3 and 5 give the extreme
range of deflection, and there is no great gain in including extra stars which play a
passive part. Further, the gain of nearly two extra magnitudes at Sobral must have
meant over-exposure for the brighter stars, which happen to be the really important
ones ; and this would tend to accentuate systematic errors, whilst rendering the defects
of the images less easily recognised by the measurer. Perhaps, therefore, the cloud
was not so unkind to us after all.

Another important difference is made by the use of the extraneous determination of
scale for the Principe reductions. Granting its validity, it reduces very considerably
both accidental and systematic errors. The weight of the determination from the five
stars with known scale is more than 50 per cent. greater than the weight from the 12
