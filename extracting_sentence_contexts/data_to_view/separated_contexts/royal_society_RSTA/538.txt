In this situation, # =0 in Sx and thus Z(K) vanishes. Case 2: ¥ — wy =0 in Sx. The fact that 7g, is max-norm stable locally yields

The case s < } follows immediately from (4.12). For s> we use that & = VY —W solves an
«-harmonic extension problem and then its conormal derivative 0¢& = — limy—o yh sayé is well
defined. We realize that dyé|y=0 vanishes in 2 because s > 3, which together with (4.12) allows
us to derive (4.24).
