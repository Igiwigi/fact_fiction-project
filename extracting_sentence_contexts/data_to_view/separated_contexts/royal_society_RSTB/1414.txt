ease we might compare the sporangiophore with the funiculus of an
iueh a comparison would not advance the question much, for the true
he funiculus itself is still disputed.

: sporangiophore is an axial structure, z.Â¢., a branch, does not seem to us
_ We have seen that the vascular tissue of each pair of sporangiophores is
from the bundle of a bract, and-has no direct relation to the vascular
the axis. Further, the bundle of the sporangiophore is to all appearance a
al one, a fact which would ill accord with a stem-structure. h sporangiophore represents an independent leaf, is a forced, though not
an impossible view. We should, on this hypothesis, have to imagine a
n of alternating sterile and fertile whorls, the latter having twice as many
as the former; and we must further suppose every alternate internode
been shortened until each fertile verticil came to be adherent to the sterile
snext below.
