<2ot gucceeded in explaining the phenomena of asexual reproduction, he has at least the
Qoreat merit of having brought together many interesting observations, the relations of
which had remained unrecognized up to his time. 'The yalue of his suggestions is well
Z8hown by the number of memoirs which in the last few years have appeared on this
Szubject, and by their having produced a discussion in which almost every naturalist has
Staken some part. It is, however, perhaps not going too far to say that as yet no
Katisfactory explanation of the phenomena has been suggested, and that we are now
Sjust as far from knowing as we were twenty years ago, what are the different conditions
Zunder which some eggs remain undeveloped unless they are brought under the influence
Zof the spermatozoa, while others contain within themselves the power of producing
Z oung without the necessity of any external stimulus. Still, though we have been
.2unable to obtain any insight into the philosophy of the s8ubject, we have in this period
Scollected together a great mass of facts which will perhaps ere long lead us to some
Satisfactory conclusion.

E& In a paper *On the Double Method of Reproduction in Daphnia*,” IT lately
Zendeavoured to show that eggs and buds are in fact identical, that they are the two
<Sextremes of a long series, and that therefore every intermediate gradation between them
Swill probably exist or has existed in nature. I however suggested that it would pro-
—bably * be convenient to apply some distinguishing name to those eggs which do not
Zrequire impregnation as a necessary antecedent to development,” and Professxor HuxLEY
Shas since proposed to call them Pseudovaf.
5 This name seems to me very appropriate, and I intend therefore to adopt it, merely
Rrepeating that we cannot, in my opinion, draw any definite line between eggs on the
one hand and psendova on the other, and that in the Bee and many Lepidoptera the
