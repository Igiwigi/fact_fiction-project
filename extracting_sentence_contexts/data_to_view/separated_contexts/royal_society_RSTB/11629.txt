The private
sector has been a key driver in this rewilding paradigm shift, with private landowners responsible for 76% of the elephant
populations and 60% of the area rewilded with elephant (excluding the Kruger National Park [85]). The lessons on rewilding
from South Africa therefore include the need for enabling legislation, the ability of landowners to benefit from wildlife and
economic incentives to support wildlife. Probably the most important lesson is the fact that national paradigms may shift
from one of squandering wildlife to massive large-scale rebuilding of wildlife populations as a national resource.
