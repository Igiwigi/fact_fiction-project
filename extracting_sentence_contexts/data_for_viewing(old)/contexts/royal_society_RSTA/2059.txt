Figure 5. Viscoelastic moduli as a function of shear strain frequency for fixed shear strain amplitude within the LVR, for solutions
of alginate polymer and suspensions of iron particles in alginate polymer solutions: unfilled triangle/filled triangle, sample
OFe-15LVSA; unfilled circle/filled circle, sample 5Fe-15LVSA; unfilled diamond/filled diamond, sample OFe-8MVSA; unfilled
square/filled square, sample 5Fe-8MVSA. Full symbols represent values of the storage modulus (G’) and open symbols represent

of magnitude. On the other hand, for the samples based on MVSA polymer (both the solution and
the suspension) G’ dominated over G” (table 2), i.e. a gel-like behaviour was obtained.

Another feature observed in figure 4 is the fact that both G’ and G” presented approximately
constant values at low strain amplitude (something that defines the LVR), while showing
decreasing trends at large amplitude (above 100% of strain amplitude), with the drop being more
acute for G’ than for G’’. Concerning the dependence of these quantities with strain frequency
within the LVR, as demonstrated by figure 5, in all cases both log G’ and log G’’ increased almost
linearly with log f, a characteristic that is typical of solutions of polymers measured at low to
medium frequency [12]. Note at this point that the linear trends in double logarithmic scale
observed in figure 5 imply a power-law dependence of the viscoelastic moduli with frequency.
We have calculated the exponent of this power-law dependence and we obtained values in the
approximate range 0.6-0.7 (for both G’ and G”) for the samples based on LVSA, and values of
approximately 0.25 (for G’”) and 0.44 (for G’) for the samples based on MVSA. Note that typically
G’ is constant at low frequency for highly cross-linked systems, such as rubber [12]. On the
