No solution of this
problem is, however, possible at present. The next extension of comparisons is naturally to those remains from other regions
that, from their general characters in hand-specimens, have been referred with more or
less confidence to Psilophyton princeps or to some closely related species. Here again
in the case of such specimens from Norway and France the corresponding facts have not
yet been ascertained and detailed comparison is therefore at present impossible. But

* This condition is realised in the remains named Psilophyton Goldschmidti (Haun, 1916.) SPORES OF PSILOPHYTON PRINCEPS, DAWSON.
