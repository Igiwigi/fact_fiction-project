SZ The numbers in the third and fourth columns of this Table, including the Conway as
© well as the Britannia Bridge, present a good agreement. Their general result is this :
2 that in the axis of a rectangular tube, at all parts except very near the ends, the action
© of external magnetic forces in planes normal to-the axis is absolutely destroyed. In the
2 second column for the Britannia Bridge there is one anomaly at Middle of Anglesey Water
8 Tube of which I can give no explanation. It is a certain fact of observation ; it may
5 arise from 8ome peculiar steely character of the iron in its neighbourhood. Putting this
= aside, the other numbers for the Britannia Bridge are exactly what we should have
> expected from a structure s0 closely resembling a bar magnet ; the longitudinal force is
SE greatly increased at the ends, but is diminished in all other points; not, however, as in
© the transversal forces, to its complete annihilation, but diminished by about one fourth
<= part. For all these cases the cireumstances of position of the bridge with respect to the
Ss magnetic meridian are fayourable.
For the second column, as applying to the Conway Bridge, the position is unfavourable,
= the axis of the bridge being very nearly transversal to the magnetic meridian, and the
2 denominator of the fraction consequently very small. Still, referring to the last Table
5 but two, there can be no doubt that the character of the forces is such as we should have
A expected in a tube whose length is directed in the N.W. quadrant, instead of the S.W.
