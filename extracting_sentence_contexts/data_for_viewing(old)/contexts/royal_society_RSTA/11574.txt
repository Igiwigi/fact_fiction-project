quantities of hydrogen diffusing as given by RicHarpson, Nicon, and PARNELL’s
experiments. Hence the efficiency for producing positive ionisation of a given
amount of hydrogen diffusing out of platinum increases rapidly with increasing

temperature.

60 F MR. O. W. RICHARDSON ON THE IONISATION

The fact that hydrogen diffusing out of a platinum wire produces a positive
ionisation proportional to the amount of gas diffusing, taken in conjunction with the
fact that the additional ionisation so produced, even when the amount of gas
diffusing per minute is equal to 1 cub. centim. at 0° C. and 760 millims. per square
centimetre, is only about equal to the positive leak when no hydrogen is apparently
present, proves that the positive ionisation in oxygen and other gases as well as the
negative is not due to residual traces of absorbed hydrogen. This position has
already been shown to be highly probable by other considerations, the chief of which
are:—(1) The constancy of the positive ionisation in oxygen with long-continued
heating, (2) the agreement between different wires, (3) the fact that heating a wire
in hydrogen seemed to produce a permanent decrease, and not an increase, when the
steady ionisation it produced in oxygen was measured subsequently.
