phenomenon. From the results of these and earlier experiments it has been shown,
however, that when two lubricated bodies slide together the lubricant film is partly
broken down, the metals come into direct contact, and some wear of the surfaces
always occurs.

It was shown earlier in this paper that for a given load the track width is roughly
independent of the lubricant present. Furthermore, from the observed slope of the
load-track width curve it was deduced that the metal at the point of contact is under-
going plastic deformation during sliding. On the basis of these observations we can
now form a simple picture of the processes that occur at the points of contact between
lubricated surfaces sliding at low speeds. It seems probable that the metal is deformed
plastically and flows until a joint is formed that is capable of supporting the load. The
fact that the track width (and hence the area of contact) is independent of the
lubricant and is the same whether lubricant is present or absent agrees with this
hypothesis. As a result of the deformation a film of the lubricant will be trapped
between the two metal surfaces and there subjected to very high pressures. The pres-

sure will, however, not be uniform in the region of contact but will be at a maximum
at the centre of this region and will fall off towards the perimeter. It is reasonable to
suppose that under a sufficiently high pressure the lubricant film can be broken
down, allowing the metal surfaces to come into contact and weld together. Only a
portion of the lubricant film in the region of contact (the most compressed portion)
