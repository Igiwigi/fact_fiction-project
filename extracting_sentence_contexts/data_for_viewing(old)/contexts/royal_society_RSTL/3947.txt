Although we have thus been unable to convert marsh-gas into disulphometholic
acid, we have found that this acid may be readily transformed into marsh-gas.
When heated with hydrate of baryta the salts of the acid yield marsh-gas, together
with sulphate and snIphite of barium. A method is thus indicated by which pro-
bably all the hydrocarbons, C,,_, H,z, may be prepared from the corresponding
sulpho-acids *,

The simplicity of relation which exists between snIphacetic and disulphometholic
acid, left no doubt in our mind regarding the convertibility of the former into the
latter. We have established this fact moreover experimentally. Sulphacetic acid,
prepared by the action of anhydrous sulphuric acid upon glacial acetic acid, furnished
without difficulty disulphometholic acid, when again treated with sulphuric acid. A
Similar observation had in fact been made already by M. MeLssNs, This chemist, in
his researches upon the sulphacetates, appears in s0me sort to have anticipated the
existence of the disulphometholates. He remarks that he once found in the mother-
liquor obtained from the preparation of sulphacetate of silver, a crystalline salt the
composition of which he represents by the formula

C, H, Ag.S, 0...
* We are unable to corroborate M. Ainis's remarks, that marsh-gas is decomposed by sulphuric acid into

water, carbon, and sulphurous acid. The acid remains colourless, and the gas after the process exhibits its usual
properties unmodified.
