They possess however two other sources of power, for the sensorial power and the
powers of the living blood have no immediate dependence on either of the former
powers, or on each other.

That the only dependence of the sensorial power is for the maintenance -of its
organs, is evident on the most cursory review of the animal economy. The nature of
the functions of that power alone evinces that the living animal possesses no others
from which it can be derived; and that the powers of living blood have no direct
dependence on its other powers, is proved by the fact, that the blood retains its vital
properties after it is separated from the body*Â®.

With respect to the locality of the latter powers, the powers of the living blood,
it appears from the fact just stated, existing in itself, must be coextensive with
the functions of secretion and assimilation. At first view it would appear that the
functions of the sensorial power, like those of the living blood, pervade every part of
the system ; the power of sensation seems to pervade the whole frame, On ob-
serving the phenomena with more care however, we find the seat of the sensorial
power confined to a small space, when we compare it with that of the nervous power
properly 80 called, the organs of which, we have seen, pervade the whole of the
brain and spinal marrow.

second part of my Inquiry into the Laws of the Vital Functions.
