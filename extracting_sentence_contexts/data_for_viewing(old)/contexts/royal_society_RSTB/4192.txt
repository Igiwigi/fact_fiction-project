winged scapula, but the biceps and supinator longus were fairly good. The operation
consisted of exposing the plexus, and splitting the fifth root after the manner of Harris.
The upper part was cut and turned down and implanted into the sixth root. Gradual
improvement was reported and at the time of publication, namely 14 months, the
deltoid and spinati were much increased in bulk and were used voluntarily with much
power. The deltoid and spinati reacted to faradism and there was no sensory
change.

Tn the discussion which followed this communication, Hap (28) pointed out that
the operation was done five months after the injury and that already some improvement
had occurred in the biceps and supinator longus. He stated that in a traumatic case
not much improvement would be expected before a year, and thought that this case
should have been left alone. He also elicited the fact that no increase in the paralysis
had resulted from the incision made in the sixth root for the purpose of the anastomosis
and stated that the root which had been divided had nothing to do with the return of
power, and was of opinion that the course followed subsequent to the operation was
that followed by an ordinary well treated traumatic case. In support of this it was
remarked by Wr1son that muscles which were not influenced by the operation had also
improved, namely the serratus magnus and triceps.

In 1909 TusBy (30) published some cases in which a similar procedure had been
adopted. In the first case there had been laceration of the brachial plexus, and
complete paralysis of the arm was the result. The operation was performed in
February, 1906, or about six months after the injury, and consisted of dissecting away
a sear involving the upper cords of the brachial plexus. On the fifth root a fibro-
