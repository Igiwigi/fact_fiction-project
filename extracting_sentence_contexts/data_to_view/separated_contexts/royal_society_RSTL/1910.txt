OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND SPINALIS. 637

- It was a 8ingular mistake to imagine that the 8ame conelusion could be Just
in reference to the entire animal, which was incorrect in reference to the ani-
mal deprived of its encephalon. 'The facts are these: in the entire animal,
sensation and voluntary motion, functions of the cerebrum, combine with the
functions of the medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis, and may therefore
render it difficult or impossible to determine those which are peculiar to each;
it, in an animal deprived of the brain, the spinal marrow, or the nerves supply-
ing the museles, be stimulated, those muscles, whether voluntary or respiratory,
are equally thrown into contraction, and, it may be added, equally in the com-
plete and in the mutilated animal; and, in the case of the nerves, equally in
limbs connected with and detached from the spinal marrow. The operation of all these various causes of muscular contraction may be
designated centric, as taking place at, or at least in a direction from, central
parts of the nervous system. But there is another function the phenomena of
which are of a totally different order and obey totally different laws, being ex-
cited by causes in a situation which is eccentric in the nervous system, that is,
distant from the nervous centres.
