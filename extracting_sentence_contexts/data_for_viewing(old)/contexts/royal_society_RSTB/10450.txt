Cas system could provide immunity in E. coli [141]. Other research had shown certain elements of the type II system,
including the involvement of a PAM sequence in interference [6,26,141] but the nature of the cleavage complex remained
unknown. In 2012, tracrRNA, which was previously known to be involved in crRNA maturation [42], was shown to also
form an essential part of the DNA cleavage complex, with the dual tracrRNA:crRNA directing Cas9 to introduce double-
strand breaks in the target DNA [45]. Further simplification of the programmed targeting was achieved by creating a
single-guide RNA fusion of tracrRNA and crRNA, that guides Cas9 for sequence-specific DNA cleavage [45]. A few
months following the description of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology [45], a number of publications demonstrated its power
to edit genomes in eukaryotic cells and organisms, including human and mouse cells [116,117].
