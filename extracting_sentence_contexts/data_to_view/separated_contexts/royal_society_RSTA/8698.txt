Invariant Relations. Certain relations exist between the coeflicients A, B, C, E which remain the same
in form, whatever the number of refracting surfaces. One of these we have already

dealt with, namely the fact that
A-—MB

reduces to an éxpression of the third degree, 7.c., the coeflicients of highest degree in
M in A and B are the same. This we shall refer to as the fist invariant relation (I.). A second invariant relation takes the form

B-C=$(1-M)+4dA/dM,. . . ... . . (ll)
