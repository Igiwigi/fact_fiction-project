In 1838 only 11-25 inches of rain fell during the year. The
atmosphere is remarkable for transparency and freedom from clouds. The foregoing
views appear to be strengthened by the fact, that the observed mean temperature of
the elevated stations of Ootacamund (7221 feet above the sea's level), Merctra
(4500 feet), and Candy in Ceylon (1680 feet), are lower than their calculated mean
temperatures. The calculated mean of Ootacamund is 61*64, observed mean 55%8;
of Merctra 6899, observed mean 65*58; and of Candy 7858, observed mean 73%3. Now all these places are surrounded by an irregular snrface of hill and valley,
generally clothed with eternal forest, presenting an extensive radiating and evapo-
rating surface, and shading the drainage of heavy monsoons that lingers in their
swampy hollows.
