For true it is, as M. EL1E
BravMoNnT had remarked, that © Philosophers and geologists, who from the time of
Ihe Greeks to our own days have seen Etna, covering its flanks with new beds of ashes. Scorize and lava, have admitted, almost without examination, and as a self-evident fact,
at the entire mountain is simply the result of the gradual addition one over the other
2 elements mutually similar, and all resembling the products of the eruptions which

ey themselves have witnessed ” (ib, p. 101).

5 After the publication of the memoirs above cited of MM. DurResNoY and E. ps Beav-
For, all geologists who implicitly acquiesced in the doctrine laid down by them as to
Ahe law which governs the consolidation of lava, became, almost unavoidably, converts
Zo Vox Bucn's hypothesis ; for it was not only necessary to admit a vast amount of
Fpheaval, but to assume that the whole of it had in each volcano been posterior in
Mate to the outpouring of all, even the latest of the highly-inclined lavas, found in
Sach cone.

2 Without attempting in this place to sketch the progress of a long controversy to which
Fhis question gave rise, I may refer to M. D ARculac's able analysis of the memoirs
Selating to it, in the first volume of his * Fistoire des progres de la Geologie,” published
gn 1847, in attestation of the deep impression which the © Elevation-crater” theory had
then made on the minds of not a few of the most experienced geologists in Europe.
