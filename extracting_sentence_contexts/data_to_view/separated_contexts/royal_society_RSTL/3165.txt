From the value of P above, the residual term ought to have for maximum value 1*6,
supposing the permanent magnetism not to act at the same time; in simultaneous
action the maximum would be nearly doubled in the first quadrant (from the weak-
ening of the terrestrial force by the permanent magnetism), and would be diminished
by one-third in the third quadrant ; the signs would be — + — + in the four qua-
drants. The agreement of the signs and magnitudes of the residual terms with those
defined by this law is extremely close; the value for observation þ alone presenting
a sensible disagreement. The theory, therefore, may be considered as perfectly in
accordance with the facts observed in the deviations and intensities at the position of
this compass. The maximum of the term depending on P being (when the permanent magnetism
is counteracted) 16, it was thought unnecessary to encumber the binnacle with a
mass of iron for the correction of that small quantity. The only correction applied
was a magnet, placed below the compass, in a position making the angle whose tan-
