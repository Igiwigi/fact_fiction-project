The differential operator, of order s, that is so frequently of use in the theory
of symmetric functions, viz. :—

can now be employed. Remembering that operating upon monomial symmetric functions,

D, (4) = 1,
D, (b) = 0 unless b = a,

and generally that D, obliterates a number a from the partition of a function and
causes it to vanish if no such number presents itself, it is clear that
