and we have proved that this series is uniformly and absolutely convergent. If we assume such a form of solution it is easy by successive steps to obtain the
values of the coefficients independently of the method we have adopted. What is of
present importance is that we have shown the series to be convergent, a fact which
appears to be denied by Pornoarn.

§ 14. Leaving aside this point, we pass on now to the application of the general
method here explained to the computation of the integrals of particular differential
equations with periodic coefficients, as, for instance, the equation for the motion of
the lunar perigee, considered by G. W. Hint.
