Hence we might expect an increased conducting power in summer and in
daytime as compared with that found during winter and at night. Observation shows,
indeed, that the amplitude of the magnetic variation is considerably greater in
summer than in winter, and we know that the needle is at comparative rest during
the night. The variable conducting power depending on the position of the sun helps
us also to overcome a difficulty which at first sight would appear to exclude the
possibility of any close connexion between the barometric and magnetic variations ;
the difficulty is presented by the fact that the change in atmospheric pressure is
mainly semidiurnal, while the greater portion of the magnetic change is diurnal. This may to some extent be explained by the mathematical calculation, which shows
that the flow of air giving a 24-hourly variation of barometric pressure is more
effective in causing a magnetic variation than the corresponding 12-hourly variation,
but the whole difference cannot be accounted for in this manner, If, however, the
conductivity of air is greater during the day than during the night, it may be proved
that the 12-hourly variation of the barometer produces an appreciable periodicity of
24 hours in the magnetic change, while there is no sensible increase in the 12-hourly
magnetic change due to the 24-hourly period of the barometer. The complete
solution of the mathematical problem for the case of a conducting power proportional
to the cosine of the angle of incidence of the sun’s rays is given in Part II.
