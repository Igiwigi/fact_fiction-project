the exception that one of the lobes (probably the upper) usually received two bundles
instead of three.

The phyllotaxis of the specimen is not perfectly clear, but the arrangement of the
leaf-bases, and more especially of the outgoing leaf-trace-bundles, as shown in the
tangential section (Fig. 19), is strongly suggestive of superposed verticils, As we
know that the number of orthostichies changed between one end of the fragment and
the other, we cannot expect great regularity. The transverse sections are slightly
oblique ; allowing for this, the arrangement of the bundles and leaf-bases which they
show is just what would result from a whorled phyllotaxis, and cannot be reconciled
with any spiral system (see Fig. 19). That the whorls were superposed is further
indicated by the fact that, in transverse sections, a protoxylem-angle, a leaf-trace,
and a leaf all lie in the same radial line, where the arrangement is clearly shown.

We will now sum up the points of agreement between the peduncle and the axis of
the cone. The chief points are as follows :â€”

1. The polyarch stele with prominent angles, at which the protoxylem is situated.
In one section of the peduncle the actual number of angles (12) is identical with that
in the cone.

2. The internal structure of the stele; the conjunctive tissue intermixed with
tracheides ; the multiseriate bordered pits on the tracheal walls.
