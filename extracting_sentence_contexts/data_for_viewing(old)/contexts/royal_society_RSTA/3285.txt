transition as evidenced by the presence of submicron-sized quench vesicles (see §3a). Glasses
of runs KMG5, KMG6, KMG8 and KMG9 were analysed before and after the performed DSC
analyses and show a nearly complete dehydration after several heating and cooling intervals
during thermal calorimetric measurements. KMG5, KMG8 and KMG9 glasses with initially 4.74,
0.24 and 2.24 wt% H20, respectively, have dehydrated during DSC analyses to a residual water
content in the carbonate glass at atmospheric conditions of 0.17 wt% HO. Similarly, the initially
10.43 wt% H2O bearing KMGé6 glass results in 0.02 wt% H2O (KMG6-2) after heating and cooling
cycles through the supercooled liquid regime during DSC measurement (tables 1 and 2).

(c) Carbonate glass transition temperatures obtained from differential scanning
calorimetry

The glass transition and limited fictive temperatures as a function of water content were
determined at 10 K/min cooling/heating rates. Results of the DSC measurements are shown in
figures 2 and 3 and are listed in table 2 for the K7CO3-MgCO3 glasses. The quenched glasses were
heated through the glass transition into the supercooled liquid regime of up to 280°C (553K),
where the liquid is fully relaxed. The glass sample was then subjected to a series of thermal
