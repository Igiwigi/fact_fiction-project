the Reindeer Gallery,
e Flint-knife Gallery, the West Chamber, the South Chamber, and the Steep Slide
Hole. For the most part they appear to have lain at a considerable depth, and, with
De or two exceptions, are the only remains met with in the fourth bed. In the
Eeindeer Gallery a well-marked condyle of the lower jaw was found on the snrface of
Ke fourth hed; but as the ground in that situation had been previously disturbed, the
Fact site is uncertain. In the Flint-knife Gallery a fragment of the femur, 6 inches
Ing, occurred at a depth of 6 inches in the same bed; whilst in the West Chamber an
#tragalus and great part of the corresponding tibia were found at a depth of 13 feet in
e third bed, or nearly at its base. In the South Chamber and in Steep Slide Hole
Ke remains (which, it should be remarked, have not been identified with absolute cer-
Sinty) were met with more <uperficially.
