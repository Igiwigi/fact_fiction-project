dulum, when passing the aperture through which alone the disk can be seen, as indica-
tion of the Coincidence of the two pendulums in the times of passing their respective
quiescent points; and supposing that there are trifling errors in the adjustments
of position ; it is seen in practice, or is shown by a very simple investigation, that the
disk will first disappear in passing from one side (suppose the right side) towards
the centre, then will disappear in passing from the left side (after which, if the errors
of adjustment are in the proper direction, it will be invisible during several vibra-
tions), then it will reappear on the left side, and will finally reappear on the right
side. Either the mean of the times of the first and fourth phenomenon, or the mean
of the second and third, or the mean of all four, may be used as the true time of
Coincidence; and it was left to the discretion of the observers to adopt which they
preferred. They chose, in every case, to observe the first and fourth only. This
amounts in fact to using only one side of the aperture.

It is necessary for the success of this observation that the arc of the detached
pendulum be less than that of the clock pendulum ; in fact it was always much less.
It is indifferent whether the detached pendulum vibrate quicker or slower than the
clock pendulum ; in fact it always vibrated slower.

31. Several Coincidences were always observed at the beginning of a Swing, and
several at the end. These gave the Interval of Coincidences nearly enough to enable

. me to fix upon the number of intervening Coincidences. In general, some of the
observed Coincidences were rejected, 80 that from two to five Coincidences were
retained at the beginning, and a number at the end 80 corresponding that the differ-
