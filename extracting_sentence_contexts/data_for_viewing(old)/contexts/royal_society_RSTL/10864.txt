a double band occurs between D and E and a feeble band at D (spectrum 13, Chart Â£1)
In the s8tomach-wall I only observed the bands of oxyhzmoglobin. *

In the $pra renal capsule the medulla hows the bands of hamochromogen well

marked, in fact its firs6 band is black. In the cortex the spectrum is mainly that, of
oxyhemoglobin, while the intermediate zone gives the spectrum of a histohamatin.
These spectra are figured in spectrum 14 and 8pectrum 15, Chart IT. The significance
of these spectra will be referred to again.

In the rat (especially after injection of the blood-vessels with alt solution) well-
marked histohzmatin spectra can be seen. The kidney (spectrum 16, Chart IL) is
remarkable for the resemblance of its spectrum to that of myohematin, the liver shows
- a feeble band at D, and a darker one between D and E, the pancreas a similar spectrum
to that of the cat's pancreas, the spleen, a spectrum like that of the liver, and the
stomach-wall a beautifully defined spectrum, closely resembling that of the kidney
(spectrum 17, Chart II.) In the wall of the intestine similar bands occur, and
the adrenals show a well-marked hazzmochromogen spectrum, which is not as distinct
