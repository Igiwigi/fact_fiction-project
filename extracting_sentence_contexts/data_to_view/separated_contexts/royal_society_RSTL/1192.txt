226 Captain ANDERSON 0n the peculiarity of the tides

as far as the entrance of the Sleeve. From this last men-
tioned fact it evidently appears, that the flood tide from the
westward forms two distinct branches at the Kentish Knock,
taking different directions; the smaller of which, consisting
of the stream of the tide within the Goodwin Sands, takes its
course W. N, W. up the Queen's Channel, as before stated;
whilst the larger, consisting of the stream of tide zwithout the
Goodwin, continues its course E, N. E. and easterly along the
Flemish and Dutch coasts, until it is lost near the entrance
of the Sleeve, in the great body of tide from the northward
and eastward. The opposite tides which meet in the North Sea do not
meet in a line directly across any part of it, but in a diagonal
line, extending from the Kentish Knock to the entrance of
the Sleeve; where there is no tide, but a strong current,
which almost always sets from the Jutland to the Norway
side in the Sleeve; and which most probably proceeds from
the eddy, produced by the great body of water coming round
the Naze of Norway, meeting the remains of the western tide,
aided by the reaction of the Jutland shore. In fact, there is
hardly any tide observable between the Horne reef and the
entrance of the Sleeve.
