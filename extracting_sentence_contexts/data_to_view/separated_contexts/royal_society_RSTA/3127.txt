Comparing Tables XVIII. and V., we see that in both the amplitude of the
Z 24-hour term varies much with the season; but whereas in the case of P it is
2 conspicuously largest in winter, that is precisely the season when it is least in B.
3 Table XVIIL shows apparently a secondary minimum for ¢, in summer, but the
2 smallest value in summer is 13 times the value in January. The fundamental nature
‘@ of the difference between the annual variations of ¢, in B and P ean in fact be seen at
a glance on comparing the heavier and lighter full line curves in fig. 3, which repre-
sent the monthly values expressed as fractions of the arithmetic mean,

The phase angles a, in Table XVIII. show erratic variations in the winter months,
which are very probably fictitious.
