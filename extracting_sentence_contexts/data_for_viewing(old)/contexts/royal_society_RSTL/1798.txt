suffice, however, to show that both these effects are merely
_- modifications of one and the same.'- It is-not to, or from the
wire as guch,' that 'the superficial particles radiate; they
merely follow the direction/'of the-predominant electric:cur-
rents in their passage through the liquid. It is in- fact the
case of the source of positive electricity, being, the mercury
itself, instead of 'its being conveyed to it from a pile at a
distance.

27. Having thus distinetly traced the alteration in the me-
chanical effect by contact with the negative pole, to the amal-
gamation of the mercury with sodium, the knowledge of this
fact led me to investigate more minutely the effects of diffe-
rent metals in their contact and amalgamation with mercury ;
and the results T have encountered in the course of these en-
quiries, appear to me 80; remarkable, that I cannot forbear
annexing them, especially as they afford an explanation of
almost every. anomaly which perplexed me in the com-
mencement of the investigation.‚Äù In order to render the effects
less liable to objection,.as well as more distinct and striking,
I now used solutions of potash or soda, pretty highly impreg-
nated with the caustic alkali, for the conducting liquid. This
has the advantages at once of high conducting power, and
of producing no currents whatever in pure mercury, neither
pole being placed in! contact. Of course, whatever motions
