domain of glial cells. In this review, we discuss the latest find- homologues. NMDARs are neither evenly nor randomly dis-

ings on the organization, the endogenous control and the tributed along the dendritic shaft, and probably are not as
functions of NMDARs at extrasynaptic sites, and what role free to diffuse as demonstrated in cultures [38-40]. This chal-
glia may play in the activity of these receptors. lenges the common idea that extrasynaptic NMDARs are

essentially a reserve pool of receptors, waiting to be recruited

to synapses. In fact, the finding that these receptors are clus-
2. Defining the extrasynaptic space tered to very specific cell contact areas suggests that they may
serve a distinct signalling function, independent from their
synaptic homologues. The work from Harris & Pettit [26]
already supported this idea by demonstrating that synaptic
and extrasynaptic NMDARs represent distinct and stable
pools of receptors at the surface of CA1 neurons in hippocam-
pal slices.

Making sharp delineation of synaptic and extrasynaptic spaces
is challenging, especially when one tries to reconcile data from
microscopy and electrophysiology. This difficulty arises from
the fact that what one considers as extrasynaptic based on
