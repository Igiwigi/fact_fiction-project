Soc.,’ p. 59 (1933). PHOTOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATION OF GASEOUS EXPLOSIONS 43

Fig. 13 is of two separate explosions (a) and (6) through a moist 2CO + O,
medium in a tube of 3:62 mm internal diameter, this being near the limiting
diameter below which detonation would be altogether suppressed. The interesting
fact is shown of the detonation being alternately damped down by the cooling
action of the tube wall and afterwards re-initiated. This is, we think, due to the
essentially dual character of the spinning detonation as an unstable and separable
association of a “shock wave” anda flame-front. For with a sufficient cooling action
of the tube walls, separation of the two is sooner or later effected with the result that
the “shock wave” component goes on ahead of the retarded flame-front component.
