An overarching
problem is that the theory of the very small, quantum mechanics, and the
theory of the very large, Einstein’s general relativity, are not fully compatible. This means, for example, that we cannot achieve a complete, self-consistent,
description of black holes (Barcelé et al. 2009). In fact, we do not really know
if they truly exist in the form that Einstein’s theory predicts, as the extreme
conditions in some black holes require a quantum mechanical version of gravity,
which we do not have. But it is not only black holes that pose problems. Even
more extreme conditions existed in the early universe, directly after the Big
Bang.
