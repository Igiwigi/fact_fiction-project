voured me with an account of their results, which, as will be
seen by a reference to their respective tables, perfectly co-
incide, in their general import, with those of Lieut, FRANKLIN.

* Captain Ross in his account of a * Voyage to the Arctic regions,” has himself
published some of the results which he obtained respecting the temperature of the
sa in Davis's Straits, and Baffin's Bay, Thus in latitude 72,22, longitude 7g, he
found the temperature of ,the bottom of the ea, at the depth of 1050 fathoms, 28,5%
(Appendix, p. Ixxxv.). And in latitude 72,23, having examined the temperature of
the sea at the depth of 500, 600, 700, 8oo and 1000 fathoms, he found that it gra»
dually decreased from 359 to 284 (Appendix, page cxxiv.), These differences,
though not $0 considerable as that above related, all concur in establishing the ge-
neral fact, that the lower strata, in that particular track of the northern ocean, are
colder than the surface, The instrument which Captain Ross employed, was a regis-
ter-thermometer, the indications of which were occasionally compared with the tempe-
rature of the mud and earthy fragments of various kinds which he raised from the
bottom of the sea, by an appropriate instrument of his own contrivance z as this mud,
both trom the quantity raised, and from the mannerin which it was confined, retain-
ed its temperature for a sufficient length of time not to be materially altered on reach=
ing the surface,


of sea waters, in different parts of the ocean, &c. 185

On the other hand, Lieut. Paxxy, who had the command of
