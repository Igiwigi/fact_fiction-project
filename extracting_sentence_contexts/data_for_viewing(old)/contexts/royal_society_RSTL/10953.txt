The great orbitosphenoid (0.8.) has its moderately broad base or proximal part
divided off from the presphenoid merely by an inferior groove ; it curls round behind
the ethmoidal masses (al.e.), widening, expanding, and becoming convex. Nearly
half-way towards the outer- margin is seen the optic foramen (II.), which lies nearer
the hind than the front edge of the band. The free upper edge of the orbitosphenoid
(0.8.) is nob 8een in this figure (se fig. 2), but i can be 8een that the wide upper part
is continuous with the nasal capsule (al.e.) in front, and with the gupra-auditory
region of the side wall of the skull (s.4.c.), behind.

In this early vegetative state of the endocranium there is s0mething very fower-like
in its various parts, both as to their shapes and their development. Right and left of

which is only partly 8npported by the feeble, and sometimes detached, recurrent cartilage. The fact is
that these curious and enigmatical organs dominate different skeletal parts in different types.


DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL IN THE MAMMALIA. 127

the widening skull-beam (6.s.), now becoming parachordal, and also osseous, there is a,
large leafy growth, a broad petaloid, ear-shaped tract ; this is the free, outlying
alisphenoid (al.s.). This © wing ” is broadly falcate, the handle being made by the
cutting away of its proximal part to widen the sphenoidal fissure ; the blade has its
antero-external, sharp edge equal to a quadrant ; its point is 80mewhat rounded ; and
its back, looking towards the auditory capsule (ch.), is gently concave. . This hinder
wing does nob quite reach to the margin of the continuous skull-wall (0.s., 8.4.c.).
