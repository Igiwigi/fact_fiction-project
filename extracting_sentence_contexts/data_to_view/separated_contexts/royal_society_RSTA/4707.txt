¢ is not usually very considerable compared with K’, and
thus oblique incidence on the prism does not very greatly affect the deviation,t yet it
would seem desirable to have observations at oblique incidence, as they would give
data for determining the imaginary part of the index also by this uniform method,
and thus its complete value. If this were known for the neighbourhood of an absorp-
tion band, we should possess all the data requisite to guide and correct theory in the
matter of optical dispersion ; but a knowledge of n by itself is not of much service in
this respect. The value of this method of prismatic deviation lies in the fact that
the complex index is determined without the intervention of any considerations as to
dynamical theory or the etfect of surface contamination on polarization, which must
enter into the interpretation of experiments on reflexion. that is

35. When the local part ot the forcive on the polarized molecules of the medium,
arising from their interaction with the neighbouring polarised molecules, is left out
of account, the remainder, which is the mechanical force on the element of volume, is
derived from the energy function — (f’P + 9’Q+A’R); this would be also a
potential function of the forces were it not that in it only the electric force (P, Q, R)
is to be varied.
