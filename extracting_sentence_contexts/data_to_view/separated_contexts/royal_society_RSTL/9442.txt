For each of the 0 singularities

(=o)

we have a=\ and the value of E(a—1) is =0(\—1) : this is =0 for the value A=1,
which is ultimately attributed to A.

respectively. We assume X=1, and there is thus no singularity (ys) :

I recall that, considering the several partial branches which meet ab a singular
point, M denotes the 8um of the number of the intersectiovs of each partial branch
by every other partial branch (s that for each pair of partial branches the inter-
sections are to be counted twice). Supposing that the tangent is z=0, and that for any
two branches we have 2; =Ajar, 2,=Agz* (where py, Py are each equal to or greater
than 1), then if pz=p,, and 4 —z=(A;—Az)z”: where A;—A, not=0 (an assumption
which has been already made as regards the cases about to be considered), then the
number of intersections is taken to be =p, ; and if py and p, are unequal, then
taking py to be the greater of them, the leading term of 4—z, is =AjzP, and the
number of intersections is taken to be =p, ; viz., in the case of unequal exponents,
it is equal to the smaller exponent.
