order of a million or more is a commonplace in real-life, it is clear that adding volume provides
increasingly less return on investment in terms of gain of physical information. We speculate,
without proof, that this a general rule in the natural world.

Let us now come to the worst-case scenario: data which destroy information. Eventually,
additional data may even contradict previous data, perhaps because of inaccuracy but more
devious scenarios are not hard to imagine, thereby destroying information, because the new and
the old data annihilate each other. In the latter scenario, information gain turns into information
loss: seeing too much starts to be like not seeing enough, to borrow from C.S. Lewis again.

We argue that such a dual trend applies to the DIKW chain as well, at least to the two lower
layers: too much data is just like no data all. In fact, this is possibly still more general: in a finite
world, close to capacity, competitive interactions arise which either annihilate the return on
investment (information per data unit) or even make it negative, thereby destroying information
and productivity, over-communication being a well-known example in point.‚Äù

Of course one can argue that, in actual practice, this depends on where the capacity is, so that

BD can move it upwards and shift the problem away. We maintain that such threshold shifting : =
without due insight is purely chimeric. Unless we can apprehend the logical structures underlying : =
any given phenomenon, we may just keep generating data conflicts that data accumulation alone 1B
will not be able to resolve: in fact, quite the opposite. :2
In science, we strive to go from data-starved to data-rich, yet a blind data-driven procedure, 8
