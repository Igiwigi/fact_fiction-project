Fic. 28—A part of a parasagittal section of an arm of Marthasterias glacialis through the line of junction
of the adambulacral and ambulacral ossicles, Fixed in Susa solution, stained Mallory’s triple
stain. adamb. oss., adambulacral ossicle ; adamb. sp., adambulacral spine ; amb. oss., ambulacral
ossicle ; coel. epith., coelomic epithelium ; conn. tiss., connective tissue ; ect., ectoderm ; Jat. m.n.,
lateral motor nerve ; Jat. trans. musc., lateral transverse muscle ; long. adamb. musc., longitudinal
adambulacral muscle ;_n. fibril. exp., expansion of the subepithelial fibrillar plexus, probably
associated with the innervation of the longitudinal adambulacral musculature.

Apart from this postulated local innervation of the longitudinal adambulacral
muscles and a similar, but better defined, direct innervation of the muscles of the
pedicellariae, there appear to be no indications of local fibrillar development in the
neighbourhood of other sets of muscles either within the arm or disk of Marthasterias
glacialis. There are, in fact, many muscles the centres of innervation of which

cannot even be conjectured. Among these we may include the superior transverse
and the longitudinal muscles of the ambulacral ossicles, the muscles of the tube feet,
the circular muscles of the disk, and the muscles connecting the odontophore and oral
plate. It is certain that no well-defined motor tracts innervate any of these muscles,
but the possibility of innervation by tracts composed of but few fibrillae which would
not easily be demonstrated by the less specific staining methods must not be over-
looked.
