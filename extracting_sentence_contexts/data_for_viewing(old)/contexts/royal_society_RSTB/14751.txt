result. The pitfalls of equating social insect workers and
human soldiers are illustrated by attempts to apply Lanche-
ster’s laws of human warfare strategy (relating mortality to
aspects of relative strength of opposing forces) to ant conflicts:
across several species, outcomes do not follow or even run
counter to the Lanchester predictions [22-24]. Indeed, the
above examples notwithstanding, group-level combat among
conspecifics is relatively rare in the social insects. The weap-
onry borne by social insect workers is primarily used to
defend their resources (stored food and vulnerable protein-
rich brood) from heterospecific predators and kleptoparasites,
rather than from conspecifics [22,25,26]. Many conspicuous
colony-level conflicts are in fact attempts to withstand
heterospecific robbing [22,27,28].
