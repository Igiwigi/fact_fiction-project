Invariance of r.m.s. deflexion on adding sources of fluctuation

The form of (19) is instructive. From (19) and (11¢c) one can obtain Ising’s result by
considering, for example, only the random couple, provided that only the mechanical
damping is considered, the electromagnetic damping and the random e.m.f. being ignored. This arises from the fact that FF and (G?/R2) EE are proportional to x and G2/R respectively,
which is substantially Zernike’s explanation of why his calculations give the same results
as Ising’s. It is worth stressing this point, as it gets at once to the origin of the confusion which
exists on this subject. If one desires a picture of what is happening, EE and FF may be
regarded as measures of the tendency of the corresponding random forces to produce fluc-
tuations in current and deflexion respectively.
