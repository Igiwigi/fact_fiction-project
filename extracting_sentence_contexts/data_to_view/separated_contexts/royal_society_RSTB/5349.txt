In the great majority of cases the worm manages to get the upper hand and grows to
sexual maturity within the host, but occasionally the fly, during its final metamorphosis,
is able, by some means, to build up its gonads in the normal manner. When this happens
the worm fails to grow, remains non-functional and becomes degenerate. There appears,
in fact, to be a race between the development of the worm within the pupal fly and the
gonads of the latter. Generally the former, but sometimes the latter, wins. These
relationships may possibly be explained on the supposition that the worm secretes or
excretes something, perhaps from the intestinal gland, which prevents the normal
growth of the hostâ€™s sex-cells.
