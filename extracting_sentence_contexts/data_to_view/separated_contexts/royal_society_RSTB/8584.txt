Other mechanisms have been proposed to explain
observed regime shifts in some exploited marine ecosystems
[52]. These hypotheses generally invoke fishing, which may
unbalance species interactions and lead to persistent ecosys-
tem changes. The prey-to-predator loop is based on the fact
that many prey feed on the eggs or larval stages of their
predators [52]. When the predator declines because of an
external force such as fishing, this can lead to the outbreak of
its prey, which may in turn prevent the recovery of the predator
because of predation pressure at the egg or larval stage. A key
assumption here is the reduction of the predator by fishing.
