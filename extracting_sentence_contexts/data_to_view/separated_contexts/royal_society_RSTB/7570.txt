The
behaviour of the migrant, however, is made up, apart from its locomotion, almost entirely
of reactions of the immediately regulatory type. This is, no doubt, one reason why migratory
behaviour has often seemed to be something quite apart from all other kinds of behaviour. The migrant’s tendency to go straight is the sensory-regulating type of behaviour main-
tained in so exceptionally pure a form that it has given the impression of veritable indepen-
dence of the environment, instead of the delicately adjusted, direct dependence which it in
fact expresses. The tendency to go straight, and the going itself, are both outcomes of the locomotory
drive. That drive, the only feature peculiar to or ‘innate’ in migrants, is not itself directional
in any sense.
