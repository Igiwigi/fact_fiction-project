We cannot, from the above, deduce Evuuzr's solution, because that solution is
expressed in ascending powers of t, and not of x or y. If, however, for A(t), /4(t),
F,(t) we substitute EuLsr's forms of those functions, and make f=#, we shall obtain
the result in question. The general solution (19.) has been given in order to illustrate the fact before
adverted to, that when T\ of (17.) is not simply a function of D, the derivation of the
coefficients of the final series may inyolye operations which it is difficult to perform. We shall now show how, by a linear transformation, the difficulty may be evaded. As8ume xzâ€”y=s, z+y=t, then FECL IL=T+S,
