With the advent of a novel culture system for PGC induction,
molecular events driving the specification and differentiation
of this unique cell lineage are being uncovered at an ever
increasing pace. Systematic investigations have revealed a
precise order of signalling events required for the arrest of
mesodermal induction simultaneous to the retention of under-
lying pluripotency and the push towards the unipotent state of
developing PGCs that undergo an epigenetic re-setting event
prior to meiosis or spermatogenesis. Although these events
have been extensively studied and well described, we are

still at the beginning of understanding the underlying mechan-
isms and their functional implications. The fact that even the
powerful combination of the three transcription factors
BLIMP1, PRDM14 and AP2y is not sufficient for inducing
this cell fate until the correct developmental window is reached
in the pluripotent postimplantation epiblast cells or their
in vitro counterpart has opened up further questions of
developmental plasticity and competence.

We have here described molecular events shaping the pro-
cess of PGC specification and reprogramming with a specific
perspective on the role of transcriptional enhancers in cell fate
specification. The concept that the epigenetic state of enhancers
defines or at least contributes to developmental competence
