The compressed
metal was somewhat porous, and heat might have been produced by the absorption of
the turpentine in its pores, and there might be a further error from hygroscopic water. The former 8upposition could be only decided by enclosing the metal in some
impervious envelope, which has not yet been done ; the latter possible error was as far
as practicable avoided by drying the glucinum for two hours at 150* before each
experiment, But, even supposing the above results to be erroneous to the extent of
10 per cent., it is still certain that the specific heat of the metal is nothing near 06,
as it ought to be if the atomic weight were 91. The result is unfortunate for the periodic law, and is the first serious rebuff which
this useful generalisation of facts has received. Glucinum, with the atomic weight of
9'1, finds its natural position as the first element of the magnesium group ; but if its
atomic weight is 1365, it falls between carbon and nitrogen, and entirely contradicts
the firsb principles upon which the tables have been constructed. With an atomic
weight of less than 12 ib might be easily introduced, and it is possible that when
absolutely pure such a result might be obtained.
