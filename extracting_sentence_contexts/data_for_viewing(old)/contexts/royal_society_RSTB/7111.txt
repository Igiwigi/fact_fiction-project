for a reason which I explain shortly, the vessel must have another name, and I am calling
it simply the lateral vessel.

The scutal vessel at its upper limit sends a branch down the rostral side of the adductor
muscle which peters out in the connective tissue between the muscle and the rostrum.
Similarly, the lateral vessel on reaching the lower limit of the adductor sends a branch
upwards (figures 5 and 11) which also dwindles and disappears. The adductor muscle is thus
almost completely encircled at the margin of its attachment to the scuta by large blood
vessels in the form of a reversed C.

At the level of the top of the attrahens muscle there is a watch-pocket valve, allowing
the blood to pass from the scutal vessel into the lateral but not vice versa. There is a valve,
in fact, which controls the passage of blood back from the capitulum, and hence peduncle,
into the body. This in itself would not necessitate a different name for the two parts of the
apparently single vessel above and below the valve. But in the preliminary study of
Conchoderma auritum I have found that the lateral vessel consists of the sheath of the attrahens
muscle, or, to put it another way, the lateral vessel contains the attrahens muscle. The valve
occurs just where the scutal vessel enters the muscle sheath. In this form, therefore, the
two parts of the blood channel are very different in shape and constitution and naturally
require separate names. It was the discovery of this valve in Conchoderma that made me
look for such a structure in a homologous position in Lithotrya.
