many places, whilst in others they have fallen out ; but enough remain to show their
identity with the row of oval dark bodies, which, with light interspaces, constitute
the older, more solid portion ; this is especially well seen in fig. 12, in which it is
obvious that the succession in series of dark ovoid bodies are not markings in an
individual fibre, but consist of a series of parallel fibres cut across obliquely.

This same appearance is seen in one of Mr, Leon Witrtams’ photographs (fig. 83
of his paper), though he appears to interpret it differently.

It will be noticed that in these oblique sections the partitions of the honeycomb
are well stained, as they usually are; but as we progress further into the more
formed enamel the corresponding areas become light, and it is the contained fibre
alone that is stained. In fact, the septa have almost disappeared under the action

of the decalcifying acid ; and, still further, in yet more developed enamel, they quite
disappear, leaving the fibres free.

In other words, the most calcified portions dissolve in acid, those less calcified
remain and take the stain; while in completed enamel the interstitial parts remain
the most susceptible to solution by acids, as is exemplified by the effect of washing
