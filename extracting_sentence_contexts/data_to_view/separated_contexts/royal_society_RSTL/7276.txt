Received March 11,—Read March 28, 1867. Tz hourly records of the magnetic declination, systematically kept at the Flagstaff
bservatory at Melbourne, Victoria, during the period from the 1st of May 1858 to
Fhe 28th of February 1863, haye been discussed with a yiew to determine the Jlunar-
jurnal yariation to which this magnetic element is 8ubjected. The results arrived at in
She course of this discussion, eliciting, as I believe, facts hitherto unnoticed, induced me
& think it important to have them brought before the Royal Society, with no other
Spbject in view but to direct the attention of scientific men to a subject of such yast
Hport for the development of the science of terrestrial magnetism.
= The process adopted in reducing the observations, in order to eliminate the solar-
Aiurnal yariation of the magnetic declination, is identical with the one generally adopted
Z 8uch cases. The limit of disturbance was taken to be 3:61 minutes of arc, and all
Qourly directions which differed from their final normals by this value, or more, were
Zonsequently omitted from the record. This elimination of the larger disturbances
Having been effected, from every remaining reading (R) of the magnet's direction the
Eespective final normal (N) was subtracted, thus causing the residuals (R—N) to be
Aevoid of the influence of the solar-diurnal variation.
