presenting the facts were considered. The first, that of treating each genus separately
and then reviewing the anatomical characteristics of the family as a whole, was dis-
carded; it would involve much repetition, because the genera are very much alike in
several of the features examined. The second method, which is the one adopted, is to
consider each anatomical feature separately, establishing so far as possible the position
of each genus in regard to that feature, and finally to give an abbreviated description
of the genera, picking out the particular features by which each can be distinguished
from the rest. The position of the genera is discussed and the proposed changes
explained and justified in § XII. By this means the material relating to the systematic
position of the genera can be placed together and can be read without the necessity of
disinterring it from a mass of anatomical detail. Similarly, each separate anatomical
feature has as far as possible been treated comprehensively in the appropriate section,
so that the facts relating to any particular tissue can be found together.

II—TEeErRMINOLOGY

The technical terms used in this paper are for the most part those approved by the
International Association of Wood Anatomists, and published in the ‘‘Glossary of
Terms used in Describing Woods” (1933). Where these terms are new, or differ from
those previously in use, they are explained in footnotes.
