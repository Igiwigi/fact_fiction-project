acid).

The acid described in this paper is a metabolic product of P. spiculisporum Leuman.
This species was isolated by 8. G. LrHMAn (1919) from the rootlets of apparently healthy
cotton plants taken from a field in Anson County, N.C., U.S.A. It derives its name
from the fact that “the walls of the ascospores bear minute spines.” The culture used
was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and bears their Catalogue
No. 1136, Taom and Cuurcu Collection 4391.

It was noticed that, when cultures of P. spiculisporum, grown in test tubes on the
usual CzAPEK-Dox medium, were filtered and acidified, an amorphous insoluble white
precipitate was produced. This precipitate may be readily crystallised from boiling
water and constitutes the product, the preparation, properties and constitution of
which will now be described in detail. This product was shown to be the lactone of
y-hydroxy-f8-dicarboxypentadecoic acid and for the sake of brevity will be referred
to throughout as Substance “ A.”

It is worthy of mention here, as a further example of the extraordinary specificity
