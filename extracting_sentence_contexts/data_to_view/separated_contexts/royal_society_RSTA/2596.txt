The
researches of Gouy} and Cuauvry§ show that in the case of Iceland spar the effects of
double refraction and magnetic rotation are simply superposed. Now CHAUDIER|| has
established that the magnetic rotatory power disappears completely during the
crystallization of aniline, benzene, and nitrobenzene (all of which have been investigated
in Part I.). If this is a true discontinuity of the magnetic rotatory power, apart from
any effect due to double refraction, then we can use this fact to obtain an estimate of
