Madras —Hours of Maximum and Minimum Temperature.

The usual impression in India is, that the maximum heat occurs about 2 p.m., and
the minimum a little after snnrise. The Madras hourly observations for four years,
from which the following Table is prepared, exhibit great anomalies in the hours of
the occurrence of the maxima and minima, In the forty-eight months of monthly
range there are seventeen records of the greatest heat occurring about noon (between
11) 41» and 12! 41”); eighteen records between 1 and 2 Pp.m., and thirteen records
between 2 and 3 p.m. In 1842 the maximum daily heat occurred only once about noon
(12% 41”) on the 20th of April (96*5). In 1843 it occurred at the same hour, or be-
fore it, in January, February, March, May and November. In 1844, at the same
hour, in January, April, November and December. In 1845, in March, April, May,
September, October, November and December; $0 that in fact the maximum
daily heat, although it took place only at noon in the month of April in 1842, in the
other three years, either in one year or the other, occurred at noon in all the months.
There is not a single instance of the maximum daily heat occurring after 2" 41” p.m,
The minimum heat of the month, in 1842, occurred in May at 2b 41” a.m. (811),
the only record of the kind in the year. In 1843*there is no similar record, but
in 1844 there are two instances of the least heat taking place in July and August
at 41” past midnight, and one instance at 2" 41” 4.m, in September. In 1845
there is a solitary case of the lowest temperature at 2% 41” a.m. In the whole
four years there are only three instances of the minimum heat being at 3 41” a.m.,
two at 4" 41” a.m., twenty-five at 5" 41” A.M., and twelve at 6* 41” a.m.; and one
sIngular instance of the greatest cold in the month being as late as 7" 41” a.m. on
the 14th of May 1844. It may be affirmed, therefore, that the greatest cold occurs
