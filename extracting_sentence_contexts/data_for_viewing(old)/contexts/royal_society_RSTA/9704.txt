where the numbers n, are integral. In the form (8) each of the » elements on the
right-hand side corresponds to a different one of the n branches. In the », elements
corresponding to the conjugate branches of the cycle of order », substitute for the
coeflicients @ corresponding conjugate series beginning with a term in (z—a)”™, or 2-™™,
Do this for each of the 7 cycles and the resulting function H (z, ~) will have precisely
the set of orders of coincidence 7,, ..., 7, here in question, and will at the same time
evidently be of rational character for the value z = a (or z = ©),

Not only can we construct a function H (z,~) of rational character for the value
z =a (or z=), which possesses the arbitrary set of orders of coincidence 7, ..., tT,
but we can in particular construct a rational function of (z,w) which’ possesses
precisely this set of orders of coincidence for the value of the variable in question.
To obtain such a rational function, in fact, it evidently suffices in the function H (z, u),
already constructed, to cut off in the series in powers of z—a (or 1/z), which constitute
the coeflicients of the powers of ~, terms of order sufficiently high to be unaffected by
the orders of coincidence 7,, ..., 7,, required of the function.

Let us now suppose for the moment that the equation (1) has reference to the
value z=, so that the coefficients f,_,, ...,,f are series in powers of 1/z involving,
it may be, a finite number of positive powers of z. The aggregate degree of the
equation in (z,) we shall indicate by the letter N. Referring to the identities (7),
then, we see that the degrees of the functions Q,(z,) can in no case exceed N—1,
If now the function H(z,w) in (8) be adjomt for the value z=, the lowest
exponents in the series 6,(1/z) must, as we have already noted, be >—1, and the
degrees in z of these series must therefore all be <1. The degrees in (z,w) of the
