The activity of the fish has great influence on the result. Occas
obtained from sluggish fish a nerve organ response with a very slight, barely percepti
secondary effect, only revealed by close rheotome analysis. This was not due to:
fact that the primary response was of less intensity, but was evidently depend
upon the diminished excitability of the tissue ; since in excitable tissue obtained fr
vigorous fish a well-marked secondary response occurred following minimal excitat
of the nerve. The following experiment shows a maximal and a minimal effect :
