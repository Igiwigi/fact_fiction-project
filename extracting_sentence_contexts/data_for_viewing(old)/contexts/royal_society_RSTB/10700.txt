complexes before (a) and after (b) binding of EF-Ge GDPNP (a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue) [26]. The L1 stalk of the 50S subunit is ‘open’ before (a) and closed
after (b) binding of EF-G. (c) Conformational change of L1 stalk, which moves the tRNA from P/E (b) into E/E (a) position. Landmarks: L9, ribosomal protein L9; L2,
protein L2; H76, helix 76 from the 23S rRNA; L1, L1 protuberance or stalk in the 50S subunit. (Reproduced with permission from [26].)

to E, respectively, together with the advance of the
mRNA bound to the tRNAs by one codon. The precise func-
tion of GTP hydrolysis on EF-G/eEF2 in this process is
still controversial, and it may not be strictly coupled with
the second stage of translocation [32].

Heterogeneity stems from the fact that often multiple states of
the molecule are present, all differing in structure, so that a
reconstruction from all projections will be a blurred super-
position of several structures, representative of none. As a
remedy, it is possible to use antibiotics or non-hydrolysable
GTP analogues to trap the molecule in particular states.
Antibiotics are typically small molecules that bind to a func-
tional centre and disable its dynamical features [33].
