a model-based optimization with an edge-preserving hyperbola regularizer. By comparing the
images for each material, it is possible to clearly note how the Denoising-IHS approach is able to
separate each material and reduce the noise in the reconstruction, as can be seen in particular for
the water and iodine. The iodine image in figure 3c indicates that algorithm [14] does not manage
to fully separate the iodine and gadolinium materials.
Figure 4a shows the comparison between the root-mean-square error (RMSE), i.e.
/(1/N)(x â€” x*) of the vector x containing the concatenation of the estimated materials with
respect to the ground truth x* between the OS-PWSQS algorithm and the proposed algorithm.
The solution achieved by the two algorithms is different because the cost function, both data
fidelity term and regularizer, that OS-PWSQS [14] aims at minimizing is different from (3.1). By
analysing figure 4a, it is possible to highlight that the Denoising-IHS algorithm achieves a more
accurate solution. Looking in detail at the blue curve, it is possible to note some local plateaus
with sudden reduction of the error, and this is in agreement with the fact that in the outer loop
the divergence of the denoiser is calculated to update the ridge leverage scores (6.1) which has
a cost equivalent of applying the denoiser as stated in (6.2). Furthermore, figure 4b shows the
comparison in objective function between the convergence plot (semi-log) in dB of the Denoising-
THS algorithm and the solver which consider the full Hessian of the data loss at each iteration.
This plot highlights how the strategy for block sub-sampling of the Hessian leads to a notable
reduction in computation (almost 2.2 times) while both reach a similar minimum value in the cost
