To this may be added the corresponding relation obtained from the forms U", V",
W', T". These added to the former conditions give us 32 +2=34.

Tt was however remarked at the outset that the equations UP'—U'"P=0, &e., are
lineo-linear in the U coordinates, and also in the U” coordinates ; and as we are con-
cerned with the ratios only of the coefficients, and not with their absolute values, we
are in fact concerned only with the ratios of the U coordinates inter 8, and with
those of the U "coordinates inter 8c, and not with their absolute values. Hence the
number of independent coordinates will finally be reduced to

48—34 —2=12,
as it should be,
