Some discussions about future missions to an ice giant planet have focused on the question,
‘Uranus or Neptune?’ It is important to recognize the fundamental limitation of a mission to just
one of the ice giants: a Neptune mission will tell us very little about the Uranus system, and vice
versa. Even if the planets themselves are superficially similar, their planetary systems are not. This is probably related to the fact that the Uranus system we see is, in some manner, original,
whereas the Neptune system is not. It is understandable that, in a world with limited resources,
a choice will need to be made. However, we will never obtain a complete understanding of ice
giants until both of these bodies have received the close scientific scrutiny that they deserve.
