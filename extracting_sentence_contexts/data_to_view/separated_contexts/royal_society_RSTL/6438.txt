With one sharp and one flat electrode placed near together, bright sparks passed
when the connexion was metallic, and the invisible spectrum then showed the copper
lines, with one or two air-lines not conspicuous ; but when water was interposed the
spark was greatly reduced, and the invisible spectrum showed the air-lines. In both
cases the spark was followed by an arc discharge, as might be seen in a moying mirror ;
and in the latter case the arc discharge was increased in consequence of the diminution

of the spark, which, though necessary to start it, was formed at its expense; and as in
the arc discharge the jar was idle, the increase of resistance in a circuit already com-
prising the secondary coil was unimportant. The fact that the blue negative light which appears when the arc discharge is formed
shows air-lines, points to the air as the seat of the intense action which there takes
place; and the very high refrangibility of some of the rays emitted, and the copiousness
of those rays, indicate how intense that action is. The heating of the negative electrode
s8eems to be a secondary effect, not due to the direct passage of the electricity through
the metal (for the section through which it passes is not by any means small), but to
the heat communicated from the film of air investing it. Small as is the mass of the
film compared with that of the portion of the electrode adjacent to it, the rate at which
heat is communicated is enormous.
