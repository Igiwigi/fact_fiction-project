reality a post-gastrula stage. The supporters of this view differ among themselves
in certain points and their views can be classed into two groups, viz.,

(a) Older biphased gastrulation theory. This was first clearly put forward by
Heymons (1895 and 1901). According to him, insect gastrulation occurs in two
phases of which the first is represented by the separation of the primary yolk cells
(intravitelline separation), and the second by the inward migration of secondary
yolk cells from the primary epithelium (circumpolar separation). The differentia-
tion of the inner layer is not regarded as a part of gastrulation. Parren was also
of this opinion and says (1890, p. 368), ‘‘ That the median furrow of insects is merely
an ontogenic adaptation is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present
or absent in closely related forms”. According to this view, the yolk cells alone
represent the endoderm. But since they eventually degenerate, there is, among the
Pterygote insects, no true endoderm sharing in the formation of the adult body.
The mid-gut epithelium is of ectodermal origin. This view has been supported by
Lécamton (1897-8), ScHwarrze (1899), and the majority of those authors who
regard the mid-gut epithelium as ectodermal in origin.

(b) Newer biphased gastrulation theory. This view also maintains insect gastru-
lation to occur in two phases. The first phase corresponds to the first phase of the
older view discussed above. But the second phase is represented here by the
differentiation of the inner layer and the inwandering of the yolk cells from the
primary epithelium. Thus, there is, among insects, no blastula stage and therefore
