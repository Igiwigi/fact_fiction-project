removal of the specula from the oven; the ordinates are the degrees of the galyano-
meter. The temperature of A when removed was 70?, about 5* above the air, that of B
was 72%, about 20Â® above the air. The oven, when they were introduced, was believed
to be between 900* and 1000.)

The irregularities in these curves are probably due to changes in the masses of iron
which were in the vicinity of the galvanometer. The equatorial was about 200 feet
distant, and underwent little change at this time; but other parts were in process of
construction at about 60 or 70 feet distance.

[Some facts as to the time of grinding the speculum A may be useful. It was com-
menced October 27. In four hours two-thirds of the surface was in action; in fourteen
the whole surface was working, a proof how truly it had been cast. On October 29 a
small hollow, 0-25 inch diameter and 0-043 inch deep, was made by a copper drill and
emery. When measured next morning the amount ground off was known. This was
repeated daily, and it was found that
