IMPACT assumes world commodity equivalents of Bl and B2, but were only able to solve
prices equilibriate each year and the increased demand for IMPACT assuming producers in other countries respond to
rice from the affected countries will tend to increase global higher demand by planting more rice. This solution failure
rice prices. This increase in prices will affect consumption reflects the fact that IMPACT, like all market equilibrium
patterns in countries beyond those immediately affected by models, cannot accurately represent major perturbations
the pathogen epidemic. They may also influence producers where it is unreasonable to assume markets equilibriate
in non-affected countries to switch to growing more rice. To over an annual timescale.

explore this we ran two versions of scenario B, the first (B1)

response to the epidemic and the second (B2) that it does. (c) Results
