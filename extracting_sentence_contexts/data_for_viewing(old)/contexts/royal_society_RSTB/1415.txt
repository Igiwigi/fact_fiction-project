of the branch, from its base upwards. Such casts, when perfect, invariably
at their lower extremity in a very narrow conical point, on which no traces

tables, is designated the proto-medulla of the branch, .c., the basal portion
y which it was connected with that of the parent stem.
tables give the length and circumference of each internode, as well as the
its woody wedges (vascular bundles); in all these respects an increase

the point where this increase is checked, which is usually within a few
Pom the conical base of the pith of the branch, the latter is prolonged to a
less considerable height, with very little further change in the features
