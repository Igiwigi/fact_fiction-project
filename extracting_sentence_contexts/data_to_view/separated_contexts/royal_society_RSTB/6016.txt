In general no indication is given, visible under an ordinary
microscope, of the direction of the cellulose fibrils in the wall. Now even a very
thin section can, in general, contain only walls of a three-ply nature, the cellulose
walls of two neighbouring cells being separated by some material possibly of a pectic
nature. Thus the extinction positions already referred to lie along the bisectors of
the angle between those of the individual walls, and no information can be obtained
as to the extinction positions of the individual walls ; in fact, no true extinction is
obtained in any position of the microscope stage. When the two cells have the same
spiral sign the cellulose chains run in opposite directions in the two walls, and the
extinction positions are approximately parallel and perpendicular to the length of
the cell. Any such section does, in fact, show a few single walls as indicated by their
more perfect extinction and by the inclination of their extinction positions, but the
number is far too small for present purposes.
