The above facts and remarks would also show that a comparison between different
gunpowders, or a comparison between gunpowder and other explosive agents cannot,
as has been proposed,+ be determined by a simple measurement of the corresponding
units of heat they evolve. Did such a law hold, the Spanish powder should have more than 50 per cent. advantage over the mining powder, but as a matter of fact, although not very widely
different, the mining powder had the advantage both in respect to the tension observed
in a close vessel and to the energy developed in the bore of a gun. As regards the actual temperature of explosion, we have little doubt, from the
results of the further experiments detailed in this paper, that the temperature named
in our first memoir, viz., 2200* C., is not far removed from the truth for the principal
powders with which we were then experimenting. * Loc. cit., p. 88.
