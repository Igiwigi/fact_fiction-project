notwithstanding the greater size of the Macropodide their brain index is smaller,
the brain tending to a rounder form on account of its greater quantity, to be kept within
a limited space. The same holds good for Dolichotis patagonica whose cephalisation
coefficient is about twice that of Cavia (aperea, the wild form of cobaya).

The Ungulates mentioned in my list did not differ very much in body weight, but the
cephalisation coefficient in the goat is about one and a half times that of the donkey,
and twice as large as that of the pig. Accordingly the goat’s brain is more brachycephalic
than that of the pig, while the donkey’s brain even has an index of 95.

Of the Carnivores mentioned Ursus malayanus has the largest cephalisation coefficient
((0-75), about twice as large as in Viverride and dogs and one and a half times larger
than in the Nasue). In harmony with this is the fact that notwithstanding the taller
body size of Ursus its brain-index is larger than that of the other Carnivores mentioned
in the table.

* To make the comparison accurate the animals should not differ in body size. It is very difficult to find
animals of exactly the same size and order differing exclusively in cephalisation coeflicient. The list in
Table II gives the best examples I could obtain. As body increase tends to diminish the brain index
(vide supra) the influence of the cephalisation coefficient is still more evident in those of my cases, where
—notwithstanding a taller body—the brain index is larger.
