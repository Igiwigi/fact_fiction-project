DV I think there can be little doubt that the innermost cortical layer, prolongations of which invest all the
Syascular bundles proceeding from the medullary vascular sheath to the periphery, must be regarded as the
homologue of what Sacns, following NxceLr and Lerrees, has termed the procambian layer in living Lycopods,
Sand which, as we $hall sce, reappears in Stigqmaria.
= The important truth demonstrated by the specimen in the Manchester Museum, and one with which all the
Sother specimens that I haye mentioned appear to harmonize, is, that the projecting tubercles of ZHalonia and
HUlodendron were confined to the inner prosenchyma of the bark, of which they were conical extensions
Jsurrounding and accompanying a fibro-yascular bundle on its way outwards to the surface, but that they did not
Sappear in any marked form, if at all, save as a scar, on the exterior of the plant. No such tubercular provision
"was made for the very numerous leaf-bundles, and we have abounding proofs that the tubercles had nothing
Sto do with the ordinary branches of the plant. It appears to me that nothing remains with which we can
AQassociate them but strobili, and with these T believe them to have been connected, Eyery new fact that we
discoyer appears to me to bring the two genera Halonia and Ulodendron into nearer relationship than has hitherto
been recognized. I have very little doubt that the Zalonice were young branches sustaining rows of cones :
after the cones fell off, they would leave permanent cicatricule impressed upon the bark, and which would
enlarge as the stems increased in magnitude, the latter process being probably accompanied by the development
of an exogenous zone around the medullary cylinder. Specimens of these old and matured fruiting stems
may exist among what we have hitherto termed Ulodendra.
