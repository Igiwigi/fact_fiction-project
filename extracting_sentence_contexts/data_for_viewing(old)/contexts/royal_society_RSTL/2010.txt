The original register of the whole is preserved and can
easily be referred to, should any of the observed phenomena,
beyond those which are here given, be considered likely to
have influenced the motion of the needles. As far, however,
as our own observations extended, we have reason to believe
that on no occasion were the needles in the slightest degree
affected, either by the aurora, meteors, or any other percep-
tible atmospheric phenomenon.

Soon after the observations were commenced, it was ascer-
tained that twice in every four and twenty hours the needles
moved past a certain point, which may be denominated the
zero, or mean magnetic meridian ; a fact, which was first
rendered clearly apparent, from the accompanying diagrams
already mentioned, by which it appears that in every instance
except one, both needles every day passed the line in ques-
tion. On a single day, February 24, the needle No.2 did
not arrive at it during its eastern motion.

The means of the times of the needle passing this zero, as
deduced from four months continued observations, is, 615”
A. M:, and 4* 37” P. M. ; the mean time in.each month being
as follows :
