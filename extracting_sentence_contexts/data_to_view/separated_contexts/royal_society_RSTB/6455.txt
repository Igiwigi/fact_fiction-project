According to most investigators (SNopGRAss, 1935, p. 411), the oenocytes
originate in the embryo from the ectoderm at places just posterior to the spiracles
in the first eight segments. Thus the association of the oenocytes with spiracles is
purely incidental and has no morphological significance. As a matter of fact, the
oenocytes are ectodermal in origin and their presence in the ninth abdominal seg-
ment in which the spiracles are absent clearly indicates that the formation of oeno-
cytes is not confined to any particular part of the ectoderm, as is often considered to
be the case. They are smaller than the surrounding fat cells, being only 21-29 Â»
in the larger diameter. Their number on each side of a segment varies from five to
eight.
