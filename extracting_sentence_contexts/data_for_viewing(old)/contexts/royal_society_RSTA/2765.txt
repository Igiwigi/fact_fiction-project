feasibility approach as well. Add that any ethical approach, at least in the EU, accepts, as its
minimal starting point, the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
Union. And the result is that the space of soft ethics is both partially bounded, and yet unlimited.
To see why, it is easy to visualize it in the shape of a trapezoid (figure 2), with the lower side
representing a feasibility base that is ever-expanding through time—we can do more and more
things thanks to technological innovation—the two constraining sides, left and right, representing
legal compliance and human rights, and the open upper side representing the space where what
is morally good may happen in general and, in the context of this article, may happen in terms of
shaping and guiding the ethical development of our mature information societies.

Talready mentioned that hard and soft ethics often go hand in hand. Their distinction is useful
but often logical rather than factual. In the next section, I shall analyse their mutual relation and
their interaction with legislation by relying on the specific case provided by GDPR. In this section,
a final clarification is in order.

When distinguishable, soft digital ethics can be more easily exercised the more digital
regulation is considered to be on the good side of the moral versus immoral divide. Thus, it
would be a mistake to argue for a soft ethics approach to establish a normative framework
when agents (especially governments and companies) are operating in contexts where human


rights are disregarded, e.g. in China, North Korea or Russia. In other contexts, when human
rights are respected, hard ethics may still be necessary to change some current legislation that is
perceived to be ethically unacceptable. The Irish abortion referendum in 2018 is a good example.
