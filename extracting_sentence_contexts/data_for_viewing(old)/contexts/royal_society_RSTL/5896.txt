11827, in which he combated Vox Bucn's theory of © Erhebungskratere,” that the
| <p earthquakes which accompany eruptions and are connected with the injection
f lava from below, imply the expansion of the solid framework of the cone, but he still
insisted on the doctrine that © the parallel and sloping beds which with a quaquaversal
dip compose every volcanic cone, were not originally deposited horizontally, or other-
wise than at a high angle of inclination, and the angular elevation they have since
sustained is in general comparatively trifling*.” Yet neither Mr. ScroPe nor I, when
we ascribed a volcanic cone to the cumulative effect of reiterated eruptions, claimed any
originality for 80 obvious an explanation of the phenomena. For true it is, as M. EL1E
BravMoNnT had remarked, that © Philosophers and geologists, who from the time of
Ihe Greeks to our own days have seen Etna, covering its flanks with new beds of ashes.
Scorize and lava, have admitted, almost without examination, and as a self-evident fact,
at the entire mountain is simply the result of the gradual addition one over the other
2 elements mutually similar, and all resembling the products of the eruptions which

ey themselves have witnessed ” (ib, p. 101).

5 After the publication of the memoirs above cited of MM. DurResNoY and E. ps Beav-
For, all geologists who implicitly acquiesced in the doctrine laid down by them as to
Ahe law which governs the consolidation of lava, became, almost unavoidably, converts
Zo Vox Bucn's hypothesis ; for it was not only necessary to admit a vast amount of
Fpheaval, but to assume that the whole of it had in each volcano been posterior in
Mate to the outpouring of all, even the latest of the highly-inclined lavas, found in
Sach cone.
