loads for thin shells can be as low as 20% of the load for a perfect shell. These facts are well known
and there is a large experimental and theoretical literature going back almost 75 years addressing
the subject, especially for cylindrical shells under axial compression.

Starting with the work of von Karman & Tsien [1] and Tsien [2], a major effort was made to
come to terms with the catastrophic nature and imperfection sensitivity of the buckling of elastic
spherical shells by studying the post-buckling behaviour of the perfect shell, with parallel efforts
on cylindrical shells under axial compression. Criteria involving load-carrying capacity and/or
energy in the post-buckling state were proposed to explain the low buckling loads measured in
tests and to serve as a guide for safe design. While the studies clearly exposed the source of the
catastrophic buckling behaviour, the approaches based on behaviour of the perfect shells have not
yet been particularly successful in yielding quantitative predictions of imperfection sensitivity.
