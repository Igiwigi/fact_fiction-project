initial parabolic region is neglected. Physical reasons for this type of similarity are not
obvious, for the rate of transfer of energy from eddies of wave-number less than k to those of
wave-number greater than / becomes negligible as k approaches zero, even considered as
a fraction of the total energy in these wave-numbers, and, in fact, the invariant Ck* range is
a reflexion of this disappearance of the inertial transfer term. In the absence of inertial
transfer of energy between the range and the energy-containing range, it is difficult to see
how the invariant range can impose a scale-velocity relation on the main body of the spec-
trum. However, the hypothesis has been used by Kolmogoroff (19416) and Frenkiel (1948)

to deduce the decay law Poe

This decay law is not valid in the initial period, but Karman & Lin (1949) have suggested
that it may be true in the intermediate period of decay (Batchelor & Townsend 1948 a).
