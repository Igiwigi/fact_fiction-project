5 And with regard to dihydroxymethane, CH,(OH),, there is little doubt but that
© at high temperatures it is ultimately resolved into carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and
-4 steam, as follows :—

3 H H

5 H:-C:-OH = H:C:0+H,0
3 (GEREN

Ss OH CO+H,. iS

= If now, the above facts be combined with the corresponding thermal changes,

é expressed in kilogram-centigrade units per gram-molecule, the scheme for the primary
a oxidation of methane may be represented as follows :—
