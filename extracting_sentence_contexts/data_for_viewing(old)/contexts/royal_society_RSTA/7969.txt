liquid air.

Most striking of all the former results was the behaviour of the iron-nickel
alloys containing 5 or 6%, of manganese and from 0-6 to 1+2%%, carbon. This range of
alloys was previously known as exceptional for their remarkable ductility at ordinary
temperature. The alloy with 24-30%, nickel has a tenacity of 51 tons and an elongation
of 60%. The specially noticeable point concerning the properties of this alloy at the
temperature of liquid air is that this high ductility is actually increased, namely, from
60 to 67%. This range of alloys is not permanently transformed, the original tensile
properties being restored unaltered on return to normal temperature. with no change
in the specific magnetism or dimensions.

Finally, among the curious facts noted was that for all those alloys containing nickel,
whose ductility was undiminished or even increased in liquid air, the reduction in area
at the fracture was appreciably diminished, as an average by about 50%. Thus, while
maintaining the extent of their total elongation before fracture, these alloys do so with
a distinct change in behaviour; that is, through a more uniform extension along the
length of the test specimen, and less localized in the neighbourhood where fracture
oceurs.

With these interesting facts on record regarding the behaviour of iron and ferrous
alloys at a temperature of — 182° C., it was a natural desire to explore, when oppor-
tunity occurred, still lower down the temperature scale. With the larger supplies of
liquid hydrogen (— 252-8°) now available, owing to the progress made at Leiden in
the production and maintenance of specially low temperatures, it was considered
