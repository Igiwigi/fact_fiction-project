Pholidogaster, Cricotus, and those referred by Frrrscu to Macromerium. In none
of these does the ilium show any marks of attachment to the sacral ribs.

This type of pelvis is entirely appropriate to the sacral arrangement of Eogyrinus.
The long sacral ribs of that form lay below the elongated ilium, and that element
was attached to them by muscles exactly as the scapula is attached to the pectoral
ribs.

D.M.S.W. 28, part of the type individual of Kogyrinus, retains a femur. This bone is
considerably crushed, lacks part of its distal end, and is exposed from the dorsal and
partly from the ventral surface. It has a semicircular head, set straight on the end
of the bone, and of slight thickness, so that the articular face is shallow. The shaft is
rounded, there being no pronounced adductor crest as in Eryops. The bone is, in fact,
rather strikingly like the femur of Dimetrodon.
