They also
resemble the sheaths of Neumann in being resistant to the action alike of acids and
of alkalis. Whether, like the dentinal tubes, they consist of a resistant sheath containing a
softer fibril, or whether they wholly consist of the resistant material, has not been
shown; but, although the enamel tubes are larger than those of the dentine, it is
dificult to get coloured fluids to enter them. It might have been supposed that it would be a very simple matter to determine
the position of these tubes in completed enamel, and to say whether they lay in the
interior of the prisms or between them, but as a matter of fact it proved to be very
difficult. For in proportion as the tube system is highly developed, so do the enamel prisms
cease to be distinct ; indeed, they can hardly be seen at all in those parts of the tooth
where the tube system is richly present. In addition to this, the tubes, like the tubes of dentine, and, indeed, like most
enamel prisms, pursue a spiral course, like a corkscrew pulled out until it is nearly
straight; hence, even in very thin sections, they appear to wind about with the smallest
alteration of focus of the microscope.
