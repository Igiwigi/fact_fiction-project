field perturbations, thus producing foot-point heating [165]. The recent application of forward
modelling techniques to waves by Antolin & Van Doorsselaere [166], Antolin et al. [167] and De
Moortel et al. [168] shows great promise.


(b) Seismology inversion from observed wave properties

In parallel with theoretical and observational advances, the field of solar atmospheric seismology
has emerged. The term refers to the study of the physical conditions in solar atmospheric magnetic
and plasma structures from the analysis of the observed wave properties. It was first suggested
by Uchida [56] and Roberts et al. [57] in the coronal context, and by Roberts & Joarder [169] in
the prominence context. The aim is to increase our knowledge about the complicated structure
and dynamics of the solar atmosphere and is based on the fact that the properties of the observed
oscillations are determined by the plasma and magnetic field properties.

Solar atmospheric seismology has experienced a great advancement (see [24,50,52,53,170,171
for reviews). This was made possible by the increase in the quantity and quality of wave activity
observations and the refinement of theoretical MHD wave models.

Local seismology, based on the use of simplified models for the magnetic and plasma
structuring of tube-like waveguides and observations of the period and damping of standing and
propagating waves, enabled us to obtain information on the magnetic field strength [172,173],
the coronal density scale height [174,175], the magnetic field expansion [176], the Alfv√©n speed
[81,177] or the longitudinal and cross-field magnetic field and density structuring [178-181]. This
information is crucial to evaluate the time and spatial scales for wave damping and dissipation
