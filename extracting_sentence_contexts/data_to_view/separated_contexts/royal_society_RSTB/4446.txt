This feature, as suggested by Mrs. Arper, is probably correlated
with the erect position of the seed, exception being made, of course, in those cases
where an inclined ovule with an asymmetrical epimatium subsequently becomes
erect, as in Dacrydium. In Acmopyle, too, the epimatium is symmetrical, at least
in the major portion of the seed—a fact which, by the way, would seem to suggest |
that the young stage of the ovule is probably not much more inclined than the ripe
seed, or at least not completely inverted.

* Since the above was written IT have been able to confirm their absence in this species from
Mrs. Arper’s original preparations, which she most generously placed at my disposal for comparison.

evidently a misprint. AFFINITIES OF ACMOPYLE PANCHERI, PILGER. 291
