The noble gas (isotopic) compositions of 67P have the potential to offer further constraints
on the role of comets in the development of the surface layers of planets like the Earth. These
are difficult measurements to make and are, in fact, still being acquired. Initial results from
argon are given in Balsiger et al. [11] and confirm the fact that comets like 67P were not a
significant contributor to water on Earth. However, it may transpire that isotope ratios can be
used to constrain the relative inputs of noble gases to the different surface reservoirs on the
planet (e.g. the atmosphere as distinct from the hydrosphere). This is important because it gives
insights into the significance of comets in delivering species other than water to the surface of
the early Earth.
