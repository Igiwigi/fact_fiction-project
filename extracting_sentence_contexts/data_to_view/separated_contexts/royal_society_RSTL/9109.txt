Kidder
E describes the nestlings as follows :—*© The down of the young bird is entirely grey
3 * in colour; the head is partly naked, and the hill, tarsi, and feet are coloured
Z © nearly as in the adult, but s0mewhat paler. The firs: fully-formed feathers are
& © similar to the adult plumage.” At the same time Dr. Kidder seems not to have
Z noticed any white specimens, and that these are rare near the Cape is proved by the
E fact that Mr. Layard (7. c.) states that the species is common in Table Bay through-
E out the year, and that © a white variety is common up the west coast towards
& © Walwisch Bay.”
2 In the Britich Musenm are specimens from Wellington, New Zealand (Dy.
2 Hector), and the South Pacific Ocean, as well as one from the present locality.
