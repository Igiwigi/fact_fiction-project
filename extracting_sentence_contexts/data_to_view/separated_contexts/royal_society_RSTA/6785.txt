Now if we suppose for the moment that the part of the breakwater to the left of the gap
(i.e. for x< — 4b) is removed, we have the case of a semi-infinite barrier for which the solution
is given by (14). It has been seen that this solution may be analyzed into two parts, one of
which corresponds to the shadow and reflexion as given by geometrical optics, and the other
corresponds to diffraction waves diverging from the end of the barrier. In fact, on making
use of (19) and (21) as in §4 we can write the expression (14) for F(x, y) in the forms

F(x,y) =e" —f, +g, for x< 4b and for all y, (36)
=+fitg for x>4b and y>0, (37)

and 1, is the distance of the point (x, 4) from the end of the barrier (40, 0). The diffraction waves in the region x<}b, due to the barrier along the line segment
y = 0, x>4b, are represented by the terms —/,-++g, (= F; say) in the expression (36) for
F (x,y). From (39) and (40) we find that these diffraction waves satisfy the following con-
ditions along the unoccupied part of the x-axis:
