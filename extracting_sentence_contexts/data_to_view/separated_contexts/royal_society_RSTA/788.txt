The denomination ‘dynamical’ here does not intend to model any physical processes in
the brain substrate itself. Quantum-like modelling in cognition is essentially a phenomenological
approach that not only provides the kinematical evolution of states in a person’s belief space,


but also can detail the various transfers of these probability amplitudes. The denomination
‘dynamical’ captures the fact that, in the model, the cognitive evolution is driven by parameters in
the Hamiltonian and Lindbladian operators, which should be psychologically interpretable and
of which the relative parameter amplitudes can be used to assess the importance of constituent
transfer processes. The focus of the present work is cognitive QPT dynamical models. Notwithstanding their
descriptive success, it is typically the case that many simplifying assumptions are made when
specifying the relevant dynamical processes.
