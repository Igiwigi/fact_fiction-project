Figure 7. Experimental demonstration that some donut modes are in fact an incoherent superposition of odd and even petal :
Modes [20]. Two pinholes are moved through a donut beam and the resulting transmitted light was overlapped spatially with 24
a lens. When the pinholes transmit light from the same petal structure (odd/even mode), the overlap forms an interference ae
pattern (a).
