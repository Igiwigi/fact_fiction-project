It requires a little manceuvre to perform this experiment successfully : the
motions of the animal must be watched, and slowly and cautiously arrested by
opposing some s0ft suþbstance, as a glove or cotton wool ; they are by this means
gradually lulled into quiescence. If at this moment the figure Jast as8wumed
be sketched upon paper, and the animal be left, protected from external impres-
Sions, it will be found to retain the same identical form when all vitality has
ceased.

The slightest touch with a hard substance, the slightest stimulus, will, on the
other hand, renew the moyements of the animal in an active form. But that
this phenomenon does not depend upon sensation, is further fully proved by
the facts, that the position last assumed, and the stimuli applied, may be such
as would be attended by extreme or continued pain, if the sensibility were un-
destroyed: in one case the animal remained partially suspended over the acute

edge of the table ; in others the infliction of punctures, and the application of
a lighted taper, did not prevent the animal, still possessed of active powers of
motion, from passing into a state of complete and permanent quiescence.

The same observations were made upon various other animals—the turtle,
the viper (/ipera Berus), the toad (Bufo vulgaris), the frog (Rana temporaria),
