A very general
issue is the identification of the transfer mechanisms. Sequences have been identified in the HD that are necessary
for internalization and secretion. In fact the first identified

ox blocking peptide

Figure 2. Otx2 HP regulates visual cortex plasticity. (a) A temporal French Flag internalization sequence corresponds to the third helix of
models Otx2 function in PV cells of the visual cortex. Otx2 accumulates in PV the HD of Antennapedia (a fly HP) and is highly conserved
cells after eye opening in the mouse and opens a CP of heightened plasticity among all HPs.
