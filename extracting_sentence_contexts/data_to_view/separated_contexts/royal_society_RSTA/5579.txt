micrometric observation. This, in fact, corresponds, but not exactly, with the second
case mentioned above, where a gradual change of temperature is going on in the
surrounding space ; those parts of the apparatus that are massive will lag behind in
temperature more than the lighter and thinner parts, and, as was pointed out by
CavenptsH, this is especially the case in apparatus for measuring the Newtonian
constant of gravitation. The large lead balls are sure to be hotter or cooler than the
light rectangular box, and, when hotter, by warming the side of the box near to
them they set up a circulation, which, in the apparatus of CAvENpIsH, produced an
appearance of attraction, Tf it is supposed that after all has acquired a uniform temperature a slight change
occurs in the surrounding space, then the asymmetrical store of heat will, in the
case of a large apparatus, be n* times as great as in the other.
