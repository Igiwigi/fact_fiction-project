Then more than half of the orbital walls are cartilaginous (0.s.), and in the middle of
each gpace is the rather mall optic fenestra (TT.). The girdle-bone (fig. 8) is in rudiments right and left, and there is no mesethmoidal
hone. Each hony tract is composed of a large cochleate cranial part, separated by half
S its width from its fellow, and perforated by the orbito-nasal nerve, To this part there
AQ is a handle growing out at more than a right angle, and ending in an adze-shaped
S dilatation (fig. 8, pa.).
= The fact is that the arrest of the bone towards the middle—above and below—is
= accompanied with an overgrowth beyond the proper alz of this region, and the whole
= palatine tract, which has no ectostosis of its own, has become ossified from the ecto-
© ethmoidal, 80 that its three regions, ethmo-, pre-, and post-palatine, are all used up to
5 form the handle to this-curious © lateral ethmoid.” The well-developed roof and floor
2 of the naxal region (figs. 7 and 8) are entirely unossified ; there is a short prenasal (p.7.),
= the nostrils (e.n.) are almost tubular, and are defended by the normal valves (1.0.u./.). E: Below, the internal nostrils (4.7) are very wide apart, because of the breadth of the 8nb-
S naxal lamine (fig. 8); these end in broad ear-shaped angles, outside, and near the
= middle haye small apiculate pro-rhinals ( p.y.),

S The pterygo-quadrate region is feeble, and the well-shaped, and distinetly-jointed
JF pedicles (pd.), are a long distance apart. The pterygoid-bone ( pg.) has not ossified
= all the cartilaginons band (fig. 7); its forks are very short.
