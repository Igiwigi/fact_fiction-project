Society's Memoirs.

12. Secondly, as to the correction to the motion of the moon's node. The com-
parison, between an observed latitude of the moon (supposed near the node) and the
corresponding tabular latitude of the moon as calculated from Damorseav's tables,
gives in fact a comparison between the true argument of latitude and DamorsEau's
argument of latitude; and therefore it gives the sum of two corrections to two
different elements of Damoistav's tables; namely, the correction to DamorsRav's
longitude of the moon, and the correction to Damorstav's supplement of longitude of
moon's node. And when, from the groups of results, we infer the secular correction
to the motion of the argument of latitude, we have found the sum of two corrections ;
first, the secular correction to DamorsEav's mean motion of the moon, s8uch as will
best reconcile DamorsBav's longitude of the moon, unaffected by new inequalities,
with the observed longitude of the moon, during the period to which the reductions
apply; and, secondly, the secular correction to Damorsgav's regression of the node.

13. Now for the difference between Damotseau's longitude unaffected by new
inequalities, and the observed longitude, we must refer to the second column of the
table, Royal Astronomical Society's Memoirs, vol. xvii. p. 35; and, comparing the
first four numbers with the last four, we find the correction to DamotsEav's
motion of the moon during 38:1 years =â€”0":30.
