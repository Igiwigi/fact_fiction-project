Ry: @, 5300; 0, 21200; x, 42400; @, 115000. These adjusted forms of the double and triple correlation functions probably form an
adequate approximation to the asymptotic forms of these functions at very large Reynolds
numbers. The observed systematic decrease with increasing Reynolds number of the
invariant A/MÂ°U? is partially accounted for by the variation of f(r) (unadjusted) with
Reynolds number, but there is also a variation due to the fact that neither u2/U? nor
u?/U?(1--A) are completely independent of R,,. This difference is probably due to variation
of the drag coefficient of the grid at these comparatively low Reynolds numbers. ComPOsITE SPECTRUM OF TURBULENCE

Direct measurement of the spectrum is the most accurate method of determining the
spectral distribution of turbulent energy at large wave-numbers, but at very small wave-
numbers correlation measurements are more reliable.
