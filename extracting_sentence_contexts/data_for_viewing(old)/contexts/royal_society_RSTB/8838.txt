The original statement of Hamilton’s rule [1, pp. 354-355]
was based upon a verbal argument:

where Py represents the effect of a focal individual’s phenotype
(z) on its own fitness and Bs represents the effect of the pheno-
type of the individual with whom it interacts (z’) [18]. (Here, we
use notation that corresponds to [21,24] instead of [18] for con-
sistency with later sections.) Equation (2.5) is analogous to (2.3),
and in fact, the terms By and Bg are selection gradients; each is a
partial regression slope estimated while holding constant the
traits of a social interactant. Elsewhere [21,24], we have called
Bw the non-social selection gradient and Bg the social selection
gradient. This is consistent with Hamilton’s use of ‘social selec-
tion’ ([38], see also [39]) but should be distinguished from other
uses of the term [40,41]. Note that although equation (2.5) is
written from the perspective of an individual, the selection gra-
rB>C. (2.2) dients are population-level parameters. That is, each represents

Hamilton lent this simple statement extensive mathematical
support in a later paper [2], but the general conclusion
remained the same: fitness losses to an altruist must be com-
