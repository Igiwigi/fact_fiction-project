be Lithic oxide. But the term lithic is a gross solecism ;1 and I
trust that philological critics will find the name ouric or uric
oxide perfectly appropriate; for, if it be thought objectionable,
on account of the existence- of the matter in arthritic as well
as urinary concretions, still philology will allow-its admission,
as in other similar cases, x«r" «ox; it being found in greater
abundance, by far, in the urinary passages than in other situa-
tions; and therefore falling under common observation, as an
ingredient of the urine. If, however, the term lithic oxide; or
any other denomination; shall-obtain acceptance, I shall very
willingly adopt it.

It requires no sagacity, ina person acquainted with the facts
of the- preceding experiments, to perceive that they are appli-
cabletoavariety of uses in chemical investigation,and in the prac-
tice of physic. The latter I of course take no notice of in this
place; but, relative tothe former uses, I $hall particularly point
out, that we are now able not only to detect, in the easiest man-

ner, the presence of the minutest proportion of the above animal
oxide in urinary-concretions, and also in other substances, - but
even to determine its proportion to the other constituent parts,

» From these experiments, it now appears very doubtful whether the lithic acid of
