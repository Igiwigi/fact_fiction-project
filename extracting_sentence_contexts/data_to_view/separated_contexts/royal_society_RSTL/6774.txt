of it, and you think the contents of it worthy their
notice ; I beg you will be ſo.good as to communi-
cate it to them. The facts therein mentioned have

tegrity, Mr. /Thomlinſan's conjecture of the cauſe
of 'the leaves of trees appearing ſcorched after the
ſtorm, T believe to be true ; . having two. or. three
times myſelf obſeryed the fame in Suſſex, at a con-
fiderable diſtance from the ſea ; when all the hedges,
trees, and woods, . on the fide toward the ſea, have
had their leaves ſcorched, as if fire had paſſed over
them; and their oppoſite ſides from the ſea have
continued in full yerdure ; which frequently happens
in ſtorms from the ſouth-weſt ; and, upon taſting
their leaves, I have found them as falt, as if they had
been ſteeped in; brine, I am,
