outliers of this stock extend on the north coast as far as the Cape Nelson peninsula. I am now of the opinion that the middle of Orangerie bay should be regarded as the
western border of the district. :

In the following description of the Massim pipes I first deal with the southern
mainland area from Mullens harbour to East cape, and then the Massim archipelagos
are dealt with. It is, however, more convenient to describe in another section the pipes
of the north coast of Papua from East cape to the northern boundary, irrespective of the
fact that the stretch of coast from East cape to Collingwood bay is generally considered
as belonging to the Massim area. The influence of the Massim culture is slight in
Collingwood bay. The main interest of the Massim area from my immediate point of view is the fact
that when Europeans first visited the islands tobacco smoking appears to have been
unknown in all but a few districts, and in these its introduction was probably recent.
