surface. But though the mountain had lost in beauty and variety of colour, it had
gained in interest and impressiveness to the geologist. Every detail of cliff and scar
was visible froma distance. The Soufritre had been one of the beauties of the West
Indies, and travellers had come from far to gaze on its richly-wooded slopes, and
to see the marvellous lake which nestled in the crater on its summit. To-day it
looks more like a skeleton; the ribs of bare rock stand out everywhere plainly
to be seen.

In more than one respect the gorges on the mountain deserve the name of cations.
Some of them must be nearly 1000 feet deep, and they are often so narrow and
steep-sided as to render the country almost untraversable. We were told that along
the leeward shore there is an old Carib track, but communication is kept up entirely
by means of row boats. The mountain was very frequently ascended, in fact this was
one of the commonest pleasure trips for the inhabitants and tourist visitors. But, as
already mentioned, there was only one track, which served also as the main road from
Chateaubelair to Georgetown. After crossing the low ground it struck the slopes of
the hill and ascended along the knife-edges between the ravines. The road was fairly
good for a bush path in the West Indies, and horses could be ridden along most of the
way. As the valleys are radial, the ridges between them swept right up to the
edge of the crater, so that the track led up to the lip of the depression, then along it
for a short space, and down another spur to Lot 14 on the windward side. The slopes
on each side were often 40Â°, and sometimes still higher, and the back of the ridges so
narrow that in many places there was only width sufficient for the path. After the
eruption, the bush was all destroyed, and as the roots had served to hold the loose
