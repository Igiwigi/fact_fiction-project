Table 26 gives the threshold temperatures observed for ‘puffing off” for various masses of
dextrinated lead azide when heated in nujol, allowing one drop of nujol to every 10 mg. of
azide. These values are plotted in figure 26, and it will be seen that the values nearly coincide
with the self-heating curve calculated for Service azide. Dextrinated and Service azides are
structurally and chemically identical, and the liquid may possibly suppress any effect due to
the dextrin itself. The chief physical difference between the two azides is particle size, Service
azide comprising crystals 0-01 x 0-04mm., while dextrinated azide contains crystallites of

the order 10~* to 10-5 cm. (part II (1)). The main fact is that, in presence of nujol, dextrin-
ated lead azide behaves like any typical high explosive, and shows no real detonation until
larger masses are involved. At 330°C, 100mg. gave a violent ‘puff’ after a few seconds
induction period, but with scarcely any noise, and no damage to the tube. At a similar
temperature, 200 mg. gave a loud explosion, but the aluminium tube was quite undamaged.
With cyclonite or other high explosive, much the same behaviour would be observed. On
the other hand, with ordinary loose azide, the tube is completely shattered.
