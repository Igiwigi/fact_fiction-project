One test we were able to make which appears to us to be crucial. If the flame acts
by diselectrifying the sphere, then the same result should follow from letting the
sphere touch in its fall an earth-connected brush near the water, but such contact had
no observable effect whatever, and we therefore came to the conclusion that the action
of the flame was not an electrical discharging action at all. In this connection also may be mentioned two other facts: (1) That the flame had
no observable effect on a roughened sphere; and (2) that we could not detect any
accumulation of electricity when we let the sphere fall time after time through a tube
connected to an electroscope, to which tube the sphere could give up its whole charge
by touching a wire brush in the interior. Photographs of the Transition from “ Smooth” to “ Rough.” Having found that the splash passed by gradual transition from “smooth” to
“rough” as the height of fall of a polished sphere was increased, we decided to
obtain a photographie record of the process.
