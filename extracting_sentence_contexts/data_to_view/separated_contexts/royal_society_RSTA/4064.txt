After some time, however, the temperature
again begins to fall, and soon falls rapidly until about 568Â° is reached, when an
extremely steady temperature is indicated, and the alloy, if it has not done so before,
sets to a solid mass. These three points are the freezing points of the alloy. They
may, of course, be due to any exothermic changes going on in the crucible, such as
the breaking up of the alloy into conjugate liquids or to allotropic changes; but the
microscope has satisfied us that in the case of gold-aluminium we have only to do with
the separation of solids, in fact, that at each of the three observed points a new
substance begins to solidify. It will be seen that multiple freezing points, although frequent, are not universal ;
for example, the alloys Au,Al and AuAl, have only one freezing point. It is important to bear in mind that the diagrams of Curves 2 and 5 give a record of
all the freezing points observed, and contain more information than an ordinary
equilibrium curve.
