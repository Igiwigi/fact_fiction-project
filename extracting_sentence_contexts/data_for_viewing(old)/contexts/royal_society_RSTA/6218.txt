a Cauchy horizon is developed where the evolutions comes to an end (cf. figure 1, and Section
8 of [139]). This behaviour may be very clearly seen in type V models (which contain the open
FRWL universes), and the overall behaviour is very different from that occurring in the simplest
isotropic models for a variety of fluids. For Bianchi-type IX universes instead, we have the closed
universe recollapse theorem of R. M. Wald, which states that there do not exist any eternally
expanding Bianchi IX universes with matter satisfying the dominant energy condition, and has
non-negative average pressure [140].

There is however another type of singularity classification that is based on the work of
Choquet-Bruhat and stems from theorems giving sufficient conditions for causal g-completeness,
that is necessary conditions for the development of cosmological singularities (cf. [141], [142, ch.
8]). This leads directly to a complete dynamical classification for isotropic cosmologies into many
distinct types [143,144]. In fact, there are four types of this classification that are found to play
an important role in current models, as they appear commonly in dark energy universes with
phantom fluids [145].

This leads to a ‘zoo’ of cosmological singularities developing in finite time into the future,
already in the isotropic category, to say nothing about possibilities in more general homogeneous
universes. These singularities include not only the traditional ones discussed earlier (big bang
and big crunch) but many other types, such as big rips, sudden singularities, or very mild soft
ones, turnarounds, etc. (see [146] for a brief review). They can be studied by using generalized
power series [147,148], or the method of dominant balance [149], and further classified using the
notion of strength of singularities. These studies have provided a clear picture of the dynamical
behaviours possible, but are limited only in the isotropic category.
