H2O dissolved in the carbonate melt. Hydrous
melts were quenched from 750°C to transparent and
crystal-free glasses and were subsequently analysed
for water content before and after measuring Tg by
Author for correspondence: high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry.
The glass transition and limited fictive temperatures
as a function of the water content were determined
at 10K/min cooling/heating rates resulting in
Tg ranging from 245°C at nominally anhydrous
conditions to 83°C in the presence of 42mol% H20
in the glass. Through a generalized Gordon—Taylor
analysis, the factors k (7.27), kg (3.2) and the interaction
parameter A, (0.49) were derived. The limited fictive
