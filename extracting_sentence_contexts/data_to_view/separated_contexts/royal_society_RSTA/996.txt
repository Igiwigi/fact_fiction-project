This rheometer works in the imposed velocity mode and, in figure 3b, we have reported the
stress measured during a ramp of shear rate. We see that there is an abrupt jump of stress which
reaches 80 kPa; nevertheless, this stress does not remain at this high level but oscillates between
the flowing and jamming state and its amplitude increases with the shear rate. In this case, the
structure of the suspension manages to come back transiently to the flowing state, despite the fact
that the shear rate is above the critical one. We shall discuss this point in the section (ยง3) devoted
to the application of a magnetic field.

(b) Rheological model of the jamming transition

It is now quite well established that the DST is generated by the transition from lubricated to
frictional contacts as shown by numerical simulations [20]. The key parameter is the fraction of
