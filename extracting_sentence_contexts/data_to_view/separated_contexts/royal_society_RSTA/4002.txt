Another feature of these photographs. requires explanation. In figs. 18 and 19,
and more or less in most of the others, an irregular network of dark lines or channels
is seen to cover the surface, and these lines obviously have little or no relation to
the crystals. As a matter of fact, these lines are only found in specimens that have
been etched, and then annealed and re-etched. In such a case as figs. 3 and 4,
where only one etching has been applied, similar lines are seen to follow the inter-
erystalline boundaries. In that case they are simply “ corrosion channels” caused by
the action of the acid at the crystalline junctions.
