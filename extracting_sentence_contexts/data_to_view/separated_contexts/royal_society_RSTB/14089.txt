Live imaging and labelling of cumulus cells indicate that the cumulus cells disperse after
cumulus migration and end up at several locations in the opisthosoma [16,20,24]. The dorsal field (light olive green) significantly expands after stage 6, but it is currently
not known if the dorsal field cells spread over, intermingle or push back and replace the contra-orbital cells. This fact is indicated by the second question mark at the
border between the dorsal field and the contra-orbital cells. (d) Embryo at stage 8, nuclei visualized by 4â€™,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) counterstaining. The germ
band corresponds to the area with a high density of nuclei; in the dorsal field, the nuclear density is lower, and nuclei of the contra-orbital cells are far apart from each
other. Both dorsal field and contra-orbital cells are morphologically clearly separate from the germ band and therefore are usually regarded as extraembryonic tissue. (e)
Embryo at stage 9, nuclei visualized as in (d).
