the temperature gradually decline:
in such measure that by the end of September or the beginning of October it is nearl
equalized over Northern India. In the Central Provinces, indeed, and in Rajpootang
also at Calcutta and some other stations in Bengal, there is a slight rise of temperatur
in September just before the rapid fall sets in. To sum up the above facts briefly. The distribution of temperature in Norther
India presents three very distinct phases, corresponding to the three seasons alread
defined. In the cold weather two loci of minimum temperature are situated in th
Punjab and Upper Assam, and there is a secondary locus of abnormally low temperaturt
extending apparently from Bareilly to Benares.
