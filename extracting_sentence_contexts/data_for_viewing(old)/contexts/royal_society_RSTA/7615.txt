a surface charge, as is the case when the conductivity is uniform, Also the equation
(3, 1) indicates that, for these special distributions of x, the currents will flow in the

surfaces for which « is constant. Moreover, in such cases, the induced currents can be
determined by solving the above equations for A,, without further considering y. It
will, however, be noted that this does not imply that electrostatic effects are ignored ;

just inside the conductor simply because of this term, which represents the effect of the

electrostatic field of the surface distribution.

4. CONDUCTORS WITH SPHERICAL SYMMETRY

We shall now show that there is a solution of the above special form when the con-

ductor is a sphere, with « a function of the distance r from the centre. If there is such a
