The number of the cobezoutoids is I(m—1)
U(m—2), according as m is odd or even.

88. Consider any two quantics of the same order,

(a, ..Xz, 9)" (ﬆ .Xz, y)*
and introducing the new facients (X, Y), form the quotient of determinants,
| (@..Xz,9)", (@,..Xz,9)" hi v,y |
(a, ..XX, Y)", (, XX, Yy" | | X,Y
which is obviously an integral function of the order (m—1) in each set of facients 8

rately, and lineo-linear in the coefficients of the two quantics; for instance, if the t
quantics are

(a,6,c,dJa, y),
(z, 0, &, d'Xn, yY,
the quotient in question may be written ;
3(ab'—d'b), Bad—gde)  ad—d'd "fa, y£X, YY
Bad —dc), ad'—ad+900—0V'c), 3(bd'—0Vd)
ad'—d'd, 3(bd'—V'd) . 3(cd' —Cd)

The function 80 obtained may be termed the Bezoutic Pmanant of the two quantics.

89. The notion of such function was in fact suggested to me by BxzouT's abbrevia
process of elimination, viz. the two quantics of the order mz being put equal to zero,
process leads to (m—1) equations each of the order (m—1): these equations are noth
else than the equations obtained by equating to zero the coefficients of the differ
terms of the series (X, Y)"-" in the Bezoutic emanant, and the result of the eliminat
is consequently obtained by equating to zero the determinant formed with the ma
which enters into the expression of the Bezoutic emanant. In other words, this de
minant is the Reultant of the two quantics. Thus the resultant of the last-mentio
two cubics is the determinant
