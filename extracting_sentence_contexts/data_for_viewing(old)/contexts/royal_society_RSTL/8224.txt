The Querwand or Zwischenscheibe may probably be similarly explained ; for where it
appears the rows of rod-heads of adjacent series are 80 drawn away from one another by
the extension of the fibre that their bright borders are no longer blended, and a dim
line (in all probability rendered darker by interference) comes into view between then.
The argument in favour of the existence of a continuous membrane across the fibre.
drawn from the fact that indentations of the sarcolemma pretty constantly occur at
this place, loses its weight when we reflect upon the extreme delicacy of the sarcolemma.
and the necessity which must exist for it to follow any changes of shape which may
occur in the enclosed substance.
