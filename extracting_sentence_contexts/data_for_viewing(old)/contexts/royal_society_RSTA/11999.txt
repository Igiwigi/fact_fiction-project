tions which obtain along the boundaries of the dielectric region.

electrification in von Hetsuowrz’s crucial experiment might, however, be formally expressed on
system as due to energy terms of this mixed type, but, of course, extremely minute.

THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 731

The phenomena are thus accounted for on the hypothesis that the electric charge
na conductor consists of a distribution of discrete electrons over its surface. It
js true that the facts of electric vibrations on conductors show that these electrons
must be extremely mobile and sensitive to electric force; this is because of the very
strong charges involved in them, but it does not imply that when the conductor is
rotated, the electrons will slip backward over its surface and remain where they were,
owing to the electric inertia. They will not take up the motion of the conductor just
at once ; but there is no electrie foree which would tend to prevent that result, and
the same steady viscous agencies that produce electric resistance when a steady
‘current of electrons is flowing in a fixed conductor, will ultimately make them move
‘with the rotating conductor, after a time relatively long but probably absolutely very

Pdifficulties of pure electrodynamie theory that are not removed by the hypothesis of
moving electrons, to which, from the consideration of several distinct classes of
phenomena, and apart altogether from electrochemical theory, we have been com-
