Heisenberg found his formalism of QM by using the mathematical correspondence
principle, which allowed him to adopt the equations of classical mechanics, while changing the
classical variables. This was not exactly the first principle, because it depended on the equations
of classical mechanics, which one might prefer to be a consequence of fundamental quantum
principles. On the other hand, the principle was related to the fact that the observable parts
of measuring instruments are classically describable ‘circuits’, just as they are in Chiribella,
D’Ariano and Perinotti’s framework. Heisenberg needed new variables because the classical
variables did not give Bohr’s frequency rules for spectra, and the corresponding probabilities
or statistics. Heisenberg discovered, almost by a guess, that these rules are satisfied by, in


general, non-commuting matrix variables with complex coefficients, related to amplitudes, from | 2 |
which one derives, by means of a Born-type rule, probabilities or statistics for transitions

between stationary states, transitions manifested in spectra, observed in measuring devices.
