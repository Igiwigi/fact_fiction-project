of the work, nor does Experiment 11 differ in this respect, though in this instance
there were no variations in either the hyperpncea or CO, output during the work,
significant of lactic acid production. In Benepicr and CatTucartâ€™s experiments a
low respiratory quotient was also observed after exercise, and this was in some cases
found to persist for as much as several hours.

It is therefore far from probable that the sole cause of the low respiratory quotient

after work in these last two experiments is CO, retention, and what appears to us
more likely is that some at least of the diminution is due to the fact that when rest
is resumed proportionally less garbohydrate than fat is metabolised than in the pre-
liminary resting period owing to the depletion of carbohydrate during the work, a
suggestion which is in consonance with the views expressed by the Zuntz school and
by Benepicr and Caracarr. It is, however, rather a remarkable feature that the
fall of respiratory quotient after the stop of the work only becomes obvious in the
experiments with work of 1056 kg.m. per minute, though Experiment 6 with work of
704 kg.m. per minute actually led to a greater total output of energy, owing to the
longer duration of the work. In the experiments at 1056 kg.m. per minute, how-
ever, the work was done at a greater rate, and the average respiratory quotient was
at a higher level during the work, so the actual effect on carbohydrate metabolism
may have been greater. At first sight, one is liable to suggest that the high oxygen
consumption in the final steady period of Experiment 9 may indicate some trans-
