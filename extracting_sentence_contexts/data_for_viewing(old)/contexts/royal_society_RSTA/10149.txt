first column has the determining factor e az agtst zi, and the other columns have the same factor with the

- other cube roots of ago.

We may remark that this agrees with che results obtained for this equation by the ordinary methods
(ForsytH, “Linear Differential Equations,” § 99) under the assumption that ag240. We have shown
that this is a necessary condition for the existence of the subnormal form in the variable =i satisfying
the equation formally, unless we have also a2; =0.

If, however, ds2=0 and dy, 40, then, as we have seen above, the transformation =< will give us a
system admitting of 3 normal solutions; the equation for 4, is, in fact, (0,)® — 4a.,4,=0, giving 6;=0 or
+ 2am.

We see, in fact, that, when as2=0 and a; 40, the characteristic index of the original equation is 2, so
that there will be one regular form satisfying the equation, i.¢., an expression of the form 2°P (z).

TE a2, dq, are both zero, the equation is of Fuchsian type. Thus the normal or subnormal forms are
found in all cases.
