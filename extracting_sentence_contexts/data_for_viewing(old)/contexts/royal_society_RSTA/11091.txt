It has been suggested to the author that a comparison of the experimental results
with those of previous experimenters would be of interest, and for the sake of com-
parison, Hrry’s experimental results have been taken, as no others have been made
which enable even a small comparison to be made. It may be remarked, however,
that experiments such as those by Parenry,* or by Peasnopy and Kunnuarpr,t
though not undertaken with the same object as in the present ones, emphasise the
difficulty of obtaining accurate results in this class of experiments. As regards the
high values which have been obtained for the value of the specific heat under con-
stant pressure in superheated steam in the present experiments, though in view of
RuEGNAULT's experimental result of 0'4805 for the mean specific heat between 248° F.
and 430° F. they seem highly improbable, there is no direct evidence that a very
large variation in its value does not occur, what evidence exists tending in fact to
show that very large variations do actually occur; thus, DELarocue and Berarp}
found that Kp = 0°847, while recently the value 0°38 has been calculated for the
