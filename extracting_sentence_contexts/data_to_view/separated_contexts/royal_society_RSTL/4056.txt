All that part of the paper which is made to pass over the lit in the screen, by the
motion of the clock, becomes now therefore successively exposed to a strong light ;
and is consequently brought into a state which fits it to receive a dark colour on
being again washed with the usual solutions, excepting those small portions upon
which dark images of the lower parts of the pendulums of the electrometer are pro-
jected through the slit ; these small portions of course retain the light colour of the
paper; and form the long curved lines or bands, whose distances from each other
at any given part of the photograph (3.e.), at any given time, indicate the electric
tension of the atmosphere at that time. Sometimes, when daylight was used, various appearances of the a were noted
during the process, by which it would seem, that, in serene weather, when the sun's
light and heat varied, and the paper became consequently more or less darkened,
the electric tension, as shown in the photograph, varied also; increasing with the
increment of light, &c. This fact, has not perhaps been before obseryed : and some
attentive observations on the subject, made with the aid of a good actinometer, &C.,
are desirable. In order that the state of the electrometer itself may be known at any period of
the process, a small microscope is fitted to an aperture in the door of the long case,
opposite to the slit in the screen, and arrangements are made whereby the eye may
be applied to- it, and to view the images through the semitransparent photographic
paper, without damage by the admission of extraneous light.
