O’Neill et al. later extended
their investigation to the cloaking of coated inclusions in thin plates for frequency ranges in which
scattering resonances occur [15] and to the cloaking of finite clusters of pins in thin plates [16]. Here, we present the idea of using active evanescent multipole devices to cloak and ‘shield’
an inclusion in a thin plate. In particular, we make use of the fact that the solution to the time-
harmonic biharmonic equation consists of not only Hankel functions of the first kind, HY, but
also Macdonald functions K, (see [17]). By shielding, we convey a finite region of ‘stillness’ in
the vicinity of the inclusion. The reason we use the quotation marks is to emphasize, here and in
what follows, the approximate nature of the stillness (or silence for acoustics) of these regions.
