Ring1B, the principal catalytic subunit of PRC1, was found
not to affect Xist mediated silencing [37].

While the aforementioned experiments indicate that Poly-
comb has at most a marginal effect on Xist mediated silencing
in embryonic cells, there are some caveats that need to be con-
sidered. The assay to determine the silencing function of
different Xist regions is relatively crude, relying on the occur-
rence (or not) of significant levels of cell death following
induction of Xist expression from the single X chromosome
in XY mESCs [18]. The absence of obvious silencing defects
in the PRC2 (Eed) deficient mESC model needs to be inter-
preted in light of the fact that PRC1 and H2AK119u1,
which may contribute to silencing, are retained [23,25].
Additionally, in the PRC1 (Ring1B) deficient model, PRC2
mediated H3K27me3, and to some degree H2AK119u1, are
still present [37], the latter presumably reflecting the activity
of the Ring1B functional homologue, Ring1A. The relevance
of this latter consideration is underscored by our recent find-
ings demonstrating that in the complete absence of PRC1
activity (RinglA+ Ring1B null), PRC2 recruitment by Xist
RNA is entirely abolished [29]. Importantly, none of the
prior studies have assessed whether Xist mediated silencing
is affected by complete abrogation of both PRC1 and PRC2
recruitment. Are these caveats relevant? The answer it
