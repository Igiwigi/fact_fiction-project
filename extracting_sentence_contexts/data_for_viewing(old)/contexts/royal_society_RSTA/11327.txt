to heat the porcelain reservoir to the temperature of ebullition of sulphur, to see if
under the actual circumstances prolonged exposure to a high temperature would
produce a modification of the initial pressure. As is well known, certain bodies
retain traces of water or condensed gases up to very high temperatures, and, as the
reservoir had been washed with distilled water, there was some ground for appre-

hension that, in spite of the care taken with the filling, it might possibly have
retained traces of water.

After a heating of 26 hours above 400° we found in fact an initial pressure
considerably greater than that given above, viz. :—
