When the bills of mortality, digeſted. into a proper .
form, ſhall haye been kepta/ convenient, time in every
city or conſiderable-towny and alſo in eyery/hundred,
or-other proper divifion, of; the:country (and: this: I
ſhould be; glad to {ce done) then, and not-till then,
the: hypotheſis may be |tried-by-the: facts; that will,
appear fromthe bills, and be confirmed: or rejected
accordingly,

Indeed (for my own part) I am almoſt perſuaded,
from what has been-above' remarked, that-the hy-
potheſis will, in general, appear to be the nearer the,
truth, the more thoſe bills of mortality ſhall be- in
number, and the correcter/ they are kept, I ſhall
proceed, therefore, to; mention thoſe alterations,
which, I. think, may be of advantage, in the form
of the bills of mortality, in-every part of theſe: king. doms, over and: above: thoſe: mentioned: by Mr,
Morris, in the before-quoted pamphlet.
