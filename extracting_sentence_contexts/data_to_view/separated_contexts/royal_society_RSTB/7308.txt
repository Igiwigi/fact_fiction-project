In the Lucilia curve, which continues longer than that for C. chloropyga, since the latter
species suffers elimination when the initial mixed population exceeds 5000, the rapid
decline in puparial length observed in the lower density range as the population increases
is succeeded by a more gradual decrease as the mean minimum puparial size for the species

is approached. The similarity to the intraspecific curves in both species is as striking as was
the resemblance in the case of mortality data. In fact, so close is the agreement that, if the
data for puparial mean sizes in the intraspecific series are plotted on the same figure with
the interspecific values, the observed values for Lucilia and C. chloropyga in the former will
fall extremely close to the respective curves for the two species in mixed populations. The reduction in size of the individuals in the mixed populations as related to increasing
initial larval density clearly follows the same law, whether the species are feeding alone or in
company. The effects obtained in the mixed population are derived from the sum of the
effects of competition in the two separate populations of which it is composed.
