In fact, Professor Darwin has shown that the stresses
which would be produced by the weights of our continents in an earth initially
homogeneous (7.¢., by an irregularity of less than a thousandth part of the radius)
would be so great that the material would be near the breaking point.*

We must therefore suppose that as the earth cools and the elastic constants change
there will be a series of ruptures resulting from the stresses set up in the interior. The configuration will become approximately spherical (spheroidal if rotation is taken
into account) as soon as the point of bifurcation is passed. The fact that the ultimate configuration is reached only as the result of a long
succession of ruptures puts the whole question outside the range of exact mathe-
matical treatment. We can, however, see that the final configuration (disregarding
rotation) will probably not be quite spherical, but will retain traces of the initial
unsymmetrical configuration.

§ 35. Before we can attempt to decide whether or not the earth shows traces of a
process such as that just described, it will be necessary to form some idea of the
unsymmetrical configuration with which the process must have begun.
