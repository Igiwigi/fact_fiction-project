NJ Tux Committee appointed by the Royal Society to direct the publication of the

S appears, as well from the Council-books and Journals of the Society, as from repeated
= declarations which have been made in several former Transactions, that the printing of
© them was always, from time to time, the single act of the respective Secretaries till the

S had happened for any length of time to be intermitted. And this seems principally to

thanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors of
such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through whose
hands they received them, are to be considered in no other light than as a matter of
civility, in return for the respect shown to the Society by those communications. 'The
like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions, and curiosities of
various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society; the authors whereof, or those
who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report and even to certify in the public
newspapers, that they have met with the highest applause and approbation.
