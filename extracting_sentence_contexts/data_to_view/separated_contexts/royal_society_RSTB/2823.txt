But
these all take their place between the homosporous Lycopods and the Ophioglossacew,
in our present view, on grounds of comparison of the sporophyte. The details of the
gametophyte of the Psilotacese and Sphenophyllez are unfortunately not available for
comparison,” so that we are thrown back for comparison of the sexual generation upon
Tsoetes only, a genus which, on grounds of its heterospory, some may be disposed to
discount.f It is a remarkable fact that two of the Filicineous characters above
noted by Lana for the Ophioglossacee, are shared by Isoctes, viz., the multiciliate
spermatozoids and the absence of a suspensor. These facts, taken together with the
characters of the sporophyte, which show clearly Lycopodinous qualities, with a
learning towards megaphylly, and a corresponding extension of the sporangium,
indicate in its case a singular parallelism of these apparently independent characters,
and a tendency in them all towards those characteristic of Ferns. So much is this so,
that various writers have, notwithstanding the palpable Lycopodinous type of its
sporophyte, ranked Jsoetes with the Ferns.t

From Isoetes then we learn that a combination of cross-characters is found in @
megaphyllous Lycopod type. What we find in the Ophioglossacee is that in conjune-
tion with their more pronounced megaphyllous form, still retaining, however, the
Lycopodinous plan of the sporophyte, they show more pronounced “ Filicinean”
characters of the gametophyte and of the sexual organs.
