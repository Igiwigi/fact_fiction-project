restricted species need more coverage than widespread ones to
avoid extinction [51]. Accordingly, species-specific conservation
targets, or the proportion of species geographical ranges that
had to fall within the PA system in order to ensure their persist-
ence, were set to be inversely proportional to log-transformed
European species’ range sizes. Hence, species with restricted
ranges required 100% of their range to be covered, whereas wide-
spread species only required 10% [52]. We fitted a linear
regression between these two extremes to define the target for
the remaining species (see the electronic supplementary material,
figure S2). We conducted the species-specific target estimations
for the four groups separately. This had the advantage of
enabling us to take into consideration the fact that the minimum
range size for a reptile is different than for a bird species, for
instance. This approach assumed that the species with the largest
range is in an optimal situation and requires a minimal level of
protection (approx. 10%).

We then extracted the proportion of range currently covered
for each species, in order to estimate how far species’ met their
defined targets (species target achievement), i.e. by dividing
this proportion by the defined target.
