derived as follows. During the period 1 January to 31 July, 1932, observations on
the distribution of European sources of atmospherics were made at Slough on a
frequency of 10 kc./sec. for half an hour near 13.00 G.M.T. each week-day. On the
days on which noon penetration frequencies for Region E were available the peak
amplitudes of all atmospherics recorded in this operation as coming from sources
within 3000 km. were summed to form the ‘ thunderstorm index figure ’’. The
relation between the penetration frequency and the “‘ thunderstorm index figure ”
was found to be represented by a correlation coefficient as high as +0-75. It has,
however, since been found that the occurrence of abnormal Region E reflexion is
usually accompanied with improved short-wave communication, so that the
question arises whether the value of the ‘‘ thunderstorm index figure ”’ as defined
above would be influenced at all by transmission conditions and whether the high
correlation observed is merely the expression of the fact that the intensity of atmo-
spherics is increased, by way of improved transmission, when abnormal Region E
reflexion is present. Our knowledge of long-wave transmissions under these
abnormal conditions is so slight, however, that we are unable to give a definite
answer on this point.

A further contribution to this subject was made by Ratcurre and WuirteE in
1934 who, from a rigorous statistical examination of (P’, ¢) data, confirmed earlier
work concerning the connexion between abnormal Region E reflexion and magnetic
activity. A similar examination led them to conclude that there was also a definite
connexion between such reflexion and British thunderstorms. In connexion with
this conclusion and the result of Ranzi’s mentioned above, it may not be superfluous
to recall the well-known connexion between thunderstorms and atmospheric
