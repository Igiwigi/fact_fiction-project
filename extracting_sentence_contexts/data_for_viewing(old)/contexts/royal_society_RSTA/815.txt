For small undercoolings Tj ~ TL, and AGis ~ AH¢ AT/T;, with AH; the heat of fusion and AT the

undercooling of the melt, equation (3.3) is simplified to

In the case of pure metals, growth is collision-limited, i.e. Vo = Vs, with Vs the speed of sound,
of the order of Vs *1000ms~! [13]. In fact, this assumption is validated by measurement of the
dendrite growth velocity as a function of undercooling of pure nickel [14]. By contrast, in the
case of semiconductors, growth is diffusion-limited, ie. Vp =Vp, with Vp the atomic diffusive
speed [15]. The atomic diffusive speed is of the order of Vp ~10ms7! [16]. This finding is [5
supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations both for silicon and for Si-Ge alloys [17,18]. a)

Jackson [19] added an entropic term to equation (3.2) also assuming diffusion-controlled :
