ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC INDUCTIONS IN THE SURROUNDING FIELD. 289

A eireuit containing & voltaic cal. Q We may pass on from the discharge of a condenser to the consideration of the

Qcurrent in a circuit containing a voltaic cell. The chemical theory of the cell will be
hero adoptedâ€”in fact, the hypothesis I am endeavouring to set forth has no meaning
Son the voltaic metal-contact theory.
= Leb us suppose the cell to consist of zinc and copper plates, a vessel of dilute
=pulphuric acid, and copper wires attached to each plate which on junetion complete the
Seircuit. For simplicity I shall disregard the effect of the air and suppose that it is a
-Zneutral gas causing no induction.
:Z We 8ball begin by supposing the circuit open. Then we know that on immersion
here will be temporary currents in the wires, the quantities of these currents depend-
Sing on the electrostatic capacity of the system composed of the wires.
