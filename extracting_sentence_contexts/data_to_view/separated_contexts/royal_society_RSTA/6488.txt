Introducing the perpendicular electrostatic field E | (z) = —Vy(z) and the approximate relation

D1 (2) ~e0e1@E.@), (2.2)

which becomes virtually exact in the long-wavelength limit for constant vertical displacement
field D, (z), we can rewrite the Poisson equation as

coV2W(2) = ~€7!@)p(2) — Di@Veq"). (23)

According to the Boltzmann equation, the charge density is determined by the electrostatic
potential via

where j14(z) and _(z) are the non-electrostatic contributions to the chemical potential of positive
and negative ions, respectively. In the following, we set 24(z) = 4—(z) =0. Note that the vertical
displacement is determined by the charge density via

Di@Zj= I dz'p(z’). (2.5)

In fact, the system of equations (2.3)—(2.5) constitutes a nonlinear integro-differential equation. In
[3-7], we have solved this differential equation numerically, and in the present communication we
obtain approximate analytic solutions. For this we choose a simplified box profile for the dielectric
profile in the form of

@= |? for z <z* (2.6)

e, forz>z*.
