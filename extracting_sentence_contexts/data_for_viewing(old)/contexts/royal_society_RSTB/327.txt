And we also found that, except such slight paresis as might well have been accounted
for by the unavoidable injury to the adjacent marginal convolution, even very exten-
sive removal of the gyrus fornicatus was productive of no muscular paralysis. On the
other hand, we obtained well marked deficiency in the general and tactile sensibility
of the opposite side of the body, and concluded therefrom that this part of the limbic
lobe was probably concerned with the reception of sensory impressions.

If the view which is usually held, viz., that in the central nervous system the
direction of conduction and degeneration is the same, be correct, this conclusion of
ours would have to he modified, in consideration of the extensive descending
degencrations along the whole area of the pyramidal tract which are recorded by
Mr. France as resulting from the lesions of the gyrus fornicatus, for it would be
difficult, with these facts before us, to arrive at any conclusion other than that
centrifugal nervous impulses emanate from the cells of this gyrus, and pass down
along the course of the motor tract.

The question which would then arise is, What is the nature of these centrifugal
impulses Â¢ The observations already referred to would seem to show that they do
not pass to the skeletal muscles, and the idea suggests itself that they are of vaso-
motor (? inhibitory) character. Such a supposition is not at variance with the hemi-
anesthetic results obtained on removal of the gyrus fornicatus, for these results
might be explained by supposing contraction of cutaneous vessels (and consequent
numbness) to result from the removal.

But are we bound to accept the above view regarding conduction and degeneration
