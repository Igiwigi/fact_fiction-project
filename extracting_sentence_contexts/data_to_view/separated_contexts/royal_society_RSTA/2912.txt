Another local drop in tail size occurs close to v = 0.3, but the
phenomenon is less clear. Indeed, in this region where breather velocity v is relatively small, tail
size tends to be small for all values of v. This is consistent with the fact that static breathers (case
v =0) are strictly localized [46].

5. Discussion

We have derived several amplitude equations to approximate slowly modulated periodic waves
in the DpS equation with nonlinearity exponent close to unity. These models provide analytical
approximations of travelling breather solutions with superexponential spatial decay (either
Gaussian or with compact support).
