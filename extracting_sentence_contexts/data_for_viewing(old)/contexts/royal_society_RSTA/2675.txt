samples, but hardly contains any information about the details of the geometry.

The outer shape of the pipe can be clearly recognized although the resolution is better in the
region close to z=0 where the acceptance of the detectors is optimal. The inner wall cannot be
inferred so easily although a clear trend to accumulate scattering centres in the inner, hollowed
part of the pipe is observed for increasing pipe thickness. Most of the scattering centres in this
region are produced by muons that cross the pipe two times, invalidating the POCA assumption
on the number of interactions, and making the reconstruction of the inner radius a difficult task.

A further assumption on the azimuthal symmetry of the wear suffered by the pipe is
considered, allowing the projection of the two-dimensional histograms into one single coordinate:
the radius of the POCA scattering centre. The resulting distributions can be seen in figure 3. This
projection confirms the fact that the outer pipe face is easy to identify, while the inner face is more
difficult, providing a soft gradient towards zero instead of a steep fall at the radial position of the
wall.
