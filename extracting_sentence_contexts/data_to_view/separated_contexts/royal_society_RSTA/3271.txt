Note that such a plot corresponds in figure 16b to orthogonal cuts taken along the
Rz and R directions. As clearly seen from figure 18, the four-body term is as repulsive as
300.0 kJmol"! (at ve-CASDC/CBS level) for such geometries. In fact, such a trend is further
exacerbated as long as other regions of the nuclear configuration space are accessed. Yet, the
simple addition of the VER) term makes the triplet linear structure, LCaC de ), to be a true
minimum on the full PES with characteristic bond lengths Rj = R3 = 2.524a9 and Ry = 2.435a9;
such a feature can best be seen from figure 17. Moreover, the four-body term ensures that the
DMBE form reproduces the correct endothermicities for dissociation into Co(a>/Tu) + Co(a> Tu)
