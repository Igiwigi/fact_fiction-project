including conventional types of loads and rising number of new PE-interfaced loads
and efficient lighting.

— Load forecasting uncertainty.

(iv) System controls-based uncertainties

— Parameters of generator controllers (excitation and voltage controllers, governors,
damping controllers, PE interface controllers).


— Parameters of network controllers (secondary voltage controllers, controllers of 4 |
FACTS devices and HVDC controllers).

(v) Operating condition-related uncertainties aa!

— Contractual power flows as a consequence of different market mechanisms and is
Price. LS
— System faults (type, location, duration, frequency, distribution, impedance of system 12
faults and disturbances).

(vi) ICT-related uncertainties

— Noise, measurement errors, time delays, loss of signals, bandwidth, missing data.
