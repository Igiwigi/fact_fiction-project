(cf. figure 2) are not form-invariant under coordinate transformations, at least not for the elasticity

tensors of ordinary materials [40-42]. Here, c =C(r) is the elasticity tensor and p = p(r) the
local mass density. Intuitively, this finding is related to the fact that general mechanical waves
in three dimensions can have three different polarizations, namely two transverse and one
longitudinal polarization. By contrast, one usually only has two transverse polarizations of
electromagnetic waves (and even scalar quantities in thermodynamics). The elastic equations
are not even form-invariant in the static case [40]. Intuitively, this is related to the fact that
one can describe a homogeneous isotropic conductor by a simple scalar conductivity (figure 2).
Likewise, a single scalar material parameter is sufficient for electrostatics, magnetostatics, static

diffusion, or static heat conduction as well. By contrast, one needs a rank-4 elasticity tensor, CG to
describe a homogeneous isotropic elastic solid. In the isotropic case, this tensor contains only two
independent scalar quantities, namely the bulk modulus B (the inverse of the compressibility)
and the shear modulus G. The Young’s modulus as well as the Poisson’s ratio v result from B
and G.

Without form-invariance under coordinate transformations, we cannot proceed as in
electromagnetism or in thermodynamics. End of the story? For the special case of acoustics in
gases or fluids, the situation is simpler because their shear modulus is strictly zero, ie. G=0.
