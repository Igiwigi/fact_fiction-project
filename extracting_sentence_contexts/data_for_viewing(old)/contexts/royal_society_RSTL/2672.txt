column B, where the force is again nearly as — in the case of the distances being

small, as at 9* and 45, We also perceive in one instance, that where the distances
are as 4: 1, the forces are as 6:1, as in the distances 18? and 4*5 of column B.

20. These facts are of great consequence to every species of electrical inquiry de-
pending on any instrument whose indications are derived from repulsion. CoULOMBE
found, for example, that the balls of his balance were repelled with only one half the
force at a given distance when the quantity of electricity in one of them was reduced

to one half, and further concludes that the whole repulsive force expressed by Þ

diminishes for the same distance, D, as the absolute quantity of electricity in each of
the repelling bodies considered as points. This principle he applied extensively, with
a view of detecting the ratios of the quantities of electricity accumulated in charged
bodies or in any given point of them. The electricity of the given point he considered
as transferable to a small insulated disc, first applied to the body, and subsequently
placed in his balance, the ball of the needle being already charged with a certain
