The episternals unquestionably have independent
cartilages, and 80 I believe have the xiphisternals, though I have failed to get 80
clear a demonstration of the latter,

'The primitive cartilages of the true sternum (entosternal) and the thoracic-abdo-
minal hamapophyses (hyosternals and hyposternals) are distinct from, and deeper-
seated than, the thin stratum of cartilage-cells which pervades and thickens the yen-
tral fibrous integument, I am unwilling to suppose that RaTarE could have eyer wit-

nessed the marked distinction between the ossification of these endo-skeletal parts and
the superadded dermal ossified layer, and have made no mention of it. He, in fact,
maintains his opinion, © that the plastron is nothing else but a part of the dermo-
skeleton, and that it has nothing in common, in an anatomical point of view, with
the sternum of other animals*,” thus diverging to an opposite extreme from that of
the Geoffroyan hypothesis, although rather by arguments drawn from the relative
position of other parts of the skeleton and from Comparative Anatomy than from the
actual phenomena of the deyelopment of the plastron.

* Tf the plastron of the Chelonia were the homologue of the sternum in other
Vertebrates,” says RaTHkE, © one must also admit that the bones composing the
shoulder and pelvis are situated in a manner entirely contrary to the general dispo-
sition of those parts in other animals.” But that remark would equally apply as an
argument against the carapace being homologous with the vertebra and ribs, as
Raraxs contends it to be. It appears to me, however, that the peculiarly advanced
position of the scapular arch in the embryo Chelonia, and, at its first appearance in
all other Vertebrates, in relation to the thoracic hamal arches,—a transitory relative
position 80 beautifully explained by the recognition of the scapular arch'as the hazmal
arch of the occipital vertebra—equally explains and removes the anomaly of its posi-
tion in regard to the plastron of the adult Chelonians as in regard to the carapace. In both instances the Chelonian peculiarity or anomaly, in the relative position of
the bones of the shoulder, is due to the retrogradation. of the scapular arch and the
concomitant expansion of certain succeeding hemal arches ; as, for example, that
formed by the second pair of dorsal ribs above, and by the episternal and hyosternal
bones below; the one extending above the arch as a roof, the other beneath it as a
floor.
