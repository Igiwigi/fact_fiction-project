outer opening of the external auditory meatus. Whether, as Scorr reports, but does
not show in his figure, there is really an exposed surface of periotic bone in the occipital
hollow above this bar, cannot be determined from the Munich skull, where the periotics
have fallen out ; there is certainly a small gap here which they may possibly have filled,
but in any case this would not be the right position for a pars mastoidea. ‘The squamosal
clearly carries the whole of the lateral occipital crest and is flattened down on to the
occipital surface of the skull above and lateral to this gap.

It is interesting that the lateral occipital crests pass below into the dorsal edges of
the zygomata around the borders of enormous flaps or hoods of bone, that rise up from
the back of the glenoids and overhang the lateral openings of the external auditory
meati—interesting, because of the resemblance of these hoods to the characteristic,
though much less magnificent hoods in the Suidee, and in view of the fact that in more
primitive Suide, such as Paleocherus and Percherus, they are larger than in the recent
forms.

The glenoid itself and the postglenoid process are in no way Anthracothere-like ;
the latter is broad from side to side and very low, the former curving gently down on to
its face, so that the resulting surface is the section of a cylinder, rather like that in Dicotyles
and probably permitting no greater freedom of movement to the mandibular condyle.

Scorr did not, in the paper just referred to, compare Entelodon with the Anthracotheres.
He compared it with Hippopotamus however, pointing out resemblances both superficial
and deeper seated. These latter, it seems to me, are equally shared with the Anthra-
cotheres. ‘The Suide appear to be rather more remote. But there are certain characters
