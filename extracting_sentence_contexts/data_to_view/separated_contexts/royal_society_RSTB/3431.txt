The terminal bud is of simple structure, with only one or two whorls of
sheathing leaves. This species differs in form from all the others, and there seems
to be little doubt that it is identical with the petrified type. The chief difficulty to
this hypothesis is the fact that, hitherto, impressions of C. chareformis have not been
found lower than the Middle Coal Measures,t whereas it appears to be the
commonest form in the calcareous nodules of the Lower Measures. Possibly it has
escaped observation in the shales of the latter horizon, owing to its small size;
while its delicate structure would probably increase the rarity of well-preserved
specimens,
