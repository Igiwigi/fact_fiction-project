tube. The glands seem composed of nucleated cells, imbedded in a granular stroma ;
and in the concavity of the kidney-shaped organ may be seen a definitely-shaped
granular mass leading to the duct, conveying the secretion to the stomach, which it
enters just above, or by the side of the insertion of the cesophagus. These glands are
evidently salivary or pancreatic, and at least are subservient to the process of digestion.

The stomach (Plate XXXIIL. fig. 1 I) itself is a comparatively large and sacculated
cavity, of an ovoid shape, the sacculi giving it s0mewhat the aspect of a bunch of grapes
where the berries are closely compacted together. Each little pouch or sacculus has
in its-centre a large clear nucleus; and on comparing it with the stomach of Votom-
mata claviculata (Enrex.), in which hepatic ezca are appended to each sacculus,
there is reason to think these nucleated cells also subserve the function of a liver.
This belief is further countenanced by the fact of the stomach, when employed in the
digestion of the food, assuming a yellowish brown colour, and at least the whole pro-
cess of assimilation is performed in this cavity alone. There is no other orifice to
the stomach except the cardiac or c80phageal one; hence there is no intestine, and
the siliceous $hells of its prey, and other rejectamenta, are brought back to the pha-
rynx /and rejected by the oral 'orifice. In this process also we see- the forcipated
jaws frequently assisting to eject/the larger portions of the digested food. I have
frequently een this act performed, and- the empty shells of Brachioni and Closteria
returned and forced out again by the action of the jaws. There are apparently long
ribbon-$haped museles (Plate XXXIIL. fig.6) that pass from the pharynx along the c280-
