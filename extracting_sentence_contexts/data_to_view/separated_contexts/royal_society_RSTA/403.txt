Even battery-less systems by passive RFID technologies
are possible for this type of communication [8]. But, unfortunately, the radio links are often too
weak for reliable direct communication, owing to the high water content of food products. In fact,
an important first step, to test radio link quality before system application, is often left out, and
system planning directly jumps into either a cost-efficient RFID system or an elaborate system
providing multi-hop communication. A well-founded decision should be based on an analysis of
radio signal attenuation in the target set-up [7], depending on radio frequency, product, packing,
water content and sensor placement.

(b) Surface or core measurement? Because shelf life is related to product core temperature, sensors should ideally be placed in the
centre of boxes or packing units.
