E of control over the muscles generally, always associated with true idiocy, were noticeable
in the case of both idiots; and this might appear to be in part explicable, on the ordinary
hypothesis that the cerebellum is concerned in coordinating the voluntary muscular movye-
ments, by the obvious deficiency in the bulk of that organ in both these cases; but, on
the other hand, the fact that the cerebellum is larger in the idiot boy, though his powers
of locomotion were altogether absent, and though he could not handle anything, nor
articulate any words, seems contradictory and inexplicable. Under these circumstances
it is at least interesting to find that one of the cerebellar commissural systems of fibres
is 80 much more deficient in him than in the idiot woman; and whether we adopt the
view that the office of the cerebellum is directly to coordinate the muscular moyements,
or that it indirectly aids in this coordination, by registering the various muscular sensa-

tions indicative of the manifold conditions of the muscles, such a deficiency of these com-
missural fibres may be equally supposed to interfere with the functions of the organ,
