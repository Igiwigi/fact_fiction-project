Shrinking people down to the micrometre is a classical science-fiction premise in which the agents
could manipulate tiny objects as in a microscopic factory. Ultimately, they may be injected in the : a
body and repair dysfunctional organs or carry drugs to the appropriate cells. Beyond the limitless 1
imagination of writers, this points towards a challenging question for the scientific community: [fg
how can we design populations of artificial microagents capable of moving autonomously in a oe
controlled fashion while performing complex tasks?
