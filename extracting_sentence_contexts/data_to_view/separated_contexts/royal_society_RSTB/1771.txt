Thus the total of legitimate and illegitimate natality offers only the statistical
expression of the state of things, but not the measure of the force of procreative power. 5. Especially with the legitimate fecundity, we have to provide for the fact that
the number of children depends not only on the number of husbands or wives at the
procreative age, but also on the condition that both partners of the couple be still
prolific. The birth-rates mentioned before are all monogenous ones; it needs no
proof that the bigenous birth-rates furnish a more reliable measure of legitimate
fecundity. To obtain this measure we have to put into the denominator the
couples (C) at productive age.
