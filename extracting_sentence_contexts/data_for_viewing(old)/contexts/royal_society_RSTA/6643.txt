on the geometry of the device. However, once the device is built, the mixing is set.
Thus, a control parameter in a duct-like flow must be a parameter other than Q. The
herringbone mixer of Stroock et al. (2002) has no independent control parameter.
The mixers by Tabeling et al. (2004) and Bottausci et al. (2004) have two control
parameters: an amplitude and a frequency of pressure gradients producing cross-flows
(the system of Bottausci et al. in fact has three pairs). Examples of other control
parameters include speed of moving parts (impellers and so on), frequency of time-
dependent electric fields. All these devices allow for optimization without changing
the device itself.

Wiggins & Ottino (2004) review elements of the necessary theory and definition of
terminology in a mathematically rigorous way. They present a basic representation
of mixing applicable to two-dimensional blinking flows, and with proper caveats, to
duct flows. This does not mean that all necessary theory has already been developed,
and it is clear that further mathematical developments are needed; in fact we outline
a few steps that should be taken to complete the description. It is fair to say, however,
that the field would benefit by closer convergence of applications and theory.
