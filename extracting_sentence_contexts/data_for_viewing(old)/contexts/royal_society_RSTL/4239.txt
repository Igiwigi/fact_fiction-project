156 MR. BRODIE ON CEROTIC ACID.

The products of this distillation prove also that we must look to some other body
than the cerin for the source of the margaric acid, or the acid resembling that sub-
stance which has been found in the wax distillate, and for the origin also of the
parafſin, of which only traces can be found even on the distillation of the impure
cerin.

The existence of a free acid in wax is a fact to which we have no parallel in the
constitution of any known fat, and although the reactions, which I have given, left
little doubt upon my mind that in the wax the acid was in this condition, it yet ap-
peared to me desirable to procure it from the wax by simple crystallization. By
patience this may be accomplished. The cerin analysed by M. Lewy melted at
62*5 C. T have stated that by means of alcohol this substance may be procured of
a melting-point of 72%. If this substance of 72* melting-point be repeatedly dissolved
and crystallized out of a large quantity, not of alcohol, but of ether, the melting-point
can be raised to 78, in which state the substance is highly crystalline, and has all
the appearance of the acid as procured by other means.
