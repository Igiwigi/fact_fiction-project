In fact, two distinct processes are going on—the one,
Smotor, represented by the impulses from the motor ganglia, and corresponding to the
Z blow by which snch an explosive substance as nitro-glycerine, for instance, is exploded ;
= the other, trophic, represented by the action of the vagus upon the muscular sub-
B 8tance, and corresponding to something affecting the nature or properties of the
Sexploaive substance itself.
'> The problem, then, to be explained is, what conception can be formed of the nature
= of the changes caused in the muscle by the action of the nerve, which shall satisfy the
2 conditions that the same nerve can produce in different cases a graduated series of
= different effects extending from a simple increase in the force of the contractions on
E S'the one side down to diminution of force even to complete standstill on the other ? In trying to form a theory to explain new facts, it is always advisable to see if any
& theory which has been devised to explain somewhat similar facts will apply to this case
D also. , With this consideration 1 cannot help thinking that the recent views which
Z have been put forward to explain the changes going on in gland cells in a condition of
rest and activity may help in the conception of the changes going on in the cardiac
8 muscle cells under the influence of such a nerve as the vagus. In all secretory glands it
appears to be the fact that the formation of the ultimate products of secretion is a
gradual process, three stages of which can be recognised, viz. :
