feeble branch from the second dorsal root is said to be united. In the diagram of the
plexus, a cord connecting the sixth and seventh cervical nerve roots is figured.

Cuauveau and ArLomnc* do not give a separate account of the brachial plexus of
the Dog, but describe that of the Carnivora, and mention any special points in which
the Dog's plexus departs from the general type. They state that the last four cervical
nerve roots and the first dorsal nerve root enter into the formation of the brachial
plexus of the Carnivora ; but that the twig from the fifth cervical root is an insignifi-
cant one. The musculo-cutaneous nerve is said to be formed from the sixth and
seventh cervical roots; the musculo-spiral in the Dog exclusively from the eighth
root, afterwards receiving branches from the median, ulnar, and circumflex nerves.
These authors do not state from which roots the median and ulnar nerves are derived,
but mention the fact that the ulnar joins the median in the upper arm, and that
the median receives a branch from the musculo-cutaneous just above the elbow joint.

Foreurt describes and figures the brachial plexus of the Dog, as formed by the
three last cervical and the first two dorsal nerve roots. In his description he applies
the term “ médian externe” to what we would call the musculo-cutaneous, which is
said to be derived from the sixth and seventh cervical roots. What he calls the
“ médian interne” we know as the median, and is formed from the eighth cervical
and the first dorsal roots, according to him, _ His radial corresponds to our musculo-
spiral, which he states has its origin from the seventh and eighth cervical and the first
dorsal nerve roots, while the ulnar is derived from the first dorsal root.

A comparison of these descriptions shows us that certain discrepancies exist in the
