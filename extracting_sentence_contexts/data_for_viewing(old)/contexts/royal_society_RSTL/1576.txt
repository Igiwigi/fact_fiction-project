two ounces of strong infusion of rhubarb were injected into
the stomach, and in an hour the dog was killed. The urine
in the bladder, on the addition of potash, became deeply tinged
with rhubarb. The bile in the gall bladder, by a similar test,
was found to contain rhubarb. The lacteal vessels in several
parts of the mesentery had burst, and chyle was extravasated
mo the cellular membrane ; the thoracic duct had given way
in the lower part of the posterior mediastinum, and chyle was
extravasated, Above the ruptured part the thoracic duct was
much distended with chyle ; it was readily traced to the liga-
ture, by which it was completely secured.

These experiments appeared to establish the fact, that the
thoracic duct was not the channel through which the infusion
of rhubarb was conveyed to the circulation of the blood, and
it now became easy to ascertain, whether it passed through the
spleen, by extirpating that organ, and repeating the last expe-
riment.
