system in contact with a quantum mechanical bath, and find a close connection with the
directly observable nonlinear optical response. The result indicates that memory in the
bath-induced fluctuations rather than in the dissipation causes non-Markovianity. Initial
correlations between states of the system and the bath are shown to be essential for a
correct understanding of the non-Markovianity. These correlations are included in our
treatment through a preparation function.

1. Introduction

For macroscopic systems, the second law of thermodynamics prescribes ever-
increasing entropy. In fact, decreases of entropy are permitted on short time
scales. When the dynamics of small quantum systems on short time scales
is studied, the flow of information between the environment and the system
can be important [1]. In a microscopic theory, there are three major effects of
he environment (or bath) on the system. The first two are dissipation, which
removes excess energy from the system, and fluctuations, which supply energy.
These two effects are related through the fluctuationâ€”dissipation theorem, which
ensures that the correct finite temperature equilibrium state is reached. The
hird one is the entanglement between system and environment states, which
is well known in the fields of nonlinear optics and nuclear magnetic resonance
NMR) and is a key property in open system dynamics and quantum information.
The entanglement is almost always present if the bath is described quantum
mechanically. It is the characteristic quantity which causes the system state to
