In the great majority of cases, however, the activity
of these motions is conspicuously diminished. The effect of excising all the marginal tisxue from between the eye-specks and
leaving the latter untouched is not s0 definite as is the effect of the converse experi-
ment just described. Moreoyer allowance must here be made for the fact that in this
experiment the principal portion of the © veil” is of necessity removed; s0 that it
becomes impossible to decide how much of the enfeebling effect of the section is due
to the removal of locomotor centres from the nectocalyx, and how much to a change
in the merely mechanical conditions of the organ. From the fact, however, that
excision of the entire margin of Sarsia produces total paralysis, while excision of the
eye-specks alone produces merely partial paralysis, there can be no doubt that both
causes are combined. Indeed it has been a matter of the greatest surprise to me
how very minute a portion of the intertentacular marginal tissue is sufficient, in the
case of this genus, to animate the entire nectocalyx.
