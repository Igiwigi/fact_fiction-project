A crystal of ferrideyanide of potassium, s1s-
pended between the two poles in such a manner
that its axis « becomes vertical and therefore its
base A horizontal, sets with energy x axially
(fig. 1). This axis z remains similarly directed
even when we reduce the original prism to a plate,
by taking away its obtuse edges. Such a plate
appears to be repelled by the two poles like a dia-
magnetic body, while a plate cut out of the same
prism by grinding down its acute edges will be
directed, the mode of suspension remaining the
same, like a paramagnetic body, as in fact it is. The same prism, suspended in such a manner that Fig. 2. |
its axis « may oscillate between the two poles in the
horizontal plane, points equatorially, and s8eems to be |
repelled by the poles like a diamagnetic body.
