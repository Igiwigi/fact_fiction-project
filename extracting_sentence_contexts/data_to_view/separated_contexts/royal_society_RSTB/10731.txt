In this review,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0321 I examine these relationships in non-human primates. Because most existing
theoretical models of the evolution of sex roles focus on the evolutionary ori-
gins of sex-biased behaviour, they offer only a general scaffold for predicting
variation in sex roles among and within species. I argue that studies examining
sex role variation at these more specific levels need to take social organization
One contribution of 16 to a theme issue â€˜Adult into account to identify meaningful levels for the measurement of ASR and
sex ratios and reproductive strategies: a critical to account for the fact that ASR and sex roles mutually influence each other. Moreover, taxon-specific life-history traits can constrain sex role flexibility
and impact the operational sex ratio (OSR) by specifying the minimum
length of female time outs from reproduction. Using examples from the pri-
mate literature, I highlight practical problems in estimating ASR and OSR.
