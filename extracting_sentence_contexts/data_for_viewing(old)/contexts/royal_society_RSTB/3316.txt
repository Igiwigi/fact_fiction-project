branches the lower leaves were dimerous, opposite or sub-opposite, and decussate,
but exactly at the sixth node a change took place, in the initiation of pleiomerous
whorls, without, however, affecting the internode-curve. The nature of the leaves
at the successive nodes is indicated in the appended table.

The measurements of the internodes and longitudinal displacements of the leaves
show that these seem to conform with the same rule, namely, that alternate
internodes, and associated leaf-displacements, are apparently more closely correlated
than successive ones. As the phyllotaxis of Lysimachia is cyclic, this phenomenon
may imply that morphogenous impulses are transmitted along the orthostichies,
and may or may not further imply that stimuli travel along the young or future
vascular tissue. A certain amount of confirmation of the rule concerning the close
correlation of alternate internodes in plants with phyllotaxis that is cyclic in fact
or design is met with in other genera dealt with in this paper; and this rule would
serve to explain some of the peculiar but regular zigzags in the internode-curves of
those plants.

Subjoined are the â€˜statistics dealing with the internodes of the plants observed.
Tn all cases, except Specimen IT, the axes measured were erect stems severed close
to the ground. The displacements are printed in smaller type.
