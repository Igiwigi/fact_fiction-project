"of close attention to the thermometry is shown by the fact that the difference between

the air and mercury readings, even at low temperatures, will more than account for a

sil change of decrease into increase in the specific heat of water as the temperature rises.

An indirect result of my present investigation is to add further proof (if that is

- necessary) to the accuracy of the measurements of temperature by platinum thermo-

/ Meters, and it is remarkable that so exact-and easy a method is not more generally

_ applied to that most dificult subject, thermometry.
