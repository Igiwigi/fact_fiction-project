exhibits a large spurious correlation.

Whether any given mixture increases or reduces the correlation will depend
entirely on the signs of the differences of the means of the sub-groups. But the
danger of heterogeneity for the problem of correlation will have been made manifest.
If the value of R for any mixture, whose components are known, is to be calculated,
then we have only to note that: :

* Thus the mere fact of breeding from two or three individuals selected at random can easily produce
a correlation between organs in the offspring, which has no existence in the species at large.

(8.) In commencing an investigation of this kind where the results to be expected
were quite unknown to us, but where we had reason to believe that the apparent
strength of inheritance must be very small, we considered that the first thing to be
done was to investigate the largest possible amount of material. Thus the probable
