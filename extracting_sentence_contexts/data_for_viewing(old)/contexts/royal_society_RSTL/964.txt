outline, leaving the minuter parts to be filled up by those who
have more leisure, but by no means more zeal, for studies of
this kind.

As these materials are collected not merely for the present

of graminivorous and carnivorous Animals. 14r;

care has been taken that every. anatomical fact brought
forward, should be ascertained by actual examination,

It is proposed to describe the internal structure of such sto-
machs as appear to form the principal links in, the grada-
tion between animals which ruminate, and those which, are
truly carnivorous, arranging them in a series, the beginning of
which is that nearest allied to the stomach of the ruminant,

Before the appearances of these different $tomachs are de-
