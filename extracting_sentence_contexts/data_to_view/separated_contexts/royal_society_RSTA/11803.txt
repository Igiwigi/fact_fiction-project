LARMOR ON A DYNAMICAL THEORY OF

velocity distributed over the elements of the conductor and independent for each
them. Nor is this in any way surprising, when we bear in mind that the velocity
a single electron is certainly of the type required for a generalized dynamical ve
component, and when we infer, as below (ยง. 23), that the forcive on a currer
considered as made up statistically from the moving electrons, is different from wh:
would be obtained by taking the current-element itself as a generalized velocit
component. Our conclusion is, then, that the only proper basis for the dynamic
analysis of the phenomena of currents flowing in conductors, in fact, of all cases of t
flow of true electricity, is to treat the currents as the statistical aggregates of
movements of the electrons. Two different Methods of Analysis,

7. With a view to the analytical formulation of the properties of an ether pervade
by electrons, it is necessary in the first place to take a survey of the various ways i
which these electrons are distributed.
