id But pursuing the question a little further I believe, in spite of the evident care
with which the whole of StemnHEIL’s calculations have been carried through, that the
comparison above shows that a small error has crept in in respect to ray (5). If we take the general agreement as showing that the trigonometrical calculation
does in fact bring in no terms of the aberrations beyond the 3rd order, we can readily
analyse STEINHEIL’s numbers in more than one way so as to derive the coefficients
8,G, ... from them. Take the formule (24); on the outer ring ¢ = 0, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, correspond
respectively to the rays 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; thus we have

d?B3,G = dc',— dc! = }(3b',+ db’,)—8’,
