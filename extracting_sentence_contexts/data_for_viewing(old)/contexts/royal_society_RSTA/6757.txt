A torque could be applied to the beam near the encastered end through a light loading
lever, clamped to the beam 6 in. from the encastered end, the lever arm for the torsion loads
being 13in. The twist of the beam was measured in the usual way by the two mirrors, 1 and
2, fixed to short lengths of copper wire soldered to the beam at points } and 5}in. from the

encastered end of the beam.

224 B. G. NEAL ON LATERAL INSTABILITY OF

A small correction to the applied torque was due to the fact that the free end of the beam
deflected slightly in a lateral direction when the torque was applied. This lateral deflexion
3, was measured by dial gauge 2, as shown, the correction to the applied torque being W,6,.

Five torsion tests were carried out on each beam, designated A to E in each case. In each
test the load W, was held constant while the torsion loads W, were increased in 1 Ib. increments
from 0 to 10Ib. and then removed. It was found that the vertical deflexion changed very
little during the torsion tests even when the beams had partially yielded, so that it was
possible to proceed with the flexure after the completion of each torsion test.

Using the theory of flexure of a cantilever in the yield range as given by Baker & Roderick
(1940), the readings of dial gauge 1 for each value of W, could be analyzed to find the values
of the upper and lower yield stresses giving the best degree of fit with the observations of load
