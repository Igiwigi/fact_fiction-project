The London Weekly Bills of Mortality preserved in the libraries of the Guildhall and
the British Museum contain information which gives, among other details, the
number of deaths from measles for every week from the year 1703 to the year 1838,
except for an unfortunate break of 12 months in the years 1829-30. From 1838 the
publications of the Registrar-General give the same information. The fact that the
data refer to deaths alone and not to the cases must be regarded as a subsidiary
drawback, since, on comparison, the statistics of cases and deaths where the informa-
tion for both is available (e.g. Aberdeen, 1880â€”1900) show a very close correspondence. It is not, of course, in the least contended that for the eighteenth century the data
are nearly as accurate as those available since the introduction of registration, but
for the purpose of this investigation the relative accuracy of figures for considerable
periods of time is nearly as important.
