(a)—Fuels Used in Experiments and Range of the Engine Conditions Investigated

Three characteristic engine fuels have been investigated, namely Shell No. 1
petrol, winter grade ; a mixture of Shell No. 1 and 8-0 cc of ethyl fluid per gallon
(i.e. 4:4 cc lead tetra-ethyl per gallon) ; and Pratt’s pure commercial benzole. For
each of these fuels the gas samples were analysed with the engine running under four

different conditions.
Experiments have also been conducted on other fuels in order to elucidate certain

facts revealed during the course of this work ; those results are recorded in Part II.
The hydrogen and carbon contents of these fuels were determined and found
to be as follows :—

Shell No. 1 Benzole

% by weight
(Chi) ie Soe, eee 85-68 . 91-30
Hydrogen. ¢ 5 14-32 : 8-70

Each of these fuels was investigated with the engine running at four different
openings of the throttle valve, the speed and ignition timing being constant. These
