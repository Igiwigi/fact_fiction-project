Yet, the function of many accessory
genes is not known [64], and the selective factors that
favour their mobility and co-occurrence are similarly unclear. Nevertheless, MGEs probably constitute the means by which
most genes travel through bacterial communities, and are
therefore potent agents of HGT [65,66]. Thus, there exist many potential routes by which genes
can transfer between bacteria, and although rates for pro-
cesses have been measured experimentally (e.g. [67-69]),
understanding the relative importance of these mechanisms
in situ is complicated by the fact that efficacies are likely to
vary between species and environments [45,70]. This can
stem from physical limitations, for example, mechanical agi-
tation can inhibit conjugative transfer [71] and different
environments are more or less harsh to extracellular DNA,

affecting opportunities for transformation [72]. It is also
likely to be driven by the ecology of both bacteria and
MGEs, for example, lysogenic conversion is more common
among bacteria with fast growth rates [73], which probably
reflects the conditions that favour the life-history strategy of
temperate phage.
