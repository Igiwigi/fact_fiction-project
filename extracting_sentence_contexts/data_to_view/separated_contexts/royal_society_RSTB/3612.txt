A reference to text-fig. 3, E, d, illustrates a common feature in the mega-
sporophylls, namely, the intimate association, and in some cases apparently organic
connection, between the loose cylinder of cells and the tissue of adjacent interseminal
scales. This fact, in conjunction with other features already alluded to, points to
an absence of a well-defined limiting layer in the pedicels of the ovules and reminds
one of the absence of a normal epidermis in the seed-peduncles of Bennettites. *

Bracts and Hairs.—The bracts of the Eathie species agree generally with those of
Bennettites Gibsonianus Carr, and B. Morierei (Sap. and Mar.), as also with the
corresponding structures in American examples of Cycadeoidea. The great
abundance of secretory sacs, the occurrence of thick-walled hypoderm, and, so far as
can be ascertained, the structure of the vascular bundles are features common to all.
