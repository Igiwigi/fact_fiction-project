The results are given in Table IV., 7 and 8, and also in Table V., where they have
been rendered comparable by altering the percentages hatched from motor-turned eggs
to what they would have been if 60 per cent. of the hand-turned eggs had hatched
in each case. Thus 42 = 34 x $8 and so on. In both hatches the motor-turned eggs
beyond the rubber have hatched much better than those that were not protected in
this way, and the conclusion seems to be justified that the rubber block did, in fact,
partly absorb some high-frequency vibration and prevent its reaching the eggs. DR. A.
