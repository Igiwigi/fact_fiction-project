AMBULACRUM IN THE ECHINOIDEA HOLECTYPOIDA. 405

the apicad ends of the ambulacra in such advanced genera as Echinus or Hetero-
centrotus are developed in a reduced state is probably due to accelerated and
compressed recapitulation, in which the stages in the attainment of the reduction
have been omitted. In this connection it is appropriate to refer to the existence of
the “biporous ambulacrals” around the Spatangid peristome. The principle
enunciated above implies that it is possible that these might originally have been
two plates, although it would be premature to attempt any conclusion on the subject
here.

There is another possible method of derivation of the Echinoid triad which, though
morphologically simple, seems less in accord with observed facts than the one
indicated above. It is at least probable that the Diademoid triad was developed by
the addition of an intervening simple plate to a Saleniid type of dyad. In such a
primitive compound, the apicad member of the pair is usually the smaller, and may
occasionally be reduced. If the intercalated plate were to become combined with the
dyad adapical to it (and to undergo the reduction which commonly befalls such
plates), an approximately Arbacioid triad would result. If, on the other hand, the
extra plate were to be attached to the dyad adoral to it, an Echinoid triad would
inevitably be produced. The very constant reduction of the apicad component of an
Echinoid triad, though less in degree than that suffered by the median plate, would
be in accord with such a theoretical origin for the compound. Text-fig. 1 shows in
