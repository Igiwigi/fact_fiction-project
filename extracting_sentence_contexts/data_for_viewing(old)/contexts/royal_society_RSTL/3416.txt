dinal lines, taking the direction of the fasciculi, these lines being here and there ex-
ceedingly strong and decided, and leaving but a very narrow light. streak between
them. In other parts they are fainter, but always parallel, unless the fibrille are bent
by violence from their course, in which case they seem to be easily disarranged, as
though their lateral connexion with one another were but slight. The striz upon
these fasciculi are very delicate, and quite regular, if the parallelism of the fibrillae be
preserved ; but where this is disturbed, the strize are, as it were, broken to pieces, and
the individual fibrille: which they erossed, bear upon them the disarranged fragments
of the markings of which they consisted. Either the strize or these markings are
everywhere clearly visible, except about the very thick longitudinal dark lines de-
8cribed, where they are always faint, sometimes undistinguishable ; a fact which
scems $ufficiently explained by the presence of those lines absorbing and obscuring
by their depth the very delicate striz that cross them at right angles; and except also
where a slight and irregular obliquity of the fibrillee causes 80 complicated an inter-
ference of the longitudinal lines among the cross markings of each, that these last,
being the faintest, are only here and there apparent*. The fibrilla:, however, are in
general readily spread abroad at the extremity of a fasciculus, and there uniformly,
when not too much injured or obliquely overlapping each other, present the markings
well defined. Indeed, some of the most beautifully marked fibrillze that T have seen
have been such as I now speak of, hanging out from the end of a fasciculus taken from
one of these fishes. In these also, as in other animals, I have frequently by accident
obtained a view of the interior of a fasciculus, and observed every fibrilla to he marked.
By maceration it is not difficult to obtain the fibrille entirely detached, and in these
