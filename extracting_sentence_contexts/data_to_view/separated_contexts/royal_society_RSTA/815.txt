Obvious exceptions are the two levels corresponding to ‘*P., and *D,,. They have
been pushed far down and up by the presence of 2F,, between them, which in turn is
due to the rapid increase of the term separations with atomic number. The selection
of 20093-0 as 65°F, and 24475-7 as 6s°G,, is based partly on the comparison with
Nimand Pd rand partly on the fact that that choice is more consistent with the observed
intensities. The relative positions of the structures nd? and nd°(n-+1)s are very different in the
three long periods. It might be expected that their difference would decrease as the
value of n increases.
