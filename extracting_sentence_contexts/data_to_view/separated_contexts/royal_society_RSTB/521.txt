As to the results, WourF called attention to the fact that with the oats and the
potatoes comparatively little increase was obtained by the use of mineral manure
without nitrogen, but that where nitrogenous manure was added the increase bore a

Leguminosee was, however, quite different. With these plants, the mineral manures
as a rule gave considerable increase, whilst the addition of the nitrate generally gave
little or no further increase.
