Here we consider a model for a global inhibitory network, where both the excitatory and
inhibitory cells are excitable. We include an explicit representation of delays in the model
equations, which allows for a systematic study of the role of delays in producing network-induced
oscillations. Motivated by the fact that many inhibitory networks in the brain have gap junctional
coupling, we assume the inhibitory cells are synchronized and represent them with a single cell. Our work can be considered an extension of the previous work [9,51,52] to include the effect of
explicit time delays. Our work is complementary to that by Bose and co-workers [34,44] as we
consider networks where both cell types are non-oscillatory.
