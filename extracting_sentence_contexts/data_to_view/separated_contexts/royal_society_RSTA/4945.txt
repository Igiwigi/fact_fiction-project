Measurements of the solar wind fluctuations also reveal turbulence power spectrum [52]. Ubiquitous non-thermal broadening of spectral lines as well as measures obtained by other
techniques [53] confirm that turbulence is present everywhere in astrophysical environments

where we test for its existence. This is not surprising as magnetized astrophysical plasmas
generally have very large Reynolds numbers due to the large length scales involved and the

fact that the motions of charged particles in the direction perpendicular to magnetic fields are
constrained. Laminar plasma flows at these high Reynolds numbers are prey to numerous linear

and finite-amplitude instabilities, from which turbulent motions readily develop.! Indeed, observations show that turbulence is ubiquitous in all astrophysical plasmas.
