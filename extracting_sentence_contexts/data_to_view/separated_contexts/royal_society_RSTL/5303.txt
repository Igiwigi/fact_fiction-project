Chalcedony.—Loud and long-continued knockings on a knob of this mineral. 8 DR. TYNDALL ON THE VIBRATIONS AND TONES PRODUCED BY

Glass.—Decided vibrations on the 8mooth rounded edge of the foot of a drinking-
glass. Mr. TreveLYan believed that he once obtained vibrations upon glass, but the
fact is doubted by Professor Forpes. This is the only experiment on non-metallic
bodies, as far as I am aware of, hitherto on record. Earthenware.—A feeble tone, which s00n ceased, was obtained on the edge of a
dinner plate.
