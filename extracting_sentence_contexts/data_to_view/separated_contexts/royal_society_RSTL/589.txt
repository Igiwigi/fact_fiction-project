ceased, towards the conclusion of the summer, at the
height of four feet. The new wood also, which was generated
by these inverted cuttings, accumulated above the bases of the
annual shoots, as in the preceding instances. These facts appear to prove, that the vessels of plants are not
equally well calculated to carry their contents in opposite di-
rections ; and, I think, afford some grounds to suspect that the
vessels of the bark, like those which constitute the venous
system of animals, (to which they are in many respects analo-
gous,) may be provided with valves, whose extreme minuteness
has concealed them from observation. The experiments, and still more, the Plates, of HaLts, have

the preceding. But the Plates of that great naturalist are not
always taken correctly from nature ;* and Plates, under such
circumstances, however fair and candid the intentions of an
author may be, will too often be found somewhat better calcu-
lated to support his own hypothesis, than to elucidate the facts
he intends to state.
