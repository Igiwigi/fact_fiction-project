This motion has been
lately mentioned in a paper, where I could not have an oppor-
tunity to enter into the reasons why it ought to be admitted.*
The discovery of the period of « Herculis furnishes me with
an opportunity to say a ſew words upon the subject, as every
addition to the list of periodical stars increases our knowledge
of the construction of the celestial bodies. Not s0 much be-
cause now one $tar more is known to be subject to periodical
changes in its lustre; for this would indeed be of no great con-
sequence. But we ought not to be satisfied with merely in-
rolling this circumstance among the list of facts we are ac-
quainted with. The rotatory motion of stars upon their axes
is a capital feature in their resemblance to the sun. It appears
to me now, that we cannot refuse to admit such a motion, and
that indeed it may be as evidently proved as the diurnal mo-
tion of the earth.
