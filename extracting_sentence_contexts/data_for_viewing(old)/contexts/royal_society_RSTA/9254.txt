field appears filled with light of the appropriate colour. Owing, however, to the fact
that the spectral light is concentrated within the limits of a narrow slit at the observer’s
eye, the appearance of the field is marred by streaks and other defects, due partly to

strie, dust particles, ete., in the optical system, and to the ‘‘ musce volitantes ” pro-
duced by non-homogeneity in the media of the eye itself. Such a system is, in fact,
of the type which one would arrange for the purpose of showing up such defects.
Further, while the spectral light is confined to this slit-aperture, the instrument primaries
are not, but completely fill the circular aperture of the observation pupil of the colori-
meter. The fact that the spectral light is, in effect, seen through a different observation
pupil from the other constituents of the colour match has the result that parallax
effects are introduced by the slightest movement of the eye. These two causes are
sufficient to destroy all precision of measurement. To obtain good matching conditions,
in which both fields can be made to look identical, with a sharp, almost invisible,
dividing line, it is necessary to ensure not only that the light is uniformly distributed
over the cross-section of the beam as it passes the field aperture, but also that it is at
least approximately uniformly distributed over the observation pupil through which
it enters the eye.

To effect this in the present investigation use was made of a spreading device which
the writer has previously described in connection with another type of instrument.*
This consists of a crown of rotating lenses, of about
