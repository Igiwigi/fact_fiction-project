The several parts of a
guadruped-are sensibly more. or less. vascular, and of different
contextures;; and, admitting that the. varied. diameter. of the
blood vessels disposed in each species of substance, were. to be
constituted by the gross sensible differences of their larger
vessels only, yet, if the ultimate vessels -were in all cases
equally numerous, 'then the. sole remaining, cause of dissimi-
larity would-be in the compacting of the, vessels.,,.. The vasa
vasorum of the larger trunks furnish no reason; excepting that
of a loose- analogy, for- the supposition. of vasa, vasorum ex-
tended without limits. Moreover, the circulating fluids, of all
animals are'composed of water, which gives them fluidity, and
of animalised particles. of defined configuration: and, bulk ; it
follows that the vessels through which such fluids are to pass,
must- be. of sufficient capacity forthe size of the particles, and
that smaller vessels could. only filtrate water devoid of such
animal partieles : a-position repugnant, to. all the. known facts
of the circulation of blood, and the. animal economy. The capillary arteries which terminate in the muscular fibre,
must be secretory.vessels for depositing the muscular matter,

watery fluids, and' the decayed substances which are unfit
for use. The lympheducts are not $0. numerous as the blood vessels,
