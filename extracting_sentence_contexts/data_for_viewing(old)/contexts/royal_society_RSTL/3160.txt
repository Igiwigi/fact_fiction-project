In this instance, however, the magnetic action was no longer effectually
intercepted, nor could it be completely shut out, except by restoring all the
interior plates as before ; that is to say, two plates above and two below were
insuflicient, and 80 on.

498 MR. HARRIS ON THE INFLUENCE OF SCREENS

3. From this cireumstance, it seemed not unreasonable to infer, as was snb-
sequently proved by the fact, that a screening power might possibly be ob-
tained in a similar way, by means of substances not containing iron, proyided
snch snbstances were employed in large masses, and were in any degree 8us-
ceptible of a transient magnetic state ; notwithstanding that from the few
experiments hitherto tried, it was rather to be inferred that 8nch substances
were deficient in this peculiar propertyÂ®,

4. After a few unsnecessful attempts, I succeeded in making the screening
power of seyeral substances, not supposed to contain iron, very evident ; the
mechanical arrangements resorted to for the purpose were similar to those
already described in my paper on the transient magnetic state, of which 8ub-
stances are susceptible, and which has been honoured by a place in the Royal
Society's Transactions; it will be unnecessary therefore to describe them
