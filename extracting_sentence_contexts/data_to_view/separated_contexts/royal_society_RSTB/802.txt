For example, in a medium-sized dog, injection of 100 c.cm. of
whipped blood will often double the output and contraction volume. In other words,
with a dog of a weight of 12 or 13 kilos., and whose blood, therefore, we may
assume to be about 1,000 c.cm. in amount (according to the usual computation that
the blood is equal to 3/gth of the body weight), the injection into the veins of an
additional volume of blood equal to 7th of the total blood of its body, may double
the amount of blood thrown out of the heart in a given time. This increase in
the“output, moreover, lasts for some time, as long, in fact, in our experiments as the
condition of the animal remains unchanged ; it is always accompanied by an increase
in the volume of residual blood, and differs, therefore, in so far from the effects of
re-injection into an animal of blood which had previously been removed. It took us a long time to distinguish clearly between increase in force of the
contractions of the heart due to increased supply of blood to the coronaries, and that
due to the action of the augmentor nerves. When the systemic blood-pressure is
below normal, injection of blood into the veins may improve the nutrition of the
heart wall to an extent which more than counterbalances the increased resistance to
contraction of the left ventricle resulting from the rise of pressure in the systemic
arteries, so that, as in the example shown in Fig. 32, the amount of residual blood in
the left ventricle is diminished.
