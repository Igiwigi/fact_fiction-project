This introduces infinite stresses at this
point which render the solution inconvenient. Now we have at our disposal nine constants; these have already been made to
satisfy the seven homogeneous equations (78), (80)-(85), and therefore we are free
to make them satisfy an eighth homogeneous equation. Choose then the constants so as to make (polynomial part of [du/dz + dw/dr] when
r = a, 2 = +c) zero, and we have

Dae + Eaâ€™c + Fact + Diac+ E'ack=0 . . . . . (86). Tf now we express all the other constants in terms of the constant E, we find ;
