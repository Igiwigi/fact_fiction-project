supported by Sraut to the extent that he finds many plants with open stomata at
night. Lastly, it has been opposed by ScHELLENBERGER, who concludes that a vast
majority of plants shut their stomata at night. My own conclusion is that in all
plants, except aquatic, marsh, and nyctitropic plants, there is a great preponderance
of nocturnal closure—such closure being not necessarily complete.

The microscopic method employed by LErrees has disadvantages which have been
already referred to. Thus, if the stomata are examined in surface section, the method
of preparation is an obvious source of error. While, if the leaf as a whole is examined,
I believe that it is not easy to distinguish partial from complete closure. These
considerations suggest that the divergence between the conclusions arrived at by
Lerrars and ScHELLENBERGER depends in part on the difficulties of the microscopic
method. On the other hand, certain facts tend to show that Lerrers’s observations
are correct. Thus among the common plants which Lerrers found to have open
stomata at night are Cyclamen persicum, Viola odorata, Eranthis hyemalis,
Erythronium, R. Ficaria, all of which oceur among those which I have found clearly
open at night. This being so I have little right to throw doubt on Lerrexp’s results,
or on the microscopic method generally.

If we turn to observations made by the hygroscopic method we again meet with
contradictions, for Stan. is in general agreement with Lerrers, while my observa-
tions are opposed to that author,
