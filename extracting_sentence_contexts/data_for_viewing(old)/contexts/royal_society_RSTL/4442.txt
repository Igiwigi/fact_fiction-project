be almost within our grasp. To have made full-sized copies of the original sketches
would have been useless, as many micrometrical measures are still wanting, and there
are many matters of detail to be worked in before they will be entitled to rank as
astronomical records, to be referred to as evidence of change, should there hereafter
be any reason to suspect it.

Much however as the discovery of these strange forms may be calculated to excite
our curiosity, and to awaken an intense desire to learn something of the laws which
give order to these wonderful systems, as yet, [ think, we have no fair ground even
for plausible conjecture; and as observations have accumulated the subject has be-
come, to my mind at least, more mysterious and more inapproachable. There has
therefore been little temptation to indulge in speculation, and consequently there
can have been but little danger of bias in seeking for the facts. When certain phe-
nomena can only be seen with great difficulty, the eye may imperceptibly be in some

degree influenced by the mind; therefore a preconceived theory may mislead, and
speculations are not without danger, On the other hand, speculations may render
important service by directing attention to phenomena which otherwise would escape
obseryation, just as we are sometimes enabled to recognize a faint object with a 8mall
instrument, having had our attention previously directed to it by an instrument of
greater power. The conjectures therefore of men of science are always to be invited
as aids during the active prosecution of research.
