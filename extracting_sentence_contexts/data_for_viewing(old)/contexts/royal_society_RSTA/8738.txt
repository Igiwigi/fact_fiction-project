special case when we are concerned only with free electrons moying in an zthereal
field free from matter their equations of motion can be derived by the variational
principle, using the integral

where ¢, A, the ordinary scalar and vector potentials, are regarded as functions of the
time and space variables only.

We now see why it is that consistent formule have been obtained by different
authors using apparently different expressions to represent the field energies. The
results are in fact all explicitly independent of any particular interpretations for these
energy expressions.

8. The general dynamical formulation of § 6 agrees with the fact that the material
media of the field have an internal constitution which enables them to resist the

setting up of the electric and magnetic polarisations by forces E+ - [7,,B] and
é
B- . [v,,, E+E,] respectively, and that in consequence of any change in the polarised

state of these media their intrinsic energy of elastic or motional type is increased by
the amount
