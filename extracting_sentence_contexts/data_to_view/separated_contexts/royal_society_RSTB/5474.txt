The observations made on the well-preserved spines have not
only confirmed previous statements as to their being flattened in the vertical plane, but
have added some structural details. No evidence is forthcoming that the appendages
had a vascular supply, though the nature of the preservation does not justify a definite
negative conclusion on this point. The fact that no stomata have been found, although
the pattern of elongated epidermal cells was more or less evident, supports the view that
stomata were absent from the spines. These negative observations are confirmatory
of views that have been expressed by previous investigators (HALLE, 1916; Epwarps,
1924) that these structures were not specialised organs of assimilation and should be
regarded as ‘‘ emergences”’ rather than “ leaves.” Some other facts give further support to this view.
