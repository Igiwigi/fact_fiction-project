My team at Newcastle was responsible for the latter. It was during :3
that project that I started to build the vision of computational electronics that was driven by .
potentially unpredictable and variable power sources rather than what had usually been seen
as the recipient of unlimited power or energy supply. I called this type of computing ‘energy-
modulated’ [1], to emphasize the fact that it was energy flow that defined the computational
action. In the following section on energy-modulated computing, I shall briefly explain its main
idea. To underpin this concept, a patent on a self-powered voltage sensor was filed in 2011 [2].
