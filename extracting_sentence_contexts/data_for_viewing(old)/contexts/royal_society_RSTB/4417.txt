implements were evolved from the rostro-carinate type, then it is only natural that
the outline of the parent form should at times make itself manifest.

It thus seems reasonable to conclude that the early palzolithic, river-drift imple-
ments are directly evolved from the more ancient rostro-carinate specimens (the
author wishes it to be clearly understood that he does not at present associate the
later Mousterian, Aurignacian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian cultures with this
evolution), and we may proceed to examine the seven implements which it is the
main purpose of this paper to describe, and to ascertain whether they support this
theory of evolution.

Before, however, proceeding to such a description it may be well to again emphasise
the fact that these seven specimens have all been found in deposits of gravel well
known as yielding numerous specimens of the earliest examples of the handiwork of
river-drift man. These seven specimens also exhibit the same colour and other
conditions of surface exhibited by the normal implements from the gravel beds,
and it appears necessary to conclude therefore that they are of the same age as the
aforesaid normal paleolithie implements.

1. The Savernake Transitional Specimen No. 1 (Plate 51, figs. 1-4).

This implement, as will be seen from the four views illustrated, possesses all the
characteristics of a rostro-carinate, as set forth earlier in this paper. The views of
the right and left lateral surfaces (figs. 1 and 2) show the well-known beak-like profile
(in the drawing of the right lateral surface the artist has tilted the implement over
