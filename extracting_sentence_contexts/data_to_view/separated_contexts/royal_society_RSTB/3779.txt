‘Two teeth, diverging
in the ripe seed as prominent horns,* obvious to the eye, apparently exaggerate the
lobing of the aperture of the envelope ; but such irregular teeth, more especially in
the form of two lateral lobes, are in no way suggestive of definite perianth-members
in the transverse plane of the diagram (cf. Lignrer and Tison, 1912, Whorl III). Two lateral bundles run up to the apex of this outer investment, just outside the
aqueous inner zone, to supply the comparatively large mass of tangentially extended
tissue in the most direct manner, and Lignier and Tison (1912, p. 143) naturally
regard them as confirmatory evidence of two component members, and, in fact, the
homologue of two stamen-traces.t On the other hand, SyKes (1910) prefers to trace
an analogy with the cupule of Lagenostoma ! * In the adult seed the cells in this region share in the general tendency to fibrous elongation, and the
“lip” processes are thus extended as slender wisps of fibrous cells and may attain a length of 5 mm.
