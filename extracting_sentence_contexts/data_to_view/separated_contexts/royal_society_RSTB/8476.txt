gamma-type and beta-type transmembrane The story revealed by TM sequences in the ERV fossil record
From the fact that gamma-type TM sequences are found is one of significant differences hidden beneath a veneer
among multiple vertebrate classes, whereas the beta-type is of similarity. The TM sequences of all Orthoretrovirinae—
limited to mammals, one might expect the gamma-type to excluding the epsilonretroviruses—share a specific domain
be more divergent as a group than the beta-type. In fact, organization and certain features such as a cysteine pair in
