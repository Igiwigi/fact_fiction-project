3 S still more efficient means of reducing the length of the epithelium is a process of

@ng, which takes place in that layer on the surface of the mucosa and in the walls
he glands themselves.
Fhis folding of the epithelium is shown in fig. 11, and it is by this means that new
Bids are formed, which take the place of those lost in the mucosa menstrualis.
‘Et is worthy of note that these new glands are formed from newly-formed surface
helium, as well as from epithelium which already functions as glandular
elium.
-§. The Behaviour of the Leucocytes.—The leucocytes seen in the earlier periods of
e VIII. are very numerous, and it is a noteworthy fact they are, almost without
eeption, found congregated in the newly-formed capillaries, or included amongst the
nasses of red blood corpuscles which will eventually be enclosed within the circulatory
m.
“Isolated wandering leucocytes apart from red blood corpuscles, at this period are
very rare indeed, and, after the new vessels are completed and all the extravasated
blood reclaimed, I have never met with a wandering leucocyte.
The actual proportion of leucocytes to red blood corpuscles within the superficial
vessels is much greater now than it ever has been before. Fig. 40 is a drawing of a
_— vessel, and the leucocytes therein reach the proportion of 47°115 ‘per
