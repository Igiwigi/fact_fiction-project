[48] and Drent et al. [103]). Others involve relatively small
sample sizes and are unlikely to be able to separate additive
genetic from confounding environmental components of
variation effectively (e.g. [104,105]), and thus likely over-esti-
mated heritabilities [96]. Much larger sample sizes than were
available in our study would be necessary to demonstrate
conclusively whether our estimate of h? differed from zero
[42], especially because for a binary trait the error variance
is difficult to separate from other components. The fact that
the upper credible interval for /° was relatively low (0.16)
gives some confidence that the true h* was indeed very low
and that we did not suffer unduly from a lack of statistical

Despite previously demonstrated links with several func- for h® would have been much wider, given that low sample

Our results found little if any support for the idea that inno-
vativeness was influenced by additive genetic effects, by
maternal effects, or by conditions in the natal nest. Instead
innovativeness varied temporally, with local environment
conditions, and with a range of individual factors including
