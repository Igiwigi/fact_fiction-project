The result left me undecided whether Mr. Maunprr had
established his case. One important point in favour of his contention was that
practically the same periodic time had been deduced from a study of magnetic storms
at Toronto by Mr. ArrHur Harvey,§ he and Mr. Maunper being ignorant of each
other’s work. A second fact in its favour was that a list of 125 magnetic storms at
Kew between 1890 and 1900, got out by myself in an absolutely unprejudiced way,
gaye 21 intervals of from 25 to 28 days, while intervals of from 21 to 24 days and 29
to 32 days numbered respectively only 7 and 9. I experienced, however, a difficulty
as to the proper mathematical basis for applying a probability caleulation. As it so
happened, the standard of disturbance accepted as defining a magnetic storm was such
that the average interval between successive Greenwich storms from 1888 to 1903 was
29 days, and that between successive Kew storms from 1890 to 1900 was 28 days,
both being intervals undesirably close to the supposed period.
