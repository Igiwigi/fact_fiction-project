to analyse the data at the order level. One should of course not
lose sight of the fact that the MetaCyc database is based on the
sequenced genomes of isolated bacteria and therefore may give
a biased picture, even though the relative abundances of phyla
in the database appear to be reasonably representative. Further-
more, the pathways in the database are limited to those that are
known and the true picture may very well be different from the
one shown here.

There were similarities in the types of pathways within
phyla (figure 1). Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, in particu-
lar, had slightly different sets of pathways compared with
each other and with the other phyla. The fact that the degra-
dation/utilization/assimilation pathways are not distributed
randomly across phyla may have consequences for C cycling.
A number of studies have indicated that the co-occurrence of
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the same phylum
tends to be higher than one would expect from random associ-
ations [49]. Were OTUs from the same phyla also to aggregate at
fine scales (the microbial habitat scale, for example), then the
distribution of degradation/utilization/assimilation pathways
would be uneven across microbial habitats. It is conceivable,
therefore, that organic molecules not being co-located with
the pathways required to decompose them may contribute to
their persistence in soil. The extent to which this affects persist-
