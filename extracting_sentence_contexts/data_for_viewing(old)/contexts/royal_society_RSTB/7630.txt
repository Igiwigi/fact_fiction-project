the reaction X—> Y or XY Y+ E. The remaining two sets are rather more difficult. To satisfy
the conditions of (iv) one may suppose that X is a catalyst for its own formation from A.
The actual reactions could be the formation of an unstable compound U by the reaction
A+X-U, and the subsequent almost instantaneous breakdown U->2X. To destroy X
at a rate proportional to Y as required in (v) one may suppose that a catalyst C is present in
small but constant concentration and immediately combines with XY, X+C-+V. The
modified catalyst reacting with Y, at a rate proportional to Y, restores the catalyst but not
the morphogen_X, by the reactions V+ Y> W, W-+C+-H, of which the latter is assumed
instantaneous.

It should be emphasized that the reactions here described are by no means those which
are most likely to give rise to instability in nature. The choice of the reactions to be discussed
was dictated entirely by the fact that it was desirable that the argument be easy to follow.
More plausible reaction systems are described in § 10.

Unstable equilibrium is not, of course, a condition which occurs very naturally. It
usually requires some rather artificial interference, such as placing a marble on the top of
a dome. Since systems tend to leave unstable equilibria they cannot often be in them. Such
equilibria can, however, occur naturally through a stable equilibrium changing into an
unstable one. For example, ifa rod is hanging from a point a little above its centre of gravity
