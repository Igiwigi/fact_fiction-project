containing similar percentages of carbon. As regards the steels of the alloy type pro-
duced by Farapay, no evidence of any distinctly superior mechanical or other qualities
has so far been detected.

Tn order, however, to test this fully and completely, a considerable series of experi-
ments would be necessary, which it is not practicable to carry out with the small amount
of material available and with specimens of such small size. It has, however, been
possible to ascertain the nature and general properties of these original specimens.
and, still more important to establish the credit due to Faranay for his remarkable
pioneer work in this field of alloy steels, having in mind, too, the early date when he
carried out the research. As the present investigation proceeded, the difficulty was
not to obtain information, much of it of interesting character, but to keep it within
reasonable compass. Facts of considerable interest were discovered, and useful sug-
gestions were derived which later may well merit further investigation on larger specimens
specially made for the purpose of more exhaustive researches. To this end the author
hopes, if circumstances permit, to have the opportunity of making some of the higher
percentage alloys of which Farapay speaks.

As to the exact number of samples of steel alloys made by Farapay, no information
is available, but it is evident from the two papers by Sropart and Farapay that the
total must have run into large numbers of experiments requiring heavy expenditure
of time and money on these researches, and spread over about five years. Binary and
ternary alloys were investigated, and altogether some sixteen elements and four other
ferrous substances are mentioned by Farapay in connection with his researches.
These, arranged alphabetically in groups, are as follows :â€”
