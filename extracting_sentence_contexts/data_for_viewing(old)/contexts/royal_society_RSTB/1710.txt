Under high powers the dark spots in the subiewlum are found to be pyriform
swellings densely filled with contents which stain deeply, and are evidently developed
as the swollen ends of the hyphe (fig. 6); the conspicuous radiating hyphe of the
sub-hymenial layer are shown to be thin-walled, multiseptate filaments, with highly
vacuolated contents, and branching in a sort of fan-like or falsely dichotomous
manner, reminding one of the growth of many filamentous alge. The contents stain
so much more deeply than do those of the thicker-walled hyphee in which they grow
and intrude as into a matrix (fig. 7), that this system of hyphe is sharply marked as
distinct.

High-power sections, taken vertically through the hymenium (fig. 8), present little
that is not known, but attention may be drawn to the facts that the young spores
are round, and that they become more and more elongated as they mature; that
the large basidia are clearly the ends of hyphal branches coming up from the sub-
hymenium ; and that many of the ends of the branching hyphe remain barren. As
fig. 9 shows, some of these barren ends grow out like paraphyses or cystidia here and
there, but I am not sure whether this is a mere accident or an expression of the fact
that, after the present crop of basidiospores is matured, these intermediate hyphee
grow forward, and develop the new hymenial layer, thus accounting for the periodic

zones of growth found in older hymenophores.t

The observation that the sub-hymenium of Sterewm hirsutum contains two kinds of
hyphz was apparently new, though the presence of a sort of laticiferous system in
