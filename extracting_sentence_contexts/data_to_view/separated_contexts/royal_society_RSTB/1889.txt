This root progressively diminishes in size as it is traced
distally by the passage of its fibres into the subjacent gelatinous substance. As no
degeneration was observed to pass from this structure into the tegmentum, or into
the posterior horn, it was evident that in this substance lay the end-nucleus of the
sensory trigeminal fibres whose cells of origin are situated in the Gasserian ganglion. That the secondary neurons arising in the gelatinous substance cross the raphé, and
are continued cerebralwards in the tegmentum pontis of the opposite side in associa-
tion with the cutaneous sensory fibres of the body and limbs, was obvious from the
fact of the experiments where section of the tegmentum cruris was followed by
anesthesia of the whole of the opposite side, including the face (Exps. 24 and 25). The symptoms following section of the trigeminal nerve and of its ophthalmic
branch have been elsewhere detailed (28 and 29). The general statement may here be made, that the common views as to the
causation of neuro-paralytic ophthalmia were not confirmed.
