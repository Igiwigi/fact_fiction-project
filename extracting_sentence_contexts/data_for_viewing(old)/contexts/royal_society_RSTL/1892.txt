* Cvvien at the time of publizhing his Anatomy of Mollusca appears to have entertained the same
theory, for he there properly describes this body as attached to the hinder part of the foot, a little below
the usual place of the operculum ; but in his Animal Kingdom he seems to have abandoned it, and
describes the animal as having no operculum, but haying a vesicular organ under its foot â€”Regne

818 MR. GRAY ON THE ECONOMY OF MOLLUSCOUS ANIMALS,

of their opercula offer some of the most constant characters for the distinction
and arrangement of families and genera; while, on the other hand, I have con-
vinced myself that systematists have been in the habit of placing too much
reliance on the mere fact of their presence or absence as a family character,
inasmuch as that cireumstance alone will scarcely prove of generic importance.
Thus in the genus Foluta, the animals of the eight or nine species which I
have examined are all destitute of opercula, except Yoluta musica, which has
an operculum of moderate size. The Olives and Mitres are in the same predi-
cament, most, of the large species being destitute of opercula, while the smaller
species of both genera are furnished with rather Jarge ones, as may be easily
seen in specimens of Oliva eburnea, O. zonalis, or Mitra striatula, in which the
animals have been dried ; and $shells in this state are not uncommon in collec-
tions. The species of Cones offer in this respect the same variations. These
observations will explain the apparent contradictions of describers, and the
frequent controversies that have taken place as to whether these and some
other genera have or have not opercula. 'That their presence or absence is not
