full colour vision at this stage

It will be observed that the ‘red’ and ‘blue-green’ mechanisms, acting together, change
colourless foveal vision to reduced (so-called ‘dichromatic’) colour vision. The ‘yellow’
and ‘blue’ mechanisms together alter the latter to full colour vision (see § 160, p. 663).

(81) The evidence for four nervous mechanisms

The supposition that there are four separate mechanisms rests on the following facts:

(1) The different colours lose colour at different visual angles; red and blue-green at
small angles; yellow and blue at larger ones.

(2) The visual angles at which yellow, green and blue-green lose colour is practically
independent of background brightness, whereas the visual angles at which violet, blue, red
and orange lose colour are affected by alterations of background brightness.

(3) Five colours have been found to undergo alterations in tint: yellow-green, green,
purple, mauve and crimson. The two former lose yellow and thus become shades of pale
blue-greens. The three latter lose blue and thus become shades of red and orange.
