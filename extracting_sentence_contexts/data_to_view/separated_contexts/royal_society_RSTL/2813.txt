It appears, therefore, that at this point, where St. Alban's Head and the Isle of
Wight interpose themselves in its course, the diurnal wave receives a check which
almost reverses its position, and makes the inequalities very different at places be-
fore and after that point. Nor does this assertion rest upon any arbitrary mode of
combining the facts, but it appears in the facts themselves. For instance, if we com-
pare the high waters at Plymouth, and at Lepe, near Southampton, we shall find
that their relation is contrary, the morning high waters being lower than the mean,
and the evening high waters higher than the mean, from June 14 to 18 at Plymouth,
and the same being the case at Lepe; although the morning tide of one place is
identical with the evening tide of the other. We may observe, that we bave here a new proof of that, of which the recent ex-
amination of the tides has supplied many proofs, that we can by no means reason
on the supposition that the waters of the ocean approximate to a level surface, or
that an elevation at one place is necessarily shared by the surrounding seas.
