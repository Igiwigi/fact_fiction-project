three visual mechanisms for making numerical discrimination
depending on the number of visual elements: for numerosities
approximately less than or equal to 4 (subitizing), 4â€”9 (serial
enumeration) and large numbers where the elements are too
crowded to parse. In this last case, a quite different mechanism
takes over. However, they also note that representations of
visual numerosities can be influenced by auditory numeros-
ities, and vice versa, suggesting that humans do indeed
represent number amodally.

6. Genetics

The fact that newborn chicks, fish and human neonates can make
numerical discriminations suggests that this capacity does not
arise as a result of interaction with the environment, but is inher-
ited though subsequent interaction with environment doubtless
modifies and refines the operation of this mechanism. It is also
the case, as Butterworth [2] points out, that individual differ-
ences in numerical abilities have a substantial genetic
