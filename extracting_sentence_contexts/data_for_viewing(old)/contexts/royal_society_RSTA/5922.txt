Onsager took a further step by recognizing that the behaviour (1.5) requires the fluid to
develop singularities as v > 0 in a mathematically precise sense. Specifically, for (1.5) to occur
on sequences of Navier-Stokes solutions, the pth-order absolute structure functions cannot satisfy
a bound of the type

for any ¢» > p/3, p= 3 and a constant C independent of viscosity. This assertion, originally stated
by Onsager [24] about weak solutions of the Euler equation and in the slightly more restrictive
setting of Hélder spaces, has since been rigorously proved [25-27]. In fact, energy dissipation
must vanish as viscosity goes to zero for any family of solutions {u"},.9 which are uniformly
bounded in the Besov space! LP(0,T; By! Bt (74) for p = 3 [28]. Thus, Kolmogorov’s 1941 theory
corresponds to turbulent solutions possessing the maximal degree of smoothness consistent with
their ability to anomalously dissipate energy.

It is well known that real fluids do not conform exactly to Kolmogorov’s prediction.?
Intermittency, or spottiness/non-uniformity of the velocity’ s roughness and the energy
dissipation rate, result in deviations of the scaling exponents ay (and ¢,) from a linear behaviour
