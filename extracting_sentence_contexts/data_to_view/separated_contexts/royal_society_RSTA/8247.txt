We shall therefore have to bear the faults
of the classification in mind in deciding what transformations are the most general. We proceed now to an individual discussion of all the most general transformations
and of some specially interesting particular cases besides ; and we shall find the reverse
transformation in each case. In addition we shall illustrate the usefulness of the work
by deriving some geometrical facts of quite general interest. Notation.—For purposes of reference we introduce a more systematic notation for
the transformations. We shall use the symbol {2, 7, n} to denote a quadric transforma-
tion in which the ®-surfaces and ’-surfaces are of order r, and of which the reverse
transformation is of order x.
