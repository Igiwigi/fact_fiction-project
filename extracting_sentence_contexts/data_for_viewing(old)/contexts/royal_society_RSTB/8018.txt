the abdominal integuments, to be free for a part of their course, we shall then have a pen-
dulous organ closely resembling the genital member of the opposite sex, an arrangement
which actually obtains in Hyena crocuta.â€™ Watson believed the clitoris of the elephant, like

that of the hyena, to be comparable in size with the penis of the male. This is not really so;
the clitoris is large, even for the size of the animal, but the penis is very much larger and
more extensible. To what extent the clitoris of the elephant is erectile is unknown; that it
is sensitive is obvious from observation of captive elephants.

Notwithstanding its usually sluggish movements, the elephant is in fact a supple and
agile animal. It is sometimes forgotten that its usefulness in the Burma teak forests depends
not only on its strength but on its ability to work in very difficult terrain. The writer has
seen wild African elephants climb with ease up rough slopes which he would have judged
impassable to them, and which would perhaps have deterred an agile pony. In forest,
elephants disturb the vegetation very little as they move, and on one occasion when
accurate observation was possible, a group of elephants was found to have passed over
a fallen tree trunk, an obstacle just 3 ft high, without scratching its smooth bark. There is
therefore no occasion for surprise at the degree of agility called for on the part of the male
elephant during copulation as described by Slade.

The length of the urogenital canal, together with the narrowness of the passage from it
to the vagina, as it appears in most of the existing accounts, has led to the supposition by
