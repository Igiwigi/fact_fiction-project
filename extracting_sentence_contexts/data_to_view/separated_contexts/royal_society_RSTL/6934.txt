There have
been great river-floods and great changes, but no interruption in the snccession of life
from the time of the great extinct mammals to our own times. There are still serious
difficulties in the way of explaining the cause of the disappearance of s0 many of these
large Mammalia ; but a sufficient number remain to attest the direct descent of a portion
of the old fauna to our day. The Reindeer, the Bos primigentus, the Aurochs, are
amongst those which survived all the successive changesF. Why the larger Pachyderms
should not also haye survived we cannot explain, we can only admit the fact, which is
the more remarkable from the non-extinction of other classes. The change of climatal
conditions could scarcely have been the sole cause, as that would affect one class equally
with the other; and besides, as the climate at this time presented no extreme character,
they could, as the changes progressed, have found, by migration or limitation, as with
the other animals, places still adapted to their former condition. But by far the most
remarkable and convincing feature in the case is the transmission from the quaternary
period of 80 large a proportion of the small and delicate land and freshwater shells.
