Subjecting the alburnum to a slight degree
of pressure at this period, I found that a considerable quan-
tity of liquid, being apparently the true sap of the tree, issued
out laterally through the medullary processes, as well as
longitudinally through the cellular substance of the alburnum:
but the tubes of it continued empty, and their position was
marked by depressions of the surface of the extravasated
fluid. I endeayoured to ascertain, what proportion of water
a given quantity of the alburnum of such oak trees contained
at this period ; and I found that 1000 parts lost by drying
only 371 parts: which is not more than the weight of the
water that the cellular substance appears capable of containing,
entirely independent of the tubes. That the tubes, never-
theless, are not always empty, but that they act at other
periods of the year as reservoirs for the sap, I have given an
opinion in a former communication ; and I am now in pos-
s8ession of facts which prove them to perform this office, even
in the heart wood, to a much greater extent than I had ever at
any former period suspected; and which incline me to believe,
that the durability of the heart wood, as well as of the albur-
num of the oak, will be found to depend to a great extent
upon the period in which the tree is felled: but I propose to
make my observations upon these points the subject of a
future communication. I am, my dear Sir, &c. T.
