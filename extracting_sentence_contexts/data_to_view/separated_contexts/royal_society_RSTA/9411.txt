For sodium the value 0000224, determined by us in some preliminary experiments
by a new method, has been utilized. This method, which will be described in a later paper, did not indicate any marked
change in the coefficient over the range 0° C. to 95° C. For low temperature a coefficient of decrease of the same order as that of
cadmium was assumed, a procedure which is justified by the fact that the
coefficient of expansion is proportional to the atomic heat, as shown by GRUNEISEN,
and at low temperature the atomic heat curves of sodium and cadmium are
similar. Nernst and Lrypemann*™ adopt a different procedure, basing their method on
GRUNEISEN’s observation that the coefficient of expansion is proportional to the atomic
heat ; they obtain the approximate relation

C,—G, = GFA stp keane oe

where A is a constant characteristic of the substance which can be deduced from
measurements of the compressibility and coefficient of expansion made at one tempe-
rature,

In the cases of Al, Ag, Pb, and Cu the values so obtained are compared with the values
calculated by means of equation (5), which are utilized in all subsequent comparisons
of theory and experiment in this paper. ;

It is shown in Part IT. of this paper that no one of the theoretical formule hitherto
published is capable of representing the atomic heat-temperature curves over the
entire range. Since data based on the experimental observations are necessary to
test any theory, we summarise below the values, at convenient intervals of tempera-
ture, of the atomic heat read from curves which we believe represent the most
probable paths through the observations of Nernst at liquid air and hydrogen
temperatures; of Dewar at 50° C. abs. and through our .own numberst from
100° C. abs. to 400° C. abs.
