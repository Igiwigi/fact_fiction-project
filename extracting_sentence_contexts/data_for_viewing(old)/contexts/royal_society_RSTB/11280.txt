A recent study of Benavides-Varela et al. [21] further
examined this issue by testing 30 right hemisphere patients
on a comprehensive battery of numerical abilities (numerical
activities of daily living, NADL, [22]), and a variety of neu-
ropsychological tests. Patients performed below the cut-offs
in number comprehension, transcoding and written oper-
ations (particularly in subtraction and multiplication).
Lesion analyses also showed that typical spatial errors (e.g.
omissions of the left-most digits, misalignment, number
inversions, etc.) were associated with extensive lesions in
fronto-temporoparietal areas, frequently associated with
neglect. By contrast, purely arithmetical errors (e.g. failure
to recall basic number facts, to carry, to borrow, etc.) were
related to more confined lesions in the lower parietal lobe,
particularly in the right angular gyrus and its proximity.
Regression models revealed that spatial errors were mainly
predicted by composite measures of visuo-spatial attentional
and representational abilities. By contrast, specific errors of
arithmetical nature were not predicted by visuo-spatial abil-
ities. Importantly, and in contrast with traditional views,
the proportion of arithmetical errors in this group of patients
was much higher than that of spatial errors across various
calculation tasks. The reverse pattern was true for number
comprehension tasks assessing numerical comparison, and
number line estimation. This distribution of errors may of
