Therefore, at short times
behaviour of kinetic energy at each spatial point can be approximately described by formula (6.5). It was shown that in a spatially uniform case, if initial kinetic energies, corresponding to degrees
of freedom of the unit cell, are equal then their equilibrium values are also equal. Note that this
fact does not guarantee that kinetic energies will remain equal during heat transport. In particular,
in paper [11], it was shown that in heat-conducting harmonic crystals the kinetic energies are
generally different even if their initial values are equal. In the present paper, anharmonic effects were neglected.
