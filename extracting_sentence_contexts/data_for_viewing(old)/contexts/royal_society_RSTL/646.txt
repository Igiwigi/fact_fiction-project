of flame, and that marked on our common mercurial scale,
is 80 great that the addition of a few degrees of heat pro-
bably does not diminish perceptibly the cooling power of a
metallic surface, with regard to flame.

By diminishing the diameter of the air canals, their power
of passing the explosion is 80 much diminished that their depth
and circumference may be brought extremely low. I found
that flame would not pass through a canal of the ; of an
inch in diameter, when it was & of an inch deep, and forming
a cylinder of only Z of an inch in circumference; and a num-
ber of apertures of +; of an inch are safe when their depth
is equal to their diameter. It is evident from these facts,
that metallic doors, or joinings in lamps, may be easily made
8afe by causing them to project upon and fit closely to paral-
lel metallic surfaces.
