However, the total damping
predicted by the two methods differs significantly except when the roll amplitude goes to zero
and the damping is mainly due to wave radiation. The difference between the total damping
and the wave radiation damping in the nonlinear hybrid method is mainly due to vortex
shedding, i.e. eddy-making damping. It is a well-known fact that viscous shear stresses have
a small influence on roll damping. The eddy-making damping depends on the instantaneous
positions, velocities and strengths of shed vorticity. The latter fact can be qualitatively indicated
by using a thin free-shear layer and boundary layer method as presented by Faltinsen &
Pettersen [23].
