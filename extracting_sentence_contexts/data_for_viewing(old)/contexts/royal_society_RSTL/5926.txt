In this boring, the samples of soil down to the end of the 53rd foot from the surtace
of the ground, were extracted by turning the screw in the oil exactly a foot deep each
time. The remainder of the depth was jumped through, and the samples brought up
were estimated from the contents of the bottom tube in the screw.


66 MR. HORNER ON THE ALLUVIAL LAND OF EGYPT.

Review of the chief facts made known by the Excavations, Shafts and Borings.

On examining the results of the ninety-five probings of the alluvial land which I
have described in this second part of my memoir, we find,â€”
1st. That the alluvium is of two principal kinds; first, and chiefly, an argillaceous
earth or loam, more or less mixed with fine sand, of various shades of colour, being the

either side, but chiefly from the Libyan range. ,
2ndly. That the Nile sediment found at the lowest depth reached is very sinular in
