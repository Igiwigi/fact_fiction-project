In that case, the resolution is measured by measuring the spacing between two calibration
peaks and dividing the spectral value by the number of pixels. The third and final case is when
the calibration peak is thinner than a pixel. In that case, similarly as for the second case, the
spacing between two calibration peaks is measured and divided by the number of pixels but the
uncertainty is increased by the fact that the sensor cannot differentiate between two emission
peaks that would be on the same pixel. Using the Hgâ€”Ar calibration lamp, the resulting image and spectrum taken with the prototype
are shown in figure 7. From the spectrum extracted, four different peaks can be identified, two
single emission peaks and one doublet.
