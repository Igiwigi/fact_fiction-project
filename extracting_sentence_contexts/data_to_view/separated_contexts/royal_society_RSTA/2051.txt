Recently, the auxiliary field formalism has been applied to classical fractional kinetic equations
[28,29] as well as a general quantum master equation [30]. It has been found that the auxiliary field
introduced in the action may actually be a weak invariant of the corresponding master equation. This fact indicates the existence of a certain deeper structure that must be related to the symmetry
principle behind kinetic theory. Understanding such a principle may, in turn, cast fresh light on
non-equilibrium thermodynamics even at the classical level. In this paper, the action principle and weak invariants are studied in the context of classical
kinetic theory.
