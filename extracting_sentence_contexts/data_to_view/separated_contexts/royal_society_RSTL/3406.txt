Additional Observations. Received June 17,â€”Read June 18, 1840.

431. Should the facts made known in the foregoing memoir regarding the essential
portion of the mammiferous ovum be confirmed, it will of course be inferred that the
same changes take place, and for the same purpose, in other ova. Having however
been s0 fortunate as to discover that s8uch really is the case, I think it proper to
record my further observations; more especially as some of them happen to have
been made on ova which, when compared with the ovum of Mammalia, seem at first,
sight to present an important difference. 432.
