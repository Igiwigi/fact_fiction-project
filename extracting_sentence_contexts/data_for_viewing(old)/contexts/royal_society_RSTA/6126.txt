oN > aTâ€™. (4.1)

Below I will sometimes write the rh.s. of this equation as By.

Unfortunately, in general it is impossible to have the local EPs of all units = 0 in an arbitrary
unit structure, even if one uses a quasi-statically slow process. Indeed, the unit structure itself,
independent of any other properties of the rate matrix, may mean that it is impossible to have all
local EPs = 0.1

This might seem to imply that we cannot lower-bound the EP as By. However, recall that in
general there are many different unit structures that all apply to the same CTMC. We are free to
choose among those unit structures. And as it turns out, no matter what the CTMC is, we can
always choose the unit structure in a way that guarantees that equation (4.1) does in fact hold.

I prove this result in several steps. First, in electronic supplementary material, appendices
F and G, I derive a set of lower bounds on EP that always apply, no matter what the unit
structure. These lower bounds are summarized in electronic supplementary material, proposition
F.1, and are my first main result. These bounds are not in the form of equation (4.1) though; while
important in their own right, they do not yet achieve our goal.

On the other hand, in general we can represent any CTMC with a unit structure of height 2.
(For example, we can do that by combining all coordinates that are not members of a root node
of Iyv+, into one, overarching unit.) In electronic supplementary material, appendix F, I derive a
corollary of electronic supplementary material, proposition F.1, telling us that equation (4.1) holds
for any such unit structure of height 2. This is my second main result.!2
