with those particles of oxygen which were, immediately before, in divided relation to
both it and the hydrogen : the oxide is removed by the acid, and a fresh surface of
contact between the zinc and water is presented, to renew and repeat the action.

950. Practically, the state of tension is best relieved by dipping a metal which has
less attraction for oxygen than the zinc, into the dilate acid, and making it also touch
the zine. The force of chemical affinity, which has been influenced or polarized in the
particles of the water by the dominant attraction of the zinc Å¿or the oxygen, is then
transferred, in a most extraordinary manner, through the two metals, 80 as to re-enter
upon the circuit in the electrolytic condactor, which cannot convey or transfer it
without decomposition as the metals can ; or rather, probably, it is exactly balanced
and neutralized by the force which at the same moment completes the combination of
the zinc with the oxygen of the water. The forces, in fact, of the two particles which
are acting towards each other, and which are therefore in opposite directions, are the
origin of the two opposite forces, or directions of force, in the current. They are of
necessity equivalent to each other. Being transferred forward in contrary directions,
they produce what is called the yoltaic current : and it seems to ie impossible to
resist the idea that it must be preceded by a sfate of tension in the fluid, and between
the fluid and the zinc ; the first consequence of the affinity of the zinc for the oxygen
of the water.

951. I have songht carefully for indications of a state of tension in the electrolytic
conductor; and conceiving that it might produce something like structure, either
before or during its discharge, I endeayoured to make this evident by polarized light.
