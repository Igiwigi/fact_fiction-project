apparent in figure 5 is an order of magnitude greater than
the measurement error for the various sensors (ยง3a), we con-
clude that our steppe eagle did not consistently adjust its
airspeed and/or wing span in relation to updraft strength
during straight and interthermal glides. There is therefore no
strong evidence in our data to suggest that steppe eagles are
capable of estimating updraft strength.

(d) Adjustment of airspeed in combined headwinds
and updrafts

It is possible, in principle, that some of the noise in figure 5
might be attributable to the fact that airspeed is expected to
be optimized jointly, rather than separately, in respect of
updraft and headwind strength. This can be crudely tested by
regressing airspeed on headwind and updraft speed together,
which results in models with rather higher predictive power
(0.20 < R* < 0.34 for the three aerodynamic models [17,37,39]
at maximal and optimal span). This approach offers some evi-
dence that the airspeed is optimized jointly in respect of
headwind and updraft speed, because the variation explained
by updraft speed having first controlled for headwind is greater
