as an undeniable ‘fact of life’. In particular, quantum measurements are famously regarded as
irreversible [1]. This irreversibility is a reason why modelling of quantum measurements using
unitary dynamics is sometimes viewed as controversial. Of course, decoherence [2-5] (now
usually included as an essential ingredient of a fully consummated measurement process) is
rightly regarded as effectively irreversible. The arrow of time it dictates can be tied to the dynamical
second law [6,7].

Our aim here is to point out that, over and above the familiar irreversibility exemplified
by decoherence that stems from the second law, and in contrast with the classical physics,
irreversibility of an even more fundamental kind arises in quantum physics in the course
of measurements. We shall explore it by turning ‘reversibility’ from an abstract concept that
characterizes equations of motion to an operationally defined property: We shall investigate when
the evolution of a measured system and a measuring apparatus can be, at least in principle,
