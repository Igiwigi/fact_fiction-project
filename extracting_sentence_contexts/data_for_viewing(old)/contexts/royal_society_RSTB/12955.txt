Figure 2. Variation in the degree of neural plasticity in response to cues of developmental support. (a) Most studies to date have focused on the fact that there is
plasticity in cognitive development in response to cues of social support (figure 1a); however, it is likely that this degree of plasticity varies. The dots and lines show
a genotype, population or species reaction norm: the dotted lines indicate a less plastic genotype and the solid lines indicate a more responsive or more plastic
genotype. (b) Variation in the degree of plasticity can be used to measure associated costs and benefits of this plastic response. For example, contrasting the
performance of genotypes from (a) in the high environment would reveal a cost of the ability to be plasticâ€”does the more plastic genotype suffer a fitness
trade-off when in the high-quality environment relative to the less plastic genotype that is expressing the equivalent phenotype? Contrasting the performance
of these genotypes in the low environment would reveal a cost of mismatch (or a benefit of plasticity): does being unresponsive to the environment result in
a phenotype poorly matched to those conditions?
