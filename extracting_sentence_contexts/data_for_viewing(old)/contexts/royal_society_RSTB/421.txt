tion of the head towards the source of danger is situated below the focus for the hip—
below because, as will be seen, what in the upper part of the hemisphere is horizontally
directed in the Bonnet Monkey becomes vertically arranged in the Orang.

Ill. Integration of Foci.

The extraordinarily integrated character ot representation of individual movements
in the several foci thus observed is of such extreme importance in elucidating the
mode of localisation of function in the brains of the highest animals, the main object
of the present research, that, we shall now examine their arrangement in successive
detail from this standpoint.

The most important facts to notice in the comparison of the representation of the
Anthropoids and Man with that in the Macacque and similar Monkeys, the highest
animals on which experiments on the brain have hitherto been conducted, are that—

1. Instead of the excitable area of the cortex being continuous, it is (in the Orang)
much interrupted by spaces from which no effect could be obtained even by the
application of strong stimuli.

The inexcitable areas are indicated on fig. 8, and it will be noticed that they
separate the areas of representations of the larger divisions of the body, and do not
separate those for the segments of such divisions.

2. Reference to the figures shows also that a large part of the cortex generally
