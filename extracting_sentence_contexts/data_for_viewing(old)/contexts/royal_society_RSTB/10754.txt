Primate evolution has been dominated, as much as anything, by unusually large
brains [1]. Over the past four decades, many explanations for the evolution of large
brains have been proposed. Broadly, these explanations divide into four major
themes, each with many sub-hypotheses of their own: genetic explanations (pri-
mates have large brains because a particular gene mutation allows them to grow
large brains), developmental explanations (primates have large brains because
their extended periods of parental investment allow them to grow large brains),
ecological explanations (primates evolved large brains in order to cope with
demanding environmental conditions), and social explanations (there is some-
thing intrinsically complex about primate sociality that requires a large brain).
In many respects, the main problem associated with understanding why large
brains have evolved has been the fact that there is an embarrassment of riches:
there is empirical evidence to support every hypothesis. However, the fact that evi-
dence can be adduced in favour of conceptually very different, mutually
incompatible, explanations should alert us to the fact that something is amiss.
Either there are confounding statistical issues such that we struggle to tease
apart the causal relationships between a suite of highly correlated traits or there
are conceptual issues stemming from the construction of alternative explanations.
