Hierarchical matrix representations may be classified along two axes: one describing the block
structure of the matrix, and the other describing the form of the representation of the low-rank
data within the blocks.

Figure 6 shows three sample blocking structures. The first structure, called a ‘weak-
admissibility’ blocking, is perhaps the simplest, in which each off-diagonal low-rank block
touches the diagonal. This simple subdivision of the blocks is convenient and attractive for
implementation. But, not unexpectedly, it suffers from the fact that very large ranks may be
needed to achieve acceptable accuracy for many applications, particularly in three-dimensional
problems. ‘Standard-admissibility’ blocking, also called ‘strong-admissibility’ blocking, further
refines the blocks using an admissibility criterion for determining whether a block should be
further refined. When the matrix comes from a spatial discretization, the admissibility condition
is naturally geometric in nature and depends on the separation between the cluster of nodes
corresponding to the rows of the block and the cluster corresponding to the columns of the block.
If these two clusters are sufficiently far away the interaction between them is smooth and therefore
representable with a low-rank representation of bounded rank. Small blocks are stored in their
dense form. In practice, block refinement stops at block sizes that are determined by the hardware
and cache sizes. The middle and right matrix block structures of figure 6 come from different
admissibility criteria. The middle matrix clusters nodes along a one-dimensional axis, which may
be curved, and measures distance along that axis. This results in a structure where the blocks
