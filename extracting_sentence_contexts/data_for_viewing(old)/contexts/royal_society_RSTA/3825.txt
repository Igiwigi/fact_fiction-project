solution. Competitive techniques all perturb the molecule more. For example, in optical tweezers, : =
the molecule of interest is often tethered to a long piece of DNA [1-3]. In atomic force microscopy, [3
the object of interest is chemically or physically bound to a substrate [4,5]. In convex lens-induced : =

application and the fact that the trapping forces need not be electrokinetic—any available force
will do—we adopt the more generic name of feedback trap.

The feedback trap periodically measures the position of an object and then calculates and
applies a force to keep the particle in the field of view. The action of the feedback loop creates
a virtual potential that can confine a particle or force it to perform more complicated motion.

This use of feedback to change qualitatively the dynamics of a system (from free diffusion to
potential motion) is very much in keeping with the spirit of the ‘creative interaction of physics
and control theory’ that has been a focus of cybernetical physics, or cyberphysics [24,25]. The tools
resulting from this creative interaction have unique capabilities and have led to investigations of
fundamental issues at the intersection of thermodynamics and information theory.
