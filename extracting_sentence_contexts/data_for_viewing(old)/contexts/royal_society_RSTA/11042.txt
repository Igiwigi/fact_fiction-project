Tue experiments recorded in the following pages were begun nearly five years ago,
at a time when opinion was still much divided as to the atomic weight of cobalt and
nickel. It seemed to me that it would be a step in advance if it could be settled
which of the two is the greater, for while perhaps the majority of chemists represented
the atomic weight of cobalt as greater than that of nickel, some still assigned to them
both the same value, while Menpettere* did not hesitate to invert the order by
making Co = 58°5 and Ni = 59. After taking into account all the best evidence on
the subject, it appears certain that the atomic weight of cobalt is greater than that of
nickel, but the fact remains that the values differ from each other by an amount
which is less than the difference between any other two well established atomic
weights, the respective numbers being variously represented by different authorities
as follows :—
