the remarkable difference in behaviour between samples of equal weight, some of which
build up to detonation and some of which fail to detonate, cannot be attributed to any very
obvious differences of a chemical or physical nature. The most likely point of difference
between samples, which behave so differently to thermal activation, is in the geometrical
location of individual centres of chemical activity. It may be suggested that, in the powder,
various crystallites are decomposing at more or less steady rates, once their decomposition
has begun. In the case of samples of lead azide which fail to detonate, the fact that chemical
decomposition has occurred can be clearly detected under the microscope by the blackening
of the crystals, produced by the heating process. Detonation will not occur, apparently,

unless the energy liberated by chemical action within any given volume is sufficient to
build up a detonation wave. If this view is justified, then dilution of an initiator with inert
material, which decreases the amount of energy available in any specified volume, should
appreciably modify the above limits of temperature for 100 and 0°% ignitions.
