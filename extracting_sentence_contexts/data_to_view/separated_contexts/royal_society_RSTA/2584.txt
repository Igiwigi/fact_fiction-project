Finally,
focused melt transport through a crystal mush may explain the occurrence of vertical magmatic
fabrics in gabbros from the top third of fast-spreading lower oceanic crust. Such fabrics have
been documented both in Pacific lower crust [36,44] and in the Oman ophiolite [42,81,82], and are
defined predominantly by aligned plagioclase defining both a sheeted dyke-parallel foliation and
approximately vertical lineation. Although some workers argue that the fabrics record downward
flow of cumulates produced in the overlying axial melt lens (e.g. [83-86]), the fact that the deeper,
layered gabbros are more primitive than the foliated gabbros, and that, in contrast to the layered
gabbros below, the foliated gabbros are not layered, makes this scenario unlikely. Instead, we
argue that the fabrics record the focused upward transport of melt through the mush, with the
shear stress along the melt-mush interface leading to the alignment of the crystal framework
surrounding the melt channel [36,42,82]. In summary, melt transport in the mid-ocean ridge crystal mush occurs both by porous and
focused flow.
