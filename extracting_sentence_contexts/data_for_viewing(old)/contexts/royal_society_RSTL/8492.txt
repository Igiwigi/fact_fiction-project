as the original curye of the order mz. The transformed curve in a, y, 2, =1?, v%, w* may
in particular cases reduce itself to a curye of the order m twice repeated; but it is
important to observe that here, taking the single curve of the order m2 as the transformed
curye, this has no longer the same deficiency as the original curve; and in particular
the curves represented by the modular equation in its four seyeral forms, writing therein
8uccessively wu, v; 4, v*; W, v*; w, v*, =o, y, are not curyes of the same deficiency.

73. The question may be looked at as follows: the quantities which enter rationally
into the elliptic-function formule are *, *=1f, v5; if a modular equation (#, v)"=0
led to the transformed equation (#*, v*)”=0, then to a given value of v* would corre-
pond 8 values of u, therefore 8» yalues of v, giving the 8ame number, 8», yalues of z*;
that is, the values of »* corresponding to a given value of u* would group themselves in
eights corresponding to the 8 yalues of v. There is in fact no such grouping ; the
equations are (u, v)"=0, (+5, v*"=0; to a given value of 4u* correspond 8 values of u,
and therefore 8» values of v, but these give in eights the s8ame yalue of 25, 80 that the
number of values of v* is. =».

74. I consider the case 4=3: here, writing &, y for u, v, we haye here the sextic curye

I. —#+22y(a%*—1)=0;
and it is easy to see that the remaining forms wherein , y denote u?, v*; uf, v%; and wi, of
respectively, are derived herefrom as follows; viz.
W. (/—#& —day(ay—1lY=0, that is
Y'+64%*+a*—4ay(a%*+1)=0;
