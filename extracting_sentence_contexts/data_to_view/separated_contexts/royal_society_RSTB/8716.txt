Moreover, they pro-

On the basis of this observation, we recorded the EEG neural entrainment in correspondence with resonance fre-

That is, the envelope spectrum of these patterns does not con- approach to provide insight to the quality of the sound trans-

found in Western music, these rhythmic patterns are expected [43], such as the perception of beat and meter.
