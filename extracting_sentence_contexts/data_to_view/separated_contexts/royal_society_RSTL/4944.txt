If
it be faid that his way did not lye through Tomos (or
Temeſware), to this it may be anſwered, that he crofſ-
ed the ſame latitudes ; to which it may be added, that
there was no Euxine Sea to mitigate the ſeverity of
the cold. I muſt likewiſe here make another obſervation,
that it does not appear either from Ovid, who is ſo
very minute in every particular relative to this coun=
try, or from any other traveller, that there are high
mountains in the neighbourhood of Tomos.

'Tournefort was on the Black Sea, in the beginning
of April, and dwells much upon the very fine weather
during the time he continued upon it. He ob-

ſerves, however, that, in the time of Conſtantine, the
Areight oppoſite to Byzantium was frozen over ; and

that i in the year 401 the Euxine Sea was covered with
ice, for twenty days together, Thele faCts, therefore,
truck him, as extraordinary. Mottraye was in Crim Tartary, in the year 1711,
during the months of Noveraber and December ; who
is alſo entirely ſilent, with regard to any uncommon
effeQs of cold,

Theſe are all the travellers, whoſe' works I have
looked into, or could procure on this occaſion. Ido
not take upon myſelf to ſay, that there may not be
others, , which have eſcaped me; but I ſhould not
ſuppoſe the number to be great, as the Euxine Sea,
and its neighbourhood, neither anſwers to the Euro-
pean traveller, in point of curiofity or commerce.
