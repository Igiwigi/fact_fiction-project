BOWER ON THE MORPHOLOGY

Thus, in giving to Mohria and Aneimia a more independent position, spore-numbers,
anatomy, and antheridial characters run parallel. The outcome of HEtm’s comparison of Antheridia, together with other details of the
prothallus, is to show that, with the exception of Mohria and Aneimia,* all Ferns
with oblique annulus fall into his type A, all those with vertical or approximately
vertical annulus conform to his type B. This is a most important fact as regards
systematic arrangement, whatever our views may be as to the origin of a correspon-
dence in characters so little related to one another as the position of the annulus and
the structure and dehiscence of the antheridium. We see that a comparison of
features selected by an independent author as the most constant of the Gametophyte
leads to a grouping substantially similar to that at which we have arrived by com-
parison of the sorus and sporangia, for the Simplices and Gradatee fall into type A,
and the Mixtee into type B.

Our division of the Ferns on the basis of sporangium and sorus will thus stand the
test of collateral comparisons on other grounds, these even lead to a measure of direct
support. I therefore definitely propose that the order Filices should be divided into
three sub-orders :—

SIMPLICES.
