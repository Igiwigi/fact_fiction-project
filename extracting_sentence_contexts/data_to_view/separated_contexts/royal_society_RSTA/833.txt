Any experiment of any complexity usually involves a theory or some abstract
relationship predicted by theory, and from a theorist’s point of view an experiment ‘maps out’ or
confirms the assumed theory. In this sense, an experiment represents a theoretical structure. From
a dual point of view, however, an experimentalist might consider that their observations are self-
evident facts and a theory merely compactly represents these data. For example, data points fall
approximately on a line and the theorist represents this as a linear relationship. This suggests a
kind of dualism in which either point of view should be equally correct as to which is the ‘real
thing’ and which is its set of representations.
