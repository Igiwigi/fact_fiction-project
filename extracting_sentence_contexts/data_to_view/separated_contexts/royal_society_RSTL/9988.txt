Of lime the land would lose about twice as much in the animal in-
crease as in milk, or as in wheat or barley grain, but, perhaps, nob more than one-tenth
as much as in hay. Lastly, of potash an acre would yield only a fraction of a pound
in animal increase, six or eight times as much in milk, perhaps twenty or thirty times
as much in wheat or barley grain, and more than one hundred times as much in hay. The loss to the land in the animal increase is, in fact, chiefly in phosphate of lime,
in amount varying from 5 to 10 lbs. per acre. In milk the loss is higher in phos-
Phorie acid, less in lime, and more in potash.
