This anatomist believed that they terminated in the third
lobe of the prostate, and not in the caput gallinaceum, as ayerred by MoRGAGNI and
SanToORINI. In this, however, as I shall have occasion to show, he was mistaken. The accounts given of the distribution of the fibres in the prostate are few in number,
from the fact that the authors who have turned their attention to the anatomy of the
gland have for the most part described either its microscopical structure or pathological
conditions. Eris regards the prostate as being. essentially a muscular body, con-
sisting of circular or orbicular involuntary fibres, which are directly continuous behind
with the circular fibres of the bladder, and in front with the circular fibres of the
membranous portion of the urethra. It is, in his estimation, © only a largely developed
portion of the circular muscular layer that invests all the urethra behind the bulb, or
the spongy portion.” The few longitudinal fibres which, according to ELLIs, occur on
the upper surface of the prostate, are, he says, derived from the external layer of the
bladder, and can scarcely be said to form part of the gland.
