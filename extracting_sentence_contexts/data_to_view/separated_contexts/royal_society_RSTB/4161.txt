Dasyrus and Macropus. In Cynognathids there is a bone agreeing exactly with the mammalian vomer in
its anterior end, which posteriorly joins the basisphenoid and has exactly the relations
of the undoubted parasphenoid of the lower Therapsids. The absence of knowledge of the anterior part of the palate in Gorgonopsids leaves
an important gap in this series, for the resemblance of the palatally exposed lower
edge of the parasphenoid in Lycosaurus to the vomer in Cynognathids, although it is,
I think, sufficient when taken with other facts to support their complete homology,
may not be convincing to every one. In any case, the certain persistence of a large parasphenoid in so many groups of
Therapsids, and its probable occurrence in all, renders it very improbable that the
bone should have completely disappeared in mammals. The whole of this evidence taken together seems to me to support Broomâ€™s view
of the homology of the mammalian vomer, although it is not yet quite conclusive.
