General Introduction.

THE present paper is an attempt to interpret, in terms of the cell-metabolism,
the morphological changes exhibited by the actively secreting cell under natural
conditions. For this purpose I have selected the ovarian egg. In no other cell are
the structural changes more evident or their apparent correlation with the cell-
activity more striking. The definite limits to the period of secretive activity and the
fact that the products of secretion are stored up in the cell enable us to compare the
appearances presented by the cell-structures at varying and easily recognisable phases
of the cell-activity. Further, we can compare eggs in which a considerable quantity
of yolk is formed unaided with those which form but little or have it partially formed
for them. Finally, we are able in many cases to follow the gradual divergence from
a common stock and structure of nutritive cells and definitive ova. Not only are we
thus provided with exceptionally favourable opportunities for a comparative study of
the egg under very different, but perfectly definite, physiological conditions, but the
structural changes accompanying these conditions—the growth and varying form of
the germinal vesicle, the behaviour of the chromatin and nucleolus, the appearance
of the yolk nucleus and of yolk formation—all these constitute a wealth of morpho-
logical evidence as to the relative significance of the various cell-structures in the
cell-metabolism.
