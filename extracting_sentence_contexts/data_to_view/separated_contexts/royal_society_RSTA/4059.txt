Similar structures have been described in lichens. In view of the results that some lichens
also have superhydrophobic external and internal surfaces, they may represent a second lineage
that developed such adaptations [146,147]. In fact, only the fungal partner exhibits hydrophobic
surface characteristics, which points to fungi as a huge group of terrestrial organisms that most
probably colonized land in a close association with plants. Today, there are quite a number of
species known that exhibit superhydrophobic surfaces (see above). Slime moulds (Mycetozoa) are a group of unrelated Protista, sometimes called social amoeba.
