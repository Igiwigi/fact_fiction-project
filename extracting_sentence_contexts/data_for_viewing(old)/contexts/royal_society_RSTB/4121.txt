DR. J. C. WILLIS ON THE ENDEMIC FLORA OF CEYLON. 319

The last two figures are equal, but we are dealing here only with seven species, five of
which are exceptions to the rule.

It is thus clearly evident that the rule that we enunciated above, that the order
of rarity is Ceylon, Ceylon and Peninsular India, Wider dispersal, holds throughout
the comparison with the most extraordinary regularity. Though there are a number
of individual exceptions in the genera, as would be expected, for all species cannot be
at the same exact degree of adaptation, nor have had the same favourable or
unfavourable chances, the rule in any group of more than about 15 species comes
out with the regularity of Mendel’s law, especially when we consider that we are
dealing with estimates, and not directly with actual facts of observation.

Incidentally, 2 comparison may be applied to the numbers of species of each type
of distribution found in the different climatic zones of the island, whether the wet
zone, with the well distributed rain, or the dry, with its long dry season. In this way
we obtain the following figures :—
