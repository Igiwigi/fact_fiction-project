The former are generally greater than the latter, and the mean value of
the ratio is 1°8. In Diagram 3 these ratios are plotted against wave-length ; if the
relationship between the pressure and displacement were precisely linear, the dots
would group themselves about the line marked 1:0, but it is very obvious that the
readings at 10 atmospheres are too large for this relationship to hold. The diagram
also shows the curious fact that the departure from a linear relation is much more
pronounced for lines of small wave-length. For large wave-lengths the ratio is nearly
equal to unity. This is partly, but not entirely, due to the fact that the lines of great
wave-length have not been examined over the full range of pressures.
