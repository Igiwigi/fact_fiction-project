The fact which these experiments are here brought to prove,
has likewise been confirmed by other experiments, made with
other instruments, and at times when the temperature of the air
has been as high as 64*; but I will not take up the time of the
Society, by giving a particular account of them in this place. As it 8ometimes happened, though very seldom, in the course

of an experiment, (which commonly lasted several hours,) that
I was called away, and was not present to observe the thermo-
meter, at the moment of the passage of the mercury through one
or both of those points 'of its scale which formed the limits of
the given interval, chosen as the standard for a comparison of
the results of the experiments with each other, it became #
matter of considerable importance, to find means for supplying
these accidental defects, and ascertaining the points in question
by interpolation. In order to facilitate the means of doing this, I endeavoured
to investigate the law of the cooling of” hot bodies in a cold
fluid medium; and I found reason to conclude,

That if, on the right line AB, a perpendicular CD be taken,
equal to the difference of the temperatures of the hot body and
of the colder medium, expressed in degrees of the thermometer;
and, after a certam given time, represented by CE, taken on
the! line AB” at' the point E, another perpendicular EF be
erected, and EF be taken equal to the difference of the tempera-
tures after the-time represented by CE has elapsed; and if the

ference of' the temperatures after” the times' EG and GL have
elapsed,; a curved line PQ, drawn through the points D, F, H, M,
will be the logarithmic curve; or, if it vary from that curve, its
variation, within the limits answering to- a change of tempera-
ture/ amounting to-a few degrees, (especially if they be taken
when the temperature of the hot bady'is about 40 or zo degrees
above that of the medium,) will be 80. very s8mall, that no sen-
Sible error will result from a-supposition'that it is the logarithmic
curve, in supplying, by computation, any intermediate observa-
tions, which happen to have been neglected in making an
experiment.
