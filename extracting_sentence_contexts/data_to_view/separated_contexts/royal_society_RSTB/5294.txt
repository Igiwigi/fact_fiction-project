In the
channels between the coral islands and on the seaward side of the reefs would have
accumulated the débris formed as the product of their reduction by the waves. We
should expect the character of this débris to vary according to the distance from the
origin, the amount of pounding to which the waves had subjected it, the nature of the
prevailing currents and the amount of subsequent cementation. Messrs. Bhake and
Huptxston long ago realised these fundamental facts, which are in danger of being
overlooked by the more ardent of the modern zoning paleontologists. In 1877 these
authors wrote of the old quarry at Stanton St. John [6, p. 310], “ We see here the spot
where the corals did not grow, as at Headington we saw where they did.
