In this expression the parts depending on F, F, are separately negligible by
Hopson’s theorem, except for values of ¢ between a+, and for such values
J (t)—f (x) is small and F—F, is finite. The whole is therefore arbitrarily small and,
in fact, zero; thus if the one expansion is valid for f(a), so is the other,* provided
that f(«) is continuous at «.

21. Again, the error produced in one of the functions ¢, y, ®, ¥ by neglecting or
altering « is relatively of the order of \~**, and thus it follows that if F, F, are
functions of the present type (§19) the same except for a change in ¢ then
F(t, #, R)—F, (¢,7, R) is limited. Similarly, then, the expansibility of f(a) is not
affected by a change in the value of o in the fundamental integral equations (3) so
long as {| o|dx exists and f(a) is continuous at x.

22. In order that the more general expansion may hold at the limits 0, 1, some
further conditions are necessary. It does not seem worth while to discuss these in
detail, but they are satistied—
