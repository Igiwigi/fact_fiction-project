In mucous glands the evidence is against the 8ubstance stored by the cells being
actually the mucin found in the fluid secreted. It is probably a pre-produet closely
related to mucin. In the serous glands the facts known are not sufficient to be of much use for or
against.

When the sccretion produced by a gland contains nndissolved particles, these particles may be stored up
by the gland, thus fat globules are apparently stored up by the cells of the Harderian and Mammary glands. I do not overlook the fact that a glycerine extract of the fresh Mammalian gastrie mucons membrane
contains a good deal of pepsin, but I believe this to be due simply to the zymogen being more easily split
up in these glands than in others.
