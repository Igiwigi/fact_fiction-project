‘into consideration. In the first place it was decided that the capacity of the narrowest
tube containing the liquid under examination should not be greater than 30 cub.
‘centims., because larger quantities of sufficiently pure specimens of many of the
iquids which it was proposed to examine can not readily be obtained. Experiments
‘Daving proved that the minimum diameter of tube which allowed the passage of a
“Buflicient quantity of light was 0°6 centim., the length of the tube was therefore -
“Zxed at about 62 centims.
A Having regard to the unwieldiness and cost of a helix which would project beyond
the tube, it was decided to make the tube project beyond the helix.
© The internal radius of the helix was fixed by the dimensions of the jacket. sur-
Bounding the tube, and preliminary experiments showed that for the jacket to be
Bilicient the internal radius of the helix had to be at least 2°5 centims.
@ From the fact that in most liquids the rotation is much smaller than in carbon
Bisulphide, in order to obtain sufficiently accurate readings in the case of such liquids,
felt it desirable that our apparatus should be designed to give with carbon
Bisulphide a double rotation of at least 40°. For the electromotive force and
“aximum current at our disposal (90 volts and 5 amperes), and for « tube of infinite
@ngth, we calculated the number of turns of wire which would give the above
a and from considerations of the weight of the helix and the heating effect due
the passage of the current, we chose No. 18 8. W.G. wire as being the most suitable.
g Although for electrical reasons it is best to use a long thin helix, in our case the
iaximum length which could be employed was fixed by the following considerations.
Bince the rate of change of the difference of magnetic potential between two points
/ axis of a helix alters rapidly when one of them moves near the end of the
ix. it was essential that the ends of the column of liquid should be at such a
