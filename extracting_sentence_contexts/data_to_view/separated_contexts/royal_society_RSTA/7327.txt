Let C be the closure of K’. It follows by repeated application of

2theorem 9 that C is a complex on some algebraic grating G, say. We prove that C is in fact

othe closure of the set of all primitively irreducible points X of S' with | X | >e.

<< Let A, be any primitively irreducible point of S with | A, | >e. Then there is a lattice Ay

Swith d(A,) <A(S), having A, as a lattice point, such that the only points of Ay in S are of the

on

Ey replacing A, by a suitable sub-lattice of itself, if necessary, we can ensure that

ShA(S) <d(A,) <A(S). Then A, isa point of S and is a primitive point of Ay.
