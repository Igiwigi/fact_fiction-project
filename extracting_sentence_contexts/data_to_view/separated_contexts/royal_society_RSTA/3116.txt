relationship between specific assumptions and specific, significant geometrical facts. The fifth
problem, for instance, relates to the question of the foundations of geometry as it had evolved
over the last third of the nineteenth century along two parallel paths. On the one hand, there
was the age-old tradition of elementary synthetic geometry, where the question of foundations
more naturally arises in axiomatic terms.
