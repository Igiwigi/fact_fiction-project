This
equality is verified for each obseryation ; then for any azimuth (9) the intensity of the
light transmitted by the glass = in? 0. If the lights be of the same colour, the bounding
diameter disappears completely and the process is comparatively easy ; but if there be
any notable difference of tint, it is much less satisfactory. In such cases I found, as
FRAUNHOFER had done long since, that one must make this diameter as faint as possible
â€”a fact which implies that the two beams, whether equal in intensity or not, make
nearly the same impression on the eye. I must add that within the last few months my eyes have ceased to be fit for 8uch
delicate work, and that most of these comparisons have been made under my inspection
by my As8istant, Mr. CuarLEs Fas, and occasionally by Mr.
