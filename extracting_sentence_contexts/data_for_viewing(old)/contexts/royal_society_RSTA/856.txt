This subsection is concerned with a selection criterion o* =2djD7/(p?V) that determines a
combination between the dendrite tip diameter p and its tip velocity V. We obtain this
combination on the basis of dendritic growth theory developed in a similar paper in the present
theme issue [20]. The criterion for o* given below generalizes previously known criteria and
comprises the hyperbolic mass transfer mechanism in a binary melt, growth kinetics and forced
convection. The main idea of how to derive this criterion consists in developing the laws
for formal transition between the hyperbolic and parabolic equations that describe the solute
concentration in the liquid phase.

Let us initially emphasize an important feature of hyperbolic integrals (4.6) and (4.7)
characterizing the steady-state dendritic growth at high solidification velocities V (at high growth
Péclet numbers Pry). This feature resides in the fact that the integrals (4.6) and (4.7) (for the
transport described by the hyperbolic equation) transform into equations (4.4) and (4.5) (which
are true for the transport described by the parabolic equation) after introducing new spatial
coordinates (subscript ‘new’) of the form

x1 =V1—Wxinew, X= V1—Wanew =pVin, 2=V1—Winew=F(n—§) (4.9)

(and y1 = V1 — W?y1new, ¥ = V1 — W?ynew in the three-dimensional geometry). Indeed, keeping
in mind that ¢(x) — ¢(x1) = (x? — x?)/2 (and ¢(x) — ¢(x1) = (x? — x?)/2 + (yj — y°)/2 in the three-
dimensional case), and ky =k, becomes kg, one can conclude that expressions (4.6) and (4.7)
become identical to expressions (4.4) and (4.5). Expressions (4.9), in turn, imply that the hyperbolic
problem transforms into the parabolic one after substitution p//1— W? = p/(1 — Pet.) by pnew
in coordinates Xnew, Ynew and Znew. It is important to highlight here that the selection parameter
