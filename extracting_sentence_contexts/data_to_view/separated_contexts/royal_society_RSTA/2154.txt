is
small considering the number and nature of the experimental determinations involved. Apart from a quantum theory, the range of possible values is so enormous in com-
parison with the variation observed that the emission of one quantum of characteristic
X-radiation for each electron in the associated corpuscular radiation must be regarded
as an experimentally established fact. It is a fact of some significance. Less accurate experiments on other substances lead to a similar conclusion approxi-
mately if not accurately. There is no, reason to think the results would be less
convincing.
