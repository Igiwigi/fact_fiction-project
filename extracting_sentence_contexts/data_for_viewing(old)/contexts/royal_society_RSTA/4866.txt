4. A complexity theory for self-assembly: comparing models of self-assembly

What about other models of self-assembly besides the abstract Tile Assembly Model?

(a) Two-hands

It has been shown that the two-handed, or hierarchical, model of self-assembly (where large
assemblies of tiles may come together in a single step) is not intrinsically universal [27].
Specifically there is no tile set that, in the two-handed model, can simulate all two-handed systems
for all temperatures. However, the same paper shows that for each temperature t â‚¬ {2,3,4,...}
there is a tile set U, that is intrinsically universal for the class of two-handed systems that work
at temperature t. Also, there is an infinite hierarchy of classes of such systems with each level
strictly more powerful (can assemble more complicated shapes) than the one below. In fact there
are an infinite set of such hierarchies, as described in the caption of figure 2. These results give a
formalization of the intuition that multiple long range interactions are more powerful than fewer
long range interactions in the two-handed model.

By combining results from [25,46], we get that there is a tile set for the two-handed model
that (at temperature 2) simulates any tile assembly system T of the abstract Tile Assembly
Model. Specifically, T is simulated using the intrinsically universal tile set U from [46] (which

5Moreover, Becker & Meunier [49] show that mismatch-free systems and systems without excess binding strength cannot
simulate each other.
