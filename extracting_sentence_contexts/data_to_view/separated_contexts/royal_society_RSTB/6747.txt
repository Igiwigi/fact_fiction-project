Larsen was apparently unaware of Kuno’s work. (ii) Microscopic characters. The optical determination of tridymite and cristobalite
in the rocks of Montserrat presented great difficulties, owing to the fact that diagnostic
data concerning these minerals, as given in various papers and standard mineralogical
text-books, are either incomplete, ambiguous or contradictory. Kuno’s paper is an
exception, and his descriptions of tridymite, and his drawings and photographs of
cristobalite, are extremely useful. Kuno’s determination of cristobalite was confirmed
by Kazumoto by means of an X-ray powder photograph.
