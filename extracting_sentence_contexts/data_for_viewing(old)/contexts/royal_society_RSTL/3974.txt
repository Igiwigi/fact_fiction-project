also in the teeth of these organs in Notommata aurita.

85, The mallei, at first sight, seem wholly wanting in Asplanchna; but they are
really present, though in a state of extreme attenuation and degeneration, Mr. Dat-
RYMPLE thought he saw an occasional glimpse of an accessory curved point, outside
the tip of each jaw, in 4. Brightwellii; and I bave invariably observed the same in
both that, species and A. priodonta (figs. 58, 59). It is a curved pointed rod, which,
at its lower end, that ordinarily would be free, is attached to a process, which is
itself attached, I believe, by a transverse ligament, to the ramus, near its articulation.
It is most eyanescent ; yet it is not dissolved by treatment with potash, and I have
no doubt that it represents the malleus.

86. The fulcrum, though short and thin, is very deep; the depth in fact exceeding
the length (fig. 59); and it affords a clear insight into the nature of the articulation
of the ramiâ€”a ginglymus of the simplest kind ; the articulating parts having Straight
parallel edges, united by an interposed membrane.

87. Another peculiarity in this genus is the absence of the mastaz;. at least in its
