Q explained should in the first instance be clearly and fully comprehended ; and that
© for this purpose, the different classes of facts, which undergo much additional com-
2 plication by being viewed together, should be distinguished apart, and that each
S class should be presented separately, combining at the same time, as far as circum-
S stances may permit, facts of the same class obtained from different parts of the
[= globe.
& Under this impression I have deemed that an acceptable service might be rendered,
Z by arranging in a small compass and presenting together the Annual Variations which
= the Magnetic Declination undergoes at every hour of the day at the four Colonial
= Observatories established by the British Government at Toronto, Hobarton, the Cape
-2 of Good Hope and St. Helena ;—<stations selected, it may be remembered, with the
a express view (amongst others) of affording, as far as any four stations of equally con-
> venient access might be expected to do, the means of generalizing the facts of the
= Annual and Diurnal Variations in different quarters of the globe. I have attempted to
& accomplish this object by a graphical representation (Plate XXVI.), in which the
E Annual Variation at every hour is shown by vertical lines varying in length according
£ to the amount of the range of the Annual Variation at each hour; each line having
SZ also small cross lines marking the mean positions of the several months in the annual
s range. The scale is the same for all the stations, being one inch to one minute of
S declination. The declination is that of the north end of the magnet at all the sta-
= tions; the upper end of the line is always the eastern extremity, and the lower end
the western extremity, of the annual range. The broken horizontal line which erosses
all the verticals at each station, marks for each of the observation hours the mean
declination in the year at that particular hour, obtained by adding together the
daily observations of the declination at that hour, and dividing the sum by the
