Sex differences in behaviour are ubiquitous among sexually reproducing animals.
Many of these sex differences can be ultimately related to sex roles, defined as
differences between males and females in the intensity of reproductive compe-
tition with members of the same sex, in how choosy they are in selecting mates
and in the nature and extent of parental care they exhibit [2]. A frequently
observed pattern across vertebrates, characterized by caring females and compet-
ing males, has been referred to as ‘conventional’ sex roles. These widespread sex
differences in behaviour have ultimately been traced back to differences in gamete
size, i.e. anisogamy [3,4], but exactly how anisogamy shapes sex roles has recently
been questioned [5]. However, denying any effects of anisogamy for sex roles, and
attributing all observed variability among species to chance and idiosyncratic,
environment-driven factors [6,7] or doubting the existence of sex roles altogether
[8-10], are positions that cannot be easily reconciled with the fact that sexually
