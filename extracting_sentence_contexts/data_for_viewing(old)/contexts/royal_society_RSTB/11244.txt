Studies linking personality and leadership have, however,
focused predominantly on one position—the front—effec-
tively categorizing all individuals in the group according to
a single dichotomy: leader versus followers. That is, an indi-
vidual who first departs when the group moves categorized
as a leader, while all others who come after are categorized
as followers [19,23,24]. This is partially because collective
movements are frequently depicted as originating from one
individual (the leader, or decision-maker) initiating move-
ment. We argue that this is an oversimplification that limits
our understanding of the potentially delicate interaction
between personality and leadership. That leadership can, in
fact, be distributed among several group members during
collective movement has been demonstrated in various taxa
(see [25] for a review). The extent to which individual person-
ality traits influence ranks in such more complex, distributed
leadership networks remains to be elucidated.

In this study, we used flocks of homing pigeons, Columba
livia, to investigate the relationship between personality and
influence on collective movement. Pigeons spontaneously
engage in group flights around their home loft as well as
during homing from distant sites, where conflicts over
route choice may arise due to inter-individual differences in
route preferences [26]. Past research has identified determi-
