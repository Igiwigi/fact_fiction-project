S abolition of common sensibility as well as of true 8mell from the right nostril. The
Zlacrymation was the indication of the reflex excitation of the lacrymal gland through
> the medium of tactile sensibility, which till continued unimpaired on the left side.
Z The absence of motor reaction, however, was an interesting fact, and serves to show how
£2 much of the reaction caused by a pungent vapour applied to the nostril is dependent
HZ on the integrity of true olfactory sensibility.
E As regards taste, the results indicated its entire abolition. But not only taste, as
E 8uch, but also the tactile sensibility of the tongue seemed to have been destroyed.
= This was noted as a remarkable phenomenon, and the tests were frequently repeated in
SZ order that no fallacy might be allowed to remain. Not only on the right side of the
< tongue, but also on the left, was this absence of reaction noted. The centres for the
Z tactile sensibility of the tongue on the left side seemed to have been destroyed along
Q with those of special sense, a fact apparently indicating their close anatomical relation
in the hemisphere. The following experiments serve to narrow the boundaries of the
lesions causing these various results as regards hearing and tactile sensation.

Experiment XV.

April Tth, 1875. —The $ubject of this experiment was the same monkey used for
Exp. IX.

After the animal had quite recovered from the effect of destruction of the angular
gyrus on the left side, it was again chloroformed, and the superior temporo-sphenoidal
