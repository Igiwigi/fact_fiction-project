coupling functions are the same as in figure 3. (Online version in colour.)

in the awake state. The strong coupling function between respiration and the heart oscillations
(figure 4u—x) is the only one to have been studied previously, and our results confirm the earlier
work [19-21]. More importantly, the propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia made the form of the
cardiorespiratory coupling function more time-varying and unstable—which is opposite to the
effect of anaesthesia on the delta—alpha coupling (cf. figure 4a—d).

(b) Effect of anaesthesia on the coupling strength

In order to assess the influence of anaesthesia, we first quantify the coupling (amplitude) strength.
The latter has been extensively studied in earlier work [13,15,45,51]: wherever reference was made
to coupling causality and directionality, it was in fact the net coupling strength, or a measure
proportional to it, that was being evaluated. Our coupling decomposition enables us to go beyond
this by quantifying the coupling strengths of the individual components of the net coupling.

In figure 5, we summarize the changes of coupling strength induced by anaesthesia. The
different effect on the separate coupling components is evident in the delta—alpha relationships
shown in the top row of figure 5a—c. The net coupling with sevoflurane is significantly different
from the awake and propofol states (figure 5a); for direct coupling all the states are different
(figure 5b), while the indirect coupling for propofol was significantly the smallest (figure 5c).
Note also that direct coupling is the dominant component of the net coupling. For the theta—
gamma interaction, it is only the indirect coupling that differs between the awake and sevoflurane
states (figure 5f). Anaesthesia increased significantly the net and indirect coupling strengths in
alpha-gamma (figure 5¢-i). This coupling is mostly defined by the indirect coupling component.
