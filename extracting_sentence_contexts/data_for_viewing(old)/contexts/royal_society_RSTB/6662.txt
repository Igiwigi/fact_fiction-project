292 D. GC. LLOYD ON THE CHOICE OF HOSTS AND

might have remained did not influence the distribution of the females’ eggs, for the
latter actually preferred hosts containing live parasites to hosts containing dead
parasites. If water-soluble chemical substances had been present they should have
been eliminated by immersion in hot water. Moreover, it cannot be said that other
characters of the host type, such as movements of the parasite larvae, outweighed any
significance attaching to a possible external odour, for hosts containing a dead parasite
were avoided to an extent equal to those containing live parasites. This is the second
point emerging from this experiment—the fact that movements of the contained
parasite here play a minor part in helping the female to determine the precise nature
of the host. One cannot presume this to be general for the entire development of the
parasite, as only the limited movements of early larvae are involved here. Thirdly,
the experiment raises the problem of the suitability of the hosts chosen by the females
for the development of their progeny. It is evident that, even allowing for the appreci-
able mortality during parasite development because of desiccation of the gipsy moth
larvae occurring in hosts which have been immersed twice in hot water, the choice of
hosts containing a live parasite rather than hosts containing a dead parasite is an
unsuitable one; for with the gipsy moth egg only one Ovencyrtus can develop to maturity
and the older parasite inhabitant is almost invariably the survivor. This question may
be more conveniently considered in conjunction with other data and will be discussed
later in the paper.
