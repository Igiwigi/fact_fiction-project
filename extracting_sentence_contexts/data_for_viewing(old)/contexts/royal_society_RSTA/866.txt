2. Quantum non-locality: some achievements and three outstanding open
questions

The initial question was: Can it really be that Nature requires non-local variables, like, for
example, the quantum state vector ¥? Schrédinger [5] and Einstein, Podolsky & Rosen [6]
expressed this question very clearly already in 1935, and Freedman & Clauser [7] and Aspect
et al. [8] gave the first (and already quite convincing) experimental answers. But physics being an
experimental science, a so-called loophole-free experiment was required. Today, we have four
such experiments [9-12]. Some other clever experiments challenged the possibility that some
superluminal influences could explain away the non-local quantum correlations [13-16]. Such
superluminal influences could even be excluded theoretically under the assumption that one
cannot signal faster than light at the macroscopic level [17]. Hence, today, quantum non-locality is
a fact: Nature is able to produce random events that can manifest themselves at several locations,
as we like to phrase it. Another (provocative?) sentence is: Quantum non-local correlations
emerge, somehow, from outside space-time in the sense that no story in space-time can tell how
they happen [13,17,18]. That is enough for conceptual physics; let us look at the other aspects of
non-locality.!

Non-locality contributed also to mathematical physics, with the geometrical representation of
local correlations by polytopes whose facets represent the Bell inequalities [19,20]. Theoretical
questions about the number of bits that need to be communicated in order to simulate quantum
correlations were asked and partly answered [21-24]. But, possibly surprisingly, the most
remarkable breakthrough came from applied physics when it was noted that non-locality, i.e. the

We cannot resist asking some more provocative questions: How does an event know that it is non-locality correlated to
