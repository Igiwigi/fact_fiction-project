These findings of a fundamental constructive role for information offer a new perspective
on the existence of information in biology. There is a school of thought, going back to Hubert
Yockey’s work on information theory in biology in the 1950s [18], that ‘mere’ chemistry is not
an informational process and cannot therefore offer a self-contained account of the origin of


life. There is a whiff of vitalism here, but that is not to denigrate the idea—rather, it serves to
highlight the profound difficulty of understanding how the property of information encoding
could have arisen from scratch in the prebiotic world. Of course, we can design molecules as
information carriers, transmitters and processors, but the very mention of design emphasizes
how such things are put in by hand. That idea is linguistically implicit in Barbieri’s assertion in
this theme issue that living matter is distinct from non-living by virtue of being ‘manufactured’
matter [19]. This point of view—specifically, the fact that living systems make observable things
with distinct structures and functions, and do so via a system of coding—leads Barbieri to propose
that it is not enough to propose that life is ‘chemistry plus information’—we must include ‘plus
codes’ too.

Wills, meanwhile, argues that spontaneous symmetry-breaking transitions are the missing
ingredient that allowed a prebiotic system of information coding to emerge [20]. Regardless of
whether this can be securely demonstrated (like all origin-of-life ideas, it remains frustratingly : =
hard to test), it has the distinct virtue of encouraging us to cease imagining (if we ever did) 3
that life consists of islands of order surrounded by chaos. The more we know about complex,
non-equilibrium systems of all kinds, the more we seem forced to conclude that ordering and nee)
organization are a kind of fundamental impulse in matter—not in any mystical sense but as :
an emergent outcome of the kind of long-ranged correlations that interactions between many a]
