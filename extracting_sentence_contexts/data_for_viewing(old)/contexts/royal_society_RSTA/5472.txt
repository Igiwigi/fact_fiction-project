conditions, such as mercury, rubidium and caesium, become non-metallic when
they are expanded to low densities. These studies probe the supercritical states
of the various elements where the density can be continuously varied, allowing
one to investigate the density at which each ‘metallic’ element actually becomes
a metal—or, indeed, the situation when nominally non-metallic elements such
as hydrogen and oxygen (designated as such from our room temperature, room
pressure experience) transform to the metallic state. As well as the tremendous
technical difficulties associated with experiments on these high-temperature
systems, one is also forced to confront the basic conceptual problem. Namely, in
systems at temperatures far above absolute zero, how can we distinguish between
a metal and a non-metal? And, are the different density-dependent behaviours
understandable in ‘simple’ models for the metal-non-metal transition, especially
in light of the high temperatures and of course recognizing the fact that these
are disordered liquids and vapours?

In figure 7, we highlight the evolution of the density-induced non-metal
to metal transition for the high-temperature fluids of the chemical elements
hydrogen, oxygen, rubidium, caesium and mercury. The conductivity data as
