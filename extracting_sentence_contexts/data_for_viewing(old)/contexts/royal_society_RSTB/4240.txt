the course of the nerve and in older stages surrounds the hinder and outer side of the
mandibular division of the fifth nerve.

Comparison of this account with that of Ornithorhynchus given above will show
that the two processes in the sphenoparietal membrane in the one type are strictly
homologous with the one in the other, the lower process in Echidna being generally
homologous with the small process which in Ornithorhynchus invariably bounds the
back of the mandibular division of the trigeminus.

The difference between the two forms depends very largely on the fact that in
Echidna there is a distinction between the limbus precapsularis, from which the upper
process starts, and the commissura prefacialis which gives origin to the lower process,
whilst in Ornithorhynchus the front border of the otic capsule is one uniform curve.

I have shown above that in Ornithorhynchus in the only stage at my disposal there
are only two ossifications in the otic capsule.

The first of these surrounds the fenestra cochlee and extends forward under
the cochlea and backwards below that posterior part of the vestibule which goes to
