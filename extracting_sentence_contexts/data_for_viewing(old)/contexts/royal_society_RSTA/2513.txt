for AR filament channels, the crucial agent in the formation of larger, quiet-Sun filaments is solar
differential rotation. At a later stage, magnetic flux cancellation along the PIL could be observed:
in this process, opposite magnetic polarities converge, collide and disappear (e.g. [40-42]). This
process may also enhance complexity along the PILs, as discussed in ยง4 below. Note that flux
emergence, shearing motions and flux cancellation may occur independently or in tandem in
ARs that host major eruptive events.

b) Coronal properties

Models of CME initiation (see ยง5) presume that the pre-eruptive coronal configuration is either a
magnetic flux rope or a sheared magnetic arcade. In the latter case, the sheared arcade transitions
to a flux rope during the eruption because there is no physical process that can produce a
large-scale outward propagation without involving a flux rope. Motivated by this fact, a large
number of works investigate the pre-eruptive coronal configurations using multi-wavelength
observations. In principle, both sheared arcades and flux ropes can sustain dipped, sheared
filament channels above PILs. However, deciphering the pre-eruptive coronal structure is difficult
because routine magnetic field measurements above the photosphere are not available and
because line-of-sight confusion is inevitable when imaging optically thin plasmas. This said, there
are direct efforts that have aimed to constrain the properties of the coronal magnetic field by using


radio observations (e.g. see [43] for a review). Indirect ones often exploit the properties of filament
barbs [44] or tornadoes [45].
