If implicit reliance could be placed on these analyses of the salts of lead, obtained
directly and by the aid of ammonia, we should conclude that, by the action of oxide
of lead, the resin of benzoin was separated into two resins represented respectively
by C,, H,, Og, and C,, Hy O,,. I am unwilling, however, myself to place implicit
reliance upon them, knowing now how easily the resin undergoes decomposition by
slight eleyations of temperature; a fact of which I was not 80 well aware when these

analyses were made*. The entire subject of the action of alkalies and oxides on this
resin is deserving of a complete revision, which it is my intention hereafter to under-
take. The course and method of research, and the precautions to be adopted are
clearly marked out by the experiments above-described, and I only leave the subject
in its present incomplete state, because having made already nearly fifty analyses of
this resin and its products, I may be permitted to turn my attention for a short time
to some of the other members of this interesting natural family, on the constitution
of which the above researches, though incomplete, tend to throw much light.
