properties of cell-walls.

The examination of the mode of failure in timber, which has led to the work
described in this paper, was begun at the request of Lt.-Col. Jenkin, R.A.F. Iam
deeply indebted to him for the original suggestion of this line of work and for his
continued interest during its course. I have derived great advantage throughout
the work by discussing various engineering questions, as they have arisen, with
Major Rogerson, R.A.F., and I desire to thank him for many helpful suggestions.
I am further indebted to him for the supply of many fractured specimens of wood.
The research has been carried out, in the course of more definitely applied work for
the Air Ministry, in the Barker Cryptogamie Research Laboratory of the University
of Manchester. [ have to thank Prof. W. H. Lana, F.R.S., for encouraging me to
attempt to relate the facts of the mechanical properties of wood to fundamental
botanical questions bearing on the structure of cell-walls in plants.

The mechanical properties of a wood may depend on the microscopic or ultra-
microscopic structure of the substance of the walls of the cells comprising it, on the
form of these cellular elements, and also on their gross anatomical arrangement.

* Tt is recognised that a long thin column of wood may undergo mechanical failure by elastic
instability, but since the deformation in such cases occurs within the limits of elasticity and is not
permanent, the failure is accompanied by no permanent microscopical changes in the cell-walls of the
wood. In this paper it is the changes accompanying failure by permanent deformation which are being
considered,
