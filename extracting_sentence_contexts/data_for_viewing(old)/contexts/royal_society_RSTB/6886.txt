distinguished by Darlington (1935), who gave them the names of “‘super-spiral’’ and “relic spiral”
respectively. These names will not be used here from the general desire to simplify terminology.
“Super-spiral’’, for the zigzag seen in Osmunda is also of doubtful validity. “Super”, in the sense of
“additional” it certainly is, but whether it is a ‘‘spiral” and not merely a fortuitous bending is not
evident.

t In justice to this writer it should be pointed out that his own description of telophase behaviour
in Fritillaria (Darlington 1935) does not exactly accord with his general statement (1937) quoted above.
He is careful to explain in the former (/oc. cit. p. 47) that expansion (or “relaxation” to use his own word)
does not necessarily mean untwisting. It is also perfectly possible that different species may differ in
the precise point at which uncoiling begins, though evidence for this is lacking. The essential point that
telophase involves something other than and additional to such coiling or uncoiling as may occur seems
however, clear from the facts for Osmunda.

{ These results are in general agreement with those of Sax and Sax (1935) in Tradescantia and with
the expressions of opinion by several other writers.
