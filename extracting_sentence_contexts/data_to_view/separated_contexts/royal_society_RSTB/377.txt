3, B, the upper aperture being slipped over the head
of the larva, which was then assisted through the lower aperture by the use of
forceps ; a little glue had been placed on the upper surface of the upper disc, and this
was pressed tightly with a slight screwing motion on to the glass, from which the
larva was hanging, and in all cases tightly adhered. The larva nearly always
remained quiet in the tube, and did not retract its head into the upper compartment. Fearing lest the larva might stretch its head beyond the lower rim of the tube, the
external surface, as far as it could be seen from such a point of view, was always of
the same colour as the lower compartment, but I do not think that the larvee ever
stretched so far ; in fact, the tubes were of such a length that it would have been very
difficult for them to doso, All the dimensions were adopted after careful measurement
of larvee in Stage III. The upper compartment was illuminated through the upper
aperture, and the lower by the open end of the tube, and also partially through the

blocked by the larval bristles.
