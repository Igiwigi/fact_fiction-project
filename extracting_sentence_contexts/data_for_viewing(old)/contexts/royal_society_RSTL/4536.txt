ment 1 only 13:2 parts out of 100 of the chloride are reduced. And here the ratio
9: 2 occupies the place of the ratio 4: 1 or 8:2 on the other series. But the limiting
ratio of 7 :2 is in both series the same, and on the whole a certain increase of loss,
although not, a gradual increase, is to be observed with the increase of the chloride
taken. These experiments confirm the fact, that under similar cireumstances the
different preparations of the peroxide have a different reducing power.

Experiments with Chloride of Silver at the temperature of the air.

The next experiments were made also with the chloride of silver, but at a lower tem-
perature, the temperature of the air. I had already found how very much at this low
temperature the temperature might be varied without alteration of the action, and in
this case the experiments are arranged without any special reference to the variation
of the temperature. The peroxide in the first series was the same as that taken in the
last experiments, namely, the peroxide Q containing 8:58 per cent. of oxygen.
