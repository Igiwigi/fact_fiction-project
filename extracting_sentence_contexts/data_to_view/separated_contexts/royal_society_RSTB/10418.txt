of this research is based on the fact that in order to under-
stand animal distribution patterns in marine ecosystems,
and model the effects of environmental perturbations on
their survival, one has to understand the factors that control

their behaviour and interactions under normal conditions. If (c) Irradiance sensitivity experiments
