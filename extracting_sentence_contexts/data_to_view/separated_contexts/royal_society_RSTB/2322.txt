The curved
surfaces of equal pressure of the vapour overlying the disc form an orthogonal system
of ellipsoids, also having their foci in the edge of the disc, and since these ellipsoids
come closer together at the margin than they do nearer the middle of the liquid disc
(see fig. 1), Sreran concludes that evaporation proceeds more rapidly from the edge
than from the centre of the disc. i

It must be remembered that this was a purely mathematical deduction, which, as
far as we know, has never been experimentally verified in the form which Sreran
gave it. It is, however, in complete agreement with the reverse phenomena of
absorption by a circular surface, and with many other facts recorded in this paper. Sresnewsky (‘ Beibl.,’ 7, p. 888, 1883), in some observations on the evaporation
of liquid drops, showed that the amount of evaporation of such drops is probably
proportional to the circumference and not to the supertficies.

WINKELMANN (‘ Wied. Ann.,’ vol. 3 (1888), 401) attacked experimentally that
portion of the problem relating to the differential evaporation from different portions
of a circular free surface of liquid.
