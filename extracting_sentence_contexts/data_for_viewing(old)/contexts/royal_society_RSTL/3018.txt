degree of probability at least, the relative quantity of ore in veins, and the
directions in which it most abounds.

When the distance of the plates from each other in a horizontal direction
was only a few fathoms, and the copper ore between them was plentiful, and
uninterrupted by non-conducting substances, or the workings in the mine, no
action occurred, owing no doubt to the good conducting power of the vein ;
but where a cross vein of quartz or clay happened to be between the plates
under similar cireumstances, the action was usually great.

When the communication was established between two plates at different
depths on the same vein, or between different veins, whether at the same leyel
or otherwise, the electrical action was in general the most decisive. In fact,
veins which in some instances were almost destitute of ore, and did not affect
the needle per se, did 80, though perhaps only in a slight degree, when elec-
trical communications were made between them.

It will be seen that the direction of the positive electricity was in some cases
from east to west, and in others from west to east ; and when parallel veins
were compared, its general tendency was, I think, from north to south, though
in several instances it was the reverse. In veins having an underlie towards
