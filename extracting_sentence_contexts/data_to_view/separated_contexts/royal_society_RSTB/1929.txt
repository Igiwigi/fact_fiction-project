H. LANG ON APOGAMY AND THE DEVELOPMENT

This series may be considered to be a natural one, not in the sense that the steps
have been passed through to arrive at the condition of matters seen in Pteris cretica,
for instance, but as placing the different cases of apogamy in a relation to one another,
which admits of the corresponding parts being recognised. There is, in fact, a
difference between them, depending on the more or less immediate assumption of â€”
sporophytie characters by the new growth. From a slightly different point of view, a distinction can be drawn between two
forms of apogamy. These may be termed induced apogamy and direct apogamy.
