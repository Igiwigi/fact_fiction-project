It will be seen to give the general character of the distribution, but much more elaborate
experiments would be required before any statement could be made as to whether
frequency of tint guesses really does follow a curve with limited range of Type I.
On the same plate the frequency of 128 guesses distributed over 18 tints is given,
the approximation to a curve of Type I. is fairly close considering the paucity of
guesses.

(28.) Example VIII.—The question may be raised, how are we to discriminate be-
tween a true curve of skew type and a compound curve, supposing we have no reason
to suspect our statistics d priori of mixture. I have at present been unable to find any
general condition among the moments, which would be impossible for a skew curve
and possible for a compound, and so indicate compoundedness. I do not, however,
despair of one being found. It is a fact, possibly of some significance, that the best
fitting skew curve to several compound curves that I have tested is a curve of
Type L, and not that of Type IV. which appears to be the more usual type in
biological statistics, Taking, as an example, the statistics for the “foreheads” of Naples
crabs due to Professor WxELpon, and resolved into their components in my memoir,

‘Phil. Trans.’ A, vol. 185, p. 85, et seg., I find for the best fitting skew curve the
equation
