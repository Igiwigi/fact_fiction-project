Some general information can be deduced from these curves. At high velocities
(v/a = 2-0) and large values of 3 the couple coefficient actually falls below its low

The origins of all the curves except for type III. are displaced upwards and can be recovered from the
fact that all curves pass through their respective origins. The scale of 6 is in degrees.

has here a large curvature downwards. It is, on the other hand, almost straight in
the region of the velocity of sound.

We may notice also the peculiar behaviour of rounds ITI. (11-18), fig. 3,* in which
the motion seems to become quite irregular from round to round after the first
maximum yaw is attained. As these are the only rounds in which a yaw of 35 degrees
or more is developed, it seems likely that some peculiar change in the type of the
