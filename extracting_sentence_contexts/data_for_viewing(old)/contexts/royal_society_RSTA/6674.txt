it seems probable that its variation would be according to some law of the same kind.
Thus, if the spectroscope enables us to form an idea of the temperature in various
parts of a nebula, we shall at the same time obtain some idea of the distribution of
density.

It has been assumed that the outer portion of the swarm is in convective
equilibrium, and therefore there is a definite limit beyond which it cannot extend.
Now, a medium can only be said to be in convective equilibrium when it obeys the
laws of gases, and the applicability of those laws depends on the frequency of collisions.
But at the boundary of the adiabatic layer the velocity of agitation vanishes, and
collisions become infinitely rare. These two propositions are mutually destructive of
one another, and it is impossible to push the conception of convective equilibrium to
its logical conclusion. There must, in fact, be some degree of rarity of density, and of
collisions, at which the statistical treatment of the medium breaks down.

T have sought to obtain some representation of the state of things by supposing
that collisions never occur beyond a certain distance from the centre of the swarm.
Then, from every point of the surface of the sphere, which limits the regions of
collisions, a fountain of meteorites is shot out, in all azimuths and inclinations to the
vertical, and with velocities grouped about a mean according to the law of error.
These meteorites ascend to various heights without collision, and, in falling back on to
the limiting sphere, cannonade its surface, so as to counterbalance the hydrostatic
pressure at the limiting sphere.

The distribution of meteorites, thus shot out, is investigated in $13, and it is
