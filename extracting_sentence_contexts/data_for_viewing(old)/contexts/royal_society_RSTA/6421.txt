explains, in effect, why the world is the order production business?

(iii) Order from disorder or macro from micro and the need for a physical selection principle

The first step towards the answer is to understand that spontaneous ordering (the production
of ACK states), as a micro (disordered) to macro (ordered) transformation, is a process of selection
[20,21]. By definition, it is the selection of some much smaller number of accessible microstates M2
(the new ordered macro state) from some initially much larger set My. This can be equivalently
understood as the spontaneous production of constraints on the previously disordered or less
ordered microstates dramatically constraining their degrees of freedom in the production of the
ordered flow. In short, selection is entailed by autocatakinetics (spontaneous ordering) [20], viz. if the
latter has happened/is happening then a process of selection has/is taken(ing) place. But, clearly,
the fact that this selection is not between replicating entities (biological or ‘natural’ selection),
while at the same time observed in simple physical systems forces the insight that there must be
an overriding physical selection principle to account for it.

(iv) Autocatakinetic closure and the expansion of space-time

The second step towards the solution to the universal ordering problem is given by a more
detailed look at what happens structurally with the individuation, or entification and progressive
ordering of an ACK. The origin of such a system occurs following a symmetry-breaking event
when autocatakinetic closure takes place and a new kind of causality, the self-amplifying circular
closure of the constitutive relations that define the system as distinct literally comes into being
(figure 5, and figure 4 for the generalized constitutive flow schematic) [3,5].
