In proof of my statement that the thin outer layer upon Ophidian teeth is enamel,
the following facts may be advanced :—

Its refractive index is high, s0 that it resembles enamel and does not resemble
cementum. It is very brittle*, 80 that it is often entirely lost in grinding down a thin
section, and is invariably much cracked when it does remain 7 8i7u (se Plate 48. fig. 1).

The application of acids to the sections wholly removes it, whereas cementum is even
less affected by acids than is dentine.

But what is more conclusive than all is its development ; it is formed from the
elongated cells of a perfectly characteristic and unmistakable enamel-organ, to be
presently described—a fact which alone would put it beyond all doubt that enamel
is present on the teeth of Ophidia, and that therefore cementum is not.

So far as the general plan of formation of individual tooth-germs goes, the teeth
of Ophidia conform pretty closely with those of Mammalia or Sauria; but whilst the
essential points are adhered to, there is 80 much difference in matters of detail that at
first sight the sections of the tooth-deyeloping region of a lizard and of a snake are
strikingly dissimilar. And although it is no more than was to be expected from the
other characters of the animal, it may be interesting to note that, in respect of the
development of its teeth, the slowworm is essentially a lizard, and does not show the
smallest, tendency towards that arrangement of the snccessonal tooth-germs which is
80 eminently characteristic of the Ophidia.
