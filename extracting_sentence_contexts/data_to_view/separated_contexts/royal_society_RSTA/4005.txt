However, the magnitude of the magnetocaloric effect is almost insensitive
to the applied pressure. Samanta et al. [20] have studied similar MnNiSi-based compounds. They took advantage of the fact that the magnetovolume interplay can be strongly enhanced by
isostructurally alloying 46% of MnNiSi with 54% MnFeGe. In the resulting system, application of
a moderate pressure of about 2.5 kbar enables doubling of the isothermal magnetic field-induced
entropy change, owing to a huge volume change of 7% taking place at the magnetostructural
transition undergone by the compound close to room temperature. This effect of pressure on the magnetocaloric properties of the Heusler NiCoMnSb alloy has
been reported in [21].
