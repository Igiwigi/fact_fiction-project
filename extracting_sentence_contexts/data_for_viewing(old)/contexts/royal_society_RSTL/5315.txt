urine was observed to pass: changing, like it, from slaty-blue to light, and ultimately
to deep blue.

Whether the blue indigo of the urine is derived directly from white indigo, or

from s0me other snbstance, as urine-pigment, capable of being transformed into blue
indigo, it is not easy to determine. It is most likely, however, that the formation of
white indigo in all instances precedes that of blue, but it is uncertain whether the
white variety is voided with the urine, or whether it is formed from some substance
contained in that fluid subsequent to its elimination. The fact, however, that blue
indigo is in some cases immediately developed on the addition of hydrochloric acid
to recent urine, appears to show that white indigo is present in the urine when first
voided.

It is at all events certain that a very close relation exists between indigo, whether
colourless or coloured, and two animal products, namely hematin and urine-pigment;
and there is much reason for believing that in many of the present cases the indigo
was formed either from modified or altered hazmatin or urine-pigment, since some of
the analyses show that blue indigo was freely developed from the aqueous solution of
the brown extractive, which itself was found s0 nearly to resemble haematin in its
chemical manifestations. The close relation which exists between hematin and
indigo is shown by the following elementary analysis of these substances :â€”
