to the right on account of non-homogeneity, a non-homogeneity which is of two kinds,
intra-phase and inter-phase, and which causes increasing impedance as the transforma-
tion proceeds. OA, OK, and OL represent the limiting Hooxn’s law loads which
are necessary to initiate the transformation in each of the three phases. It seems
clear that OA and OK must be considered to be almost equal, if we are to explain the
forms of the various available load/extension curves, the observed Hookn’s law changes
in the X-ray photographs, fig. 19, Plate 8, and, in fact, the general experimental
conclusion that the first two phases, K, and K,, are very closely inter-related. In a
system such as that shown in fig. 8 we may fairly argue that K, will transform with
comparative ease, just as experiment shows, but that, as the strains of extension spread
down between the cells, internal damage will gradually increase and in such a manner
as to show more or less sharp discontinuities as the effective boundaries of the phases
are reached. These boundaries also mark roughly the limits of extension when the
fibre is dry and when it is wetted with cold water, but they are to all intents and purposes
eliminated by the action of caustic alkalis and of steam (see below). The raising of
the “shoulder,” shown in fig. 5, of the normal, restricted load/extension curve after
the fibre has been held stretched in water must be ascribed to the hydrolytic break-
down of the side-chain restrictions both between K, and K, and between (K, + K)
and K, but chiefly the latter, as is clear from a consideration of fig. 9, which shows
