trimethylamine when decomposed by heat. The second test is a physiological one: a
saline solution of choline, of choline hydrochloride, and of the residue obtained from

the alcoholic extract of the cerebro-spinal fluid, and blood of these patients, produce a

temporary fall of pressure when injected intravenously in animals. This fall is partly

cardiac in origin, and partly due to dilatation of peripheral blood-vessels; the

dilatation is due to the direct action of the alkaloid on the neuro-muscular mechanism

of the blood-vessels themselves, There are many substances which produce a fall of
arterial pressure, but choline is peculiar in the fact that after the administration of a

small dose of atropine subcutaneously, it no longer produces a fall but a rise of blood

pressure, or, at any rate, the fall is abolished.

In the investigation of the blood, as a rule, only a small amount of material has
been at our disposal, and in order to obtain satisfactory evidence of choline, it is
necessary to considerably concentrate the alcoholic extract. We have therefore been
obliged to limit ourselves almost exclusively to these two tests; the two tests,
however, appear to us to be, if positive, absolutely conclusive evidence of the presence
of choline. The iodine test which has been employed by some investigators is not a
