In very small (not quite transformed) young of P. marinus.

SB. The early embryo of P. planer;; and

E C. The larval form (or Ammocete) of P. fluviatilis, ready for transformation.*

EZ These stages give most of the facts we are looking for, but it will be a satisfaction

* Since this paper was read I have received figures of the early embryo of Callorhynchus from wy
son, Prof. T. J, Parker, who has 8ncceeded in finding an early stage of this important type on the
shores of New Zealand. 1 am now satisfied that the Chimwroids are not nearly related to the
Petromyzoids.
