It may be worth while to digress here for a moment to notice that the existence in
Dicynodon of a grooved basi- (or pre-) sphenoid clasping the ventral edge of the
ethmoid should warn us to be cautious in accepting such an interpretation as Broom*
offers of the bones of the cranial base in Diademodon.

Broom has maintained since 1902 that the mammalian vomer had its homologue in
the reptilian parasphenoid.

Gauprt has drawn attention to the fact that the vomer in Echidna has a double
origin, and that the same is true in the mouse also, and some other mammals; facts
which he maintains militate against Broom’s view. He might have further pointed
out that the vomer is a paired structure in the adult guinea-pig, a fact easy to verify
and already mentioned by Parker and Brerrany as long ago as 1877.

Now that we know that a median-grooved bone clasping the ethmoid is not
necessarily the vomer, is it not possible to regard Broom’s vomer’in Diademodon as
part of the cranial axis and his prevomers in the same animal as possible homologues
of the mammalian vomer ?{

The Parotie Processes and Occipital Plate.

No sutures are distinguishable in the occipital plate, and this appears to be a
common condition in skulls of Dicynodon, as well as of Ptychognathus and Gordonia.
