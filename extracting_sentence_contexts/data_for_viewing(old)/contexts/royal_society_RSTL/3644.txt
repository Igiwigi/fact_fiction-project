drupe-bearing Conifer, are in like manner $hed in profusion from the lofty trees
that produce them, and become imbedded in the swamps out of which the trees
grow ; and that the latter are often coyered with Ferns and Lycopodia in great pro-
fusion, the decay of all which produces a spongy bog, in consistence not unlike that
of the mass in which the Trigonocarpons are imbedded. Such comparisons cannot,
however, be carried far; for whereas these New Zealand bogs, and the clay upon
which they almost invariably rest, are everywhere traversed by woody roots of coni-
ferous trees, we find in the substance of the limestone nodules and in the underclay
of the coal no trace of these, but in the latter Sigillaria roots abundantly (viz. Stig-
maria ficoides). In our present state of knowledge (or rather ignorance) of the phy-
siognomy, as well as of the botanical characters of the vegetation of the coal epoch,
all references of detached organs are extremely rash, and in the present case we
cannot venture beyond alluding to the facts, that the flower and fruit of Sigillaria
are totally unknown, and that these and Trigonocarpon fruit and Noggerathia leaves
are very abundant throughout the coal formation. There is another curious point,
to which also we can only incidentally allude, which is, that Salisburia has several
embryos in each seed, which in germinating become as many young plants: these
often coalesce at a very early period, and the result is a compound tree, with one
main axis, but as many primary roots as there were embryos: though offering no
explanation of the phenomenon, it may be mentioned as a curious cireumstance,
that the base of every Sigillaria trunk is marked by a cruciform ridge, separating
the four primary divisions of the root, of which ridge no explanation has ever been
offered. |
With regard to the evidence of Conifer having existed during the carboniferous
period, we are far from considering that afforded by the wood abounding in discs as
