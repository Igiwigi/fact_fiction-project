Here the range must lie between 0 and 1,
It is not that other values are excessively improbable, they are by the conditions
of the problem absolutely impossible. Hence, it is clear that the curves obtained
by Professor Wrtpon and Mr. H. THompson in the case of shrimps, crabs, and
prawns, can only be approximately normal curves, even if it were possible for the
ratios to run from 0 to 1. But as a matter of fact, the possible range is very
much smaller. We may not be able to assert, @ priori, what it is, but for an
adult prawn to have a carapace 3 or yoyo of its body-length, or a man a leg
$ or 35 of his body-length, may be regarded as impossibilities ; they are abnor-
malities, which could hardly survive to the adult condition. Precisely the same
remarks apply to skull indices, and probably to the relative size of all sorts of
organs in the adult condition.
