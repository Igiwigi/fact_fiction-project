Before we enter into a discussion of this question, it appears
to me that we are authorised, by the experiments which have
been delivered in this Paper, to make certain conclusions, that
will entirely alter the form of our inquiry. Thus, from the 18th
experiment it appears, that 21 degrees of solar heat were given
in one minute to a thermometer, by rays which had no power
of illuminating objects, and which could not be rendered visible,
notwithstanding they were brought together in the focus of a
burning lens. The same has also. been” proved of terrestrial
heat, in the gth experiment ; where, in one minute, 39 degrees
of it were given to a thermometer, by rays totally invisible, even
when condensed by a concave mirror, Hence it is established,


on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 507

by incontrovertible facts, that there are rays of heat, both solar
and terrestrial, not endowed with a power of rendering objects
visible. It has also been proved, by the whole tenour of our prismatic
experiments, that this invisible heat is continued, from the be-
ginning of the least refrangible rays towards the most refran-
gible ones, in a series of uninterrupted gradation, from a gentle
beginning to a certain maximum ; and that it afterwards declines,
as uniformly, to a vanishing state. These phenomena have been
ascertained by an instrument, which, figuratively speaking, we
may call blind, and which, therefore, could give us no infor-
mation about light ; yet, by its faithful report, the thermometer,
which is the instrument alluded to, can leave no doubt about
the existence of the different degrees of heat in the prismatic
Spectrum.
