REYNOLDS ON CERTAIN DIMENSIONAL

given. The diffusion of one gas into another has been explained by Maxwrr ; but
what has not, so far as I know, been explained is, that there should resnlt a current
from the side of the denser to that of the lighter gas. Indeed, from the manner
in which these phenomena, have been for the most part described, it would appear
that the importance of this current has been overlooked ; for, owing to the fact that
a larger volume of the lighter gas passes, the phenomena are generally deseribed as
if the current were from the lighter to the denser gas. These phenomena of transpiration, like those already considered, may be shown to
follow directly from the theory. But as has been already mentioned in Art. 73, in
order to completely adapt the equations of transpiration to the case of two or more
gases, it would be necessary to commence by considering the case of two or more
systems of molecules having different molecular weights, after the manner adopted by
Maxwerir.* Such an adaptation of the equations is too long to be included in this
paper ; but it may be seen from the equations, as they bave already been deduced, that
these particular phenomena would, and in some cages do, follow.
