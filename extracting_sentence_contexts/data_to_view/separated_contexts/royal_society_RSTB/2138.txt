Entero-chlorophyll and Plant Chlorophyll. In calling the pigment obtainable
from the gastric gland of Invertebrates by the name entero-chlorophyll, I meant to
express the idea forced upon me by an examination of most of the then known pig-
ments of animals, and of many of those of vegetable origin, that this gastric gland
pigment was nearer to vegetable chlorophyll than to any other. I was, however,
quite aware of the fact that the spectrum of this substance was not quite identical
with that of unchanged vegetable chlorophyll, as any one can see who refers to my
papers. I now repeat that this entero-chlorophyll deserves its name, and my reasons
for doing so are given below. Before giving the results of spectro-photometric observations, I may here give the
results of an examination of the entero-chlorophyll of Aplysia punctata, and of
Cheetopterin, to which latter Professor Ray LAnKxEsteR has drawn renewed attention
of late.
