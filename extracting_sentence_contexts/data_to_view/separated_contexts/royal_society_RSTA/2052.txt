However, as seen in the subsequent discussion,
a weak invariant is subject to the final condition, not the initial condition. Although the first moment of the weak invariant satisfies equation (2.3), the higher moments
do not, in general. In fact, the variance (AJ)? = (J?) â€” Uy? monotonically increases as follows:

d(Aj)?

_ 1)2
ap = 2(PO), (2.4)

where J =0J (x, f)/@x. Because of its irreversible nature and the structure of the first-order time derivative, it is non-
trivial to develop the action principle for the Fokker-Planck equation. A quantum mechanical
analogue of this issue has been studied in [26,27].
