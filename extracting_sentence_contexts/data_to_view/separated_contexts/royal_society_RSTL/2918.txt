From this Table we deduce the following facts :—First that the expenditure which
takes place from the cutaneous surface of the insect and from its respiratory organs
is greater than its whole amount of fecal expenditure, is more regular and con-
tinued, and decreases in proportion to the length of time which the insect remains
fasting, but never entirely ceases. It is greatest while the insect is in motion and
least when it is lying entirely at rest. Thus in the observations on Sphinz Elpenor,
Lixx., which was fasting during nearly the whole of the period of observation, twenty-
two hours, the insect lost only *85 of a grain of fecal expenditure, but 2:45 of grains
by the respiratory and cutaneous surfaces, and of this expenditure, when the insect
was lying at rest, only 05 of a grain per hour, but when in violent motion the loss
amounted to *15 per hour.
