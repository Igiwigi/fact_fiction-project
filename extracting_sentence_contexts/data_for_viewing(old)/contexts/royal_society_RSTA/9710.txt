The first terms in equations (59) and (60) give the contribution to the intensity of
sky light due to the sun’s radiation which has been once scattered by the atmosphere.

If C is small and if the attenuation is due to scattering only, (¢ = C), the first
term of (60) gives for the scattered radiation coming from a direction ¢ the value

which agrees with the value obtained by Kervin.*
The first terms in (59) and (60) taken as they stand with C = ¢ take into account
the fact that both the incident and scattered radiations suffer attenuation : this effect

is considered in a formula obtained by Rayiereu.* The term y in C = c+y allows
for attenuation by absorption alone (7.¢., without scattering). The second terms in
(59) and (60) represent the contribution of self-illumination to the scattered radiation
coming from any particular direction. An evaluation of this effect has not, so far as
the writer is aware, been submitted to calculation although the importance of the
effect is realized both by Kervint and Rayereu,* and in an analogous problem by
