What deduction should be allowed for the effect of heat,

* Such an atmosphere would, in fact, be of greater density on account of the far
greater extent of the medium affected by the solar attraction, although of extreme
rarity ; but the addition derived from this source, may be disregarded in the present
estimate, without prejudice to the argument, which will not be found to turn upon
any minute difference.

It may be time to consider when we have learned the amount
of apparent refraction at some given distance; and we may
then begin to conjecture, whether heat can counteract the
increase of density that would occur in the approach of only
