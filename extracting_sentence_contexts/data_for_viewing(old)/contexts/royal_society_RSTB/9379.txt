longer move nor feel their bodies below the neck. One way to restore some indepen-
dence for these patients is to equip them with anthropomorphic robotic arms [1],
controlled by reading out signals from the motor areas of the brain. Indeed, the
areas of the brain that sent signals to the arms before injury are spared and intended
movements can be decoded from the neuronal activity in these motor areas ([2,3],
see [4] for a review). However, the functionality of these neuroprostheses will be
limited if they do not also provide for somatosensation. Indeed, in individuals
with intact arms and motor pathways, but without somatosensory feedback, move-
ments are slow, clumsy and effortful [5,6]. Furthermore, thought-controlled
neuroprostheses without somatosensory feedback are experienced by patients as
disembodied robots, despite the fact that they can control them by mere thought
(Jennifer Collinger 2015, personal communication), which will limit their adoption.
Finally, tetraplegic patients often yearn for the opportunity to touch loved ones, an
experience that motor neuroprostheses currently do not afford.

One way to restore somatosensation in tetraplegic patients is to electrically
stimulate neurons in the somatosensory parts of the brain (figure 1). Indeed, the
area of the brain that received sensory signals from the arm before injury—
namely primary somatosensory cortex (S1)—is also spared. In brief, S1 comprises
four different modules—Brodmann’s areas 3a, 3b, 1 and 2—each of which exhibits
