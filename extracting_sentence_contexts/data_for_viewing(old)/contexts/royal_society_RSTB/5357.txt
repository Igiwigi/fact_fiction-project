wood. South-west of Marcham the sands are practically unfossiliferous, until the
neighbourhoods of Bremhill and Seend are reached, where the sudden thickening of the
deposits indicates a fresh source or sources of supply, and transport by rivers from the
same land-mass.

With regard to the composition of the sands, Mr. Nuaverson states that samples
which he examined from the Lamb Inn Quarry, Kingston Bagpuize, contained essentially
the same assemblage as the Portland Sands [7bid., p.255]. The chief constituents were
kyanite, staurolite, tourmaline, rutile, zircon, garnet and sphene. In spite of the fact
that “ the sphene has a yellow colour and is markedly angular, contrasting sharply with
the rounded colourless grains from the Upper Kimeridge,” Mr. Neaverson concludes
that the source of the bulk of the two sands was in all probability the same. He considers
it likely, in fact, that the sands continued to be derived from the same source from the
Kellaways period to the Gault, when for the first time a marked change manifests itself
by the presence of large purple-red garnets, and that this source was a northerly one, in
part Scottish, “in spite of the great distance between the Scottish Highlands and
Buckinghamshire.”

Now, in view of how little is known of the Paleozoic rocks underlying the London Basin
and the North Sea, it seems unnecessary to seek the source in regions so distant as the
Scottish Highlands. To assert that a certain suite of minerals has been brought by
a river flowing from a certain land-mass does not, of course, involve the assumption that
these minerals were derived directly from the distintegration im situ on that land-mass of
the rocks of which they are characteristic. If the Lower Calcareous Grit sands were
derived from beds of Old Red Sandstone, Millstone Grit or Permo-l'rias in that direction,
