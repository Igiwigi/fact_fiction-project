the effect shown in the curyes. The beginning and end of the dot are at different
heights, and similarly the beginning and end of the dash are at different heights, making
altogether a very irregular curye, especially at the higher speeds.

This irregularity very seriously interfered with the distinctness of the received signals,
although the change of current could be followed throughout by watching the spot.
At a high speed the dot appeared as a mere pause followed by a fall, instead of a little
rise followed by an equal fall ; and if the dots and dashes had been irregularly combined,
it would haye been impossible to disentangle them, as received, by the eye. If a
receiving instrument had been used like the common Morse receiver, simply marking
the time during which the received current was above or below a given strength, the
8ignals would have failed to give any intelligible record even at a very low speed : this is
8hown by the fact that it is impossible to draw a horizontal line intersecting both the
curye of repeated dashes and that of repeated dots, even for the very lowest speeds
recorded in each Table.

Thus, long before the limit is reached at which signals cease to produce any change
at the receiving end, the interference of one signal with another causes 80 great a con-
fusion in the currents received as to put a fresh limit to the practicable speed of trans-
mission.

This confusion is still further increased by the effect of a pause in the signals between
letters, words, or sentences.

During all intervals the cable is left in connexion with the earth at A; and if the
