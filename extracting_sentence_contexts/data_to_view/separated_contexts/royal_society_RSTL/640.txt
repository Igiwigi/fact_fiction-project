By diminishing the diameter of the air canals, their power
of passing the explosion is 80 much diminished that their depth
and circumference may be brought extremely low. I found
that flame would not pass through a canal of the ; of an
inch in diameter, when it was & of an inch deep, and forming
a cylinder of only Z of an inch in circumference; and a num-
ber of apertures of +; of an inch are safe when their depth
is equal to their diameter. It is evident from these facts,
that metallic doors, or joinings in lamps, may be easily made
8afe by causing them to project upon and fit closely to paral-
lel metallic surfaces. MDCCCXVI, : D

Longitudinal air canals of metal may, I find, be employed
with the same security as circular canals ; and a few pieces
of tin-plate soldered together with wires to regulate the dia-
meter of the canal, answer the purpose of the feeder or safe
chimney, as well as drawn cylinders of brass. A candle will burn in a lantern or glass tube made safe with
metallic gauze, as well as in the open air; I conceive, how-
ever, that oil lamps, in which the wick will always stand at
the same height, will be preferred.
