In the dental surface of this bone, as een in a transverse
vertical section, we observe a curious arrangement of the Haversian canals. Imme-
diately beneath the base of each tooth, there exists a group of small anastomosing
canals, scarcely distinguishable from those seen in the contiguous portion of the tooth
itself, and into which they open. Bearing in mind the intra-membranous origin of
this portion of the bone, the aboye fact has a significant bearing upon the origin of the
teeth. The central laminz of the premaxillary contain a remarkable series of very
minute parallel canals or tubes, which pass obliquely through them. The presphenoid and vomer exhibit a peculiarity of stracture, which at first sight
appears to distinguish them from the other bones which I have examined ; but this
difference is more apparent than real.
