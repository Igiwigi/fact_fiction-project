384. MAJOR P. A. MACMAHON ON THE THEORY OF PARTITIONS OF NUMBERS.

further, the fact that the expression does give the enumeration when 7 = 1, for then
the generating function is easily ascertainable to be

Lat 80% + 80 + de! + 80° + 3a! + a? + at,
which may be exhibited in the forms

(4)* (6) __ (3) (4?) __ (2) GEG)

Art. 100. The second of these forms immediately arrests the attention, for, 7
plano, it denotes the number of partitions on a lattice of four points (in fact, a
square), the part-magnitude being limited not to exceed 2. The reason of this is as
follows :—

Taking the cube with any distribution of units at the summits, we may project
the summits upon the plane of yz, adding up the units on the cube edges at right

angles to that plane, and thus obtain a distribution, on the points of the cube face in
that plane, of numbers limited in magnitude to 2.

This projection establishes the theorem, which may now be generalized. Conceive
