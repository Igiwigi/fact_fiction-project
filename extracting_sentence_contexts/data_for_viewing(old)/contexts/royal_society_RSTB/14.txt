superior frontal sulcus, and we trust that the above evidence will be accepted as
tending to establish this position.

The Intra-parietal Sulcus—There is one variation in the form of this suleus which
we will notice, not merely because, so far as we know, it has not been described before,
but also because it alters slightly the localisation of certain movements of the digits.
This variation simply consists in a bending horizontally forwards of the lower end of
the sulcus towards the fissure of Rotanpo, from which, in extreme cases, it is some-
times separated by only 3 mm. of surface of grey matter. This is particularly marked
in the pig-tailed Monkey (Macacus nemestrinus). We shall refer to this point
further.

Ascending Parietal Convolution—We would draw attention to the fact that the
upper end of this convolution—in other words, that part which represents in Man thé
parietal lobule—is invariably subdivided vertically by a subordinate suleus, which is
situated at the junction of the anterior and middle thirds of the convolution and runs
down parallel to the fissure of Rotanpo. The lower end of this subordinate sulcus
extends most frequently to the level of «, the upper end always being separated from
the margin of the hemisphere by a few millimetres of cortex.

With the foregoing observations we conclude the anatomical description of the part
under consideration,
