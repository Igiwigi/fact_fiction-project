are more likely to be (8,) F (30) and (â€”6,)F(30). In fact, in this neighbourhood, the difference of two
successive orders in a series is comparable with the change produced by a 4, displacement in the limit, and
so introduces some uncertainty in allocation. It will be noticed also that, in a few cases, the same line is
adduced to fit two cases, which can only happen if a line happens to be a close doublet, an unlikely
supposition to happen often. We are now in a position to determine the limits with considerable accuracy.
