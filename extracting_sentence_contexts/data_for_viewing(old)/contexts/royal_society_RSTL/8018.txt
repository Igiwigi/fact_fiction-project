S middle ; and there are doubtless cases in which it comes before the middle, its actual
S position being determined, as Professor RAxXKINE himself states, by the position of the
central section of water-borne division. "This sagging-moment, however, is by no means
S *the greatest bending-moment ” experienced by the ship, the distribution of weight and
— buoyancy determining whether the true maximum bending-moment is experienced by
S 8ome section in the fore or after body. I may add, that without accurate calculation
E it is generally possible to tell which body has to bear the greatest strain, by simply ob-
5 8erving at which end the excess of weight is greater. For example, in the * Victoria and
Albert” the excess of weight over buoyancy is greater at the bow than at the stern, and
the section of absolute maximum bending-strain falls in the fore body ; had the reverse
been true, the section would have fallen in the after body, as it does in the cases of the
© Bellerophon” and © Audacious.” Professor RaxKIxE, while recognizing the existence of
these sections of maximum hogging-moment, does not seem to have noticed the fact that
the strains at them would generally be more severe than those at the section of maximum

8agging-moment.
With respect to the actual amounts of the bending-moments experienced by the typical
