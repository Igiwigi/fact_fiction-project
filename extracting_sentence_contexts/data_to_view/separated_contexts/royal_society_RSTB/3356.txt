The orthodox view may be represented somewhat
as follows: That thyroid and parathyroids are separate and distinct organs, having
no connection with each other embryologically, anatomically, or physiologically. Or,
rather, that if there is an anatomical relationship, this is distinctly of a secondary
character. Absence or insufliciency of the thyroid gives rise to chronic symptoms of
cachexia of a cretinoid or myxcedematous nature, while absence or insufficiency of the
parathyroids gives rise to acute symptoms of a nervous character, called tetany,
which are typically exemplified in the case of an animal experimentally deprived of
its parathyroids,

This view has been widely accepted, both in Europe and America, and has been
adopted, among others, by MacCartum.* It has, at any rate, the merit of
simplicity, but it is, in my opinion, not supported by the facts at our disposal. From the physiological standpoint, the independence of thyroid and parathyroid has
been challenged by Vincent and Jouty.}| Forsyru, more recently, has strongly

been unable to verify the statements of VassaLe and GrNnEratt and, later, LusENA, that the effects of
parathyroidectomy come on more suddenly, and are more violent, than those of thyroparathyroidectom y,
and oppose, on the basis of their own experiments, the theory of LusENA that the thyroid is a gland in
which toxic substances are collected from the blood, and, under the influence of the parathyroids,

converted into the innocuous colloid.
