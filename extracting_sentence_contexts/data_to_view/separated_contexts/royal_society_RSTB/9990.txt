This shows the separation between the
mally and sub-optimally oriented cylinders in this interleaved task-specific measure of the neuron’s responses (neurometric
task. We computed the neurometric threshold [42] for disparity threshold) and unrelated visual stimulus preferences of the
discrimination separately for cylinders whose dot motion was neuron (degrees of rotation from the preferred—null motion
either optimally or sub-optimally aligned with the neuronal axis). In fact, there is no significant correlation between neuro-
preference. The neurometric threshold is defined as the differ- metric threshold and cylinder stimulus motion (figure 3a).
