is the same in each case; the value of the enclosed magnetic fields will be as n?:1;
the moment of inertia, and therefore the moment of torsion, will be as nÂ®: 1; and the
included magnetic field
torsion x resistance
of deflection will be n* times as great in the smaller as in the larger instrument. But
there is a limit to the smallness, owing to two causes. The moment of inertia is made
up of two parts, the circuit and the mirror, on which account, when the moment of
inertia of the mirror becomes comparable with that of the circuit, the smaller instru-
ment will have a greater moment of inertia, and, therefore, its sensibility on this
account will be less than that given by the above rule.

The second reason why there is a superior limit to the sensibility as the instrument
is reduced in size is due to the fact that the sensitive plate conducts more heat from
the hot to the cold junction in the case of the shorter plate, and thus, for a given rate
of radiation, the junction will not be so hot ; and, hence, the current will be less than
it would be if the diminished resistance were the only cause of change. It is, there-
fore, necessary to choose some length of plate or width of rectangle which can
conveniently be made in practice, and, assuming this as a constant, to find by
calculation the best values of all the variables, and so, as it were, to fit to the plate
the best possible instrument. Something must be assumed as a starting point, and
this seemed, on the whole, the most convenient. I have assumed the plate, then, to
be composed of two squares of antimony and bismuth, each 5 mm. in the side and
41 mm. thick, soldered edge to edge, thus forming a plate 10x 5X 4mm. This
assumption I have made simply for the sake of numerical calculation ; any size may
