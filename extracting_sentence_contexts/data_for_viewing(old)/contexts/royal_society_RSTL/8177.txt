and if from (1+) times this result we subtract the equation (138), we get

2ar ++ (2p +p?)R*=0.

Hence the Cartesian cyclide is generated as the locus of the curye of intersection of the

From this it follows that a Cartesian cyclide is a surface of reyolution—a fact which

we kney otherwise, it being" the surface generated by the revolution of a Cartesian
oyal about the axis passing through the three collinear single foci.

which stands on the circle of intersection of the sphere (142) and the plane (143), let
us suppose 2”, y”, 2" to be any point on a radius vector from a, y/', z' to any point, of the
