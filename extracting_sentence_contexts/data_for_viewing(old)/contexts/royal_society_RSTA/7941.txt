(c) Between the polygonal and square patterns there is a transitional pattern.

(d) With a certain orientation the polygonal pattern is stable under the influence
of a single shear having a suitable value.

In a layer of air not subjected to shear :

(e) Instability in the form of polygons does not occur suddenly, but the number
of centres of motion increases steadily; the nature of the bounding surfaces makes
no difference, qualitatively, to the effects.

(f) Ascending columns may be produced in air by heating the lower surface and
descending columns in water by cooling the upper surface ; an explanation of the facts
is put forward.

The meteorological effect of the work is to give experimental evidence that the
longitudinal and transverse rolls of a cloud sheet can be produced by a single shear,
and has brought to light a new pattern in the form of a diagonal arrangement of squares.
The experiments also suggest that normal and reticular cloud types are produced by
heating from below and cooling from above respectively.
