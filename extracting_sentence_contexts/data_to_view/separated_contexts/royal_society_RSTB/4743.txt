From a recent comparative account of the excretory glands of Crustacea (4) it appears
that they can be divided into two groups, according to the nature of their efferent ducts. In the one group the duct is intracellular and consists of three, or at least very few,
cells, while in the other it is intercellular and is composed of a large number of cells
and may be a very complex structure. This fact, in itself, appears to the author sufficient
to render it highly improbable that the excretory glands are homologous throughout
the group. Tn the earliest nauplius of Estheria the antennal glands are not fully formed, their
ducts being still in a rudimentary condition. A comparison of the duct rudiments at
this stage with certain ectodermal glands suggests that the duct portions of the glands
are really ectodermal in origin, and hence not homologous with the duct portions of the
maxillary glands.
