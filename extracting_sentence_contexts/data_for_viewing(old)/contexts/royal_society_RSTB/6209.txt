Puparia of Glossina submorsitans at extreme humidities show similar means ; for
example, at 30°C 10 puparia at 19°, relative humidity had a mean duration of
23-0 days and 11 at 88%, relative humidity a mean of 22-6 days.

The fact that low humidity cannot prolong the life of puparia can be shown in
another way. Fig. 7 shows the daily weights of some tachinoides puparia kept at

Fic. 7—Curves showing the changes in weight of eight puparia of Glossina tachinoides kept at
24°C (75-2° F) at a relative humidity of 65%. The circles indicate emergence ; the
remaining puparia died.
