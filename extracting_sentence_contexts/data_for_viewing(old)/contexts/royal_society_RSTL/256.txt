in the Optical Phenomena of Mother of Pearl. 4121

the pearl, and the various hues are thus blended into a white
unformed light, which gives to this substance its high value
as an ornament,

Having thus ascertained that the surface of mother of pearl
is actually grooved, and different in this respect from all other
bodies that have yet been examined, we must now seek, in this
peculiarity of structure, the cause of its optical properties.
The facts which have been detailed in the beginning of this
letter will enable us to draw several important conclusions of
a general nature, but they leave us in the dark respecting the
immediate cause of the phenomena.

Let us now suppose that fig. 5. represents a section of a
plate of mother of pearl, having AanmbcB for its upper sur-
face, and B/a'n'm'b/A' for its lower surface. Let OP be the
line at which the attracting or refractive force ends, and where
the repulsive or reflecting force begins, and let the reflecting
force terminate at MN according to the NewToNtan theory.
We have already seen that when the surface AB of the mother
of pearl is ground as flat as possible, and brought to a high
