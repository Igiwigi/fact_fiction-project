The theories of ranges and pencils, considered irrespect-
are in fact a 8ingle theory, constituting the geometry of one dimen-

Sion. It has been een how in geometry of one dimension a range of points and a pencil '1

may nevertheless stand in certain relations to each other. Sons, the range and pencil may of course coexist in one
common locus in quo; and 8uch coexistence occurs in fac
