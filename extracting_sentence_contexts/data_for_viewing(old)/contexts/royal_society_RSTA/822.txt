On the other hand, for runaway and vacuum transitions, essentially all of the vacuum energy
goes into accelerating the bubble walls to relativistic speeds. The efficiency factor kg must then be
close to unity, and the gravitational waves are then principally sourced by the scalar field gradient
energy.

(b) Acoustic waves

For a general thermal phase transition, the initial collisional phase is short-lived; furthermore, the
scalar field gradient energy scales only as the surface area of the bubbles rather than the volume. A
more significant and long-lasting source of gravitational waves is produced by expanding sound
shells in the fluid kinetic energy after the bubbles have collided.

In fact, for non-ultrarelativistic fluid flows, it is straightforward to obtain the gravitational
wave power spectrum from acoustic waves through a convolution of the fluid velocity power [65],


and, in turn, this can be derived from a fluid profile obtained through the methods discussed
earlier [66]. However, there is incomplete agreement with the fluid velocity power spectrum
observed in simulations, perhaps due to the analytical work of Hindmarsh [66] not modelling
the initial collisions of the fluid profiles. We therefore concentrate for the time being on results
derived from recent very-large-scale simulations [59].

The following ansatz for the gravitational wave power spectrum from acoustic waves was first
put forward in [2], and in [59] was found to generally agree with simulation results. The version
presented here is based on the latter work:
