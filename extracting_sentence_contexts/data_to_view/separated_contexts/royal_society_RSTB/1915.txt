The production of a supply of free mucilage is essential to the ensuring of proper
extrusion. Young, and consequently immature, receptacular portions of the frond
fof F. platycarpus for example are found when cut open to present a woolly
appearance in the interior. This is due to the fact that the loose medullary cell-rows
have not undergone that change in their walls which, later on, leads to the production
of a plentiful supply of mucilage. The latter, however, becomes extremely abundant
when the period of maturity arrives. On the other hand, the tissues of old receptacles are found to be destitute of

A mucilage (which has all been long ago squeezed out) ; and although examination of the
conceptacles may shew them to be full of ripe sexual cells, no extrusion takes place
under these circumstances.
