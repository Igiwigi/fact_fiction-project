The measure
would be strongly positive, for example, if extensive new pro-
tection focused on already-secure examples of ecosystems,
say on public land immune from vegetation loss, and
strongly outweighed loss on other tenures; but this would
obscure a net loss, with the protection part of the ratio not
reflecting impact but simply a change in management

authority. Conversely, the ratio could be negative, indicating
a poor result for conservation, if a small amount of protection
on tenures allowing agricultural expansion avoided loss but
was outweighed by unavoidable loss on those same tenures,
but the impact of that small conservation intervention could
be larger than in the previous case.

(c) Are policy, planning and management directed to
means or ends? One limitation of conceptualizing policy targets and oper-
ational objectives with the results chain (figure 1a) is that
maximizing achievement at one step will not necessarily
maximize achievement at subsequent ones and might, in
fact, compromise them. Maximizing outputs as protected-
area extent, for example, will not necessarily maximize
outcomes for threat levels or state of biodiversity. This
point might seem obvious, but is not reflected in the current
focus of quantitative policy targets on outputs [17], the preoc-
cupation of systematic conservation planning with sampling
outcomes [18] and the scant attention given to impacts in
measures of protected-area management effectiveness [19,65].
