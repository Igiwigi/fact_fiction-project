In 1727 Hates (1) noted that certain stems formed in one season exhibited
an increase and a subsequent decrease in the lengths of their successive internodes.

In 1842 Harrine (2) again directed attention to this rise and fall in the lengths of
the internodes of one axis, but he also proved that the mean lengths of cells taken
from the same tissues in the different internodes do not vary proportionately. This

latter fact was confirmed by Mout (3) in 1876. (And I may here add that my
observations on the epidermis of Lamium album yield the same result.)

In 1878 Askenasy (4) added the information that, in some cases, the first inter-
nodes of an axis are the longest.

In 1883 Maccuratr made observations on Lonicera chinensis, which Wiesner (5)
describes in the following words: “Here a remarkable case occurs, namely, that,
independent of external circumstances, the first internodes increase in length, then
decrease, and once more increase, until near the end of the shoot is another decrease
in the internodes.” The probable explanation of this case will be given in the
sequel.
