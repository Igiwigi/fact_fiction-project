238 MAGNETIC SURVEY IN NORTH AMERICA.

only as conveyed a knowledge of the modes of observation severally employed, and
reduced the:whole to a common unit. The observations thus combined gave for the
highest isodynamic lines of the northern hemisphere, closed and irregularly elliptical
curves, extending acrozs the North American Continent nearly in a north-west and
sonth-east direction, and having their central point, or the point of maximum of Force,
approximately in 52* north latitude, and 2709 east longitude#. To confirm this previously unsuspected characteristic of the magnetic system of the
globe,—to establish beyond a question s0 remarkable a fact in Physical Geography,
—to fix within narrow limits the geographical situation of the point of maximum
corresponding to a particular epoch, —to ascertain with the precision of modern in-
struments and methods the intensity of the magnetic Force at its point of maximum,—
and to assign the form and geographical localities of the isodynamic curves adjacent
to that point, —were objects which presented themselves amongst the most important
desiderata for our present knowledge, and as likely to have a peculiar value at a future
period in respect to the Etiology of the science; when, like the earlier determina-
tions in astronomy, these researches might serve to elucidate the laws of those secular
changes, which, in our present ignorance of the canses of the earth's magnetism,
seem even more mysterions than the apparently complex relations of contemporary
phenomena. The report reſerred to contained accordingly a suggestion of the expediency of
measures being taken to procure a magnetic survey of that portion of the North
American Continent, which is comprised within the isodynamic line of 18 in the
arbitrary scale. This suggestion was treated as second in importance only to the
recommendation which it was the primary object of that report to urge, and which
has since been carried into execution ; viz.
