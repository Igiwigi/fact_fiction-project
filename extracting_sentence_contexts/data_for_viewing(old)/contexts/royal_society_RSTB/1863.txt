of Cardiopteris, and of Bornia; all this leads to the supposition that they belonged
to an epoch much more ancient than that of the upper Coal Measures, for instance,
to the Culm.‚Äù

The last passage above quoted from Srur, in which he selects Senftenbergia,
Scolecopteris, Renwultia, and Marattia, as indicating stages in the progress of the
Marattiaceous sorus, cannot be accepted as cogent, when it is remembered that
Senftenbergia is of doubtful affinity, and that Dancites with its synangial sorus is
recorded from older strata than any of the other three. My own opinion is that,
even without urging strongly the inherent weakness of negative evidence, which
would lay stress on the fact that certain types are not yet recorded from certain
strata, the question of the time and mode of origin of the synangial sori cannot be
settled on the ground of present paleophytological knowledge ; as regards the facts
available from the study of fossils the question should be regarded as still open.

The most that can be said with certainty is that the earliest ferns of which the
sporangia are at all accurately known have separate sporangia; but on the other
hand, both the type with coalescent sporangia, and that with separate sporangia
associated in a sorus, are very ancient, and have been recognised as having existed
already in Marattiaceous ferns from the lower Coal Measures. In arriving at these

conclusions I do not ignore the possibility that ferns interesting for comparison, or
