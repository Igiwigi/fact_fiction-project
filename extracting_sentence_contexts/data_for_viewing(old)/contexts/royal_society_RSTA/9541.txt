this does occur, it would be not improbable that such disturbance should lead, in
some cases, to an electron emission. Experimental evidence shows that when atoms
enter into chemical reactions at ordinary temperatures, it is rarely (if ever) that the
accompanying disturbance increases the kinetic energy of any of the electrons
sufficiently to enable them to escape ; but if the conditions are arranged so that the
electrons already possess considerable kinetic energy in virtue of their thermal
agitation, it would seem possible that the stimulus of chemical action should have
the effect of increasing this energy sufficiently to cause some of the electrons to
overcome the forces tending to retain them in the substance. It seems, therefore,
that chemical action at a high temperature might be expected to result in an electron
emission in cases where the temperature itself is not sufficient to produce this effect,
or where it produces it only to a much smaller extent. This conclusion is supported
by the fact that an increased emission occurs when certain chemically active gases
are allowed to enter the discharge tube, but it must be remembered that there is
another manner in which these gases may act in aiding the escape of electrons from
the glowing cathode, namely, by causing an alteration in the surface conditions
whereby the minimum amount of energy an electron must possess in order to escape
from the cathode is reduced. Such a reduction might be caused by the formation of
an electric double layer at the surface of the cathode which would create a force
tending to drag out the electrons. There is already a considerable amount of
evidence of the existence of these double layers in certain cases, and this view has
been put forward to explain the action of hydrogen in increasing the electron
emission from platinum.*
