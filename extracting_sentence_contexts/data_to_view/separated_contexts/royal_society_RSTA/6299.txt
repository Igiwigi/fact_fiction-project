The fidelity of the example in figure 2c at the final time is F > 0.999. The
high performance of fidelity in short time with both attractive and repulsive interactions is plotted
in figure 3. The oscillations are due to the fact that the Gaussian ansatz (2.3) is not the solution of
BECs with atomic interactions. It is reported that fidelity is improved by using a soliton ansatz in
the attractive nonlinear system [17]. Thus in this case, the strong attractive interaction will lead
to the period oscillations (see dotted-green line g = â€”2) due to the Gaussian ansatz we applied in
variational approach.
