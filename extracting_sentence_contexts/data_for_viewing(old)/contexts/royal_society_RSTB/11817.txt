masses of cells contained in a chitin shell, that can withstand
desiccation and freezing (and can either disperse or stick to
the parent colony [50)).

Positive associations between dispersal and sexual repro-
duction [51] are also widely observed, though we also list
known exceptions to the pattern. Vegetative growth in mod-
ular organisms (e.g. many plants) can lead to offspring that
can be considered independent in demographic studies
[52]-runners in strawberries being a familiar example.
Such offspring typically grow near their parent, while sexu-
ally produced seed may be equipped with traits that ensure
dispersal. The fact that vegetative growth occurs clonally
(i.e. only mitotic cell divisions between parent and offspring)
may appear obvious, but it is not. No biological law prevents
there to be a fertilization event somewhere among the many
cells of a modular organism, followed by vegetative growth
from that point onwards (i.e. it is valid to ask why strawberry
runners begin growing from near the root, when they could
also start from flowers). Likewise, no law states that disper-
sive structures cannot be formed asexually. For example, in


many fungi, a fertilized mycelium can keep dividing, taking via currents and storms [68]. Porifera sex results in the pro- El
