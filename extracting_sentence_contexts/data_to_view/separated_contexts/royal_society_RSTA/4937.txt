This process was repeated until he had 12 coils of wire,
all insulated from each other. He then connected the free ends of all the even coils to make one
continuous length and likewise with the odd coils. He now had two helices, the ends of one of
which he connected to a galvanometer (a device invented a few years earlier to detect the presence
of an electric current) and the other to a voltaic battery.

5In fact, only the first part of the paper was read on 24 November. The remainder was read on two later occasions, on 8 and
15 December.

7Faraday to Hudson, 9 April 1832, in [1, vol. 2, letter 566]. At first, Faraday saw no response from the galvanometer when switching on the battery, but
by experimenting with longer coiled wires, different materials for the conducting wires and more
powerful batteries he was finally able to induce a small reaction in the galvanometer needle,
deflecting one way on switching the battery on and the other when disconnecting it.
