Observation of oxides
mostly on the (110) Cu plane is in contrast with the literature [39], which shows preferable growth
of CuO on the (111) Cu plane. As the (110) planes have higher numbers of broken bonds and
surface energy [39,40] compared to other low indices planes, (110) planes should be the prefer site
for oxidation, but growth of oxides to the highest thickness has been noted on the (111) plane [41]. This is probably due to the fact that because of high surface energy nucleation of oxides initiate
throughout the (110) plane. The formation of highly dense nuclei makes low angle boundaries
