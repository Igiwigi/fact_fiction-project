— Without an existence result, what do numerical calculations approximate? Put more
abstractly, how can one prove the convergence of a numerical scheme without being able
to guarantee the existence of an underlying solution towards which to converge? (This
is, in fact, possible under the assumption that a sufficiently smooth solution does exist, see
Chernyshenko et al. [8].)

— One could hope that a better mathematical understanding of the equations will lead to
an enhanced physical understanding of the phenomena they model. (It is probably more
reasonable to expect that a better mathematical understanding will require an enhanced
physical understanding.)

— Some very natural quantitative bounds on solutions are lacking, e.g. how to estimate the
maximum value of the velocity in the future given the initial velocity profile. (In fact,
bounds of this sort would be sufficient to solve the regularity problem, see §6.)

— Theoretical methods to treat this problem should also apply to other PDE models. This
is not entirely clear, however. There are artificial models that share many of the features
of the Navier-Stokes equations that have regular solutions (e.g. the dissipative Burgers
equation [9]) and other such models that have solutions that blow up in finite time [10,11].
It may be that an eventual proof/disproof of the regularity of solutions of the Navier—
Stokes equations will involve such particular features of the equations that it says little
about other models.

— Any such long-standing open mathematical question—particularly one so relevant to an
important problem in physics—becomes something of a ‘grand challenge’, not to mention
