Sooner or later, in perhaps a
large proportion of the cases, it will give rise somewhere or another to another species,
which again will commence as a single one or as a few individuals in a definite spot. If this spot were always near the centre from which the original species started, we
should on the average, after some time, get a series of concentric circles, representing
the various species developed, the largest circle representing the oldest species. But
in actual fact we know that new species may develop, as they must have developed
in Ceylon, near to the margin of the area occupied by the parent species. Further,
while each new species on the average will be at approximately the same degree of
adaptation as its forerunners, this will rarely happen exactly in any individual case,
nor will the effects of chance be the same, so that the size of the area occupied
will, in comparatively few cases, indicate the exact age of the species as compared
with others of the same genus or family.* It will generally happen that no two
species are exactly alike, and consequently that while the “circle” of species 2 will
for a long time be enclosed in that of species 1, it may sometimes exceed it all round,
or overlap it at one place, where the conditions of life suit 2 but not 1. Also,
obviously, as the circles spread, the mere effect of climate will tend to make them
spread more to east and west than to north and south.
