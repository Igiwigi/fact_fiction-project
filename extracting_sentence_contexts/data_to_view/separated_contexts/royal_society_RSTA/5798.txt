McCrea proposed in 1951 [55], see also [56], that incorporated this idea within general relativity
as cosmic tension (negative pressure, p = —p) leading to a global state of constant density. This
ingenious argument of McCrea implied that expansion continuously creates new matter to keep
a constant mass density. (This is again to be compared with the inflationary idea of expansion at
constant density coming from a false-vacuum.)

These ideas were considered as rivals to the Friedmann models for a period, until it was found
in 1952 by W. Baade that previous astronomical calculations of distance calibration were in fact
wrong by a factor of two or more, a fact that erased the initial motivation for such alternative
models. For a modern reincarnation of the steady-state idea, see [57].

(m) G6del’s universe

Another important advance in theoretical cosmology before the 1960s was K. Gédel’s rotating
universe published in 1949 [58], a zero-pressure fluid solution to Einstein’s equations with a
negative cosmological constant.
