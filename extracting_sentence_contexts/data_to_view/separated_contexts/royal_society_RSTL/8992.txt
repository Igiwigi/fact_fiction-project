For example, returning to our former sketch, the area
enclosed by the line þF and the angular line 6 g was an area the minimal stimulation of
any part of which was followed by a local contraction of the area 9 bf, while minimal
stimulation of any point outside of the lines 96,7 was followed by a general contraction
of the entire strip situated ontside of these lines. And of course there are other cases
in which even the strongest stimulation of such an insular area as 9b f would fail to
elicit any thing further than a local contraction of that area.

(4) From all this, then, we see that exploration by graduated stimuli reveals, first,
differences in the degrees of excitability of closely contiguous tissue-areas, and, second,
differences in the degrees of permeability to stimuli on the part of sach areas—there
being thus tissne-areas which admit of being more or less physiologically isolated from
the rest of the tissue-mass by section. And the fact that in all these cases the lines of
demarcation between the differentiated tissue-tracts are 80 sharply defined constitates, I
think, an additional support to the hypothesis concerning the presence of nerves, or
* lines of discharge” *,

* Tt has heen s8uggested to me that contractile waves are merely muscle-wayes, and that their blockage in
contractile strips is due to shock. This, of conrse, would be a delightfully simple solution of the difficulties
besetting this subject, and it is naturally the firs one that occurs to an experimenter. But further obseryation
shows that the tissues of Medusw cannot be made to suffer shock unless the tissue-tracts affected by the section
are exceedingly narrow, while blocking of contractile wayes may take place in strips of considerable width.
