No satisfactory reason can at present be given for the weakness or
absence of these lines in the flash spectrum. Notwithstanding these instances of disagreement between the intensities of the
Fraunhofer lines of an element and their flash spectrum equivalents, the general
agreement between the two spectra is so striking that it can scarcely be maintained
that there is a fundamental difference in the conditions under which they are
produced. The abnormally strong lines in the flash, which in so many cases are also
lines which are enhanced in the spark, would, it is true, indicate that some of the
radiating gas at all events must be in a condition differing from that in the absorbing
layer, and this, it must be acknowledged, is of great interest and importance,
particularly in view of the fact pointed out by Fow. Er, that under some stellar
conditions, ¢.g., in « Cygni, these particular lines constitute a separate and much
simpler spectrum quite free from admixture with the ordinary are lines. *
