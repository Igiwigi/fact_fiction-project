and the associated multi-faceted support infrastructure. Moreover, it has been
estimated [4] that the cost of providing the power to spin the rotor is an order
of magnitude less than that required for a screw-driven vessel of comparable size

sailing at the same speed. The fact that that speed would usually be less than half
that of a diesel-powered craft in normal operation is immaterial for the purpose
of cloud seeding.

An artist’s impression of such a vessel is shown in figure 9. While the origina’
Flettner vessel that crossed the Atlantic in 1926 was propelled by two purely
cylindrical rotors, in the conceptual design of the cloud-seeding craft shown in
the figure, the rotors have a number of discs mounted along their length. In fact,
Thom [52] carried out a number of wind-tunnel experiments that suggested tha
the inclusion of such discs markedly improved rotor performance at high spin
rates. Inevitably, however, the scope of that experimental exploration was limited
and was certainly not conceived as contributing to the particular requirements
of the cloud-seeding craft. Moreover, nearly 80 years on, as in so many areas,
