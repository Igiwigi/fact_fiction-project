Dr. Parry in
his treatise -on the pulse for example, relates a case where feeling alone was
lost in one arm, and voluntary power alone in the other. But these are not
the only nor indeed the most important functions of the spinal nerves. All of
them contribute to the formation of the ganglionic system, on which the life
of the animal, as will appear from many facts I am about to state, immediately
depends. It is evident from what has been said, that the ganglions and plexuses re-
semble each other in their nature ; and as the neryes which terminate in them
come from all the most distant parts of the nervous system, some from the
brain, and some from the lower extremity, and all intermediate parts of the
Spinal marrow, we cannot help supposing, that there is some design in thus
uniting nerves which arise from 80 many different parts of these organs. One
of the most striking differences between the ganglionic nervyes, and those pro-
ceeding directly from the brain and spinal marrow, is that even independently
of the ganglions and plexuses, the former every where more freely anastomose,
if I may borrow a term from the sanguiferons system ; while the latter proceed
in a more direct course, being less connected with each other in their progress
to the parts on which they bestow sensation and yoluntary power ; $till further
demonstrating the care with which nature blends the power of the ganglionic
nerves.
