The relative weakness of this auditory rhythms. Stepping back to the larger picture, the additional neural
regions and pathways for vocal learning in parrots compared
to complex vocal learning songbirds are intriguing when jux-
taposed with the complexity of the human dorsal auditory
stream, which is involved in vocal learning and BPS. This jux-
taposition, combined with the fact that only parrots and
humans show spontaneous BPS to music, suggest that spon-
taneous BPS has an evolutionary relationship to high vocal
learning rather than to complex vocal learning more generally.

5. The revised vocal learning and rhythmic

synchronization hypothesis

The original VLH proposed that the capacity for BPS relied
on neural substrates that first evolved to serve complex
vocal learning. Based on the considerations reviewed above,
here I propose the revised vocal learning and rhythmic syn-
chronization hypothesis or ‘rVLH’.
