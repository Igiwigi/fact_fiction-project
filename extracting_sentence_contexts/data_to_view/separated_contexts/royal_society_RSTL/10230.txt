But with carbonic oxide the velocity observed is only 1090 metres per second, the
calculated velocity being 1940. This gas they consider, therefore, to be an exception
to the general rule. When, however, a mixture of carbonic oxide and hydrogen is
exploded with oxygen, they find the observed velocity of explosion to approximate to
the calculated velocity, and explain the fact by supposing the hydrogen to com-
municate to the carbonic oxide a law of detonation analogous to its own. With
mixtures of carbonic oxide and nitrous oxide, a similar divergence between the cal-
; culated and observed velocities of explosion is found, whereas with hydrogen and
other gases containing hydrogen, exploded with nitrous oxide, there is a very close
agreement between the observed and calculated velocities. BERTHELOT and ViEILE
dried the explosion tube before each experiment, and employed dry gases.
