050 watt per degree, as in the majority of our experiments. It will therefore
evidently be unnecessary to take account of this in any of the calculations.
a To find the radial distribution of temperature in the liquid, assuming the flow to
%“ be linear, I will take first the case of the metallic flow-tube, which is much the
8 simplest. The differential equation of the radial distribution of temperature, neglecting
2 the minute effect of longitudinal conduction, is
o
S ad(krdbjdr\jdr=-4-verdé/da . . ..... . (tL),
S
4 in which & is the thermal conductivity of the liquid, and ¢ the specific heat per unit
6 volume, v the velocity of the stream, 6 the temperature, 7 the distance from the axis,
= and a the distance along the tube. The velocity v is a function of 7, which can be
‘2 easily calculated if the viscosity is assumed constant. As a matter of fact, both
'B the viscosity and the conductivity vary rapidly with change of temperature. The
EB viscosity at 100° is nearly six times less than at 0° C., and its variation is accurately
3 known. But if we assume both conductivity and viscosity constant (as we are
cs practically compelled to do, since the variation of conductivity with temperature is
£ quite uncertain) we shall obtain a solution which is sufficiently simple to be useful,
% and which can be strictly applied to small changes of temperature.
= To simplify the solution still further, I shall assume the longitudinal temperature
g gradient d@/dx constant over the cross-section of the tube at any point, and equal
: to 0'/l, where 6 is the rise of temperature observed in a length 2. This will not

F is rapidly changing, but it will very fairly represent the limiting state, which is
= attained when the liquid has flowed along the tube for some distance.
