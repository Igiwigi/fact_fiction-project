to that organ. Throughout the whole of its course, from the ganglion to this
division into branches, it distributes filaments to the dorsal yessel and to the
cesophagus. TI have not yet succeeded in tracing it in this insect beyond the
anterior part of the stomach, but in the Gryllus viridissimus, L1NN., I was
once enabled to follow its central division along the whole of the stomach, and
part of the small intestine, from which, with a little care, it was readily de-
tached. Its length from the ganglion to the trifid division in the Sphinx, is
much increased during the changes of the insect, and corresponds precisely
with the elongation that takes place in the cesophagus. The form of the gan-
glion undergoes no alteration. From the analogy that exists in the distribu-
tion of this nerve to that of the eighth pair in the vertebrated animals, it is
probable that its functions are of a somewhat similar nature, â€”that in reality
it is the par vagum, or pneumogastric nerve of insects. In fact, this is the
pretty generally received opinion respecting it, and is clearly that of STraus
DuRCKnAE1M, who describes it in his Anatomy of the Melolontha vulgaris. It
must be confessed, however, that there are objections to such an opinion, since
it is not yet proved to distribute any filaments to the respiratory organs,
although it can hardly be doubted that such distribution does really exist,
when we remember the abundance of tracheal vessels which ramify upon the
stomach, and with which its filaments must necessarily come in contact. The
other nerves from the cerebral lobes arise nearer the lateral surfaces. The
first of these are destined for the future antennz, and proceed from the front,
near the origin of the cords, [PI. XII. and XIII. fig. 2. (D).] At the last period
of the larya state they are of considerable size and length, and lie packed in
sigmoid folds on each side the head, within the cranium. The next are the
