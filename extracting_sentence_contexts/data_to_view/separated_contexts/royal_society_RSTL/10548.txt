J. 0. Mo CONNEL ON AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION

The above observations relate to values of Ã¾ ranging from 4* to 38%, Por larger
values I required a plate cut parallel to the axis. So I bad two new faces cut, on
Plate 2, at right angles to the former ones and therefore nearly parallel to the axis,
forming in fact a new plate, which I will call Plate 3. The two new faces were good
planes and made an angle of about 24" with one another, and not more than 9' with
the axis. In the observations on Plate 3, it was necezary to 8et all four faces nearly parallel
to the axis of rotation of the spectrometer table 80 as to secure that the axis should
lie in the plane of measurement.
