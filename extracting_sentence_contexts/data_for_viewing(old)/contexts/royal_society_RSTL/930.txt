other, like all refractions, begins at s0me small distance before
the rays enter.

The writers just now quoted assert, that if the crystal be
turned round $0 as to assume different positions, there is one
in which the line appears single. The fact is very different, as
follows. When the crystal is turned round, the unusual image
moves round also, and appears above the other; the greatest
distance between the two images is when they are parallel to
the line bisecting one of the acute angles of the parallelogram
through which the rays pass; when the images are parallel to a
line bisecting one of the obtuse angles they seem to coincide ;
but they will be found, if observed more nearly, to coincide only
in part. Thus (in fig. 9g.) AB and CD are the two black lines
at their greater distance, and their extremities A and C, Band D
are even with one another; that is, the figure formed by join-
ing Aand C, B and D is a rectangle. But in the other case
(fig. 8.) AB and CD being the lines, the space CB (equal in
