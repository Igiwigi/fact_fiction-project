We sum first with respect to m; but in forming the sum we take account of the
fact that sin*(n/36) does not change when x is replaced by 36—n. For example,
let F be equal to 1 at the points indicated in the table, and zero at other points.
Then the contribution to the terms containing any m of the two parallels given by n
and 36—n is either 0, 1, or 2, according as a 1 occurs on neither parallel (for the
particular m in question), on one, or on both. This number 0, 1, or 2 is to be
multiplied by the value of cos (m7/36) for the chosen m; but the same value for the
cosine occurs at the meridian given by 72—m, and the same numerical value with the
B opposite sign occurs at the meridians given by 36—m and 36+m. We condense into
Q one term the contributions of the eight points given by n, 36—n, m, 72—m, 36 + m,
~ and take the ranges of m and n to be respectively 0 to 17 and 1 to 18. Thus, as the
multiplier of cos (m7/36) sin? (7/36), we have an integral number which necessarily

= lies between —4 and 4, and may be zero, and we have transformed the sum into a
