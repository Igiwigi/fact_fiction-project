The decompoxsition in this experiment seems to have been effected by the me-
chanical agency of the electric fluid. The fine electric dart shooting out from
the invisible gold points may have actually cleayed a molecule of water which
happened to be fayourably situated, and thus its oxygen and hydrogen were
disengaged at the point where the mechanical cleavage took place #,

5. It does not appear to me at all necessary that zinc and copper should be
thrown into opposite electric states to produce yoltaic action, I shall make
no suppositions with regard to those states, but ground my views of yoltaic
action on well established facts.. Zinc has a much more powerful attraction
for oxygen than copper; and yet copper has also a decided attraction for it,
otherwise there could be no salts of this metal, Let us now suppose, merely
for the sake of illustration, that a molecule of water is composed of an atom of
oxygen united to an atom of hydrogen. In the Plate VIII.
