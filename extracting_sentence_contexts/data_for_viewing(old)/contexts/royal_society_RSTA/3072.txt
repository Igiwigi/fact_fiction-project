near the dark fringe’—this operating condition has many advantages (such as lower power on
the photodetector, a higher dynamic range and the option of power recycling). In this state, if
a gravitational wave passes through the Michelson interferometer, stretching and compressing
space-time in the arms differentially, the interference signal on the photodetector will change
perceivably. However, for the tiny effect of a gravitational wave to be discernible from all other
noise sources the interferometer is subject to, all occurring noise sources have to be drastically
reduced. One major contributing factor in terms of noise is the laser light source itself. By means
of various different stabilization schemes the technical noise of the employed lasers with regard to
power, frequency and beam geometry (mode shape and beam pointing) is routinely reduced as far
as technically possible. However, on a quantum level we face a new and fundamental challenge:
quantum noise of the laser light.

One could argue that quantum noise must be an inordinately small effect. However, the fact
today is that the advanced gravitational wave detectors (such as aLIGO, adVIRGO and GEO-HF)
