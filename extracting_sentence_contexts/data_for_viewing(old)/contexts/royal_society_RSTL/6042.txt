called brown, which generally passes for a separate colour. Persons not well yersed
the principles of colour, are often reluctant to admit that these variations of tone are
really the same hue. Hence we may easily see what a great probability there is that
the colour-blind may acquire the habit of attaching the names of different colours to
what are in reality only varieties of the same sensation ; and as this habit dates from

much more difficult to get rid of than might be supposed. The sufferer may find him-
elf continually blundering, but he must go through a very rigid self-examination before
he can trace this to the fact that some of the principal ideas he has all his life held npon
colour are mere delusions.

Taking red as an example; it is in the highest degree natural that persons who are
continually seeing this colour under the appearance of dark yellow, should imagine that
the latter sensation (which is certainly very distinct from that of full yellow) is what
corresponds to the term red, and the notion that they cannot really see red at all is one
they may have the greatest difficulty in comprehending. Hence the very general asser-

Qtion by the colour-blind that they do see red, an assertion which IT think has been far

more readily accepted than it ought to be *.
