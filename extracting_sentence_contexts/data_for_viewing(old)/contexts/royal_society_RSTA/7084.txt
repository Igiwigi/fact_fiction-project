term in (57) is the important one, and the rate of growth becomes linear:

R, = DN, Qa/6. (59)
The change-over from parabolic to linear occurs at a supersaturation 7, roughly given by
0) ~ YXo/kT. (60)

For reasonable values of y and 3, 7, ~ 10~°. Above o, one should observe only the linear law
(59); below o,, all the rates of growth between (58) and (59) could be expected. As far as
we know there is no experimental evidence for such a critical supersaturation.

On the other hand, we observe frequently (Bunn 1949; Humphreys-Owen 1949) that
the rate of growth is substantially smaller than the linear law (59) would suggest; sometimes
a crystal surface does not grow at all in spite of the fact that it is in contact with supersatura-
tions as large as ¢ ~ 0-1. This could possibly be interpreted as being due to the absence of
dislocations in the surface or to the presence of so many that the mean distance between them
is smaller than 2p,. In this last case, the number of dislocations per sq.cm. would have to
be of the order of 10'2cm.~®, which is high. Moreover, in this case, the dislocations would
have to be distributed in a peculiar way, with least density at the centre of each face; for
otherwise the growth, when it did occur, would be most rapid at the corners, i.e. dendritic.
We are more inclined to think that the number of dislocations involved is quite small, and
that they are situated near the middle of the face. The changes in growth rate could be due to
rearrangements of the dislocations or to the effect of impurities adsorbed on the steps. The
required amount of such impurity is very small indeed. For example, if the number of
dislocations per sq.cm. is as high as 108, the number of atomic sites on the step-lines connecting
them need not exceed 10~ of all sites in the area.
