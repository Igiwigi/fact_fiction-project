Statistical self-similarity of the type S,4(t)~ tS can be expected in the inertial range. The
Kolmogorov (K41 model) assumed that all statistically averaged moments (the q-th order
structure functions S(q,1) ~ (|Sv;|1), dvj = v(x + 1) — v(x)) at scale | depend only on the mean
dissipation rate and | with the scaling (|5u;|7) ~ 189), Scaling ¢(q) =q/3 was found in the K41
model for fully developed isotropic turbulence. Nonlinear behaviour of the structure function
scaling ¢(q) was observed in SW by Burlaga [63]. Examples of structure function of high orders
(with orders up to 9) for SW ion flux (BMSW measurements) are presented in figure 7. The linear
dependence S,(t) ~ t1, where H = const, is observed only in a limited range of scales (less than
0.1 s): dependence ¢(q) is obviously nonlinear.

For intermittent turbulence in the usual fluid [64], it was found that the log-log plot of
structure functions S,(/) versus S)(/) (moments of different order) lies on a straight line in a
range which is much wider than the log-log plot of S,(/) versus / itself. This empirical fact was
called extended self-similarity (ESS). Such behaviour of generalized self-similarity holds even at
moderate Reynolds numbers over the range which is substantially longer than the inertial one.
The extended self-similarity corresponds to the scaling in a turbulent cascade not with respect to
the usual distance, but with respect to an effective scale defined by the third order moment of the
velocity field. Hidden statistical symmetries of the motion equations, hierarchy of moments and
multifractality are behind the property of the ESS. The ESS is observed in turbulent systems such
as usual fluid, space plasma, plasma of fusion devices (see review in [26]). The ESS property is
