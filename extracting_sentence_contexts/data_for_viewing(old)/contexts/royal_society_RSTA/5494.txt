studying the anthropogenic drivers of climate change. From an economic and long-
erm policy perspective, it needs to become recognized that the current framework
for comparing greenhouse gases using GWPs is not aligned with stabilization or
with economic optimization. In addition, it is becoming increasingly important
o develop ways of considering changes in emissions of different greenhouse gases
hat are closely aligned with keeping to a climate-stabilization goal. However,
his raises the major issue of reducing scientific uncertainties that underlie all
comparisons of emissions of different gases.

The standard way of comparing emissions of different greenhouse gases is
hrough GWP values based on RF integrated over a fixed time horizon, but
his does not provide a way of equating emissions of short- and long-lived gases
in the context of climate stabilization. For this, it is necessary to cover the fact
hat a permanent reduction in emissions of a short-lived greenhouse gas can only
justify a temporary increase in emissions of COÂ».

Furthermore, estimated uncertainties in GWP values have become larger
owing to the wide range of potential CO2 removal rates in the future and their
dependence on climate change [6]. Uncertainties in the removal rates of methane
26-28] and a widening range of indirect effects for this gas [7] are also creating
growing issues for the use of the GWP in a policy framework.
