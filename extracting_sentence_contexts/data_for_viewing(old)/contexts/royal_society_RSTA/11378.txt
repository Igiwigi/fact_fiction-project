the hope of determining all the derivatives of the highest order that occur in
terms of derivatives of lower order. If this were possible, substitution in the
equations of differential elements such as

dl = adx + hdy + gdz

and suecessive integration would ultimately lead to v. It appears in general, how-
ever, that relations of interdependence among the equations prevents them from


DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND ORDER, 45

being adequate for the purpose at any stage; the relations are, in fact, satisfied
conditions of compatibility. This method is, therefore, ineffective.

An effective method can, however, be obtained as follows. Restricting ourselves
for the moment to the equation of the second order with two compatible equations
also of that order*—the restriction is made only to simplify the explanations—we
have v as expressible in terms of two arbitrary functions. Hence each of the
quantities 1, m, n (and therefore any combination of v, 7, m, 7), can be expressed
in terms of two arbitrary functions. Now in one of the compatible equations we
have one arbitrary function which is to be identified with one of the arbitrary
functions in v; hence it is to be expected that a proper combination of 2, J, m, 2,
is an intermediary integral of that equation involving a new arbitrary function, which
must be identified with the other of the arbitrary functions in ».
