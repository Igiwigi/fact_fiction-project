Exponential and semi-uniform stability with polynomial rates can also be approached by
means of Fourier multiplier techniques. We are unable to discuss this approach in our short
survey, and we instead refer to the interesting recent paper [96] (and the references therein) for
details. In particular, the paper contains versions of Theorem 3.5 for unbounded semigroups; see
e.g. [96, Section 4].

4. Applications to second-order Cauchy problems

Since this survey emphasizes abstract aspects we found it instructive, in passing to descriptions
of illustrative applications of our techniques, to begin with a discussion of an abstract model and
then to illustrate briefly, in the concluding remarks, how it relates to damped wave equations.
This subsection is based on the presentation in a very nice paper by Anantharaman & LÃ©autaud
[97, Part II], which in fact considers a slightly more general set-up than ours. Note that similar
arguments can be found in a number of papers and books dealing with asymptotic behaviour of
hyperbolic equations and operator matrices, but we refrain from mentioning all of them here.
For the remainder of this section, let A and B be self-adjoint positive semi-definite operators on
a Hilbert space X. Assume that A has compact resolvent, and that B is bounded. Assume further
that
||Bx\| > 0 for every (non-zero) eigenvector x of A. (4.1)

The general approach given below in fact works under much milder assumptions on A and B, but
in view of our applications to damped wave equations, it is reasonable to restrict our attention to
this particular setting. Consider then the following second-order Cauchy problem in X:

it+Biu+Au=0, u(0)=u0, i(0)=1, (4.2)
