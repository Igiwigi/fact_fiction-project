B. SKINNER ON SOFT X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY OF SOLIDS

masses’ of electrons occupying levels in the main body of the band and levels corre-
sponding to points near the various corners of the zone. Since we have to deal with
N,,,(Z), we must correct for the fact that the band ends occur also on the N,(£)
curve, as has already been mentioned. In this way, an estimate of the effective mass
appropriate to any particular band end may be obtained and it is found that values
considerably smaller than the electron mass are obtained in most cases, not only for
the extreme band ends, but for the stronger band ends too. Thus, in the case of Si,
assuming that half of the electrons of highest energy are to be found in the N,,,(£)
band ends, the remainder being f-electrons, we obtain values of 4m for the first, and
about ;'gm for the extreme band end.
