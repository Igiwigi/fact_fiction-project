There is no
loss of generality in putting all but two of the quantities (2,4, », e, s, 7) equal to zero;
in fact this leaves in the formulee a single arbitrary quantity, which is the right number,
since the ratios B : C : D : E have to satisfy only the two conditions C=0, D=0. ApDp1T10N, Nov. 10, 1862. I take the opportunity of remarking, with reference to my memoir * On a New
Auxiliary Equation in the Theory of Equations of the Fifth Order®,” that I recently
discovered that the auxiliary equation there considered is in fact due to JacoBi, who, in
his paper, © Observatiunculz ad theoriam zquationum pertinentes f,” under the heading
* Observatio de zquatione sexti gradus ad quam wzquationes quinti gradus reyocari pos-
sunt,” gives the theory, and observes that the equation is of the form

$+ap'+4,9%+a;=324/ Os,
and mentions that the value of @, is easily found to be (I adapt his notation to the
denumerate form (a, Þ, c, d, e, fv, 1'=0)
=40a0—166d4+6&
(this ought, however, to be divided by —2), but that the values of a,, ag © paullo am-
pliores calculos poscunt.”

The value of the coefficient in question is correctly obtained (page 270 of my memoir)

in the form

—
+2(—16a6+4b4—&)
+12ae;

but the reduced yalue is given in two places (page 271) as equal to
—32 ae, this should be —20 ae,
+ 80d, b + 804d,
— 3a, MF — 30,
The last-mentioned correct, value was used in obtaining the coefficient for the standard
form, which coefficient is given correctly, page 274.
