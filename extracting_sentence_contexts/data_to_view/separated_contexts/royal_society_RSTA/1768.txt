The Lagrangian function of the system is still of the form

L+ < | (BE?) de,

L being that part of it which is not directly determined by the conditions in the field
and which will as usual be assumed to be a function of the positions and velocities
of the electric and magnetic elements only. The sequence of changes is then best
described by the fact that the action integral

b Lf 2 2 ’ fia [n+ | (BE) av]

taken between fixed time limits is stationary subject to the implied conditions of the
field. If we assume generally that there are a number of discrete electric particles as
well in the field, these conditions may be written in the form

div E—47de = 0,
div (B—H)+472m = 0,

Curl H-+ gE _ its; = 0,
ce dt c

we - ag —4r Dm», = 0,
wherein e is the charge of the typical electron and y, its velocity, m is the strength of
the typical magnetic particle whose velocity is v,, and the sum Z in each equation is
taken per unit volume at each place over the respective elements indicated in it.
