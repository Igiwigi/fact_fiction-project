the main branch, than that these movements of the pigments are due to amoeboid
movements in the plasma therein. We have some slight evidence that the pigment
movements are due to a pressure from the centre, inasmuch as in old Mysids the
pigment at times bursts the frondose extremities of the chromatophores, and exudes
into the surrounding tissues. Light is known to set up changes in the turgor of such
chlorophyll-containing cells as the guard-cells of stomata. We know that light sets
up movements of the pigments by its direct action on the chromatophores (Section IX.,
pp. 851-858), and suggest, not as an ascertained fact, but as a subject for further
experimentation, that pigment movements are due to changes in turgor of the
chromatophore-centres ; which changes may be produced by the direct action of
light, and also by the nervous system.

Whatever view we take of the finer details of structure, and of the mode of
working of this organ, its complex structure, glandular secretory activity, the power
of growth and increase in size and number of its individual “cells,” is beyond
question, All the Mysidee we have examined present a similarly organised system of
chromataphores.

B. Decapods.—In spite of long-continued and renewed attempts to resolve the
structure of chromatophores in Decapods, we have only partially succeeded. In the
