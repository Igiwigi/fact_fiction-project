skull capacity and current appreciation of intellectual ability.
3 My first series is contained in Table XXV. We have here the estimated skull
pacities of thirty-five living anatomists. The list contains the names of many of
‘Bgreat scientific reputation, and of others of less distinction. It will be seen that
about the middle of the list, if we divide at D. Herpurn, the eighteenth man, certain
S transfers would occur from the upper to the lower half, and vice versd, if we judged by
% formula (18) and not (14). But these transfers are of men having roundly about the
= same skull capacity, and I think that generally we may feel quite satisfied with the
E accordance of the two series.* Now the average capacity of the first eighteen
4 anatomists is 1601 cub, centims., and of the last seventeen anatomists is 1468 cub.
3g centims. There is thusa most substantial difference.t Yet he would bea bold man who
S would assert that there is a substantial average intellectual superiority in the first half.
E Tn fact, a number of most capable men fall into the last nine, and J. KoLLMANN, one of
© the ablest living anthropologists, has absolutely the smallest skull capacity !

My second list contains the estimated skull capacity of twenty-five members of the
teaching staff of University College, London. I give here the actual head measure-
ments, as possibly of service in the future; those of the anat« mists are published in
the ‘Journal of Anatomy’ (see above). Here the first thirteen have a mean skull
capacity of 1579 cubic centims. and the last twelve of 1436 cubic centims.—again a

* We must always remember that (14) is & priori to be considered a much better formula than (18),
for the change of its constants from race to race is far less.

+ The mean of the whole series as given by (14) is 1537, and by (18) is 1534, a remarkable accordance
