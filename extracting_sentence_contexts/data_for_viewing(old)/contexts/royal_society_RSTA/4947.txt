The key to proving theorem 1.4 is that, so long as q > g, the unstable homology is negligible in
the Grothendieck—Lefschetz trace computation.

It would be interesting to compute what a heuristic similar to heuristic 1.2 suggests about the
average number of points on a stable curve of genus g, as g > oo. Our approach fails to directly
yield an answer. In particular, we would seek a computation along the lines of lemma 4.1, but this
is complicated by the fact that the dimensions of the tautological cohomology R’ (Mg,n) can grow
exponentially in g, as g > 00.

In §2, we review the topological results showing that the low degree singular cohomology of
Mg,» is tautological and giving a precise description of the cohomology groups. In §3, we translate
these results into compactly supported étale cohomology using comparison isomorphisms and
determine the effect of Frobenius. In §4, we prove theorem 1.3. In §5, we prove theorem 1.4. In §6,
we outline some thoughts and questions about how a random matrix model might give evidence
for or against conjecture 1.1.
