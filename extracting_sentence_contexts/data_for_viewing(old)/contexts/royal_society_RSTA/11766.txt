(2.) The line-integral of the electric force taken once round any closed circuit fixed
in space is equal to minus the total amount of magnetic current through the circuit,
the positive directions of the magnetic current and of the integration being related
as in (1).

There is no evidence for the existence of a magnetic conduction current, involving
a waste of energy. The only constituent of the magnetic current is that which arises

from the increase in the magnetic induction; viz., re or p + when p is constant.

We might include a fictitious magnetic convection current 7u when 7 is the volume
density of magnetism, but for the present we omit it. The relation may thus be
expressed by

Equations (4) and (5) must be satisfied at all points of the field. They at once

taken we have
