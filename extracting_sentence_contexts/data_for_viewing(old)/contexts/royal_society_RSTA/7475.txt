period varies roughly as sin y, and that for y = 90° the period would be 2-25(-+-0-05) x 1077.
From the temperature variation of amplitude, the value of the effective # was deduced as

f=5:9x10-%, so that = = a = 0°3,

and from the period we find

E, = 29x10-*erg, 7, =2100°K.

The amplitudes were again rather small and, as can be seen from table 7, do not always have
the same values for +y as crystal symmetry would demand; this is probably because the
amplitudes are very sensitive to the exact orientation of the crystal. The amplitudes were in
fact considerably modified when the tetragonal axis and a binary axis* were set more nearly
horizontal and vertical respectively after the first experiment in which they were 15 and 12°
off these directions respectively. Verkin e¢ al. find the effect for small rather than large

values of y/, but since their periods for y = 8-5 and 18:5° agree well with the periods obtained
in this work for the complementary angles, it is likely that either in the present work or in
theirs the tetragonal axis has been wrongly identified. This interpretation is confirmed by
the fact that opposite signs are found for the steady anisotropy (see table 11), and since the
