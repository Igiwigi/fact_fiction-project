dentary. In mammals the masseter is typically inserted on the outer face of the
posterior angle of the dentary, the temporal on the coronoid process. A certain
morphologically anterior migration of the insertion is indicated.

Change in attitude of the pterygoid and ectopterygoid

If these suggestions are approximately correct, then the small size of the pterygoid
elements in mammals is probably correlated with their functional obsolescence. Their
reduction may be expected to have taken place with the reduction of the reptilian
pterygoideus muscle when the post-dentary bones lost their share of the jaw articula-
tion and were transformed into auditory ossicles. From this point of view the great
median beam formed by the Cynodont pterygoids is a structural necessity because
of the nature of the pterygoideus musculature (Arpt), and the fact that the greatly
reduced pterygoids in mammals do not normally meet in the mid-line readily becomes
intelligible. The remnants of the pterygoids, however, have a new importance in
forming the side walls of the nasopharyngeal ducts.

The stages by which the laterally extended Theriodont pterygoids were transformed
into the typical “mammalian” condition are unknown in any fossil forms, but the
Ictidosauria had apparently attained the mammalian condition. The functional aspect
