include the parietal lobule and the part of the marginal gyrus corresponding in
longitudinal extent to the lesion upov the external surface.

Result.—Absolute hemiplegia, as in 16, but of course involving the opposite side of
the body. The hemiplegia was absolute, although the parietal lobule and the upper
two-thirds of the ascending parietal were not removed, at least intentionally. But
there was a partial softening and undermining in these convolutions, probably
produced by the interference with their vascular supply which was caused by the

lesion, and sufficient to account for the fact that the paralysis extended to the parts
with which the conyolutions in question are connected.

This animal also lived one week only.

The superficial extent of the lesion is represented in fig. 17, Plate 2.

18.

Lesion 1.—Excision of the posterior three-fourths of the left marginal gyrus. A
small part of the lower edge of the convolution was, however, left, as the section of
the brain shows (fig. 18).
