On snspending a fragment of fusible calculus, by means of horse-hair, in a test-
glass containing the fluid, it became at once involved in a white cloud, from which
a continuous stream of precipitate gravitated to the hottom of the glass. After the
lapse of half an hour the calculus was found to have lost weight. This was an import-
ant fact, without which it might have been supposed that decomposition of the s0Ju-
tion alone had given rise to the precipitate. Being inclined to doubt the evidence of my senses, rather than arrive at a false
conelusion, I repeated the experiment. Another particle of triple phosphate was
placed in a fresh quantity of the liquid ; at the moment of immersion chemical action
commenced, and pursned the same course, until the fragment became a semi-solid
mass, readily disintegrated.
