Reduce the momentum, and you not
only impair those functions, but, if the reduction go to a cer-
tain degree, you bring on syncope, in which they are for a
time suspended. On the other hand, in nervous affections,
the sensibility and other functions of the brain are unduly in-
creased ; and what can be more natural than to attribute this
effect to the contrary cause, or excessive momentum in the
vessels of the brain ? If, however, this analogical reasoning
has any force in ascertaining the principle, I must acknow-
ledge that it did not occur to me till twenty years afterwards,
when a great number of direct experiments had appeared to
me clearly to demonstrate the fact. From various cases of this kind, I beg leave to select one
which occurred to me in the month of January, 180g.

ness of breathing, affecting her only when she used strong
muscular exertion, as in walking up stairs, or up hill.
