* There is a similar relation between S and 7’ in the toad’s heart, 7’ being upright whenever S is

prominent and 7' being inverted when S is absent. Evidently these facts may help us to recognise the
meaning of 7 and its inversion.

of obtaining, as an accompaniment of a series of direct surface readings, standard
curves of constant outline, for it is evident to me that any change in the form of the
standard curve is accompanied by a change in surface distribution. Observations
which bear out this statement deserve illustration, for the fact is of consequence. It

will, however, be convenient to deal with this matter more fully at a later stage.
