p's, = Bye" G (2r + 2, 2v)/G (7, v),
po = Fy e-” G (37 + 4, 3v)/G (7, v).
These results together with

ae a (72 + v*)
By = (7 —1)’

a= yae*" G (rr, v),
are theoretically sufficient to determine the four constants 7, », yy and a. Practically
they would hardly be of service without very elaborate tables of the G functions.

As a matter of fact, we are very unlikely in dealing with actual statistics to meet
with cases in which pg and p, become infinite, because neither the range of observa-
tions, nor the size of the groups observed at great distances from the origin can be
infinite, With finite values of py and py it is, however, easy to see that we always
obtain from our solution on page 877 a value of 7>3, so that the solution is self-
consistent,
