= peosy +n (5° cos a + 38 cos B+ 300s 7) + (08 + 2 cos B+ % cosy) = — pgf cos y. These equations express the fact that the surface-tractions at the mean surface are
equivalent to a normal stress equal to the weight of the harmonic inequality,
and they might have been written down at once from this consideration. 1t has,
however, been thought preferable to verify them at length ; it will be seen that the
shorter procedure is only justifiable in the case where the material is initially in
a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. If in the zero configuration this condition is not
satisfied the form of the boundary equations will be much more complicated.
