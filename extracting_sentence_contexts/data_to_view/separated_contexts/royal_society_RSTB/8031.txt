Jaworski (1926a, p. 219), in his monograph
on the South American Bajocian, and Dorn (1935, p. 23), dealing with the German. It was
unfortunate, for Buckman soon afterwards (18934, p. 483) subdivided the ‘Concavum
Zone’, recognizing a Concavum Zone proper below, and a Discites Zone above. Most if
not all of the Sonniniae called ‘Concavum Zone’ in his monograph, pls. lvii—ciii, are from

the horizon ascribed to ‘ Discites hemera’ on p. 447 (1894) and pl. xxiv of the supplement
(published 1g05) and so called in his later papers and Richardson’s.* The ‘ Discites Zone’
is in fact part of the Sowerbyi Zone of Oppel, of which it is at best a subzone. Buckman
(1891 a, 1910, p. 78) considered that ‘true Sonniniae’, i.e. the involute, high-whorled, high-
keeled group to which the genotype, S. propinquans (Bayle), belongs, were to be found only
in the Sauzei Zone, whereas the classic Sonninia fauna of Gingen, Wiirttemberg, described
by Waagen, occupied an intermediate position, for which he coined the ‘hemera Shir-
buirniae’. Instead of Oppel’s Sowerbyi Zone, Buckman therefore introduced four horizons
(subzones) :

(Top)

Witchellia spp. (1893 a, following Munier-Chalmas, 1892)
Shirbuirnia trigonalis (1910) (formerly Sonninia spp.)
Hyperlioceras discites (1893 a) and ‘post-discites’ (1910)

These divisions were adopted in all Richardson’s papers on the Inferior Oolite and in my
Jurassic System in Great Britain (1933), as best expressing the detailed stratigraphy in Dorset
and Somerset.
