the full spectrum of their functions.

Another very important observation from Wilkins is that ‘the
distinction between GSD and ESD systems is not always absol-
ute. Systems that are essentially ESD systems can possess a
degree of genetic determinism while in a few GSD systems,
variant populations with some degree of environmental deter-
minism can arise’ [9, p. 72]. In vertebrates, several examples of
GSD species with a well-known sex chromosomal system and
sex-determining gene that are still able to respond to environ-
mental factors have been studied. In fish, especially teleost,
this feature is more frequently observed, mainly due to the
fact that most species are oviparous and the embryos are
easily exposed to environmental cues during the critical sex-
determining time window [47]. Cultivation of eggs at high
temperatures leads to female-to-male sex reversal in GSD
species with robust sex-determining genes, such as medaka (a) Dmrt1
(O. latipes) [48], tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) [49] and pejerrey
(Odontesthes bonariensis) [50]. Experiments showed that temp-
erature increases the cortisol levels in the embryos in several
fish species, and, in medaka, it was suggested that cortisol
could directly activate the promoter of dmrtla in XX animals
during the sex-determination period, activating the male
cascade [51-54].
