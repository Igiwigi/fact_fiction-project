The experimental errors of these comparisons are of the order of 5 parts per million,
and it was not considered advisable to attempt to correct any of the calculated
values on the basis of the results. "They do, however, show that the uncertainty of
the calculated values probably does not exceed 1 x 10~°, which is therefore our
estimate of the maximum probable error of section (a) of the work.

With regard to section (6), we have shown that the average deviation of the
values given by the 23 determinations from the final result is only 3 parts per million,
and this in spite of the fact that some of the measurements were made with different
frequencies, different values of resistance, and different arrangements of the circuit.
Moreover, all the readings required could be taken with an accuracy of 1 part in 10°.
We have given reasons for believing that the systematic errors are eliminated by
taking the mean ofa group of cight readings obtained by reversing in turn the various
components of the network. The only remaining errors requiring consideration are
those arising from uncertainties in the small correcting terms. These only amount
to 20 x 10°° or less, and they can all be determined with an accuracy of 10 per
cent. or better. We therefore estimate the probable error of the purely electrical
measurements as + 5 x 10°°.

The total estimated uncertainty of our absolute measurement of resistance therefore
amounts to -- 15 x 107°, and we write
