But
when a double or interrupted conductor is uſed, the ſe-
cond conductor receives no electricity till the prime con-
ductor is pretty highly charged, and, if put at the greateſt
ſtriking diſtance, not till it is fully charged, and conſe-
quently the ſharp point preſented to the oppoſite end can
carry away none of it till that time; when the wholequan-
tity is thrown off at once, Itſhould ſeem then;that theex-
ploſion in onecaſe, and the non-explofion in theother, de-
pended wholly upon the different quantities to be thrown
off: whence it will follow, that though a ſmall quantity
of electricity will paſs off ſilently upon a point, yet that
this power is very limited; for that if a fomewhat greater
quantity be applied ſuddenly to a ſharp point, it will not
paſs off filently, but create an exploſion 3 In wn to
its denſity. The facts above related are a ſufficient anſwer to that
other experiment of Mr. NA1RNEY, in” which he exhi-
bited a ſharp point, that when perfectly communicating
with the earth drew off the eledricity ſilently from the
prime condu@or; but received exploſions freely, when
the communication was broken by interpofing little
iſthmuſes of ſealing wax, This experiment, it is true,

demon=-


from the Report of the Committee, 8c. 805
demonſtrates that a broken communication will occaſion
| the ſharp point to reccive an exploſion; and fo far it muſt
be owned to be condlufive. But if it was intended to ſug-

- geſt, that whenever ſharp points do receive an exploſion,
it is owing to this circumſtance, and, conſequently, that
<Mr. wILSON' experiments at the Pantheon were unfairly
Sade; in this view it has no weight, becauſe we have
Salready ſeen that an interrupted communication is not
#the only circumſtance that will produce an exploſion, for
that increaſing the quantity of eleQricity will have the

I ſame effect.
