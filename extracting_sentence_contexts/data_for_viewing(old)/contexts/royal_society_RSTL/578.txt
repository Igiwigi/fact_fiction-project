purpose of preparing the phosphorus bottles ; and the propensity
to vitriolization, observed in many of the half-roasted sulphureous
ores, appears to me to arise from this cause, rather than from
the mere diminution of the original proportion of sulphur, or the
actual immediate conversion of part of it into sulphuric acid ;
nevertheless, I offer this opinion, at present, only as a probable
conjecture, which may be investigated by future experiments
and observations.

The magnetical properties of the sulphuret of iron which
forms the principal subject of this Paper, must be regarded as a
remarkable fact; for I have not found, in the various publica-
tions on magnetism which I have had the means of consulting,
even the most remote hint, that iron when combined with
sulphur, is possessed of the power of receiving and retaining the
magnetic fluid; and, judging by the properties of common
pyrites, we might have supposed that sulphur annihilated this
power in iron, as indeed seems to: have been the opinion of
mineralogists, who have never enumerated magnetical attrac-
tion amongst the physical properties of those bodies ; and,
although WERNER, WIDENMANN, EMMERLING, and BROCHANT,
have arranged the magnetical pyrites with the sulphurets of
iron, yet the magnetical property could not with. certainty be
stated as inherent in the sulphuret, for, at that time, this sub-
