As a third-
generation synchrotron source, the magnetic lattice was
designed primarily around its suite of insertion devices
which were the flagship X-ray sources for the facility. The
bending magnets were simply there to steer the electron
beam around the storage ring. However, the radiation
from these bending magnet sources was, in fact, superior
in terms of brightness and brilliance to that of most
European national machines of the time, including the
UK’s SRS facility at Daresbury Laboratory. Thus, given
the relatively large floor area of the ESRF ring the idea
arose to make the bending magnet ports available to
