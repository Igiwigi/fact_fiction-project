«that the stamens also are in their nature simply leaves. In one word,

sing. Gorrurt (1790) at the outset drew attention to the fact that certain
or parts of plants sometimes “change and pass into the form of adjacent parts
wholly or in greater or less degree.” Of this change or “ metamorphosis ” he
nishes three kinds, regular, irregular, and occasional; the third, since it

3s in an annual plant serve as an illustration. As irregular or retrogressive
orphosis he designated such cases as the petaloid development of stamens,
