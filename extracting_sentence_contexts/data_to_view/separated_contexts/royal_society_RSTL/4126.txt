The experiment was
then repeated, continuing the ignition for a longer time, but the gas could not be in-
creased beyond a very limited quantity ; indeed it was not to have been expected, as
8upposing it to be mixed gas, recombination of the excess would haye taken place,

will donbtless surprise those who hear it for the first time. The experiment was repeated as at firs and the bubble transferred to another
tube; the wire was then again ignited in vapour, another bubble was instantly formed
and transferred, and 80 on, until after about ten hours' work sufficient gas was col-
lected for analysis ; this gas was now placed in an eudiometer, it detonated and con-
tracted to 0-35 of its original volume ; the residue being nitrogen. The experiment
was repeated several times with the same general results, the residue sometimes con-
taining a trace of oxygen.
