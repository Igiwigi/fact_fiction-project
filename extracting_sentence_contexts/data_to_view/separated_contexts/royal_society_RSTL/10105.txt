CARPENTER ON ORBITOLITES TENUISSIMA.

sub-segments (formed by the division of the principal segments) at every new stage
of gemmation ; 80 thab ab lasb the ale of the spire, extending themselves on either
gide round the nuclear mass, meet and complete the circlet, around which new zones
are then successively budded forth, as in the forms that are cyclical from their com-
mencement,

I did not at that time feel justified in calling in question the validity of the order
Cyclost2gues, which had been instituted by M. D'OrBravy, for the reception of this
and other types characterised by the cyclical plan of growth ; but in my Second
Series (presented in the following year), which contained the regults of a similar
investigation of the genus Orbiculina, I showed that the latter always begins life on
the spiral plan of growth, which may or may not give place 8ubsequently to the
cyclical, and that the marginal portions of a full-grown cyclical Orbiculina cannot
he distinguished from similar portions of an Orbitolite. From this fact I drew
the conclusion*® that although Orbitolites and Orbieulina had been placed by
M. D'Ormi6xy in two distinct orders, Cyclost2gues, and Helicost2gues, © the relation-
ship between them musb be extremely close ;” and ventured further to affirm that
no Classification can have any claim to be considered as natural, in which they shall
be widely separated.”

To this point I reverted in the Concluding Summary appended to my Fourth
Memoir, in which I showed how completely the results of my researches were opposed
to the principles on which the Classification of M. D'OrBicny had been framed,
indicated the line of © descent with modification ” by which a division of the
primary 8egments that form the simply-chambered shell of a Peneroplis into 8ub-
segments would give origin to the chamberlets of the spiral Orbiculina, and pointed
out how gradational the transition is from the latter to the cyclical Orbitolites.
