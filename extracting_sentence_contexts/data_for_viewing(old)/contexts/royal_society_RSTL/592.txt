lac may be found of much utility ; for, like mucilage, they may
be diluted with water, and yet, when dry, are little if at all
affected by it.*

We find, from the experiments on lac, that this substance is
soluble in the alkalis, and in some of the acids. But this fact
(considering that resin is the principal ingredient of lac) is in
opposition to the generally received opinion of chemists, namely,
that acids and alkalis do not act upon resinous bodies. Some
experiments, however, which I have made on various resins,
gum-resins, and balsams, fully establish, that these substances
are powerfully acted upon by the alkalis, and by some of the
acids, s0 as to be completely dissolved, and rendered soluble in
water.

It will be a very wide and curious field of inquiry, to discover
what changes are thus produced in these bodies, especially by
nitric acid. Each substance must form the subject of a separate
