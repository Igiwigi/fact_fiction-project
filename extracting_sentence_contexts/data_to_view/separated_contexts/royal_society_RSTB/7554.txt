This term
was applied to the remarkably well-synchronized change of course by members of dense
swarms, from up-wind to down-wind in gusts and back to up-wind in lulls. Its effect
seemed to be to impose â€˜due down-wind courses on locusts which, when less dense, merely
turned from up-wind to some across-wind course when hit by a gust. Gregarious reversal
seemed to depend on the fact that locusts losing headway or turning aside from their up-
wind course began at once to drop backwards relative to their fellows still making headway
into wind, thus stimulating the latter to turn down-wind after them until all were flying in
parallel down-wind. The differences between the tracks of neighbouring fliers, which are here assumed to be
the starting point for gregarious reversal in gusts, could come about in at least two ways. First, it may be assumed that individuals differ in respect of the timing and strength of the
responses governing their air speed and course.
