and late I, stages make it probable either that determination takes place at about the
middle of the I, stage, or else, if it takes place earlier than this, that during the I, stage
it gradually becomes less easily reversible (see sections 7 and 11).

On the theory here adopted, a leaf is determined as soon as a space covering a certain
minimum are of the apex becomes far enough below the growing-point. This minimum
arc we have estimated provisionally at 124°. But in some experiments spaces of more
than this minimum are were provided for certain primordia—for instance for I, in the
experiments in which only I,k arose. The question therefore arises whether in such
circumstances a primordium is determined over the whole of the available arc, as soon
as it becomes far enough below the growing-point, or whether it is first determined over
the minimum arc only, so that it can only occupy the rest by subsequent extension.
The second alternative is favoured by the facts concerning I, discussed on pp. 378, 379,
though more evidence is needed.

In the normal plant the leaves continue to extend laterally for several plastochrons
after they have arisen, as was shown in section 2, and by the beginning of the P, stage
they have already considerably exceeded the minimum arc of 124°. But the later
stages of this extension must take place through tissues that become available only
after the leaf has been determined, through the growth in length of the apex and axis,
which makes new tissue available above and between the older leaves.

There remain to be mentioned some minor points concerning the origin of united
leaves. It was found that the ares of the united halves of these leaves were never so
great as 62°, the estimated value of half the minimum arc of a primordium. This
