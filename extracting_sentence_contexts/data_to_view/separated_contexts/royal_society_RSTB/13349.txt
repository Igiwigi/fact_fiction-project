The details of this story are fleshed out
later in this section. By contrast, the five language families
that exhibit the higher prevalence of obligatory TAM mark-
ing—Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Nuclear Trans New
Guinea, Pama-Nyungan and Otomanguean—all come from
different parts of the world; with the exception of Indo-Euro-
pean and Afro-Asiatic, they are not in contact with one
another. Thus, the higher prevalence of obligatory TAM
marking in these five large language families may be con-
sidered to represent four or five independent facts. All this
suggests that the examination of individual language families
needs to be conducted within an areal perspective. Table 3 presents the distribution of obligatory and optional
TAM marking in accordance with a partitioning of the world
into eight areas, shown in the first column.
