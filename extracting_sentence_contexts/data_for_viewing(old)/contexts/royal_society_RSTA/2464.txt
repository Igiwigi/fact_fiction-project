in the mobile unit utilization, which ranges between 60% (at 540 Mbps), and 100% (at the highest
considered workload demand, 1500 MIPS).

The task allocation behaviour with the increase in demands in the other three scenarios in
figure 12b-d follows the same behaviours described in figure 12a taking into account the fact that
the varied link capacity and updated wavelength efficiencies affect the task allocation decision.
For example, in scenario 1 in figure 12b, the power efficiency of the green wavelength has the best
values, followed by blue, yellow, and finally red wavelength. This is reflected in the assignment
decision and therefore giving the mobile units allocated a green wavelength priority when it
comes to the processing allocation. The same observation is seen in scenario 2, where processing
is allocated first to the yellow wavelength followed by the red wavelength. It is worth mentioning
that no mobile units were allocated blue or green wavelengths in scenario 2, and all mobile
units in scenario 3 were allocated the red wavelength. This explains the zero utilization for these
wavelengths, in figure 12c,d.
