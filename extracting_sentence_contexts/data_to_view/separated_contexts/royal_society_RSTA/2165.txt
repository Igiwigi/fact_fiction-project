The preceding two propositions concern single elements of SO(4) or so(4). There is
a related result for subgroups of SO(4): any compact abelian subgroup is conjugate to a subgroup
of SOxy x SOz. This is a consequence of the Torus theorem for Lie groups [23], and the fact that
SOxy x SOz is a maximal torus in SO(4) [24]. Because of the properties just stated, many questions about SO(4) symmetries can be reduced
to questions about symmetries with respect to SO(2)xy x SO(2)zw. With the exception of ยง4b,
throughout the paper we consider the symmetries associated with this group, which we call the
double planar rotation group.
