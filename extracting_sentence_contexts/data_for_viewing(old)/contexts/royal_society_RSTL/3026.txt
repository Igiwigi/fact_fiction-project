is five feet in height, like our mummy, and the relative ad-
measurements of the arm, fore-arm, and hand in each, are

instance, can be farther removed from the symmetrical form,
and from the dimensions' of the pelvis in the Caucasian 'or
European race, than the same. part in the Negro or Ethi-
opian race. | Of this fact, I shall be able to convince such of
the Fellows of this Society, as are not conversant in these
matters, by exhibiting the most perfect pelvis of a well grown
Negro girl, which I prepared some years ago, in contrast
with that of our mummy, which I likewise carefully dissected,

In illustration of this remark, I made the following mea-
