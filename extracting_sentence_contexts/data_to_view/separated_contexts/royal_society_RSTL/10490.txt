"living sponge. Professor T. RuperT Joxgs * maintains the view that the silica of

chert generally is derived directly from sea-water, and similar opinions as to the origin
'of the cherb bands in the upper carboniferous limestones of Ireland have been put
forward by Messrs. HULL and Harpwant and by M. Rexarp þ with respect to the
phthanites in rocks of the same age in Belgium. Tt is a 8ignificant fact, however, in connexion with the chert-beds of the Irish
upper carboniferous strata that some bave been discovered filled with sponge-spicules
like the chert of the English greensand, and this indicates a similar origin for the
silica, and negatives the supposition of Professor HULL that it was deposited © from

< warm shallow water charged with silica in solution, in which chemical reactions would
Sbe at once set up, favoured and promoted by tidal and other currents.” Aa
