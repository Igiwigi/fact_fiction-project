There are not sufficient data from which to make estimates of the length of the
stages. There was extremely little difference between the pupz, sisal the results agree well
with those of other transference experiments, for it is probable that the pupal colour
was in both (a) and (8) largely influenced by the fact that Stage II. had been passed
(at any rate in part) upon surroundings which, in each case, tended in a different
direction from the environment to which the pupze were exposed in Stage IIT. Thus 15 pupze were obtained in this series. LEPIDOPTEROUS PUPA!
