There was much free oxymuriatic
acid in the positively electrified tube, but no particle of
muriatic acid had passed into the negative tube, either from
the muriatic solution or from the muscular fibre.

VI. Some general Observations on these Phenomena, and on the
Mode of Decomposition and Transition. It will be a general expression of the facts that have been
detailed, relating to the changes and transitions by electricity,
in common philosophical language, to say, that hydrogene,
the alkaline substances, the metals, and certain metallic oxides,
are attracted by negatively electrified metallic surfaces, and
repelled by positively electrified metallic surfaces ; and con-


chemical Agencies of Electricity. 29

trariwise, that oxygene‚Äù and acid substances are attracted by
positively electrified metallic surfaces, and repelled by nega-
tively electrified metallic surfaces; and these attractive and re-
pulsive forces are sufficiently energetic to destroy or suspend
the usual operation of elective affinity. It is very natural to suppose, that the repellent and attrac-
tive energies are communicated from one particle to another
particle of the same kind, s0 as to establish a conducting chain
in the fluid ; and that the locomotion takes place in conse-
quence; and that this is really the case seems to be shown by
many. facts.
