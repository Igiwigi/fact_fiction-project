It is also worthy of note that in this experiment
artificial respiration had a much more marked effect in maintaining the blood
pressure than in Experiment IV. with unheated venom. These facts confirm the
supposition that the venom of the Bungarus fasciatus contains a mixture of Viperine
and Colubrine poisons, the former being much more readily destroyed by heat, and
thus closely resembles the venom of the Pseudechis in its general characters. It
differs, however, from the last named in not having any powerful paralysing action
on the heart, for I found that even a solution of the strength of 1 in 50 produced
no effect on the beat of a frog’s heart to which it was directly applied, while
Martin (4) found Pseudechis venom to stop the frog’s heart in diastole when applied
in strong solution. As Lamp(5) has shown that Daboia venom in a weak solution is completely
destroyed by a temperature of 73-75° C. for } hour, while Cobra venom is little if
at all affected by such treatment, I treated some Bungarus fasciatus venom in this
way, and in Experiment VI. injected a cat under chloroform intravenously with the
same dose as in the previous cases (10 mg. per kilogramme), but at the end of
1 hour it had produced no effect on either the blood pressure or the respiratory rate.
