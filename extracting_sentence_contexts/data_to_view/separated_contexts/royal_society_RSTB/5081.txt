Moreover,
we can certainly perceive a yellow flower, or the yellow tints of the sky at sunrise,
neither of which contain a trace of green. Lastly, | have demonstrated that the fovea and the greater part of the macula region,
both im man and all the true monkeys, is of a pure canary-yellow colour. I discovered
this by examining the macula through the ophthalmoscope when illuminated by light
filtered through a pure spectrum-blue glass, a fact that has since been independently
rediscovered by Prof. Voart by the same method of experiment. Kine demon-
strated the same thing by the chrome-alum method as long ago as 1890.
