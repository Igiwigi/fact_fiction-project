For the purposes
of the proof (see [15, theorem 7.1.5]), orbital stability is the same as spectral stability plus it
requires in addition that the linearized operator L, (see proposition 2.4 below for a definition)
to satisfy Ker[L,] = span[VÂ¢.,m]. We do not verify here this property, sometimes referred to as
non-degeneracy of dw,m-

In the higher dimensional cases, the statement remains essentially unchanged, except with the
appropriate dependence of the index p on the dimension. The results here are new, but in fact
they follow along the ideas of the proof of theorem 1.1. Again, orbital stability will follow, once
one can establish the non-degeneracy of the waves. Theorem 1.2.
