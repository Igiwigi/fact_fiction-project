nation during cestrus, also can ovulate without coition. Such is the case with mares
and donkeys and cows (Harg, 1897, 1898),f with which artificial insemination is now
fairly widely practised. Artificial insemination has also been performed with suc-
cessful results on bitches (MiLiais, 1895 ; Heape, 1897, &c. ; see also note on p. 54),
and also on the human female (HEAPE, 1897, &c.), but not, so far as I am aware, upon
other Mammalia.

From my observations on ferrets, I have found that ovulation does not take place
without coition, and, unless the female ferret is warded at the right time for ovulation
to occur, the follicles and contained ova undergo atresia. But, notwithstanding the
ovulation being abortive, the cestrus persists until long after the time for ovulation
has gone by, so that a ferret, when warded too late in the season, fails to become
pregnant. This may be the explanation of the fact noted by Ropinson (1893) that
coition very frequently does not result in pregnancy, although the ferret may have
copulated more than once during cestrus. Thus the persistence of the cestrus which
continues far into the recuperation stage of the uterus, or beyond it, is associated
with numerous degenerating follicles in the ovary, which, in the natural condition,
would no doubt have discharged at an earlier period, under the influence of the
increased stimulus of coition. A female ferret which I inseminated artificially during
cestrus did not become pregnant, owing, probably, to the presence of the sperms in
the uterus without the act of coition failing to induce ovulation.

Tn many bats ovulation is described as occurring at quite a different time of the
year from cestrus, copulation generally taking place in autumn and ovulation in
spring (VAN BENEDEN and JuLin, 1880), there being sometimes as long as six months
