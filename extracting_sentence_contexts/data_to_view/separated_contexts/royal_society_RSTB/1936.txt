In the tissue beneath the ramenta and sporangia there is a group
of tracheides. The question arises whether any relation can be traced between the sporangia and
gxual organs. While a comparison of the abnormal archegonia described above and
fe imperfect sporangia suggests the possibility of the development of a sporangium

m an archegonium neck, the facts as yet observed do not permit of any satisfactory

@nclusion. The usual position of the imperfect sporangia would be diflicult to
s√©plain on any such view. S The two preceding species have been described in considerable detail, since some of
te departures from the normal which they present are of special interest.
