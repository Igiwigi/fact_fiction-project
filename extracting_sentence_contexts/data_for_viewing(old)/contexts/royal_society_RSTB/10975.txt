PAM (Walz), incorporate Oxborough & Baker's formula;
therefore, it is easy to monitor both levels of F’, in parallel.
Our new quenching procedure is based on the use of a
range of gradually increasing actinic light intensities, similar
to a light saturation curve procedure, but applied for longer
periods of illumination (5 min for each light intensity) with
short periods of darkness (10s) in order to assess qPq levels
by applying a saturating pulse (figure 2a,b). At lower actinic
light levels, F’,,. and F’, ,,,, are virtually identical, hence the
parameter qPq stays close to 1 (figure 1c). However, as the
light intensity becomes higher, F’, ,, starts to increase above
Fy, cae aNd gP4 becomes lower than 1. This discrepancy arises
from the fact that when RCIIs become closed due to photo-
damage, they stay closed in the dark, hence they cannot
photochemically quench fluorescence, causing an increase in
F., in a similar way to the increase in F’, caused by the
addition of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU)
or illumination, making this level effectively F,. Therefore,
under these conditions, F’, becomes appreciably less quenched
in relation to F),,, which is manifested in the observed devi-
ation of the experimental from the predicted F’, levels, and
hence brings the qP level down from 1. In parallel, the calcu-
lated values for ®pgy (formula (2.5)) at lower actinic light
intensities stay very close to the measured yield (figure 2c).
The measured psy begins to deviate from calculated values
