The carapace, including the rostrum, makes about one-third of the total length of the
body of the Lucifer Zo#a; about one-half of that of the Acetes Zota; and more than
two-thirds of the total length of the Sergestes Zota. The abdominal somites of the
Acetes Zota are shorter and wider than those of the Lucifer Zoza, and this change is
carried still further in the Sergestes Zota. In the Lucifer Zota the sixth abdominal
somite is the only one which has ventral spines, and these point backwards. All the
abdominal somites of Acetes have spines, and they point backwards and a little
outwards, while in Sergestes they all point directly outwards,

The telson is slightly notched in Lucifer ; deeply forked in Acetes; and in Sergestes
the prongs of the fork diverge 80 much as to form a right angle.

These facts are extremely interesting, as they geem to show that the Flaphocarts is a
larva exsentially like that of Zucifer, which has passed through a remarkable process
of secondary modification, resulting in the acceleration of the development of the
eyes, and the production of a forked telson, and a very 'spiny body. The larva of
Acetes has been modified in the same direction but to a much less degree. Tt may be
asked why we are to assuwme that the Lucifer Zota is the primitive form, and the
Hlaphocaris larva the s8econdary modification rather than the reverse ; but a little
thought will show that the distinctive features of the Elaphocaris stand in direct
relation to the environment, as weapons of defence, sense organs, or locomotor
apparatus, while the distinctive marks of the Lucifer Zota are features of general or
typical resemblance to the corresponding larva of Fuphausia and Penaus.

I did not 8ncceed in finding the Protozota from which the Zota shown in fig. 79 is
