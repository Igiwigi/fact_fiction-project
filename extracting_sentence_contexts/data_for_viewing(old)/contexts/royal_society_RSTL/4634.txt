Dr. Bzpposs' West Country Contributions, entitled, © Researches on Heat, Light
and Respiration,” in which he gave ample confirmation to the views of Count Rum-
rorp. By rubbing two pieces of ice against one another in the vacuum of an air-
pump, part of them was melted, although the temperature of the receiver was kept
below the freezing-point. This experiment was the more decisively in favour of the
doctrine of the immateriality of heat, inasmuch as the capacity of ice for heat is much
less than that of water. It was therefore with good reason that Davy drew the in-
ference that © the immediate cause of the phenomena of heat is motion, and the laws
of its communication are precisely the same as the laws of the communication of
motionÞ.”

'The researches of DuLoxG on the specific heat of elastic fluids were rewarded by
the discovery of the remarkable fact that * equal volumes of all the elastic fluids,
taken at the same temperature, and under the same pressure, being compressed or
dilated suddenly to the same fraction of their volume, disengage or absorb the same
absolute quantity of heat}.” "This law is of the utmost importance in the development
of the theory of heat, inasmuch as it proves that the calorific effect is, under certain
conditions, proportional to the force expended.

In 1834 Dr. Faravay demonstrated the © Identity of the Chemical and Electrical
Forces.” This law, along with others subsequently discovered by that great man,
showing the relations which subsist between magnetism, electricity and light, have
