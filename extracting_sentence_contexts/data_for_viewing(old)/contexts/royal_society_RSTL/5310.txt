In the Cephalopoda the contraction of the branchio-cardiac veins has been
observed by Mitxe-Epwarps and KGrukKeR, 80 that they may be considered to be
auricles. This is another curious illustration of the fact, that what is commonly
considered the most concentrated and highest organization does not occur in the
reputed highest forms of Mollusca.

The heart lies above the intestine, and gives off the aorta anteriorly. This
runs forwards through the cephalo-pedal ring with the cesophagus, and terminates
eventually in the buccal mass. Its main branches may be classed as visceral and
pedal.

It is needless to enter here upon the beautiful discoveries of M. MiLxNz-Epwarps,
with respect to the incompleteness of the circulation in the Mollusca. The facts I

to be observed, that in this respect, again, the © highest” Cephalopod, Octopus,

The consideration of the archetypal vascular system leads naturally to that of the
value of the distinetion made by M. MiLxe-Epwarps between opisthobranchiate and
prosobranchiate Mollusca. If my views be well-founded, it is clear that opistho-
branchism is the typical condition of all Mollusks, and that prosobranchism is one
