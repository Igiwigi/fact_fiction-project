months, a high value in the maximum for the subsequent pulse is in considerable
measure accidental, but even if accepted as a physical fact, it might have more than

that associated with the full choice of 5 days a month. Consequently, the amplitude
of the subsequent pulse increases with that of the primary pulse.
