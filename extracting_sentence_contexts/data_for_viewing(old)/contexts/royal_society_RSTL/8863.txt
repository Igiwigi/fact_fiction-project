In the best specimens a distinct bordering line can be seen, and it is, as a rule, possible
to state the characters by which the cells of the nerve-rudiments and yertebral bodies
differ. The more important of these are the following :—(1) 'The cells of the nerve-rudi-
» ment are distinctly smaller than those of the vertebral rudiment ; (2) the cells of the nerve-
rudiment are elongated, and have their long axis arranged parallel to the long axis of
S the nerye-rudiment, while the cells surrounding them are much more nearly circular.

The cells of the nerve-rudiment measure about +55 X 5355 to T3575 X 335 inch,
those of the vertebral rudiment 5555 X 7955 inch. The greater difficulty experienced

in distinguishing the nerve-rudiment from the connective-tissue in Pristinrus than in
Torpedo arises from the fact that the connective-tissue is much looser and less condensed
: in the latter than in the former.

'The connective-tissue cells which have grown out from the muscle-plates form a con-
tinuous arch over the dorsal surface of the neural tube (vide Plate 17. fig. F); and in
ome 8pecimens it is difficult to see whether the arch is formed by the rudiment of the
posterior root or by connective-tissue. Tt is, however, quite easy with the best speci-
mens to satisfy one's self that it is from the connective-tissue, and not the nerve-rudiment,
that the dorsal investment of the neural canal is derived.

As in the previous case, the upper ends of each pair of posterior nerve-rudiments are
quite separate from one another, and appear in sections to be united by a very narrow
root to the walls of the neural canal at the position indicated in fig. F*.
