If one examines more precisely the effect on the
dynamics of the system of departures from rigidity, it becomes
apparent that flexibility in a lateral direction is much more
serious than flexibility in a vertical direction. The full torque
of any gyroscopic system is only developed if the system is
restrained. Two features of the structure of the haltere suggest
that it is, in fact, much more resistant to lateral than to vertical
bending. These are (a) the oval section of the stalk, the major
axis of the oval being horizontal, and (b) the peculiar corruga-
tions of the dorsal and ventral scapal plates found in the higher ee
Diptera (see p. 362). F b

It is quite consistent with the working of the haltere as pyoyre sg, Longitudinal sec-
an alternating ‘restrained’ gyroscope that there should be tions through the dorsal scapal
considerable flexibility in the vertical plane.
