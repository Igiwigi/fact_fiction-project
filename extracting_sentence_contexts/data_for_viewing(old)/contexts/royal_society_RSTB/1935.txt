the motor nucleus of the fifth nerve, where it lies between this nucleus and the
superior olivary body and on the mesial side of the motor trigeminal root, whence it
may be followed into the posterior part of the lateral medullary region and onwards
into the lateral column of the spinal cord, as elsewhere detailed and figured (15,
Plate 67).

The observations ot Boycr (16) upon the descending internuncial fibres of the
mid and hind brain indicate the presence of a system of fibres in the lateral medullary
region and lateral column of the spinal cord which degenerate downwards after
section of the opposite crus cerebri, the crossing taking place through Foret’s
“fountain” decussation. That these fibres occupy in the position of our “lateral
fillet tract” is apparent from a comparison of the figures, but that they do not all
arise from the opposite crus cerebri is evident from the facts recorded in this and a
previous paper, which show that many come from the posterior quadrigeminal body
and the lateral fillet of the same side.

(e) Unilateral Destruction of the Internal Geniculate Body.

From an inspection of fig. 6, Plate 2, which represents the amount and extent of
lesion in these cases, it will be seen that the mesial fillet was also destroyed, as it
lies immediately subjacent to the internal geniculate ganglion in the tegmentum
eruris.

Hence the degenerations which we have observed result from destruction both of
the geniculate body and of the mesial fillet. The degenerations due to interruption
