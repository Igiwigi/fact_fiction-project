started. A timing device attached to the driving shaft of the whirling table caused
a contact to be made every tenth revolution of the rotating arm and to be registered
on a chronograph simultaneously with the beats of a seconds pendulum. An examina-
tion of the chronograph sheet showed that with the above precautions the speed
remained constant to about one-tenth of 1 per cent., well within the range of accuracy
of the present observations.

Section 10.
(i.) On the Constants of the Platinum Wires under Test.

The most difficult measurement in the present study of heat convection and that
which imposes a limit to the accuracy attainable is the calculation of the temperature
of the wire from the change of resistance. In fact this point confines the present
experiment to the use of platinum wires whose constants in the measurement of high
temperatures are well known. It must be kept in mind, however, that the constants
of a platinum wire which has been kept for some time at a high temperature for
a considerable time as in the present experiments are liable to change. This source of
uncertainty is aggravated in the case of very fine wires where the additional difficulty
of a sensible change of resistance due to “evaporation” from the wire is to be met
with.(*) Evidence on both these points will be noticed from an inspection of Table IL.,
and the limit of accuracy due to these and other difficulties may be roughly set at
4 of 1 per cent.

The wires employed in the present experiment were drawn through diamond dies(®)
from a length of 6 mil pure platinum wire whose constants when used in platinum
