Concluding remarks

The biosphere is literally dominated by viruses and other MGE. Emergence of parasites is an inherent property of replicator
systems. These two facts predicate the multiple and essential
roles of MGE in the evolution of life. Here, I identify specific
contributions of selfish elements to the major evolutionary
transitions. Such contributions come in two forms: the arms
race that triggers major innovations in cellular life forms
(hosts of the selfish elements) and direct recruitment of parts
of selfish elements for key cellular functions.
