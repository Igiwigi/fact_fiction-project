The maximum positive departure in the five-day smoothed curve is 0-16 and the
maximum negative departures — 0-28, giving a total difference of 0-44 which is
equivalent to a catch at no moon of approximately 275 when the full moon catch
is considered as 100. Discussion on the Asymmetry of the Lunar Effect

The final curve in fig. 2 is asymmetrical in two ways : (a) the negative departure
at the full moon period is shorter (11 days) and more extreme at its maximum
(— 0-28) than the positive departure at the no moon period which lasts for 17
days and has a maximum departure of + 0-16 ;

(b) the positive departure continues high for a number of days after no moon,
and the cross-over from positive to negative occurs only four days before full moon ;
while the reverse change takes place 7-8 days after full moon. The first asymmetry is almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the
light of the moon (due to the proportion of its surface illuminated) and the duration
of the moonlight through the night are both decreasing simultaneously as we pass
from full moon towards new moon; and at the first quarter not only has the
reflected light been reduced to about half, but the duration of its effect during the
night has also been reduced to half (on an average). This, with the reverse effect
between no moon and full moon, would tend to give the curve a flat top and a
narrower and more emphasized minimum. The second asymmetry appears to be due to the irregularity of the sequence of
the hours of setting and rising of the moon on successive days in the lunar month,
which has already been mentioned briefly.
