Consider the Ebola
virus disease (EVD) epidemic of West Africa in 2014-2016. In September 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) forecasted 1.4 million cases of EVD in Liberia and
Sierra Leone by 20 January 2015 [91]. In fact, by 20 January
2015, there were fewer than 20000 confirmed and suspected
cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone [92]. Importantly, the forecast
assumed that no changes in individual behaviours and
community health decisions would take place. Hewlett &
Amola [93] present evidence that Ebola-affected communi-
ties, in fact, typically adopt protective measures that change
the outcome of epidemics.
