shows tracings from a series of flash photographs in free flight of an Eristalis tenax whose
halteres had their end-knobs removed about two hours previously. The photographs were
taken by releasing the fly in front of a moving film camera in the beam of an ‘arditron’
lamp giving 2 usec. flashes 8 times per sec. In spite of the fact that the wings were beating
apparently normally, the fly was unstable in yaw and during the 1 sec. covered by the
photographs executed one complete turn about the vertical axis. The insect, in fact, fell
to the ground and was unable to maintain itself in the air.


MECHANISM OF THE HALTERES OF DIPTERA 379

Not all haltere-less flies launched into the air fall vertically to the ground. Some progress
for a short distance horizontally with an oscillating motion before losing control, and some-
times the spin is checked before the ground is reached, to be followed by a short period of
level flight before it starts again. Only when a powerful orienting stimulus such as a source
of light is present, do the flies make any progress in one direction. These experiments
confirm the hypothesis that it is in the yawing plane that the dipterous insect requires
reflex stabilisation.
