Philip Hallâ€™s alternative proof

Another proof of theorem (17-1) is given, which uses permutation groups instead of free
products with amalgamations, and which is due to Philip Hall (unpublished). We consider the regular permutation representation of a group K by right multiplications ;
if k*e K, let p(k*) denote the corresponding right multiplication, that is, the mapping
defined by kp(k*) = k.k*
for all elements ke K. If A is a subgroup of K, we denote by p(A) the group generated by the
right multiplications p(a) (and in fact consisting of these right multiplications) which belong
to the elements ae A. This group is isomorphic to A. Lemna.
