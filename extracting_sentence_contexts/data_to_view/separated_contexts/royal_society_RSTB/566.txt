§ ‘ Palwontology,’ 2nd edition, 1861, p. 263. AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE FOSSIL REPTLLIA. 217

The same author soon after published his ‘ Paleontology,’ which gives in the second
edition, in 1861, a summary of his researches on the Anomodontia,* with some new
facts and new views. Thus, it is observed of the Dicynodontia: ‘ The vertebrae, by the
hollowness of the co-adapted articular surfaces, indicate these Reptiles to have been
good swimmers, and probably to have habitually existed in water; but the construc-
tion of the bony passages of the nostrils proves that they must have come to the
surface to breathe air. The pelvis consists of a sacrum composed of five confluent
vertebrae, with very broad iliac bones, and thick and strong ischial and pubic bones.
