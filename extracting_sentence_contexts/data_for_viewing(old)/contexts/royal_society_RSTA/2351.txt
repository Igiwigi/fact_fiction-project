in the parameters governing the structural behaviour: material properties, geometry, boundary
conditions, etc. The level of uncertainty connected with these elements needs to be accounted for
to accurately assess both the structural safety and the confidence level of the results provided
by the analyses. In this respect, the availability of experimental results can provide significant
information to calibrate a numerical model of the structure to be employed subsequently to
perform seismic analyses [4,5].

In seismic codes, uncertainties involved in the seismic assessment of existing structures are
generally treated by simply introducing discrete knowledge levels and associating with each of
them a value of the so-called confidence factor. The latter is a reduction factor to be applied to
material strength and stiffness, and is supposed to account for all sources of uncertainty involved
in the assessment. Despite the simplicity of this approach, several drawbacks are associated with
it [6], one of which being the fact that it is unable to correctly account for the additional knowledge
that can be acquired by means of the new experimental data [7].

In recent decades, the Bayesian approach has been proven to be an effective theoretical
framework for dealing with different sources of uncertainty. The Bayes theorem is commonly
employed to derive a posterior probability distribution of a set of uncertain parameters according
to both their prior probability distribution (i.e. an initial knowledge about their possible range
of values) and the likelihood of the observed data. It allows us to encompass not only the
uncertainty quantification with respect to the values of a model parameter but also to account
for the acquired additional knowledge. An increased interest has been observed in the use of the
Bayesian framework, particularly with reference to the updating of a numerical model from the
results of different experimental tests performed on the structure.
