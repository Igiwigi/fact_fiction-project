where ¢ is a small parameter, reflecting the easyness of the easy mode of compression in the Dos
x,-direction, and the appearance of E = 4x w/(« + 2) reflects the fact that the effective Young’s : =
modulus for compression in the x2-direction is approximately the same as the pure elastic phase, : a
