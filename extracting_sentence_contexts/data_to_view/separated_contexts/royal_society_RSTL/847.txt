it was acted on by muriatic acid,
and partially dissolved; andthe solution precipitated gelatine
and the salts of iron. It afforded, by incineration, a-considerable
portion of lime, but no alkali. In comparing these facts, it would seem, that the precipitate
from infusion of galls, consists partly of tannin and gallic acid
united to a small quantity of alkali, and partly of these vegetable
matters combined with calcareous earth ; and it will appear pro-
bable, when the facts hereafter detailed are examined, that both
the potash and the lime are contained in these compounds in a
state of union with 'carbonic acid. The $olutions of carbonate of soda and of carbonate of

ammonia, both precipitated the infusion of galls in a manner
similar to the carbonate of potash ; and each of the precipitates,
when acted on by boiling water, left a small quantity of insoluble
matter, which seemed to consist chiefly of tannin and carbonate
of lime.
