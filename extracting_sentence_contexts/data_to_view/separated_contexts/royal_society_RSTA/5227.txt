Conclusion

In this paper, we have predicted the existence of different kinds of dissipative spatial solitons in a
semiconductor laser with saturable absorber where the field intensity displays strong oscillations
in time. When the carrier lifetimes in the amplifier and in the absorber are comparable, an
Andronov-Hopf instability of the stationary solitons leads to the appearance of what we called
passively Q-switched solitons, which present features very similar to those of passive Q-switching
extensively studied in the time domain. The fact that passive Q-switching is localized in space allows studying the interaction of
different oscillating solitons which coexist in the same laser. In a 2 x 2 array, we have shown
that in the long-term evolution the four solitons synchronize their intensity pulses and lock their
phases in such a way that two solitons in the same row or column have a phase difference of z,
whereas two solitons on the diagonal have the same phase. The four solitons also experience a
repulsive force which makes them move apart one from the other.
