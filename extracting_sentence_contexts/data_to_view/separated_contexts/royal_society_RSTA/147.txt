The linear stability of the laminar profile implies that the exact coherent
structures have to arise in finite-amplitude saddle-node bifurcations at some finite
distance from the laminar profile. A sufficiently large perturbation will hence be able
to trigger turbulence, but not all perturbations are equally effective. The studies of
Boberg & Brosa (1988) and Trefethen et al. (1993) have highlighted the fact that,
even when all eigenvalues of the linearized problem indicate decay, there can be
transient amplification and growth in energy owing to the non-normality of the
linearized operator. A link between these structures, their amplification and
nonlinear instabilities as seen in experiments on turbulent puffs is discussed by van
Doorne & Westerweel (2009). Theoretical approaches to extract perturbations that
are efficient in triggering turbulence are presented by Biau & Bottaro (2009) and
Cohen et al. (2009), respectively.
