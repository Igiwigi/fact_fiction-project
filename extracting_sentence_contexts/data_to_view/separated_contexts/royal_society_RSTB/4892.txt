It had been our intention to carry our researches on the circulatory system to the
point of ascertaining the proportion which existed between the amount of blood driven
round the body per minute, and the whole quantity of blood in the body. This

comparison involved measurements of the blood volume at the sea-level and at Cerro
de Pasco. Our object was frustrated by the fact that we obtained no constant proportion
between the minute-volume and the blood volume at the sea-level—a fact which, to
our surprise, was chiefly due to inconstancy in the mass of blood. As the changes in
the sea-level blood volume appear to be of considerable interest in themselves, we
give them in spite of the fact that their relation to altitude is uncertain. The most
that can be said is that they throw doubt on whether the effects attributed by other
authors to altitude are really due to that cause alone.
