ment renders anything of this sort very unlikely, and that we are bound to supp
the ether immediately outside moving matter to be stationary, i¢., to be 0
pletely unaffected by its motion, unless we are directly forced by facts to admit 1
contrary.

DR. OLIVER LODGE ON ABERRATION PROBLEMS. 735

The two parts of FresNet’s law, the motion of internal ether, and the fixity of
external ether, can and ought to be verified separately. The Fizeau experiment has
verified the one. I propose to attempt the other. To this end I am passing a beam
of light, split into two equal halves, very near a rapidly rotating disk (in fact between

mechanical motion and the other half travels against it. The two half beams, after
several journeys round and round, are united, with interference effects, and the
observation consists in watching the system of bands for any shift caused by the
motion. For description of this experiment see {§ 33-47 below.

Phenomena Resulting from Motion of Source, Receiver, or Medium.

9. The phenomena which can be appealed to as evidence of a state of motion, and
Q which necessarily result from that motion if of a suitable kind, are four, viz.:—

(1) Changes or apparent changes in direction of ray, as observed by telescope
