[14]. Also, the model is fair because the probability of winning is 50% for both agents, therefore
the expected gain is the same for each of them [14,16]. However, numerical [11,15] and analytical
[16-18] results obtained with the Yard-Sale rule (or variations thereof) confirm that the asymptotic
state of the model is condensation, i.e. all the wealth ends up in the hands of one or a very few
agents. The condensed state is an absorbing state where no more wealth is exchanged.

The formation of condensed and/ or stationary states and their properties have also been
deeply studied [19-22]. Different authors have analysed a variety of exchange models and their
steady state and establish criteria under which such steady states possess or not a Pareto tail. In
particular, they associate the presence or absence of tails in the final distributions with the trading


mechanism of the particular model, i.e. with the fact that binary trades are pointwise conservative, 3 |
or conservative in the mean. Some of the models studied are conservative, others not, and rules

do not guarantee a fair or efficient market, so they obtain regions of the parameters where the 3
system arrives to condensation and regions where condensation is not observed. oS

Restraining the scope to conservative and efficient (fair) exchange market models, different :3

tules of interaction have been applied to overcome condensation, for example, increasing the
probability of favouring the less wealthy agent in a transaction [11,12] or introducing a taxation
mechanism [23-26], where periodically all agents pay taxes, and the amount collected is shared
among a fraction or the totality of them.
