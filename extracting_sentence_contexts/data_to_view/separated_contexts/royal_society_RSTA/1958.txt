This analysis however does not rule out that the zero-mean oscillatory flow of viscoelastic
fluids with linear rheological constitutive equations may be unstable to infinitesimal
perturbations in the radial or the azimuthal direction, without the need of invoking nonlinear
theological laws. The corresponding linear stability analysis is however cumbersome in the
cylindrical geometry, because the base flow is given in terms of Bessel functions of complex
argument. The facts are that shear thinning of the WLM solutions is non-negligible at the flow
conditions at which instability is observed, so that the Giesekus equation is a better model of
their shear rheology than the UCM equation, and that the predictions of our perturbative analysis
based on the Giesekus equation for the instability threshold are in quite good agreement with the
experimental results.

5. Conclusion

Elasticity enables the propagation of shear waves in viscoelastic media. Stokes layers of linear
viscoelastic fluids characterized by the UCM and Oldroyd-B constitutive equations are governed
by three dimensionless numbers, El, Wi and De, accounting, respectively, for the ratio of elastic
to inertial forces, the dimensionless forcing amplitude and the dimensionless forcing frequency.
