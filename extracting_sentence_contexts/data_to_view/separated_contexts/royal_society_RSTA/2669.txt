The prominent Renaissance figure, Leonardo da Vinci, further observed that the tensile
strengths of nominally identical metal wires tended to decrease with the length of the wire [2]. Similar observations were made by Galileo Galilei, also more than 400 years ago [3]. It was
understood much later that these results are, in fact, manifestations of the extreme statistics of
failure [4,5]. Due to microscopic fluctuations in material properties, the most extreme defect in a
larger sample volume will tend to be more serious than any defect in a smaller sample volume, :
on average. The weaker pointâ€™s ability to nucleate failure earlier implies a lower strength of the =
larger sample.
