The two bundles k, & are assuming the oblique
relative positions seen in the similar bundles of the free petiole of 2. aspera, repre-
sented in fig, 2. Other sections in my cabinet, similar to fig. 1, demonstrate the
same facts, viz., that the pairs of bundles, fig. 1, d, which form so characteristic a
feature of transverse sections of the middle cortex of Lyginodendron Oldhamium, pass
outwards, through the outer cortex, to become the trachegal* bundles of the petioles
of the plant, and which petioles I had previously designated Rachiopteris aspera. I may
state that my friend Grar Soums-Lausacn, who has obtained numerous specimens
of the Lyginodendron associated with others of Rachiopteris aspera from a locality
on the continent, agrees with me in the conclusion at which I have arrived respecting
their unity.
