Effects of inhibiting somatosensory
cortices were comparable in many aspects to effects of inhibiting AI, both on
performance level as well as on EEG level as assessed by the HEP. These results
contradict the idea that a change in interoceptive processes might be due to side
effects of the TMS frontal stimulation site and therefore a general effect of affecting
attention or working memory circuits. We in contrast argue that the fact that
major results were comparable between stimulation sites aiming to inhibit AI
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0506. and somatosensory cortices is a strong empirical evidence that indeed nodes of

the interoceptive network were affected by TMS and that these effects were
specific for interoceptive processes and are not related to other main functions
