above and but slightly in advance of the posterior.

In Scorpenichthys the thyroid body lies between the anterior division of the pericardial
sinus and the ventral aorta, with its vesicles scattered, no doubt, as in other Teleosteans,
in the connective tissue around the ventral aorta and its branches.

From such a relation of parts it is a short and easy step to the invasion of the
connective tissue around the anterior division of the ventral pericardial sinus by
thyroid vesicles, and such an invasion might without hindrance gradually extend till
the whole surface of the sinus became more or less embedded in thryoid tissue and a
condition result similar to that actually present in Lophius.

From the facts at our disposal it seems, therefore, far more likely that the thyroid
body has grown round the thyroid lymph sinus than that the sinus has insinuated itself
into the substance of the thyroid.

(e) Microscopic Anatomy of Thyroid Body.â€”The vesicles of which the thyroid body
is composed show a very great variation in size, ranging from a diameter of some
0-8 mm. to a diameter of 0-05 mm. or less.

Those of small or moderate size are mostly of oval or globular shape, but the larger
ones often show an irregularity of form, appearing in surface view to be indented and
lobulated and presenting in section a branching stellate outline. The impression given
is that of a central chamber with bud-like prominences and recesses.
