As shown below, however, (4.8)
cannot be violated if a maximally connected coupling for the 1-2 system exists. It follows from
the fact that the statement of theorem 4.1 can be reversed: (4.4), (4.6) and (4.7) imply that D is
non-contextual. We establish this fact by first characterizing the distributions of R} and Rj for a
non-contextual 1-2 system (theorem 4.4 with corollary 4.5), and then showing that (4.8) always
holds for such distributions (theorem 4.6). Theorem 4.4. A maximally connected coupling for a 1-2 system is unique if it exists.
