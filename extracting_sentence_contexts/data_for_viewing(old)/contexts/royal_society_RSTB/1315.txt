3 Supradorsalia.—By this term I propose to distinguish a second system of paired
S cartilages, which are carried by the primary series, namely, by the basalia and inter-
§ basalia, and are genetically their separated-off distal portions, Their ventral
=’ counterparts are the ribs, as the free portions of the basiventralia. Supradorsalia are
%» in fact, the true representatives of ‘‘ Diapophyses” in Owxn’s arche-type vertebra,*
<a just as in reality the ribs are the “ Heemapophyses.” These supradorsals are
‘8 generally present as separate pieces, when basi- and inter-dorsalia do not meet above
the spinal cord, in which case the Supra-inter-dorsals fill the gaps and complete the
8 roofing-in of the spinal canal. Their position is always below the dorsal longitudinal
¢ ligament, which is so prominent in all cartilaginous fishes, less in the osseous Ganoids,
© vestigial in Teleostei.
z It is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of supradoyrsalia, in order to be
= absolutely correct when necessity requires their being mentioned.
