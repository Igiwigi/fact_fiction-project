Properly implemented, he states that it offers accurate leads in the investigations and is : g
compatible with constitutionally protected interests of both convicted offenders and their close 18
relatives.

More recently in [40] the lack of almost any recognition that DNA is unique yet partly shared
is discussed, pointing out that primary concerns over identity, security and privacy have masked
some deeper concerns over connectedness. Ram [40] says,

Courts, agencies, and legislatures have accepted that individuals have significant and
cognizable interests in their identifiable genetic information. Many individuals appear
similarly interested in protecting their identifiable genetic information from prying eyes.
But the rules that these institutions embrace are largely under inclusive because they fail
to take seriously the inconvenient fact that identifiable genetic information is involuntarily
and immutably shared with close genetic relatives.

In the future, there will likely be a number of similar challenges as novel digital assets and
digital personas of connected people may exhibit connected properties, either in their digital
behaviour, activities, opinions or in their attributes, beyond any hard data. Suppose that some
institution collects information on the behaviour of some digital asset (an account or an avatar,
online, say), from a largish population sample, together with the corresponding hard identity
and some hard attribute information of the individual (culture, race, beliefs, region, age, gender,
socio-economic group, etc.). The institution’s analytics team may discover relationships (logical
or merely correlations) between the digital behavioural attributes and the hard identity-based
attributes. Nobody’s behaviour (within digital space) is truly random: it would be very hard work
to be a totally random person. So the behavioural attributes constitute a non-random identity
