elements. And this remarkable agreement proves that the Irregularities as meagured
here are real objective facts. For they are measured from photographic sheets in which
the scales are very different: on the Westerly and Northerly records, 0:01 of Horizontal
Force is represented by 287 inches "and 2:55 inches, while on the Nadir record 0-01 of
Horizontal Force is represented by 0-88 inch. Yet the eye of the Reader of the Photo-
graphs has caught the Irregularities when shown on this s8mall scale as certainly as
when shown on the larger scale. With reference to their physical import, T think it
likely that the equality of Coefficients of Irregularity may hereafter proye to be one of
the most important of the facts of observation.

Second, the near agreement in the number of Irregularities for Westerly Force and
for Northerly Force. k

Third, the near agreement in the number of Irregularities for Nadir Force with half
the number of Irregularities for Westerly or for Northerly Force.

17. Ihave not succeeded in discoyering any clear relation between the times of occur-
rence of Irregularities of Westerly Force and of Northerly Force. They certainly do
not coincide. In their intermixture, I cannot assert that an Irregularity of one element
always occurs between two of the other element, though there is a general appearance
of that law.
