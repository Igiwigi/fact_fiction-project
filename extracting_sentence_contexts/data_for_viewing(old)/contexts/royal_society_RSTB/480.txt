The first faint indication of the dorsal pteryla is visible.

Stage F” (Plate 7, fig. 2).
The resemblance to Stage F (1, Plate 3, fig. 8) is very close, the chief differences

being the increased length of the beak and the greater distinctness of the feather-
tracts. The total length, from tip of beak to end of tail, is 70 mm.

The fore-limb (fig. 2) differs from that of F (1, Plate 3, fig. 9), in the fact that the
pollex is particularly well marked, having the form of a large, bluntly-pointed pro-
jection (1) on the pre-axial side of the manus. The fore-limb at this stage is a
thoroughly typical wing, closely resembling that of an embryo carinate bird of
Spencer's Stage T.

Stage G’.

This is the most important of the additional stages, since it serves to fill up the
very considerable gap between Stages G and H of my former paper.

The total length, from tip of beak to uropygium, is 130 mm. ; the head is nearly as
2 convex as in Stage G (1, Plate 3, fig. 10), but otherwise the form approaches more
