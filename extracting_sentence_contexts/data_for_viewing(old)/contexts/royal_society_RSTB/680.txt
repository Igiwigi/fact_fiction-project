S-becomes evident, though even then no fall in the E.M.F. of the current of rest occurs.
& It would appear then, that the skin of the Eel is remarkably resistant as regards
fatigue.
> Whether the continuation in the rise of E.M.F. throughout this experiment is in

‘Zin the E.M.F. of the rest current of the submaxillary gland noted by Bayziss and
= Braprorp after stimulation of the sympathetic, it is difficult to decide, for in this
Bease the E.M.F. of the current of rest was rising before the stimulation was com-
jomenced. I have attempted to convert a case of falling E.M.F. of current of rest into
Bone of rising E.M.F., by repeated excitation, but so far without success. Any attempt
Sto explain the continuation of increase of the negativity of the outer surface upon a
Ehypothesis of increase in alkalinity as a result of excitation is negatived by the fact
Bthat long faradisation of pieces of skin leads to the opposite effect, z.c., diminution of

alkalinity of the outer surface.

3 THERMIC STIMULATION.

ENGELMANN obtained a negative electrical variation upon the application of heat
a the skin of the Frog, using a platinum wire traversed by the current from two
a Grove’s cells, This is, as far as I am aware, the only case recorded of the effect of
