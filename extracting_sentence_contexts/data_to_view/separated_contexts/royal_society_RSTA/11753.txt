U1, 4065°22 (Plate 3). This is the only very strong line that is symmetrically
broadened. It preserves its character from 1 to 200 atmospheres.

(b) Unsymmetrical—unilateral.

In this class the broadening is unequal on the two sides, and it is obviously
intermediate between (a) and (b). Line r2 is very broad, and extends over 90 A.U.
at 40 atmospheres, the greater extension being towards the red.
