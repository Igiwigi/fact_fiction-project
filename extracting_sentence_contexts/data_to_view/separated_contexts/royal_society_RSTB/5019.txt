The pre- and post-zygapophyses


EVOLUTION AND ORIGIN OF AMPHIBIA, 229

are powerful, their articular faces having the normal direction and being inclined at
about 45Â° to the horizontal. The neural spine is of considerable height, laterally
compressed and long ; it rises from the roots of the zygapophyses. The whole neural
arch is in fact strikingly like that of the first dorsal vertebra of Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus. The sacral vertebra preserved in D.M.S.W. 29 differs from a dorsal in that the head
of the rib has an articulation on the centrum as well as on the intercentrum. The isolated and perhaps really indeterminable vertebral column D.M.S.W. 33,
agrees exactly, so far as it can be compared, with the scattered elements belonging
to the individual whose skull is D.M.8.W. 27, and its first sacral rib agrees closely with
an example associated with characteristic scutes on D.M.S.W. 32.
