The network over the whole apical half
of the ventricle is extremely dense and similar in its general constitution to that
found in the other ventricle. A sheet of interlacing strands passes deep to the
unattached portion of each papillary muscle ; the whole subendocardial space is
richly lined except for a small area immediately beneath the aortic valves on each
side of the main left division. It is most important for our purposes that the general and wide distribution of the
Purkinje system should be grasped, and that certain special features should be remem-
bered, for these features serve to explain some of the experimental facts presently
to be detailed. In particular we would emphasise the course and relation of the right
division to the chief papillary muscle of the right ventricle (see Plates 8-10, figs. 21, 22,
and 23);
