of the lungs, with different substances, 80 as to enable Mr.
Bavxr to expose and examine them on the field of the
microscope.

The first new fact discovered in the course of this enquiry
was, that although the common minute injection used by
anatomists for filling the blood vessels, when thrown in by
the trunk of the pulmonary artery, while the cells of the
lungs are empty, returns again by the trunks of the pulmo-
nary veins, yet when thrown in by the veins, it is not
returned by the trunks of the arteries.

Another fact was discovered ; that during the momentary
distention of the air cells, an interruption is produced between
the arterial and venal circulation in the lungs, the blood being
carried no farther than the small arterial branches surround-
ing the air cells.

The following description of the air cells, and the parts
surrounding them, is taken from the annexed microscopical
drawings of Mr. Bavxs.

As accurate representation surpasses all verbal description,
I shall not have occasion to do more, to make myself under-
stood, than to mention the parts themselves, and the circum-
