This agreement suggests that the PC is
strongly correlated with R (Spearmanâ€™s coefficient p = 0.84 and p = 0.72 for the UK and England,
respectively), and hence, PC may feasibly provide a viable additional quantity for fast nowcasting
of the pandemic.

4. Conclusion

Overall across nations, our results suggest that hospitalizations are consistently important as a
representative indicator of the state of the pandemic at any given time point, being highlighted
as outside the standard linear combinations of the other variables in most analyses. This matches
the fact that these are likely to be relatively unbiased compared with cases [14] and less age- or
health status-specific than MVBs. MVBs are also expected to be limited by capacity, unlike the
overall hospital admissions, the former of which policy has changed significantly over the course
of the pandemic [15]. The combination of results from S-mode and T-mode analyses at different
scales allow for a greater understanding of the pandemic at different levels.
