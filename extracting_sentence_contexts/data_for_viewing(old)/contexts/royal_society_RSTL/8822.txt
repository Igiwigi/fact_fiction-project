torn at this point, as often happens, and the continuity is therefore interrupted at F in
the figure.

All that lies below this point is situated, therefore, not in an open groove, but in a
closed space, roofed in and filled in by epithelium ; the significance of this fact only be-
comes fully apparent when taken in conjunction with what is observed in other creatures.

Below this point the epithelium is continued down in the interspace between the Jaw
and the thecal fold, and forms investing caps to each of the dentine-papille—attaining,
opposite to the youngest of the latter, a degree of development apparently in advance
of and almost disproportionate to the stage of evolution of the papilla.

Their homologies, and the degree of deyelopment which they attain, entitle these
epithelial caps to the name of © enamel-organs” *; and it was first pointed out by Pro-
fessor HUXLEY, in the paper to which I have already referred, that enamel-organs are
* nothing more than altered epithelium ” F.
