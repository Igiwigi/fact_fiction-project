required to justify the final acceptance of any of Mr. MaunpEr’s views, his paper is a
most important one.”

Several other criticisms of Mr. MAunprEr’s work were published at the time. One
which influenced me to some extent in undertaking the investigation now to be
described, was made by Prof. H. H. Turnert on behalf of Prof. Scuusrmr, in the
discussion of Mr. Maunpmr’s paper before the Royal Astronomical Society. Prof.
Scuuster apparently considered the data to raise a presumption, rather than afford a
demonstration, of the existence of @ period, and after applying his periodogram
methods he seemed to think there was more to be said for a 13°64 than a 27°28-day
period. As a final summary of his views it is stated (oe. cit., p. 84) —

“We have in fact a choice between two interpretations—

“1, Magnetic storms are apt to occur at times which, starting from a certain point,
are multiples of 13°64 days. During some years the odd multiples and during other
years the even intervals are principally concerned.

“2. Magnetic storms often recur after several successive intervals which are equal
to some lapse of time sufficiently near 27°28 days to fall within the limits of rotation
