E. T. HANSON ON THE SHADOW OF A STRAIGHT EDGE 59 The function F, is not, however, the complete solution, for we have still to satisfy
the conditions over the perfectly reflecting edge 6 = 0. We require, in fact, another
solution of equation (36). For this purpose write
F = Reosny,
so that R must satisfy the equation
