how well it can extrapolate beyond the training data to predict the statistical responses subjected
to various new time-dependent forcing functions and initial conditions.


Numerically, we examine the ML closure on a simple test model, the Lorenz â€™96 (L-96) system, 3 |
that was first introduced by Lorenz [26] as an idealization of atmospheric waves in midlatitude.

While the model is simple, it carries some properties of realistic turbulent complex systems 3
[27,28] such as the energy preserving advection-like nonlinear term, and a wide spectrum of oS

unstable modes through the nonlinear coupling between states. Beyond the simplicity, which
allows us to carry the numerical verification with moderate computational costs, our choice to
investigate this case is largely motivated by the fact that closure models for a coupled system of
the mean and covariance statistics have been well developed and improved in [4,9,28]. These
parametric closure models, developed based on clever physical intuition, have demonstrated
accurate statistical predictions. In such a configuration, we found that the ML-based model can
produce accurate statistical responses (comparable to the parametric model) on moderate to large
forcing amplitudes. Despite the effective prediction with parametric closure models in [9,28], the
cost of calibrating the statistical modes throughout the entire spectrum can become very high
as the dimensionality of the problem increases [5,10]. In addition to this practical problem, a
more fundamental issue with parametric modelling is that the design of accurate closure models
crucially depends on knowing the physics well enough, such as self-similarity or some structure
of the underlying dynamics. As an example that illustrates this issue, we will compare parametric
and ML closure models for only the mean statistics (no dynamical models for the variance are
involved) in the simple L-96 example. In this scenario, we find that the agnostic ML framework
