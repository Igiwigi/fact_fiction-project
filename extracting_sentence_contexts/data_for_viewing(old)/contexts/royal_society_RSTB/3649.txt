the whole, it is clear that the correspondence between the Forest of Dean and the
coalfields of Bristol and Radstock is much closer than with the South Wales.

It may perhaps be imagined that the present difficulties originate from the fact
that the horizons, as determined by the fossil plants, are not sufficiently accurate to
warrant a close comparison. Or it may be thought that the productive measures of
these coalfields all belong to one horizon, and that we are dealing with floras of local
distribution, and not with assemblages representing different stages in the evolution
of Carboniferous vegetation. It would be out of place here to attempt to justify the
existence of paleeobotanical horizons, or the validity of the large amount of work
which has been done, in recent years and in many lands, on the study of the vertical,
as well as the lateral, distribution of Carboniferous plants. As a reply, however, to
such a possible criticism, attention may be called to the fact that an essentially
similar problem, and one quite independent of the palobotanical evidence, is still
unsolved in the Midlands. â€˜This is the relationship of the Southern Midland to the
North Midland coalfields. The latter, comprising the basins of South Lancashire on
the West, and Yorkshire, with extensions into Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, on
the East, are now very well known, both geologically and palaobotanically. The
relationship of the one to the other, and of each to the Pennine uplift, is of the
simplest, so much so that the chief seams on either side of the axis can be correlated,
We find here Upper, Transition, Middle, and Lower Coal Measures, resting on true
Millstone Grits and, below these, Lower Carboniferous marine deposits.
