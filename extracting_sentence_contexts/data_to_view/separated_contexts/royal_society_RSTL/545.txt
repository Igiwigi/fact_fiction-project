The mechanical condition of both classes of doubly refracting
crystals, and the method of communicating to uncrystallized
bodies the optical properties of either class, have been dis-
tinctly ascertained, and the only phenomenon which remains
unaccounted for, is the division of the incident light into two
oppositely polarised pencils. How far this part of the $ub-
Ject will come within the pale of experimental inquiry, I do
not presume to determine ; but without wishing to damp that
ardour of research which has been so happily directed towards
this branch of optics, I fear that, as in the case of electrical
and magnetical polarity, we must remain satisfied with refer-

178 Dr. BREWSTER on the communication of double refraction, &c,

ring the polarisation of the two pencils to the operation of

some peculiar fluid, The new property of radiant heat which

enables it to communicate double refraction to a distant part

of a plate of glass, where the heat does not reside in a sensible

state ;—the existence of a moveable polarity in glass, whe-

ther the doubly refracting structure is communicated trans-

iently or permanently ;—and the appearance of regular cleay-

ages varying with the direction of the axes of double refrac-

tion, are facts which render it more than probable that a

peculiar fluid is the principal agent in producing all the phe»

nomena of crystallization and double refraction. " |
There is one fact, however, which forms a fine connection

between the aberration of the extraordinary ray and the prin- ;

ciples established in this Paper. It has been demonstrated by |

an eminent English, philosopher,* that every undulation must

assume a spheroidal form when propagated through a minutely

stratified substance, in which the density is greater in one

direction than another, and I have proved by experiment

that such a substance actually possesses the property of double

refraction. This singular coincidence will no doubt be re-

garded as an argument in fayour of the undulatory system.
