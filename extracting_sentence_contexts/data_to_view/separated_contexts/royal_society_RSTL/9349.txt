This
relation, within certain limits, between the intensity of a stimulus and the force of the

may often be observed under the influence of stimuli of v;

responding contraction, is, of course, to be observed more or less in the case of all
excitable tissnes ; but in the case of the excitable tissues of Aurelia the limits of
variation in this respect are extreme. As it will be necessary to discnss this 8ubject
at length in the next division of the present paper, ib will be gufficient in this place
merely to state the principal fact, viz. : that the excitable tigsnes of Aurelia admit of
giving either a very strong or a very weak response according to the intensity of the
stimulus in relation to the excitability of the tissxue. In view of this fact it occurred
to me that a valuable means was afforded of testing the hypothesis whereby I had
sought to explain the phenomena of artificial rhythm. For, if this hypothesis were ound,
we might expect that by employing single stimuli of uniform and slightly more than
minimal intensity, and by throwing them in at a rate slightly more rapid than is
required to produce a strong response to every stimulus, the strong responses would

alternate with weak responses. For after the occurrence of each strong response the

restoration of excitability (or recovery from exhaustion) must be a gradual process, 80
that if the stimulus is thrown in when this restoration has proceeded to a certain,
though nob to its full extent, the stimulus ought to be strong enough to evoke a feeble
response.
