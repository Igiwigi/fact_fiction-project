But I think IT have made
it clear that such a scheme will be most likely to approach the truth, when the basis of
it is laid in a thorough knowledge of the nature and extent of those variations which
every chief modification of this type shows itself s0 peculiarly disposed to exhibit, and
when, in building it up, the idea of natural affinity is accepted as expressing not only
degree of mutual conformity, but actual relationship arising from community of descent
more or less remote. For the occurrence of endless gradational departures from any
types which we may assume as fixed, and of links of connexion between such as present
the best-marked differentiations, seem to me to point unmistakeably to this as the only
means of escape from that difficulty of indefinite multiplication which attends the doc-
trine of distinct specific creations when applied to a group in which scarcely any two
individuals are alike. The case, in fact, is very analogous to that of the relationship
between the various members of the family of Mankind; for whilst the historical
evidence of actual change in them is s0 incomplete as well as s limited in its range, as
to be quite inadequate of itself to establish their community of descent, yet when that
evidence is considered in its relations to analogous facts drawn from the far greater
variations of domesticated animals, and to the manifold gradations by which the
extreme types are connected, physiologists of the highest eminence have felt themselves
Justified in accepting that community as probable. Now the modifications which any
single type of Foraminifera must have undergone, to give origin to the whole series of
diversified forms presented by that group, are not greater in comparison with those of
which we have direct evidence, than are those which the advocate for the Specific
Vnity of the Human Races has no hesitation in assuming as the probable account of
their present divergence,

to regard a large proportion of the existing Foraminifera as the direct lineal descend-
ants of those of very ancient geological periods ;—a doctrine first adyanced by Professor
EHRENBERG in regard to a considerable number of Cretaceous forms ; since fully con-
firmed and extended as regards the Tertiary fauna by the admirable researches of
Messrs.
