time, the existence of the ether, I have often struggled to perceive how far that medium
might account for or mingle in with such actions, generally ; and to what extent experi-
mental trials might be devised which, with their results and consequences, might contra-
dict, confirm, enlarge, or modify the idea we form of it, always with the hope that the
corrected or instructed idea would approach more and more to the truth of nature, and
in the fulness of time coincide with it.

The phenomena of light itself are, however, the best and closest tests at present of
the undulatory theory ; and if that theory is hereafter to extend to and include other
actions, the most effectual means of enabling it to do 80 will be to render its application
to its own special phenomena clear and sufficient. At present the most instructed persons
are, I suppose, very far from perceiving the full and close coincidence between all the
facts of light and the physical account of them which the theory supplies. If perfect, the
theory would be able to give a reason for every physical affection of light ; whilst it does
not do 80, the affections are in turn fitted to develope the theory, to extend and enlarge
it if true, or if in error to correct it or replace it by a better. Hence my plea for the
possIble utility of experiments and considerations such as those I am about to advance.

Light has a relation to the matter which it meets with in its course, and is affected
by it, being reflected, deflected, transmitted, refracted, absorbed, &c. by particles very
minute in their dimensions. The theory supposes the light to consist of undulations,
which, though they are in one sense continually progressive, are at the same time, as
regards the particles of the ether, to and fro transversely. The number of progressive
alternations or waves in an inch is considered as known, being from 37,600 to 99,880,
and the number which passes to the eye in a second of time is known also, being from
