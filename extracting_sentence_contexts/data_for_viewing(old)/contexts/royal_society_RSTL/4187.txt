(as above shown) to be 1‚Äù, the probable error of the difference of the catalogues
becomes /4+1=2"-236 ; which divided by 80, the interval between the epochs,
gives 0-028 as the probable error of the annual proper motion deduced from
the comparison of the two catalogues, 80 far as it depends on errors of ob-
servation. Hence it appears that a proper motion amounting to 0"'1 annually
(the smallest which has been admitted in the present inquiry) considerably ex-
ceeds the probable errors of the catalogues, and consequently that the proper
motions which have been under consideration not only have a real existence, but
are determined with sufficient precision to give a result worthy of considerable
confidence.

On the whole it may be said, that although the present result, if it stood by itself,
would scarcely be considered as of sufficient weight to establish the fact and direc-
tion of the solar motion in space, yet coinciding as it does with those of ArGeLanDeR

and Orro STrvve, it considerably increases the probability of the conclusions ob-
tained by those astronomers. It is now shown that stars situated in every region
of the heayens agree in their indication of a general motion directed towards one
particular quarter ; and as this agreement, not only of the results of different inves-
