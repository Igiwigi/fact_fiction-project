| 12. Here again reference to Table III will show that these great apparent differences
are largely due to the variable nature of the initial coefficient of oxidation. The
striking fact is that in a muscle which has been prevented from contracting by
cutting the nerve some 1 hour and 25 minutes before the estimations commenced,
stimulation of a rhythmic nature once a second for 15 minutes produced a hyper-
oxidation which persisted for at least five hours and a half. In this experiment, estimations were made on the gaseous exchange in both
gastrocnemii. In both cases the nerves were cut, but that of the left gastro-
cnemius was not stimulated.
