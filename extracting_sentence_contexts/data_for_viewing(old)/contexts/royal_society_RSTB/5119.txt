the coracoid branch of the hypobranchial artery, outwards and dorsal, between the
pericardium and the pelvic and trunk muscles that arise from the clavicles, to the joint
that unites the pelvis to the pectoral arch. Here it enters the wall of the great pectoral
lymph sinus that runs along the mesial border of the clavicle, and, passing dorsal to the
pelvis, continues back in the wall of this sinus in close association with the coracoid
artery and vein to the junction of this artery with the subclavian upon the inner surface
of the ascending arm of the clavicle. :
At this point. close to the coracoid cartilage, it breaks up into a small plexus and gives
origin to numerous branches. Three of these (fig. 6g, h, 7) are larger than the rest and
form, in fact, divergent terminal divisions of the main stem: (1) (fig. 6, h), a vessel

that passes outwards, through the coracoid to the outer side of the articulation
between the shoulder girdle and the fin, and, passing distally between the pterygio-
phores, enters the outer margin of the base of the fin, to traverse the canal
embraced by the bifurcated ends of the fin rays, and unites with the second
division in an arcade (fig. 6, pet.l) similar to that described above in connection with
the pelvic fin.

At the point where this first division of the coracoid vessel emerges from the joint
