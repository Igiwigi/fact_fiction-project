where X and Y have the values given in (1), and for p we must substitute the
expression (18), remembering, however, that we must ultimately restore the factor Pow
We may also temporarily omit the factor C in the expression for the electric forces. To find the current function R we must eliminate 8, but owing to the fact that p
contains 6 and X, this does not seem to be possible directly. The difficulty must be
turned by eliminating in the first place R, and if 8 is then found, R may be
determined from the first of the above equations. It may occur to the reader that R
might be more directly obtained if the resistivity were introduced instead of the
conductivity.
