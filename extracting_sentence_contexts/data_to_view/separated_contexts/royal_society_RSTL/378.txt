On the structure of the organs of respiration in animals
which appear to hold an intermediate place between those of the
class pisces and the class vermes, and in two genera of the last
mentioned class. By Sir Everard Home, Bart. I. P,R.S.

Read June 1, 1815. Fro all the facts in comparative anatomy with which we
are acquainted, there is reason to believe, that the great
scheme of the animal creation is composed of one uniform
gradation of structures, and it is only by collecting the diffe-
rent appearances met with in the same organs of different
animals, into regular series, that a solid basis can be laid on
which a general system may be constructed, In this view of the subject, every link that is added to any
one series, acquires a value; as it increases, in however small
a degree, the foundation upon which an edifice of such im-
portance is to be raised, and therefore may not be undeser-
ving of the attention of the Society. In fishes, the mode of respiration by means of gills is well
understood, and there is probably no better criterion by which
an animal may be allowed to belong to that class, than its
having gills.
