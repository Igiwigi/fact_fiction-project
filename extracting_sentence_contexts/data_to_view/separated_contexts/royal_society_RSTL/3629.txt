Comparative measures were carefully taken of the spectrum

sults being as follows (se fig. 6.) :—

and clear, but being aware that in certain states of the atmosphere a vertical beam
of halo-light passes through the sun, which in a meridional position of that luminary
might give rise to a perceptible prolongation, both upwards and downwards (though
in fact no such prolongation was perceived at the red end), it was often repeated, and
always with the same result, on subsequent occasions, whether the sun were on or
near the meridian, or otherwise. Comparative trials, also with other yellow papers,
fully satisfied me of the cause being traceable to a peculiarity in the colouring mate-
rial, as to its reflective powers. In particular, a certain paper (No. 1055.) coloured
with the juice of Chryseis californica, whose tint was almost identical with that of the
turmeric paper, only s0omewhat brighter, was tried, and the spectrum measured on
this paper was found to terminate precisely at 440, i. e. (correcting for semidiameter)
at 40-4, the very same as if white paper had been used.
