Unfortunately the coupling of even apparently unrelated and harmless failures can give
rise to severe shell-type instability. . . Besides, Thompson & Hunt [40] observe ‘that an optimum design is by its very nature
imperfection-sensitive, since any deviation from the idealized optimum design must yield a lower
failure bound’. Thus, despite the fact that ‘the ethics of our profession today does not allow any design for a
structure without optimization’ [41], one should proceed with extreme caution, as Michael and
his co-workers showed. The answer to the extreme question [42], ‘Shall we abandon optimization
theory?’ should be in the negative, as was substantiated by Ohsaki & Ikeda [43]. These authors
specifically showed that ‘imperfection sensitivity law varies according to the type of a critical
point, and coincident critical points are not always imperfection-sensitive.
