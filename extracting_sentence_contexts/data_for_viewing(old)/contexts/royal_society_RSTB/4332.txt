When these facts had been ascertained the obvious line of further research was to
investigate how far the sub-districts in the Western and Southern divisions showed the
same characteristics as the districts themselves. These districts are in the case of the
West six in number, and in the case of the South eight. It would be very laborious
to make the necessary investigation among the weekly number of deaths for so many
different districts. Fortunately this detail is not necessary. Certain arithmetical
simplifications are possible. Thus 87 weeks is almost exactly one and two-third years ;
97 weeks one and seven-eighth years ; and 109} weeks two and one-tenth years. The
latter figure differs by only one-fortieth of a year or approximately one-eightieth of a
period from two and one-eighth years. As the data contain only 10 periods this is
not a difference sufficient to introduce any serious error, and in addition the error is
the same in effect in all the sub-districts so that any differences found between the
different sub-districts will be independent of this simplification. The subsequent
