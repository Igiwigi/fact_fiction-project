gurface; that is, either immediately beneath the stalagmite when this existed, or without
any covering where it did not.

(5) All those found south of the Crystal Gorge lay on the suwrface. There was no
$talagmite in this branch of the cavern.

(ce) Excepting one only, no bones were met with either on the surface or in the upper-
most 3 feet of the bed in the West Chamber.

(4) With the exception of one instance only, in which three small bones were found
year the bottom of the © funnel-shaped pipe” between the North Entrance and the
Seep Slide Hole, all the fossils which occupied depths exceeding 5 feet were met with
IN the West Chamber and the contiguous portion of the Flint-knife Gallery; in fact in

e basin-shaped hollow (d, fig. 2, Plate XLIIL.) formerly described.
S The two last facts (c and d) show that in their arrangement the bones followed the
<ntour of the lower rather than the upper surface of the bed; and thus support the
gestion already made, that the materials which rose above the normal level of the
ird bed were not really a portion of it.
.5 The solitary bone found on the surface in the West Chamber had one of its ends cut
&, apparently with some sharp instrument.
'S The fossils in the southern division of the Reindeer Gallery were the remains of
ng small rodents; they lay in three separate heaps, one of which contained as many
8 425 bones, comprising probably the elements of complete skeletons.
Z Omitting these, the remaining 1112 specimens exhumed in other parts of the cavern
