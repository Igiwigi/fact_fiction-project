The difference is insignificant and is in the wrong direction. The fact that so big a
difference exists in the case of the most highly disturbed group of days between the
lengths of the intervals, as derived from the subsequent and previous pulses, raises a
doubt as to the complete success of the method we have adopted for eliminating the
effect of skewness when the skewness is large. If we took as the length of the interval
half the interval between the crests of the first secondary pulses subsequent and
previous, which closely resemble one another, we should find 27-20 from the days of
character « 1-5, as compared with 27-04 from, the 5 selected D days, and 27-01 from the
selected Q days. The intervals derived from, the second, third and fourth subsequent
pulses appear all slightly longer for the days of character « 1-5 than for the 5 selected
D days, but the difference between the two 108-day intervals comes out less than 0-3
day.
