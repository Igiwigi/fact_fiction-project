Now whereas it is certain that the Diſtance
of the Moon is about 60 Semidiameters of the
Earth, and that a Degree is leſs than 70 Engliſh
Miles ; therefore, I ſay, that the Concluſion which
ſeems to follow from the Jamaica Experiment,
cannot be allowed to be true, And the Experi-
ments made by Richer, in the Iſland of Cayenna,
would till raake a greater Difference betwixt the
Diameters of the Earth, than thoſe made in Jamaica. And the Lengths of the Paris and London Pendu-
lums compared together, would make it greater
than one 231 Part of the Whole, as it was found
in Article 5, d
8. From all the Experiments made with Pend
lums, it appears that the Theory makes them longer
in


(105)
in Iſlands, than they are found in fact. The Lon-
don Pendulum ſhould be longer when compared ro
the Paris one, than it really is: The Jamaica
Pendulum, when compared to the London one,
which vibrates in a greater Iſland, ſhould be Ionger
than is found by Experience ; and the Pendulum in
Cayenna (a ſmaller Iſland than Jamaica) ſhould
+ {till be longer. This Defe& of Gravity in Iſlands
S is very probably occaſioned by the Vicinity of
> agreat Quantity of Water, which being ſpecifically
= lighter than Land, attrads leſs in Proportion to its ,
S Bulk.
