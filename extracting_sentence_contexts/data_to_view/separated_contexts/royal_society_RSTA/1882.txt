In 1940, Hulubei
and Cauchois therefore published a short letter in Comptes rendus in which they reiterated their
prior claim for element 85, and stated that they hoped to present a complete spectral analysis
with the reproduction of photographic evidence. The paper ends with the sad mitigation that
‘malheureusement nos travaux ont été interrompus par la guerre [sadly our work was interrupted
by the war]’ [106]. Their research was in fact continued at the Instituto Superiore di Sanita in
Rome by Manuel Valdares, who had studied under Cauchois. Valdares’ experiments employed
a larger sample of radon than had been available in Paris, and the characteristic X-ray lines of
element 87 again revealed themselves. Most of this work was published in the somewhat obscure
proceedings of his institute [107].
