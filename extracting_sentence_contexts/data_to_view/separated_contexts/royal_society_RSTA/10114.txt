The values of and of nx for gold and for silver have already been
calculated for all values of p in the case of red light (A = °630) and in that of
yellow light (A = °589). The results are given in Table IV. of the former com-
munication.{ But in order to obtain a true conception of the colours of such media,
corresponding calculations must be effected for other colours also. Now, in the case of silver, the numerical values of all those functions of Nk,-. and
n,-1 Which have hitherto been calculated for the case of » = 1—those functions, in
fact, which relate to molecules or small spheres of silver in vacwo—vary continuously
from red (A = 630) to blue (A= °450). If, therefore, the values of n and nx
corresponding to \ = ‘450 and \} = ‘500 be now calculated for all values of p, the
values of m and nx for other colours may be obtained approximately by interpolation
between A = 630 and \ = 450,

The values of m and nx corresponding to \ = ‘450 and \ = ‘500 have therefore
been calculated for certain values of », by means of equations (18) and (19). The
values of nx,-, and n,., used for the calculations were carefully determined by
R. 8.
