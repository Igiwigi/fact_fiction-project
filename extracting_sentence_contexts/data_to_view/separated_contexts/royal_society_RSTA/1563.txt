ยง20. Relation between Aperture and Dise Problems in Hlectrostatics and Hydrodynamics. The considerations advanced briefly in this section are not new, being in fact contained,
implicitly at least, in several papers on wave motion by Lord RaytetcH. It seems
desirable, however, to give them a compact statement, as no such statement can be
found in any treatise. Consider two problems, I and II respectively. I is that of a charge E at P, producing
a potential V in space, in front of an aperture of any shape in an infinite plane earthed
