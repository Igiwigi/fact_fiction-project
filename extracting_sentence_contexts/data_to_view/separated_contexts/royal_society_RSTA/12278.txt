simple a theory for the explanation of all hysteresis phenomena, yet I believe it could
be made to account for nearly all the known facts.* But, at present, even if this
simple assumption were made, we are very much in the dark as to how I, varies with
H and ¥, and are compelled to fall back on such pure conjectures as are illustrated in
the foot-note. To mention only one thing—nearly all the detailed experiments on
hysteresis deal only with variations of H parallel to itself.

73. Thus it is useless to attempt a satisfactory theory of hysteresis at present,
though we can see vaguely how, perhaps, in the future it may be made to fit into the
present theory.
