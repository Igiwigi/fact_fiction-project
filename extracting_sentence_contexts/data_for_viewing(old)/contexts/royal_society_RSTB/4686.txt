the genus (subnomine Protechinus), remarked that “the pores are seemingly
arranged in groups of two ...; the third pair, however, is so much reduced that
it is hardly visible.” Later he uses the term “ obsolete” to describe the condition of
the included pore-pairs. In Noetlingia, then, there seems reason to believe that one
set of plates, together with its series of podia, is in process of destruction.

Lastly, in the gerontic Heterocentrotus described below, there are in some of the
compounds undoubted included plates which are so reduced that they do not extend
beyond the bosses of the tubercles, and are quite imperforate. Other included plates
of rather more complete preservation show the pore-pairs in various stages of
resorption or blocking.

In view of these facts, it seems legitimate to propound a second principle, viz.,
that plate-crushing is capable of obliterating ambulacral plates, with or without the
corresponding destruction of their podia.

The third and last phase of plate-complexity that need be mentioned here is the
reduction and combination of compound plates, forming super-compounds. ‘This
condition occurs in many groups of the Diademoida, and its gradual development can
be traced in the ambulacra of large specimens of Hehinus esculentus. It represents
the highest type of ambulacral complexity, although a super-compound of one genus
need not include as many pore-pairs as a normal compound of another. I have never
seen a case where more than two compounds become united, but there seems no
reason to doubt the possibility of the occurrence of “ super-triads.”
