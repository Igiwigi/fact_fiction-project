fuse to form rhachis and hyporhachis, which in turn fuse to form the calamus.
The calamus then splits up into barbs, fig. 28, Plate 19, which fuse to form the
rhachis and hyporhachis of the teleoptile. A slight constriction is usually present
at the base of the calamus of the protoptile, probably marking the site of the inferior
umbilicus, and below this the calamus splits into the barbs of the succeeding
definitive feather.

It is possible that this peculiar state of affairs is due to the rapid growth of the
teleoptile. Usually a quiescent period sets in between the formation of the two
generations of feathers, but the feather papilla of the rectrix of the duckling is
obviously in a very active state throughout the nestling period.

This offers striking proof of the facts disputed by previous authors that (a) the
second generation of feathers is formed in the same follicles as their predecessors,
and (6) that the feather papilla resumes activity prior to the shedding of the old
feather.

(iii) Starlings
The first coat worn by the starling consists of a very rudimentary nestling down

similar fundamentally to that of the chick. It was unfortunately impossible to
obtain sufficiently early stages to study the development of these protoptiles.
