The air in these experiments was compressed in contact with oil, and
hence moisture and impurities in the air are probably the source of difference. These
experiments, too, appeared to indicate invariability of the specific heat over a con-
siderable range of pressure. Subsequent experiments, which from the very fact of the
existence of the discrepancy have been multiplied in number, disprove this result. There is an undoubted diminution of the specific heat with decreasing pressure or
density. A plausible explanation of the first result exists in the very certain presence
of moisture in the gas, taken in conjunction with the course of procedure adopted.
