Moreover such a hypothesis is in accordance with many facts which seem
inexplicable on the excalation theory. Putting on one side the extraordinary amount
of inter- and excalation at different spots in the vertebral column which, as
mentioned above, would be necessary to account for the facts, there still remain
those instances in which a nerve may partly pass through the girdle and partly over
it, and also those in which, with a normal vertebral column, the serial number of the
girdle-piercing nerve varies on the two sides of the same animal. On the migration
theory such facts receive a simple explanation, whilst on the excalation theory it is
difficult to see how they can be accounted for. :

Summary.

The facts recorded in this paper may be conveniently summarised as follows :â€”

(1) The anterior collector passes through a stage in which more branches are
present than in subsequent development. As development proceeds, some of
these most rostral branches degenerate, so that the older embryos contain
less branches than the younger embryos, and adults again less than older
embryos.

(2) A posterior collector is always formed in embryonic life, and is never found in
the adult forms.
