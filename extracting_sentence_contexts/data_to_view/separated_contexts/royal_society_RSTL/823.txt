An account of these specimens
formed the substance of my second paper. Since that time I have frequently communicated with these
gentlemen, also with the Rev. PeETER Hawker of Wood-
chester rectory, Minchinhampton, and Dr. CareenTer of
Lyme; and have received from them many specimens I had
not seen before, some of which it was difficult to determine
to what part of the skeleton they belonged : but that being
ascertained, and a similarity discovered to bones of the orni-
thorhynchus paradoxus, that circumstance alone made them,
in my opinion, of sufficient importance to become the subject
of a third communication to this Society. There is also another reason for bringing forward these
facts, and for doing so without any unnecessary delay ; for,
as my former papers were the means by which I acquired
them, their being made known to the public, may lead those


Sir EvERARD HOME 07 the fossit bones of an animal, &c, 25

gentlemen who have opportunities of examining the cliffs in
which the bones are found, to renew their labours, and assist
in making out all the essential parts of the skeleton.

. In the description I am to give of the bones received, I
shall begin with one, a part of which is shown lying on the
scapula in Mr. BuLLocx's specimen, engraved in the first
Paper; it was then taken for the portion of a rib accidentally
brought there, but it is now found to have been nearly in its
natural situation. It bears a resemblance to the clavicular
bone in birds.
