It only remains for us to consider the relations which result from the associa-
tion of contiguous grains or crystallites, that is to say, from their surfaces in contact,
or joints. The general crystalline orientation of the paste on both borders of the
joint is not the same, and the elementary crystals belonging to two different groups
may not be as firmly united as they would be in the interior of a homogeneous
group ; a joint, therefore, becomes a surface of weakness (sometimes passing pro-
gressively into a fissure), which etching by a reagent enlarges and renders visible. In
fact, all our etched surfaces are divided by a network of joints, which correspond with
the outlines of the grains and crystallites. The joints revealed by the action of sulphuric acid are simple furrows, which occur
