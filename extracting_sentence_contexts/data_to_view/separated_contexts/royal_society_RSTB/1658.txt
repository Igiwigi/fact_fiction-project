In Marsupials, however, owing to the retention of a
canal down the axis of the enamel prism, they persist, and can be more effectually
studied. When the ameloblast processes have not been torn off at the level of the
honeycomb region, they are seen to start out from the axis of each ameloblast, then
at a little distance from it to be laterally glued together (fig. 7), and then to become
distinct again and to run on to the dentine, getting smaller and more distinct from
one another as they go, and sometimes showing very plainly the spiral turns
characteristic of the tubes in the enamel, which indeed I believe them to constitute. As confirmatory of the view that the fibres calcify centripetally may be mentioned
the fact that within certain limits the older the enamel, z.e., the further from the
ameloblasts it lies, the smaller do the fibres, as seen in decalcified sections, appear. It has been pointed out by Mr. Leon Wriitams (14) that the long axes of the
ameloblasts in many animals by no means correspond with the direction of the prisms
of the completed enamel.
