The term Q;' would be called on to a smaller extent if the atmospheric conductivity
is not uniform, but varies with the zenith distance (w) of the sun. In this case the
12-hour oscillation Q,? would contribute to the 24-hour magnetic variation Q,', and
the 24-hour oscillation Q,' to the 12-hour magnetic variation Q,’, but the effect would
be much more marked in the former case than in the latter. It was shown, in fact,

* Variations of higher frequency were not considered. + In equation (10) of the second memoir the coefficient of Ys? should be 9°23 in place of 11°16 (this
is the coefficient of yo?
