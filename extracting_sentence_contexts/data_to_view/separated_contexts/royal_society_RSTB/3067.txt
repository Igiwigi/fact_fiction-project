BURCH ON CASES OF COLOUR-BLINDNESS. I drew attention to the corresponding phenomenon in the blue and violet in my
previous paper, but did not then realise its importance in practical testing. Part of the difficulty in applying the test to cases of colour-blindness is due to the
fact that their deficiencies as regards colour are frequently compensated for by an
abnormally keen perception of intensity, and they accordingly notify three or four
additional points of change, each of which has to be tested. And moreover, until
some idea has been formed as to the relative extent of their existing colour sensations,
it is impossible to decide on the proper wave-length for producing fatigue. Typical Examples of Normal Colour Sensations.
