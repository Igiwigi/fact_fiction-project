centage of dextrals from the E broods of F,. We may evade these difficulties by
assuming (1) that dominance is incomplete, (2) that the high E-ness put into the cross
is masked by the vigour of heterosis. This brings us into the predicament that we
cannot be sure whether a brood of, say, 150 sinistrals and 2 dextrals is a masked < brood
or a x brood, and, if we assume that these alternatives are exclusive, makes the formal
interpretation of K x E crosses impossible.

Or we may consider the possibility that E-ness is not of itself a type of sinistrality,
but the product of an independent gene whose only phenotypic effect is the modification
of sinistrality towards the production of odd dextrals and other monstrous forms, the
allelomorph being simply the absence of E-ness. This interpretation involves the
possibility that E-ness might be carried in « strains, though it could obtain expression
only in sinistral snails. It is in a general way not inconsistent with most of our facts.
Against it is (a) the impossibility of being sure that we ever have sinistrality completely
free of E-ness, (b) the failure to get a definite separation of < from « among the recessive
segregates of A x K crosses and in E x K crosses, and (c) the emergence of high E-ness
in F, of an A x K cross in which the « and « lines had been pure for four generations

for three generations since. The occurrence is not altogether conclusive, for the « line
