3. Lead («)-(c) and Lead JJ. The chart contains a slight assumption, namely that the upstroke in (a)-(b) and (a)-(c) commences
at the same instant. As a matter of fact, in this instance, the relation was not precisely shown, but
we found that (a’) in (a’)-(b’) became negative 0:0010 second before (a) in (a)-(c). We have
consequently placed the upstroke in leads (a)-(b) and (a)-(c) on the same line. It will be seen that the culmination in lead (a)-(c) corresponds very accurately with the upstroke
of the intrinsic deflection in lead (c)-(d).
