amount of 50 GtCO2, which is on the low end of values from the SSP-based 1.5°C pathways.
Assuming that during 2016-2020 another 25 Gt of CO? emissions will be emitted from land use,
our sensitivity analysis finds a range of 650-1680 Gt gross anthropogenic CO2 emissions during
the period 2016-2100. This range does not take into account net negative land-use emissions that
would occur if land turned into a natural or engineered carbon sink. It also does not take into
account CDR from the atmosphere to the geological or ocean reservoir. Such measures would not
be required if the gross CO2 emissions remained within the 1.5°C budget throughout the twenty-
first century. This is only the case for the overlap in ranges above 650 GtCOz, i.e. for low gross FFI
CO emissions close to the limiting case and high estimates of the remaining 1.5°C budget [27].
Thus very deep FFI CO emissions reductions drawing on all levers from final energy demand
to carbon intensity reductions may still be able to limit warming to 1.5°C without overshoot if
and only if the 1.5°C budget turns out to be at the upper end of the estimated range. However,
this finding needs to be qualified by the fact that our limiting case of FFI CO2 emissions has
been constructed to make it unlikely that emissions could be even lower, at the expense of the
likelihood that it actually can be achieved. So the overlap might be vanishing small, even if the
1.5°C budget is high. If it is not high, CDR will become indispensable to limit warming to 1.5°C.
