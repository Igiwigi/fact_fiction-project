A possible supposition is that their source should be in the S() limit. If so we
should expect it to appear strongly in the S lines, and so in the 8, (2) lines considered
above. As a fact, however, there is no sign of such in either of the 8 groups adduced,
except a very dubious one 1425 between two L.D. lines each of which has an
ambiguity +4. It takes place between 8, = 27964 and 26539 backwards, so that if
its source were here it would be a positive displacement on S() or a negative one
on (2), both unusual. The strongest argument for its source being in the 31851 is
that the separations in question show themselves in all orders of F (m)â€”in other
words, occur in the limit F (~).
