for effective comparison in that simplified environment. Pre-
serves focused on conservation may manage their bison
herds as wildlife or livestock, but typically much less inten-
sively than production systems. Cattle are rarely, if ever,


managed as wildlife or with a conservation focus; conse-
quently, many comparisons between bison and cattle are
inevitably confounded by differing land management
approaches or, alternatively, focus on comparing two similar
production systems (i.e. small pastures intensively managed).
In other words, many of the observed differences between
species may in fact be largely due to varying management
plans (e.g. the human domain) rather than ecology of the
species. In order for bison to be substantially different from
domestic livestock, they need to interact with large landscapes
where they can respond to heterogeneity associated with topo-
edaphic conditions, complex patterns of fire and other
important species like prairie dogs [2,27]. However, few
places exist where these conditions are present at scales relevant
to any semblance of ecosystem restoration. Therefore, rewilding
plans that hinge almost exclusively on changing the herbivore
within the modern landscape context are unlikely to produce
intended outcomes without substantial management plans.
