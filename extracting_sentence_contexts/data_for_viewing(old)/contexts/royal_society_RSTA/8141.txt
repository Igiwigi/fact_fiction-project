It is now possible to see the relation between best critical regions and the region
defined by the principle of likelihood described above. Suppose that for a hypothesis
H, belonging to the set of alternatives Q, the probability law for a given sample is
defined by

(1) an expression of given functional type p (2, a3, ... @»)

(2) the values of ¢ parameters contained in this expression, say

This law for H, may be written as p,= p,(2, 2%, ...%). The hypothesis of
maximum likelihood, H (Q max.), is obtained by maximising p, with regard to these
c parameters, or in fact from a solution of the equations,

The values of the «’s so obtained are then substituted into p to give p(Qmax.). Then
