so little occupied in finding carrion that it will visit traps, that the greatest incidence of
strike in living sheep occurs. In this connexion it will be recognized that the conditions
inducing strike change only slowly on the living animal, so that the period over which
a given animal will constitute a source of attraction to primary flies will be much longer
than that of a carcass. Individual sheep, however, do not offer the degree of attraction
afforded by a single carcass, and this remains true even of a group of attractive animals.
Traps placed in the area will therefore not be ignored to the same extent as when suitable
and sufficient carcasses are available.

For a more detailed account of the use of traps as a means of gauging fly populations,
reference should be made to the paper by Davidson (1933).

6. Summary of main facts
In spite of the drawbacks associated with the methods employed in recording field
populations of blowflies, certain information has been obtained and is summarized here,
since it will be used in the discussion which follows.
(1) The four species exhibit definite seasonal trends, both in their breeding period on
carrion and in the incidence of their adult fly populations in the field.

(2) They may be divided into two seasonal groups, viz. (a) Summer breeders: C. albiceps
and C. marginalis. (b) Winter breeders: Lucilia spp. and C. chloropyga.
