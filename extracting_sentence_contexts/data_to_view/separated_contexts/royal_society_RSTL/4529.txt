The same reasoning holds in the case of the spheres of flexion
being of different extent ; and there are other arguments arising from the analysis
on this head, which it would be superfluous to go through, because what is delivered
above enables any one to pursue the subject. The demonstration also holds if we

suppose the deflective force to act as L of the distance, while that of inflexion acts as. But I bave taken m=7 as simpler, and also as more probably the fact. I have said that the rays become less easily inflected and deflected ; but it is plain

that on the polarized side they are not inflected or deflected at all. Their disposition
on the opposite side is a matter of degree; their polarization is absolnte and their
flexion null.
