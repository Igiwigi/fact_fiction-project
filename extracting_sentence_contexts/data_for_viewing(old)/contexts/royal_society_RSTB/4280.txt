picked on Monday, 25-54 on Tuesday. The first 100 bolls picked (or the counted number if less than
100) from each plot were put into boxes and removed to the laboratory.

Boll Weight, etc.—These bolls from each week were weighed to obtain the mean boll weight. Each lot
was then ginned on the 12-inch roller hand gin, and the lint weighed to determine the ginning out-turn.
Ten grammes of seed from each ginning were then weighed and counted out to obtain the mean seed weight.
These operations began on August 12 and ended on November 5, taking two days in each week, and
making a total of 1300 pickings and ginnings, nearly 4000 weighings, and the counting of 150,000 seeds.

The weighings for ginning out-turn were all made immediately after ginning, and are thus comparable
inter se although no correction is made for humidity ; hence the actual values are rather low, aided by the
fact that Giza is rather too far south for the Assili variety.

Counting seeds in a known weight is both faster and safer than weighing a counted number when
native labour is employed.

Grading.— About 500 grm. of seed cotton were picked in conventional pickings from the plants of each
plot which were not included in the observation rows.

Yield.—Plot No. 44 was picked to check the yields computed from the observation rows. It gave
6 kantars as against a computed yield of 6-15 kantars.

Cost of Experiment.—The details of the time table have been given above because the conduct of the
experiment was only an item in a very heavy season’s work, so that a regular routine was necessary. It
