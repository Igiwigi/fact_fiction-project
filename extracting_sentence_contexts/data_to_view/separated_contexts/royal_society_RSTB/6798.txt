These facts are
in agreement with other tyrosinase systems. We are not yet able to state the reasons for the failure of white and red varieties of
Metridium to develop melanin in nature, and for its appearance in the dark forms. Since the red and white varieties possess all the substances required for melanin
formation, the facts support the idea that we are dealing with an instance of ‘dominant
albinism’ in a genetical sense (Gortner 1911 @). The brown and the grey colour systems
differ from the white in that each permits deposition of melanin products in its special
way. We have already seen that these systems behave as though they were genetically
independent.
