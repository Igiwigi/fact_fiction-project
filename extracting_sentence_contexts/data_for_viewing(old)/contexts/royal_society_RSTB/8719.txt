Moreover, visual cortex responses evoked by visually salient Bred time

stimuli (e.g. flickering checkerboards, moving dot displays) Ngreen
are also modulated by the level of perceptual load in a task favellow
[32-34]. These modulations can even be found as early as pri-
mary visual cortex (V1) and the lateral geniculate nucleus (b) 100
[35,36]. Furthermore, effects of perceptual load were found
on temporally early signals [37] and within the first 100 ms of ~ 90F low load
processing [38]. In fact, this last result was obtained with = -@ high load

Clearly then, distractor processing throughout the visual
stream depends on the level of perceptual load. For most the- 50

ories of awareness, such variation in neural processing is a
prerequisite for variation in awareness [39-41]; awareness is cor-
related with the extent to which the stimulus activates both early
sensory and category-selective areas of visual cortex [42-49].
However, without direct assessment of their effects on
