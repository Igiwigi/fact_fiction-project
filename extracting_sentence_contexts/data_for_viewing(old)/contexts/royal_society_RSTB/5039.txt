namely, complete expansion of all the chromatophores. Hence it will be seen that
complete uniformity is the most prominent feature of these reactions, and that there does

not appear to be any differentiation among the chromatophores to account for the appearance
produced in the normal life of the fish and noted in Part II.

It has been urged that adrenalin is possibly responsible for pallor in fish. The following
facts, brought to light in the present paper and in a previous one, militate against this :-—
1. Adrenalin causes no such differential contraction between xanthophores and erythro-
phores as has been observed in the dabs on white backgrounds. 2. Even the minimal
dose of adrenalin administered intramuscularly causes a complete contraction of all the
chromatophores—no gradation is seen.

Having found no differential mechanism in the peripheral structures, it is now necessary
to investigate the brain, in which a “‘ centre ” connected in some way with the control of
colour changes is known to exist.
