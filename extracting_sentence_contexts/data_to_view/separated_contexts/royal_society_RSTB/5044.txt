For
these reasons I feel pretty sure that in these small connectives between the system of
“fine ’ vessels and the lymphatics of the oral mucous membranes, there are valves so
directed as to hinder the flow of fluid from the “ fine” vessels into the lymphatics. It is highly improbable that these valved passages in the mucous membranes are the
only means of communication between the “ fine” vessel system and the lymphatics. The fact that the connections in the mucous membrane are valved against outflow
from the “ fine ” vessels, and that injection was evidently forced through them only
with difficulty into the lymphatics, while at the same time the smaller lymphatics in the
mucous membrane, skin, and branchiostegal membrane were well filled with injection
introduced through the “ fine ” vessels, indicates, I think, pretty clearly that the two
systems must somewhere have means of communication other than through the valved
passages in the mucous membrane. ‘Theoretically also there should be some means
by which fluid entering the “ fine” vessels from the lymph plexus in the mucous
membranes through these valved passages can re-enter the circulation. Where the
re-entry takes place, I have been unable to demonstrate with any certainty.
