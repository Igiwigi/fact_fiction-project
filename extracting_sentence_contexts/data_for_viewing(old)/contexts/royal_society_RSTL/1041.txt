it is doubtless owing, in a great measure, that the charge ap-
pears to exert 80 great a force in propelling the bullets.

That the conical form of the lower part of the bore, where
it unites with 'the chamber, has a considerable share in pro-
ducing this extraordinary effect, is however very certain, as I

have found by experiments made with a view merely to ascer-
tain that fact.

I will finish this paper by a computation, which will show
that the force of the elastic fluid generated in the combustion
of gunpowder, enormous as it is, may. be satisfactorily ac-
counted for upon the supposition that its force depends solely
on the elasticity of watery vapour, or steam.

It has been shown by a variety of experiments made in Eng-
land, and in other countries, and lately by a well conducted
set of experiments made in France by M. pe BETANncouR, and
published in Paris under the auspices of the Royal Academy
of Sciences, in the year 1790, that the elasticity of steam is
