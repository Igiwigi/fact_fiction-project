These figures show that the concentration of

eights amidships, in ships with central batteries and armour belts, while it renders Yhe conditions of strain more complicated, reduces the actual shearing-strains far below

ose experienced by completely protected ships. There is doubtless a great reserve of
trength in all ships against shearing-strains, 80 that this fact has not much practical

Aveight ; but, as I shall show hereafter, the severer bending-strains are similarly reduced
when the weights are concentrated, and this is a much more important feature. The BexviNG MOMENTS Tesulting from the action of the vertical forces on a ship
floating in still water next claim attention. I have already indicated the method by
which these moments may be estimated when the distribution of the weight and buoy-
ancy are known, and will therefore proceed at once to the graphical method of record-
ing them.
