Taz following investigation is the result of an attempt to simplify the analytical treat-
ment of the problem of the Attraction of Ellipsoids. The application to this particular
case, of certain known propositions relating to closed surfaces in general, showed that
the principal theorems could easily be deduced without taking account of any other
properties of the ellipsoid than those expressed by two differential equations, of which
the truth is evident on inspection. In fact if we take the equation

a? y? 22 FTE
xitexr tant
we see at once that the expression on the left side, considered as a function of &, y, 2, h.
satisfies the two partial differential equations
