anechanical treatment which is often applied to the stoma problem.
& It may, however, be better to look at the problem in a more simple and direct manner,
As Leirces has done. Het has called attention to the variable result which follows pro-
gonged darkness. The case of Viola lutea, described by him, seems to resemble my
esults, inasmuch as the stomata gradually opened during several days. Lerraxs is
Anclined to explain the result (without much reason, I think) to the continued effect of a
moist atmosphere rather than of darkness. JI should be much more inclined to believe
that the stomata open in darkness owing to the epidermic cells being less resistant, and
losing their turgor before the guard cells do so. This explanation is mentioned by
Lerrees only to be set aside, but it agrees well with his own general conclusions, and
with his observations on the vitality of the guard cells ; it also fits in with my results
in Section 3.
The chief interest of the fact is in relation with the mechanism of the stoma, which
is dealt with in a later section (ยง 20).

(B.) Tae Errecr or AN ATMOSPHERE FREE FROM CO,.

The interest of this question is principally in relation to the mechanism of the
stoma, SCHELLENBERGER* states that in the absence of CO, the stomata shut, and
concludes that they do so for the same reason that darkness is supposed to close them,
