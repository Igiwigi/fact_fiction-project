However, clades A and B are only weakly differentiated, as indicated by intermediate bootstrap support (60%) and between-
clade distances, extensive allele sharing and a continuum of ancestry. (c) Neighbour-joining trees shown for each MLST
fragment. Sequences from strains from clade A are shown as filled circles, from clade B as open circles, from Typhi as filled
triangles and from other subspecies or bongori as open squares.

(e.g. figure 1c). The data obey the predictions of divergence, to approximately match the Salmonella data.
