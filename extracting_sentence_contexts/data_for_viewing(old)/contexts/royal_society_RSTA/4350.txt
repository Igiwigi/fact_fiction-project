40, which, in conjunction with the fact that collisions are much less effective (the molecule
being non-polar), explains the success of the experiment that immediately followed the first DBT
implementation [54]. In that experiment, the shape of the well isolated R(12) component was
probed at different temperatures, between the TPW and the gallium melting point (302.9146 K),
by using an ECDL. This spectral line was also selected by researchers at the PTB-Braunschweig,
for laser-spectroscopy-based measurement of the amount of substance fraction of CO) in Np
[55]. Figure 3 shows an example of repeated determinations of the gas temperature, as retrieved
at a pressure of about 100Pa from the analysis of 50 spectra by means of a Voigt profile; the
gas cell was temperature stabilized at 298.68(1) K, which was measured by using a standard
platinum-resistance thermometer. The histogram on the right side shows that the distribution
is Gaussian. The mean value is 298.77 K, with a standard deviation of the mean of 0.13K, in
a satisfactory agreement with the set point [54]. The use of the Voigt profile can be justified
by the fact that the mean free-path of the molecules, L is much larger than 4/27. From the
kinetic theory of gases, assuming that the molecules behave like hard spheres, it turns out that
T=kgT/ (x0*/2p), o and p being the molecular diameter and the gas pressure, respectively. Using
the 12-6 Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, it is possible to calculate the classical second
virial coefficient, from which o can be determined [56]. So doing, the mean free path results to be
51m, which is a factor of approximately 160 larger than 4/27. A confirmation about the validity
of the Voigt model for the aims of Doppler-width retrieval is found in [57], for the same CO
line in the Doppler regime. The CO) experiment of the Second University of Naples provided a
spectroscopic determination of the Boltzmann constant with a global uncertainty of 160 ppm, the
retrieved value being 1.38058(22) 10-7 J K~? [54].
