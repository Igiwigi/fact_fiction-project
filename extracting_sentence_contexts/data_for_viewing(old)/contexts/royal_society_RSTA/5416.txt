palaeoclimate time series. In a method called ‘potential analysis’, the climate
system is modelled as a Langevin equation, that is, the combination of a down-
gradient drift with a Wiener additive process and inference is made on the number
of wells of the potential function [102]. The method was applied on Pleistocene
climate records, yielding the conclusion that the number of wells increased from
two to three over the course of the Pleistocene [103].

However, our position so far has been to favour a Bayesian methodology,
because it allows one to encode physical constraints in the form of prior
distributions on model parameters. The Bayesian formalism is also naturally
designed for model calibration, selection and probabilistic predictions.

The fact is that Bayesian methods for selection and calibration of dynamical
systems on noisy observations are only emerging. In a recent attempt, we
considered a particle filter for parameter and state estimation [104]. To be honest,
there is ample room for progress. Whether the process of inference with simple
dynamical systems on palaeoclimate data will lead new insight in this context
still needs to be demonstrated.

This review benefited from stimulating discussions during the Isaac Newton Programme
Mathematical and Statistical Approaches to Climate Modelling and Prediction held in Cambridge
during the summer-autumn 2010. Guillaume Lenoir, Bernard De Saedeleer and Jonathan Rougier
