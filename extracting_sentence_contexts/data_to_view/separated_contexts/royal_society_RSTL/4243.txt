On approaching the female the
male attached himself by the sperm-tube to her side, and remained 80 attached
nearly a minute. Saw this most clearly, but owing to the movement of the animals
in the water it is almost impossible to see more than that there is a distinet adhesion.

« Most of the above obseryations were made with a single lens only, of two inches
focus, and the others with the microscope.”

So acute an observer as Mr. Br1GHTWELL could not possibly have been mistaken
in the fact 80 repeatedly observed, and it leaves us therefore in no doubt as to the
dicecious character of this singular family ; but there is another circumstance con-
nected with the anatomy of the male, s0 curious as possibly to be unique. The male
I have said possesses the same general figure as the female, it has also the contractile
vesicle, which I have ventured to name the respiratory sac (Plate XXXIV. fig. 12
DC), as well as the fibres furnished with the vibratory or ciliated tags, subservient

to the office of a circulation. It has also the ordinary rotiferous apparatus at the
head, through the agency of which its various movements of locomotion are performed;
the pink eye (Plate XXXIV. fig. 12 B) is distinct. 1 has however no mandibles,
no pharynz, es0phagus, pancreatic glands or stomach ; there appear to be no organs
of prehension, deglutition, digestion or assimilation.
