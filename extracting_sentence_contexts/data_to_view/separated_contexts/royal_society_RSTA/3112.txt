We would draw attention to the fact that our results for cane sugar, where they
overlap those obtained by Messrs. Morse and Fraser,t are somewhat higher. For
instance, a solution containing 282 grammes in the litre is given by them as having
an equilibrium pressure of 22°49 atmospheres, while we obtain 25 atmospheres, this
value being taken from the curve. There seems to be no mention in Messrs. Morse and Fraser’s account of their
work of any steps taken to determine the amount of solution which came through the
membranes.
