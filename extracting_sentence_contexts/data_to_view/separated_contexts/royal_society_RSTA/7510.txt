In the particular case when the distribution of «
is of the form d, the equation (6, 33) shows that the induced current, resulting from an
instantaneous change of 1 y in ¢, at time ¢ = 0, is everywhere perpendicular to the radius
vector and eastwards, and is of magnitude

105 x 10°

x(t, p) sin 8 ~ 10-4 y(¢, p) sind, (11, 1)
where x(¢,/) is given in various forms in (6, 36)—(6, 45). This function was calculated
as a function of p for a series of values of ¢, and is shown graphically in fig. 3. This figure
shows that the sheet current distribution, which is initially produced on the surface,
rapidly penetrates inwards, reaching a depth of some 200 km. within 5 min, The maxi-
mum current density at first decreases as it penetrates inwards, but after a depth of
about 900 km. is reached (in about 6 hr.) it begins to increase again, being, in fact,
proportional to 1/p. Also the speed with which the point of maximum current density
moves inwards now decreases rapidly, being proportional to p%*. The total induced
current is, of course, continually diminishing, so that the maximum gets sharper and
sharper as it penetrates farther inwards.
