falls entirely inside the boundary of a cluster it does not stimulate red cones only, or green
cones only, but many red cones and a few green cones, or the reverse. Also there will
always be some stray light falling on odd cones outside the cluster. In consequence, the


VISUAL PERCEPTION OF FINE DETAIL 619

colour of a point source will never be a pure red, or a pure blue-green, but always dilute
shades of these colours: namely, pink and pale blue-green. If, however, the point source
be insufficiently bright, even when its image does fall entirely on a single cluster, the colour
produced by that cluster maynot be perceived because vision is colourless, since the inten-
sity is below the threshold for the perception of colour as Abney (1895) has shown. The
cluster hypothesis thus accounts for four of the observed facts: (1) why a point source must=
be used; (2) why its intensity must lie between certain limits; (3) why colours are seen so
rarely; and (4) why only pale colours are seen. We have still to account, on the cluster
hypothesis, for the necessity for the source of light to be intermittent, and for it to be moving.
Movements are necessary in order to prevent fixation of the source by the eye, because the
source, consisting as it does of white light, would comprise green rays which are sharply
focused, and red and blue rays which are not. Further, the green rays have the greater
luminosity, the result being that a green cluster is selected for fixation. By moving the
source this fixation by a green cluster is prevented. If a continuous source of white light
be moved so that its image is continually changing its position on the retina, then even if,
by chance, that image falls on the centre of a cluster, for example, a red cluster, the colour,
which would normally be produced by that cluster, will not be seen, because repair of the
image occurs, as will be explained in Part XII (see ยง 162, p. 665).
