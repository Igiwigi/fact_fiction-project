with these tools. But if these statements were to be unreservedly accepted, these
operations would be inadequate to the purposes of the science; for the symbols of the
units of these substances, as expressed by the letters «, x, £, would be xt, x22, neces-
sitating in their construction the performance of an operation &, of which they had no
experience whatever,

The unit ez is the unit of a substance which the Laputians had, but which we have
not. It goes in our language under the name of the radical of formic acid. cx is the
symbol we assign to the unit of oxalic acid. I proceed to explain how the Laputians
dealt with this question.

«The accuracy of our experimentalists,” said they, © is beyond suspicion, and we
accept all the statements of fact made by them. But there is one point as to which it
is necessary to inquire. How do they know, as their objections imply, that the gases of
which they have taken the densities are really homogeneous gases ? If at the tempe-
rature at which the experiment has been made these gases are really split in two, it is
not necessary to modify, in this sense, our views.

« Now similar impediments have frequently stood in the way of our theories. But,
wherever it has been possible to look into the matter, as in the case of the pentachloride
of phosphorus, and even hydrated sulphuric acid, theory has come out triumphant,
This case is not strictly similar to those previously dealt with, but yet is not 80 dissimilar
as to lead us to look for a totally different account of the matter. 'That we should dis-
cover-a new tool at does not, we must confess, appear to us yery likely. But that we
should be able to do more, with our old tools «, z, &, than we have hitherto done is by
