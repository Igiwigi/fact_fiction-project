cos. 7, V1â€”p. in. 77 it follows that y must be a like
function of the same three quantities, We may remark here
that this consequence of LaeLace's reasoning appears to be
inconsistent with the premises : for it is hard to reconcile with
the rules of legitimate deduction that an equation obtained by
supposing y to be arbitrary, should, merely by having its form
changed, be made to prove that the same quantity must be
restricted to signify a function of a particular kind, But we
mention this only by the bye, without meaning to insist upon
it; although we cannot help thinking that it ought to have led
the learned author to entertain suspicions of the accuracy of
his calculations ; all that we intend by the foregoing abserva-
tion is to prove that in point of fact we shall embrace the
whole extent of LapLacr's method by supposing y to be a
rational and integral function of three rectangular co-ordinates
of a point in the surface of a sphere.

Supposjng then v! to denote such a function as has been
mentioned, we are to investigate the value of this integral,
