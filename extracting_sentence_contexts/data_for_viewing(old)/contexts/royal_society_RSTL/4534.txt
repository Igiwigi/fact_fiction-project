These determinations entirely agree with each other ; and the per-centage of oxygen
in the substance is probably in fact (as is given by this experiment) a little less than
that calculated from the amount of oxygen taken ap, as in pulverizing it it is not pos-
8ible to prevent the absorption of a little water by the baryta present, which must
diminish the per-centage of oxygen. There is no violent rush of gas during the

method to be as accurate as can be desired.
