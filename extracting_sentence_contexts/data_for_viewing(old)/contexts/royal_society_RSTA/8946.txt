For the determination of A,, A,, the oun and the links, reliable values of » and »,
are required. We have seen that the values obtained from the observed sets of lines
are subject to large observational errors. Nevertheless that the true value of 4 is

not far from that shown by S(1) is indicated by the fact that there are several
accurate separations of about 179°5, e.g.,

(6) 20621 179°31 (8) 20800 179°61 (4) 20980
(3) 26893 179°35 (1) 27072
