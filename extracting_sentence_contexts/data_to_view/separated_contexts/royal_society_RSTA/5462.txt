There is an undoubted diminution of the specific heat with decreasing pressure or
density. A plausible explanation of the first result exists in the very certain presence
of moisture in the gas, taken in conjunction with the course of procedure adopted. The lower pressures were obtained in fact by releasing a certain quantity of the gas
between the first and second series of experiments. Now if moisture be present, the
effect of this procedure is to concentrate the impurity at the lower pressure, for on
the moment of release there is an intense chilling of the vessel, which will have the
effect of precipitating any moisture in suspension in the gas. A small thing will con-
ceal the decrement of thermal capacity, as will be judged from the succeeding experi-
ments.
