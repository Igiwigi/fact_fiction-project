OF TEMPERATURE UPON THE BEAT OF THE DOG'S HEART. 687

the rate of beat of the Dog's heart, but the temperature of the blood sent to its capillaries.
Tn other words, temperature changes do nob influence the pulse-rate by stimulating
afferent nerves in the endocardium which then act upon cardio-motor ganglia, but
they act directly upon the muscle fibres or nerve cells of the organ.

(2.) A second subsidiary fact illustrated by the preceding experiments is that the
heart of the Dog can be nourished for some time and kept in a good state of functional

Â© activity when fed only with Calf's blood : but this blood is far less satisfactory than

Dog's blood, its use 800n leading to pulmonary cedema and alteration of the elastic
modulus of the cardiac muscular tissue.

(3.) As a third point of interest it may be noted that no clotting takes place in
defibrinated blood circulated for some hours through the living heart and langs. Such
blood contains an abundance of fibrino-plastin (paraglobulin) and fibrin ferment,
together with the quantity of salines necessary for the formation of fibrin if fibrinogen
were present. Fibrinogen, therefore, is produced in other organs of the body than
