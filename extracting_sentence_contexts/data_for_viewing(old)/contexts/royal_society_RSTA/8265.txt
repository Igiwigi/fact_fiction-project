the Zn maximum we have assumed that in solar type stars the material may be assumed
to be on the whole just once ionized ; alternatively, we have assumed that the mean
ionization potential of the material is of the order of the comparatively low first-stage
ionization potential of the metals. The results would require re-calculation should it be
found that there is, in solar stars, a considerable proportion of neutral atoms, e.g., atoms
of hydrogen.* ‘The average ionization-potential would then exceed that of the metals.

Neither of these classes of imperfections appear, however, to destroy the general
principles of the method. Accumulating measures of line-contours will ultimately
permit our provisional assumptions to be replaced by more accurate ones. The details
of the application of the method are flexible ; the method itself appears to the author to
remain valid. The advantage of the method of maxima is that it avoids any appeal to
a knowledge of the exact formula for the atomic scattering coefficient. In fact if the
chemical composition factors ¢ could be assumed known, the atomic scattering coeflicients
could themselves be determined from observed line-contours. Probably a complete
knowledge of all line-contours in a sufficient number of stars of known T and g would
provide more equations than unknowns—the unknowns being the <’s and the atomic
s,s. After that the method could be applied to determine g for stars of known T but
unknown g.

An important need at the moment is a mathematical treatment of the effect of selective
radiation-pressure in the transition region—the reversing layer. This would in effect
enable us to calculate effective gravity in terms of actual gravity and the atomic
scattering coefficients. The various unknowns will be entangled with one another
in increased complication. But this simply lends an increased attractiveness to the
