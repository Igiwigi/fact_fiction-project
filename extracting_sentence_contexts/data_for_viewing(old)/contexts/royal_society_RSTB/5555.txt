coefficients in different species of fungi this slight error becomes quite negligible in
comparing the respective respiration coefficients.

(2) Carbon as insoluble carbon compounds.—The only substance included in this
class which has so far been encountered is the mycelium of the fungus under observa-
tion. A little difficulty was experienced at first in separating satisfactorily the mycelium
from the metabolic products in solution. This was due to the fact that it was found
in earlier experiments that, when a mould mycelium is filtered through an ordinary
filter paper, it is impossible, after drying, to detach the mycelium and the accom-
panying spores in any quantitative fashion without detaching fibres of filter paper,
which vitiate the carbon figures obtained in the subsequent combustion of the mycelium.
In order to overcome this difficulty recourse was had to filtration through kieselguhr,
since the fact was established by experiment that, on drying a filter paper which has
been covered during filtration with a thin layer of kieselguhr, the latter peels off in a
layer without detaching any fibres from the paper.

The procedure adopted to separate the mycelium from the soluble metabolic products
is as follows :—

The metabolism flask F is detached from the apparatus and, after mycological
examination (see p. 17), the contents are neutralised to pH 7-0 with standard sodium
hydroxide (or hydrochloric acid), using bromthymol blue paper as an external indicator.
This titration gives the acid (or alkali) formed by the organism, since the titration value,
to the same pH, of the original medium is known. ‘The liquid is then filtered through
kieselguhr in the following way.
