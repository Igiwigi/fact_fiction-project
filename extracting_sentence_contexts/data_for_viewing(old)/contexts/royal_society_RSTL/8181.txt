Cor. 1f two conics S, 8' be 80 related that a triangle cireumscribed to 8 will be inseribed
in S', and if we reciprocate S with respect to S', the reciprocal conic S' will be related t0
S by the condition that any triangle inseribed iy S” will be SO In with respect to S.

319. From the values given (art. 317), we get cos =gt IE ; and since —a=F', we

have cos +4/F'=(b+c): 24/ —ade, with similar values for cos 9 -y/F, cos 6! SF
Hence we may write the equation of the conic $, which is the envelope of a line cut
harmonically by S, 8S' (see SALMON's © Conics,” p. 334), in the following manner ;—

This equation is altogether Wont having no reference to any particular system of
axes, being in fact true for any system whatever of trilinear axes.

Cor. 1. In like manner the equation of SaLMox's conic F, which is the locus of points
whence tangents to S, S' form an harmonic pencil, may be written in the form

x+F cos 0a*+x/F cos 0+ F" co88"2P. . . . . . . (199

Cor. 2. 'The discriminants of the covariant conics o, F are the quotient and product
of the expressions cos 9. cos 9, cos 8” and I. F.F.

Cor. 3. The reciprocal of $' with respect to F, that is, with respect to the conic (194),
is
