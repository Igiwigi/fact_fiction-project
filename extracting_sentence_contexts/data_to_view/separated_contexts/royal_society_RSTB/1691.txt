Fig. 184 from the next section shows the roots 3 and 4 in
obliquely longitudinal section, the plane of which passes through their central
cylinders. The vascular tissue of root 4 can here be traced through the cortex of the
â€˜stem. The great; interest of this series lies in the fact that it shows at one and the
same time the characteristic root-structure of these organs and their continuity as
_ endogenous appendages with the stem of Lyginodendron. Hi Tn order to bring out the point in question more clearly, we have figured one of the
roots on a larger scale (Plate 24, fig. 17). his is root 3 of figs. 18 and 18a. The
more magnified figure is taken from the third section of the series, in which this root
has become free from the stem, and is seen in complete transverse section.
