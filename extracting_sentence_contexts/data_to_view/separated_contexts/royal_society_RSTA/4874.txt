The particular mean field used can
lead to significant differences in results [23,100,101]. Possibly the most well-known solar wind
case concerns the energy spectrum and how the inertial range slope depends on the angle between
the measurement direction and the direction of Bo or Bic, No systematic difference in slopes is
seen when a global field is used, but steeper spectral slopes are seen at small angles when local
mean fields are employed (see [6] for a review). Note that wavelet ‘spectra’ computed relative to local mean fields are, in fact, not spectra in the
classical second-order moment sense [23]. Rather, because the direction of Bloc is itself a random
variable, wavelet ‘spectra’ also involve third- and higher-order correlations. Recall that the properties of linear wave modes are typically derived assuming a homogeneous
background with a mean magnetic field that is uniform and constant [126].
