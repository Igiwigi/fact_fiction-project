Brandis expedition to New Guinea [of 1928] all represent a form of Nicotiana tabacum
with relatively narrow, strongly petioled leaves. This is an inferior commercial type
closely approximating to the forms that first reached Europe as figured in some of the
Herbals published within the first century after Columbus’ voyages.

Lewis (19314, p. 136) gave a few dried native tobacco leaves from New Guinea to
Dr CG. F. Millspaugh, then curator of Botany in the Field Museum, Chicago, who
reported: ‘It is not possible to determine the species of the Nicotianae from leaves
alone....However I judge that the species you submit from Guinea is Nicotiana
suaveolens....My opinion that the species is N. suaveolens is based mostly on the fact
that that is the prevailing species cultivated in Africa (south) and on the islands
adjacent.’ Millspaugh evidently mistook New Guinea for the Guinea coast, and his
statement that N. suaveolens is cultivated in South Africa is entirely unsupported by
other writers. Laufer (1930, p. 3) refers to N. tabacum and N. rustica as the only species
of tobacco in Africa, where they were introduced from America.

In order to gain positive evidence concerning the species of the native tobacco,
I requested, in 1928, my friend Sir Hubert Murray, then Lieutenant-Governor of
Papua, to obtain specimens of the plants grown by the natives in widely separated
areas in order that they might be identified. Owing to his temporary absence from
Papua, he passed on my request to the Hon. H. W. Champion, the Government
Secretary, who at oncé enlisted the co-operation of numerous Government officials.
