In order that this may be a minimum for 6=0,
(A+a; P) must be zero, Similarly for (4+a; Q), (4+a; R),.... This proves the
first part of the theorem ; the second then follows from (I.).] Hence

(IV.) If the improved values of A and of B, using in each case the same set of
auxiliaries, are A+a and B+8, the m.pp.e. of A+a and B+, of A+a and B, and
of A and B+8, are all equal ; and

(V.) If the improved value of A, using certain auxiliaries, is A+a, and that of B,
using some only of these, is B+8, the m.p.e. of A+a and B+8 ts equal to that of
A+a and B.

(VL) If the improved value of A, using P, Q, R,... as auwiliaries, is
A+pP+qQ+rR+..., the values of p,q, ¥,... are given by a set of linear relations
between p, q, 1%, ... and the mpp.e. of A and P,Q, R,.... [The equations are given
by (III), viz., since (A+pP+qQ+7rh+...; P) = 0, &e.,

(A ; P)+p(P; P)+q(Q; P)+r(R; P)+... = 0,

(A; Q)+p(P; Q)+a(Q; Q+r(R; Q)+... = 0,

(4; R)+p(P; R)+q(Q; R)t+r(R; R)+... = 0,
&e. It is assumed that the determinant

is not zero; 2.e. (see § 2 (iii.)) that there is a set conjugate to P, Q, R, ....]

(VIL) For any particular set of auxiliaries there is one and only one improved
value of A. [This follows from the fact that the equations in (VI.), on the
assumption there stated, have one and only one solution.] Hence we get the
converse of (IIT.) :—

(VIIL) Jf x is the sum of w and a Le. of P, Q, R,..., and if the m.p.e. of x and
each of P, Q, R, ... is zero, then x is the improved value of w, using P, Q, BR, ... as
auxiliaries. As a particular case :—

(IX.) If the mp.e. of w and each of P, Q, R, ... is zero, the improved value of w,
using P, Q, R, ... as auxiliaries, is the same as the original value.

(X.) The improved value of P, using P, Q, R, ... as auxiliaries, is P—P = 0.
[This follows either from (VIII.) or from taking A = P in the equations in (VI.).]
Hence

(XL) If w is a Le. of A, B, C,... P,Q, R,..., the improved value of w, using
P, Q, R, ... as auviliaries, is the same as that of the quantity obtained by adding to
w any Le. of P, Q, R, ...; and, conversely :—

(XIL) If the improved values of w and of w’, using in each case the same set of
auxiliaries, are identical, then w and w' either are identical or differ by a lc. of the
auxiliaries.

(XIIL.) Jf the improved values of A, B, C,..., using in each case the same set of
