as to the number of seeds lies in the problematical structures at the apex, which are
very like aborted ovules at the tip of the cone. These are seen in Phot. 32, Plate 5,
and there the likeness to ovules which have been cut in oblique tangential section is
apparent. In this figure @ and b, which are distinct protuberances, are attached in a
central position on the upper part of the scale. At Â¢ the scale shows an irregularity
which may be a very tangential section of a third ovule.

In Phot. 33, Plate 5, is a high-power illustration of the supposed ovule a, which
shows the character and arrangement of the cells composing it. These resemble more
closely those found in a tangential section of an ovule than they do the mesophyll
tissue of a scale. The general tissues of this scale are not so mature and hardened,
nor is there the same development of vascular tissues as in the ripe scales from which
the seeds have fallen; facts which support the view that the structures under
discussion are aborted organs. Such aborted ovules not infrequently occur at the
tips of living cones, so that it is natural enough that they should be found in fossil
material.

While from their somewhat problematical nature these structures do not determine

the question of the number of seeds borne by each scale, yet they are not at variance
with, and indeed rather lend additional support to, the view that the number was
three, or at any rate not less than two.
