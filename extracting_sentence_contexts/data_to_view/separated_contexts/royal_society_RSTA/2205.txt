Thus,
setting the functions f(n) and y(n) allows defining a wider class of raising and lowering operators
than that of using an adjoint condition.

3. Arbitrary operators in Fock space

Any operator W acting on basis |”) can be expanded with respect to the basis |1). In fact, the result of the action of the operator W on the basis |1) can be expanded with respect
to the basis |)

Win) = >> walk), (3.1)
k

where w,, are the decomposition coefficients. Then, taking into account (2.1), the operator W can be formally represented as

Wd) wank) (al. (3.2)

In particular, there is a linear operator A which acts on the basis |n), such that
A\n) =ay|n). (3.3)

Thus, the value ay, is an eigenvalue of the operator A, while the vector |) is the corresponding
eigenfunction (eigenvector) of this operator. Taking into account (3.2), the operator A can be formally represented as

A= Jo ayln) (nl. (3.4)

Taking into account (2.5)-(2.7), the raising and lowering operators can also be formally
decomposed with respect to the basis |n): at = >, f(k)|k + 1)(k| anda =>, y(|k — 1) (kl .
