not of such a nature as to offer any explanation of the difference between the effects
on the entire animal, which the anaphylatoxin kills, in some instances, in a dose as

little as 0°5 c.c., while the normal serum produces practically no symptoms in ten

times that dose. The activity of the anaphylatoxin on the plain muscle may be twice
or thrice that of the normal serum ; certainly it is not more.

While the action of this preparation on plain muscle is under discussion, we may
recall the fact that FrrepBerGer (32) himself has tested it in this way. He found
that it stopped the activity of an isolated slip of intestinal muscle, and argued, some-
what surprisingly, that this represents the true anaphylactic reaction, while the
contraction of the isolated anaphylactic uterus in response to its antigen has not this
significance, because the muscle is stimulated and not killed. We have failed to
confirm FRrEDBERGER’S observation. In our experiments the bacterial anaphylatoxin
had a moderate, though not in our opinion very significant, stimulating action on
intestinal as on uterine muscle (see fig. 5). We entirely fail to understand his
argument. It is the animal, not its plain muscle, which dies in anaphylactic shock,
and contraction of plain muscle is, in the guinea-pig, the cause of death. Our records
of effects on plain muscle with the anaphylatoxin are less incompatible with its
supposed connection with anaphylaxis than are FrrepBERGER’S own ; but for quanti-
tative reasons we conclude that this direct action on the plain muscle does not
