It therefore seems probable that the new centre of P,
exerted a repulsive effect on J,. This effect, however, cannot have lasted as long as in
a normal leaf, since the centre of J, was close above the centre of P,, the angle /—J, being

170° and 167° in the two experiments. The fact that /, occupies the smaller angle P,-J,
in both these experiments raises the question whether any leaf other than the regenerated
P, and J, was effective in determining J,. It is suggested that P, was effective in doing so, since
its centre lies on the same side of the apex as the larger angle between P, and J, (figure 7B,
no. 9). Ps would thus play the same part in these experiments in determining J, as did P, in
three experiments of group I (nos. 3, 7 and 8) in determining J,, for in both experiments
a leaf arose in the smaller angle between the last two leaves, and the centre of a leaf four
plastochrons older (P, or P3) lay beneath the larger angle, while the centre of the leaf
(P, or P,) underlying the smaller angle had been removed.
