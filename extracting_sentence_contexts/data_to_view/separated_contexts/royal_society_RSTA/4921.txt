Bris is the equation to a parabola. €The curves of the first singular system are hyperbolas, having their asymptotes

Parallel to the axes of coordinates and having contact of the second order with this
abola. — The complete primitive represents a series of parabolas with axes parallel to

he axis of y, and each having contact of the second order with some one of the

perbolas, and, in fact, with two of them, since « is given in terms of and ¢ by a
= equation. iB § 57. In order to make up further examples we only need to take :—
