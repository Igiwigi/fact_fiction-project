Or, if the division of ages is identical, but the two
data refer to different periods of time ? And besides, after all such really existing difficulties, if we finally succeed in —
calculating some natalities, we obtain but half-a-dozen natal probabilities, so that in —
face of the hundreds and thousands of probabilities contained in a complete table,
those poor results cannot claim to be placed on the same level, to be regarded in
general as tables of natality. The indifference with which this important question has
been treated is proved best by the fact, that even in those few cases where it would
be possible to calculate some monogenous probabilities, this calculation has often been
quite omitted. As will be seen in the following pages, hitherto not a single specified
bigenous, and not even a single specified male table of natality has been produced. What we possess is only one specified table for the female (Berlin), whilst a second
