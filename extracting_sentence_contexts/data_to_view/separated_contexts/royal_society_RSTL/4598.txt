In order that the quintic may have two pairs of equal roots, or that the system
of roots may be 221, the simplest type to be considered is
14.15.24.25.34.35.45;
a type which gives the function

E(,—d)(»—2)(B—3(B—5(7—2(y—9)(—#)((x—ay)(a—ByY (av)
This is a covariant of the degree 5 in the coefficients and of the degree 9 in the variables;
but it appears from the memoir above referred to, that there is not any irreducible
covariant of the form in question ; such covariant must be a swm of the products
(No. 13)(No. 20), (No. 13)(No. 14)?, (No. 15)(No. 16) (the numbers refer to the Cova-
riant Tables given in the 'memoir), each multiplied by a merely numerical coefficient.
'These numerical coefficients may be determined by the consideration that there being two
pairs of equal roots, we may by a linear transformation make these roots 0, 0, oo, oo,
or what is the same thing, we may write a=b=e=j=0, the covariant mnst then
vanish identically. The coefficients are thus found to be 1, —4, 50, and we have for a
covariant vanishing in the case of two pairs of equal roots,
1 (No. 13)(No. 20)

— 4 (No. 13)(No. 14}

+50 (No. 15)(No. 16). In fact, writing a=b=e=f=0, and rejecting, where it occurs, a factor 2%, the several
covariants become functions of ca, dy; and putting, for shortness, &, y instead of ca, dy.
the equation to be verified is

1.10(z+y)(6a%+ 84% +282%*+ 8xy* + 637)
— 4.10(z+y)(8a*+2xy +39)
+50(6a*+8ay+ 64?) (a*+a% +297 +5) =0.

and this gives the function


SYSTEMS OF EQUALITIES AMONG THE ROOTS OF AN EQUATION. 731

And dividing out by (z+y) and reducing, the equation is at once seen to be identically
true.

11. In order that the quintic may have three equal roots, or that the system of roots
may be of the form 311, the simplest type to be considered is

12.13.23.45;
E(a—P)(BÞ—YY(y—«Y(3—e8)%,

which being an invariant, and being of the fourth degree in the coefficients, must be
the quartinvariant of the quintic. The same type gives also the function
E(#—PY(B—v)(y—o)(3—2)(a—dy)(a— ey),
Awhich is a covariant of the degree 4 in the coefficients and the degree 4 in the variables ;
QGand it must vanish when a=b=c=0, this can only be the covariant
E 3(No. 20)—2(No. 14),
Syhich it is clear vanishes as required.
