Regarding Central Australia, Mr. MITCHELL publishes extremely valuable tables of
observations, from which we learn that, when the days are at the same time calm and
clear, the daily thermometric range is exceedingly large. The temperature at noon being
68? on the 2nd of March 1835, that at sunrise next morning was 20*, showing a differ-
ence of 48%. The 7th and 8th were also clear and calm; the difference between noon
and sunrise on the former day was 38?, while on the latter it was 41%. Indeed between
April and September a range of 40* in clear weather was quite common—or more than
double the amount which it is in London at the corresponding season of the year.

A freedom of escape similar to that from bodies at great elevations would occur at
any other level were the vapour removed from the air above it. Hence the withdrawal
of the sun from any region over which the atmosphere is dry, must be followed by quick
refrigeration. This is simply an @ priori conclusion from the facts established by expe-
riment; but I believe all the experience of meteorology confirms it. The winters in
Tibet are almost unendurable from this cause. The isothermals dip deeply from the
north into Central Asia during the winter, the earth's heat being wasted without impe-
diment in space, and no sun existing sufficiently powerful to make good the loss. T
believe the fact is well established that the desert of Sahara, which during the day is
burning hot, is often extremely cold at night. This effect has been hitherto referred in
a general way to the © purity of the air;” but purity, as judged by the eye, is a yery
imperfect test of radiation, for the existence of large quantities of vapour is consistent
with a transparent atmosphere. The purity really consists im the absence of aqueous
vapour from those s0-called rainless districts, which, when the sun is withdrawn, enables
the hot surface of the earth to run speedily down to a freezing temperature.
