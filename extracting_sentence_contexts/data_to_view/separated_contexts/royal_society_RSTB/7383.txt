Rising phyllotaxis will not be reflected here in a change in the number of con-
spicuous parastichies, but it will alter the angle of intersection in the 2:2 spiral system. The
relation between this angle and phyllotaxis index is not entirely without interest, and will
be elucidated in the following paragraphs, especially as its inclusion completes the survey
undertaken in earlier sections. These various systems from which ‘rising’ phyllotaxis (in the usually accepted sense) is
excluded, all derive geometrically from the fact that a new primordium always appears in
a position bisecting angles between the primordia of the preceding whorl; even in the
alternate arrangement the new member may be regarded as bisecting the 360° angle round
the whole apex terminated in either direction by the centre of the preceding primordium. It follows that the leaves produced at any node are orthostichous with those separated from
them by two, four, etc., internodes. All these phyllotaxis systems are then essentially
