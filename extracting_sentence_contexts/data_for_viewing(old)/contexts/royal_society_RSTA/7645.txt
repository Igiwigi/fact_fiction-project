ment of the pen in its spiral path varies as it moves from near the centre outwards, and
its mean speed is 5 mm./min.

In an instrument provided by Dr Jaccar, by reducing the moment of inertia of
the balance wheel of the clock movement, and by alterations to the gearing, the
speed of rotation of the “hour” spindle has been increased five times. The increased
time scale which is thus provided can be of considerable value. An example of two
records obtained at Olveston with this instrument is included in fig. 4, and it will be
seen that the distance between the successive lines of the spiral has been much reduced
in comparison with that in the other instruments, from 3-0 to 0-7 mm., by altering the
diameter of the driving rollers which provide the lateral movement of the clock. It
will be seen that the deflected trace described by the pen during an earthquake has a
slight wavering appearance, and this is due in some measure to the fact that the hour
spindle of the clock does not move smoothly, but in jerks as a consequence of the
escapement mechanism. It’should be noticed that the recording is unaffected by the
closeness of the lines. In some circumstances it might be of great advantage to have
recording of this type, either for obtaining a more extended time scale as in the present
instance, or alternatively, using the more usual time scale, to provide an instrument in
which the record needs to be changed only once in 4 or 5 days. With such a design it
becomes possible to maintain instruments in operation in places which are not easily
accessible.

The Kew-Jagger vertical shock recorder, fig. 2, is similar in design to the horizontal
instrument. The weight of the bob is taken by a long spring of invar metal, the distance
of the bob from the clamps being maintained by thinner springs than in the case of the
