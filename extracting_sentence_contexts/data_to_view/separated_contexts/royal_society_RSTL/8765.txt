Others had semilunar lacunz like those of fig. 1, whilst others were 80 exceedingly large
and irregular as to form a cavity entirely surrounding the vascular bundle. One of these
irregular orifices is seen in fig. 7, c, &; and on comparing it with the small gum-canals
(ce, c) in the same figure it becomes obvious that they are different structures. These
and other similar facts led me to distrust my first conclusions, and made it probable that
these open passages were rather spaces caused by the detachment of the vascular bundles
from the surrounding cellular tissne, snch as we frequently observe in sections of the
recent Lycopods. Further studies of these sections led me to conclude that the expla-
nation may be found in a combination of these hypotheses. Thus in fig. 8, e we have
an unmistakable gum-canal associated with the large bundle represented there.
