sporogenous.* Thus, though examples are not common, it may be concluded that among
vascular plants, ceils which are normally sterile may occasionally develop into spores.

Comparing the results of our inquiry for Vascular Plants with those from
Bryophyta, we find in both evidence of sterilisation, with, conversely, occasional
reversion of cells normally sterile to spore-production. So that putting together the
converse conclusions, and remembering at the same time the fact that in some cases
the sporogenous groups are very ill-defined, i¢ may be stated generally for the sporophyte
of Archegoniate plants, that spore-production is not in all cases strictly limited to,
or defined by pre-ordained formative cells, or cell-groups. This position, based as
it is on the facts observed, is one which harmonises readily with a theory of sterilisation,
as applied to the evolution of the sporophyte.

VorcuttxG has formulated the proposition that “no living vegetative cell of the
plant-body, which is capable of growth, has a specific and unalterable function.”+
This thesis in its most general sense should be extended so as to include also
sporogenous cells ; for, as we have seen, many cases can be cited of the conversion of
cells which are sporogenous to a vegetative condition, and occasionally the converse.
But both VorcurinG, and Prerrer.{ in discussing this equipotentiality of embryonic
