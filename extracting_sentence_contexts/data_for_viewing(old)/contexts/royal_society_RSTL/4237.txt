I may here state, that to ensure the purity of the wax used in the following experi-
ments, I prepared it myself from the comb. It was made by bees in the county of
Surrey in the years 1845 and 1846. This wax I have always used for the first prepa-
ration of a snbstance. For further experiment I have sometimes used wax procured
in other ways.

Cerotic Acid.

If wax melting at about 62* or 63* Centigrade be treated with boiling alcohol, a
considerable portion will be dissolved. If this operation be repeated, the quantity of
substance dissolved the fifth or sixth time will he evidently less than that dissolved
in the first operation. But however often this operation be repeated, there will
always be a portion of wax dissolved. This fact alone might lead us to suspect that
any absolute separation of these two portions of the wax, by boiling with alcohol and
subsequent crystallization ont of that liquid, was impossible.

A partial separation can, however, be readily effected, and by this method a sub-

stance can be obtained melting at 70* and even 72 Centigrade, much harder than
the residue of the wax, brittle, and slightly crystalline in its structure. If this 8ub-
stance be boiled with a solution of caustic potash, it is saponified with the greatest,
facility. If the soap be decomposed by an acid, a baryta salt formed of the acid
