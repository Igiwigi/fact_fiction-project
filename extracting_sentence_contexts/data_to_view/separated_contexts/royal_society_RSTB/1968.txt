inference, the period required for spore-formation, is dependent upon temperature,
and, furthermore, that the optimum is probably nearer 30° C. than 20°C. As to the
minimum temperature at which growth occurs, the following facts are of interest,
though they are not conclusive.

Growth Curves plotted from Tables I, II, and IIT. It has been already stated that an effective means of delaying germination and
2 growth consists in placing cultures at a temperature of 10° C.; this fact was
= repeatedly taken advantage of in my observations on germination. Tt was also very
= noticeable that with the approach of cold weather the organism developed much
more slowly in cultures kept at the rather low temperature of the laboratory, and
also that, under these conditions, instead of producing spores in great abundance in
the course of a few days, the individual rods became swollen and transformed into
most remarkable involution forms. During the early part of December, the exception-
ally warm weather which had prevailed continuously, suddenly changed, and for two
nights the ground froze to the depth of about an inch, Attempts to secure a fresh
supply of the organism from the soil after this cold spell either failed entirely, or
resulted in the very slow formation, on plates of saccharose-gelatine of pearly, drop-
like colonies, identical in appearance with those obtained during warmer weather,
but consisting almost entirely of involution forms.
