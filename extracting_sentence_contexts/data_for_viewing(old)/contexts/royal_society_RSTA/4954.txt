lemma [2, lemma 3.3]:


Lemma 6.2. For a separable polynomial f € E[x], denote by 5x(f) the square class of its discriminant
disc,(f) in the F-vector space EX /(EX)°. The square classes 5x(F),...,5 (Fr) are linearly independent.

The lemma is proved using some of the arguments from [1]. It then sets the ground for the
application of a final lemma [7, lemma 3.4]:

Lemma 6.3. If the square classes 5y(F),...,6x(Fr) are linearly independent, then Fy,...,Fy are
linearly disjoint over E.

Lemma 6.3, together with F being the compositum of Fy,...,F, and with the classical fact that
Gal (F;/E) = Sn, easily yields proposition 6.1; see [2, §3] for the full details.

We note that lemma 6.3 was proved in [7] also in characteristic 2. In this case, 5x(f) needs to
be defined in terms of Berlekamp’s discriminant, as the residue class [Berl(f)] in E/g(E), where
@(y) =y? + y. We shall prove lemma 6.2 in this context, for 1 > 2, in analogy to the proof in [2].
This is the last required piece in the proof of proposition 6.1 for characteristic 2.

Proof. Consider an arbitrary extension Fy, write t=Up and consider specializations
(Un...) Un 1) a= (1.01) ER. The specialization of the polynomial F is f =x" +
Qy1x" 14... +ayx+te Fye[x, t]. E/@(E) is specialized into Fy (t)/s(F,(t)), and we shall work
in this quotient. Examine the proof of proposition 3.3. In its course we have in fact shown that if
[Berl(f + @1)] 40 (i.e. a ¢ An UC(1)), and discx(f + a1) is coprime to discx(f + aj) for each j #1 (i.e.
