jacent country might be insufficient to furnish food for the immense number of
young ones that must burst forth at the same time.

finishes this business in 'a shorter space of time than any

other bird, but as he deviates 80 widely from the common

laws of the feathered society, I shall select the s8wift, as a

better example for pointing out the fact. The swift shows

himself here about the beginning of May (sometimes a few

stragglers appear earlier) and by the beginning of August
he has completely reared his young ones, which seldom con-
sist of more than two. At once the old birds and their family
take their leave and are seen no more for that season. Now
his farther residence cannot be rendered unpleasant by any
disagreeable change in the temperature of the air, or from-a
scarcity of his common food, which at this time abounds in
the greatest plenty. This circumstance of the early depar-
ture of the swift, without a more apparent cause, seems to
