with that of the Septocoral/ia in the main, but the axes are lens-shaped, the groups
of calcification centres elongate, and the arrangement of the fibres assumes in conse-
quence more the appearance of bisymmetry than of radial symmetry in transverse
sections. Nevertheless, the trahecule are really grouped, and the fascicles have a
very distinct character, the primary part of the deposit near the origin of the fascicle
showing crystalline fibres set rectangularly to the axis, while as the deposit is farther
remote from the origin the crystalline fibres become more and more oblique in their
setting. And it is this very principle, together with the lens-like form of the axes
which produces in transverse section of an Eupsammid septum the appearance of an
inner and outer septal deposit on both sides of the mid-line. No doubt this kind of
appearance gave rise to the idea ofa four-leaved septum held by some paleontologists.
But these are appearances shown only by particular sections, and owe their explana-
tion to the facts I have just indicated.

If I were to go on appearances, I might say all septa in which the trabecular axes
are lens-like in shape and close together, appear to be at least two-leaved in
transverse sections, in some cases four-leaved, Whereas all septa in which the
trabecular axes are thread-like or rod-like in shape, and are not very close, appear
to be a single-leaf in transverse section, in some cases three-leaved (i.c., where the
deposit near the origin of fascicles differs in its crystalline setting from the deposit
more remote). But these appearances cannot lead with any security to a systematic
analysis of corals.

Thus, one must not be deceived by the appearances of Eupsammid transverse
sections. The affinity of this family is undoubtedly rather with the Astreide and
