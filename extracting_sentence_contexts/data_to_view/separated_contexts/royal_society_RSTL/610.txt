146 Count RumForD's Enquiry concerning the Nature of Heat,

And, if of the total quantity of heat which passed off through
the bottom of the conical instrument No.6, = 9954, a quantity
==9597 passed off through the air, in calorific rays, the remainder
only, (9954 â€” 9597,) which amounts to no more than gz7 parts,
could have been communicated to the air,

Hence it would appear, that when a hot body is cooled in
air, ;- part only of the heat which it loses is acquired by the air;
for 957 is to 9597, as 1 to 27, very nearly. But I shall refrain
from enlarging farther on this subject at present. One of the objects which I had in view, in the last experi-
ment, was, to find out whether the cooling of a hot body in air,
is or is not sensibly accelerated, or retarded, by the greater or
lesser distance at which the body is placed from other neigh-
bouring solid bodies, when these neighbouring bodies are at the
same temperature as the air; and, as a comparison of the result
of this experiment, with the results of the two preceding experi-
ments, 80 strongly indicated that the cooling of the conical
vessel, in the preceding experiments, had in fact been retarded
by the vicinity of the pewter platter over which it was suspended,
I was now-induced-to repeat these experiments with some
variations. Y b These investigations appeared to- me to be: of the more im-
portance, as I conceived that the results of them might lead to
a discovery of one of the causes of the warmth of clothing.
