It would appear from these and similar results obtained with mercuric fulminate
that the amount of the latter required to induce detonation of the same substance,
under the conditions described, is generally in direct proportion to the length and
diameter of the tube through which detonation is transmitted, except when its length
is 80 reduced as probably to bring the fulminate operated upon within the range of the
flash of fire, as well as of the blow given by the initiative exploston.

d. Experiments with mercuric fulmindte and gun-cotton.

It was shown by me, in 'my former memoir on Explosive Agents*, that 0:32 grm.
(5 grains) of fulminate, enclosed in a thin metal case, was required to develop the deto-
nation of compressed gun-cotton, care being taken to secure close contact between it
and the detonator. In accordance with the fact demonstrated in that memoir, that the
sharpness of a detonation and its consequent power of developing detonation in other
masses was dependent upon the degree of confinement or the strength of the enyelope
enclosing the explosive substance, I havye since found that only 2 grains (0:13 grm.) of
the fulminate are required to detonate compressed gun-cotton with certainty, provided
the case in which it is enclosed be constructed of stout metal (sheet iron), the 'detonator
being 80 applied as to be closely surrounded by the mass to be detonated (7. e. inserted
into a perforation in the piece of compressed gun-cotton). If there is not close contact
between the two, a considerable larger proportion of the fulminate, confined as aboye
described, is needed to ensure detonation; and in actual practice, when it may fre-
quently be difficult to ensure close contact of the detonator with eyen some small
portion of the charge to be exploded, it is found advisable to use about 1 gramme
(15:45 grains) of the fulminate in the detonating fuse.
