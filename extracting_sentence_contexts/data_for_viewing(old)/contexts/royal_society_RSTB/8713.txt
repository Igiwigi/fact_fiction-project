purposes. Being a bodily self requires distinctive biological
features inanimate objects are patently devoid of. That said,
it should be added that it is just because of neural reuse
and ES that the space around us and the objects populating
it are constituted as the horizon of our motor potentialities.
As aptly put by Merleau-Ponty, our body ‘provides us with
a way of access to the world and the object, with a praktog-
nosia, which has to be recognized as original and perhaps
as primary’ ([97], p.140)

A similar argument can be used to address the apparent
contradiction between the proposed centrality of action in gen-
erating the bodily self by means of ES and the fact that ES also
applies to emotions and sensations. Centrality does not actu-
ally mean sufficiency. I would rather propose that action is
necessary but not sufficient to generate a full-blown bodily
self. As argued in the Introduction and as testified by empirical
evidence, the motor aspects of the bodily self enable the inte-
gration of self-related multimodal sensory information about
the body and about the world the body interacts with. It is
also worth noting that emotions are motorically expressed
and, when observed, they may generate motor resonance in
the beholder, both at the levels of the face and body. Further-
more, the fact that somatosensory areas, such as SI and SII,
show evidence of ES during the first-person experience of
