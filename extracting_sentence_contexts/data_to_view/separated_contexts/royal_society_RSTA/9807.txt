The Lenard effect would come into play when the drops splashed on
the water in the box, but as all the electricity separated remained within the tray
and its lid, this effect could cause no charging of the system. If, however, the drops
had fallen with a charge on them it would have been detected by a deflection of the
electrometer. No such effect could be observed.

(c) In order to prevent the Lenard effect from coming into play when the drops
fell into the tray after breaking up on the air jet, use was made of the fact discovered
by Lenarp that the splashing of salt water produces the opposite charge to that
