(2) Heterogeneity of the substitution rate across sites. Following
the seminal observations of Uzzell & Corbin [41], various
methods have been developed to handle the fact that
some sites are more susceptible than others to accumu-
late substitutions, and thus to generate artefacts. The
gamma distribution appears as a good compromise
between computational efficiency and biological realism.
That is why it is now widely used. More refined models
(such as mixture of gamma or Dirichlet processes) might
nevertheless prove to be useful for solving difficult
questions.

(3) Heterogeneity of the substitution process across sites. The fact
that only a few amino acids are possible at a given pos-
ition (e.g. charged or hydrophobic amino acids) was
established by biochemists a long time ago, but it has
attracted the attention of phylogeneticists only recently
[42,43]. This is surprising because the efficiency of the
detection of multiple substitutions is much higher
when the number of possible character states is reduced
[25]. CAT-like models [43] use a Dirichlet process to affili-
ate individual sites to different CATegories defined by
their character state frequencies. With hundreds to thou-
sands of categories usually inferred in a_ posteriori
analyses, the observed heterogeneity is very high,
