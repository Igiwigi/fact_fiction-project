This effect may be imitated by preparing a collodion film with a
“grating” that gives a good spectrum. If, now, a few drops of an alcoholic solution
of an aniline dye are run on the film, so that it is rapidly absorbed without affecting the
surface in any way, the colour is seen to disappear, or to become very much reduced
in intensity, especially in the region of the spectrum corresponding to the dye used. It might be expected that colour would be seen in white or light scales, and this, as a
matter of fact, does sometimes occur. Moreover, when pale scales are looked at under
the microscope with oblique illumination, a faint pink and greenish sheen, somewhat
like mother-of-pearl, is nearly always observed, In perfectly transparent scales definite
spectra sometimes appear, as may be demonstrated by the following experiment. A
collodion impression is made with Morpho achilles, Luxn., which has a layer of trans-
parent, striated scales, care being taken to insure that one or two patches of these
blue scales become detached and adhere to the collodion.
