In the Chameleon, Scincidee, Tejidee, Varanidee, Zonuride, and in the Iguanide, the
& _ pupil is invariably circular. In the Geckos it is likewise round, but closes to a vertical
N slit; in most species I have examined, e.g., Fringed Gecko (Pachydactylus maculatus),
S ‘Turkish Gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus) and Cocteau’s Gecko (H. coctean?), it closes to a
g vertical slit, but this slit is not a straight line, as in the domestic cat, but is interrupted
2 by four, five or even more minute equidistant pinholes, or notches, so as to just permit
S a small amount of diffracted rays from direct sunlight to penetrate their eyes. The
6 fact that these creatures are nocturnal hunters, and therefore extremely sensitive to
po bright light, affords a ready explanation for this modification of their pupils under the
co action of bright sunshine, in which they frequently bask. It is therefore all the more
‘4 _ interesting that in the Green Gecko (Hemidactylus viridis), a species which, by the way, is
‘¢ _— undoubtedly diurnal, the pupil remains circular, while sunlight and drugs hardly, if
& at all, affect it. COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE REPTILIAN AND THE AMPHIBIAN EYE.
