of the pit-membrane has occurred, and that the membrane is extremely thin. In
some of the pits small masses of protoplasm may be recognised sticking to the pit-
membrane, being brought into view in consequence of their brown staining reaction.
The pit-membrane is well stained by methylene blue. Scarcely any difference can be
detected between the thickness of the cell-walls on the upper and under sides of the
pulvinus. Except just beneath the epidermis, and next the vazscular bundle, the cells
are relatively large. The layer of protoplasm (primordial utricle) lining the cell-wall
is thin, and the central vacuole is large. In consequence of this, very great shrinking
of the protoplasm is possible, and experience shows that the 8nccessful preservation of
this tissue is extremely difficult. Any reagents causing the least diffusion very 800n
affect the protoplasm, and the only at all successful treatment is brought about by

* Tho fact deserves notice that in the cases where the protoplagm displays* any great activity of
function, the cells of s8nch a tissue usually contain tannin. For example, pulyini of Mimosa Robinia,
Desmodium, &e., leaf of Dioncea, Drosera. Again in galls, where a stimulation of the protoplasm
followed by rapid growth occurs. Notice that in Robinia it is the pulvini of the leaflets that move more
than the main pulyinus, which have the greater quantity of tannin. The effect of tannin in producing
aggregation is dealt with by A. F, W. Scutyer (Bot. Zeit.,' 14, 1882) On Tannin. See also
