It was shown that the rotation angles were exponentially sensitive to
he exact values of the magnetic field strengths. In other words, it was a purely
quantum system showing exponential sensitivity, in principle, characteristic of
nonlinear classical problems. The whole discussion was raised [48,49] owing
o the fact that, in the classical parlance, exponential sensitivity owing to
nonlinearities is related to the initial conditions. However, in the mentioned
example, the sensitivity is associated with the system parameters and not with the
initial preparation of the system, namely the starting wave function. So, strictly
speaking, this system is not chaotic in the classical sense.
