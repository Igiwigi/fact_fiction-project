o = 5.624, K = 1.406, d= 0.1.

Here o =3aNÂ°/?/4 characterizes conservative nonlinearity, and d= VNky/4, dissipative terms.
Considering the reduced system, we illustrate the evolution of the regime of intense energy beats
which appears as a limit cycle (red bold line) on the phase planes of figure 9(a(i-iii)). In spite of
the fact that the LPT has its special geometrical meaning solely for the two-oscillator, conservative
models or externally loaded single d.f. models, we will refer to the limit cycles obtained in the
present model as the LPT limit cycles due to their correspondence to the LPT of the conservative
subsystem in the limit of zero dissipation.

The LPT limit cycle emerges for some low values of nonlinear and dissipation parameters
of the system. It encircles one of the stationary points (unstable simple periodic regime of the
full system (3.30)) at (7/4, 32/2). In fact, for the lower values of dissipation and nonlinearity
(figure 9a(i-iii)), the stable LPT limit cycle corresponds to the intense (nearly complete) energy
exchange between the axial and the lateral vibrations of the outer element of the full model (3.30).
When the parameters of dissipation d and/or nonlinearity k are gradually increased, the form of
the LPT limit cycle on the phase plane is being deformed, while it still remains the only stable
attractor of the system. At some point the two pairs of stationary points appear within the LPT
point. If the parameters k and/or d are further increased, the saddle eventually collides with the
stable LPT limiting cycle and the LPT limit cycle vanishes (figure 9(a(iv))). In figure 9(b), we plot
the comparison of the beating regime of the full model (3.30) with that of the reduced asymptotic
ones (3.34).
