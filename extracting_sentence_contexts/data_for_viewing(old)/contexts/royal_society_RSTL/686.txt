Like the atmosphere, the ocean is subject to irregularities
of temperature. This fact is proved by the Journal in an
ample manner. The causes which produce these irregula-
rities may be divided, very generally, into three kinds, tem-
pestuous weather, shoals, and currents.

Independent of other modes of operation, and they are
various in tempestuous weather, superficial currents appear
to be established in the course of the prevailing winds. If
the wind be from a cold quarter, the temperature of this cur-
rent is comparatively low, and vice vers. This fact is mani-
fest in the effect of the gales we experienced between the
7th and 12th of April, during which time, being south of the


286 Dr. Davy's observations on the

equator, and the wind blowing from the south, the tempera-
ture of the sea was considerably reduced.

Where the sea is shallow, it is now a well established fact,*
that the temperature of the water is comparatively low ; an
important circumstance, highly deserving the attention of the
