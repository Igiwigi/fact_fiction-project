which yields again (3.7). In conclusion, as far as the description of the emergence of polarization
switch is concerned the Ochrombel-type simplification (2.6) retains all the essential features of the
more elaborated two-against-one model (2.4).

4. Additional considerations

(a) Asymptotic opinion distributions

The two-against-one model produces mf% = sgn(m)y-), hence, independently of the polarization
switch, only three values are possible for the asymptotic mean opinion: mj =—1, 0, 1. In
particular, we observe that my; =0 arises only if mvc =0 and that the latter is an unstable
equilibrium of the product moment myc, cf. (3.5). As a matter of fact, the relevant physically
observable cases are therefore mj; = +1, which identify a consensus in the social network with
asymptotic opinion distribution
h*(w) = 8(w + 1).
Conversely, the Ochrombel-type simplification produces my = mc /mc € [-1, 1], which need

not imply an asymptotic consensus because mj; may be in principle any value in the interval
[-1, 1]. A simple computation shows that the asymptotic variance owe of the opinion is
