Since B3(y) ~ ,/Iy|, typically vey will be O(1) as t — ov. In figure 3b, the distributions of log, yyy
are plotted; in contrary to figure 3a, these distributions are slowly shifting towards 0, and 0 is
within their supports.

We next look at fi; = f44(Xm(t) +-), the endpoint polymer distribution centred at the point
of maximum density X(t). We conjecture that as t—> oo, the distribution of ji; will converge
to some random probability distribution on Z, i.e. a random non-negative vector in ['(Z). In
figure 4, the distributions of /1+({—1})//11({0}) and fir({—2})//4+({0}) are plotted. In the figures, these
distributions tend to stabilize as n increases, which supports this conjecture.

We denote by yz the limiting random probability measure on Z. To explain the observed fact
of typically large values of the quenched variance shown in figure 3a, one can think of two
possibilities. The first one corresponds to the situation when the random probability measure
u has finite variance, while in the second case the variance is infinite. Since fit is centred at the
point of maximum density, the behaviour of the second moment is not that different from that of
the variance. In what follows, we will switch to the discussion of the second moments of /i+ as it
is easier to study numerically in the simulations.

In the first case when ju typically has finite second moment, it is possible that fi; has the
decomposition
