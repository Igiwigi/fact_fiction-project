where 7, and @, are polar co-ordinates measured from y = 0, x = &. The integral in (68)
conyerges for any given value of @, in the range 0<0,<7. Its formal expression at J, = 0
(or 7), which is (66), may be defined as the limit when /,— 0 (or 7). Alternatively, con-
vergence at (, = 0, 7 can be obtained by a permissible distortion of the path C. Thus (68)

reduces to —1kZI.(E) dED(k | x—E |) (69)

on the interface y = 0. The corresponding expression for £, at y = 0 due to a current sheet
occupying y = 0, x>0 is obtained from (69) by integrating over from 0 to. In order to
satisfy the boundary conditions on the perfectly conducting plate, this value of /, must be
equated (for x>0) to that of — Ei at y = 0; the result is the integral equation (67). Equation
(67) is of the type susceptible to the method of Wiener & Hopf (Titchmarsh 1937). The
Wiener-Hopf procedure would be facilitated by the fact that the kernel (4 |x—&€|) is
defined as a Fourier integral in (66), but this really emphasizes the irrelevance of bringing
) into the analysis and indicates that the dual integral equations offer a more direct line
of attack.

Another slightly different formulation of the problem may be devised. So far we have
considered the complete field in terms of a ‘correction’ to the field existing in the absence
of the perfectly conducting sheet. Now let us consider it in terms of a ‘correction’ to the
field which would exist were the conducting sheet infinite instead of semi-infinite. This
alternative approach (associated when x= 1 with the exact electromagnetic form of
Babinet’s principle) indeed yields slightly simpler integral equations than those given above,
owing to the fact that we are dealing with a vertically polarized field; on the other hand,
the new ‘correction’ field has no obvious physical interpretation. If, then, the whole plane
