The insets, A and B, also include diagrammatic sections of
these two regions of the wing. Defined in terms of the axes, X, Y and Z, the plane of the
wing-surface is the X, Y plane; a transverse section of the wing is a section in the Y, Z plane;
a longitudinal section is a section in the X, Z plane. The figure also records the fact that the
scales are bristle-like on the anterior and posterior margins, paddle-shaped on the lateral
margin and typically flattened on the body of the wing. The regions A and B are viewed
along the Z axis, normal to the wing-surface. The stippled area to the right of the rudiments
in B is the marginal zone of the pupal wing.
