With the exception of four individuals,
which were examined before they had fed, all these leeches were allowed to remain
for a varying number of days after their first feed, in order to permit the flagellates,
if any were present, to develop and multiply ; some specimens were kept till after
their second clean feed. Neither trypanosomes nor trypanoplasms ever appeared in
any of these control leeches. This result, taken in conjunction with the precisely
similar experience of Brumpr(1), who carried out analogous experiments with over
a hundred young individuals of this species, seems to establish the fact that, in the
case of Hemiclepsis marginata, trypanosomes and trypanoplasms are not transmitted
