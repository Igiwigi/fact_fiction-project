different from that due to the impact of the same sphere when rough or wet, and it is
a matter of great interest to find that the difference is quite pronounced from the first
instant of contact.

Series IV. (Plate 4) gives, in 17 photographs, the splash of a well-polished sphere
of ivory, 1°9 centim, in diameter, falling 60 centims. into water mixed with milk, con-
tained in a glass bowl about 1 foot deep and 9 inches in diameter (scale $ linear). In
order to secure that the splash shall follow the lines here recorded, the polishing with
a dry cloth or wash-leather must be repeated just before each observation, and after
this the sphere must be handled as little as possible ; with these precautions a stone
sphere behaves in just the same way. Photographs No. 2 and No. 3* show that the
liquid rises over and surrounds the sphere with a thin close-fitting sheath. Figs. 5
and 6 show a subordinate side-sheath, which, without doubt, was due to the fact that
the sphere had a crack in it, which occasionally carried down air with it, and
disturbed the symmetry of the splash. In Photograph No. 7, however, the symmetry
is complete, and it is nearly so in Photograph No. 8. When any failure of the
polishing occurs, the liquid is kept away from the sphere, and the splash, instead of
being almost noiseless, is accompanied by a sound of bubbles rising to the surface and
bursting. Photograph No. 4 shows this driving away of the liquid, and our note-book
records that this splash was attended by “ neise, bubbles,” &e. In Photograph No. 8
there is a similar sign of roughness on the right-hand side. Very important is the
information given by the shadow thrown across the surface in such figures as 8 and 9.

* The light marking on the right side of Photograph No. 3 is due to a flaw in the negative.
