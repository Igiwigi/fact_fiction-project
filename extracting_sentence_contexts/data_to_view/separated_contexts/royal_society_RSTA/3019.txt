QM is thus not a theory of the dynamics of a mysterious y entity, from which mysteriously the
world of our experience emerges. It is a theory of the possible values that conventional physical
variables take at interactions, and the transition probabilities that determine which values are
likely to be realized, given that others are [26]. The fact that the quantum state is a bookkeeping device that cannot be charged with
ontological weight is emphasized by the following observation [16]. Say I know that at time f
a particle interacts with a x-oriented Stern—Gerlach device. Then I can predict that (if nothing else
happens in between) the particle has probability 3 to be up (or down) spinning, when interacting
with a z-oriented Stern—Gerlach device at time t’.
