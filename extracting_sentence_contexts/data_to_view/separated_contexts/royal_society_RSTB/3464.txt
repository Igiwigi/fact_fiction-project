Behind it, and opposite the anterior region of the hind-brain, there is to be seen, at
the outer side of the lateral border of the medullary plate, a patch, dark by trans-
mitted (fig. 74), and light by reflected (fig. 73), light. This we have ascertained

to be also a ganglionic plate, connected with the deeper part of the lateral edge ot
the medullary plate, from which it extends outwards under cover of the ectoderm of
the head. It is, in fact, the acustico-facial ganglionic Anlage. Caudally to the last-mentioned ganglion-rudiment, we also find, in both of the
specimens (figs. 73 and 74), a narrow arcuate band, or strip, distinguished by its
opacity. In fig. 74 this appears as if directly connected with the edge of the
medullary plate, a short distance behind the acustico-facial ganglion ; whilst, behind,
it appears to merge itself in the paraxial zone, in the region of the most anterior
somite.
