we see that a=; ; and if we represent by « the velocity of the

3. To determine the arbitrary constant C, we observe that e=g, and u=C are always
simultaneous equations. But the former belongs to the confines of the wave, where in
fact u=0; and therefore C=0. Hence for a wave transmitted through a medium which
is itself at rest beyond the limits of the wave, we have these equations*:—

g=arty/plog.t+e(s) =
0=ar+y/ pt+ap(s) |
