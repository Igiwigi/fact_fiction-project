of these two quantities is shown in fig. 9. It will be seen that the yield, after making
allowance for rainfall, still shows strongly the slow changes which originally attracted
attention. The changes in weather only account directly for a portion of the slow
changes observed ; in the first half of the sequence this portion is roughly one-half,
but in the latter half it would appear not to exceed one-quarter of the total effect.

The circumstance that in two cases the depression of yield, after allowing for rainfall,
coincides with a series of years in which the rainfall was on the average unfavourable,
is in accordance with the suggestion previously put forward, that in addition to the
immediate effect of rainy weather on the growing crop, a sequence of wet years produced
an additional and prolonged unfavourable influence by fostering weeds. â€˜Two cases of
agreement are, however, quite insufficient to prove that the additional depression of
yields is causally connected with the rainy periods. The fact of the coincidence, whether
causal or fortuitous, does, however, emphasise the importance of eliminating slow changes
in the study of annual figures ; if slow changes had been ignored in carrying through
the correlational work, we should no doubt have arrived at greatly exaggerated estimates
of the harmful effect of rain. Higher correlations would have been obtained and the
results would have exhibited one more case of high but essentially unreliable correlations
in meteorological agriculture. Against the view that the depression in yields is an
indirect effect of a rainy period must be set the fact that in our diagrams the yield appears
