On the
statistical side also it was necessary to organize the computational work, standardize routine
methods of preparing the sample units, and arrange for continuous and systematic tabulation
of the field data and their final analysis. 38. In fact, apart from the study of the cost and variance functions, one of the great
advantages of the exploratory method was the opportunity it gave for developing suitable
methods of controlling mistakes arising from the human factor, for giving training to the
workers and to build up the necessary human agency for both field and statistical work. Once this was done, and the cost and variance functions were determined, the final stage
was reached when the planning of the sample survey could be undertaken on scientific lines. In one sense there is, of course, no final stage.
