are closed by a coating of vaseline, while the intercellular spaces are connected with
the outer air by cutting the lamina into strips. In this way the well-known fact of
transpiration in saturated air was demonstrated, and a rough method of correcting
transpiration for varying hygrometric conditions was pointed out. This method has
been used throughout my work. The transpiration of a greased and slit leaf has also been used for investigating the
direct effect of light on transpiration.* The intensity of the light was not measured,
the plants being simply exposed to a north, or in some cases east, light of the same
varying character as that of the ordinary porometer experiments.
