following reasons :—

(1.) The structure of the nervous system in the Monkey approaches much more
closely that of Man than Rabbits, Dogs, Cats, &c.

(2.) Monkeys have, by the tests I have applied, shown much more conscious mani-
festations of feeling, by the use of the hand in the removal of the cause of irritation,
than other animals of a lower type are able to do.

(3.) These experiments have been made with strict antiseptic precautions, and the
wound has always healed by first intention, The line of incision in the cord (if the
animal has been allowed to live a sufficiently long time) has been filled up by fibrous
tissue. I have not mentioned the fact previously, but I now take the opportunity of
stating that J have not found new nerve fibres at the seat of lesion, thus agreeing with
ScHIEFFERDECKER,* Gourzt and Frevspere, and Homén,{ and opposing the results of
Navyn and Ercuorst.

The literature relating to experiments upon animals of a lower zoological type than
the Monkey is enormous. Dogs, Cats, Pigeons, Pigs, Guinea Pigs, Frogs, and Rabbits
have been used for experiments, and a variety of lesions have been produced with
a view of determining the paths of conduction.

A concise and able summary of the results of these experiments is given by KOBNER
in his article on “ Unilateral Lesions of the Spinal Cord” (‘ Deutsch. Archiv fiir Klin.
Med.,’ 1877), and also by Eck#arp in his most admirable article, “ Riickenmark und
