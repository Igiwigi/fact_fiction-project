for the eye-balls. The first effect of this is seen in the discontinuity between the
anterior part of the orbital cartilage which remains attached to the interorbital septum
and the posterior part which is continuous with the pila antotica, and its further effect
is the reduction of the anterior orbital cartilage into the planum supraseptale. As
a result of this reduction, the olfactory nerve ceases to have any cartilage between
it and the orbit, through which it then runs. It is interesting to compare this state
of affairs with that which prevails in certain fish such as Salmo. There (DE BEER,
1927), the olfactory nerve finds itself in the orbit, not as a result of any reduction in
the orbital cartilage, but as a consequence of a relative forward displacement of the
lamina orbitonasalis.

With regard to the reduction of the anterior orbital cartilage in the duck, our results
are in complete agreement with those of Sonres (1907) as to fact; it is only with his
interpretation of these results and with his application of the term lamina orbitonasalis
to the preoptic root of the orbital cartilage that we are unable to agree. A somewhat
similar reduction in the orbital cartilage, though rather difficult to follow, occurs

according to SuscuK1nâ€™s (1899) descriptions in Tinnunculus. It is, however, by no
means universal in birds, for the sparrow presents a very different state of affairs.
