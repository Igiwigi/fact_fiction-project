(1) Introduction.

The study of stress distributions in elastic plates would seem to have many important
applications in engineering practice, and from this point of view it is, at first sight,
surprising that our knowledge of the subject is not more detailed than it is at present.
True, the fact that the stresses are derivable from a stress-function, and the equation
satisfied by this stress-function, have long been known* ; particular solutions, satisfying
the types of boundary condition met with in practice are, however, rare. JEFFERY,
in his paper, “ Plane Stress and Plane Strain in Bipolar Co-ordinates,”’} says that in
the problem of the equilibrium of an elastic solid “* knowledge comes by patient accumu-
lation of special solutions rather than by the establishment of great general propositions ” }
and later, that “it is of considerable importance that the two-dimensional problems
should be worked out more thoroughly.” The present paper is an attempt to fill one
gap by a fairly full examination of the stresses round a circular hole in an otherwise
infinite elastic plate of uniform thickness, due to prescribed tractions in the plane of
the plate, acting on the circular boundary. A general solution is obtained and
particular cases are examined in detail, these cases being chosen to combine, as far as
possible, mathematical simplicity with some semblance of the type of distribution of
