No. 6, that there may have been an expansion
of the ductus endolymphaticus between the cartilaginous cranium and the dermal
bone of the skull roof, is of very little significance. No. 9 is of very little importance. No. 11, the relation of the anterior end of the supraorbital canal to the nostril, is of
course completely changed by the alteration in the position of the nostril, and is in fact
as in Acanthodians, and not as in Elasmobranchs. Nos. 1 and 10 are dealt with
below. Professor Brortt added to the series of Elasmobranch resemblances of Macro-
petalichthys the following:

(1) The ventral position of the mouth.

(2) The structure of the mandible.

(3) The scales acting as teeth.

(4) The five branchial arches.

(5) The thoroughly Selachian-like shoulder girdle.
(6) The Elasmobranch-like paired fins.
