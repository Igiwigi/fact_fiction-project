The Rhaetic and Trias are 50-120 ft. thick in Northamptonshire and presumably
disappear altogether a few miles to the east of the bores shown in figure 12. Only at
Corby does the seismic work suggest the presence of Trias. These facts strongly suggest that the Lower Lias lies on the Palaeozoic over most of
the area between Northampton and Cambridge, and that over the eastern half of this
area it is succeeded by the Great Oolite limestone. The relations are illustrated diagram-

* Whatever may be the shortcomings of this bore (see above), it is highly probable that it nearly
reached the Palaeozoic.
