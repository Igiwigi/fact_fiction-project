For instance, the
parameter to +_ comm, the commutativity of addition, is a number of the form (+ a b) forsome
a and b. When applied to an argument of the necessary form, the output type of +_comm will be
the equality type ( = ( + a b) ( + b a) ) .Note that we can equally formalize this (and
all other) axioms without pattern matching on syntactic forms, but rather by taking any numbers
aand b and returning an equality ( = ( + a b) ( + b a) ) .While this latter form would
more faithfully represent the property of commutativity of addition, it would also generate more
actions during proof search, since it applies to any real numbers regardless of whether we are
already considering their sum. Thus, the form we write these axioms reflects both the properties
we need and the fact that we tend to apply these properties once we already have an object that
suggests they will be useful. In practice, this narrows down the action space without ruling out
natural solutions. Table 1.
