Lattice vibrations appear at 45 and 65 um; they have
no counterpart in the vapour because they are intermolecular vibrations of the hydrogen bond. Comparing figure 1b to figure le shows the relationship of mye to mim: wherever mim is large (of
order 1), the real index undergoes an oscillation, finally asymptoting to a higher level at longer
wavelength, increasing from 1.3 in the visible to 1.8 in the microwave. The real and imaginary
indices are related by Kramersâ€”Kronig relations; in fact the mye(A) in figure 1 was computed from
a weighted integral of mim over wavelength as detailed by Warren [3] and WBO08 [4].

(b) Birefringence

Ordinary ice has a hexagonal crystal structure, so it is birefringent; refraction depends on the
angle between the c-axis of the crystal and the direction and polarization of the incident light. For example, at the visible wavelength 546nm, mye = 1.3104 for the ordinary ray and 1.3118


for the extraordinary ray ([8], table 3.1). This small difference, only 0.1%, can be ignored for 4 |
computing reflectances and transmittances of clouds and snow, but it is large enough to be useful

for determining crystal sizes and orientations in polycrystalline ice by putting a thin section of ice
between crossed polarizers.
