A. CAYLEY'S FOURTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS.

coefficients, that is, it is a cubinvariant. 'This agrees with the before-mentioned t
for the number of cubinyariants.

79. In the case of the quartic (a, 6, c, d, eXz, y)', the cubinyariant is, by the |
mode of generation, obtained in the form

elac—8)—4d4(ad—bc)+6cz(ae—4d +30) — —4b{(be—cd)+a(ve—d), '

i ; to
which is in fact equal Sfcog= Hato
and omitting the numerical factor 3, we have the cubinvariant of the quartic.

80. In the case of a quantic of any order even or odd, the quadrinyariants of |
quadricovariants are quartinvariants of the quantic. But these quartinyariants are not
of them independent, and there is no obvious method grounded on the preceding mc
of generation for obtaining the number of the independent (asyzygetic) quartinyariar
and thence the number of the irreducible quartinyariants of a quantic of a given orde
