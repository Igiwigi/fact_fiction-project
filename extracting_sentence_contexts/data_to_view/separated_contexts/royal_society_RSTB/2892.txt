A According to Dattâ€™s view, the interlamellar septum in the gills of the majority of
Lamellibranchia is the persistent central portion of the Protobranch leaflet, the
filament proper being the equivalent of the swollen lower edge, which alone is
provided with cilia and thickened chitin. This hypothesis necessitates the admission
that in the gradual increase of the vertical extent of the gill lamella the abaxial end
of the thickened rim is as relatively fixed as the axial end, and that the extreme
ventral point of the filament at the lower edge of the demibranch of the ordinary
Lamellibranch gill represents a point halfway along the thickened rim of the leaflet,
as shown in fig. 4 (p. 176). That this is an untenable view is rendered more than probable by the fact that all
