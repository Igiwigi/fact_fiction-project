bodies according to the present state of our knowledge, as
undecompounded, and potash and soda as metallic oxides,
capable of being decomposed and recomposed, like other
bodies of this class, and with similar phenomena.

Since that time, various repetitions of the most obvious of
the experiments on this subject, have been made in different
parts of Europe. The generality of enlightened chemists,
have. expressed themselves satisfied both with the experi-
ments, and the conclusions drawn from them : but as usually
happens in a $tate of activity in science, and when the objects
of enquiry are new, and removed from the common order of
facts, some enquirers have given hypothetical explanations of
the phaznomena, different from those I adopted.

MM. Gay Lussac and THENARD, as I have mentioned on
a former occasion, suppose potassium and sodium to be com-
pounds of potash and soda, with hydrogene; | a similar
opinion seems to be entertained by M. RiTTER. M. Cura-
DAUÂ® affects to consider them as combinations of charcoal,
or of charcoal and hydrogene, with the alkalies ; and an En-
quirer in our own country, regards them as composed of
oxygene and hydrogene.

I shall examine such of those notions only, as have been
