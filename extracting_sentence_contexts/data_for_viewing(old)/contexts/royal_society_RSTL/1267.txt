though much more Slowly than the parts above the incisions.
They have also observed that a small elevated ridge (bour-
velet ) is formed round the lower lip of the wound in the
bark, which makes some slight advances to meet the bark
and wood projected, in much large quantity, from the oppo-
site, or upper lip of the wound.

I have endeavoured, in a former Memoir,* to explain the
cause why some portion of growth takes place below inci-
sions through the bark, by supposing that a small part of the
true sap, descending from the leaves, escapes. downwards
through the porous substance of the alburnum. Several facts
stated by HaLes seem favourable to this supposition ; and the
existence of a power in the alburnum to carry. the ap in
different directions, is proved in the growth of inverted cut-
tings. of different species of trees,f But I have derived s0
