to the exclusion of the others) are nutrient arteries, veins, lymphatics and “ fine’ vessels.



LYMPHATICS IN THE COD (G@ADUS MORRHUA). 349

With regard to the first three little need be said, as their nature and uses are fairly
obvious, but with regard to the fourth—the “ fine ’’ vessels—it is otherwise, and it is
not easy to explain either what they are, or what part they take in the vascularisation of
the gill. An important point to be noticed in their distribution is their very intimate
association, with the whole length of the filamentary efferent branchial vessels and with
the little radicles that connect these vessels with the respiratory laminw. That this
association has some special value is, I think, suggested by the fact that in Lophius in
which the fourth gill has no respiratory filaments, the arch is not accompanied, as are
the others, by a leash of “ fine ” vessel trunks, but is supplied indirectly from the pharyn-
geal “ fine ” vessel.

In the respiratory region the contact between the ‘fine vessels and the arteries
is very close, as pointed out above, but there was no proof of actual continuity. In
thé non-respiratory region, that is the segment of the filamentary vessel between the
laminar area of the gill filament (Plate 84, fig. 4, rsp./.) and the main efferent vessel
within the arch, evidence is, however, forthcoming of an actual open connection,
though of the very slenderest description. This will be described more fully in dealing
with the general relation of the ‘* fine” vessels with the arteries, but it is convenient
to refer here to certain observations made by Hyrrn (9) on the gill of the Salmon
