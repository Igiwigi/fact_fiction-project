abruptly, but fall off gradually through the layer from their full values on one side to
zero on the other. The mean values of E and H through the layer, that is, $B and
4H are thus the effective electric and magnetic forces on the layer as a whole, per
unit volume density of matter or current; or 4E and 3H per unit surface density
when the layer is indefinitely reduced in thickness.

Considering the electric field only, the quantities concerned are electrification and
magnetic current. In the magnetic field only they are magnetification and electric
current. Imagine the medium divided into two regions A and B, of which A i
internal, B external, and let N be the unit normal from the surface into the external
region. The mechanical action between the two regions is fully represented by
stress Py over their interface, and the forcive of B upon A is fully represented
the E and Hin B acting upon the fictitious matter and current produced on
boundary of B, on the assumption that E and H terminate there. If the no
and Py be drawn the other way, thus negativing them both, as well as the fictitious
matter and current on the interface, then it is the forcive of A on B that is repre

sented by the action of E and H in A on the new interfacial matter and current.
That is, the E and H in the region A may be done away with altogether, because
their abolition will immediately introduce the fictitious matter and current equivalent,
so far as B is concerned, to the influence of the region A. Similarly E and H in B
may be abolished without altering them in A. And, generally, any portion of the
