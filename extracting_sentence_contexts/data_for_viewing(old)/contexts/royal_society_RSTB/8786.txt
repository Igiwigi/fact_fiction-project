explanation for the slow acquisition of certain structures—the pointing gestures predict the onset of nouns, but iconic gestures do

not predict the onset of verbs.
?This selectivity can be seen in the fact that the onset of complemen-
tary point + noun combinations (point at box + ‘box’) predicted the

cognitive explanation, that is, that children do not express a
given structure because they lack an understanding of the

notion underlying the structure. Widening our lens to include onset of determiner + noun combinations (‘the box’) in these 18 chil-
the manual modality thus allows insight into when cognition dren, but not the onset of two-word combinations containing a verb

gesture + speech combinations (point at box + ‘open’) [34].
“Interestingly, David treated iconic gestures serving two different
noun functions in precisely the same way with respect to hand-
