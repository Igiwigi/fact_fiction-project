The purpose of this brief discussion
is not to obtain quantitative results, for which the data are insufficient, but to indicate
that the elastic interaction of dislocations will give an effective value of E which is lower
than that for the perfect lattice, the exact value depending upon the nature and distribution
of imperfections in the crystal, as measured by //d. The assumptions on which the theory is
based are also clearly too artificial to correspond very closely to reality. The behaviour for small glides should be, then, very dependent upon the density and
distribution of dislocations in the specimen, which accounts for the fact that it differs so
much from specimen to specimen, especially with very pure metals. Experiment leaves

* For the calculated values at the high temperature, it has been assumed that the single-crystal value of

E varies with temperature to the same extent as the polycrystalline value, which must be, in any case, a good
approximation.
