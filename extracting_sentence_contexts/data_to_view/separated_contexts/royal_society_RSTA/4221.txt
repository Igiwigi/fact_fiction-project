In the periodic case, the corrector problem is posed on a bounded
domain (namely, the periodic cell Q), because the corrector wy is periodic. In sharp contrast,
the corrector problem (2.3) of the random case is posed on the whole space R?, and cannot be
reduced to a problem posed on a bounded domain. The fact that the random corrector problem
is posed on the entire space has far-reaching consequences for numerical practice. Truncations of
problem (2.3) have to be considered. The actual homogenized coefficients are only captured in the
asymptotic regime.
