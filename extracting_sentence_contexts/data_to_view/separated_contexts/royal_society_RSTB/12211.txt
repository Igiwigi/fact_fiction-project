Based on the single site available for sampling, Pleisto-

higher population densities than their modern counterparts
(figure 2; 15,302 = 11.13, p < 0.0001), growing under the same
temperature and salinity conditions. Although it is imposs-
ible to quantify nutrient levels at the Pleistocene sites,
density (number of oysters m™*) is almost an order of magni-
tude higher in these fossil reefs, despite the fact that nutrient
