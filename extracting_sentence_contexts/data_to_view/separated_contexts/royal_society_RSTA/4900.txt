On p. 11 is given a typical set of measurements of t
dust figures, and on p. 27 a series of experiments on ethyl chloride that afford a te
of the accuracy of the vapour density determinations. The experiments on carbon dioxide (‘Table XXTI., below) show further, that whilst th
work was in progress no change took place in the apparatus that affected the resul
The first three experiments on carbon dioxide were made when the apparatus W
first set up; the last three were made two years later, after it had been repeated)
dismantled for cleaning, and repairs and most of the original tubes had been rep

atmospheric temperature—a fact which tends to increase the experimental error,
small errors in reading the height of the mercury column in the vapour den
apparatus have a more serious effect when the total pressure to be measured is s™
and in addition to this, the small range of pressure available makes it difficult

aw the isothermal curve accurately. Hence the vapour-density determinations in
me cases give a rather irregular curve, but when the divergences are so great as to
ave much doubt how the curve should be drawn, I have made a separate determi-
ation of the relative densities in the way described under ethyl chloride in my
rmer paper.
