giving ‘006 grm. reduced by the maltose produced by the diastase in the germinati
grains. ;
Neither the resting grains, nor those that had been steeped in water gave 4
evidence of diastatic action, there being only the merest suggestion of reduction
boiling the digestions with Frauie’s fluid. ;
In Zamia, then, as starch is produced after the absorption of sugar by the
grains, and before visible germination commences, there is a simultaneous formation
diastase to provide for its digestion. No such formation takes place, unless the sug
is absorbed. Either cane sugar or grape sugar will give rise to this appearance
starch. What the antecedent condition of the diastase may be, or whether it
secreted by the protoplasm when required, is a point that will be referred to later.
One more curious fact with regard to the diastase of the pollen of L. pardalir

‘be narrated here. Attempting to confirm the initial diminution of diastase on
ommencement of germination, as described above, the pollen was found to have
its power of putting out tubes. Out of a large quantity sown, very few grains
ommenced growing, It seemed desirable to investigate the diastatic power of
sollen in this condition, and to see whether any connection could be traced
en the power of germinating and the activity of the enzyme. The pollen
ining weighed ‘3 grm. ; it was ground up in an agate mortar and mixed with
b. centims. of starch paste (1 per cent.). Half of it was then boiled for fifteen
