For example, the case of polygonal zonal jets of potential vorticity present
in the Southern Hemisphere when the southern polar vortex is active, during the months
of July-August. In figure 7, we see an example of an hexagonal jet which occurred in
1998.

(b) Non-fixed polar vortices

As previously commented, this case has a system of a higher number of degrees of freedom with
respect to the case of fixed polar vortices and has been summarized in proposition 6.3. Due to the
fact that the Hessian now has non-diagonal terms we cannot fully diagonalize the Hamiltonian
as before using only the properties of circulant matrices. From proposition 6.3 and corollary 7.1,
by taking Tsp = â€”N-TI, np, We can immediately infer the following corollary to deduce stability
zones. PV, 350 K, 15 July 1998 16 July 1998
