which it was conveyed to be the absorbent system, upon the
Supposition that they might admit of a retrograde motion of
their contents.

Without adopting the theory of Dr. Darwin, it did appear
to me that the fact deserved to be ascertained by some test
more decisive than nitre, and I conceived that if prussiate of
potash could be taken with safety, its presence would be dis-
cerned by means of a solution of iron in as small proportion
as almost any known chemical test. Upon trial of this salt, I

inconvenience, and that in less than one hour and a half the
urine became perceptibly impregnated, and continued 80 to
the fifth or sixth hour, although the quantity taken had not

After a few previous trials of the period when the principal
impregnation of the urine might be expected, and when the
