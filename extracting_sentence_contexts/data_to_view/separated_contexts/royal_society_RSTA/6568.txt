In this experiment, the limit was fixed at 1-74, corresponding to a range of 3mm.
in air for a-particles and heavier particles. (In converting ranges in the Ilford concentrated
emulsions to the corresponding ranges in air, the stopping-power data of Lattes, Fowler &
Ciier (1947) are employed.) This restriction leads to the imposition of a lower limit on e,
for a given value of m, and an upper limit (4,,,,.) on 6 when m and E are specified. The cross-
section (¢) for the production of recoil tracks of range greater than 1-7, can then be cal-
culated, if the charge numbers (2, z’) of the fission fragment and the recoil nucleus are known;

sponding to recoil angle @,,,,. The cross-section calculated from these formulae is in fact
greater than the true cross-section because no allowance has been made for the screening
of the nuclear charges by extranuclear electrons. Nevertheless, it may be used to estimate
an upper limit for the probability of occurrence of nuclear recoil tracks longer than 1-7. Figure 4, Recoil process diagram.
