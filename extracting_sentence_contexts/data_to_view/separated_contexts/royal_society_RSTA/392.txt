It is clear from the results described above that even in the
presence of a lubricant the same processes may occur. The oil film at the surface is
unable to prevent local metallic contact and seizure from occurring. The fact that an
e.m.f. can be developed between the surfaces, even in the presence of lubricants, has
already been given as evidence that metal to metal contact is taking place under these
conditions (Bowden and Ridler 1936). During the subsequent motion the metallic
junctions are broken and extensive distortion and tearing of the metal occurs. Typical
examples of such behaviour are given by mineral oils.
