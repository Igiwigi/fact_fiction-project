solid line: including a paternal age effect and with age of puberty scaling with
generation time, assuming tpup = 14 yr when tyen = 30 yr. Overall rates per
basepair are scaled to be 0.5 10°? bp” ' yr! when fyen = 30 yr.

yearly rate from approximately 1 x 10~° bp“! yr™' in the past
to 0.5 x 10°’ bp”? yr“! today (figure 1).

However, as noted by Ségurel et al. [5], this model is too
simplistic, for in supposing that the number of mutations
per generation is independent of ftyen, it ignores the fact
that older fathers tend to pass on more mutations to their
offspring than younger fathers. This phenomenon, the
paternal age effect, is a consequence of the fact that cell-div-
ision replication errors are the major source of germline
mutation, and whereas in both sexes there are several div-
isions associated with embryonic development prior to
gametogenesis, spermatogenesis in males involves a process
of continuous further cell division throughout reproductive
life. Hence the older the father, the more cell divisions his
gametes will have passed through, and the more errors accu-
mulated. By contrast, in oogensis a stock of primary oocytes
is generated within the developing embryo, each of which is
held in stasis until the final two meiotic divisions leading to
ovulation later in life.
