already been found by Meinesz (1934) and appears to be a common feature of the gravita-
tional field in such regions. It is natural to inquire how far the presence of the low-velocity
layers found by Bullard’s seismic experiment can account for this. The method of allowing
for the lower density of these layers has already been described in § 4-23. Figure 8 shows
diagrammatically the effect of applying these corrections and also of assuming that the
sediments are not compensated. The full curve shows the Hayford anomalies as in figure 7a
but on a larger scale. The dashed line indicates the corrected curve after assuming that the
density of the low-velocity layers is 2-27 and that they are fully compensated. The curve is
slightly flatter, but the difference is not great. In contrast, the dotted curve shows the
anomalies on the assumption that the low-density layers are uncompensated. They there-
fore appear as a load on the crust, and the calculated value of gravity is increased by nearly
100 mgals locally. Since no such anomalies are observed the region must be very nearly in
isostatic equilibrium. This agrees well with the known facts concerning the Fennoscandian
uplift. Niskanen (1939, 1943) and Meinesz (1937) have reviewed the available data, and the
latter concludes that for a linear structure such as the continental shelf, 7, the time taken to
return half-way to the equilibrium position, and /, the linear dimensions perpendicular to
the axis, are connected by the relation Jr=15 x 106 km, years. Taking /=100 km., this gives
T=1+5 x 10° years. There is still much uncertainty as to the age of the sediments forming the
continental shelf, but the main bulk of them must certainly be much more than 105

years
old. They should therefore have had ample time to attain isostatic equilibrium.
