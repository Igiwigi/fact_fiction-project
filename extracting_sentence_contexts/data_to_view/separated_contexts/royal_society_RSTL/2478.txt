in his memoir © De Gammari Pulicis Histo-
ria Naturali,” 4to, 1832. Hitherto I have confined these obseryations to the Malacostraca, because it is in
that division of the class that the non-existence of metamorphoses has been denied. The Entomostraca are admitted on all hands to undergo very material modifications
of form, as may be seen from the researches of JurINE, STRAUss, PreEvosT, &c.; whilst
Mr, Trowesoxn's recent memoir upon Artemia (not Artemis,) is an additional evidence
of the same fact, although the nature of the various alterations is very far from being
detailed in that satisfactory manner which the author seems 80 capable of doing. I have therefore now to detail, as the third portion of this essay, such circum-
stances as have fallen under my own observation relative to this interesting inquiry,
the tendency of which is precisely similar to that exhibited by the two preceding por-
tions of my treatise. We have seen that Mr. Trowmeson's chief argument is founded upon the supposed
transformations of the Zoe into a Crab.
