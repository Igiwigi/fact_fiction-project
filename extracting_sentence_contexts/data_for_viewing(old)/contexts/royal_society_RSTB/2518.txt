Lastly, the fact that certain conditions which occur in Man as congenital defects
are normal in some animals, may assist the ophthalmologist in diagnosis, and we
shall certainly find abundant field for physiological speculations which may advance
our knowledge of vision, and bring us nearer to the solution of the problem of
colour perception.

The first part of this paper contains a systematic record of the observations made.
In the second part some of the implied problems and resulting generalisations are
dealt with.

Icannot conclude this introduction without expressing my deep indebtedness to my
friend Mr. H. pz Mosexrwat, F.1.C., who has assisted me throughout in the arrange-
ment of the well-nigh overwhelming material, and the co-ordination of the facts
arising from it; his assistance has been of the utmost value in compiling this paper.

Lastly, I have to thank Dr. H. Gapow, F.R.S., for his uniform kindness to me, and
for the encouraging interest he has taken in this work.

1. Homo.—When examining the normal eye of Man with the ophthalmoscope, we
perceive the fundus of an orange-red or vermilion ground. To the inner side of the
axial line of vision we see a well-defined circular or oval pinkish disc—the so-called
