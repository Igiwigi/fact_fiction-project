through the postero-lateral fissure. 'The rest of the posterior roots partly descend towards
the centre of the anterior cornu, and partly cross the posterior cornu diagonally in
connexion with a chain of cells, to be continuous with the transverse commissure, In
the cervical enlargement (fig. 45), the cells of the anterior cornu are more numerous
and more diversified in shape; some of them send processes. towards the anterior com-
missure, but a great number have no apparent connexion with it.

In my firs: communication on the s8pinal cord, I stated that the posterior roots of the
spinal nerves are attached exclusively to the posterior white columns. T have since
found that the same assertion was made by RoLaxD0: he says, © tutti i fili nervosi delle
radici posteriori 8 staccano esclusivamente dai cordoni posteriori del gran funicolo spi-
nale; cio che puo essere comprovato in yarie e differenti maniere#*.” S7T111x6 denies
the fact, and maintains that in the lumbar region a few fibres traverse the posterior part
of the antero-lateral column. I have again carefully gone over the ground, in the cord
both of Man and different animals, and find that my statement is correct. ST1L11NG has
probably confounded nerve-fibres with the blood-yessels which traverse the posterior part
of the antero-lateral column much in the way that he represents.

APPENDIX.
[Added during the printing of the Paper.]

Convinced of the superiority and yalue, in many respects, of my method of anatomical
research, I will here describe it more fully, together with the modifications which T
have lately introduced in s80me stages of the process, and the precautions necessary t0
be observed in order to ensure 8uccess. 6
