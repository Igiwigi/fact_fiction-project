He
realized that there were several sets of three elements among which one element had an atomic
weight that was approximately the average of the other two. For example, sodium has an atomic
weight of approximately 23 and thus represents the average of the weight of lithium (7) and
that of potassium (39). This fact alone is already suggestive but it becomes even more suggestive
when combined with the realization that the chemical and physical properties of sodium are also
intermediate between those of lithium and potassium. It therefore appears that a relationship
between atomic weights is able to capture a relationship between the properties of different
elements. In retrospect, DÃ©bereiner had essentially discovered chemical periodicity since what underlies
the existence of triads is the fact that sodium and potassium occur are regular distances away
from lithium in terms of the sequence of increasing atomic weights.
