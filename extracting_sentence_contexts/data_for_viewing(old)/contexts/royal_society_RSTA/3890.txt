they were initiated after the spalling damage and they had no influence on the spalling process. a)
The damaged zone located in the bottom of the specimen has been initiated after the main 13
spalling process. These cracks are due to interaction between release waves coming from the S
spall zone and secondary loadings due to the sinusoidal form of the current discharge. This is 78
confirmed by the fact that fewer cracks are initiated in the damaged zone located in the bottom iw
of the specimen. The main damaged zone located between the two horizontal dashed lines is :
about 1.55mm in width. Good correlation between the size and the location of the damaged : a
zone obtained experimentally and the damage field obtained numerically can be observed. : a
Moreover, due to the low loading rate, this spall zone obtained by numerical simulation is .
not fully damaged. The crack density in the damaged zone is determined by calculating the
mean distance between cracks (this mean distance is determined by counting the number of
cracks crossing a vertical line located in this zone). For the SPS-S grade, a crack density between
2.5 x 10!0 and 8.3 x 10! cracks m~$ with a mean value of 1.7 x 10!" cracks m~$ has been obtained.
Good correlation is observed with numerical predictions, with a crack density between 10!Â° and
10! cracks m~? obtained numerically.

In the case of the PS-S grade, only the spall has been recovered due to the higher loading rate
