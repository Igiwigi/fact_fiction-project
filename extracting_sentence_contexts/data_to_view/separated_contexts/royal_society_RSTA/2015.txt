Case 3. a=B =0.7, a, =b, =1, a2 =0.5, by =0.25. For this case, the Bagley—Torvik
conditions (2.12) and (2.13) are satisfied.

— Case 4. We take a = 8 =0.7, a1 = by =az2 =b2 = 1.0, which is, in fact, the classical Hook
case. In figure 1, we show ¢ as a function of time f € [0,3], for Cases 1, 3 and 4. We note that in Case 3,
for small times the solution is concave curve and ‘above’ the classical Case 4 case.
