ite. when the changes in the state of the system obey a gradient
response: the steeper the derivative in the right-hand side, the larger
the damping in the opposite direction. For a noise-free one-dimen-
sional system, this function simply reads V(x) = — f f,,(x) dx. It can
be shown that the minima (maxima) of V(x) correspond to the
stable (unstable) fixed points.

Here, the cooperative loop results in fact from a reciprocally selfish
exchange. As discussed in Herre et al. [66], other things being
equal, each component of the pair will tend to maximize its net
gain from the coral-algae exchange (by minimizing costs and maxi-
mizing benefits). This selfishness has the potential to lead to
ecological instability.
