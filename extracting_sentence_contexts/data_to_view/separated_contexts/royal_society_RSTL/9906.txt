It gave the citron s8pectrum most brilliantly
—equal, in fact, to the mixture of earths obtained from zircons (18, 21) at 80 great an
expenditure of time and trouble. Orangite treated in the same manner gave almost
as good a spectrum. Pure thorinic sulphate prepared by myself was found not to
give the citron band, but three specimens prepared and given to me by friends all
gave it, 80 it was not unlikely that in thorite and orangite might at last be found a
good 8ource of the long-80ught element—that in fact the body I was hunting for, if
not thorina, might possibly be Bank's hypothetical wasium. Having obtained about
2 1bs. of orangite and thorite, they were worked up as follows :—
