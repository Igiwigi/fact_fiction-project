the ascending parietal and the adjacent part of the second frontal gyrus, and it abuts
below on the face-area, and in front on the head-area.{ Again the retraction of the
shoulder and arm, which is produced by excitation at the upper part of the area on
either side of the fissure of Rotanpo, is largely produced, as Ferrier has also shown,
by the latissimus dorsi (although other muscles are also thrown into action), and might
be described as the latissimus-centre.

The face-area, although we have so called it for convenience sake, actually gives
rise to movements not only of the facial muscles, but also of the whole of the upper
part of the alimentary tube (mouth, throat, and larynx). It comprises the whole of
the ascending parietal and frontal convolutions below the arm-area, extending down
to the fissure of Synv1us, and including the external surface of the operculum. It is
physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements which result
from its excitation are apt to be executed bilaterally, which is only exceptionally the
case with excitation of the other areas (except that for the head and eyes).

Excitation of the upper third or half of the area causes winking, or closure of the
eyelids, elevation of the ala of the nose, and retraction and elevation of the angle
of the mouth. This may be termed the wpper fuce-centre.

+ A lesion of the ascending frontal portion of this centre, producing paralysis of the hand and fore-
arm, is shown by Frreter in ‘ Functions of the Brain,’ 2nd edition, fig. 113, p. 351.
