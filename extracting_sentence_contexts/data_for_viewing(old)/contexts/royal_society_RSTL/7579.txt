492 DR. W. H. RANSOM ON THE OVUM OF OSSEOUS FISHES.

Without giving a detailed analysis of this group of experiments, I will briefly
the inferences which they appear to justify.

The contractions of the yelk, and to a somewhat less degree, the cleavage, are re
able for the small amount of oxygen which they demand for their maintenance.
was shown indeed in the experiments upon the eggs of the stickleback (pages 472 to 475
which seemed almost to justify the view that oxygen in the surrounding medium is
an essential condition of protoplasmic contraction, until the more extended obseryati
on the pike ova enabled me to arrive at a more correct conclusion.

The experiments Â«, 6, c, also establish the fact, that the rhythmic contractions de
but little oxygen for their support, as they persisted for seventy-two to seventy-six ho!
in water deprived of oxygen, as far as it is possible to do, by boiling in air.

The persistence of yelk-contractions in eggs which are already in part decomposing, i
probably another illustration of this general rule.

That cleavage also demands but little oxygen appeared from the experiments 1, 2, 3,
on the ova of the stickleback, page 473, for it progressed in limited areas, and in water
partly deprived of oxygen apparently as rapidly as it did in open vessels.

One is almost led to infer, on comparing the results of the experiments upon the pike
ova with those of the stickleback, that the former require proportionally more oxygen
