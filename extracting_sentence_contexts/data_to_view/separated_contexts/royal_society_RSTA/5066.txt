Equations (3.1) and (3.2a,b) show that the loads on the wind turbine structure can be alleviated
by appropriately modifying the pitch angle 6. However, careful design of the control algorithm
is required in order to avoid alleviation of loads using the pitch controller from interfering with
power generation. In fact, small changes in pitch angle can have a dramatic effect on the power
output [34]. The application of active pitch control for wind turbine load reduction is presented
in [2,4,36]. Active pitch control interacts strongly with the turbine dynamics, in particular with
the tower dynamics, and under certain circumstances can lead to instability of the active system
if the gains of the controller are not designed properly.
