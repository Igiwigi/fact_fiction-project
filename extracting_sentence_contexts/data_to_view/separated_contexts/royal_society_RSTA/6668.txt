The nature of the requisite modification was never in doubt; for an
increase in the assumed value of k, unaccompanied by any change in the assumed shape,
decreases 7 everywhere according to (33), while an increase given at some point to the radius
of the jet entails a reduction at that point of 4Ã© and therefore of 1 - and 7. At neighbouring
points it increases 7 by rendering the jet more concave: consequently errors of opposite
sign could be eliminated by changing the shape of the free stream-line, errors all of like sign
by changing k. In fact only two changes of k were necessary, since the second (by good fortune) led to
negligible errors at all points. Initially p was assumed to have the value 0-71, and sub-
sequently this was altered to 0-75 and 0-78 (the accepted figure). Our first attempts were
made on a net fairly coarse in all parts, since it was apparent that a finer mesh near B would
yield for that point a value of dy/dv higher by an amount fairly easy to estimate.
