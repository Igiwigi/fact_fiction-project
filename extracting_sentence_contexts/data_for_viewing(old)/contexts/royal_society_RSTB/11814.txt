Sex-specific viability in early generation hybrids may
result from the greater impact of deleterious recessive alleles
on hybrids of the heterogametic sex, i.e. the faster X/Z theory
and mitonuclear incompatibilities. This may lead to a biased
sex ratio affecting sexual conflict and sex-specific adaptation
as outlined above. Meta-analyses of sex ratios in young
hybrid populations or in hybrid zones would allow testing
of this hypothesis, especially given such data must have
been already collected and should be available from the
numerous field studies of hybrid zones published over the
years. Another interesting comparison would be one of sex
ratios between young hybrid taxa or hybrid swarms and
old, stabilized hybrid taxa. Taking advantage of the fact
that nucleotide diversity on the Y/W chromosome depends
only on the effective population size of the heterogametic
sex, while the nucleotide diversity of the other sex chromo-
some depends on effective population sizes of both sexes, it
is possible to tentatively infer past sex ratios. Comparing
the relative effective population sizes of the two hetero-
morphic sex chromosomes in hybrid taxa and parental taxa
(where other factors affecting this ratio, such as mating sys-
tems should be very similar) could hence be informative of
differences in sex-specific survival between these taxa. Sex-
specific viability may affect local adaptation by relaxing
sexual selection, and by increasing the probability of popu-
