The family has long been recognised as holding an intermediate position between
Eusporangiate and Leptosporangiate Ferns, as regards the size, structure, and mode
of origin of the sporangia. The observations on which this view has been based have
been made chiefly on Osmunda.t Though I have already published a preliminary
note on the development in Todea barbara,t as well as a brief description with
figures,ยง there are various facts of interest not there fully dealt with which will
justify a fresh description for this species. A point which comes out very plainly from comparison of a number of sporangia
of Todea barbara is that there is a great variety of detail in the segmentation, size,
and form of sporangia on the same leaf, notwithstanding that they represent actually
similar stages of development. These differences start from the very first, as is seen
from fig.
