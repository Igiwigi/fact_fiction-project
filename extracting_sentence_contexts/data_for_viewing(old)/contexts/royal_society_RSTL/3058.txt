class of phenomena which it had long been the reproach of that theory to be snp-
posed incapable of accounting for, if they were not absolutely contradictory to it.
At any rate, if, in the instances referred to, the discrepancies should by any be thought
$till too great, or if it should be contended that other cases may yet arise in which
theory may be put to a seyerer test, yet, with s0 strong a presumption in its fayour,
the only fair inference would be, that further examination was required of the prin-
ciples on which any extension or modification of the theory might be pursued.

(2.) The investigation, then, having advanced thus far, it seemed desirable, as a se-
quel to my former papers, to devote the present to some remarks connected with the
theory which has been thus applied.

The facts of interference, on which the undulatory theory was originally based by
Dr. Youxs, obliged us to adopt some idea of an alternating motion, as well as a motion
of translation, in our conception of light. And this, with all the accessions it has re-
ceived, especially from the investigations of FrzsxeL, has at the present day been con-
nected by the labours of M. Caveny and others with general dynamical principles,
which regulate the propagation of vibratory motions through an elastic medium.

(3.) More precisely, from such dynamical principles certain differential equations
of motion have been deduced; the integration of which gives the well-known expres-
sion for a wave, involving the relation between the velocity and the wave-length which
explains the dispersion. The direct and complete integration of these forms, effected
