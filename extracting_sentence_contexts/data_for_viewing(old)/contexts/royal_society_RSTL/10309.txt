separate off as a blastoderm, while the inner portions usually fuse together, more or
less perfectly, to form a central food-yolk, which fills the space which in ordinary eggs
constitutes the segmentation cavity. A small portion of the blastoderm then becomes
invaginated to form the primitive digestion cavity, and the remainder becomes the
ectoderm.

The centrolycethal type of segmentation presents great variations in the different
groups of Arthropods, but in nearly all cases its peculiarities are 80 well marked

* The whole snbject of segmentation has been 80 ably and exhanstively reviewed by BALFOUR in his
recent work on * Comparative Embryology,” that it does not seem necessary to burden this paper with
a long lisb of references to the literature of Arthropod segmentation, or to enter into an exposition of the
present state of our knowledge of the snbject. All the exsential facts and opinions may be found on
pages 79-99, 317-379, and 425-433 of vol. i. of the * Comparative Embryology.”


70 MR. W. K. BROOKS ON LUCIFER:

that it is difficult to trace any resemblance to the various forms of segmentation which
occur in other groups of animals. In Lucifer the case is reversed, and we have a type
of segmentation which is obviously similar to that of the Echinoderms, Annelids,
Molluscs, Tunicates, Vertebrates, &c., but is less obviously related to that of the eggs
of closely allied forms. The resemblance to what may be called © normal ” segmenta-
tion is 80 plain that it need not be dwelt upon, but the relation between the egg of
Lneifer and an ordinary centrolycethal egg is by no means clear.
