It is known that such a mixture-is effused through an aperture in a fine plate in a time
which is as the 8quare root of the density of the mixture, and therefore nearly the arith-
metical mean of the two gases effused separately. But in transpiration by a capillary, a
mixture of 95 hydrogen and 5 air requires a considerably longer time than the gases
transpired separately. In fact 5 per cent. of air retards the transpiration of hydrogen
nearly as much as 20 per cent. of air would retard the effusion of hydrogen *. Now the
mixture in question permeates the graphite plate in 527-5 seconds, while the calculated
mean of the times of the two gases is 562-1 8econds. The mixture has therefore passed neither in the effusion time, nor in a longer time
