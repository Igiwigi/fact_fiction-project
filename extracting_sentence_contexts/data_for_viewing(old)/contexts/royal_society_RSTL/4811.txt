iO No further explanation regarding phenomena which depend on terrestrial
magnetism 1s required in the present chapter; but, as the facts have been Stated in
part, it may be right to complete the statement, as far as regards the action expe-
rienced by a magnet of any kind when held in different positions in a given locality,
by mentioning the following conclusions, deduced in a very obvious manner from
the general laws of magnetic action stated below, and verified fully by experiment.

If a magnet be held with its magnetic axis inclined at any angle to the line of dip,
it will experience a couple, the moment of which is proportional to the sine of the
angle of inclination, acting in a plane containing the magnetic axis and the line of
dip. The poxition of equilibrium towards which this couple tends to bring the mag-
netic axis is Stable, and if the direction of the magnetic axis be reversed, the body
may be left balanced, but it will be in unstable equilibrium.
