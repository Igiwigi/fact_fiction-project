431.). R. WaeneR observed that the ova of certain animals in which originally there is only
one $pot, at a later period present a number ; and he conjectured that this might be

what takes place in the mammiferous oyum, that this conjecture was very near the

of the same physiologist, namely, that the number of spots in some instances increase
as the ovum ripens. 434. Â© In Birds
