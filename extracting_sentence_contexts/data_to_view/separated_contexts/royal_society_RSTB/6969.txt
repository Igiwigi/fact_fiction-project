OF LINKAGE IN POLYSOMIC INHERITANCE 81 When three genes are present at each locus, the only possible component of deficiency is
that common to the bisimplex and the biduplex digenic types and, in fact, the smallest of
the three sets trigenic at both loci in table 19 has a matrix deficient in this component. The
two remaining sets, of eighteen and thirty-six genotypes respectively, are not in any way
deficient, having gametic matrices of rank 11. This is true also for the conjugate pair of sets of thirty-six genotypes having three genes
at one locus and four at the other (table 20).
