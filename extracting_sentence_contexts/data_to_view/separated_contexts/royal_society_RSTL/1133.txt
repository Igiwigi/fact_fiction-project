Reasoning
from analogy, the probability is, that the urine of frogs and
toads in general is of a similar nature, and altogether different
from that of the other amphibia. It is 8eJdom that any very abrupt  transitions are to be


of two species of the genus Rana. 99

.observed -in nature: the urinary organs of the turtle and
tortoise, Seem to be a connecting link between 'those of the
animals in question, and those-of serpents and lizards. Perhaps additional facts are not required to prove, that
the-secretion.of the kidneys of animals depends more on the
intimate and -invisible structure of these organs, than on the
kind of food the animals consume ; were such facts wanting,
there would be no difficulty in furnishing them. How dif-
ferent is the urine of the brown-toad and that of any species
of small lizards ! yet flies are the favourite and common diet
of both animals. Other remarkable instances might be men-
tioned, of similarity of diet and difference of urinary secretion ;
and, vice versa, instances might be afforded of difference of
diet and similarity of urine : I will mention one only ; it is that
of parrots and snakes ; their urine, as I have found, being
much the same, consisting chiefly of uric acid, though their
diet is altogether different, the birds feeding entirely on vege-
table matter, and the reptiles entirely on animal matter, But
let me not be supposed to maintain that the urinary secretion
depends entirely on the organ, quite independent of the nature
of the food or of the blood, from which the elements of the
urine are derived.
