Pecopteris unita.

THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS BASED UPON CoMPARISON OF Fosstt AND Moprern
MARATTIACE.

Certain theoretical questions may now be discussed on the basis of such data as
have been collected in the preceding pages. But in so very ancient a family it will
be readily believed that finality of opinion will be difficult to attain, and we can
hardly look for actual demonstration ; it will be necessary to be satisfied with a
consideration of probabilities.

As regards the distribution of the sori on the sporophyll we note as facts of interest,
among the fossils described as belonging to the Marattiacew, that in certain cases the
sori appear not to be segregated (Myriotheca), in others they are not clearly defined
(Grand Eurya), while in all the living genera they are commonly isolated on the
under surface of the leaf. But even here they are not always strictly defined, for
