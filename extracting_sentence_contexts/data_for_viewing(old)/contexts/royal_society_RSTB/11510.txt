the applied drug [15,28,29]. It is evident that this approach
does not disclose which biochemical mechanisms in the brain
are responsible for changes in psychological responses.

Pharmacological challenge tests (here called Approach 2)
have also been adopted from psychiatry and follow a similar
approach as above, but use a biochemical drug response as a
marker of a hidden disposition of susceptibility of a tempe-
rament trait. That is, they serve as a diagnostic tool for
detecting a disposition, which is invisible in unstimulated
conditions, just like an allergy test.

They make use of the fact that TMs in the limbic system
act on hypothalamic peptide-releasing hormones, which
induce pituitary hormones such as prolactin (PRL), growth
hormone (GH) and glandotropic hormones like ACTH, lead-
ing to cortisol release. These hormones can be measured in
blood or saliva and can serve as indicators of TM activity
(electronic supplementary material, S1). Examples of chal-
lenges of the three most behaviourally relevant TM systems
DA, 5-HT and NE [31 p. 654] (electronic supplementary
material, S2) demonstrated that each of these three systems
can be manipulated at several steps from synthesis to degra-
dation, that in many cases the same drug may elicit several
different hormone responses, and that the systems can be tar-
