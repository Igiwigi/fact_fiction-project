I remarked, however,
* By means of the comparison ..... there is no difficulty in computing for any other line
the correction that ought to be applied to the wave-length in the principal Tables, in
order to exhibit the true wave-lengths on D1TsCHEISER's scale, without appreciable
error,‚Äù

Want of leisure long prevented me from entering upon the examination necessary for
preparing, in a form easy for applications, the correction which my numbers required. Lately, however, I have taken it up; and I have constructed a Table of corrections to
the numbers of my Table generally, and I have applied them, both to the general Table
of wave-lengths and to the values of wave-lengths for the spectral lines of the atmo-
sphere and several metals (the accurate exhibition of which was, in fact, the first object
of my computations). I now offer these corrections and corrected numbers for the
acceptance of the Royal Society. The work of comparison and correction was conducted by a graphical process.
