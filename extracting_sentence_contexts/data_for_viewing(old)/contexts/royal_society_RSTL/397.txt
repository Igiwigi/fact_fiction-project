212 Sir Humpury Davy's experiments on a s0lid

As I have called*the compounds of oxygene, iodine, and
bases, oxy:odes, I venture to propose a name in conformity,
that of ozyiodine for the new solid compound, and ozyiodic .
acid, for the acid compound{ it forms with water. M. Gay
Lussac, as I am informed, has proposed jn a paper which I
have not yet been so fortunate as to procure, but which is said
to contain many new and important facts, the name of jodic
acid for the compound of ox ygene and iodine, the existence of
which he conceived he had proved by his experiment on the
action of sulphuric acid on the oxyiode of barium, and the
terms iodats for the substances, consisting of oxygene, iodine,
and bases. Iam willing to pay every compliment to the 8aga-
city of this ingenious chemist, in anticipating the knowledge
of the nature of a body, the separate existence of which he
had not demonstrated by experiment ; but the term zodic acid
does not appear to me sufficiently definite. For the hydro-
jonic acid, and the chlorionic acid, as well as the oxyiodic
acid, may be all called as a class iodic acids, or acids from
iodine, and the termination in at, would place the oxyiodes in
