Saw and Kinsr long ago, remarked (Nova Acta, tom. xiii.) on the carnivorous propen-
sities of these animals; and on Professor ROLLESTON placing an earthworm, killed by
immersion in warm water, in a dish in which were a number of living Planaric torve
and Dendrocela lactea, these animals crowded on to the worm's body and s00n sucked
all the hzxmoglobin out of it, leaving it white and pulpy.

Dr. Levy remarked that from the tail end of Rhynchodemus 8ylvaticus is secreted a
delicate mucous thread ; and Sir J. DALYELL (loc. cit. vol. ii. p. 113) observed of Planaria
Arethusa that it makes threads of mucus, by means of which it suspends itself in the
water. Bipalium in the same manner uses a thread of its tough investing slime for
8uspension in air; and I have frequently seen it let itself down in this manner from a
twig held at a short distance from the ground. The cellar-slug makes use of a slime-
thread for suspension in the same manner. This fact in the habits of Pipalium does
not seem to haye been noticed by M. HuMBerr, although he gives a very interesting
account of that animal's mode of life in his memoir (Mem. Soc. Phys. de Geneve, xvi.

1861, p. 294). BPipalium, as is observed by this author, when moving carries its head
slightly elevated, and moyes it from side to ide, evidently investigating with it any
obstacles which occur in the line of movement. When the semilunar head is thus
made use of, there are projected from its narroy anterior border tentacular-like eminences,
which appear to be used as feelers. The tentacles are evidently not localized, but may
be formed at. any spot, on the border of the head by contraction of surrounding tissue.
