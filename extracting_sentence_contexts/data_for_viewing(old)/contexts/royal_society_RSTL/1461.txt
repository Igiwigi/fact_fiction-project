pale coloured vapour, and with the other I turned the revoly-
ing plate five or six times, by which means the doubler became
electrified positively ; which was known to be at that time the
general electrical state of the atmosphere. The doubler was
now lowered, and placed upon the dung; and here also it be-
came charged by a few turns of the revolving plate, which
made me suspect that I had not completely cleared the doubler

of its former charge; however, on trial it was found to be elec-
trified negatively. This remarkable fact fully satisfied me that
I had not deceived myself in the first experiment on the heap
of leaves above mentioned.

I repeated these experiments, with the doubler placed on
various parts of the dunghill, without any remarkable variation
in the results, except that the negative state of the exhaled
vapour was stronger, and extended to a greater distance, in the
depressed or hollow parts of the dung, where the vapour was
less exposed to a moderate gale of wind that then prevailed,
than on the open parts which lay full to it. I have reason to
be of opinion, that the negative state of the vapour on the
windward side of the dung did not reach so high as the re-
