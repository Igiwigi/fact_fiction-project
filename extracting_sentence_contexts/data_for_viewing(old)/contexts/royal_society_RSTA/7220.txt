means that the area of the ‘initiations curve’ for the mixture with grit must be proportional to
the area of the curve for the standard explosive. Algebraically it follows that the average
probability of additional initiations by grit is directly proportional to the average probability
of initiation without grit. Presumably similar mechanisms are involved.

The additional falling off observed on comparing figure 31 with figure 32 is due to the
fact that the less sensitive high explosives also propagate less well. A compact presentation
of this fact is obtained from the extent to which the percentage sensitization (P.S.G.) figures
fall below the percentage initiation (P.I.G.) in table 31. When the two figures are identical,
propagation is practically complete under the conditions of confinement of the standard
test. When the P.S.G. falls below the P.I.G. propagation is less complete.

(c) MECHANISM OF SENSITIZATION BY GRIT
Probability of initiation by grit

In order to discuss the mechanism of sensitization, the simplifying assumption may be
made that caps containing a mixture of grit and explosive, which detonate as the result of
impact may be separated into two distinct groups, each with a distinct mechanism of
initiation: (a) caps detonating through true ‘impact’; (b) caps detonating due to the
