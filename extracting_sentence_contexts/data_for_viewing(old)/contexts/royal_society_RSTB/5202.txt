parachordals in Lepidosiren and Protopterus (AGAR, 1908, p. 50), after them in the
Selachians (SewERTZOFF, 1899, GoopRIcH, 1918, WisHE, 1922) and in Polypterus ;
in Acipenser the two elements are said to arise simultaneously (GauPP, 1906).

In Teleosts the trabecule always unite directly with the anterior ends of the para-
chordals, but in certain other fishes a pair of independent polar cartilages* at first lie
between these two elements, and later fuse with them to complete the chondrocranial
floor. These cartilages were first described in Squalus} (WIJHE, 1905, p. 319; 1922,
p- 280), and have been found also in Lepidosteus, where they have the form of short
rods, and- occupy exactly the same position as those of the Selachian fish (Verr, 1911,
p- 28). No independent polar cartilages are developed in Amia, but their homologues
may be recognised in the broadened, plate-like posterior ends of the trabecule (PEHRSON,
1922, p. 3). This homology is further strengthened by the fact that these plate-like
expansions bear the same relation to the déveloping external rectus eye-muscles as do
the polar cartilages of Squalus and Lepidosteus.t

I do not regard these polar cartilages as morphologically independent elements, but
rather as parts of the trabecular (or parachordal ?) tracts, which, in certain fishes, have
acquired a separate centre of chondrification.§ Such independent chondrification
may be connected with the early development of the rectus muscles and the need for a
firm basis for their support.

In connection with the relative positions of the trabecule and parachordals, and the
manner of their fusion, Sewrerrzorr (1899, p. 316) has introduced the terms
