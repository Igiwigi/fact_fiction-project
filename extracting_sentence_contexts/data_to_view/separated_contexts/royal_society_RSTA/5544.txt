above small difference may be taken to indicate that isoprene is not a true

Be the most probable formula for this hydrocarbon,
Methyl Todidle.—The difference between the theoretical and caleulated values for
@isthyl iodide is considerably above the average. This is no doubt due to the fuct that methy] iodide is a substituted methine; ib is,
