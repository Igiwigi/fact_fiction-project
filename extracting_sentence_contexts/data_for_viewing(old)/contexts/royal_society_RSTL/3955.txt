Let it be remembered, however, that in composing these piles, it is impossible not
to put the current which parts from the internal surface of the muscle in circulation,
for which reason a pile should be made analogous to that of the balf frogs divided at
the upper balf of the thigh (fig. 6.). Observation has shown, from the time of
GarLvani, that the points of the leg of the frog to be touched, for the purpose of pro-
ducing the proper contraction, are the points of insertion of the snrface of the funi-
cular tendon of the gemellus or gastrocnemius muscle into the calcaneum.

In one experiment, described at page 105, I had endeavoured to remove the tendi-
nous surface of the muscles of the legs, then composing the pile with the frogs 80
prepared, I had the current as at first, that is, directed from the feet to the head, in
the animal. This experiment, however, did not prove that the proper current exists
independently of the tendinous surface of the muscle ; in fact, removing the tendon,
I lay bare the muscle, and s0 doing prepare a muscular pile, in which the current,
being directed from the interior to the exterior of the muscle, is therefore in the same
direction as the proper current.

The following are the experiments which led me to generalize the fact of the proper
current of the frog. There is no difficulty in preparing the gemellus or gastrocne-
mius muscle of the frog, leaving a certain portion of the funicular tendon, or tendo
Achillis, which goes on to insert itself into the calcaneum, and taking care to avoid as
far as is possible injuring the upper part of the muscle. I prepared a great number of
these elements, and arranged them in a pile, as represented in Plate IV. fig. 9, in such
a manner that the tendinous extremity came in contact with the belly of the muscle.
From this pile I obtained signs of a current directed in the muscle from the tendon
