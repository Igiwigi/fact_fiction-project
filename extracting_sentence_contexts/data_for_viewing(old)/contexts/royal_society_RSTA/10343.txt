as to leave this 1 centim. of the fibre lying transversely between the glass tubes.

About 1 millim. of the end nearest to the observer of this piece of the fibre is then
turned up at right angles to its length by means of a very small gas flame. This

turned-up end serves as an index for counting the revolutions of the fibre. It is
viewed by means of a horizontal microscope not shown in the figure. The table D
has next to be adjusted in height and in horizontality until the fibre rolls quite freely
on sliding the table F along its guides. When once these adjustments have been
made they serve for the whole fibre—in fact, until it becomes necessary to renew the
glass capillary tubes on account of their becoming dirty. The small table D is covered
with a glass shade which extends over the tubes A and B and protects them from
dust (see fig. 3).

The Zeiss scale is 1 centim. in length. It is divided into millimetres, the last of
which is subdivided into tenths. The scale was standardised by comparison with the
standard metre of the Laboratory, several centimetres of the latter being measured in
terms of the Zeiss scale at a temperature of 15° C. The agreement, after the
necessary temperature corrections had been made, was within the limits of experimental
error, and the scale was therefore taken to be correct at 15°C. The temperature of
the scale during the measurements of the radii of the fibres was noted, but the
temperature corrections to the length of the scale were always too small to be
