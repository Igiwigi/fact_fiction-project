Along with function ¢ ,(f), we will consider also function y,(f), which is defined as

Ww(H=eaha’ -1 (3.13)

The properties of these functions are given in appendix A (d). For example, property 2 says
that g(t) > A” and w,(t) > 0as t ov. This fact suggests the existence of a steady-state solution
under condition of the existence of the finite limit of the function C(t) as t > 00. Using expression (3.13) for evaluating the right-hand side of equation (3.12) gives

a ct t
2 | C(X, t)ga(t — t)dt = A’ C(t, X) + AY” 2 | C(X, t)Wy (f — t)dr. (3.14)

Laplace transform of the function w, (t) can be obtained by using property 1 from appendix A (d),

a rt
L E I, C(X, t)Wy(t oar] =L{C] (+ + 1)" - 1 ~ yLCl=, ass—> 0, (3.15)

where L[C] = f° C(t, X)e~ dt. Accounting for the correlation (3.15) and properties of Laplace transform yields

4 ct :

From (3.14) and (3.16), it follows that for big t:
