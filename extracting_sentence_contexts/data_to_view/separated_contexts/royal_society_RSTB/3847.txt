being in fact nz. This is to say, considering a pure line as a population by itself,
the deviations of the parents from the population mean were not inherited at all. In 1909 he gives the correlation between parent and offspring for such a population
of 712 beans, all descended from a single ancestor; as —0°018 + 0°038, i.e. of no

by selection.
