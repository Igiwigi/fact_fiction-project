(1914) also states that codling moth larvae may enter diapause owing to overfeeding,
a condition certainly not brought about by unfavourable environmental conditions,

This brings up the question as to the exact definition of ‘favourable conditions’. In
general the term has a vague significance but lacks scientific precision. Each stage of each
insect has a set of conditions that is more favourable for rapid and successful growth than
others, but these conditions vary with the stage of the insect and the particular aspect of its
life that is being considered. For example, given a generally ‘favourable’ environment it is
of advantage, for the long-term increase of the species, that all individuals should emerge
without the incidence of diapause. It is clear that increase of the numbers of the species
would be favoured by this. Thus one could postulate that a diet of cane-sugar alone was
favourable to Cryptus even though egg-production of individual females was lowered and
their adult life was considerably less, facts which would indicate that conditions were
definitely unfavourable. Although, in general, it is obvious what is meant by favourable or
unfavourable conditions these terms must be accepted with caution, and both their
immediate and ‘long-term’ effects considered.

The possible genetical background that has been postulated in a number of examples of
diapause may now be considered in the light of the above. Obviously, in a general way,
the rate of physiological activity in a developing organism depends on its reactions to
environmental influences, and this reaction is governed broadly to the same extent as
morphological characters by the genetic constitution of the individual. In the same way as
with morphological characters there will be minor genotypic and phenotypic variations
between individuals in their general developmental physiology, in speed of development,
and in their reaction to the environment. This in turn will resolve itself into a variable
