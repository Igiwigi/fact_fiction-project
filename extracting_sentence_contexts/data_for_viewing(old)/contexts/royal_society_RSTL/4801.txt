approach the periphery. In the bones of matured individuals these two layers are more
or less united by the production of cancellated cavities and canals, which pass from
the one to the other through the intervening cartilage. In the first instance these have
merely been open spaces, produced by the partial absorption of the cartilage; but they
have s00n become lined with a membrane, which, as in fig. 397, has been converted
into bone by a calcification of its lamellae, chondriform bone being produced at the
Same time in the contiguous cartilage. I have especially observed these secondary
bone-growths to be developed in the centre of the parietals and alisphenoids.

In the supracccipital, the modes of increment are the same as in the bones just
described, only throughout the greater part of this bone there has existed a very
marked difference in the development of the superior and inferior osseous layers.
Whilst the former is of considerable thickness, the latter is very thin. This fact
prepared me for the existence of a till more marked difference in the case of the

frontal. The greater part of this bone consists of an expansion of the upper layer
only. The lower layer is developed, but to a very small degree, and that chiefly in
the central portions of the bone. In some parts of the periphery, the thin mem-
braniform structure appears to rest, not upon its own proper cartilaginous matrix,
but upon that of one of the contiguous subjacent bones.
