Figure 4. William Odling's periodic table of 1864, featuring 57 elements, displaying the reversal of Te and | and making a
separation between what are today referred to as the transition elements in order to highlight the greater similarity among
main group elements.

as figure 4 and which included 57 elements at a time when Newlands was only including
24 elements [14].

Also, unlike de Chancourtois and Newlands, Odling had attended the Karlsruhe meeting and
would have had first-hand exposure to the liberating views of Cannizzaro. In fact, on his return
to England Odling became one of the strongest advocates of Cannizaro’s approach to chemistry.



Perhaps he regarded himself in more of a hand-maiden role than as somebody at the forefront of
major discoveries concerning the elements. The fact remains that Odling’s work also failed to have
much impact on the scientific community of the day and that Odling did not pursue the discovery
further. Another possible cause for Odling’s failure to develop his periodic system might be that
he was more interested in the fundamental science rather than in developing what at the time
must have seemed like mere classification.?
