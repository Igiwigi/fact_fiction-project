a second-order nonlinear differential equation equipped with non-local boundary conditions
(1.4), see ยง3 for the detailed derivation. A significant part of this work is devoted to studying the
boundary value problem (1.4) and (1.5). In contrast to initial value problems that typically arise
when studying mathematical epidemiology, boundary value problems are much more difficult
to deal with. For instance, it is well known that a small change in the boundary conditions may
lead to significant changes in the behaviour of the solutions [20]. In fact, there is no general theory
to the existence and uniqueness of a solution for boundary value problems. In most instances,
we have to study the boundary value problem on a case-by-case basis, especially when the
problem at hand is nonlinear, and/or the boundary conditions are atypical, which is the case
with our problem as the boundary condition (1.4) is given in a non-local integral form. Non-
local boundary conditions have been studied in the past in various forms, recently appearing
in the study and application of fractional differential equations [21]. In our case, the non-local
boundary conditions correspond to fixing the values of certain integrals of the solution over given
time intervals, which is similar to how the average value is imposed on certain boundary value
problems with Neumann boundary conditions to ensure uniqueness of the solution. Although
this form is convenient for the analysis, we note that we can convert the integral conditions to
