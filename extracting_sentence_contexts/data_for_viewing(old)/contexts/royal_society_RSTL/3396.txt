226 MR. AIRY ON THE THEORETICAL EXPLANATION OF

I mention these matters merely for the purpose of showing distinetly that the obser-
vation of the facts was with me long anterior to the explanation, and that therefore
no leaning in favour of the theory can have warped my judgment in the perception
of experimental facts not wholly coinciding with Sir David Brewsrer's. Indeed, I
should never have thought of opposing my evidence on a matter of obseryation to
that of the Father of Modern Experimental Optics, unless the reasons for disagree-
ment were not only, in my judgment, well-grounded, but also unmingled and inde-
pendent.

'The facts, then, as I have observed them, are as follows :

1. When a prismatic spectrum is viewed, out of focus, bands are formed by placing
a piece of mica of a proper thickness (indefinite within wide limits) to cover
that half of the pupil of the eye, which is on the same side as the violet end of the
spectrum.

2. No bands are formed with any thickness of mica if it is placed on the same side
as the red end of the spectrum.

3. When the eye is too far off to see the spectrum distinctly ; then, upon passing
the mica before the eye from the violet end of the spectrum, bands are seen advancing
in the same direction over the spectrum.
