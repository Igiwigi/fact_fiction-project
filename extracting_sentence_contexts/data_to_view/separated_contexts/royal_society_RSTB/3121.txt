In the oogonium
this relation is maintained until preparation for mitosis leads to the withdrawal
of the perinucleolar chromatin. In the young oocyte the gradual subdivision and
more equa] distribution of the chromatin which accompanies the increasing meta-
bolism of the growing cell more speedily leads to the same result. The fact that
in the young oocyte, at a stage which can be but very little removed from the
anaphase stages of the preceding oogonial division, there should already be a
relatively large nucleolus surrounded by a thin layer representing the whole of the
chromatin of the cell emphasises the importance of this relation between the nucleolus
and the chromatin. It is evident, however, that though this arrangement may
facilitate, it cannot be essential to, the formation of the nucleolar substance, for in the
growing oocyte the nucleolus more than trebles its diameter after it has lost all direct
relation with the chromatin. The later behaviour of the nucleolus in the oocyte of Antedon offers, on the
other hand, considerable evidence of a highly suggestive character relative to the
significance of this structure in the cell-metabolism, One of the most.
