no cretins are to be seen, and the mother of one of the chil-
dren told me, of, her own accard, without my. asking the
question, that her, child was quite a di≈øferent, being when he
was up the mountain, as she called it, for a few. days.

The production of cretinism, by the bad quality of the air
and the food, the neglect of moral education, and other evils
attendant upon poverty, is supported by facts so- pointed, that
the greater number of cases in mountainous districts where
snow-water abounds, may safely be ascribed to these general
causes. The notion of snaw-water being the cause of goitre,
and consequently of cretinism, seems to have. been derived
from PLixy_ (Lib. II. cap. g7,) and copied by almost every
succeeding writer, because it coincided with their hypotheses
of cold and crude matters, although directly contradicted by
facts. In the first place, persons born in places contiguous to
the glaciers, who drink no, other water than what flows from
the melting of ice and snow, are not subject to this disorder ;
and, secondly, the disorder is observed in places where snow
is unknown.
