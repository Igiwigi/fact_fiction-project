centimetre of rain are roughly of the same order as determined by other investigators
from the records for non-thunderstorm rain as well as rain associated with thunder-
storms, which may or may not have passed overhead. In some thunderstorms the
amount of positively charged rain was greater than that of negatively charged rain,
while in others it was less. Taking the average of the nine storms, we see that the
amount of negatively charged rain was greater than that of positively charged rain,
but the amount of average positive charge per cubic centimetre of rain was very nearly
equal to that of average negative charge per cubic centimetre of rain. On the average,
therefore, each square centimetre of ground received 0-22 els. unit of negative charge
and 0-19 els. unit of positive charge during the passage of a thundercloud. The “ heat ”
thunderstorm, which develops on the mainland to the east of the Observatory, covers
an area which is limited by the coast line and the Western Ghats. Considering this
fact and assuming that the average life of a storm is double the average time taken by
it to pass over the station, we shall probably not be far out if we estimate that an area
of about (100 kmn.)? receives charge at the rate given above. We thus obtain the result
that on the average each thunderstorm transfers to the ground a total positive charge
oi about 6 x 10% coulombs and a total negative charge of about 7 x 10° coulombs.
The number of overhead thunderclouds from which this result is deduced is very small.
Should further observations of thunderstorms moving overhead confirm the above
