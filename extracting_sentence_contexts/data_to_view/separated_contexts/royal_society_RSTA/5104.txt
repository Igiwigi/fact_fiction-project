magnetizing forces as the residual magnetism is increased. That there is a partic
value of the residual magnetism, which gives greatest steepness of the reversal of
magnetization curve, is possible, but it is not here considered established. The int
pretation of the results, with reference to this point, is somewhat complicated by
fact that Foucault currents no doubt produce considerable shifting of the position
the point of maximum, as indicated by the apparent magnetizing current. currents may also modify the value of the maximum coefficient. This point wi
