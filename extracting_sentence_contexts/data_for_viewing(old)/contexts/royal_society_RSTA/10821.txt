MR. J, H. JEANS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR ENERGY, 407

These equations are not independent ; when they are added together the resulting
equation vanishes identically in virtue of the fact that the mean total energy is,
under all circumstances, unchanged by collisions.

Hence the equations can all be satisfied when the variables E,, E,... K are ina
definite ratio. The distribution of energy indicated by this ratio will therefore be
permanent, and since the equations which determine it are linear, it will be unique.
This is the distribution discovered by Borrzmawy, in which the energy is equally
divided between the various degrees of freedom.

Continuity of Path.

$11. Any of the coefficients in the above system of equations may vanish; so that
a it will be possible for the equations to fall into two groups, in such a way that no
