In every part of the grey substance of the spinal chord they are also very abundant, and often resemble
exactly the formative cells of elastic tissue.

+ T have chosen this part for an enlarged representation, because it is the point where nearly all the mot
important changes in the structure of the medulla are seen at the same time, and in close connexion with
each other. The details were observed under powers varying from 150 to 420 diameters, without any pressure
or displacement, whatever. Z

& It is stated by STILLISG, in his new work on the spinal chord (Neue Untersuchungen, Erste Lieferung,
P-20), that I was directed by Bowxax to the discovery of these cells. This is a mistake, but one, perhaps,
which might not unreasonably follow from the wording of my own note (Philosophical Transactions, 1851,
Part IT. p. 614). However, the fact is, that having observed this structure around the spinal canal, with-
out deciding on its nature, I pointed it out to Mr. BowMAN, who then suggested that, perhaps, it was
epithelium, which on further examination in a perfectly fresh state, I found to be the case.
