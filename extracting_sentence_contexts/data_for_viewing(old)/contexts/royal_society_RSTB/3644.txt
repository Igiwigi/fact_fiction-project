Smaller yellow granules, which react in a similar way to those above mentioned,
are found in the giant cells aggregated into one or two excentrically placed masses
or forming an indefinite zone around the whole or a portion of the nucleus. Similar
minute yellow granules are present in many of the ganglion cells, usually at the end
of the cell opposite the axone. A small amount of fat is usually associated with these

. yellow granules which, consequently, stain red with Sudan or Scharlach ; but fat is
possibly not an essential constituent of the yellow granules; under certain conditions
it appears to be almost wanting, and, when present, may form merely an enveloping film.

The substance and pigment of the yellow granules present in the giant and ganglion
cells are closely similar to, if not identical with, those of the chlorogogen granules, a
fact which indicates that the granules in the nerve cells are probably insoluble
products of metabolism (pp. 454-462).

5. Small rounded granules, which stain blue with methylene or toluidin blue, are
present in the cytoplasm of the giant cells, except in a peripheral zone of varying
width in different cells, in which they are absent or very sparse. These chromo-
philous bodies, which are not aggregated into clusters or flakes as in many vertebrate
nerve cells, are present in varying amount in the cells of different specimens, and
