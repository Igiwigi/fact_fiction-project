2. Competition and population density

A number of workers have laid stress on the great reduction in fly populations by com-
petition and on the part parasitism plays in rendering competition less effective. The fact

has apparently been overlooked that competition, by itself, cannot result in a stabilized fly
population, and that the outcome of competition itself produces the phenomenon attributed
to parasitism. Intense competition, in reducing the survival value of a larval population, gives rise to
a small population of flies which are probably below average size. These will lay compara-
tively few eggs, so that the carrion they find will be less crowded with their progeny.
