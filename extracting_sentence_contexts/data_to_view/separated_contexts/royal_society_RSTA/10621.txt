The great difference
between the solid and cored ares lies in the much greater quickness with which the
conditions of the former can vary, corresponding to any change, however small, in
the current through the are. The relative sluggishness of the cored are is probably
due to the presence in its vapour column of saline matter derived from the core. The fact that the solid are has a negative power-factor at frequencies below the
critical frequency of 1950 â€” indicates that the are is under these conditions supplying
power to the alternating current circuit, and that this is the fact can easily be shown
experimentally by connecting a wattmeter so as to measure the power supplied to
the solid are by the alternating current, when it will be found that at low frequencies
the solid are is actually supplying power to the alternate-current circuit, while at
Srequencies above the critical value the alternate-current circuit supplies power to the
are. This observation is of course not in any way at variance with the principle
of conservation of energy, since the alternating energy given out by the are is

derived from the direct-current energy supplied to it, the are acting as a converter. This fact, that the solid are is capable, under suitable conditions, of automatically
transforming energy derived from a source of direct current into alternate-current
energy of any frequency over a wide range, is the explanation of the transformation
of energy observed in the Musical Are recently shown for the first time at the
Institution of Electrical Engineers.*
