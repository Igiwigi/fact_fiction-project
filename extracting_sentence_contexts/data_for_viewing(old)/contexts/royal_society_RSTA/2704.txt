Figure 12. AS rate, ras, as a function of the time elapsed since MS, tas — tus, for experiments (a) and simulations (6). The
curves are scaled by the productivity Nas as proposed by equation (5.4). The different curves stand for the different types of
avalanches: acoustic events (green pentagons, (a)), events detected on the numerical u(t) signal (blue circles, (b)), events
detected on the numerical spatio-temporal map v(z, t) (red right-facing triangles, (b)). All curves have been fitted using
equation (5.4) (dashed lines). The obtained fitting parameters are: 7°2, = 2.83 x 10-° + 136 x 1076, 7%, =93 +52

and Pea = 1.17 + 0.02; ty}, = 8.45 x 10-3 4.86 x 1073, Tax >> 10 and ppg = 1.75 + 0.11. In the experimental case
(a), the points are obtained by superimposing data with different Sys. In all cases, the avalanche size threshold is fixed as

avalanches, also. Let us finally mention that equation (5.4) is not fulfilled for the local avalanches
detected on the space-time numerical maps (figure 12b); this is coherent with the fact that inter-
event times were not scale free for this type of avalanche, either.

6. Concluding discussion

We examined here the crackling dynamics in a nominally brittle crack problem. Experimentally,
a single crack was slowly pushed into an artificial rock made of sintered polymer beads. An
irregular burst-like dynamics is evidenced at the global scale, made of successive depinning
jumps spanning a variety of sizes. The area swept by each of these jumps, their duration and
the overall energy released during the event is power-law distributed, over several orders of
magnitude. Despite their individual giant fluctuations, the ratio between instantaneous, spatially
averaged, crack speed and power release remains fairly constant and defines a continuum-level
material constant fracture energy.
