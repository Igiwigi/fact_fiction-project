This meteorite had been examined some time back in the British Museum Laboratory
with a very different result, and the discrepancies between this result and those as well
of RAMMELSBERG as of Vox HAUER induced me to have the analysis confirmed by further
investigation. The conclusion, however, to which these experiments have led till leave
the discrepancy where it was. In fact the selection out of the debris of the meteorite
of the different ingredient minerals, or what seemed to be such, had at first led to the
belief that it might indeed consist, first, of a grey silicate; secondly, a more mottled
grey and possibly mingled mineral; and thirdly, chromite, which is present in consider-
able quantity, and often in very perfect crystals. An analysis, however, of the mixed
Silicates gave a result so nearly in accordance with that of a definite enstatite, that the
view seemed hardly tenable. Furthermore, the analysis of the mottled variety gave as
its result that this mineral is no other than bronzite.
