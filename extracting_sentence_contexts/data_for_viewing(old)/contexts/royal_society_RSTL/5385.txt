IN a note dated April 18th, 1853, which was added to my last paper on the
* Impregnation of the Ovum+F,” whilst it was printing, I recorded the fact that,
* through the adoption of a different mode of examination” from that which I had
previously employed, I had 'seen the spermatozoon pass through the gelatinous
covering and the vitelline membrane of the egg into the vitelline chamber and the
yelk. This fact of the penetration of the spermatozoon into the yelk is of such im-
portance as to make 1t necessary for me to state, with precision, all the circumstances
connected with it, and to detail the exact course I have pursued. These particulars
were not given when I announced the fact, because they would have exceeded the
limits of a supplementary note ; but as the omission of them has exposed my state-
ment to considerable doubt on the part of one of the most distinguished and truthful
of physiologists (Professor Biscaorrf), it is the more necessary that I now detail pre-
cisely my mode of proceedingyh. I think it will then appear, that the difficulties which
bave hitherto prevented a solution of the question of the penetration of the egg of the
Frog by the spermatozoon are in chief part, if not entirely overcome, and that this
egg, far from being the least fitted, is perhaps one of those best adapted for arriving

and the rest has been compiled from his Note Books. None of the observations were made later than the Spring
of 1853.—G.V.E.]
