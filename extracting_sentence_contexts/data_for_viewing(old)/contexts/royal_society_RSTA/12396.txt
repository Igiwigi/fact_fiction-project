deposit is formed on the zinc. This deposit is mainly mercury.* On removing it
from the zinc the E.M.F. rises; the same is the case on substituting an amalgamated
zine for the original one; but it is not clear whether this happens because some
action of the nature of amalgamation is required to prevent slight impurities in the
zine sulphate from having an injurious effect, or because even with a pure zine and
mercurous sulphate solution an amalgamated surface is required, or again, because the
action which has led to the formation of the grey deposit has removed from the
solution injurious impurities. These points are still under examination.

We are also inclined to think that a trace of acidity in the solutions is useful in
preventing the formation of the grey deposit ; on this point also we are continuing the
work.t The slight acidity in time corrects itself by its action on the zinc. The
important fact remains that the formation of this grey deposit must be, as far
as possible, prevented, and, if it does form, the deposit must be removed.

The experience of Dr. Scuuster with regard to this grey deposit somewhat
resembles our own. He has kindly sent us the results of measurements of a set of
rather large cells prepared from commercial sulphate.

Soon after being set up these cells were tested against some cells made two years
since, Taking the E.M.F, of this set as unity, the new cells were as follows :â€”

* It is only necessary to dip the grey covered zinc rods for a moment in a dilute acid to obtain a
bright amalgamated surface ; no fresh mercury is required. Dr. Scuuster informs us in a letter that
he has analysed the grey deposit, and found it to be nearly pure mercury.
