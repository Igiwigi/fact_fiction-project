In detailed studies, mainly on fatigued polycrystalline stainless steel (which
may not be comparable to copper!) by AFM, Man ef al. [33] have found some indications of
intrusions which are very narrow and small compared with the extrusions. The observations
deviate in some details from the predictions of Polak’s model, as summarized recently [50]. The
experimental evidence confirms essentially that the formation of extrusions is the dominant effect
and suggests that ‘intrusions’ are in fact embryonic stage I shear cracks that form as a consequence
of the previously formed extrusions. As an example of more recent modelling of cyclic strain
localization and fatigue crack initiation in PSBs, reference is made to the work of Sangid [51]. In addition to stage I shear cracks, also intercrystalline cracks are induced at grain boundary
(GB) sites, where PSBs impinge.
