While I know of
vhich present a real obstacle to the acceptance of the hypothesis, a large
of facts relating to external form, internal structure, and development, which
een discussed in previous pages, fall in with the theory. In the absence of
tensive and more direct evidence, therefore, the whole question before us
-e so many problems relating to descent) resolve itself in great measure into
e of probabilities. In view of the facts as a whole, it seems to me at present
le that the strobilus of the Hquisetinee and Lycopodinee is the counterpart of a
Hial head, such as that seen in the Bryophyta ; that it attained its present
by partial sterilization of the originally continuous archesporium, and out-
f the isolated parts, together with external protective tissues, as sporangia,
sre were also formed, probably simultaneously, appendicular organs (sporangio-
d sporophylls), which bear them. That in certain cases (Psilotaceze and
lg Equisetineze) the original sporangia underwent a further subdivision, by
â€˜ign of sterile septa, the result being synangia of various types. Tsoetes, and
K% Lepidodendron, are to be taken as examples of such sterilization resulting in
ji in place of complete septa.
