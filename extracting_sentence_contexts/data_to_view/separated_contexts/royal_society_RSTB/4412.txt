Wricur (1914, p. 39) remarks that the bedding is “ frequently quite undisturbed.”
The levels are inconsistent with the river theory as advocated for Ireland, for if the
canyons had been cut through the ice to the ground, the rivers could not have flowed
in an opposite direction to the slope of the land. It has been pointed out, as by Newperry (1878, p. 41), that some of the American
eskers occupy “a topographical position, which makes it impossible that they should
ever have been the beds of rivers,” as they cross or even lie along the divides. The
fact that the Irish eskers are independent of the slope of the country is fatal to the
view that they were deposited in rivers flowing through open glacial canyons. Observed variations in level would, on the other hand, naturally occur in marginal
deposits along the edge of an ice sheet resting on an undulating surface.
