tion, we know that when the radicle is still quite young, and as yet has formed no
root-hairs, direct infection from without is perfectly easy and certain. This at once
suggests that the organism can only penetrate the wall of the hair, when it is in a
merely incipient stage. That such is not the whole truth at any rate, is suggested

by certain observations which I made while studying the nature of the root-hair tube.
In many root-hairs which had already reached their full size, tubes were present,
which had but just begun to grow down the hair, or had not yet penetrated through
its whole length. Similarly, in other fully formed hairs, infection had only just
oceurred, and the infection spot and inflated tip alone were evidences of the fact. On
the contrary, I have also noted several very small root-hairs, scarcely larger than the
cell from which they arose, penetrated by infection tubes which had already reached
and entered the outer layer of the root-cells.

We are evidently confronted here by a difficult physiological problem as to the
conditions which regulate the entrance of these organisms. Is it a case of chemio-
taxis, depending upon certain variations in the composition of the excreta from the
root-hairs ; or does it result from the production by the invading organism itself of
some form of ferment capable of dissolving the cell-wall; or again, is it a question
of some special state of external conditions, which react either upon the organism or
upon the roots, such as the chemical composition of the air surrounding the root-
hairs, its degree of humidity, temperature, and so forth? Another possible cause
