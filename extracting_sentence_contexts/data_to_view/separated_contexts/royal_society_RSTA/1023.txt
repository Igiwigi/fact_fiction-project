Note that only the gradient on the
left-hand side and the first term on the right-hand side of the first equation have components in
the z-direction. The two-dimensional nature of the problem and the fact that the divergence of the velocity is
zero guarantees the existence of a streamfunction y such that

Next, on calculating the curl of the conservation of linear momentum (3.28) and substituting
the streamfunction (3.29) yields

where the symbol A? stands for the biharmonic operator. The boundary conditions arise naturally
by virtue of the definition of y and also from the fact that the boundary itself is also a streamline. Note that this is a linear PDE for y with the function G given from the previous step of the
axial flow. In particular, if the exponent n = 0, the function G becomes constant and the equation
reduces to a biharmonic equation and the solution for y is constant, which we can pick to be zero.
