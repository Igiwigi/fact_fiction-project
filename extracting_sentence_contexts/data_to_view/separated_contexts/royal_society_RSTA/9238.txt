Thus the solution is expressed by
(X, Y) = Q(ap+bq) (X°, Y°),
where Q(ap+bq) is of the form

1+aQp+bQq+aQpQp+ab (QpQ¢+ QqQp) +H°QqQ7+..-,

and we have proved that this series is uniformly and absolutely convergent. If we assume such a form of solution it is easy by successive steps to obtain the
values of the coefficients independently of the method we have adopted. What is of
present importance is that we have shown the series to be convergent, a fact which
appears to be denied by Pornoarn. VOL. CCOXVI.—a. 4
