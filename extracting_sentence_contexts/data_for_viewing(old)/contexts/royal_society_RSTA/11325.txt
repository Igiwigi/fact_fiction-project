stirred bath of highly insulating oil, into which the mercury thermometer is placed
directly, thus rendering the measurement of the coil-temperature much more certain.*

-V. Construction oF THE New APPARATUS.

As it was anticipated that the experiments at Sevres might occupy some time, and
it was not thought advisable that the Observatory should be deprived altogether of
the use of platinum thermometers for a long period by this apparatus being taken to
France, a new resistance-box was ordered specially for this work. The construction
of this box was entrusted by the Committee to Messrs. Crompron and Co., Limited,
and its behaviour has on the whole been very satisfactory.

Tn view of the fact that it was not easy to maintain the platinum-silver coils at a
sufficiently uniform temperature winter and summer by any simple means, and in
view of the difficulty previously mentioned as to the indication of the true coil-
temperature with sufficient accuracy by a mercurial thermometer, it was decided in
