We have sometimes
Fought that a different set of lines appeared there, but the measurement and inter-
Fetation of the northern line present some difficulties. In the firs place the spectrum
& the corona is much fainter, and secondly the spectrum of the prominences is much
onger. Most of the prominence lines, like H and K, stretch across the moon's
Hisc, and therefore also across the corona, Amongst the number of lines we have
easured it would not be difficult to point to some coincidences with the lines
S 8pectra of known bodies, but other equally strong lines of the same bodies seem
S be wanting, and we do not feel ourselves justified in suggesting any more than
rp coincidence,
Another feature of the photograph is the fact that the FRauNnorrR (dark) lines
ub G are clearly distinguishable in the coronal spectrum. About this region of
the spectrum the photographic action attains its maximum, and it is in this locality
that we should naturally first look for evidence of reflected solar light. That a small
fraction of the coronal light is reflected light of this nature is now without doubt
established, the photographic evidences being complete.
