basic marginal granite described above. The “ heathen” consist mainly of a felted
mass of plagioclase and orthoclase felspars. Quartz is, as a rule, only present as an
interstitial constituent of minor importance, but occasionally it takes on a pecilitic
habit as in the basic granite. Dark minerals were abundant and were originally
represented by hornblende which was quite allotriomorphic, not idiomorphic as in the
basic granite. The hornblende is now entirely replaced by chlorite in the specimens
examined. In fact the minerals in the “heathen” always present the appearance of
being more “ weathered” than the corresponding minerals in the matrix. The plagio-
clase is, curiously enough, represented by albite or albite-oligoclase clouded by
secondary products and possibly itself being of secondary origin. Along the junction
with the normal granite large orthoclase crystals may extend from the matrix into
the “heathen,” and then become packed with small inclusions of plagioclase and of
ragged chlorite after hornblende. One half of such an orthoclase may belong to the
coarse matrix and be free from inclusions, while the other half is in the “ heathen”
and is full of inclusions.

Tron-ores are mainly represented by magnetite which has a habit similar to that in
the normal granite, except that the magnetites in the heathen are smaller and some-
times, but not invariably so, more abundant than those in the granite. The amount
