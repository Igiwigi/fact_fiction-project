In the account which follows, the complete set of curves and tables of results are
given for a few only of the metals experimented on. These serve as examples of the
method of experimenting and as models of the results obtained. It would be well to remark here that only in a few instances was more than one
specimen of the metal in question experimented on, The values given for the rigidity
modulus and its temperature coefficient would be only approximately true for any
other specimen, for it is a well-established fact that the values of the rigidity modulus
of any substance given by different specimens of the same material are not the same. The cases in which more than one sample was experimented on were those in which
the “time effect” was least, as it seemed possible that in these cases the temperature
