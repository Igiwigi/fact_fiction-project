When the extremity of this thread was made the medium of
communication through water, I found that the mere current
of electricity would occasion a stream of very small bubbles to
rise from the extremity of the gold, although the wire, by which
it communicated with the positive or negative conductor, was

placed in absolute contact with them.- Hence iit- appears, [that
decomposition of water may take place by:common electricity,
as well as by the electric pile, although no discernible Sparks are
produced. The appearance of two currents of air may also be innltgted;
by occasioning the electricity- to pass by fine: points of com-
munication on both sides of the water; but, in fact, the resem-
blance is not complete; for, in every way in which I have tried
it, I observed that each wire gave both oxygen and hydrogen
gas, instead of their being formed separately, as by the electric
pile. I am inclined to attribute the difference in this respect, to the
greater intensity with which it is necessary to employ common
electricity ; for, that positive and negative electricity, so excited,
have each the same chemical power as they are observed to have
in the electric pile, may be ascertained by other means. In the precipitation of copper by silver, an instance of de-
oxidation (or phlogistication) by negative electricity has been
mentioned: the oxidating power of positive electricity-may be
also proved, by its effect on vegetable blue colours. '
