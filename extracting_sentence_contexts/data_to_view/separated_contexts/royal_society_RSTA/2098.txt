[25]°, by ‘dressing’ $(x) to give a new operator (x) that also creates the gravitational field
associated with a particle created by $(x). Since @(x) creates a gravitational field, which extends to infinity, now generically [25]
[®(x), ®(y)] £0 for spacelike x-y. In fact the nonvanishing commutators match well to the ‘locality
bound’ that was proposed in [28-30], to characterize the regime where LOFT fails to be an accurate
description of physics. This shows that the fundamental gauge-invariant observables in gravity do not obey a
local algebra, and thus we must have some other mathematical structure on H, providing the
foundations of the theory. This ‘substrate’ is not clearly based on any underlying manifold
structure, despite what is commonly assumed.
