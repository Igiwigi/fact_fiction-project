We might have included this article in the first part of this
Paper, as a corollary of the former three; since rays that have
been separated by. the prism, and have still remained subject to
the laws of reflection and refraction, as has been shewn, could
not be otherwise than of different re≈ørangibility; but we have
something to say on this subject, which will be found much more
circumstantial and conclusive than what might have been drawn
as a consequence from our former experiments. However, to
begin with what has already been shewn, we find that two
degrees of heat were obtained from that part of the spectrum
which contains the violet rays, while the full red colour, on the
opposite side, gave no less than seven degrees ;* and'these facts
ascertain the different refrangibility of the rays which occasion
heat, as clearly as that of light is ascertained by the dispersion
and variety of the colours. For, whether the rays which occa-
sion heat be the same with those which occasion' the colours,
which is a case that our foregoing experiments have not ascer-
tained, the arguments for their different refrangibility rests on
the same foundation, namely, their being dispersed by the
prism ; and that of the rays of light being admitted, the different
