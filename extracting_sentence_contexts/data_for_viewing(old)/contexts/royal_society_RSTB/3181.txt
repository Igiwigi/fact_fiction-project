The acidophile staining reaction of the yolk nucleus in Molgula offers a striking
contrast to the invariably intensely basophile reaction of this structure in Antedon ;
according to Crampton, all basic stains, including Hermrnnatn’s iron-alum-
hematoxylin, cause the cytoplasm to be deeply stained while the yolk nucleus
remains unstained. This reaction was obtained after the use of several fixing
reagents, some of which, ¢.g., saturated sublimate, I have also used in the present
paper. The author notes that the basophile reaction of the cytoplasm, though
strongly marked in the younger ova, slowly fades away as growth advances. A
similar behaviour of the cytoplasm is described by Meap (1897) for the ova of
Cheetopterus, and by Grirren (1899) for those of Zirphzea. This resemblance in the
staining reaction of the general cytoplasm to that which I have described for Antedon
is considerably strengthened in the case of Molgula by the fact that in the latter
type “sublimate fixation so affected the yolk as to make it retain the hematoxylin
stain even after the chromatin became pale.”

In striking contrast to the rational mode of origin suggested, though tentatively,

by Crampton for the yolk nucleus of Molgula we have the accounts of MERTENS
(1895) for various birds and mammals, Crery (1895) for Distomum, Hennequy
(1893) for Syngnathus, and BAMBEKE (1898) for Pholeus, by which the yolk nucleus
is made to arise from a single small granule, which is ejected or budded off from the
