The results presented here suggest that GPU parallelization can enable flow fields and
particle disturbance in confined geometries to be precisely resolved; moreover the computational
framework should also enable swimming and transport in complex and dynamic environments
such as the female reproductive tract to be computed.

6. Discussion

The regularized stokeslet method provides a relatively elementary access point to numerical
simulation of the geometrically complex Stokes flows characterizing many microscale biological
systems. In this paper we reviewed the nearest-neighbour discretization approach, which
decouples the number of degrees of freedom from the quadrature process, hence controlling
the size of the linear system that needs to be solved. We then described the implementation
of this method on GPU-enabled hardware; the fact that the method is already based on linear
algebra operations means that only two lines of Matlab code needed to be added in order to
exploit GPU acceleration. Assessing the method on existing problems of calculating swimming
motion due to multiple sperm in a confined channel, and particle transport in a ciliated organ,
as well as new problems involving multiple undulatory swimmers in an infinite fluid, we
consistently observed at least an order of magnitude time reduction when using the GPU over
the CPU. We have also demonstrated the versatility of this method by assessing the problem of
predicting particle transport by multiple sperm swimming in a directed fashion between two
parallel plates. While we carried out some of the computations on an HPC cluster, we limited
our use to a single computational node per simulation. Further advances may be possible by
re-analysing the code and/or using a compiler, although our primary focus is simplicity of
implementation.
