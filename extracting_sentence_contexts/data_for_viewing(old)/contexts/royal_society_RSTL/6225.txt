Dibromide.â€”The occurrence of this salt among the products of the action of dibro-
mide of ethylene on triethylphosphine has already been mentioned in the introduction
to the experimental part of the memoir. On bringing together the materials in the
proportions indicated by the equation :

C, H, Br, + 2C; Hi, P = CH, P, Br,,

that is to say, one volume of dibromide of ethylene and three volumes of the phosphorus-
base, the diatomic compound is obtained, nearly in the theoretical quantity. It is dis-
tinguished from the monatomic product of the same reaction by its much greater solu-
bility even in absolute alcohol, from which it separates, only after almost complete
evaporation, in needles which are permanent in the air. In ether this salt is insoluble, as
are in fact most of the bromides of the phosphorus-bases, both monatomic and diatomic.
The dibromide obtained by the direct action of dibromide of ethylene on triethylphos-
phine always contains a small quantity of the monatomic bromide, from which it can
only be purified with great difficulty. And further, if the dibromide of ethylene has
not been carefully purified from adhering hydrobromic acid, the resulting salt is like-
wise contaminated with traces of the extremely soluble hydrobromate of the phospho-
rus-base, the presence of which likewise interferes very much with the purification of
the product. Lastly, the formation of oxide of triethylphosphine can never be entirely
avoided, even when the operation is conducted in an atmosphere of carbonic acid. To
obviate these inconveniences, the compound submitted to analysis was prepared by
saturating the hydrate, to be presently described, with hydrobromic acid.

1. 04837 grm. of bromide gave 07091 grm. of carbonic acid and 0:3543 grm. of water.
