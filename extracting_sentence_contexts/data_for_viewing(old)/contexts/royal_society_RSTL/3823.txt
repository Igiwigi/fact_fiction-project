The third case was also one of phosphatic calculus in an irritable bladder. The
s0lution of nitro-saccharate was used daily for a week, and retained for half an hour
at a time, not only without annoyance, but often with positive comfort. The gentle-
man, however, not having patience to await its action *on the calculus, nothing
further was ascertained,

It will be safficiently evident, from these mere outlines, that the cases themselves
were utterly unfavourable for testing the 11THoxNTRIPTIC powers of the solution : they
are, nevertheless, well-fitted to afford evidence of its being neither irritating nor
injurious, when introduced with proper restrictions into the bladder.

The establishment of the latter fact, although an important feature in the present,
communication, is not more $0 than the results which tend to denote the advantage
of using DECOMPONENTS, rather than solvents. The latter view of the subject reyeals
a class of mild, but effectual, agents hitherto untried, and points out a principle, the
application of which, I trust and anticipate, will lead to the discovery of similar
agents for the decomposition of the other varieties of calculi which afflict the human
race.

of various decomponents contained in the urine, &c., must be reserved for consideration elsewhere.
