It reaches
the surface by passing through the sulcus subcentralis posterior and supplies both
sides of the sulcus centralis and a part of the gyrus praecentralis above the area of the
middle central artery. Although in this specimen the terminal vessels to the gyrus
praecentralis could not be dissected out, the whole arrangement is so essentially
similar to that in the Chimpanzee that the identity of the sulci subcentralis posterior
and postcentralis inferior is definitely established. The facts become striking by comparing the arterial areas in this hemisphere with
those in Q.2788.R. and Q..2788.L. (Plate 30). In Q.2788.R. the distance between

the sulcus centralis and the posterior end of the fissure of Sylvius is again short, but
the lower end of the sulcus postcentralis inferior is interposed between the sulcus
centralis and the ascending limb of the fissure of Sylvius. The identity of the lower
end of the sulcus postcentralis inferior—here probably the sulcus postcentralis in-
ferior—is established by the position of the area of supply of the middle postcentral
branch of the middle cerebral artery.
