spermatozoa, when precisely the same mode is followed, and the same means and same
description and number of filter-papers are employed, as in the filtration of the seminal
fluid. The solution of these questions it was evident must tend to confirm or to
unsettle the previous conclusions. I first tried ink, and used a part of the identical
filtering-paper employed to separate the spermatozoa. The ink passed quickly and
freely through three filters without losing any of its intense black colour, and carried
with it only a very few extremely minute granules, much smaller in size than the
spermatozoa of the Frog; 80 that it seemed fair to conclude that the colour imbibed
by the ova from ink, in MM. PrevosT and Dumas experiment, was due to the admis-
sion of the chemically combined colours of the fluid, and not to an admission into
the texture of the egg-envelopes of solid particles held merely in suspension in the
fluid. Consequently this experiment seemed to negative the supposition that, from
the fact of the interior of the egg-covering becoming blackened, solid particles of
matter, equal in s8ize to the spermatozoa, must have penetrated into the envelope
during its expansion ; and there seemed less reason to believe that the spermatozoa,—
bodies very much larger than the ink-granules,—could enter it. Carmine was then
tried. A s0lution of this colour could scarcely be made to pass through even a single
filter. This seemed to be due chiefly to the fact that the greater proportion of the
colouring matter of the carmine used (the water colour pigment of artists) was com-
bined with gum and an earthy base, and consequently most of the colour was in

suspension rather than in chemical combination. When placed on a Single filter, the
