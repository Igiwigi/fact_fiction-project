Whereas if, as seems highly probable, the action between the molecules and the
gurface is closely analogous to that between a ball and an uneven but perfectly 8mooth
elastic surface, then for molecules approaching the surface at very small angles f wonld
be unity, while for those approaching in a manner nearly perpendicular f would be
zero, or nearly 80. The variation of f with the angle of approach can be of no particular moment 80
long as there is a, sufficient, thickness of gas between the gurface considered and any
surface which may be opposite, for in that, cage the mean angle of approach mus be
the same, whatever may be the condition of the gas. But when the gas is between
two surfaces, as in a tube, and these surfaces are 80 near that the molecules range
across the interval, then the fact that if small the angle of reflection (measnred from

the normal) will always be less than the angle of incidence, must cause the molecules
to assume directions more and more nearly perpendicular to the snrface as the tube
becomes narrower, until some limit is reached. The 6ase of a billiard ball started obliquely along the table will serve to illustrate
this. Each time the ball leaves the side cushions its path will be more nearly perpen-
dicular, and if it cond maintain its velocity, and the table was sufficiently long, it
would eventually be moving directly across the table.
