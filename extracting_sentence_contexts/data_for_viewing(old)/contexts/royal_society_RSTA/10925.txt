has now vanished or become unimportant. Oblique illumination shows, by the
position of the shadows, that the darker ingredient has been etched out below the
level of the lighter ground. Thus the darkening of the tin-rich phase is due to a
real attack by the etching reagent. ‘The pattern seen in these lower chills reminds
one of the alloys from C to D when chilled below the transformation curve. In both
cases there are ribands of a tin-rich material, often enclosing polygonal areas, and,
branching from these ribands, a fantastic crystallisation of the tin-rich phase
partly fills the enclosed areas. But in the CD alloys the ribands and fern-leat
crystallisation is left white and not attacked by the etching, while in the DE alloys
it is attacked and darkened ; in the CD alloys it is 8, in Sn 23 and Sn 24 it is 0:

Sn 24 is similar throughout to the above, with the exception that in the chills in
which the 4 phase appears it is more abundant; in fact, nearly filling the alloy,
Primaries and chill primaries are obtained by chilling above 700°, and between the
solidus and the transformation curve the chills are uniform when ignited ; but when
strongly etched show the iridescence and patchiness due to minute separations, while
as soon as the chilling temperature falls below the transformation curve, the solid
solution breaks up and the bars, or really plates of », nearly fill the field. We give
two photographs of Sn 24. The first (fig. 63) was a slow-cooled chill at 685°, that is,
a little below the solidus. It shows no primary, but is full of iridescence due to
minute linear separations ; there are also some long slender bars of », It may seem
