t to search at once for the longest elemental lines in the solar spectrum without waiting

( for a complete set of maps.
A preliminary search having been determined on, I endeavoured to get some guidance

h by seeing if there was any quality which differentiated the elements already traced in
| the 8m from those not traced; and to this end I requested my assistant, Mr. R. J.
b Friswerl, to prepare two lists showing broadly the chief chemical characteristics of the

þ elements traced and not traced, This was done by taking a number of the best known
' compounds of each element (such, for instance, as those formed with oxygen, sulphur,
chlorine, bromine, or hydrogen), stating after each whether the compounds in question
© were unstable or stable. Where any compound was known not to exist, that fact was
© indicated.

E Two Tables were thus prepared, one containing the solar, the other the more important
S non-80lar elements (according to our knowledge at the time).

5 These Tables gave me, as the differentiation s0ught, the fact that in the main the
j= known 8olar elements formed stable oxygen-compounds.

&b T have said in the main, because the differentiation was not absolute ; but it was sut-
