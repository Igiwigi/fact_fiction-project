severity. However, even for a 1 in 100-year storm, cross slope planting and woody debris cause
15% and 27% reductions, respectively.

Figure 6 demonstrates the ‘before’ and ‘after’ states of manholes in the Infoworks ICM model
to demonstrate the impact of NFM on the performance of the surface drainage network. In
the unaltered catchment, the 10-year storm led to inundation of the network, without causing
surcharging into the housing estate. However, the upstream NFM intervention removes any
surcharging within the urban system. The 15- and 20-year storms cause surface flooding in the
housing estate (of differing extents). In both cases, the upstream intervention removes any surface
flooding, although the system remains surcharged. Although there is still street flooding in the
33-year storm, the upstream interventions significantly reduce the maximum extent. This is very
interesting because in figure 5a, the 20- and 33-year storms are shown to prolong the time the
outfall is submerged. In fact, the attenuating impact of the interventions is delaying the pulse in
