But perhaps a more important deduction in the present paper (involved qualitatively
in the basic hypothesis of incompressibility) is the considerable local variation in pressure
in the membrane when the tooth is subjected to the forces arising in occlusion. This
has not, I think, been taken into consideration previously. 1 am not competent to
discuss the physiological consequences of such local variations in pressure, and shall
merely emphasise the fact that the application of a force of considerably less than
one pound weight may reduce the pressure to zero at some points in the membrane,
while raising it to two atmospheres at other points. In deducing numerical results
in this connection, the only data required are geometrical measurements of teeth ;
the rigidity drops out of the equations, as also does the thickness of the membrane. The weakest point in the argument is the assumption of uniform thickness of the
membrane, but we can at least hope to have obtained results of a rough quantitative
significance.
