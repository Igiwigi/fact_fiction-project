However, the operators A,,n>1
cannot converge strongly, since ||A,|| =1, and in particular do not converge to the zero operator. On the other hand, for any x €H, defining x, = eT &e;,n>1, we have limy-.0%, =x and
limn—oo AnXn = 0. This confirms the fact that the extended limit, and not the ‘normal’ limit, of
Ans is the limit semigroup generator.


4. Aversion with the limit semigroup defined on a subspace

In this section, for simplicity of notations and exposition, we assume that the semigroups
generated by A,,s are equibounded: ||T;,(¢)|| <M for some M > 1. The general case may be easily
reconstructed by standard techniques.
