It
is also suggested that the degenerating cells included in it resemble osteoblasts. There
are, however, no Haversian systems to be seen and no embryonic mesoderm cells which
might be developing into osteoblasts—on the contrary, all the pulp cells, so far from
undergoing mitosis, are admittedly degenerating, and it is difficult to see how any of
them could be mistaken for osteoblasts. The cells are, in fact, so degenerated that it
would seem impossible from their appearance alone to say what they had been. Even
if they did resemble osteoblasts the case would not be proved, for it has been shown
(Fisu, 1932, fig. 35, A) that such cells often appear associated with the development of
secondary dentine in the ordinary reactions of teeth in monkeys and other animals—
but only in an otherwise healthy pulp. The “ Pulp bone” theory presents a bewildering picture quite as inexplicable on
general biological grounds as it is unprecedented in any other form of pulp irritation,
and it leaves entirely out of account any reaction to the death of the primary dentine.
