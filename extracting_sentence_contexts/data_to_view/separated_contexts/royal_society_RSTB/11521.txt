Background

consciousness, subjective experience One of the main controversies in current consciousness research is the relation

between so-called phenomenal consciousness (subjective experience) and
Author for correspondence: access consciousness. This distinction was proposed by Block [1], and many
Morten Overgaard philosophical and scientific discussions revolve around it, as it essentially
involves how we should conceive of the relation between consciousness and
cognition. Classically, the debate is characterized by different positions: Block
himself has consistently argued that the two concepts can be empirically disso-
ciated [2-5], others argue that the two concepts, in fact, only refer to one
property [6], while others again seem to argue that they are conceptually
different but always empirically correlated [7]. This article focuses on the arguments for ‘overflow’—that phenomenal con-
sciousness (or P-consciousness) overflows access consciousness (A-consciousness). Obviously, in order to understand the meaning of ‘overflow’, one needs to have
relatively precise definitions of both A- and P-consciousness.
