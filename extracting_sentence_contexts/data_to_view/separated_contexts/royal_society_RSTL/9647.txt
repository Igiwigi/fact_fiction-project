these measure-
ments enable us to estimate the accuracy of the method. Red glass (coloured with
oxide of copper) was used in the game way, and two measures agreed in giving
the wave length as 615. In the case of the blue of the second order the difficulty
was much increased by the fact that the boundary of a colour 80 near the centre
of the rings is very irregular. If we except this tint, however, no measurement
ever differed from the mean of the measures on the same colour by more than
1:6 per cent. As three sets of measurements were taken at intervals of nine and
six months respectively, and as in most cases three, and in some five, observations
were made in each colour, it seems that the errors of recognition and measurement
combined did not (except in the case mentioned) exceed 1'6 per cent.
