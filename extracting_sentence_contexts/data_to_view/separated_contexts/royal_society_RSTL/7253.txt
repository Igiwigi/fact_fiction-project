The proof given in the preceding that DuLonG and PgTiT's law is not uniyer-
sally yalid, justifies certain conclusions, in reference to the nature of the 80-called
chemical elements, which may here be developed. What bodies are to be regarded as chemical elements? Does the mere fact of inde-
composability determine this? or may a body be indecomposable in point, of fact and yet
from reasons of analogy be regarded not as an element but as a compound ? The history
of chemistry furnishes numerous examples of cases in which sometimes one and s80me-

& times another mode of view led to results which at present are regarded as accurate.
