Unfortunately there is no means of
knowing to what extent the series of animals is a representative sample of the population. There was, of course, no selection in collecting, but it is impossible to know whether the
methods used favoured the capture of one sex rather than the other. If this is, in fact, an
indication of the true sex ratio, there is a very high proportion of males when compared
with the sex ratio of other animals. In the dog, the only carnivore in which the sexâ€™
ratio appears to be known, Parkes (1926) gives the sex ratio as 110-7 to 118-5 males per
100 females, a proportion of 52-8 to 54-3 % of males. It is of interest to notice that this
sex ratio is the highest known among domestic or laboratory animals, and, although it
refers to the ratio at birth, it may lend some support to the possibility that the high
male proportion in the present series may be an indication of the true sex ratio of the
population, in the area from which the animals were collected.
