It is, in general, useless to proceed to a third approximation, because the uncertainty

of the corrections is at least of the same order, as a rule.

The value of P, which may be called the “ corrected ” pressure, is obtained directly
arom the observations by applying the small corrections in the manner detailed below.
a P is proportional to the absolute temperature. The ratio 6)/p) is theoretically

SPiatant for each filling, though, as a matter of fact, it is variable with the “ zero-
@rrors’ > of the air thermometer. The value of @ is calculated from P by the aid of
Gogarithms, the logarithm of 0,/p, being tabulated once for all for each series of observa-
ions. This is the only part of the reductions where logarithms are required. The
Sorrection terms being, from their very nature, uncertain, often to the extent of nearly
2 per cent., it is quite sufficient to perform all the multiplications they involve by the
Bid of a small slide-rule giving results correct to 1 per 1000. This method saves
“trouble, paper, time, and mistakes.
