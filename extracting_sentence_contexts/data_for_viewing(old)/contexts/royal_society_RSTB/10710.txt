a recurring saccadic pattern (such as right, right, left, right, right,
left . . .) [56,57]. However, phenomena of this kind—obviously at
a higher hierarchical level than simple countermanding—are
not yet amenable to the same kinds of quantitative modelling,
and are not further discussed in this issue.

4. The difficulty of achieving stillness

One might well think that stopping, and maintaining stillness,
was simply a matter of turning off the excitatory commands to
muscles. But—apart from the special case of deep sleep, when
the body simply flops passively—this is absolutely not the
case. The reason is a peculiarity—in fact a defect—in the way
muscles work at a molecular level. Consider the two stationary

that since they are motionless, despite their weight, no work is but subject to random walk dynamics. This is particularly
performed in sustaining them. This is evidently true of the evident in the eye movements of fixation, where the resultant
