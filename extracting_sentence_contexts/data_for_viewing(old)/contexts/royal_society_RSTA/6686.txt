symmetrical rectangular wings of aspect ratio greater than 1/, there is no induced drag at
zero incidence. If the aerofoil is of chord c, then the decrement of drag due to the pressure
defect (53) may be written

hia (ae iat ‘ ACE, rz—ox a8
AD =f (z) def a \n (0) cos = i cos~ aan n(G ae

Introducing ex/z = ¢ in the first integral, and ax/(z—¢) = o in the second, we find

ADS =), cos! edo| f1'(2) dz (n'(0) +f9"© (2-0) de}

The result depends essentially on the fact that the excess pressure given in (51) is of the
cone-field type depending not on the distance of the point of measurement from the corner,
but on its angular position with reference to it. It will cease to hold when the aspect ratio is
less than 1/z. Some calculations have been made for this case, and it is found, for example,
that for a double-wedge aerofoil, aspect ratio 1/2, the drag is about two-thirds of that given
by the two-dimensional theory.

RECTANGULAR AEROFOILS—MORE GENERAL PROBLEMS

So far we have been considering, for the most part, problems of the ‘cone-field’ type—the
only exception being the prolongation of the solution for the flat plate at incidence. The
methods developed, however, permit the solution of more general problems. Before leaving
the case of rectangular plan aerofoils with leading edge normal to and tips parallel to
