‘The petioles in the peripheral zone of the trunk have their bundles placed tangentially,

if only the peripheral zone had been found preserved no one would seriously have

But now that the facts are known, a symmetrical
disposition of the peripheral leaves, irrespective of
their origin from one central axis or from “sie
centrally grouped ones, is not only found to be /
possible, but is even to be expected on mechanical é
and physiological grounds. Although the foliage
is not preserved, there is scarcely a doubt that
round the top of the “false stem ”’ these leaves of
mixed origin formed what may be called a “ false
crown.”

A little consideration will show that no twist in
the petioles is needed to reduce their irregular
