In these trials, however, the dry chloride was
corked up in the weighing flask while still warm ; for if allowed to cool in the
open air, it absorbs a little air and moisture, and then on being fused a slight
loss is perceptible. These experiments have been preferably made with chlo-
ride of silyer thrown down from the nitrate by muriatic. acid : the results are
Similar with any pure chloride ; but when precipitated by sea-salt, it is apt,
unless yery carefully washed, to retain a little chloride of sodium, and then I

believe the devyelopement of acid is more easy than when the chloride of silver
is quite pure. The foregoing experiments have given me the most perfect conviction that
my estimate of the constitution of hornsilver, deduced from the researches pub-
lished in my last Essay, is in no wise vitiated by the fact noticed by Dr. ProuT. But in order, on a point of s0 much practical and theoretical interest, not to
omit any evidence which might elucidate the subject, I endeavoured to analyse
corrosive sublimate by directly ascertaining the quantity of mercury which it
contains.
