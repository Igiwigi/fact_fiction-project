ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD. 121

Comparison of the curves in fig. 2 shows that this rise of the curve comes to an end
later and later with wider spacings. Further, whereas the curve of 1) ceases to rise
in the week ending on July 12, that of 1a—which represents a spacing of half
the 1b density—does not stop until the following week. Thus, the date at which
root-interference begins, with consequent limitation of growth rate by the available
soil water and nutrient salts, depends on the volume of soil available, as one would
expect.* In the widest sowing the curve is still rising when the curtailing effect
of the water table comes into operation ; with such spacings there is no rest at a
maximum, but in the close sowings the curve remains horizontal under the control
of this soil water limiting factor for several weeks. That this arresting factor is
not aérial may be further deduced from the fact that, on June 30, it is still
possible to see the soil between the plants in photographs taken from above ; since
the flower-bud takes not less than three weeks to develop into a flower, it follows
that the horizontal position which the curve of 1) takes up in the week ending
July 12 was determined in the week ending June 21, before aérial interference had
begun.

Comparison between the a and 6 series introduces a further complication. The
closest sowings of «@ and b may be explained as above, but in the wider sowings it is
evident that this explanation will not suffice. Comparing, for example, the curves ot
8a and 8b, they both have the same form, the maximum being attained at the same
time and lasting for the same time. The only difference is in the amplitude of the
curve, which is nearly twice as great in 8a as in 8b. Here we appear to be dealing
