on the dorsal region, and inferiorly on each side of the ambulacral line. In these
regions also the arrangement of its fibres is most complex : this arrangement is dis-
played diagrammatically in Plate X. fig. 13; a sort of basketwork of fibres running in
three directions is formed; and an almost exactly similar arrangement of fibres is
described as existing in the external muscular coat of higher worms, in the leech and
Nematodes, by LEUCKART (loc. cit. pp. 459, 645). When this muscular coat is viewed
from above, the fibres are seen crossing one another diagonally, whilst others take a
directly transverse or circular course (Plate XI, fig. 5).

The decussating fibres are thus doubly oblique in their direction. At the sides of
the body this muscular coat is almost entirely absent, and especially in Rhynchodemus
(Plate XI. fig. 2). The muscular coat appears to be almost homogeneous and structure-
less; in fact it exactly resembles the external coat of aquatic Planarians, such as Lepto-
plana tremellaris (Plate XTV. fig. 1, E. C. M.) or Dendrocelum lacteum (Plate XIV.
fig. 7, E. C. M.), though in this latter instance the external coat is more evidently mus-
cular. Now the remarkable arrangement of fibres which is common to both groups
being taken into consideration, there can be little doubt that the external circular
muscular coat here described in Bipalium and Rhynchodemus is the homologue of the
similar external coat of the leech; and it is evident that the external coat of Dendro-
celum lacteum answers to that of Bipalium, and that of Leptoplana tremellaris to that
of Dendrocelum lacteum. The body investments are essentially homologous ; but mus-
cular elements are developed in them more perfectly in some forms than in others, and
in some parts of some forms more perfectly than in other parts. In higher worms the
development of fibres is almost constantly perfect in all parts of the body. KEFERSTEIN
