Sn the bulb, so that there is relatively less radiation sent out in the form of the Sharp
series. But the nature of the reduction is very significant. For 7065 is reduced to
about to, 14713 only to 7, and A4121 only to 4%, so that the preferential transfer of
‘athe Sharp series energy is perhaps even more pronounced than that of the Diffuse
eeries. The only line of the Principal series in the region we have examined is \3888,
‘po that no conclusions can be drawn regarding it.
4 p the Diffuse series of Parhelium contains \\6678, 4388, 4144, corresponding to
= 3,4, 5,6 in the formula. This series exhibits the same phenomenon in a very
ED clonnted manner. For in the bulb spectrum \6678 is reduced to 4, but 4922
only to 4%, while the next member, 14388, is actually enhanced to 14, and the next,
4144, is even further enhanced to 1}. These are the other two lines mentioned
Jready in connection with their enhancement in nebule.
3 An even more striking fact in the same connection occurs with the Sharp series of
eParhelium. Its first visible member appears in our ordinary Helium spectrum, but is
OEE invisible in the wedge photograph from the bulb. This is the line 45047. But
‘Zthe next member. \4437, is visible in both, and is enhanced in the ratio 4°0 in the
bulb. The next member, \4169, is visible in the ordinary spectrum of the bulb,
Ethough not in the wedge photograph, and is quite invisible with the ordinary
gilischarge for the exposure given, even without the interposition of the wedge. This
Sis a significant illustration of the effectiveness of the wedge method for determining
ca rarinhions incapable of detection by visual methods. The absence of this line in the
Zordinary spectrum, and its presence in the bulb under the same conditions, might
Ahave been noticed by visual or ordinary photographic methods. But without the
present method of detecting comparatively small differences in order of intensity—
as estimated by ordinary and very unsensitive methods—it would have been
