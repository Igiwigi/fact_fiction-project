never applies weight restrictions to input clauses. Let us squeeze down to 33.

% Length of proof is 195.

% Level of proof is 29.

Here we are getting very close to the simplest proof we found above, but now a question
is raised. The earlier simple proof is only three steps shorter than this one, but this one has


a significantly smaller maximum clause weight (in fact, the non-input clauses have weight no
greater than 33). Perhaps this proof should be considered to be simpler than the earlier one?
Let us bypass this question by squeezing the maximum clause weight to 30.

% Length of proof is 183.

% Level of proof is 30.

Note that the level went up slightly, but the length is down quite a bit, so it is reasonable to say
that this proof is simpler than any that came before.
