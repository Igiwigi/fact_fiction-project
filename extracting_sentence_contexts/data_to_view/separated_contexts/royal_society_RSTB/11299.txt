Specifically, the regulation of TL is depen- programming of the telomere biology system. S

A model integrating telomere biology and mitochondrial
function has been suggested by several studies. In fact, 4
a telomere p53—mitochondrion axis may account for many
processes that have been implicated in pathophysiological — w

dent on the level of methylation in sub-telomeric regions of
the histones H3 and H4. The methylation of these histones
decreases access to telomere sequences and thus reduces
telomerase activity [196]. Hence, proteins such as DNA methyl-

transferase (that play a role in regulation of methylation) have ageing [22].
