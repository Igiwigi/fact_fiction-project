In parallel with his work leading towards likelihood, Fisher was exploring the notion of (what
we now think of as characterizing the frequentist school of statistics) evaluating estimators using
their sampling properties, such as the consistency and efficiency mentioned above. Eddington
claimed that the best estimator of the standard error of a normal distribution was the mean
of the absolute deviations. Fisher showed [12] that this was not the case, and in fact that
the mean of the squared deviations contained ‘the whole of the information respecting’ the
standard error. As he said in Fisher [1, p. 315]: ‘the discussions of theoretical statistics may be
regarded as alternating between problems of estimation and problems of distribution. In the first
place a method of calculating one of the population parameters is devised from common-sense
considerations: we next require to know its probable error, and therefore an approximate solution
of the distribution, in samples, of the statistic is calculated.
