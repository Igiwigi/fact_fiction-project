velocity in the ray polarized in the direction of greatest stress. Now this ray
corresponds to the ordinary ray if the glass be compared with a uniaxial crystal
whose optic axis is parallel to the direction of greatest stress.

The glass, therefore, produces the same effect as a positive uniaxial erystal so
placed.

This is, in fact, what does occur. This definition, therefore, agrees with the
earlier one.

Now, since (for this glass) 4, C, fy are all positive, it follows that if we are to have
a maximum followed by a minimum, as in fig. 10, d(Q/dT <0.

Now, in Q=Ne’r*/mm, since + does not change, the only quantity which can
change with the polarization is N, the number of electrons per unit volume.

dQ/dT is then er? (N.—N,)/7m(T.—T,), where N,, N, are the number of electrons
of period 7 which respond to vibrations in the directions of T, and T,.

Our result will, therefore, signify that a tensional stress decreases the number of
