if this curve be such that its Hessian breaks up into three lines, then
both the Pippian of the cubic zU+6BHU=0, and the Pippian of its Hessian will break
up into the same three points, which will be a portion of the curve of the sixth .class,
and discarding these three points the curve will nk down to one on the third class, and
will in fact be the Quippian of the cubic. MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 429
To show this we may take
«U+6ÞHU=a"+/*+=0
as the equation of the syzygetic cubic satisfying the prescribed condition, for this value

in fact gives
H(zU+68HU)=—ayz=0,

a system of three lines. We find, moreover,
P(#U+68HU)=P(a*+3*+2)=—Ent

P{6H(«U+6BHU)}=P(—6a2yz)=—4Ent,
the latter equation being obtained by first neglecting all but the highest power of 7 in
=yY expression of PU, and then writing {/=—1: we have als T(4U+6ÞHU)=1.
