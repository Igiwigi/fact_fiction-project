Verification of (4.5), for moderate amounts of oscillating shear (experimental data due to Sugerman et al. [13]). The 3S
large discrepancies occur close to the undeformed configuration for which the applied forces are small leading to the errors in a)

There is a further use of (4.5)2 in assessing the validity of constitutive assumptions: since
max(k/1+«?) =1/2 at « =1, it seems reasonable to require that all models satisfy

\T| <05, (4.6)

which is more restrictive on the allowable range of the stress ratio than the empirical restriction
(3.7) which was inferred from the experimental data of Janmey et al. [22]. The fact that many of
the flexible gels tested by Janmey et al. [22] violate (4.6) suggest that many of these gels are not
isotropic. The out-of-plane stress T33 and the hydrostatic stress H for the one-term Ogden model are,
respectively

Note that the out-of-plane normal stress is the negative of the normal traction under plane
stress conditions given in (3.3). Therefore, 1=6 is again optimal in that for this exponent
the out-of-plane stress is identically zero and the plots of |N| against amount of shear in
figure 1 will be exactly the same as plots of |T33/Tj2| here.
