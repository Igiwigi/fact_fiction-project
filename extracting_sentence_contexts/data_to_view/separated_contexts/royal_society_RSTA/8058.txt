And since any given distribution of excess fractions
in the five wave-lengths only recurs at intervals of 102 wave-lengths (taking as a criterion
agreement of observed and calculated fractions to within 0-15 of a fringe, whereas in
the groups of coincidences actually accepted in the present work agreement was found
in all cases to within 0-1 fringe), a knowledge of the absolute value to an accuracy of
only 1 part in 10,000 is sufficient to identify with certainty which particular group of
coincidences is to be taken. Thus the value finally obtained is entirely independent
of the absolute value provisionally assumed, provided only that the latter is not in error
by more than this amount. Properly regarded, therefore, the fact that the above
assumed values furnish satisfactory coincidences of fractions, which in turn lead to a
result in close agreement with the absolute value provisionally assumed for the red
radiation of cadmium, constitutes a complete justification of the procedure adopted. For the determination of its order of interference the first étalon was situated in its
normal position in the apparatus, but the eyepiece of the main telescope was removed
so that the real image of the circular interference fringes, produced in light transmitted
by the étalon, could be focussed on the wide slit of a spectrometer with camera attach-
ment. Diameters of five bright rings in each radiation were measured off the photo-
graphic plate (Ilford Soft Gradation Panchromatic) by a travelling microscope and
from these the values of the excess fractions were calculated by a least squares method
(Rour and Barrett, loc. cit.).
