The latter (2) belong to the interbedded basaltic lava and tuff series of the South
Soufri√©re Hill volcano, and overlie the pale tuffs (1) unconformably. The pale tuffs
were upraised, steeply tilted, and much broken up, and they had acquired an irregular
upper surface before the basic series covered them unconformably. These facts were
ascertained by inspection from below and from above, by descending the steep slope
of lava and tuff at Roche Bluff Point, and by climbing gullies in the cliffs to the north. Near Landing Bay the chaotic relations of bedding planes in adjacent masses of the
pale tuffs, make it obvious that the beds have been uptilted and broken. Locally,
rather sandy strata with vertical bedding strike along the beach near the cliff base;
a vertical junction between pale tuff and a mass of limestone extends at one place for
about 50 ft. up the cliff.
