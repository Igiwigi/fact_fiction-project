Such analogies become highly interesting when regarded in connection with
terrestrial electricity, magnetism, and heat ; for if it be granted that the two
Jatter increase in intensity at great depths in the earth, they are evidently
80 connected with electrical action that the augmentation of it also, in the
interior of the globe, may be reasonably inferred. However this may be, assuming that metalliferous veins exist more or less in
primitive rocks generally, (and experience favours this assumption, whether we

and South America, Siberia, Ireland, &c. or to the mining county of Cornwall,
in which whole districts have comparatively of late been found abounding
with mineral treasure, where none had been formerly suspected to exit.)
it may I think be presumed, that the electrical currents, which s0 affect
the needle in the galyanometer, may likewise influence the direction of the
magnetic needle on the surface of the earth : at least no explanation of this
phenomenon appears to be 80 plausible, or s0 well connected with ascertained
facts. Even the cause of the variations of the needle, mysterious as it has
hitherto appeared to be, may probably be referred to the relative energies of
the opposing electrical currents, which are perhaps subject to occasional modi-
fications ; and the appearance of earthquakes and volcanic action, from time
to time, seems to countenance the probability of such changes. Nor $hould it be overlooked in reference to this view of the subject, that the
oblique bearing which is generally obseryable in the strata and veins, with
respect to the equator, causes them, as it were, to cross at opposite sides of the
globe in the same parallels of latitude, so that their tendency, if any, must
necessarily be to produce more than one magnetic pole in each hemisphere.
