So far, these attempts, such as those discussed in §5, have concerned QFDT. This might, aes)
however, be changing [34]. :8
In reflecting on Heisenberg’s conception of these quantities, one might observe first that, in :3
order to invent a new concept of any kind, one has to construct a phenomenological entity or a set iS

of entities and relations among them. In physics, one must give this construction a mathematical
architecture, defining the corresponding mathematical model, with which one might start, as
Heisenberg in fact did, and which enables the theory to relate to observable phenomena and
measurable quantities associated with these phenomena. Heisenberg’s invention of his matrices
was made possible by his idea of arranging algebraic elements corresponding to numerical
quantities (transition probabilities) into infinite square tables. It is true that, once one deals
with the transitions between two stationary states, rather than with a description of such states,
matrices appear naturally, with rows and columns linked to each possible state, respectively.
