of nervous influence.

The object of the present Paper is to shew that the nerves
which accompany the arteries regulate their actions, and it is
through their agency that the blood is distributed in different
proportions to the different parts of the body.

The facts which have led me to conclude that this office is
performed by the nerves, I shall lay before the Society in the
order in which they occurred.

An officer, who had been wounded by a musket ball in the
leg immediately below the knee, came under my care. With
a view to find the ball, a seton was passed in the course it had
