It is very
large in the Crag of Suffolk, and in the Subapennine 'Fertiaries. Older than the
Secondary deposits, however, it is found in the Permian limestones of England and
Germany. It is common in the recent state from the Arctic Circle to the Line; in fact, geogra-
phically and geologically, it has a very large range. It occurs in many sandy shore-
deposits; but its favourite habitat is mud at 50-100 fathoms; and is continually met
with in the deepest sonndings, although never abundant there, and generally small. Nodosaria (Dentalina) consobrina, D'Orbigny.
