Furthermore, it is crucial to
highlight that the World Atlas provides estimates of cloud-
free Zenith brightness and does not vary with cloud cover. There are no currently available tools that would allow extra-
polation from the World Atlas and (for example) location-
specific estimates of low clouds and fog to create an estimate
of exposure. Thus, we believe that the fact of not incorporat-
ing cloud influences on skyglow does not affect our findings. It is also possible that we are missing important effects at
finer scales than those we employed in our study, but gather-
ing such data would require high-performing light meters
to be attached to mountain lions, which is not currently
feasible. Sky glow does not vary much at distances of
750m, while upward radiance does, so higher-resolution
night light data in lieu of the VIIRS data might have been
even more important to habitat selection, were that resolution
of data available.
