Thus the wide-mouthed Cones, as, for example, Conus geographicus, have no
operculum, whilst the other species have a distinct one: and the genera Cry-
ptostoma and Concholepas have very 8mall opercula, in comparison with the
Size of their mouths, whilst the other genera allied to them have their opercula
nearly as large as the mouths of their shells. The genus Fermetus is in this
respect yery remarkable : most of the species have the operculum as large as
the mouth of the shell; but there is one in the British Museum which has an
operculum very small in comparison to the size of the body of the animal, and
not one fourth part of the diameter of the tube of shell. Some species of this
genus, indeed, are described as having no operculum ; and the observation of
the above fact induces me to giye credit to the description which I was at first
inclined to doubt. But of all the yariations in this particular, those of Capulus and Zipponysz

are the most remarkable: some species appear always to haye an operculum,
which, like the under valye of Crania, differs in thickness according to the
form and degree of exposure of the substance to which it is attached :—others,
as the common Capulus Hungaricus, are generally without operculum, although,
according to the observations of Dr. Tuxrox, the last-named species sometimes
forms a thin support ;—and there are others which, instead of forming an oper-
culum, make for themselves (as has been already alluded to in this paper,) a
cavity in the substance of the shell to which they are affixed, which is marked
with a lunate ridge, corresponding with the muscular scar of the opercu-
lum, and doubtless occasioned by the attachment of the adductor muscle to
that part of the shell, which is thus protected from the dissolving power of
the mantle.
