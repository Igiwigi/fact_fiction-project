Various experimenters, from the time of Di SAUSSURE until quite recently, have enter-
tained the idea of the probability of the decomposition of nitrogenous compounds, and

the concomitant evolution of free Nitrogen, during the growth of plants. We are
ourselves engaged in following up the 8ubject, by methods better qualified to settle the
We

question than those adopted in regard to the question of assimilation of Nitrogen.
hall therefore not treat of this subject any further here, than to call attention to the
incidental bearing upon it of the results now under consideration. ;

The fact that there has been no decomposition of nitrogenous compounds and 1oss of
Nitrogen as the result of growth, in the particular conditions to which these experimental
plants were subjected, affords little eyidence that no 8uch decomposition could take

under any other cireumstances. When supplied with an insufficient quantity of

ous matter, the yegetable organism might not decompose any of that matter ;
4 yet, when an excess of combined Nitrogen was supplied, the decomposition might
