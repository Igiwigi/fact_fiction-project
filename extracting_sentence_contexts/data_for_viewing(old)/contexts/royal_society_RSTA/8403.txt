It is clear that the first step has reduced the equations to a form in which the B terms
are quite small in comparison with the A terms. To obtain a first approximation to the
A’s, the former are neglected pro tem. and the equations solved in the straightforward
way, introducing at the correct stage the equation of condition,

ZA, = 0,
Co
1.€.,

A, +A,+A;+A, = 0.

This expresses the fact that the 0 end of the final graph is to be brought down to the
zero line. [The C, calibrations which have involved the point 0 are Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.]
Having obtained the six first approximations to A, ... Ag, the next step is to perform
the same operation on the A’s in the determinant as was previously performed on the
B's, 7.e., the elimination of Ay in each pair of equations Na and N8, leaving a determinant
strong in B terms and weak in A terms (see underneath the main determinant).
