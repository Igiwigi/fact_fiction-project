* Minotaur” (as shown in Plate XVI. fig. 2 and Plate XVII. fig. 8) there are only two 8
tions, and this is the simplest case, besides being that which is most frequently met with,
In the *© Victoria and Albert” (as shown in figs. 1 & T) andin the © Bellerophon' (as ﬆhown
in Plate XVI. fig. 3 and Plate XVII. fig. 9) there are four water-borne sections, and
consequently four sections of maximum shearing. In the © Audacious,” when fully laden,
there are also four such sections (ee Plate XVI. figs. 4 and Plate XVII. 10); and.
in this case it is evident that, by transposing 40 or 50 tons weight from amidships
towards the extremities, keeping the ship's trim unaltered, the curve of weights might
be made to cross the curve of buoyancy in two other points, thus bringing up the number
of water-borne sections to 8ix. When the © Audacious* has only her engines and boilers |
on board, she is, in fact, in the conditions here referred to, the balanced or water-borne

sections being marked S' S', 8* $*, &c. in Plate XVI. fig. 6, and R' R', R* R?, &e. in Plate

XVII. fig. 11. We can also imagine a ship to be 80 loaded that there would be even a

greater number of water-borne sections than this ; and it appears, at first sight, difficult

to determine what law regulates the number of these sections. On an inspection of all

the cases we have given, however, it will be seen that the number of water-borne sections

is always even; and it appears probable that, at least in the greater number of ships
