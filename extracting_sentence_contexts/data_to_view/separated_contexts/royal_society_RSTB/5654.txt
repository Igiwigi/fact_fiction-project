The lower molars have four distinct cusps arranged in two rows, the internal
cusps are conical, and the external sub-crescentic. The third molar has a
strong bicuspid talonid. Several of these points are incorrect as to fact, and appear to have arisen from a consi-
deration of Owenâ€™s figures rather than from a close examination of the actual specimens. The cusps are certainly conical in shape, but not more so than can be seen in some
specimens of Hohippus. It has been shown above that there is at least the beginning
of a mesostyle in H. leporinum ; while the parastyle is quite as well developed as in
Eohippus or in Pachynolophus, its alleged absence being due to damage as has already
been described.
