The comparative incompetence of compound bodies to oscillate in yisual periods
has incessantly declared itself in these researches. I would here refer to a most interesting illustration of the
8ame kind, derived from the experiments of MA, Ds 1a ProvostarE and Desarxs, These distinguished experi-
menters were the first to record the important fact that the qualities of heat emitted by bodies at the same tem-
perature may be yery unlike. Two experiments illustrate this fact, The firs is recorded in the Comptes Rendus,
yol. xxxiv. p. 951, One half of a cube was coated with lampblack, and the other half with cinnabar. The cube
being filled with oil at a temperature of 173? C., it was found that the emission from the cinnabar was more
copiously absorbed by a plate of glass than that from the lampblack.
