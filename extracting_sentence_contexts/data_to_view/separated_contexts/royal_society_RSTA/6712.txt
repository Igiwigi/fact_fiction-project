The case is harder when the star has an interrupted arm parallel to Oz. There

are two possibilities, according as 8 lies within the boundary (figure 9a) or outside it
(figure 96). In relation to figure 9@ we have, corresponding with (i),

Xp = Ex + (1—£) Nos (iii)


RELAXATION METHODS APPLIED TO ENGINEERING PROBLEMS | 519

a denoting the length of the interrupted arm OP and 1 being a ‘fictitious point’; and
corresponding with the second of (ii)

also (dy/dr), is related with (0y/dz), by (11) B as before: but now in place of the first
of (ii) we must employ

oy
(5 al = &(x1 —Xe) + (1—&) (Xo —Xa)s (v)

as the closest approximation which is practicable. Substituting in (30) we have an
equation in which 7, & Wp, (v7) ps (v2) p are known, and between this and (28) y, may be
eliminated in the manner of § 21. When the point 8 is also ‘fictitious’ (figure 94), yg has also to be eliminated, and it is
difficult to obtain an independent expression for this quantity.
