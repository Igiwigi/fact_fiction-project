From ‘Atomic theory and mechanics’ on, Bohr always saw quantum El
physics as defined by the essential roles of both measuring and mathematical instruments, of
experimental and mathematical technologies, in their reciprocal relationships. The very appeal
to ‘instruments’ is hardly casual. Apart from the fact that such choices of expression are never
casual in Bohr, the point is consistent with Bohr’s view of mathematics, as also (although not
only) a technology of thought, specifically in physics [69]. Experimental technology is a broader concept than ‘measuring instruments’, and it would,
for example, involve devices that make it possible to apply the measuring instruments or
other devices. More generally, technology is a means of doing something, and doing it more
successfully than previously.
