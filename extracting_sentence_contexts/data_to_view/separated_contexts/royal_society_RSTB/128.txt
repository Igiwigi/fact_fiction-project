In
some cases an extremely close and almost overpowering odour was detected when the
carbonic acid amounted to only 7 or 8 volumes per 10,000, while in other cases
the smell was only slight with as much as 17 volumes, and in one case as much as 20
volumes. In these latter instances the organic matter was only slightly above the
limit we have allowed. The smell is, in fact, greatly influenced by the temperature, and also by the
humidity of the air, as Dz Cuaumont himself points out. The state of cleanliness
of the persons in the room, and of the room itself, has a most important influence on
the smell, quite independently of the amount of carbonic acid. There may also be
other strongly smelling substances in a room which do not appreciably affect the
chemical composition of the air.
