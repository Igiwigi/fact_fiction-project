certain extent, and thus keeping up the nutrition of the muscles or part of them,
accounts for the recovery in such cases as those of BARDENaEUER. It is not yet
definitely determined what length of time the muscles may be cut off from the
influence of the central nervous system and yet be reparable, but if it is found at
the operation that they are wholly unresponsive to direct galvanic stimulation the
prospects are not good, Examination of electrical reactions through the skin with
negative result is not conclusive proof that reactions are absent. It is necessary
to puncture the skin to permit a platinum electrode to reach the muscle substance
directly.

6. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.

If now the conclusions from the facts ascertained in this research may be shortly
reviewed, they are as follows :â€”

1. In any case of facial paralysis due to division or compression of the facial nerve,
the best procedure, should spontaneous recovery fail or be deemed impossible, is to
attempt restoration of the damaged nerve.

2, Should efficient restoration of the nerve be impossible, or be deemed impossible,
anastomosis with the spinal accessory or hypoglossal holds out most favourable
prospects of recovery, given that the facial muscles are still recoverable from the
point of view of duration of complete severance from the nutritive influence of the
central nervous system.
