methods tends to be the best-fit of an a priori analytic model (or one of a family of trialled models)
and is obtained with some difficulty and expense. These methods are included here primarily
as additional means to confirm the character of the nonlinearity (typically, by looking back at
the Characterization step from the later Location and Quantification steps which demand such
methods). The exception to this category is restoring force surfaces, which can give significant
(and, notably, non-parametric) insight into the character of the nonlinearity, but is a typically
single DOF analysis.

(iii) Location and quantification (Steps 6 and 7)

The existing methods for Location and Quantification of nonlinear features are essentially those
first mentioned as ‘other methods’ for Detection and Characterization of nonlinearities in the
previous sections. This follows from the fact that these methods are typically based on the trialled
parameters or the closest fit to an a priori analytic form. However, methods based on FRFs, time-
domain or time-frequency representations are of limited use for Location and Quantification
given that all DOFs will tend to exhibit some effects from the nonlinearity, and not necessarily
in an obvious or intuitive way.


We perceive location of hidden/previously unknown nonlinear features as a greater challenge
than the previous steps of Detection and Characterization, largely because the act of trying
to locate infers analysis of a multi-DOF system, and any nonlinear system which passed the
Detection stage will typically exhibit an influence of the nonlinearity at all DOFs—making
standard FRF, time-domain and time-frequency plots of limited use. Indeed, the measured DOFs
may be inadequate to be connected meaningfully by a representative nonlinear element.
