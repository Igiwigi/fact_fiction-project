Yet flight speeds in birds are only 0.7—
1.6 times those of typical wind speeds [4,5]. This is equivalent to a Boeing 747
having to operate in winds of some 780 kmh‘'. In fact, even though wind
speeds are a much lower proportion of the flight speeds of commercial aircraft
(the ratio of flight speed to flow speed is in the order of 9.7: 1), wind speed is

still a key determinant of fuel consumption, journey time and flight route. The fact that air is almost never still provides animals with potential opportu-
nities as well as challenges. Organisms from aphids to eagles time their flights in
order to exploit particular flow vectors [6,7], enabling them to travel with very low
energetic costs [8].
