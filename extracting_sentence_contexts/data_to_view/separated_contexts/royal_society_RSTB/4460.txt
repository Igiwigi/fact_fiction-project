So far as the Podocarpinew are concerned, PILGER
(1903, p. 36) has already drawn attention to the peculiarities of the New Caledonian
flora, which includes at least nine species of Podocarpinese hitherto recorded only
from that island. With the exception of Acmopyle, all of these plants are being
investigated by Mr. C. P. Durr, of Queen’s College, Cambridge. Mr. Durr was
kind enough to allow me to examine his preparations for comparison—a fact which
helped me considerably in my work on Acmopyle. In particular, I would like to
thank him for allowing me to reproduce in this paper a photograph (Plate 11, fig. 31),
of the stone of a new species of Podocarpus discovered by Prof. Compron in New
Caledonia. The material of Aemopyle was originally preserved mostly in formalin, but was
subsequently transferred to a mixture of alcohol and glycerine.
