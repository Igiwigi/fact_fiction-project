However, such
regulation currently is strongly favoured to explain the
formation of the rippling patterns. During rippling, synchro-
nized cellular waves move in opposite directions and appear
to traverse each other when they collide. In fact, cell tracking
experiments reveal that wave formation is an optical effect of
the cells reversing synchronously when cellular waves collide
and therefore adopting ‘accordion-like’ movements with the
appearance of travelling waves [6,23,29,46-48]. Mathematical
models suggest that signal transmission following head-to-
head cell contact in colliding waves could induce reversal
and explain the observed pattern [48]. Remarkably, the
model also requires a built-in refractory period (possibly pro-
vided by RomRX), necessary for the cells to effectively move
away from the collision sites.
