]. Introduction

Quantum thermodynamics [1-3] is of importance for its possible contributions to classical
thermodynamics in the non-equilibrium regime, in addition to its relevance to e.g. nanoscience
and quantum information. A point is the fact that an element of a classical system is
fundamentally described by a set of dynamical/thermodynamical variables, whereas in
quantum mechanics the Hilbert space also accompanies. This ‘double structure’ in quantum
thermodynamics leads to diversity of the bath concepts. A typical example is the dephasing
bath [4], the role of which is to realize decoherence of a quantum state and therefore has no
classical counterparts. As long as limited to classical equilibrium thermodynamics concerns, the
bath simply implies the heat bath. In non-equilibrium classical thermodynamics, however, a
situation becomes somewhat analogous to quantum thermodynamics if the kinetic approach is
employed, where both dynamical /thermodynamical variables and time evolution of a probability
distribution function of a system under consideration have to be treated.

Thermodynamic processes of interest are usually characterized by conserved values of
quantities and variables. Examples are the isothermal, isochoric, isobaric and isoentropic
