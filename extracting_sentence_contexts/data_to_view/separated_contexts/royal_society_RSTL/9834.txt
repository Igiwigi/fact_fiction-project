They are especially frequent over the basal aspect of the olfactory lobe and
along the limbic figsure, back even as far as the posterior extremity of the latter.


702 MR. W. BEVAN LEWIS ON THE COMPARATIVE

Upon separating the olfactory lobe from the frontal end of the hemisphere and
reflecting it backwards, we become aware of the fact that the frontal extremity is
obliquely truncated, sweeping forwards and upwards to the frontal pole, and thus
forming an oblique depression in which lies the opposed olfactory lobe. Into this part
of the hemisphere runs the upper or fourth olfactory fasciculus. If we direct our
attention to the base of the brain in the Rabbit, on the other hand, we observe that
the great limbic lobe does not, as in the Rat, conceal by its extension outwards the
extra-limbic portion of the hemisphere, a large portion of which projects on either 8ide
of the well-marked limbic fissxure.
