the simple tooth having not only a longitudinal furrow
exactly resembling the edges of the 5lit of the poisonous

fang, but also' a very visible cavity at the base, where the
foramen occurs in the others; and I have even found a fine
tube in a tooth of this sort; it was however confined to the
parietes, and did not affect the cavity of the tooth,

To this gradation from a slight superficial furrow to a deep
depression, may be added the fact, that no traces of either
are obseryable in the teeth of those serpents which are not
armed with venomous fangs : this I found to be the case in
a large species of boa. :

As a consequence of the structure that I have described, if
4 horizontal section be made of a poisonous fang, in which
the edges of the longitudinal depression are rounded, we
shall have a eylindrical cavity (the poison tube) nearly
Surrounded by a semilunar one (the cavity which contains
the pulp). This is shown in the annexed drawings of the
fangs of the cobra de capello. (PI. XXII. E. F.G. H.)
