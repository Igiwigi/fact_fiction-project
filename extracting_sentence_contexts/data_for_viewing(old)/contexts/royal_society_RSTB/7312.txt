At that time, the importance of the area surrounding the test object was not known. It
was not until Lythgoe (1932) proved the necessity of having an extensive background of
the same brightness as the test object that the effect of this in raising acuity was appreciated.
When this background is provided by the experimenter, greater acuities than before are
found for nearly, if not quite, all types of test object (Hecht & Mintz 1939). It was at once
clear that this would necessitate a revision of the 10 °%, difference of intensity proposed by
the author, and the adoption of some lower figure. It is important that this point should be
fully appreciated, for as these revised acuities are reported as the result of further research,
the idea seems to be prevalent that they refute the author’s theory (Hartridge 1922@). Such
is not the case, however; the value of the least perceptible intensity difference may need
revision from time to time, but the theory itself will remain unchallenged until some one
proves that resolution is in fact taking place when there are no differences of light intensity

to be perceived by the fovea.
