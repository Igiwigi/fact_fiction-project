The same is true of the ductule epithelium of the rabbit. There is no real difficulty,

however, under low or high power, in recognising the islets. They are seen to be
usually of rounded, compact form, and, at first sight, sharply marked off from the
surrounding secretory alveoli. With a high power many of the islets show a division
of the cells, by intervening connective tissue and blood capillaries, into packets which

have a shape strikingly similar to that of the secretory alveoli. In such, an outer
layer of larger cells can be distinguished from an inner layer of smaller cells, exactly
like centro-acinary cells. The appearance, in fact, is exactly that of a group of
alveoli in which the secreting cells have lost their characteristic basal basophil
staining and zymogen granules, their nuclei having become more centrally placed,
and assimilated to those of the centro-acinary cells, and in which the lumen has
become obliterated by a falling together of the cells. In most of such islets it can
also be seen that the sharp circumscription is only apparent, and is not due to a
capsule, as described by KtéHne and Lua. The divisions of the islet, of suggestive
alveolar shape as described above, can often be found actually continuous, beyond the
islet margin, with undoubted normal secreting alveoli, containing zymogen granules,
and staining characteristically both in cell-substance and nucleus.

In many islets the appearance of alveolar structure and of continuity with the
secretory tissue is not seen. In such islets the cell-substance is reduced, and the
