Proof. Let {px, 9} be a minimizing sequence in A, for the functional (5.11). By the coercivity of
the functional and the fact that A, is non-empty, together with the Poincaré inequality, it follows
that this sequence has bounded H! norm. So, it has a subsequence that converges weakly to
a limit (¢,p) ¢ H'(¢*, 5) x H1(Q) and, so, strongly in L?. Since Weap (5-11) is polyconvex, the
corresponding energy is weakly lower semicontinuous.
