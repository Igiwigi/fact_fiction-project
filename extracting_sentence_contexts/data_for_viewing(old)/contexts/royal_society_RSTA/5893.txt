and choose the centres x; â‚¬ D of the cubes in such a way that the cubes Q7,,, (x) are disjoint and,
setting Q; = Q),,(%n), we have

Mn>Cat?, vn. (3.5)

The existence of the sequences {x;} and {A,} as above is guaranteed by the fact that we can
inductively choose x; and 4, > 0 (small enough) to have

P\Uent >0, Yn.

k=1

The fact that D has been chosen to be bounded guarantees that {x;,} can be chosen to be a
convergent sequence and {Q7;,,(%n)} to be contained in a bounded set. We conclude that {Qn}
is our desired sequence of cubes.


Step 3. Choice of the sequence ty and conclusion. The lower bound (3.5) shows that the condition
(3.2) for the loss of regularity of the solution holds if

We recall condition (3.3) for the regularity of the velocity field
