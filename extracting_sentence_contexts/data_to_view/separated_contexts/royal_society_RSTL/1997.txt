The influence of coloured surfaces upon the absorption and emission of
odours, having, I trust, heen satisfactorily shown, it only remains for me to
state shortly some of the practical conclusions which may be drawn from the
experiments detailed. If it be thus certain that odorous emanations have not only a particular
affinity for different substances, but that the colour of those snbstances mate-
rially affects their absorbing or radiating quality; the knowledge of these facts
may afford useful hints for the preservation of the general health during the
prevalence of contagious or epidemic diseases. From their minute division
and yast range of action, latent poisonous exhalations or effluyia, inappreciable
by the balance, may, no doubt, exist to dangerous extent without being evi-
dent to the sense of smell. But in most cases it will be found, that, when
contagious diseases prevail to such extent, the emanations from the sick will,
if attended to, give the surest indications of the contamination of the sur-
rounding air.
