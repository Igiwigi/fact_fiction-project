With a prism of 70° 31’ formed by two octahedron faces, and with 1°4598 for the
index of the crystal, and 1°3425 for the index of the liquid, the angle of emergence
should be 0 = 3° 57’ 36”.

Of course one difficulty introduced by the use of the alum crystal itself is that the
angle is not exactly that of the regular octahedron, and is liable to small variations.
The faces, A, B, of the crystal used in this experiment did not give multiple images,
and were inclined to one another at the angle 70° 24’. For this prism the angle of
emergence should be # = 3° 50! 0”.

The preliminary experiment gave a smaller angle of emergence, indicating a higher
refractive index for the liquid, and showing that the solution in contact with the
growing crystal is, in fact, supersaturated.

Before proceeding to determine the exact refractive index of the liquid, it was now
necessary to ascertain (1) how the refractive index of strong solutions varies with
their concentration ; (2) whether there is any sudden change in the index in passing

from the saturated to a supersaturated solution ; and (3) how the refractive index of
supersaturated solutions varies with their strength. So far as I am aware, no
previous observations have been made upon the refractive indices of supersaturated,
or even of saturated, solutions of the substances investigated in this paper.
