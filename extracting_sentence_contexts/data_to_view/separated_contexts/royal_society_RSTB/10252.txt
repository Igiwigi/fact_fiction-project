This led to papers reflecting on from a common ancestor with a tympanic ear it would be
how a functional tympanic reptilian middle ear could have assumed that the external ear canal and tympanic membrane
been transformed into the mammalian middle ear [12,13]. It is would form in the same way in the different groups. In fact,
now widely accepted that the stem amniote did not have a tym- the external ear canal forms at different positions within the
panic middle ear and therefore tympanic middle ears evolved head in birds (chick) and mammals (mouse), with the
