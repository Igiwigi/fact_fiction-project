Here Kp is an initial value of the total kinetic energy of the unit cell. Given the known kinetic
energy, the potential energy per unit cell can be calculated as I = Ky â€” K. At large times, the
integral in the right side of formula (6.4) tends to zero. Kinetic energy tends to half of its initial
value. Therefore, at large times, mathematical expectations of kinetic and potential energies are
equal. This fact is in a good agreement with the results presented in paper [48].

Oscillations of the kinetic energies, described by formulae (6.3), (6.4), decay in time. At large
times, the system tends to thermal equilibrium, i.e. to a state with spatially and temporary
uniform distribution of kinetic temperature [37]. Kinetic and potential energies tend to some
equilibrium values and K tends to Keg. Equilibrium kinetic energies can be calculated using the
non-equipartition theorem, derived in paper [37]:
