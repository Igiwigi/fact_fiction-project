Now, as has already been stated,
the particular F; family of Oc. biennis x rubricalyx which was used in making these
crosses contained 12 R plants: 1 7. This approximates to the 15 : 1 ratio for two
duplicate factors and suggests that the plant of this F; family was heterozygous for two
factors for red. This is borne out by the fact that in earlier experiments with
rubricalyx (GATES, 1915b), different families gave 15 : 1, 3.: 1, and also in some cases
unexplained 5: 1 ratios. The evidence indicates that a two-factor hypothesis rather
than a differential rate of pollen tube growth is necessary to explain the results.
