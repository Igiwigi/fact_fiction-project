times that dose. The activity of the anaphylatoxin on the plain muscle may be twice
or thrice that of the normal serum ; certainly it is not more. While the action of this preparation on plain muscle is under discussion, we may
recall the fact that FrrepBerGer (32) himself has tested it in this way. He found
that it stopped the activity of an isolated slip of intestinal muscle, and argued, some-
what surprisingly, that this represents the true anaphylactic reaction, while the
contraction of the isolated anaphylactic uterus in response to its antigen has not this
significance, because the muscle is stimulated and not killed. We have failed to
confirm FRrEDBERGERâ€™S observation.
