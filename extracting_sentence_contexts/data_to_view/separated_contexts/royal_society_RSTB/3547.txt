Rerzrus (1892, p. 15), after investigating the giant fibres of Lumbricus,* agreed
with von Lennoss√©K that these elements could scarcely be considered to be nerve
fibres because : (1) they resist staining by Goxar's method ; (2) they never branch ;
and (3) they do not arise from cells. The particular staining reaction upon which such great dependence for specific
staining and diagnosis of nerve elements was placed is admittedly very capricious ;
there are many undoubted nervous structures in almost any Golgi preparation
which have not been blackened by this process, and therefore it cannot be relied upon
as a test for nerve elements. As a matter of fact, ApATHy and others have since
shown that these very structures investigated by von Lennossik and Rerazius,
namely, the giant fibres of Zumbricus, contain typical neurofibrillee and are certainly
nervous in spite of their non-impregnation by the method of Gouer. The giant fibres

have confined their attention to the examination of these structures in Oligochwtes,

of Halla also resist staining by this method (see p. 475), but are nevertheless true
nerve fibres (see pp. 483-488). The second objection of Rerzrus to the nervous nature of the giant fibres, namely,
that they do not give off branches, is astonishing when one considers that branches of
the giant fibres of the earthworm had been previously described by Vienat (1883),
Hauer (1889), and FrrepiAnper (1888, 1891), and branches of the giant fibres of
certain Polychzetes by Ronn (1887).
