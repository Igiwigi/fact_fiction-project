ZH11 and the wild-type NIPB served as resistant and susceptible controls, respectively. (b) Gene expression of Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 was detected using qRT-PCR in the
transgenic lines and wild-type NIBP. (cg) Lesion area of infected leaves was measured at 7 dpi with the Image) software. (d,f) The relative fungal growth was
Measured at 7 dpi using the calculation MoPot2/OsUbq. (e) Resistance phenotype of the transgenic lines gene expression of Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 was detected using
qRT-PCR in pizh-1 single and pizh-1/pizh-2 double mutants in the ZH11 background. One-month-old seedlings were punch-inoculated with isolates 85-14, indi-
cating that pizh-1 partially but pizh-1/pizh-2 completely lost blast resistance, compared with the wild-type ZH11. A Student's t-test was used to analyse the
significance of the difference (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, n.s.: not significant) (c,d,g,f).

(e) Pizh-1 interacts physically with Pizh-2 to form performed a split luciferase complementation assay to
determine the Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 interaction in planta

hetero-complex (figure 5b). Therefore, Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 form a functional
