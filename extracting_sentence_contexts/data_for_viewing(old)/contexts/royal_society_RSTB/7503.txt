in complete agreement with those found with Feulgen staining. From investigations of
various aspects of Feulgen’s reaction (Stedman & Stedman 1948, 19506; Ely & Ross
1949; Ris & Mirsky 1950), it is now certain that the technique used by Pollister &
Leuchtenberger cannot possibly yield correct values for the nucleic acid content of cell
nuclei, and it is therefore clear from Di Stefano’s result that measurements made with
ultra-violet light are also subject to large error.

EXTRACTION OF BASIC PROTEINS FROM CELL NUCLEI

It has been known since the original work of Miescher (1897) on salmon sperm heads
and the extension of his methods to the nuclei of avian erythrocytes by Kossel (1884)
that basic proteins can be extracted from certain isolated cell nuclei or from nuclear
material by means of dilute mineral acids. This method has, in fact, usually been employed
for the preparation of protamins and histones from fish sperm heads and of histones from
nucleated erythrocytes. Nevertheless, the histone from the thymus gland of the calf,
which is the only member of this group of basic proteins which has hitherto been sub-
mitted to any extensive chemical investigation, has always been prepared by other
methods (Lilienfeld 1894; Felix & Rauch 1931) from the whole gland. The basic proteins
used in the present investigation have, with the exception of that from wheat germ, been
extracted from isolated cell nuclei. This procedure not only ensures that they do, in fact,
originate from the nucleus, but it also constitutes an important step in their purification.

Histones

For the extraction of histones, 2g. of dry cell nuclei are weighed into each 50 ml.
