merely compared with others of the series whose errors were determined by the original
process (as, being intended for use through a limited range of temperature, they did not
admit of independent determination of the boiling-point).

The following thermometers, still remaining, were completely corrected by the original
process:—A, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9; Long $, 1, 2, 3, 6. The following were corrected by com-
parison :—B, 4, 5, 6, 7,8, 9,10; C, 1,2, 4, 66, 7,8, 9, 10; Flat S, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 (all by
comparison with A, 8, 9); Flat S, 6, 8; Flat Bore, 1, 2; Bent, 1, s; also BaiLy's A (by
comparison with others of the A series); Flat S, 9, 10, 11, 12 (by several of the A series
and several of the Long $S series); Bent, 0 Notch, 2 Notches (by comparison with the
whole of the A series and the whole of the Long S series). 'The thermometers described
as Bent 0 Notch and Bent 2 Notches are otherwise marked R and L, and are the ther-
mometers which were inserted in the quicksilver trough, and on which in fact almost
the whole of Mr. SHEEPSHANKs's operations in the comparison of his own standards
depend, 80 far as they are influenced by temperature. In some few instances, how-
ever, the temperatures depend on 7 and s (bent thermometers with small bulbs which
were inserted in holes in the bars). The freezing-points and the inequality of gradua-
tions of L, R, 7, s were determined independently, but not the boiling-points.

I am inclined to think that the papers containing some of the early comparisons of
thermometers have never reached me. Thus it would appear that for Mr. SyERP-
SHANKS's © Statement,” dated 1848, July 18, some comparisons of the Ordnance Bar
Thermometers and of BaiLy's Thermometer A must have been made; but I find none,
in the papers which I possess, anterior to 1855. Even for the important thermometers
Land R, I find no comparisons anterior to 1850. In one of Mr. SHEEPSHANKS'S papers
