in a given habitat over the course of their lives [4]. Through the use of plants’
signals (floral ‘display traits’, which include specific colours, scents and mor-
phologies), along with past experiences of floral resource quality and quantity,
flower foragers learn to focus on relatively more profitable flowers, patches and
plant species. Some groups of flower foragers even share this information with
conspecifics to manage real-time colony foraging strategies [5].
However, many animal-pollinated plant species produce flowers that contain
no rewards at all. Over 7500 rewardless plant species have been described to date,

many rewardless species are regularly visited, and pollinated, by flower foragers.
Some rewardless plant species produce sexually deceptive or brood-site mimick-
ing flowers: they rely on signals associated with animal reproduction to lure
