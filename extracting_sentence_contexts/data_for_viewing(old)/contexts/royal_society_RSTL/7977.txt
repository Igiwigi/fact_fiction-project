lengths of fore and after body suited to enable a ship to be driven economically at a

given speed.

It is well known that in water that is shallow, compared with the length of a wave,
waves of a given period are retarded according to a certain law (se A1Ry on Tides and
Waves). Hence the fact, which has often been observed, that a length which is sufficient.
for a given speed in deep water, becomes insufficient in shallow water—the waves of the
first class becoming divergent, and the swell under the after body lagging behind, 80 as

For waves of the second class, the value of W is given by equation (72), putting for |
Z the value given by equation (68)—that is, the mean depth of immersion DS. Hence |

and this is probably unaltered in shallow water. The period of these waves is the same
with that of the dipping, or vertical oscillation of the ship, whose value in deep water
