that the cell has an internal regulatory phenomenon, endomixis, which is self-
suflicient for the life of the race. From other observations made on mass-cultures,
they consider that endomixis and conjugation may occur simultaneously among
different individuals of the same culture, thus strongly suggesting that the same
general conditions lead to both phenomena and that both fill essentially the same
place in the economy of the creature. It is. evident, they continue, that in the life-
history of Paramacium, periodically, a dynamic reorganisation occurs, either by
endomixis or by syngamy. Lastly, while endomixis is not regarded as exactly
comparable with parthenogenesis, for instance, both are nevertheless apokaryomictic
phenomena, which must be contrasted with karyomictie ones such as conjugation.

If, therefore, endomixis is still necessary for the continued existence of a race of
Parameciuin, which is (artificially) prevented from conjugating, does not this fact still
further diminish the value of any generalisation that syngamy is not an essential
process! For, according to the opinion of the authors themselves, endomixis is
only a variant of conjugation, both processes having a similar function ; and emphasis
is laid upon molecular rearrangement as the result common to both.

I am strongly of opinion that it is in this direction that we must look to find the
primary cause of, or reason for, syngamy. In the protozoan cell-individual, the cell
possesses that characteristic complexity of structure, namely, differentiation into

* With regard to the “double” forms referred to in our account of this non-conjugating strain, I have
now come to the conclusion that they are instances of very long delayed division, and not of union at all.
About six months ago, moreover, I started another, entirely fresh non-conjugating strain, which I have
