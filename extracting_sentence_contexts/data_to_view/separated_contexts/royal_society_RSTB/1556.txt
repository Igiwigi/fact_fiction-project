The radial fibres of the tripus are strongly developed, but
QB otherwise ave normal. S Apart from the outer stratum of the anterior wall of the bladder, which is dorsally
6 wttached to the complex centrum, to the radial nodules and to the dorsal lamina, as
2 well as to the transverse processes of the fourth vertebra, we could detect no equivalent:
% to the transverse membrane of other Siluroids. It is possible, however, that the outer
@ stratum includes, not only « portion of the tunica externa of the anterior wall, but
‘2 the troneyerse membrane as well; at all events, such an explanation is suggested
E by the fact. that the outer stratum has the characteristic attachment of the transverse
3 membrane to the dorsal laminte, which is, apparently, never the case with any
= portion of the proper tunica externa in other Siluroids. “All the normal Pimelodina:
2 that we have examined resemble Platystoma in this respect.
