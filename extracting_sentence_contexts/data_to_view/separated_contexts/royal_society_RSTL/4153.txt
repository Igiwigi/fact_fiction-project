The cerotic acid how-
ever was entirely absent. When extracted in the boiling alcohol a portion of the
wax dissolves ; but on the addition of acetate of lead to the alcoholic solution hardly
a trace of precipitate is formed. Such a variation in the nature of an insect-secretion under different conditions of
life is a remarkable fact, which we may place by the side of the curious difference in
the nature of the constituents of butter in different years, discovered by Lercn. In his excellent investigation on the nature of the volatile acids of butter, this chemist
discovered* that the butyric and caproic acids of one year were in another year
replaced by vaccinic acid, an acid from which, by deoxidation, the two former acids
might readily be formed. Vaccinic acid.
