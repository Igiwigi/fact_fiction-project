A comparison between the fitted Ag and AEgp initio aS a : =
function of r is shown in figure 4a. 2

Owing to the difficulty of calculating ab initio values for the potential energy curve of CH3 [3
dissociation from anything larger than structure D in figure 2, the EVB potential for CH3 [a
dissociation was constructed as follows: The functional form and parameter values required to :8
specify Hj2 were obtained from fits to ab initio energies along the neopentane dissociation curve Ss
(shown in figure 4a); the offset parameters ¢1 and ¢2 were specified so that Vj + ¢1 is equal to zero 18

and V2 + €2 equals the -CH3 dissociation energy of structure D (see figure 2) at large r. A relaxed
scan along the C-C reaction coordinate for the final parametrized diamond EVB model is shown
in figure 4b. The fact that the neopentane fits in figure 4a can produce reasonable dissociation
curves at the diamond surface (figure 4b) indicates that the fitted EVB parameters have some
degree of transferability.

4. Molecular dynamics simulations of —CH3 dissociation at the diamond surface

(a) NVE simulations

Having obtained an accurate and efficient -CH3 dissociation potential at the diamond surface,
we investigated the relative rates of processes (R2a) and (R2b) using non-equilibrium NVE MD
simulations. Here, ‘non-equilibrium’ refers to the fact that the initial conditions of each NVE
trajectory were modified from coordinates and velocities selected from an NVT ensemble (details
below), in order to emulate the nascent vibrationally excited SCH3* species that we expect would
be formed upon hydrogen atom addition to SCH)p. (In the canonical (NVT) ensemble, amount of
substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved.) MD trajectories were propagated
in order to observe the fraction of trajectories in which prompt methyl formation was observed
prior to the establishment of thermal equilibrium.
