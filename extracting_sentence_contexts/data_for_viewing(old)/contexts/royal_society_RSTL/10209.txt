may either expend itself entirely or produce only such 8mall effects as, in the experi-
ment last related, presented themselves in excitations 3 to 7.

In our previous paper the phenomena described above were referred to as evidences
of summation. It will be better in future to limit the application of this word to the
Still more remarkable phenomenon which has been dexcribed under the heading
*Summation” in Part V., p. 47; for those phenomena are strictly analogous to the
effects to which the term *Summation of stimuli” has been applied by STirLNG.*
The term © Summation ” is in itself as applicable to the process now under considera-
tion as to the other, but it differs from it in this respect—thab it is rather a summation
of effects than a summation of excitations. The process with which it is most com-
parable in the physiology of animal excitable tissues is that which is known as the
Treppe or staircase.+ By this term is designated the fact that when the ventricle of
the heart of the frog is subjected, after a period of rest, to a. series of effectual
excitations, the contractions become stronger and stronger, although the excitations
are all of equal intensity. In both processes the mechanical effect of the first excita-
tion is much smaller than that of the second, the second smaller than that of the
third, and 80 on, but in the Treppe the difference which is large ab firsb rapidly
diminishes, whereas in the leaf it as rapidly increases. Further, the total mechanical
effect of the first excitation is 80 8mall as to be barely perceptible, whereas in the heart
the firs contraction (7.e., the weakest) is at least half as vigorous as the strongest.
But in proceeding with our comparison we find that in both, the change of form is
opposed by a resistance which has its seat in the structure of the organ, and is removed
8tep by step when it is suhjected to repeated excitations. In the heart this resistance
diminishes rapidly at first, more slowly afterwards : in the lamina of the leaf it does
