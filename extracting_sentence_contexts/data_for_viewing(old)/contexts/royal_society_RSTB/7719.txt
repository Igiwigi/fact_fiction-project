“...arich aerial fauna, consisting of weak-flying insects of small size and high buoyancy... .
These forms, being carried involuntarily by the wind, are dispersed by air movements as
contrasted with the migration of moths, butterflies and locusts, which are sufficiently
powerful to maintain their flight if necessary against the wind’ (Freeman 1945, p. 150).

What seems to be under-emphasized here is that long-range movement, no matter to what
degree controlled en route, rarely occurs unless the insects’ behaviour contributes in some
positive way to it, and that it is the making of this contribution, not the mechanism of their
horizontal displacement, which distinguishes the insects biologically as migrants. Displacement
may be active or passive, but ‘passive migration’ is a contradiction in terms.

There is, in fact, wide variation in the degree to which migrants traverse the ground
through their own exertions, or on the wind. The variation is continuous and its causes need
to be studied; whereas it tends to be left on one side when migration is regarded either as
essentially active, or as essentially passive. The antithesis between ‘active’ and ‘passive’
migration is misleading, for it gives primary importance to a biologically secondary matter:
the particular means of traversing the ground, employed by migrants.

In any given case the antithesis is even more misleading, for activity and passivity are not
alternatives. The study of locust migration has suggested that the wind is an essential
element in the creation of any geographical trend among numbers of swarms. As long as
we are considering such trends, and not the momentary behaviour of a single locust or
a single swarm, there is no point at which we can say the insects are now active, or now
passive. They are always both active and passive. Swarms can suffer the passive displace-
