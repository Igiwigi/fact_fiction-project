These results are somewhat greater than those deduced from experiments
with the same cylinders in the 17th set ; but here I should repeat the remark
already alluded to in page 444. In fact, on referring to the observation book,
I find that the interyals of the coincidences were only 14 seconds : and I fear
that a sufficient number of them were not taken, to insure that degree of accu-
racy which is requisite in such minute inquiries. I should therefore give the
preference to the preceding set of experiments.

The next and last class of experiments was necessarily very limited ; as,
from the construction of my vacuum apparatus, I could not conveniently ex-
tend them 80 far as I could wish. They were instituted for the purpose of
determining the difference between the results of the brass cylinders, and the
thin brass discs 8wung edgeways, and the results when swung in the manner
already described ; namely, with their flat sides opposed to the line of motion.
The two cylinders, used in the preceding set, and the two discs respectively
