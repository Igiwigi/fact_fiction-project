cells is similar,

Endosperms other than those of Palms â€”As IT have remarked elsewhere, the
endosperm of Palm seeds is particularly favourable material for an investigation of
the perforation of the cell wall by protoplasmic filaments. And, speaking generally,
in the examination of most endosperms other than those of the Palme, additional
difficulties are presented which greatly interfere with successful observation.
Especially does it become apparent that the thickness of the pit membrane is not

nearly 80 great, and this fact both increases the difficulties of making ont the threads,
and in consequence of the rapid blue coloration of 8uch a thin membrane causes the
observations with iodine and Chlor. Zinc Tod. frequently to be almost valueless and
often an impossibility. It is in 8vch cases that my staining method comes to be 80
important.

Often it would seem that the threads are 80 excessively fine that they cannot be
resolyed as 8eparate filaments, and the appearance presented by the whole aggregate
of threads crossing the pit membrane is simply that of a blue coloration. Tn this
direction the results with Bomarea are of special interest, as they tend to give weight
to the view thab my experiments have led me to adopt, viz. : that a well defined blue
coloration, after the action of Chlor. Zine Tod. and picric-HorMaxx's-blue, points to
the presence of protoplasmic threads in the cell-wall.
