midrib extending almost to the tip of each segment. The lateral veins are given off
at a wide angle, and usually bifurcate close to their point of origin. Anastomoses
between adjacent lateral veins are fairly common (fig. 23, A., Plate 18), especially near
the midrib, where they give rise to areole not unlike the characteristic meshes on
either side of the midrib in a pinnule of Woodwardia. The fairly regular radial
series of areol in the upper part of the portion of lamina represented in fig. 23, B, S,
marks the position of a sorus, the central plexus of vascular tissue being situated at
the base of the receptacle which bore the sporangia. The frequent anastomoses of the

veins seem to have been overlooked in previous descriptions; it is a fact of some
importance in the comparison of recent and fossil species. Hooker and Baver refer
to the recticulum below each sorus, but speak of the veins generally as free,* and a
figure illustrating the venation in a recent work} in which the species is dealt with,
represents the veins as free. In the two “nature prints” of Matonia pectinate in
ErrmcsHavsen’st ‘Farnkriiuter der Jetztwelt’ the veins are seen to be partially
anastomosed. The venation may be described as a combination of the Nervatio
Taniopteridis and N. Doodyw.§
