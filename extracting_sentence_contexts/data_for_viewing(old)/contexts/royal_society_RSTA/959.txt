form (2.7).

After this, we apply proposition 3.3 which says that the formula from proposition 3.1 holds
true exactly for the functions F and H. In other words, we can introduce two different ‘good’
coordinate systems (x,y,4,g) and (x,y, i,@) as in proposition 3.1 for (A, F, 9) and (A, F, 2),
respectively (note that 4 = 4 automatically as both 4 and 4 coincide with P).

The next step is to consider the map W : (x,y, 4,9) +> (X,¥, i,@) and after this continue working
with the forms 2 and W*(). Now (x,y,4,9) is a common ‘good’ coordinate system for both
systems and the conditions of theorem 5.4 are still fulfilled for @ and w*(@). After this, it remains Dos
to apply proposition 5.3 for the integrable systems (H, F, 2) and (A, F, ¥*(@)). =

The fact that (i) implies (ii) follows from the assumption that the symplectic forms 2 and 38
Q induce the same orientation and coorientation on yo. Indeed, this implies that preserves the :
homology classes of y and jz. on each ‘narrow’ torus. Therefore, if we set x = ©*x in the definition nee)
of the actions I(H, F) and I,(H, F), then I(H, F) = I(H, F) and I,(H, F) =1.(H, F). | 72

Note that due to analyticity it is sufficient to compare the actions only on the family of ‘narrow’ : a
tori, although I and I are defined on the whole neighbourhood U(yp). :S

Remark 5.5. In fact, we do not even need to mention H and F in the statement of theorem 5.4 [8
at all and can equivalently reformulate it as follows: .

Consider a singular fibration with a parabolic orbit yo which is Lagrangian with respect to two
symplectic structures 2 and $2. Suppose that 2 and & induce the same orientation and the same
