The ratios for the last three harmonics are in moderate agreement, especially in
view of the considerable seasonal variations in the amplitudes of the third and fourth
harmonics. If the ratios for the first harmonic had also been about 10, little doubt
could remain that all four are produced by a single ‘semi-diurnal atmospheric
oscillation, roughly of type Q.?, as in the case of the lunar diurnal magnetic
variations. Even as it is, the fact that the harmonic Q,~' will appear with Q,' in the solar, but
not in the lunar data, leaves a possibility of explaining the above figures without
introducing a further atmospheric oscillation into the theory. The agreement of
phase, and the apparently more fundamental character of the 12-hour oscillation as
compared with that of the 24-hour period (at the earth’s surface) favour this solution. It is worth while, however, to examine the magnetic effects of a 24-hour atmo-
spheric oscillation, Considering the amplitudes of the magnetic components, on the

movements of the same equatorial amplitudes, the following values are obtained
