plants had been grown either in free atr—in which case they had fixed, from some source,
Slightly larger amounts of Nitrogen than were contained in the seed,—or in fixed and
limited volumes of air (carbonic acid being' added), in which cases no gain of Nitrogen
was observed. The gain of Nitrogen in the free air was, moreover, considered to be too
small to indicate, under all the cireumstances, any assimilation of free or uncombined
Nitrogen. On the other hand, M. G. Viiuz's experiments up to the same period had
indicated an enormous gain of Nitrogen. The Nitrogen in the products, indeed, some-
times amounted to more than forty times that contained in the seed.

Rexults 80 strikingly contradictory could hardly fail to excite great attention and
interest among Chemists and Vegetable Physiologists. But M. VILLE's plants had been
grown in a constant current of renewed air, and not in only a fixed and limited volume
of it. This fact, and some other points, were alleged to account for the difference in
result. At any rate, on the one hand, M. Bovss1NGAULT commenced in 1854, to expe-

riment with a current of air; whilst, on the other, a Commission, composed of Members
of the Academy of Sciences of France, was appointed to superintend the conduct of a
new set of experiments by M. G. Vis. It has already been shown, that M. BoussSIN-
6avLr's new experiments in which a current of air was employed, did not indicate any
assimilation of free or uncombined Nitrogen, any more than did those in which the
plants had grown in limited volumes of air only.
