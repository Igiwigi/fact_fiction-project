vary organs, © consisting of four small slender blind tubes, each about two lines in lengthy
which are placed at equal distances around the commencement of the alimentary canal
in the Gnathostoma spinigerum, a mall Nematoid worm clozely allied to Strongylus)
which he discovered in the tunics of the stomach of a tiger. These tubes he seemed tt
think emptied their secretion into the mouth. Treg has described and figured two
small glandular bodies in connexion with the large pharyngeal cavity of Enoplus caruleds
Each of these is rather elongated in form and provided with a nucleus, and he thinks
may open into the pharynx anteriorly.

Glandular bodies are present in connexion with the termination of the intestine W
many Nematoids, both free and parasitic. These have been carefully described and
figured by EBERTH in many species, and though, curiously enough, he seems quite to have
made up his mind as to their nature when existing in the free Nematoids, by the fact of
his having given them the name of * anal glands,” still when he meets with similar
structures in the parasitic species he s8eems to dally with the idea that they may perchanfſ
belong to the nervous system, seemingly led away in this manner by the misconceptial
into which Warrer had fallen concerning the nervous system of Ozyuris ornate, Wl
animal in which anal glands appear to be present. These structures WALTER ﬆtil
persists in believing should be considered as central ganglia of a nervous system.

I have met with these anal glands amongst the free Nematoids in the genera Anticomar
Linhomaeus, and Cyatholaimus. They consist of from two to four finely granular mas
varying in shape and size, each having a clear central nucleus-like body, which may
when small, as in the genus Anticoma, be in close connexion with the rectal portion
the intestine, or if larger may occupy much of the cavity of the body between this and
