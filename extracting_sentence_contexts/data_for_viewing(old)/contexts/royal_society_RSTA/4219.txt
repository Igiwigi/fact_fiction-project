the final experience. If, as Fuchs and Schack hold, the agents’ experience is part of the story from
the very beginning, some form of reduction of the wave function seems to take place by virtue of
changing expectations.

(c) Contextualism of what?

Both QBists and Copenhagenists are contextualists but it seems that they hold different opinions
about what has to be included in the context. Contextualism contains at least a semantic and an
epistemic dimension that in Bohr’s case go together. If it does not make sense to associate a certain
concept with a certain observation, it is also impossible to claim that you have beliefs of what you
see in terms of this concept. Let us call this ‘semantic contextualism’. In contrast, it is possible
to urge that in certain contexts one is deprived of having a particular knowledge in spite of the
fact that our concepts for having such knowledge are well defined in those contexts. In quantum
mechanics, that would be a case in which we cannot simultaneously measure non-commuting
observables because of hidden variables.

Bohr was the first to point out that the experimental context plays an important role in using
classical concepts to describe a quantum object. Classical terms, Bohr argued, have no meaning
in quantum mechanics outside the experimental context. The apparatus constitutes the necessary
conditions for attributing a classical property, and, together with an actual outcome, they form
the necessary and sufficient conditions of attributing such a property.

The essential lesson of the analysis of measurements in quantum theory is thus the
emphasis on the necessity, in the account of the phenomena, of taking the whole
experimental arrangement into consideration, in complete conformity with the fact that
