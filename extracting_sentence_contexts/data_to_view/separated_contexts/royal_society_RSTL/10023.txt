Such experiments afford, however,
even a less 8afe ground for conclusions as to the adult Mammalian heart than do the
experiments upon Frogs' hearts above referred to. The heart of three-day Chick
embryos is but a protoplasmic mass, little differentiated, presenting neither definite
musenlar or nervous tissue, and without any developed controlling extrinsic nerves. From the fact that such a mass of hardly-differentiated embryonic cells contracts more
