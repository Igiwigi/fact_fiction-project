At the apex the
fibres from the anterior portions of the opening and septum go to form the posterior
half of the apicial orifice (Plate XII. figs. 2 & 11, ), where they become continuous
with the anterior fibres of the sixth layer (Plate XI. fig. 6, nn"); while those from the
posterior portions of the opening and septum enter into the formation of the anterior
half of the apicial orifice (Plate XII, fig. 11, 7), and become continuous with the posterior
fibres of the sixth layer (Plate XII. fig. 6, 00'). I use the term apicial orifice, because
the apex is opened into when the two sets of fibres which constitute the first layer

#* The apex in the ventricle of eyen the horse does not exceed the eighth of an inch in thickness. This
deficiency in the thickness of the ventricular wall, which, during the dilatation of the organ and the first stage
of contraction, ensures great freedom of motion, is prevented from operating injuriously during the latter stages
of contraction, by such portions of the musculi papillares as are situated at the apex plaiting into each other 80
as entirely to obliterate the apicial cavity.

+ It is a great mistake to imagine that all the fibres of the ventricles arise from the auriculo-yentricular
tendinous rings, the fact being that, with the exception of the fibres of the first and 8eventh layers, they are con-
tinuous beneath them. These rings are more fully deyeloped anteriorly than posteriorly, and the ring which
belongs to the left ventricle is stronger than that which belongs to the right. IN THE VENTRICLES OF THE VERTEBRATE HEART. . 457
