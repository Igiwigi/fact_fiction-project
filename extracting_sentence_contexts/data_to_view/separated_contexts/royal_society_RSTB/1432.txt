chemical bodies theve is a disseverance of a more complex molecule into its compon
and simpler molecules. The question resolves itself into the nature of the affiniti

any complex chemical body to look rather for a combination of the ascertained actions
of its component parts, than endeavour to pourtray any action peculiar to the whol
With this object it will be well now to reiterate succinctly the physiological actions
attributable to aldoxime, and while so doing to judge how far they reflect the com-
