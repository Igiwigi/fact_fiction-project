he rest lie less or more
below it. Conclusion. The principal result of these first experiments on gases is the broad fact of the
departure of the specific heat at constant volume from constancy. Some such result
might have been, perhaps, anticipated from the known imperfectness of all gases. But
the invariability of the two specific heats is in text books most generally insisted on.
