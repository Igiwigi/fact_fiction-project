The Magnetic Experiments.—-An attempt was at first made to carry out the
magnetic measurements at South Kensington, the earth’s field being also measured
by means of the magnetometer which supported the coils, which magnetometer had
been frequently compared with the Kew standard instrument. It was, however,
found that the magnetic disturbance produced by an electric railway was so great as
to prevent observation except at such time as the trains do not run, namely,
between 1.30 a.m. and 4.15 A.M. Observations were made during four nights, but
owing to the short time available, during which measurements of H had to be made
both with the coil and with the magnetometer, and also probably to the fact that
observing in the middle of the night after a day’s work does not conduce to the
accuracy with which the magnetometer settings can be made (always a trying
process), the results were not so concordant as had been expected.

In this difficulty the Director of the National Physical Laboratory was good
enough to put one of the magnetic huts at Kew at the author’s disposal for a week,
and so the magnetic observations were made there. This arrangement was a distinct
advantage, since it obviated the necessity of comparing the value of H at South
Kensington and at Kew. No silver depositions were made at Kew, but several
were made immediately before and after the Kew observations. Six of the cadmium
cells were taken to Kew and were used in turn. These cells were compared with
the remaining cells which were left at South Kensington before, during, and after
