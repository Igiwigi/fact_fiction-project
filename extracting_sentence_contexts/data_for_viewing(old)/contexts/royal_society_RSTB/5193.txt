Chesterfield, Derbyshire. The appearance of the coal is so remarkable that in February,
1927, the writer and his assistant, Mr. W. J. Epwarps, were independently able on
different occasions to find it at the Grassmoor Colliery, and with the assistance of the
Colliery Company to trace it to the Deep Soft (Heathcote) seam, though it has not yet
been examined in situ.

General Macroscopic Appearance in Horizontal and Vertical Sections.

6. The band is a bright one, but in natural fractures, either “* face ” or “ end,” it has
a striated appearance which gives it a silky lustre resembling that of “ watered ” or
“ moiree ” silk. It must, therefore, be described as clarain and not as vitrain, according
to the macroscopic features laid down by Dr. Sropes.(1) It differs from the commoner
attrital clarain, consisting of débris of heterogeneous botanical origin, in the fact that
the strie are not entirely parallel to the bedding plane, and that the appearance varies
according to the direction of the vertical section. Above and below the cortex band
are bands of durain consisting of general plant débris (Tutessen’s attritus) containing
megaspores.

These features are well seen when the coal is polished upon cloth, so as to produce
a certain amount of relief, and traces of cell-structure become visible under the micro-
scope. The cell structure, however, is only developed fully by etching for about one
minute.

The general macroscopic structure at low magnification (6 dias.) is shown in fig. 2
(No. 364), which is a photograph of a model of a cube of the coal, cut in three planes at
