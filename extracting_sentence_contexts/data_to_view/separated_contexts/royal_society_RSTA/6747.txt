Radiative heat transfer between two parallel plane surfaces has been considered by

Saunders (1929), Fishenden & Saunders (1932) and others, for general values of the emis-
sivities of the two surfaces. If 7,, 7,, are the emissivities of the surfaces of the ingot and mould
respectively, and a is Stefan’s constant, the net radiative heat flux from ingot to mould is

Din Ni a(04—64,,). (15-1)

If the two emissivities are the same and equal to 7 this becomes
[n/(2—9)] «(O;—Oh 41), (15-2)

but even if the emissivities of the two surfaces are not equal, (15-2) and (15-1) are equi-

valent if

that is, 7 is the harmonic mean of the emissivities of the two surfaces. With this understanding,
(15-2) can be used for the net radiative heat flux, without implying that the surfaces have the
same emissivity.
