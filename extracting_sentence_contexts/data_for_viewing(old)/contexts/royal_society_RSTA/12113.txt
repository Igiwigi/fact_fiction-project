THICKNESS AND ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF THIN LIQUID FILMS. 529

x
soap film is entirely new. We hope that the observations which we have made on it

will be of interest.
‘It is difficult to assign a reason why the addition of salt to the liquid should
uce so great a change in the results. In part, the better conducting salt
probably masks effects which when soap alone is used become predominant, but we
think it likely that in part at all events it actually prevents the changes to which
the change of conductivity is due.

However this may be, we venture to think that there can be no doubt as to the facts
that whereas the conductivity of a thin unsalted soap film is considerably greater
fhan that of the liquid in bulk, the difference is so reduced in the case of a salted

im with or without the addition of glycerine that the mean thickness of a number
@ black films whether measured electrically or optically is the same to within the
Rnits of the error of experiment.
