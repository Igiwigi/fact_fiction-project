MR. 5. 8S. HOUGH ON THE ROTATION OF AN ELASTIC SPHEROID. 343

§$ 9. Conclusions.

The existence of the Eulerian nutation, and the fact that it would give rise to a
variation in latitude, was first predicted theoretically on the assumption that the
Earth could be regarded as a rigid body. Our present work, however, shows that
the hypothesis of perfect rigidity, though affording a sufficiently close approximation
to the circumstances presented by nature to specify the character of the oscillation,
is totally inadequate to lead to a correct determination of the period unless the

arth possesses a very much higher degree of rigidity than is met with in substances
Svhich have been subjected to experiment. The only knowledge we have of the
‘amount of the Earth’s rigidity arises from the very vague indications furnished by
Pidal Theory, and we must therefore have recourse to observation to determine the

feriod with accuracy. This has been effected by Dr. CHanpiER, who, as the result
