When air is said to be electrified, and it frequently assumes this state
near electrical machines, it consists, according to my view, of a mixture of electrified
and unelectrified particles, the latter being in very Jarge proportion to the former. When we gather electricity from air by a flame or by wires, it is either by the actual
discharge of these particles, or by effects dependent on their inductive action, a case
of either kind being produceable at pleasure. That the law of equality between the
two forces or forms of force in inductive action is as strictly preserved in these as
in other cases, is fully shown by the fact, formerly stated (1173. 1174.), that, however
strongly air in a vessel might be charged positively, there was an exactly equal
amount of negative force on the inner surface of the vessel itself, for no residual
portion of either the one or the other electricity could be obtained. 1444. I have nowhere said, nor does it follow, that the air is charged only where
the luminous brush appears.
