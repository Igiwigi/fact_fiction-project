While in Pitys the strands are usually
imbedded in the pith and separated from the wood, in Callixylon they are usually in
contact with the wood, though sometimes separated from it by a few small cells. Further, the secondary wood in Dr, ZALEssKyâ€™s plant is arranged in wedges corres-
ponding to the primary strands, which is not the case in Pitys, Callixylon is clearly
much nearer to Pitys than to any other known genus, though the narrower rays and
other differences may justify generic separation. Callixylon approaches Archwopitys in the fact that most of the primary xylem-
strands, like the cireum-medullary strands of the Kentucky plant, are in contact with
the wood. The wedge-like arrangement of the wood noticed in Callixylon also
appears to a certain extent in Archeopitys. On the other hand, there are no
