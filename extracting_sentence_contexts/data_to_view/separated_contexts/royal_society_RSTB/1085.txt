We would, in the first place, urge, what we have reason to do
with greater weight later, that not one of the foregoing methods, 2.e., graphic degene-
ration, embryological, &c., is capable of answering the question of conduction or its
localisation in an absolute manner. The great difficulty in considering conduction by
the cord is the disseverance of the action of the bulbo-spinal centres from that of the
nerve fibres which happen to pass through or by them, and this difficulty does not
appear to us to have met with the amount of attention that it would naturally seem
to deserve. In fact, to our mind the galvanometric method is the only means within
our reach at present by which a solution can be arrived at, and even that method
requires to be considerably further elaborated. Dividing conduction in the spinal cord into the two great classes of —

1. Conduction of impulses downwards ;
2, Conduction of impulses upwards ;

we are able to summarise the facts which appear to be thoroughly reliable as follows :—

(1.) Conduction of Impulses downwards.—In Man and the highest Apes direct
conduction downwards, i.e, from the cortical centres to the bulbo-spinal system,
appears to be provided for in the upper half of the spinal cord by both the anterior
column, close to the margin of the anterior fissure, and, speaking roughly, by a
triangular area in the posterior part of the lateral column, just external to the
posterior horn of grey matter. :

(2.) Conduction of Impulses upwards.—There is known to be an entrance from each
posterior root into the postero-external column of fibres, which run directly from the
ganglion of the posterior root as high as the medulla oblongata.
