dition is often preceded for a short time by abnormal Region E reflexions. Also it
may be noted that during magnetic activity the “no-echo” condition is often
interrupted (for example, during the day-time) by the sudden occurrence of abnormal
Region E reflexions, even though the frequency used is such as would normally be
penetrating to Region F at that time ofthe day. In this connexion it is quite possible
that the reappearance of abnormal reflexions may be associated with temporary

abatement of the magnetic activity, for the evidence as a whole appears to suggest
the general rule that slight magnetic activity is associated with abnormal reflexions,
while intense magnetic activity brings about the “ no-echo”’ condition. The fact
that the frequency to which abnormal Region E reflexion persists has its highest
value, as distinct from its most frequent occurrence, at midnight, is illustrated in
fig. 37 where are plotted the highest frequencies on which nocturnal abnormal Region
