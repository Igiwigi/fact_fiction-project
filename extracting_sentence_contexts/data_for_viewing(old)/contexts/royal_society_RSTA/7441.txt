‘o than theory A; it would seem to be much superior to theory B (i); and judging from the

‘= —- For the 4s—5p and 4s—6p transitions of K1 the results obtained by the Coulomb approxi-

¢ Emphasis must be laid on the fact that for the transitions discussed the values of o? are

8 reproduced by altering the values of n* derived from the term values by little over 1 part
in 100. There is little doubt, therefore, that, even for K1, the wave functions themselves are
5 remarkably accurate.§ In consequence the results given by the Coulomb approximation
© for transitions not subject to interference effects (such as 4s—4p, 5s—4p, 5s—5p, 6s—5p, etc.)
must certainly be reliable, no matter what the final conclusion regarding those for the other
transitions may be.

} The interference for the 4p—4d transition of K 1 is particularly severe, the representative point on the
(ni —n¥, nf)-plane lying within 0-00, of one of the zero lines.
