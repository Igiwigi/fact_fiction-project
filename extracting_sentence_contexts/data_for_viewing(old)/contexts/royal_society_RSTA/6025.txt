Computing the expectation values from the above description, we obtain
pua(wa + Awa) + (1 — p)ta@wa — Awp) > wa(wa)
and
pup(we — Awa) + (1 — p)up(we + Aws) > up(ws). (3.3)
Solving both inequalities for p, we find

ua(wa) — Ua(wa — Awp) up(wg + Awp) — up(wp)
ua(wa + Awa) — ua(wa — Awp) up(wp + Awp) — up(we — Awa)’

(3.4)


where we used the fact that u4 and ug are increasing functions to establish that the denominators
of the two fractions in equation (3.4) are positive. If either or both inequalities in equation (3.4)
does not hold, then one or both agents will refuse to enter into the transaction, and so the
transaction will not take place.

A necessary condition for equation (3.4) to hold is that the upper bound of p be greater than its
lower bound, or

ua(wa) — Ua(wa — Awp) up(wp + Awg) — up(ws)
ua(wa + Awa) — ua(wa — Awp)  up(wp + Awp) — up(we — Awa)

(3.5)
