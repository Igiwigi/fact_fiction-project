The larger extents reduce possible effects of the sides and top boundaries. We note that due to uncertainty in the exact heights of formation of the ALMA observations,
the comparison of the magnetic topology of the mid-to-high chromosphere and the oscillatory
behaviours in the ALMA datasets are performed qualitatively. In addition, due to the fact that the
magnetic configuration in the high chromosphere is largely affected by the inclined/horizontal
fields from neighbouring field concentrations /active regions, no quantitative separations in each
dataset between, e.g. network and internetwork regions, are provided. In the following, we present each dataset, along with their oscillatory and magnetic-topology
properties, in separate figures (i.e. in figures 1-10). Each figure consists six panels organized as,

each dataset, as noted in the figure’s caption.
