The ampulla is certainly compara-
tively large in Cetorhinus, and its internal structure may be rather more complicated than
in some other species, but its general morphology does not appear to differ fundamentally
from that in other species where, as van den Broek (1932) says, transverse folds of the mucous
membrane of the interior are generally found. It is probable that similar structures serve
similar functions, and scme sort of aggregation of the spermatozoa may well be found to
occur in the ampullae of the ductus deferens in some other elasmobranchs. It may be
suggested that as a consequence of the sperm being enclosed in spermatophores, there will
be less likelihood of loss of sperm by leakage into the water when it passes from the cloaca
to the groove of the clasper during copulation, if, in fact, the clasper groove is the route by
which it is transferred. Conservation may well be an important matter because so large
a quantity, amounting to several gallons, of spermatophores is transferred. Kidney

The upper part of the kidney is modified as Leydigâ€™s gland in the male, but in the female,
though urinary in function, it is much less developed than the lower part and a number of
its segments are atrophied in the adult.
