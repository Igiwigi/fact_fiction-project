resolution microscopy techniques, so far. The prolonged reactivation of Alexa Fluor 594 is
particularly helpful to re-use the same sample for multiple measurements and to perform imaging
on different set-ups. The prolonged blinking of a fluorophore can be further used for single
particle tracking experiments [46-48]. The reactivation with UV illumination is similar to that of
Alexa Fluor 647 in a redox buffer but using light instead of chemicals [14,49]. It might be possible
that lasers bleach the fluorochrome permanently and faster. However, this might not be the reason
in the case of an incoherent light source. A proper calibration for different fluorophores with both
lamps and lasers is suggested.

We were also able to perform STED and LFSM on the same biological sample with comparable
resolution, confirming the high-resolution setting of the setup. The prolongated blinking
with deep blue illumination (350-380nm) was the key to achieve a high signal density and
subsequently the high resolution. This comes from the fact that the final resolution of an image
depends not only on the precision of localization but also on the total number of independently
localized signals [29,35].

At this point, we wish to re-emphasize that the blinking phenomenon can be observed in
ProLong Diamond as the imaging medium. This simplifies the need to prepare special buffers
consisting of the classical redox cocktail required for dSTORM [14] and other related super-
resolution techniques [16]. As the composition of Prolong Diamond is not known, at this stage
of the study, it was difficult to narrow down the minimal requirements for blinking to occur.
However, these results hint at a conformational explanation (more likely in a viscous/liquid
medium) of the blinking events [50,51], in addition to cycles of H* binding and release, as
previously hypothesized [52,53].
