ZU and V, an axis drawn arbitrarily through P, and a plane of section passing through
the axis and capable of reyolution about it. Proceeding as in the former memoir, and
Sforming the equations for contact of various degrees, and finally rendering them inde-
Spendent of the azimuth, we obtain the conditions for contact for all positions of the
Secutting plane about the axis. Such contact is called circumaxal ; and in particular it,
1s called uniaxal, biaxal, &c. according as it subsists for one, two, &c. axes. If it holds
good for all axes through the point, it is called superficial contact.
SZ It would at first sight scem that there should be a similar theory as to the number of
ha: about which contact must subsist in order that it may subsist, about all axes, or be
S superficial. It is, indeed, found that if two-pointic contact be biaxal, or if three-pointic
Qbe triaxal, &e., the contact will be superficial. But this would prove too much, as it
would give four conditions instead of two for two-pointic, six conditions instead of three
for three-pointic, &e, superficial contact ; and, in fact, it turns out that there are always
in two-pointic contact one, in three-pointic two, &c. axes (viz. the tangents to the
branches of the curve of contact through the point) about which the contact is cireum-
axal per 86, 80 that the theory in one sense disappears. But as it at first had a semblance
of existence, it may still be worth while to have laid its ghost.
At the conclusion of Q 3 it is shown that the method of plane sections may, in the
