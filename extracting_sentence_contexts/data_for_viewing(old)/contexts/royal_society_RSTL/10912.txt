If the surfaces are not strictly parallel in the directions TU and VW, the pressure
would be greatest in the narrowest, parts, causing axial flow from those into the broader
Spaces. Hence, if the surfaces were considerably irregular, the lubricant would, by

escaping into broader spaces, allow the brass to approach and eventually to touch the
journal at the narrowest/ paces, and this would be particularly the case near the ends.

As a matter of fact, the general fit of two new surfaces can only be approximate ;
and how near the approximation is, is a matter of the time and skill spent on preparing,
or, as it is called, bedding them. Such bedding as brasses are subject to would not;
bring them to a condition in which the hills and hollows differed by less than a Totooth
part of an inch, 80 that two 8uch surfaces touching each other on the hills would have
spaces as great as a zJggbh of an inch between them. This seems a 8mall matter, but
not when compared with the mean width of the interval between the brass and the
journal which, as will be snbsequently shown, was less than 555th of an inch.

It may be assumed, therefore, that such inequalities generally exist in the gurfaces
of new brasses and journals. And as the surfaces according to their material and
manner of supporb yield to pressure the brass will close on the journal at its ends,
where, owing to the escape of oil, there is no pressure to keep them separate.
