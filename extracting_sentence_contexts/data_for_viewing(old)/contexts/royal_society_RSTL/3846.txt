a delicate homogeneous membrane, is invested by a close capillary net-work, and
contains in its interior either floating cytoblasts, or mature cells, corresponding to
those of the true glands.

My dissections of Birds have included all the orders, and, in most instances, several
families from each : I have never failed to find the thyroid gland, or to recognise its
peculiar structure : I accordingly presume that it is universally present in this class
of animals.

Of its relative position it is unnecessary to say much more than is included in the
notices of previous observers, and I will merely mention that its relation to the Jarynx
seems neither essential nor constant. A more uniform and more important relation
is included in the fact, that the gland always corresponds to a particular spot of the
vascular system ; namely, that it lies on the cervical yessels, and receives its supply
of blood just opposite to the point at which the vertebral and carotid arteries diverge
to their respective destinations.

II. Reptiles.

It is unaccountable that in this class of animals, where the thyroid gland is univer-
sally manifest, it should have been 80 generally overlooked. Where noticed, it has
been, with rare and partial exceptions, either mistaken for the thymus, or confounded
with it in a common description.
