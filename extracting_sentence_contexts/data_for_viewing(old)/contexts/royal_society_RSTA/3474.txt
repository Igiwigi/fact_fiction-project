These properties match the nineteenth-century eruption of n Car remarkably well. Many other
SNe IIn are not as extreme as SN2006gy, but LBV-like mass loss is nevertheless implied for many


of them. From the observed luminosity and CSM speed measured in spectra, one can deduce the
progenitor mass-loss rate that is needed to account for the observed CSM interaction luminosity.
To make CSM interaction luminosity compete with the normal photospheric luminosity of the
SN, very dense CSM is required. Figure 6 (from [51]) shows the required pre-SN mass-loss rates
derived for a number of interacting SNe, as compared to mass-loss rates of known types of stars
(from [1]). While some of the lower-luminosity SNe Hn could be explained by the dense and
slow winds of the most extreme RSGs and yellow hypergiants, many interacting SNe seem to
be consistent with CSM that has been created by LBV-like eruptive mass loss. This does not
necessarily mean that all LBVs are poised to explode as SNe within the next decade—in fact,
many LBVs have massive shells that are centuries or millennia old—but it does mean that LBVs
may offer a valuable window into the eruptive instability of SN In progenitors.

(b) Variable speed and density of circumstellar material

Rather than arguments based on the amount of CSM mass, LBVs have also been identified as
possible SN progenitors based on variability in the CSM speed or density structure. Trundle et al.
[52] noted that the two component absorption troughs in some SNe IIn resemble features seen in
line profiles of the LBV AG Carinae, where the two velocities are thought to arise from the star
crossing the bistability jump. The modulation of the radio light curves of some SNe IIb suggests
density variations consistent with what may arise from changes in wind properties during the S
Doradus cycles of LBVs [53]. This led Kotak & Vink [53] to make one of the early suggestions that
