throughout and covered with scum. The scum and turbidity were sensibly the 8ame

the same day the neutralized infusion of the same hay was perfectly brilliant and free
from 8cum. Three days subsequently, however (that is to say, on the 10th of November),
the neutralized tubes also became turbid and covered with scum.

'The salient fact here to be noted is, that in neither the neutral nor the acid chamber
did a single tube of the old Heathfield hay-infusion maintain its primitive clearness and
freedom from scum.

The old London hay behaved substantially as the old Heathfield hay, no single
tube escaping either in the neutralized or the unneutralized chamber.

The dried new London hay comes next. A week after its introduction every one of the
8ix tubes containing the acid infusion was turbid and coated with scum. In the neu-
tralized chamber, on the contrary, two only of the back tubes gave way, the third back
tube and the three front tubes remaining clear.

On the 3rd of November, moreover, a new chamber of six tubes was charged with
