The method of
analysis therefore does '\not promise much 'success ; and the
labour of synthesis is sufficient to deter any individual from
the undertaking. It is my intention now to exhibit one example of my position,
and to prove that platina and mercury act upon each other, in
svch' a manner as'to disguise the properties of both. I shall
therefore wave for the present all consideration of palladium,
which is in fact but a subordinate instance of the case before us: When a solution of green‚Äù sulphate of iron is poured into a
solution of /platina, - no /precipitate, nor any other sensible
change ensues. This I had already observed, and it has since
been confirmed by all who have written upon the subject.
