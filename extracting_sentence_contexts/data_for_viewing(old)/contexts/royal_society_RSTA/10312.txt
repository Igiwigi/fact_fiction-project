The values given in the above table were not in all cases found from the range of
temperatures 0° C. to 100° C. The experiments of Narrersky and those of Kurrrer
on iron, platinum, and silver, were only performed over a small range of temperature,
from about 5° C. to 25° C., while the numbers of Scuarer and Benron apply to
temperatures between — 186° C. and + 20° C. It must also be pointed out that
Koutrausce and Loomis, Pisatt and Tomuinson, give formule showing that the
alteration of rigidity with temperature does not follow a linear law; Kont~rausca
and Loomis, and Tomutnson, finding that the rate of decrease per degree rise of
temperature increases with the temperature, a view with which Pisai’s results, with
a few exceptions, agree. The values given by Kontrausce and Loomis are very
different from those obtained by other observers, a result no doubt due in part to the
fact that the wires they used had not been subjected to any annealing process. These
authors state that observations taken on different days could not be compared, and
from their tables it is seen that the period of torsional oscillation decreased from day
to day. This means an increase of rigidity with time, an effect to which IT have drawn
special attention in this paper, and which, in unannealed wires, is quite large.

A fault common to all the experiments which have hitherto been made by the
dynamical method, is that sufficient precautions were not taken to insure that during
the observations at high temperatures the wire was everywhere throughout its length
at the same temperature. The average temperature of the wire must generally have
been considerably below the temperature indicated by the thermometers. This was
found to be the case when experimenting with the first form of apparatus used in the
present research. Under these circumstances, the observed rate of alteration of
