Consistent with [27, theorem 6.2], problem 2.2 can be understood as the problem of minimizing
the spectral abscissa. It is worthy of mention that addressing this problem for large-scale systems
is not trivial since expanding (2.4) to study the dominant roots is prohibitive. This is further
exacerbated by the fact that characteristic equation (2.4) representing the PR-controlled MAS has
infinitely many roots due to the presence of the delay h. For these reasons, tuning the parameters
(,kp,kr) in order to attain certain dominant root behaviour and hence to prescribe y-stability
is challenging.” As a preparatory step to studying y-stability, one can introduce the change of
variable s — (s — y), which simply shifts to the left the real parts of characteristic roots by an
amount of y. This change of variable transforms (2.4) into

f(y,s) = det(sIn — yy — A — Be" 8") =0. (2.6)

Analysing the stability transitions of (2.6) along the imaginary axis s=jw is equivalent to
analysing y-stability transitions of (2.4) along the shifted imaginary axis s=jw —y.
