house sheep; with that exception, however, it has cropped up in nearly all my
cultures. I regard these two types as the most successful of the coprozoic
flagellates, those best adapted, i.e, to this particular environment. They both
appear soon, always multiply rapidly, and soon conjugate and form cysts in large
numbers. Monas is perhaps the next most important and regular member of this
fauna. At first, it multiplies steadily, maintaining a fairly small form, but sub-
sequently becomes larger and more sluggish. With this form, after a while, are
associated large, highly refringent cysts, which are characteristic and unmistakable.
Small individuals persist, however, in an active condition for a long time, until â€˜the
culture is in the last stages of drying-up. Spivomonas has appeared more often of late
than it did at first. Both of these forms, when present, begin to crop up after three
days. Spivomonas also remains active, in a particular phase, so long as the culture is
moist ; a remarkable fact is that, in spite of all my efforts, I have not yet been able to
find the cysts of this form (one reason for this will be given below). Perhaps the
earliest form to appear is a small heteromastigine type, which I have found after two
days; but it has occurred only seldom. Bodo (Prowazekia) caudatus has occurred
more often, but neither of these types ever dominates the culture, so to put it, in the

3 way that one or more of the other flagellates usually do. Cercomonas occurs
2 irregularly and is generally the last to make its appearance, five or six days usually
= elapsing before I have noticed it. Neither does this form become very conspicuous
= by its numbers, though, as a rule, it persists for some time in an active condition.
2 This form produces cysts much more readily in the nutrient medium than it does in
& simple dung-cultures.
