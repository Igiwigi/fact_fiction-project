below the centre of motion of the ribs; the fibres fixed into those ribs act in relation
to the ribs from below upwards and forwards to draw them downwards, and slightly
backwards. We have here this curious fact, that the superior fibres of the same
musele, the serratus magnus, are expiratory, while the inferior fibres are inspiratory. The action of this muscle can only be demonstrated on the living body, but we might
have inferred, & priori, on knowing the relative direction of the various fasciculi of
the serratus and of the ribs into which they are respectively inserted, which fibres are
expiratory and which inspiratory. The serratus is in full stretch when the animal stands, and then it acts from the
ribs on the base of the scapula: if all its fibres were expiratory, it is clear that when
the scapular action is called into play, as the expiratory action would be constant,
inspiration would be interfered with, If all were inspiratory, the expiratory action
would be clogged.
