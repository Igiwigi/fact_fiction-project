We have tried from time to time to obtain some measures of the electrical thick-
= of films formed of a solution containing 3 per cent. KNOs, at thicknesses inter-
ediate between that corresponding to the black and 200 p.p. Such observations
Gould be very valuable in helping us to decide whether there is.or is not a real
Saximum of specific conductivity at about 100 p.n., which is suggested by the fact
fiat (in spite of the discrepancies above noted) the ratio of the electrical to the
Gtical thickness is less for thick films and for black films than for those whose
thicknesses lie between 200 py.p., and 400 py. Unfortunately, though we have
Ethausted every device known to us, sometimes leaving the film to thin unaided,
Bmetimes passing weak and sometimes strong currents through it, we have never
Sicceeded in getting the white of the first order. This connecting link cannot, there-
re, be at present supplied, but the facts are sufficient to justify the proposition that
increase in specific conductivity observed in the case of an unsalted solution is
largely diminished by the addition of a salt.
