Two of them are five-cusped teeth of the
right shape for a third premolar, but neither of them fits Owrn’s figure, which agrees
better with a specimen that is more properly to be referred to Protodichobune,
(Forster Cooper, 1932). It shows a large internal and two moderately sized external
cusps and two intermediates and to this extent is like Hyracotherium. A closer exam-
ination shows, however, that the ridge from the posterior intermediate cusp runs to
the outside of the posterior external cusp instead of to a point between the two external
cusps ; this, together with the fact that the tooth is much too small even for the small
molar, makes it almost impossible to believe that it belongs to Hyracotherium at all. There are, however, two teeth in the collection which in size and pattern are very
possibly the third premolars of this species. Both are of the left side, and may have been
added to the set after OwEn’s time. (The catalogue number for all these specimens
“several detached upper and lower premolars purchased in 1853” is 36572.) Both
