From these observations the inference may be drawn, that between these two nutri-
tious fluids, in the Zoological series, there obtains a definite physiological balance ;
that one is capable of absorbing or merging into the other, according as the obseryer
ascends or descends the scale. The chylaqueous system ends above with the larva
of Insects, and the true-blood system traced downwards terminates at the Echino-
dermata.

With reference to the nature of the function executed by the floating cells of the
vital fluids, I may be permitted to mention here one fact, which, during the prosecu-
tion of my recent studies, has excited in my mind a constant and eager attention.
When the voluminous corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluid of the Annelida burst in
the field of the microscope, the semi-fluid contents of these bodies  ftbrillate, i. e.
coagulate as they flow out of the containing cells. This is a constant fact observed
with the utmost exactness a thousand times. It is an absolute proof, addressed
directly to the eye, that the contents of the cells, that which they themselves secrete,
is a self-coagulating principle, is higher in organic properties than that in which the
cells float, and which surrounds them externally, and out of which therefore their
parietes mus produce what their cavities circumscribe. Science does not demand
a more satisfactory proof that the floating cells have for one of their offices that of
generating fibrine; another of their functions is that unquestionably of manufacturing
pigment.
