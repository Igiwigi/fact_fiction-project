IV. ARGUMENTATIVE INFERENCE RESPECTING THE NATURE OF
Þ LIGHT.

The experiment of Gr1MALD1, on the crested fringes within
the shadow, together with several others of his observations,
equally important, has been left unnoticed by NEwToNn. Those
who are attached to the NEwToN1aNn theory of light, or to the
hypotheses of modern opticians, ſounded on views till less en-
larged, would do well to endeavour to imagine any thing like
an explanation of these experiments, derived from their own
doctrines; and, if they fail in the attempt, to refrain at least
from idle declamation against a system which is founded on the
accuracy of its application to all these facts, and to a thousand
others of a similar nature,

From the experiments and calculations which have been pre-

certain equal distances'in the direction of its motion, is possessed
of opposite qualities, capable of neutralising or destroying each
