wards into the body and increase in the number of branchial clefts and branchial segments
was probably due to respiratory needs.

It may be imagined, therefore, that the mesoblast of the head was primarily
separated into four or five segments—four, if only the mandibular, hyoid, Ist branchial
and 2nd branchial be counted; five, if the premandibular section be given
segmental value. ‘To each segment passed a segmental nerve, 7.c., the V, VIT, IX,
X, or these and the IiIrd. There were, correspondingly, three intersegmental gill-
clefts.

Batrour showed that the mesoblast of the head of Selachian embryos becomes
split into somatic and splanchnic layers, and then, by the development of gill-clefts,
into a series of muscle-plates in the arches. He stated that “the fact that the
walls become developed into the muscular system of the head renders it almost
certain that we must regard them as equivalent to the muscle-plates of the body,
which originally contain, equally with those of the head, sections of the body cavity.”
He also recognised the existence of postotic somites, stating that “not far behind
the auditory involution there are visible at the end of period K a few longitudinal
muscles, forming about three or four muscle-plates, the ventral part of which is
wanting. I have not the means of deciding whether they properly belong to the
head, or may not really be a part of the trunk system of muscles which has to a
certain extent overlapped the back part of the head, but am inclined to accept the
latter view.”

These quotations, the second of which was not given by Goopricu, show that
