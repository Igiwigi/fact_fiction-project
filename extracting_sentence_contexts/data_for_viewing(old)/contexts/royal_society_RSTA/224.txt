as a model of data generated from a real qualitative trajectory, although, as
pointed out above, in the real qualitative dynamics each edge can be traversed in
only one direction. Under this model, it was estimated that O(2" N log N) such
qualitative states, or O(2* N? log N) observed edge directions, are needed before
he minimal explanation is the correct one. The main difference compared with
uniform random sampling is the N? log N-dependence of the number of edges
needed, as opposed to N log N. In fact, there is a continuous spectrum between
hese two opposites. If data come from a series of qualitative states, where each
is generated from the last by resetting the states of d of the N species, then
O(2*(N?/d) log N) edges are needed in expectation. In summary, then, under
hese simple random-process models of data generation, the expected amount of
data needed scales approximately as 2â€œ, as suggested by the lower-bound, and as
something between N log N and N? log N, depending on how similar successive
samples are in the Hamming distance sense.

5. Inferring regulation of the cell cycle in yeast

The cell cycle is the fundamental process by which cells multiply, in order that
a multicellular organism or a colony of unicellular organisms may grow. There
