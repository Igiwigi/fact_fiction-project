saline residue having all the characters of acetate of soda. Acetic acid is therefore
another product formed in this process, but whether this acid is an essential product
of decomposition or not, still remains doubtful. The residue of the distillation con-
tained rubibydran, which was separated by precipitation with basic acetate of Jead, as

before described, and a little sngar, which was obtained from the liquid filtered from
the lead precipitate. The sugar and the alizarine were probably secondary products
of decomposition formed from the rubianic acid by the action of the alkali.
Rubianic Acid. â€”This substance really merits the name of an acid, for though its
acid properties are not well marked, the fact of its giving crystallized compounds
with the alkalies is a sufficient indication of the class in which it should be placed.
It erystallizes from its watery s0lution in silky needles of a pure lemon-yellow colour,
which when dry form a light, bulky interwoven mass. Sometimes it is slowly depo-
ited from its watery s0lution in grains and masses of an indistinctly crystalline form,
which leave an orange tinge. This difference in appearance is due to some impurity,
which may be removed by redissolving the acid in boiling water and adding a little ani-
mal charcoal, when the acid crystallizes rapidly from the filtered solution in needles, as
just mentioned. The watery solution has a light yellow colour, reddens litmus paper
Slightly, and has a distinctly bitter taste, though not so intensely bitter as that of a
solution of rabian. It is soluble in alcohol, bat not in ether. When heated on pla-
tinum foil it melts and then burns with a smoky flame, leaving a slight carbonaceons
residue. When heated in a tube it melts to a brownish-red liquid, which on being
