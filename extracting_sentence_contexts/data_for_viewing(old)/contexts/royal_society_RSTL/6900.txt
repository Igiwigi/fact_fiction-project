in 1851, contains the fortnightly means of the hourly observations of the declination
from July 1842 to July 1846 ; these are corrected for secular change in Table III. of
that volume, and the differences of the declination in each fortnight (s corrected) from
the mean declination of the whole period, are shown in the final column. The mean
of the thirteen fortnights (in the four years) between March 26 and September 23 is
0:40 more easterty, and of the thirteen fortnights between September 24 and March 25
0:40 more westerly than the mean of the year,—thus showing an annual variation of
0:80 or (480), or a semiannual inequality averaging 24” to the East in the thirteen
fortnights from March 26 to September 23, and 24” to the West in the thirteen fort-
nights from September 24 to March 25, This is in accordance with the other stations
previously discussed.

The fact of the existence of an annual variation with analogous phenomena at the
four widely separated stations of Hobarton, St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and
Kew appears to be thus substantiated; its amount is least at St. Helena, intermediate
at the Cape and Hobarton, and greatest at Kew ; the difference in amount is doubtless
to be ascribed, in part at least, to the difference in the amount of the antagonistic force
of the earth's magnetism, tending to retain the magnet in its mean place in opposition
to all disturbing causes. This force (the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic
force) is, in British units, approximately 5'6 at St. Helena, 4-5 at the Cape and Hobarton,
and 3'8 at Kew,
