The time ¢’ is called
retarded time defined by t’ = t — |r — r'|/c, where c is the speed of light in the given medium. For a
wire of length L oriented along the z-direction, carrying a current I, the magnetic vector potential
can be expressed as, A(x, y,Z) = az plLe—/* /(4zrr) [32]. An important point which we wish to make
in the current work, which has not been addressed in the literature on electromagnetism until
now, is the fact that the factor IL plays a key role in determining the radiation field, which has a
much higher value in a metallic antenna as the electrons flow along the length L determined by
the antenna’s spatial dimension. In a dielectric antenna, in the absence of a ground plane, under
electric excitation, the capacitive current can be made high, which is equivalent to the current in
a metallic antenna in terms of flow of charge per unit time, however, in such an antenna, due
to the fact that the charges are bound and the net displacement around the mean position, L,
has atomic dimensions, which is miniscule in comparison to a metallic antenna of a similar size,
the charges can move freely along the spatial dimensions of the antenna. The result is that the
overall value of IL is much lower in a dielectric antenna resulting in low radiation efficiency.
