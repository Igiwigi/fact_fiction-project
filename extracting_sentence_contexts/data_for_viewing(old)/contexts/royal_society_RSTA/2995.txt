of the gain—loss coefficient, y , for the PZ -symmetric mode (alias the GS) (a,c) and the PT -antisymmetric one (alias the first
excited state) (b,d). Subfamilies of stable and unstable solutions are designated by continuous and dashed lines, respectively.

segment shrinks with the increase of the gain—loss coefficient, y. On the other hand, for the
antisymmetric mode, the stability segments becomes shorter as one proceeds from y = 0 to y = 1,
but this segment expands with the further increase of y.

Results concerning the existence and stability of the symmetric and antisymmetric states are
summarized, severally, in parameter planes (y,P) and (¢,P) displayed in figures 6 and 7. First,
a salient feature of these results is that while, at e =0, the antisymmetric mode has a smaller
stability interval than its symmetric counterpart, its stability area at « > 0 is dramatically larger
than the one for the symmetric mode. This difference is explained by the fact that the central
barrier, imposed by ¢ > 0, is favourable for the antisymmetric states, whose wave function nearly
vanishes at x = 0, and is obviously unfavourable for the symmetric states, which tend to have
a maximum at x=0. Eventually, the antisymmetric states disappear at very larger values of e,
where the central potential barrier (4.1), multiplied by a very large ¢, suppresses all possible
modes in the potential box.

Furthermore, while a trend well-known in many PT-symmetric systems is that the increase
of the gain-loss coefficient, y, leads to the breaking of the PT symmetry at a critical value of y
[2-9], the stability region for the antisymmetric mode in figure 6a,b originally demonstrates slight
expansion with the increase of y, before the mode disappears at y exceeding the critical value. On
the contrary, the symmetric mode features the usual trend to the destabilization, following the
growth of y, in figure 6c,d.
