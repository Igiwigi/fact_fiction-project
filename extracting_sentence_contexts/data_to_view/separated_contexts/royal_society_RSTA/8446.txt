Tt will be seen that there is fair agreement between columns 3 and 4, better indeed ~
than the data warranted ; for though we took a large number of readings of 6, in each
of the sets, there was much variation among what should have been constant results,
attributable partly to imperfect working of the contact key in the deflecting circuit
and partly to thermal convection currents in the air, the fibre being necessarily very
slender. We do not, therefore, press these numbers as doing more than show that inertia has
much the same effect on 6, (1-4-4) t, as it has on R ; in other words, that the explanation
of the slopes of the A and B Curves is a problem in pure damping unconnected with the
special conditions obtaining in measurements of the R effect. And this is supported by a fact to which Prof. Hass has kindly drawn our + attentalag
that a body oscillating in a viscous fluid drags some of the fluid with it, and that the
expression for the effect of this on the motion is of the right type to reduce and, perhaps, -
to correct the inertia effect we have observed. Damping Anomalies.
