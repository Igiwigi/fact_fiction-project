if the change had reference only to /. Exactly similar reasoning applies to similar
changes of variables in any other function such as }, a, or a part only of any one of
these. There is, indeed, no reason why the function should be a scalar.

So far, 7 has been assumed an explicit function of the list of variables (25), § 27.
These are by far the most convenient variables for most mathematical operations, and
we shall continue as often as otherwise so to regard 7. For many physical interpreta-
tions, however, it is necessary to regard /, or a part of it, expressed in terms of other
variables. Consider, for instance, air as a dielectric. This will be taken account of by
supposing / to contain a term quadratic in d. Suppose, now, we compress the air till
its density is (say) doubled. We know as a matter of experimental fact, that the
specific inductive capacity will not thereby be largely altered. This will mean, not
that the quadratic expression in d is but slightly altered in form, but that the equal
expression in d’ is thus slightly altered. Moreover, to express simply the fact of
electric and magnetic isotropy of fluids requires that the independent variables should
be the dashed letters. Let then
