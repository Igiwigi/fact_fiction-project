chart shows a crowding together of the isobars and presumably an associated strengthening
of the wind. It is probable that this increase in wind velocity in the Thames and Scheldt
area partly accounts for the second pronounced peak in the disturbance curves for
Southend, Sheerness and Brouwershavn. The mean wind over the North Sea is apparently
still strong enough to maintain the southerly water gradient in existence, and the total
volume of displaced water remains the same. The main surge continues to travel north-
ward along the European coastline, causing surge peaks in the North Friesian Islands.


A NORTH SEA STORM SURGE 391

(iv) 12.004 1 February. Over the whole sea the winds are beginning to moderate, and in
the south are almost due north. This latter fact manifests itself in the decay of the easterly
water gradient between England and Holland which has been in evidence almost through-
out. The southern coasts of Denmark have experienced their maximum disturbances, and
the effect of the earthâ€™s rotation is evident as the disturbance decays. This effect has been
well established in previous investigations, but it is of interest to note that even when such
an exceptionally large disturbance is concerned, the geostrophic effect can be detected in
both the growth and the decay of the oscillation.

(v) 15.00h 1 February to 03.00h 2 February. The further subsidence of the perturbation
of mean sea-level can be traced in the subsequent diagrams. During this period the winds
continued to moderate, but it was not until after 15.00h on 1 February that the mean level

sof the North Sea began to fall.
