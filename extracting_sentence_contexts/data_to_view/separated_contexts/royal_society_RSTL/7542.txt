are accordingly in exactly the inyerse order to that in which they appear in the Table,
$ 60*, That this apparent contradiction is in fact a coincidence appears from the fol-
lowing considerations.

$ 69. The diathermancy of a liquid towards radiant heat, and its resistance to contact
heat, are partly due to one and the same cause. The amount of absorption of radiant
heat by a liquid, as determined by Dr. 'TYNDALL, is estimated by the quantity of heat
which passes through the body 80 as to affect the thermomultiplier ; and the amount
of absorption is directly proportional to the athermaney.
