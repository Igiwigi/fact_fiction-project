But it seems
probable that, as in the case of radium, the penetrating type of rays are deflected,
while the others are not so. My experiments were exclusively concerned with the rays from the bare compound,
which consist for the most part of the easily absorbed type. Only a small fraction of
the total conductivity is due to the other kind, so small, in fact, as to make any
determination of the conductivities difficult, unless some more powerful preparation
than mine were available. The experiments were accordingly confined to the easily
absorbed type of radiation.
