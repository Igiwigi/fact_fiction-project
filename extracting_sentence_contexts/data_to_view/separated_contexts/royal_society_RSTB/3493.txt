A small species of Chlamydomonas, for example, was very slightly
heavier than water and rémained floating at the surface of a gum solution with a
density of 1°005.

2. The Action of Gravity. It is a well-known fact that Euglena, in common with many other micro-organisms,
exhibits an active orientation and movement under the influence of gravity, by which it
is caused to move in a definite direction. These phenomena have been studied by various
observers, especially Scuwarz (84), ADERHOLD (’88), VERWoORN (’89), Massarr (’91),
Jensen (93), JENNINGS (97), Davenport (’97), Sosnowski (99), Parker ('01),
Moors ('03), Lon (’05), and Esrerzey (07). If a mixture of motile Euglenze and mud are shaken up and then allowed to settle
in water, the Euglenee after a short time, even in the dark, come to the surface of the
mud and form a green scum upon it.
