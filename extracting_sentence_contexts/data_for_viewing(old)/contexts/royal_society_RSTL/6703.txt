The same remarks apply to vapours. Methylic alcohol, for example, starts at a lower
level than the iodide of ethyl, but ascends more quickly, and finally reaches a much
higher elevation. 'The same observation may be made of chloroform in comparison with
benzol and the iodide of ethyl.

IT have now to refer to a class of facts which surprised and perplexed me when I first
observed them. As an illustration, I will first take the case of alcohol yapour. A
quantity of this substance, sufficient to depress the mercury gauge 0:5 of an inch, pro-
duced an absorption which caused a deflection of 72* of the galyanometer needle.

While the needle pointed to this high figure, and previously to pumping out the yapour,
I allowed dry air to stream into the tube, and happened while it entered to obserye the
effect upon the galvanometer. 'The needle, to my astonishment, sank speedily to zero,
and went to 25? at the opposite side. The entry of the almost neutral air here not
only abolished the absorption previously observed, but left a considerable balance in
fayour of the face of the pile turned towards the source. A repetition of the experi-
ment, brought the needle down to zero, and sent it to 38* on the opposite 8ide, In like
manner a very small quantity of the vapour of sulphuric ether produced a deflection
