The details of this procedure are important. In early experiments, the antiprotons
were launched at a potential that made them pass easily (and at high energy
relative to the temperatures of the cryogenic environment) through the positrons.
The positrons are cooled by synchrotron radiation in the same way as the
electrons, and the original idea was that collisions with the positrons would cool
the antiprotons, which when cold enough would recombine with positrons and
form antihydrogen. This worked very well, and was the method used for the first
antihydrogen formed in 2002. However, it was later found that the antihydrogen
formed in this way is quite energetic (Madsen et al. 2005). The reason for this
is easy to understand. The rate determining factor for the recombination of a
positron with an antiproton is their relative velocity. However, as antiprotons are
approximately 2000 times more massive than the positrons, their velocity is small
relative to that of the positrons, even when they are much more energetic. In fact,
an antiproton with an energy of 2eV has the same speed as that characteristic of
an ensemble of positrons held at a temperature of 15 K. Thus, the antiprotons do

cool through collisions with the positrons, but rather quickly the relative velocity
of the species is entirely dominated by the velocity of the positrons. Antihydrogen
can thus form by recombination of a 15 K positron and 2eV antiproton almost as
easily as if both particles were at 15K. Antihydrogen is therefore quite likely to
