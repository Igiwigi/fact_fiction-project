It would appear, therefore, from this experiment that the hydrogen, on being
admitted to the platinum black, attacks the portion with which it first comes in
contact, converting the oxygen into water, and then takes its place, instead of first
converting as much as possible of the oxygen into water. Tt is also noteworthy that
the oxygen and hydrogen pumped off did not combine on passing over the heated
platinum black or sponge, but this, perhaps, may be due to the fact that they come
off at different temperatures, and that the bulk of the gas diffused at once into the
Tépler pump, which had a much larger volume than the experimental tube. If this
explanation is correct, then, even on allowing the tube to stand for weeks or months
one could searcely expect all the admitted hydrogen to combine with the oxygen in
the platinum black, since the hydrogen is practically not given off into the vacuum
again, and consequently could not diffuse along to the other end of the tube contain-
ing the occluded oxygen, and vice versd.

That the explanation we have given is substantially correct was proved by slightly
modifying the conditions of experiment.

5°330 grams of platinum black was divided into two portions of 2°608 grams and
