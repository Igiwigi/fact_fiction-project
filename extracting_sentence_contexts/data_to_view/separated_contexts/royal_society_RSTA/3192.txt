The use of MgO as the in situ pressure sensor made
it possible to estimate thermal pressure and the data obtained could be fit with a Berman P-V-T
equation of state as well as a Mie-Griineisen—Debye thermal model. In variance with several
dynamic pressure studies, ByC remains structurally stable in this P-T range, only displaying the
previously reported relaxation at 10 GPa (and at ambient temperature) which is accompanied by
a monotonic reduction of the axial ratio. This is best exemplified by the fact that only a single

Figure 5. Results of the Berman fit [28] of the P-V-T data using EosFit7c [29]. The thermal expansion parameters and dK/d7
were varied while the 300 K parameters for Vo, Ky and K,’ were held fixed to the values listed in table 1 and depicted in figure 1.
