it “‘even the seeds, notwithstanding that at first sight they have not the
st resemblance to leaves, are still in fact simply coalescent leaves,”* and again
«that the stamens also are in their nature simply leaves. In one word,
whole plant, whose parts at first sight appear so excessively diverse, we see,
ture consideration, nothing more than leaves and stem, since the root belongs
Jatter.”t From these quotations it appears that Wotrr, though thoroughly
ed with the parts of the flower, did not distinguish sporangia as a separate
y, but as modifications of leaves or parts of leaves.
3 same was essentially Goxrrir’s view, arrived at by a distinct course of
sing. Gorrurt (1790) at the outset drew attention to the fact that certain
or parts of plants sometimes “change and pass into the form of adjacent parts
wholly or in greater or less degree.” Of this change or “ metamorphosis ” he
nishes three kinds, regular, irregular, and occasional; the third, since it
s only monstrous developments, may be at once dismissed. Under regular
mea" sive metamorphosis GorTHE included the changes involved in the develop-
1F of the individual; the series, cotyledons, foliage leaves, bracts, and floral
3s in an annual plant serve as an illustration. As irregular or retrogressive
orphosis he designated such cases as the petaloid development of stamens,
parts which stand higher in the progressive series take, as they develop, the
yacters of a lower grade.
