This substitution has been shown to be due to the antichromatic responses. In
favour of the presence of this receptor is the fact that this part of the spectrum has a very
high brightness. It is unlikely that this would be the case if there were in fact no receptors
present from 6000 or 6200A on the one side, to 5400A on the other. Stiles & Crawford
found quite a different retinal direction effect with yellow rays than for red, green, and blue
rays. Even allowing for experimental error, the magnitude of their effect in the case of
yellow was not the mean between that for red and that for green.
