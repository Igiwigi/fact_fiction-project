derstand the true condition and theory of the electric power.

1178. The preceding considerations already point to the following conelusions :
bodies cannot be charged absolutely, but only relatively, and by a principle which is
the same with that of induction. All charge is sustained by induction. All pheno-
mena of intensity include the principle of induction. All excitation is dependent on
or directly related to induction. All currents involve previous intensity and there-
fore previous induction. InpvcrTIoNn appears to be the essential function both in the
first development and the consequent phenomena of electricity.

q iii. Electrometer and inductive apparatus employed.

1179. Leaving for a time the further consideration of the preceding facts until they
can be collated with other results bearing directly on the great question of the na-
ture of induction, I will now describe the apparatus I have had occasion to use ; and
in proportion to the importance of the principles sought to be established is the ne-
cessity of doing this s0 clearly, as to leave no doubt of the results behind.


COULOMB'S ELECTROMETERâ€”PARTICULAR ADJUSTMENTS. d

1180. Electrometer. The measuring instrument I haye employed has been the
torsion balance electrometer of CouLomB, constructed, generally, according to his
instructions*, but with certain variations and additions, which I will briefly describe.
The lower part was a glass cylinder eight inches in height and eight inches in dia-
