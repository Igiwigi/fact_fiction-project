the sethereal constituent essential and peculiar to MAXWELL’s theory.

It has been definitely established that all but the last constituent of the current
are in themselves true movements of electricity, or at least effectively equivalent to
such, so that so long as we retain the definite concept of an electrical entity the
origin of these different constituents merely remains a matter of kinematics, and they
have, in fact, been fully dealt with on this basis.*

(c) H, the magnetic force, defined in a similar manner to the electric force, with
the aid of the concept of a magnetic pole, but now without the possibility of a local
contribution due to surrounding magnetic polarity if the point is inside the matter.

It is perhaps as well to emphasise the fact that both the electric and magnetic
forces are defined in a theoretical manner which almost excludes the possibility of
direct experimental verification. Electromagnetic measurements, particularly as
regards the fields inside the matter, are concerned almost entirely with matter in bulk,
and it is then only the mechanical or molar parts of these forces that are then under
observation, the local parts, if they exist at all, being balanced on the spot by other
forces of an origin not at present under review. We have however evidence that »
these local parts of the forces do exist.

(d) B, the magnetic induction, which is defined in the elementary theory in
terms of the magnetic foree H and the magnetic polarisation intensity I by the
relation
