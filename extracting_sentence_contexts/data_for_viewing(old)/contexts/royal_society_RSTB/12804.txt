interactions between elements belonging to the different frag-
ments. As shown in figure 6a-d, the leading cluster
immediately stops locomotion and stretches, elongating in
both directions along the stripe of SDF la: all its component
individuals (both at the front and at the rear area) in fact
express the migratory protein Cxcr4 and therefore try to
extend towards the chemical stripe, resulting in a net null dis-
placement. The trailing aggregate conversely preserves its
chemical-induced migration. Only the particles at its front
area in fact express Cxcr4, while its mature rosette is
formed by pE agents, which instead have the non-migratory
SDFla-receptor Cxcr7: such a receptor polarization allows the
movement of the overall fragment. As soon as the two frag-
ments come close enough they adhere and the normal
movement of the remaining body of the primordium is
resumed. This behaviour is in remarkable agreement with
the corresponding empirical results described in [11]. Interest-
ingly, the substantial stretching of the leading fragment is
independent from the presence of the trailing one, as
observed both experimentally and computationally via abla-
tion of the trailing cluster, see figure 6e,f and [11], respectively.
On the other hand, in [11], the arrest of the leading cluster is
