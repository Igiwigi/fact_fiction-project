That charcoal is more inflammable than the diamond may
be explained from the looseness, of its texture, and from the
hydrogene it contains ; but the diamond appears to burn in
oxygene with as much facility as plumbago, so that at least
one distinction supposed to exist between the diamond and
common carbonaceous substances is done away by these re-
searches, :

A fact which I formerly noticed, the blackening of diamond
by the long continued action of heated potassium, induced me
to suspect in. the beginning of these inquiries, that common
charcoal might owe its colour, opacity, and conducting power,
to the circumstance of its containing minute. portions. of the
metals of the alkalies, or earths, and plumbago to. the iron it
contains; but when I found that charcoal made. from oil of
turpentine, which left no residuunp1 in burning, and charcoal
precipitated from carburetted hydrogene gas by. chlorine,
had the same properties, it was necessary to, renounce this
opinion.

The only chemical difference perceptible between diamond
