Srounded globule in its interior.
2 The chorion is a single, simple, transparent, structureless membrane.
= The other species of Phalangide which I have dissected are Phalangium cornutum,
 SLeiobunus rotundus, and Opilio agrestis, all of which, in the arrangement of their gene-
ative organs, agreed in all essential particulars with the preceding species.
XY In Laobunus rotundus the ovarian nuclei were as distinct as in Nemastoma bimacu-
Platum, but rather smaller ; in P. cornutum they are more delicate, and the contents are
Sless granular. The formation of the egg, of the Purkinjean vesicle, and of the macula
Proceed almost exactly as in the preceding species, and need not therefore be again
detailed. In L£. rotundus, however, the macula has not the appearance of a vyesicle, but
rather of a cloud of small granules compacted together.
— In ome cases the ovary presents a rather unusnal appearance, from the fact that the
$talks of the ovarian follicles are not circular, but elliptic; this peculiarity struck me
more particularly in Leiobunus.
: The eggs of P. cornutum begin to darken when they are about 33ggths of an inch in
diameter ; and the yelk then consists of yery fine particles, not more than 2g4ggth of an
inch in diameter.
In P. cornutum the egg had become quite opake when it was about zZZgths of an
