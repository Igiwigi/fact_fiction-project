It is thus evident that the principal part of the change in the nervous system
of this insect occurs during the first month of the pupa state, and that it is not
regularly progressive, but takes place at intervals. Upon what these apparent
irregularities depend it is difficult to determine. Perhaps they may be the
result of a partial exhaustion of the vital powers, during the effort of transfor-
mation, and which require an interval of repose to re-establish their activity.
Thus we find, that during the first four days of the pupa state, there is but little
alteration of structure, beyond what exists at the actual period of changing from
the larva; the energy of the insect having been partially exhausted during the
effort of transformation. But when it has remained for some time at rest, its
energy is restored, and the change again advances. That such is in reality the
case seems to be supported by the fact, that when a larya has become 80 ex-

hausted as to be unable to rid itself of the exuviz, and complete its transforma-
tion, owing to its having been prevented from remaining at rest during the
proper period, the change in its nervous system is neyer 80 much advanced
as in those which have transformed without interruption ; nor does it make
any further progress even in seven days, while the insect itself generally
perishes in less than a fortnight.

After the insect has remained for about five weeks in the pupa state, scarcely
