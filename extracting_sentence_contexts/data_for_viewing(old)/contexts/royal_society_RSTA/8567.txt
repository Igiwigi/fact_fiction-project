It might have been expected that correcting for the helix effect in this way would have
brought the values of 6, for m-} and m— to equality. That it has not done so is due
to the fact that the helix effect as measured is greater than that which accompanies
the R effect, because in the case of an R effect the helix acts on magnetism which is

reversing, and its effect is due to the difference between two opposing forces, whereas,
when measured directly it is due to a force in one direction only. It will be seen from
the figures that a smaller value of the helix effect is in fact required to bring the corrected
values of 0, to equality. There is no error arising from this cause, however, when all
four values of 9, are taken into account.

The signs of m are connected with those of 4, (corrected for helix) by the rule that
a -+ sign before 6, means a rotation of the specimen in an anti-clockwise direction
when seen from above.

Thus the first line in Table I. corresponds with m--, a change of upper pole from N
to 8, which caused the specimen to rotate in a clockwise direction seen from above
(— 6,), that is to say, in a direction opposite to that of the electrons, as it should do.

The column headed ,/k, contains the ratios of pairs of successive deflections in
