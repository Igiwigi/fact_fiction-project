It need scarcely be stated that the very distinctive difference between the com-
position of the 8olid and gaseous products of this powder are, generally, such as

would have been predicted from the comparatively small proportion borne by the
oxidising agent to the oxidisable constituents in the mining powder. It will be seen presently that the experiments with mining powder presented
other features of great interest in addition to those elicited by the chemical
examination of the products of explosion. In concluding our observations on these,
we 8hould point out that fresh confirmation is afforded by this experiment of the fact
insisted upon by us, namely, that hyposulphite must be classed among the invariable*
products of explosion of gunpowder in closed 8paces. An examination of the three complete series of results obtained by the explosion of
pebble, R. L. G., and F. G. powders in closed spaces in which their gravimetric
densities varied from 0'1 to 0'9 per cent. of the space, and which are given in detail
in Tables I. and I1.,} snggests the following observations additional to those included
in our firs} memoir, on the nature and relations to each other of the solid products
furnished by the several powders.
