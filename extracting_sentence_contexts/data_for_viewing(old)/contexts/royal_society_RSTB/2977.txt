Having dealt with the nucellar region of the seed we pass on to the description of
its integument and peripheral regions generally. The free part of the integument,
the canopy, may be taken first, whilst in succeeding paragraphs the palisade layer,
the chalaza, and the vascular system are in turn described,


THE PALAOZOIC SEED, LAGENOSTOMA LOMAXI. 203

The Canopy.

This name may be conveniently applied to the whole of the complicated free
portion of the integument which forms the hollow, fluted dome around the plinth
and pollen-chamber. Its essential peculiarity depends on the fact that it is not a
mere sclerotic wall but a series of tangentially joined structures of considerable radial
extent and differentiation. The outer surface of the canopy entirely resembles that
of the rest of the seed, and there is no external mark indicating the actual zone at
which the integument becomes free. Its lining layer, however, is fluted and closely
invests the upper portion of the pollen-chamber. It springs from the margin of the
plinth, which is slightly cusped, so that even at its actual insertion.incipient furrows
are already present on this lining layer. That the plinth has an angled contour may
be inferred from many longitudinal sections, eg., U. C. L., R. 1.; W. 1930 (ef.
fig. 19 and phot. 6), in which its halves are asymmetrical and unequal. That its
convex surface bore low undulations is seen in the section U. C. L., R. 3, a (phot. 9),
where the two obtuse upwardly directed angles of the plinth correspond with the
folds in the canopy above.
