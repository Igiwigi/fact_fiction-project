the crater till about 1 o'clock on the Wednesday afternoon, one very curious fact
requires to be explained. There can be no doubt that the reflection of fire was seen in
the steam cloud at 5.20 p.m. on Tuesday and repeatedly after that. All witnesses
agree on this point. It could not have been due to the burning of the sulphuretted
hydrogen gas, as this gives a colourless flame, and after passing up through boiling
water would require contact with something incandescent to ignite it. On the other
hand, it may have been, and very probably was in part, the burning of the withered
bush which clothed the interior walls of the crater. Many describe the fire, seen after
the great outburst at midnight on Tuesday, as “like fire running through a cane
brake.” On Tuesday morning the bush in the crater was green; on Wednesday
morning it was burnt, and it is in every way likely that some of the “ flames” were
due to bush fires. They may have been ignited by flashes of lightning or by incan-
descent stones which had fallen, sufficiently hot to set fire to the timber. In the
