In this way both the resistance per unit
length 7) and the temperature coefficient « were determined. It will be noticed that in the case of the
large wires the prolonged annealing is more effective in diminishing the resistance than the reduction of

diameter by “evaporation” in increasing it, while the contrary may be noticed in the finer wires. Wires
No. 1 to No. 7 show a marked diminution in the temperature coefficient with diameter, a fact well worth
a special investigation. Wires No. 8 to No. 10 were probably drawn from a specimen of impure platinum. As described in Section 10, the diameters of the wires were measured directly by means of a micro-
seope.
