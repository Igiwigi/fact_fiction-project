The p-sequence.—In determining the formule constants for the Sharp series, it
immediately becomes evident that they are based on the P-sequence, viz., that which
in the alkalies give the Principal series. It is impossible to get constants based on
the S-sequence to reproduce the lines within considerable multiples of the possible
errors. Not only does the P-sequence do so, but it will be found in correspondence
that the Principal series are formed on the S-sequence, viz., that which in the alkalies
gives the Sharp series. Confirmatory evidence is also afforded from the facts that
the relationships between the constants are of a similar kind to those found in the
alkalies and that the limit of the Principal series (S-sequence) is the same as the
variable part of the first line of the Sharp whilst that of the Sharp is not rigorously
the same as the variable part of the first line of the Principal. In other words, VP
and VS denoting sequences, the limit of the Principal series is VP (1), whilst that for
the Sharp series deviates considerably from VS (1). This fact renders the notation of
the sequences introduced in Part I. confusing. The confusion may, however, to some
extent be avoided if small letters are used to denote sequences and large letters the
lines or series. Thus, in these elements VP (im) = s(m) and VS (m) = p (m).

The features of the p-sequence, as developed in Part L., are (1) « = 1+ where f is
a fraction (2) if the denominator be written in the form 1—W (1—m)+u+am"},
where W is the atomic weight term, « is negative, a/u is a constant (215), « is
proportional to the atomic volume of the element, and p(1) =S(). The s-sequence
has (1)”“=f, a negative, « about °5 less than the corresponding value for the
principal and s(1) is not P(c) but very nearly so, being always slightly less.
