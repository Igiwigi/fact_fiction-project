accentuated by the exigencies of the diagram, the canals having been represented by
the same sized dots, and the circumference being less. However, an examination with
the microscope shows that the tangential arrangement of the series in the two is about
the same, and it is for this reason that we chose these sections for illustration. The
upper section is seven years above the wound and the lower one five below it, the wound
being where there are seventeen annual rings. It must not be inferred, however, that
the fact of a relatively greater response above than below the wound is essential to the
accumulation of canals in the inner years above. The absolute extent and the fact
that it passes through the nodal region into the younger years are the determining
- factors.

The reason for the great extent of the vertical response in comparison with the radial
is probably due to the fact that the cambium is active throughout the whole vertical
extent of the tree at the time of the wound, whereas in the course of its radial activity
the cambium passes through dormant winter periods. There are also greater facilities
for vertical distribution in connection with the currents in the tree.

When the young plant is examined for comparison with the older form it will be
seen how little evidence of response in succeeding years it shows, and how evanescent
here the wound stimulus apparently is. Any of the wound areas in fig. 4 or in the
photographs of Plates 10-13 will showt he lack of persistence of the stimulus in the
radial direction. Special attention may be directed to Nos. 5 and 7 of fig. 4, and to
Photo. 60 (Plate 13). In the latter there are only three canals in the year succeeding
the wound, and yet there is a double series of numerous canals in the wound year itself.
When the vertical extent is compared, the prevalence of local series in the young plant
