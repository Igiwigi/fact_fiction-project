I 80 small as not to bring into question the identity of an object.

S These are the data furnished by observation for every object in a complete
2 Sweep; and I shall now explain how from these data, compared with the mean
Z places of all those known objects which are to be found in authentic catalogues
= brought up to a given epoch, and which occur in a s&weep, the mean places
S of all the wnknown ones for the same epoch may be obtained, with the greatest
> degree of accuracy of which the system of observing is susceptible,—without the
7 necessity of taking into direct consideration any uranographical or instru-
5 mental correction whatever,—and that in a manner which, as will appear, carries
FI with it a moral certainty of eliminating (0 far as they can be eliniinated by
E any process) whatever errors may have been committed in the observations of
EZ the zero stars. In fact, if we consider all the corrections which we can pos-

E sibly have occasion to apply to obseryations of this kind, whether arising from

S the uranographical reductions, (viz. precession, aberration, nutation and refrac-

= tion,) or from instrumental mis-adjustment, such as extrameridional situation

z of the plane of the sweep, or its deviation from a vertical ; error and rate of

the chronometer ; error of evaluation of the divisions of the sector, &c.; or,
lastly, even from instability of the instrument itself, due to hygrometrical or
pyrometrical causes, whose operation, though very irregular, is still to a cer-
