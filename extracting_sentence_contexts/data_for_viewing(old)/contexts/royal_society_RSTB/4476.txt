TIMBER AND THEIR BEARING ON THE STRUCTURE OF CELL-WALL IN PLANTS. 63

Specimens of Spruce and of Ash, measuring 10 inches by $ inch by } inch, were
bent to various degrees, and held in the bent position until cold and dry. Sections
through the middle of such bowed specimens showed that the permanent deformation
had invariably been produced by the development of planes of slipping in the walls
of the tracheides or fibres on the compression side of the specimen. These planes
of slipping were regularly distributed through the deformed portion, being most
abundant at the region of greatest deformation. In cases where extreme bending
of the specimen was carried out, initial failures and buckling of the fibres and
tracheides took place. Even where only the very slightest permanent bowing was
produced, it was possible to demonstrate planes of slipping in the cell-walls in the
middle part of the specimen. The facts for Ash and for Spruce, permanently deformed
after soaking in warm water or steaming, are thus in entire agreement with those
-obtained in the compression failures of these-woods in the air-dried condition.

Fractures IN LonNGItupINAL TENSION.

The gross features of the tension fractures of a number of woods, including Oak
and Ash, have been described and figured by Fuuron (Joe. cit.). He found that the
slipping,* which resulted in fracture, invariably occurred along the planes of the
medullary rays, so that the fracture had an irregular splintery character, as seen on
the tangential face, and was manifested on the radial face, as a straight break across
the specimen. The results obtained for the tension fractures of Spruce, Ash, and
Pitch Pine, in the present work, are not in agreement with those of Funron, even
