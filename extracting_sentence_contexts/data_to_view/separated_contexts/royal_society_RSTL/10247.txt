HICKS ON THE THEORY OF VORTEX RINGS. 738

f there are no added rotations Ag, A', will therefore be of order 1 with reference to
By always taking them to be of this order therefore the approximation will
ill be true when there are added circulations.
4, It will be convenient here to consider the equation giving the pressure at any
of the core, including the case where mall vibrations are superposed on the
y motion. The equations of motion are, d being the density, and taking the

ES question. It is a function depending in general on the path of integration, but þ is
Z independent of this (is in fact due to the added irrotational motion) and is single

valued when y is 80. When y is many-valued (as, for instance, in the case of

Pulzations), þ—Ay is single-valued. Section IL. —Steady motion.
