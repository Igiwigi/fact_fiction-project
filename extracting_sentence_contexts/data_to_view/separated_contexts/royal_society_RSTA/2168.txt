planar Brownian motion, winding angle

distribution, point vortices Let R(t) be a two-dimensional Brownian motion in R?

with unit diffusivity, so that E|R(f)|? =4t. Take @(f) to
be the total winding angle with respect to the origin
accumulated by R(t) up to time f. It is a known fact that
Jean-Luc Thiffeault Brownian motion avoids the origin with probability 1,
e-mail: jeanluc@math.wisc.edu so the winding angle is well defined. Since the winding
angle takes value in (—oo,0o) instead of [0,27), we
can view the Brownian motion as taking place in the
universal cover of C\{0}, ie. the Riemann surface of log z. Spitzer [1] in 1958 showed that the normalized
winding angle converges to a standard Cauchy distribution
