Hitherto it has been customary to. regard the convolutionary arrangement as
dependent in a great, measure upon the progressive growth and development of the
cortex, restricted and modified by the encircling cranial bones, the varied folds and
complex fissures being really in this sense mere accidents of development, their
uniformity of distribution in different classes of animals being due to the uniform
action of the forces thus brought into play. Our investigations would lead us to a
far different eonclusion, nor can we, judging from our histological data, regard the
divisions mapped off from each other by fissures and primary sulci as other than
structurally distinct organs. In no case 1s this 80 palpable as in the various regions
of the great limbic lobe, for here both a superficial survey, 1.e., of the 8tructure of
the cortex and an investigation of the deep medullary connexions of these regions
conclusively confirm the statement now advanced. In the former memoir* I insisted
strongly upon the fact that certain sulei or fissures formed gharply-defined boundary

lines betwixt regions differing in the structure of their cortex : these were the crucial
and infra-parietal sulci, together with the fisxure of RoLaNDo. My later investigations
enable me till further to extend this lisb by others, viz.: the limbie fissure, olfactory
sulcus, and primary parietal suleus. Thus in the Sheep and Pig we find that the
crucial and sub-parietal sulei separates the five-laminated cortex, with its clustered
ganglionic series, from the six-laminated cortex, with its solitary ganglion cells, the
