From the above experiments we see how difficult it is to reduce the whole of the s8ub-
oxide; a fact, which explains the reason why no good determinations as to the amount
of oxygen present in copper have as yet been obtained.


ELECTRIC CONDUCTING POWER OF PURE COPPER AND ITS ALLOYS. 89

2, Effect of Carbon.

According to KarsrEN*, copper takes up 0:2 per cent. of carbon; we could not, how-
ever, obtain wires containing more than 0-05 per cent. This small quantity causes the
conducting power to decrease considerably. 'Thus galvanoplastic copper in small pieces
was fused down with lamp-black, and gave, upon analysis, 0:05 per cent. of carbonÞ ;
and for the conducting power we found
