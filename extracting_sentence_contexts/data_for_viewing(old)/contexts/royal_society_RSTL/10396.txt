From this we find
t=:-0815 centim.
and finally

A=25753 centims.

The observations on coil B gave the same value for the thickness of the wire and
covering, and we get for it

a=25'766 centims.

The method here adopted to determine the value of the mean radius allows for the
fact that in winding one layer may sink 80mewhat into the one beneath.

Let the figure (fig. 3) represent a section of the coils by a vertical plane through

the axis ; let the coils be placed with their lettered sides down as in the figure. This
we call position 1 throughout.

In position 2 the lettered 8ide of B was turned uppermost.

In position 3 the lettered 8ide of A als was uppermost, while in position 4,
A remained uppermost while B was again inverted.

Thus if yB mean that the lettered ide of B was down, we have
