that magnetic bodies differ exceedingly, both in ssceptibility.
of this quality and in the degree of the pertinacity with which
they retain it (which may be called their retentive power), is
not an hypothesis, but an acknowledged fact. 1t is only in
the mode of its extension to new cases of magnetics that we
can be led into any fallacies. Whether these two qualities
(susceptibility and retentive power) be, or be not mutually
dependent, this is not the place to enquire. Probably they
are not 80, at least directly : and the new facts almost con-
vert this probability into certainty ; at all events, at present
we $hall for greater generality suppose them independent.

observed the following facts, which set the principle stated in the text in a very
clear light. A natural magnet, armed with soft iron, terminating in a cylindrical
surface, was made to support a load hooked on to another piece of soft iron, termi-
nating also in a cylindrical surface, s0 that its contact with the former was limited
to a physical line. The weight it would usually support varied from 27 to 33 1bs.,
according to the caution used in increasing the load. On loading it with 3olbs. it
became necessary to add the remaining weight by degrees, a quarter of a pound at
a time, and to wait a short time after each addition. At about 324 lbs. the weights
usually-fell from the magnet, and it was observed on replacing them, that it would
no longer support more than 3o, and that some minutes must be $uffered to elapse
before it could be brought to its former load, It was thus evident that the magnet
required time for the developement of its full virtue. Again, having loaded the
magnet by degrees up to 32 1bs., if the contact was broken for an instant by seizing
