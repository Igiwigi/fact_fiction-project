In fact the cloud
was a comet's tail on a s8mall scale. It proved that matter of almost infinite tenuity is
competent to shed forth light of similar quality, and in far greater quantity than that
discharged by the tails of comets *. 'These facts render the statement intelligible that even when all reasonable precautions
appear to have been taken it is not easy to escape every trace of chemical action on
firss charging the experimental tube even with an inert substance. In my earlier
experiments, when distilled water only was employed to cleanse the tube, the first
experiment with air alone was sure to develope an actinic cloud of a beautiful fern-
leaf pattern. And eyen now, after the most careful employment of the soft s0ap and
Hot water, the first charge of pure nitric, or of pure hydrochloric acid often developes a
blue and exceedingly delicate actinic cloud.
