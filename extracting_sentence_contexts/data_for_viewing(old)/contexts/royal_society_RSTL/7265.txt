E 12. The term © distribution of weight” may be defined as that operation by which a

Z compound weight is resolved into its component weights, or by which it is made up
from those weights, regard being had to some special system of such events which is
the subject of consideration.

* Two eminent chemists have recently given independent testimony to the yalue of a more real standard
than is afforded by this imaginary © molecule,” Dr, Horwaxnx, in his © Modern Chemistry,? has adopted the term
<« erith” to denote such a real unit,—a crith being the weight of 1000 cub. centims, of hydrogen at standard tem-
perature and preggure. Profeasor WILLLAMS0N has, from similar motives of utility, adopted an absolute yolume ??
of 11:2 litres, which is the bulk of a gramme of hydrogen, also at standard temperature and pressure. T now
propose to adyanee another step in the game direction, and to substitute the real for the fictitious unit, not for a
special object, alone, or to paye the way for more important theories, but for all the purposes of chemistry.

A <«distributed weight ” is a weight which, in 8uch a system of events, is resolved into
two or more weights or made up from such weights.
