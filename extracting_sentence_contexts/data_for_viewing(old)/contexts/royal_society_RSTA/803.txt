composition. In the o,-oz composition, however, the time of extrema t = 2/2 of the pure oy case
is retained. The overall similarity of the combined two Pauli case Hamiltonians is due to the fact
that, in such combinations, there will always be a counter-diagonal Pauli matrix (either o or oy).
In the next section, we will study this ‘mixing’ behaviour by counter-diagonal elements in the
extended dynamical model for bivariate paradigms.

The final issue concerns the extent to which considering the most general C? Hamiltonian,
involving components from all three Pauli matrices, can modify temporal dynamics. With
our previous observation, the triple Pauli combination will not add essential features to the
temporal behaviour of the probability outcome of A, because the counter-diagonal position in
the Hamiltonian was already covered by double Pauli combinations (figure 5).
