Another paper directly related to MDA campaigns for STH
and schistosomiasis and their broader impact is that by Bartlett
and colleagues [25]. They report on a knowledge, attitudes and
practices (KAP) study conducted among SAC in regions of
Angola, in schools that had either received: (i) MDA for STH
and WASH interventions; (ii) MDA alone; or (iii) neither.
These authors concluded that the provision of school-based
MDA and WASH interventions improves health behaviours
at school and at home that would support reduced STH and
schistosome infection in SAC. This paper contributes to
the sparse body of evidence on the KAP of SAC, despite the
fact that this is generally the targeted demographic for PC inter-
ventions against STH and schistosomiasis. Interestingly, the
authors report improved water use and health behaviours
in the homes of SAC attending schools where PC and
WASH are in place, compared to those at schools with no
expanded WASH intervention, and even a difference between
children at schools receiving PC and no WASH compared
to children at schools with no provision of either [25]. This
supports the delivery of messaging given during MDA
campaigns about the importance of sanitation and hygiene to
prevent re-infection.
