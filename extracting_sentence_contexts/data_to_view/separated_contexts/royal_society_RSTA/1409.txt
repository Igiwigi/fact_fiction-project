evidence, in our most recent work, we demonstrated that the best distribution of CNCs in PSA 13

Because the AFM nano-adhesion measurements rely on small nominal contact areas (i.e. the DR
surface area of the colloidal probe), we believe that the effects of surface roughness on adhesion : 4
are less pronounced. In fact, regardless of CNC loading, the average surface roughness of nine 1

15nm. In such a case, we see a continuous improvement in latex film adhesion with increasing : Ss
CNC content, despite the significant variability in the measurements potentially resulting from Ss

inconsistent indentation depth (as seen by the slight curvature in the repulsive region of the F-d
curves) or probe contamination. However, over larger surface areas one can no longer disregard
the macroscopic topography of the latex film and this, on the other hand, is reflected in the PSA
performance.
