indication that the fibres of the stria medullaris acustica enter it. Probably only those
which form a part of the decussation of the lateral lemniscus, the corpus trapezoideum,
pass through it. Certainly the ventral part of the lateral lemniscus system is closely
connected with the ventral nucleus of the seventh. This is well demonstrated in
Prof. Wiuson’s transverse Weigert series. Although some of these fibres appear to
fray out within that nucleus, others of these undoubtedly pass through. ‘This apparent

with the lateral lemniscus, would be, if proven true, a very suggestive fact for the
phylogenetic development of that body.

The lateral lemniscus (/em.l., fig. 17) passes dorsal to or through the nucleus ventralis,
or the seventh motor nucleus, as well as through the superior olive. It then turns
dorso-laterally in a curve convex to the brain wall, and swings dorsalward to the mid-
brain. It lies immediately beneath the outer limiting membrane of the lateral surface
of the medulla, ventral to the posterior projection of the inferior colliculus, and therefore
lateral to the brachium conjunctivum (br.c., fig. 17). It may be seen more easily in the
next figure, where it sends fibres into the colliculus inferior (¢.i., figs. 18 and 19).
Following a few of the more lateroventral fibres of this bundle they are seen to turn
lateralward at a sharp angle, ventral to the pes pedunculi, and in the medial geniculate
body (m.g.b., figs. 20 and 21). To determine whether or not all of these fibres have
