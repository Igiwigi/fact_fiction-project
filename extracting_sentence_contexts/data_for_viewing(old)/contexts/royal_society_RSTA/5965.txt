In [9], we were interested in sharpness of the instantaneous estimate (3.5) with respect to Po
and this is verified in figure 2b where we plot Rp, (Wky,py) as function of Po for different values of
Ko, revealing a power-law dependence of the form Rp, (Wky,Py) ~ ope! >) for large Po. Sharpness
of the refined estimate (3.6) with respect to the second parameter Ko was then established in [73]
by analysing solutions of Problem 3.1, although the parameters a, b and c were found to have
values different from the values given in (3.6).

As regards the companion question about sharpness of the finite-time estimate (3.7), in [73],
it was shown that flow evolutions corresponding to the optimal initial data %x,,p, obtained by
solving Problem 3.1 for fixed Ko and different Pp saturate the bound in estimate (3.7) with respect
to Po, in the sense that the maximum attained values of the palinstrophy max;>9 P(w(t)) grow in
proportion to Py when Ko remains fixed. On the other hand, dependence of the prefactor Â®(Reo)
on Rep, or on Kg, was found to be more nuanced, which can be attributed to the fact that the
flow trajectories considered correspond to initial data which is optimal in the instantaneous sense
only. The vortex-dynamics mechanisms realizing the extreme flow behaviour discussed above
