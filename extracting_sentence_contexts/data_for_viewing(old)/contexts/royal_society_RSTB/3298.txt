Potonié* afterwards demonstrated that the surface-features which Weiss described
as leaf-bases were those of a medullary cast. ZeitLERt subsequently revived
Etcawap’s generic name Schizodendron which was applied to casts, generically
identical with those described by Weiss, as having priority over Tylodendron. The
close resemblance between T'ylodendron and the casts of the pith of Araucaria and
Agathis, both as regards the casts of the medullary rays and leaf-traces, and in the
peculiar increase in diameter which in the recent stems characterises the pith in the
region of the branch “ whorls,” is clearly shown in Poronmi’s figures. Petrified wood
found in connection with Tylodendron is of the Araucarian type. In all probability,
therefore, Schizodendron represents the pith-cast of a Paleozoic plant—possibly
Walchia, a genus which would seem to include species bearing a greater similarity
to Araucaria than to any other existing genus. ZrrLLERt, who holds the view that
Schizodendron stands for pith-casts of Walchia, mentions the fact that in many places
Walchia is the only Gymnosperm found in association with the pith-casts.

Gomphostrobus.—This genus was instituted by Marion§ for certain fossils from the
Permian of Lodéve, possessing vegetative characters bearing a resemblance to those
of Walchia and distinguished by monospermic deciduous cone-seales with a bifureated
lamina. Srerzet|| states that he has found Gomphostrobus at Chemnitz in
association with Araucarioxylon wood, Figures of this plant of somewhat doubtful
affinity may be found in the works of Poronti, Zeriier, and others.

A portion of a vegetative branch bearing leaves like those of Araucaria imbricata
has been recently described by ZerLteR from the Lower Gondwana rocks (Permo-
Carboniferous) of India as Araucarites Oldhami. We have more satisfactory
