whole partial. In addition, the Delaunay-based method confirms its ability to detect and render
transients. Indeed, note the vertical structure centred around the attack time (0.05 s, figure 8c).

Finally, an experiment was performed to reconstruct the harmonic and attack structure of
the cello sound by applying the reconstruction technique, i.e. equation (3.3), with masking
domains identified via the Delaunay technique. One can see the temporal representation of the
reconstructed signal in figure 7b, which looks very similar to the original excerpt (cf. figure 7a).
An auditory comparison confirms how close the two signals are to each other (cf. electronic
supplementary material).


In terms of post-processing, for both the RV and Delaunay-based methods, note that when the
modes are harmonically related, one can benefit from the fact that the instantaneous frequencies
of harmonic components are multiples of the fundamental frequency to gather together basins
of attraction/mode domains associated with a given mode. Note also that this pertains to the
problem of reconstructing trajectories of partials in the context of additive synthesis [30]. This is
a topic that we will seek to address in the near future. A fruitful application for this harmonic
identification/extraction is the separation of the noisy part from the pseudo-periodic part of any
given sound. This is a key step in preserving the perceptual naturalness and in achieving high-
quality results in advanced audio processing techniques such as time-scaling, transposition or
sound morphing [31]. Indeed, one has to process differently the pseudo-deterministic part from
the noisy part (e.g. for time-scaling and transposing sounds, the noisy attack part has to remain
unchanged).
