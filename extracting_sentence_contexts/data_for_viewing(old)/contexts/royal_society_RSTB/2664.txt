of 1882 and 1883, the inevitable conclusion to be drawn would be, either that the
compact septum of Cyathophyllum, Caryophyllia, &c., was composed of individual
spicules, or that the whole septum had a structure entirely analogous with a single

spicule.
The type of structure in Group (2) of Kocx is based upon the spheroid and

ellipsoid seen in transverse sections of certain Madreporarians, and in embryonic
stages of Astroides calycularis. This type is characteristic, it is assumed, of recent
corals (Madreporarian) ; at the same time the Rugose corals seem closely allied.

After all, therefore, a review of Kocu’s work leaves us with a number of facts and
several important figures, but in as great confusion as ever regarding the ultimate
structural unit in Madreporaria. It is almost a relief to return to the sclerenchymatous
nodule of Epwarps and Haims. For what is this spheroid? Is ita spicule? We
can see and separate the spicule, then why not the spheroid? It is noteworthy
that the spheroid has been presented from first to last by one or two transverse sections,
no longitudinal section has demonstrated it. The “ septal spine” of Pholidophyllum
might be compared with a spicule, it certainly never could be called a spheroid.
Neither had the primary streak and stereoplasm of Caryophyllia, &c., ever betrayed,
in figures given, any individual structure akin either to a septal spine, a spicule, a
spheroid, or sclerenchymatous nodule.
