There are several reasons for the slowness in implementation of Ciamician’s vision. These
include World War 1, which started only two years after his publication. In addition to this is
the fact that the chemical industry used to source feedstocks largely from coal tar [5] as well
as the rapid rise of petroleum-based feedstocks and the growth of the petrochemical industry,
and more prosaically the engineering difficulties of implementing any sort of photochemistry
at scale. This close alliance of chemistry and engineering has been recognized in recent years,
particularly with the development of 12 Principles of Green Engineering to complement those
of green chemistry [6]. The synergy between green chemistry and engineering has been further
reinforced by the ACS Green Chemistry Institute which has published a pamphlet on ‘Design
Principles for Sustainable & Green Chemistry & Engineering’ [7], particularly emphasizing the
need for a more holistic systems approach to the whole problem of supplying chemicals in the
future.
