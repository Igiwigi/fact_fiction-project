Actual results,
however, show that in no part of the range of polytes is the cyrus 2 more common, and
it can only be supposed that selection due to mimicry is effective, if it has come into
action very recently among a population which consisted in the main of the cyrus
form. This is improbable and is not supported by any evidence whatever. Statistics as to the relative abundance of the three 2s at Peradeniya were obtained
by collecting wild larvee, and, since these were only found singly or in small numbers
throughout the whole period of the experiments, it follows that almost every
individual was the offspring of a different 2; it is probable, therefore, that the
results obtained are fairly accurate, in spite of the fact that the total number recorded
was small, Further, since polytes is one of the most migratory of species, statistics
obtained in the Peradeniya district apply almost equally to the whole of the island. The total number of individuals reared from wild larvee was 155, among which
there were 66 fs, 40 2 cyrus, 24 2 romulus, and 25 2 polytes; the numbers of the
various ?s converted into percentages read as 2 cyrus 45 per cent, (44°94...),
3 romulus 27 per cent. (26°96...), % polytes 28 per cent.
