emergence which has in the mean while been diminishing, and at length the
spherical error produced by them will recover its original proportion to the
opposite error of the curye of correction. When f has reached this point f",
(at which the angle of incidence does not exceed that of emergence s0 much
as it had at first come short of it,) the rays again pass the glass free from
spherical aberration.

If f be carried from hence towards the glass, or outwards from its original
place, the angle of incidence in the former case, or of emergence in the latter,
becomes disproportionately effective ; and either way the aberration exceeds
the correction.

These facts have been established by careful experiment : they accord with
every appearance in such combinations of the plano-conyex glasses as have
come under my notice, and may I believe be extended to this rule ;â€”that in
general an achromatic object-glass, of which the inner surfaces are in contact,
or nearly 80, will have on one side of it two foci in its axis, for the rays
proceeding from which it will be truly corrected at a moderate aperture ; that
for the space between these two points, its spherical aberration will be over-
corrected, and beyond them either way under-corrected.

I am not aware that an exception is to be made for any
quality of glass or curves that are likely to be used for the
microscope : but I apprehend a case may occur, if the flint
glass is convexo-concave and the convex lens united to its
