290 PROFESSOR MATTEUCCI'S ELECTRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCHES.

The experiment consists in this: that after fifteen or twenty minutes of the passage
of the current, that limb only which is traversed by the inverse current, that is to
say, in a direction contrary to the ramification of the nerve, contracts at the opening
of the circuit.

When the frog is reduced to this state, if the nerye traversed by the inverse cur-
rent is touched by a small portion of muscle, we see the limb instantly contract
as if the circuit bad been interrupted ; and in fact the current ceases to pass through
the nerve and enters the muscle on account of the greater conductibility of the latter
substance.

I $hall cite another experiment of the same kind. Having succeeded in modi-
fying the excitability of the nerve by the passage of the current, as in the expe-
riment just described, we can easily convince ourselyes that this modification is
confined to the exposed or isolated portion of the nerves. For if those portions of
the nerves in both thighs, which had been previously buried in the museles, be
now laid bare, no alteration in their excitability is found to have occurred ; but the
altered excitability is limited to the pelvic portions of the nerves previously exposed
and traversed by the current. It is evident that if the nerve, buried among the
muscles of the thigh, were traversed by the current as its exposed portion above is,
