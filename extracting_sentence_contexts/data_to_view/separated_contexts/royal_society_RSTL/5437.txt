MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 435
We find as the equation of the locus,
(1-10) (+4 +2Y*+61(1—30P—167)(a*+5* +2) xyz
+6P(1—104P— 320)a%*2?
—2(1+8ÞY(yo+22%+2%)=0,

where the function on the left-hand side is the octicovariant ©,U of my Third Memoir. the covariant having been in fact defined 80 as to satisfy the condition in question. And I have given in the memoir the following expression for ©, U, viz. ©,U=(1—16P—67)U*
