Considering the streamwise variance profiles in inner scaling (figure 5a), the profiles
from the X-wire measurements in both the streamwise/spanwise and streamwise /wall-normal
configurations agree exceptionally well with each other and are in agreement with the single-
wire measurements, except for the lowest Reynolds number. This discrepancy might be related to
difficulties in the calibration at low velocities, say mean velocities below 5m s~!, in which case the
calibration needs to be accurate down to nearly 1 ms-! [55], which could not be ensured for the
in situ calibration of the boundary-layer probes. Although the streamwise variance profile exhibits
a mild second peak, the fact that the wire length in inner units L* increases up to 40 and 80 viscous
units for the boundary-layer and Dantec probes, respectively, excludes the possibility of drawing
any firm conclusions regarding this. By utilizing the spatial resolution correction outlined in [28],
it was found that the entire range covered by the X-wire measurements is virtually free of spatial
resolution effects. The near-wall data from the single wires, on the other hand, are affected and
the results from the correction scheme are shown in figure 5a as grey symbols.
