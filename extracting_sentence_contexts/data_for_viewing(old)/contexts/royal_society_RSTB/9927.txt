p= 1x 107, wp =2 x 10’ and o=1 x 10*. If the true ages
are T=, and 7 =, and the mean of the rate prior is
equal to the true substitution rate, r= 107°, then the posterior
of 7, is as shown in figure 3. If the calibration prior for 7; is
instead grossly incorrect with true 7, = 1.5 x 10°” the result-
ing posterior is shown in figure 3. In this case, the incorrect
calibration prior leads to a posterior that is apparently very
precise but grossly incorrect.

5. Concluding remarks

The species divergence time inference problem has unusual
statistical properties owing to the fact that the two distinct
sources of data (sequence and fossil calibrations) will only
lead to an identifiable model when used in combination. Cor-
rect assignment of fossils to ancestral lineages appears
critical. Incorrect fossil assignments can result in posterior
densities that are highly inaccurate, yet appear very precise.
The specification of the prior on calibrations should also
be done with care as the combination of marginal fossil
calibrations with rank order constraints of phylogenetic
trees can cause a change in the prior that may reduce the
apparent uncertainty of divergence time estimates. This can
be checked by running an MCMC program using a fixed
