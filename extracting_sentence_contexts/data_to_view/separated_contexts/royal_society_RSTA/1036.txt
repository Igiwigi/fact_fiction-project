As 6 decreases towards 1, AÂ¢r approaches Apiot. For values of f infinitesimally
above 1, a finite wavenumber k ~ 0.941 is selected, but at 6 = 1, all wavenumbers are possible. For
B <1, we see the reappearance of a critical point, but it is in fact a local minimum rather than a
local maximum. Hence, surface instability appears first for all values of 6 <1. For large values of f corresponding to a stiff film on a soft substrate, the selected wavenumber
becomes vanishingly small and the critical compression ratio on an infinite domain approaches
1, corresponding to the Euler buckling instability.
