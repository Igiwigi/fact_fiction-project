The projection
operators corresponding to different outcomes of the same measurement satisfy

where I is the identity operator. If x and x are compatible measurements, then

where [...] denotes the commutator.
(II) The probability of obtaining {a;} when measuring {x} on state w satisfies |(W'|W)
where |’) is given by equation (2.6).

Remarkably, the characterization of the quantum behaviours is similar for Bell scenarios
(in which we do not assume that measurements are ideal) and for KS scenarios (in which all
measurements are ideal by definition). This reflects the fact that any quantum behaviour for a
Bell scenario can be attained with ideal measurements. This follows from Neumark’s (also named
Naimark’s) dilation theorem [30-34] that states that every generalized measurement in quantum
theory (represented by a positive-operator valued measure (POVM)) can be implemented as an
ideal quantum measurement (represented by a projection-valued measure (PVM)) on a larger
Hilbert space. In a Bell scenario, any local POVM x admits a local dilation to a PVM that is
common to every context in which x appears.
