As the range is lessened, careful measurement reveals that the time of rise of the pressure-
time wave becomes less also, due to increase in shock-wave speed across the gauge diameter. The records show that the profile of the pressure-time wave spreads with propagation,
and therefore the duration and time-constant increases with increase in range. This results
from the fact that the velocity of propagation of the shock-wave depends upon its pressure

amplitude and the large-amplitude front part of the wave travelling faster than its rear,
forces the wave to spread. This is largely confirmed by the work of other experimenters
except in cases where the charges have been too small to make measurements reliable
(Arons & Smith 1946; Coles, Christian, Slifko, Niffenegger & Rogers 1946; Osborne &
Taylor 1944, 1946; Cole & Coles 1947). The results are in accord also with theory (Kirk-
wood & Bethe 1942; Cole 1948; Osborne & Taylor 1944, 1946; Cole & Coles 1947; Kirk-
wood & Montroll 1942; Kirkwood & Richardson 1942; Kirkwood, Montroll & Richardson
