There is,
as well, evidence of a functional hierarchy within the colour
system, extending from V1 to V4 [44-47], with the responses
of cells in V4 approximating more closely to constant colours
and to specific hues than those in V1 and V2. Among the
most impressive evidence in favour of a functional hierarchy
is the one provided by the motion system [48,49], which
shows that the cells of V1 projecting to V5 respond to the direc-
tion of motion of the components of a visual stimulus, whereas
those in V5 commonly respond to its true, global direction of
motion. This no doubt reflects the fact that the connections
from V1 to V5 are highly convergent [50], although this conver-
gent input, which operates to enlarge receptive fields, is rather
subtle, because critical computational elements that dis-
tinguish between local and global motion are undertaken
within subregions of the large receptive fields [51].

probably significantly different. At any rate, the two types of
binding should be distinguished, perhaps by referring
specifically to inter- and intra-attribute binding. Perceptual asynchrony creates a problem for understanding
how the visual brain operates, no matter what strategy one
believes in.
