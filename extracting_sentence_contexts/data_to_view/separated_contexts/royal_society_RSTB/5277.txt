[6, p. 310], “ We see here the spot
where the corals did not grow, as at Headington we saw where they did. Here we have
the débris of the ground-up, variably hardened reef, along with the Echinoderms that
lived in the neighbourhood.” In fact, of that part of BLake and HupiEston’s paper
devoted to our area, it is the pages dealing with these higher beds near Oxford that
are the most valuable, and I shall often quote from them in the following account. Carried out with this idea in mind, the detailed investigation of all the present sections
has led, not to increased complexity, but to remarkable simplification. It has produced
the conviction that the recent attempts at complicated interpretations of these rocks
are without foundation and misleading.
