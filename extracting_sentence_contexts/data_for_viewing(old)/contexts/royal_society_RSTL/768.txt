It is moreover well known, that there is a strong affinity
between potash and the oxide of. platina, and also that when
those suhstances are brought together in solution, a-triple salt,
but little soluble, is the result. It was to avoid: these difficulties
thatT had employed uncombinedsulphuretted hydrogen gas; for
the method adopted by Mess. Rost and GEnLEn appearing tome
to be the application of two divellent forces, I presumed-that it
would produce a separation. The result of their experiment,
which, it appears from their paper, they had not anticipated,
shews the necessity of the precaution I had used. The opera-
tion which they performed to unite platina and mercury was,
in fact, nearly the reverse of that which they supposed they
had repeated from me, and might have been applied perhaps
with a better prospect of success towards the decomposition of
palladium.

Mess. Rost and GEHLEN seem, in many parts of their paper,
to question my having fused platina; and inform us that
although they had exposed this metal in the furnace of the


Plalina and Mercury upon each other. 109
