has « (s, ¢) for its sum-function. It was shown in §27 that the convergence of this
series is absolute, and, by an application of Drnt's theorem, it may be shown that the
convergence is also uniform in the square a=sSb, a=t=b. Hence, if (s),

replacing « (s, t) by the series (27) in (19), we obtain
