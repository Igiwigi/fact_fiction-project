4mm. on photographic print approx. equals 7 min. of arc. The obvious advantage of a method such as this, which depends only on the position of a
point relative to two lines in its very close neighbourhood, is that no precision apparatus is
required. In fact, the film was held in a light-tight envelope, by a retort stand placed at
about 1 m. from the crystal. The exactness of the distance does not matter, nor does the
exact orientation of the film relative to the crystal axes and anticathqde surface, as long as
the 220 Cu Ka, and a, lines are well resolved. Their actual separation on the photograph
before enlargement was 2 mm.
