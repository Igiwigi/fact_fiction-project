on the occipital surface, ends in a ridge, separated from an exactly similar
ridge of the pterygoid by the quadrate.


48 MR. D, M. S. WATSON ON THE STRUCTURE,

3. The downturning of the lateral wings of the pterygoids inside the basi-
temporal fosse, so that the palate forms a broad U-shaped channel.

4, The unusual way in which the posterior edge of the pterygoid is applied to
the flat inner face of the quadrate.

5. The fact that the occipital condyles lie far behind the dermosupra-occipitals,
so that the occipital surface slopes forwards.

The genera even resemble one another in such little features as the general shape
of the suture between the parasphenoid and pterygoid.

The whole family seems to have been descended from the Upper Permian type
Dwinasaurus, found by Prof. Amauirzk1 on the Dwina. I have not found any
description of this animal, and only know it by certain photographs and casts
presented by its discoverer to the British Museum. I do not therefore feel entitled
to give a description of it, but, on account of its great importance, give here a few
notes on its relations.
