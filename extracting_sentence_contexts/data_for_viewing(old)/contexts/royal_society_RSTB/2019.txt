been heated to 99° C., for five minutes. The plates were prepared on October 22nd
at 3.30 p.m., and kept at the ordinary temperature of the laboratory (15°-20° C.) ;
examined at 2.30 p.m. on October 24th, Plate A in each series showed a few pin-
point whitish colonies, which by the following day at noon appeared as pearly,
translucent drops upon the surface of the gelatine in Plates A-C. In none of the
plates were these colonies abundant, but the plates, owing to the acidity of the
medium, showed no admixture of other forms, and these cultures remained pure for the
full six weeks during which they were under observation. It was evident, therefore,
that here was a bacterial organism which could be isolated from moulds by the
simple method of heating the soil, and from the numerous other bacterial organisms
found in the soil, by the use of acid media. The fact was also interesting that it
grew luxuriantly on saccharine gelatine, but, as later experience proved, not on
gelatine or agar containing no sugar or peptone. These facts were sufficient to arrest
attention and to make a further study of the organism comparatively simple.

As noted above, the colonies on saccharose-gelatine plates occur in the form of large
drops, 1-2 millims. in diameter, at the end of 3 days, and rising about 0°5 millim. above
the surface, of a greyish-white colour to the naked eye, and yellowish or tawny under
a §-in. objective, translucent and with a pearly lustre (Plate 14, fig. 2). In texture
they are gelatinous and stringy and do not, at first, separate bodily from the
gelatine. Later, however, in the course of a week, small colonies come away intact
on a platinum needle, indicating a very slow liquefaction of the gelatine immediately
beneath the colony. Eventually each colony comes to lie in a shallow pool of liquefied
gelatine, while at the same time it gradually loses its well-defined contour, firm
consistency, and drop-like form, and appears as a whitish flocculent mass in the
