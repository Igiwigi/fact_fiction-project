hibit comparatively a low range, in fact the month of July has the lowest mean di
urnal oscillation in each year; and it may be broadly stated, that with two or three
exceptions the monthly mean diurnal oscillation increases from July to December or
January, and deereases from these months to July, How far the monthly mean oscil-
lations of the barometer and the monthly mean range of the thermometer coincide,
will be seen by the following Table. The monthly mean temperature and the monthly
mean diurnal oscillations of the barometer have little coincidence.
