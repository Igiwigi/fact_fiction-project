This bipartite genome organization, differentiated by slow
and fast evolving regions, has led to the ‘two-speed’ genome
model, where gene-sparse repeat-rich compartments serve as
a cradle for adaptive evolution, underpinning infection success
by enabling the pathogen to rapidly overcome host resistance,
evolve new virulence determinants and even jump to new host
species [22]. Another interesting aspect about oomycete gen-
omes is that they exhibit variations in ploidy and can exist as
either triploids or polyploids [23-25]. The relevance of this fea-
ture is currently not fully understood, however, polyploidy has
been shown to enhance vigour and buffer mutational changes
by masking deleterious alleles [26], and is therefore believed to
play a vital role in pathogen success. In fact, many successful P.
infestans clonal lineages are made up of triploid genotypes [26].

Here, we discuss seven oomycetes that are emerging or
re-emerging threats to world agriculture, horticulture, aquacul-
ture and natural ecosystems. They were selected based on their
impact on economy and society, and include both well-known
and understudied pathogens of both plants and animals. For
each pathogen, we describe its pathology, importance and
impact, discuss why it is an emerging threat and briefly
review research activities that underpin effective disease
management strategies. Table 1 summarizes our current knowl-
edge of the genome and secreted proteins of the examined
