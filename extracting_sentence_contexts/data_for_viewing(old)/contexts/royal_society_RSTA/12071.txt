q = the observed intensity of radiation,
a = the intensity of radiation on unit surface outside the limits of the atmos-
phere,
b =a “constant,” which is the fraction showing the amount of absorption for a
body in the zenith ; 2.¢., the “absorption co-efficient,”
and
e = the thickness of the atmosphere, the value being taken as unity for a
body in the zenith. € is approximately equal to sec. ZD. up to a zenith-
distance of 60° or 65°.

Tn the case of the sun, @ is the solar constant. One of the mistakes made by the
older experimenters was that of assuming the quantity b to be really a constant,
which it is not. It is, in fact, a function of two variables, viz., the wave-length of
the radiation, and ¢, the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the radiation.
(LANGLEY, in commenting on this fact, seems to have overlooked Rosrri’s work, in
which the increase of b with ¢ is clearly and quantitatively stated.)

From the results of his work, LANGLEY obtains 41 per cent. as a probable approxi-
mation to the absorption of total radiation for a body in the zenith. His argument
may be briefly summarized thus:

The number of wave-lengths in a composite radiation is infinite. Each wave-
length may have its own individual coefficient of absorption. The coefficients of
absorption will be infinite in number and will vary in value between 0 and unity.
