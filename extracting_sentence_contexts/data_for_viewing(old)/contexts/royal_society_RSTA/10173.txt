Reviewing now the results obtained with the five surfaces as a whole, it is clear
that the rate of steam formation is governed neither by the “ order” of the reaction,
as BoDENSTEIN asserted, nor by diffusion factors simply, as Nernst has suggested.
Nor is the theory of a rapidly alternating series of oxidations and reductions of
the catalysing surface admissible. The evidence is, on the contrary, altogether
in favour of the view that the catalytic action of porcelain is primarily due to the
condensation, or occlusion, of one, and possibly both, of the reacting gases on its
surface. The fact that whenever one or other of the gases is present in excess, the
rate of combination is proportional to the partial pressure of the hydrogen, and that
the material absorbs hydrogen at red heat, indicates that occluded hydrogen is an all
important factor in the process. It would also seem, from the results obtained with
surfaces C and E, that occluded oxygen also may exercise an accelerating influence
on the process; otherwise it is difficult to account for the fact that in several of the
experiments with an excess of oxygen a surface proved more than normally active,
and that surface E, before it had been subjected to the treatment with hydrogen at
red heat, could be stimulated by previous exposure to oxygen at 450°. Another
significant circumstance is that, whilst excess of hydrogen always produced a
continuous acceleration throughout a given experiment, any acceleration due to an
