We shall write c? for uv? + v? + w*, and it will frequently be necessary, for the
sake of brevity, to denote all co-ordinates of the same type by a single representative
letter without a suffix.
_ Thus t(p) = f (Pr Pas + + Px)

412° MR. J. H. JEANS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR ENERGY.

We shall assume that these co-ordinates are principal co-ordinates of the system, so
that-both the kinetic and potential energies will be the sums of squares. We may,
in fact, write

WV = 67, + ore +... oF ore
2T = me? + 2Q + 28S

where

2Q = big? + bog +... + DiQn?

We shall suppose the oscillations of the 7, s co-ordinates to be so small as to be
isochronous, and in this case the ¢ and d coefficients will be constants. Since the r
co-ordinates are to be very small, the “ configuration ” of a molecule may be supposed
