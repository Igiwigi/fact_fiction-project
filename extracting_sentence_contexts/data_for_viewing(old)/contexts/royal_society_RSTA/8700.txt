necessary to use Lord Rayiercu’s exact formule, equivalent to (4°7) above, and to
go as far as n = 4 in the series.§

§6. Case or Larce Perrecriy Conpuctine SPHERES.

Before proceeding to the final formule, it will be convenient to state certain results
given by Macponaxp|| for the values of the functions §, (z), E,(z), when both » and
z are large.

* For the case in which K —1 is small this conclusion is given by G. W. WALKER, ‘Quarterly Journal
of Mathematics,’ vol. 30, 1899, p. 217. The formule given on that page agree with (5-6), when K — 1 is
small; but the more general formule on the preceding page do not agree with (5-6) completely. I have
not succeeded in tracing the discrepancy on account of the fact that G. W. WALKER has omitted some of
the details of his preliminary calculations.

{ To obtain an accuracy of 1 per cent. in S,(z) by retaining two terms of the series only, it must be
supposed that |z| does not exceed 1-3.

|| ‘Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 210, A, 1910, p. 134: the formule are due to L. Lorenz originally. A very
interesting method of deriving the results is given by Desyx (‘ Math. Annalen,’ Bd. 67, 1909, p. 535).
