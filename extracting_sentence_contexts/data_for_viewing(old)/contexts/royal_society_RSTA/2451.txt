involves electromagnetic torques between the plasma and vessel wall that influences the flow
evolution.

The closer one positions the plasma to the operating limits, the more likely a disruption will be.
Disruption avoidance strategies are being explored, but avoiding them altogether is a challenge
wherever one chooses the operating point. The consequences are serious and constitute the main
threat to the structural integrity of the tokamak—terminal failure of the device is a very real
possibility if appropriate safeguards are not taken. First, the loss of control of the plasma during
a disruption results in a high interaction with the wall, with extreme thermal loads that can cause
melting. Second, a large fraction of the plasma current, several MA in the largest tokamaks, will
flow through the vessel components as so-called halo currents. Given the Tesla-level fields that
exist in the tokamak, this imparts huge forces on the vessel components and structure which
the tokamak has to be designed to withstand. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that these
currents do not flow uniformly, and their distribution may be related to the details of the nonlinear
plasma structures associated with the MHD instability that led to the disruption. This makes it
difficult to quantify the magnitude of the forces, but also the directions in which they will act.


The third challenge is that very high electric fields can form in the plasma during a disruption | 10 |
which will accelerate electrons to very high energy—so-called runaway electrons that can rapidly

multiply via an avalanching effect. These can cause very serious damage to the tokamak structure 3
if not mitigated. oS

The most robust mitigation strategies revolve around sensing when a disruption is imminent : gS
