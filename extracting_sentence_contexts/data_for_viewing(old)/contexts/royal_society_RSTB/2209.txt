by inflation of the lung.) This failure occurs whilst an irregular, and in the main
falling, blood pressure obtains, and the remnant of cardiac energy soon disappears if
sartificial respiration is withheld. The phrenic nerve responds to electrical stimulation
after death.

s (As a result of employing oxygen inhalations, it has been found that the respiratory
scentre is more rapidly aroused than when atmospheric air alone is used. Irregularity
sof the heart does not seem to be modified by oxygen, though the ventricle seems to

Summary.

These facts point to the lethal effect of aconitine upon cats, guinea-pigs, and rabbits
s being primarily due to respiratory failure, which is in agreement with the conclusions
of Hartey,* Mackenzis,t and Murray.t

2 It has been more than once stated how closely circulatory failure, which Boum and
2 WARTMANYS regard as primary, follows respiratory arrest. Artificial respiration, if
s begun sufficiently early, prolongs life, though not to the extent alleged by Lewrn.||
The primary increase in respiration after aconitine may arise from stimulation of
medullary centres, as well as of the sensory endings of the vagi in the lungs, for it
Appears to some extent if vagotomy has been performed. A subsequent depression is
produced at both points, the centres remaining, however, sensitive to a certain extent
to the stimulation of venous blood, whilst their paralysis may be postponed for a
