restricted to a very few cases, as it is obviously not easy to find solutions suitable in
all respects.*

* WuetiHAm’s determination of the velocity of the copper ion, and his comparison of the results with
the calculated number, are open to the objection that what he observed was not the copper ion at all, but


PROFESSOR O. MASSON ON IONIC VELOCITIES. 335
New Method of Observing Ionic Velocities.

This method resembles Lopar’s, in so far as it makes use of electrolytic jellies and
of visible moving boundaries, but differs from his in its essential principle, as will be
explained, and also in the fact that it seeks to avoid such sources of error as change
of temperature, the use of mixtures of unknown composition, and the introduction of
indicators that react with the ions under observation. The use of gelatine necessarily
introduces a small amount of electrolytic impurity which must have some disturbing
effect; but the solid gelatine used in making the jellies contains less than “5 per cent.

Sof its weight of mineral matter, and a plain 12 per cent. jelly was found to have a
‘gonductivity so small as to be practically negligible in comparison with those of the
‘Balt jellies used for experiment. That this is so is shown by the results obtained ;
Sut the fact that the best available gelatine has some conductivity of its own would
Antroduce a real difficulty in any attempt to apply the method to solutions of small
