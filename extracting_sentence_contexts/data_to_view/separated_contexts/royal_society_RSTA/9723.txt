Dorn’s suggestion,
in order to determine f in the formula 3 = fuC,, taking the value of « from
TANziER's experiments (which will be discussed in the next section) on the viscosity
of mixtures of argon and helium. He found that f so determined for the mixture ”
was greater than §, approaching a maximum (about 4) when there was 60 per cent.
of helium in the gas, and falling to 3, as Scawarze showed, when either gas was
eliminated. This fact is interesting, but, in the absence of any explanatory theory,
does not lead to anything further. Wacnsmvuts also found that the observations could be represented to within 2 per
cent. or 3 per cent. by the formula

x +
ty = 1+Ap’/p ie Bp/p’

(modelled on a similar formula for the viscosity of gases which we shall consider
presently). As there were only four observations and two empirical constants the
fact is not very remarkable; when p = 0 of course 3,, = 9’, and when p’ = 0 we have
3. =.
