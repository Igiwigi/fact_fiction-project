eggs which are destined to be impregnated in the ordinary manner, or indeed in any
insect eggs, while, on the contrary, I have found it to be very large in all the eggs of
Crustacea which have come under my notice.

Parthenogenesis in the Articulata.

From the hardness of the outer skin, and from the finality in the mode of growth,
parthenogenesis in the Articulata is effected by means of bodies in their origin and
structure very similar to true eggs.

'The Crustacea are 80 seldom bred and watched in captivity, that though the Daphniade
is the only family in the class which is as yet known to reproduce by parthenogenesis,
yet the instances may hereafter prove to be much more frequent, as the fact that no
males have yet been found of Polyphemus oculus, Limnadia gigas or Apus would seem to
Suggest.

Similar phenomena have been recorded by DUMERIL®, and more recently by NEwMan+Þ.

In the Insects, excepting the celebrated case of the Aphides and the genera Cynips
and Apophyltus, as stated by HarmiG4, whose assertions have been confirmed by the
appearance of Cynips lignicola in great numbers in the south-west of England within
the last year or two, where in several thousand specimens not a male occurred ;—with
these exceptions, I say, the phenomenon of parthenogenesis has as yet only been met
with in the Lepidoptera, probably because this is the order most frequently bred by
collectors.
