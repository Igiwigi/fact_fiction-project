u=2(D%— 2" {a (ki +kE®)}. The latter form is simply the series before found in the solution of (8.) without the
factor z””. In fact the solution of (8.) is the type of the solution of (7.), when there
is no second term P; for if vu= is a solution of (8.), v=(z)"'u is the solution of

The suppression of the terms containing þ does not materially impair the generality
of the form ; for it is well known, and follows immediately from (1.), that

e(D+3)u="Fp(D)(6u). I have found the most convenient form of (7.) to be
