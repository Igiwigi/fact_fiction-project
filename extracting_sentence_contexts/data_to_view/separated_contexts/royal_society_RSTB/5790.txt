It is probable that it is only superficially confluent with the sulcus limitans
precunei. The grounds for this view are (a) the lack of development of the upper
part of the preecuneus, (b) the simplicity of pattern of the sulci of the precuneus, (c) the
identification of the sulci in the cuneus as the incisura parieto-occipitalis, the sulcus
paracalcarinus and the sulcus limitans ares striate, superioris. The small posterior
arm of what appears to be the fissura parieto-occipitalis is, if the above facts are valid,
the upper end of the suleus limitans precunei. A series of Australian brains shows
some which are very similar to this in which the operculum anterior fosse parieto-
occipitalis is only developed in its lower half. In higher forms the increased operculation
leads to the covering of the incisura parieto-occipitalis and the sulcus paracalcarinus
(21p) together with the arcus intercuneatus.
