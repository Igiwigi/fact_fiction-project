Vertebre. The hundred and sixty-one vertebre contained in the collection, few of which pre-
serve all their processes in a perfect state, form a subject of no small perplexity, and it is
beyond our power to determine precisely the number which the skeleton contained. On the presumption that Pezophaps possessed the same number of dorsal (8) and cer-
vical (12) vertebre as is assigned to Didus by Professor Owsx's draughtsman *, there
is 8uch a great numerical preponderance of specimens of the eighth, ninth, and tenth
cervicals (Plate XV. figs. 24-34), counting backwards, that one is at first led to suppose
that Pezophaps must have been endowed with more, till a diligent study of each example
compels the belief that no other presumption will meet the case equally well, and an
explanation of the curious fact that the specimens of each of these three vertebre are
nearly twice as numerous as most of those of the rest must be sought elsewhere. And
in support of this view it may be stated that of the three anchylosed dorsal yertcbre
there are present in the collection but five examples. The penultimate free dorsal (Plate XV. figs. 56-59) interyening between that which
coalesces with the pelvis and the threeF anchylosed vertebre jus: mentioned, is repre-
sented in the collection by nine specimens, none of which is entirely perfect.
