This does not seem at all improbable. It could scarcely, however, be supposed
that the effect produced on the earth's magnetisxm could be due to the given solar
meridian being presented to (that is, in the same plane with) the earth, unless we admit
the idea that these solar magnetic actions are propagated only in certain definite
directions, or that the earth has some action in the production of the solar change when
the given meridian is presented to it. In order to examine the facts, all the cases were noted during the years 1844 and
1845 in which the daily mean horizontal force diminished one thousandth of its whole
value within an interval of three days; they were found to be twenty-eight in number. If we call the solar meridian presented to us on the 1st January, 1844, the zero meridian
{9), and consider the time of rotation to be 26 days, and that there are 26 meridians,
we find that the solar meridians presented to us when these great moyements occurred
may be arranged in a few groups, as in the following Table. *
