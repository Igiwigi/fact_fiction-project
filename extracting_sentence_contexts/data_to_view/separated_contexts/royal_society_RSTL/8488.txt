pp. 120,
123), to question the soundness of Havrer's theory of the trade-winds, Theso are, that winds do not blow
centripetally toward the Sahara, the Arabian Desert, the interior of Australia, &c., all of them dry regions with
a day temperature yery much aboye that of the neighbouring seas. In the first place Mr. Lavenzox has, |
think, insufficiently considered the fact that a high day temperature in these dry regions generally alternat
with a low night temperature, the nocturnal radiation þeing intensified by the same conditions which
increase the incident solar heat; 80 that the mean temperature of the 24 hours, one element of importance

in determining the general system of the winds in such regions, is frequently below that of places with a m
lower day temperature. £xz. gr., Lahore in April has a mean maximum diurnal temperature of 98%4,
one of 93%5; but the mean temperature of the 24 hours is only 791 at Lahore, while at Calcutta it is 849,
Further, the facts discussed in the text and tabulated at pages 589, 608, 609, show that in a dry atmosph of
paratively dry air, say 7000 feet in height, may have an average temperature 16?
