What about if there is a boundary to the space-time, such as in AdS space? Here the radiation :
could travel all the way to the boundary and return in a finite time, so we have to worry about =
any returning radiation which is no longer well separated. In fact, there is a simple accounting 3
(or relabelling) trick that allows us to handle this straightforwardly. To see what this relabelling [8
involves let us first recall that Levy’s lemma constrains the correlations in a very general way: In :
particular, the order in which subsystems are ‘sampled’ is irrelevant, only the dimensionalities DA
of the identified subsystems play a role. This means that we can simply redefine R (figure 1) Dw
as that radiation from an earlier epoch that remains well separated from the black hole and its :2
surrounding neighbourhood at the epoch of interest.
