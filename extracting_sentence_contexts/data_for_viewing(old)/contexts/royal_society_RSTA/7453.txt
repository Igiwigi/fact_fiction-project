is as great as 10~4 times the amplitude of the gravity waves (ocean waves) so generated. The
weakness of this argument is apparent. Ocean waves are not generated by oscillating pressure
distributions of the type described by Scholte, but more probably by a systematic difference
of pressure between the front and rear slopes of the crests of a wave train (Jeffreys 1925).
The effect of a pressure distribution of this latter type, while tending continually to increase
the energy of the gravity waves, would tend to cancel out for the much longer waves of
compression.

An earlier theory, due originally to Wiechert and until recently strongly supported by
Gutenberg, was that microseisms are caused by the impact of waves breaking against a steep
coast. It is argued in favour of this theory that there is a statistical correlation between, for
example, the amplitude of the microseisms at Hamburg and the height of the waves off the
coast of Norway (â€˜Tams 1933). This theory will account for some of the facts, although it

involves a coefficient for the proportion of the wave energy imparted to the ground which
some may consider too high (Bradford 1935). Observations also seem to show that micro-
seisms associated with storms at sea may be recorded several hours before the waves reach
the coast (Banerji 1930; Ramirez 1940; Deacon 1949), so that a further explanation, at any
rate of these latter observations, is required.

Possibly the most natural explanation of microseisms, and one that might have been
previously considered more seriously but for theoretical objections, is that they are generated
