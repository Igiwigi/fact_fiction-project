and therefore of the right order with 3 = 361°89w”.
Mannine’s new lines suggest, on a superficial glance, a series of bands, but there

can be little doubt of their connection with the Diffuse series. Their relations to one
another can be discussed either on the basis of the old D() or of (73)D(). With

4260°05 as D,, (intensity 10) goes 4241°25 as D,, (intensity 9). D,,—112°15 should
give D,, = 4261°53. This has not been observed, but it is D,,(1)(—13d). In fact,
the error between this calculated value and that deduced from D,, is only
d\ = 02, and a satellite difference of 183 is more in accordance with that of
other elements than the small one of 143, in the accepted series. Amongst the other
lines are the collaterals 4280°4 (intensity 9) = (A) (4260) with O-—C = —-04, and
4363°7 (intensity 2) = (5A) (4260) with 0—C = ‘1.

As in the case of Al, so In shows an increase of satellite differences with the order.
The first three, 53, 263, 263 may be considered as certain, but the next, 32d, although
it is close to the observation, may, as in the case of aluminium, be the same as the
others (263) within error limits, owing to the large error in D,. K.R. gives the
