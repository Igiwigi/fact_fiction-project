BRINKLEY's observations for investigating

before. Had 204” been used for the” constant of aberration,
the result would have been only less by half a second- than
before. In fact, the quantity of discordance does not- differ from
what I had before observed, but part of 'it now appears to
arise from the constant of aberration» being greater z'/a con=
clusion that will be deemed very important, should it be con-
firmed by future observations or other instruments. © The
parallax of Arcturus is 80mewhat less than before; and thatof
» Cygni considerably less. yy Draconis; as before, exhibits no
parallax; the small negative result. of -$ of a second may
safely be referred to the unavoidable errors of observation:
The new results agree with the former, in 'showing-that-the
Pole Star has no sensible parallax:

With respect to the constant'of aberration, it is almost un-
necessary to remark its important bearing on 'the theory of
light. Should a decided difference in the quantity of that
constant, for two stars, be established, it would be decisive
against the  undulatory system; and it would' also -show,
that the corpuscular theory could not, without the addition
of principles at present unknown, explain the phenomena
of light. I trust the results here obtained will 'be found
to possess some interest, and may induce others to/pursue
the same object.
