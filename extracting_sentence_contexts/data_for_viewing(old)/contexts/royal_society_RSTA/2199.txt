to a potential minimum inside the vibrating patch.

6. Ponderomotive magnetism

Most problems addressed so far were special cases of the Newtonian system
x= —-VV(x,t).

It turns out that if, unlike in prior sections, VV exhibits some rotation in time (for fixed x and as a
function of f), then a new effect arises. This section summarizes some results from [26].

(a) Some background

It is a fundamental fact of nature that a changing electric field creates a magnetic field.
Interestingly, a superficially analogous effect arises in mechanics: in a rapidly changing force field
a particle acts as if it were subject to Lorentz force. This happens, for example, when a point
mass is placed in the rapidly rotating saddle potential [27]. The ponderomotive Lorentz force, a term
introduced in [26], seems to be a fitting name for this magnetic-like force, since it is given by
the same mathematical expression as the Lorentz force (where the ‘magnetic field’ is given in
