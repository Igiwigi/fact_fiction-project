This theory I shall apply here, not to the ordinary finite solution, but to the solution
by definite integrals of the differential equation (I). In doing this I shall give to U and
V the particular values 0. We are justified in doing this by the canons relating to the
arbitrary constants which are laid down in the memoir ; but it will suffice here to direct
attention to the fact that while the processes employed are strictly speaking particular,
they lead to a solution involving the requisite number of arbitrary constants, and at
the same time of the proper form, as manifested by the snecession of the indices in its
development. Giving then to (T) the form

p #(D)_ e(D)p(D—n)p(D—2n).. ad inf.
