It is difficult to give intelligible names to sensations of a
new and uncommon kind. That, which this lady denomi-
nated numbness, diminished neither the motion nor the sen-
sibility of the parts affected. It was more a perception of
tightness and constriction, in which the susceptibility of feel-
ing in the parts was in fact increased; and the skin of the ex-
tremities was $0 tender, that the cold air produced a sense of
uneasiness, the finest flannel or worsted felt disagreeably
coarse, and the attempt to stick a pin with her fingers caused
intolerable pain. In the month of September 180g, not long after the appli-
cation of the blisters, she experienced in certain parts of the
left arm and thigh, that sensation of twitching which is vul-
garly called the *« life blood,” and which soon extended itself
to the right side. Shortly afterwards, she began to perceive
an actual vibration or starting up of certain portions of the
flexor muscles of the fore-arm, and of the deltoid on the left
side; not £0, however, as to move the arm or hand.
