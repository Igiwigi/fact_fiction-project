1. Introduction

The term ‘statistical learning’ was initially used to describe the fact that infants are
sensitive to the probability with which syllables co-occur, and can use this prop-
erty to segment words from fluent speech [1,2]. In this original set of experiments,
the probability of co-occurrence between syllables was described in terms of ‘tran-
sitional probability’, which is defined as the frequency with which syllables X and
Y co-occur, relative to the frequency with which X occurs. That is, if the syllable X
occurs 100 times, and the conjunction of XY occurs 80 times, the transitional prob-
ability between X and Y is 80%. These experiments demonstrated that infants
preferentially segment syllable groupings with high transitional probabilities
compared with syllable groupings with low transitional probabilities. The fact
that infants could use the statistical structure of the input to learn the identity
of words provided support to theoretical accounts suggesting that learning
plays an important role in language acquisition, and sparked tremendous interest
