Its application in
our case was most successful. If the black particles are dehydrated, embedded in
collodion, and cut, and the sections are then steeped in the Haw de Javelle for from
two to five minutes, or until gas bubbles begin to appear in them, it will be found that
the fungus has been rendered beautifully transparent, whilst remains of the original
animal tissue are still visible. In fact, within certain limits this re-agent has very
little action upon the animal tissue, and thus at once permits the study of the clarified
fungus in relation to its surroundings. It suffices for this purpose that a portion of
the tissue containing the black masses should be thoroughly dehydrated in absolute
alcohol, then transferred to ether, and subsequently to collodion. The collodion is
allowed to concentrate, and the impregnated mass is hardened in methylated chloro-
form, and cut.
