The number of months was too small to eliminate accidental features. This is
especially true of the character figures for reasons already stated.

The greater uncertainty of the character figures is borne out by the fact that while
the mean percentage value from the 3 months of largest sunspot frequency exceeded
the corresponding mean from the 3 months of least frequency in every single year in
the case of H ranges, the same phenomenon occurred in only 7 of the 11 years in the
case of character figures.

The 4 days retardation, shown in Tables V. and VII., would lead to some association
of sunspot frequency with magnetic phenomena in the following month, but even
the H range figures in Table XVIII. suggest more connection than this would
account for.
