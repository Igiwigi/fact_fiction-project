had invented the term “ myocomma” already in 1849 (namely, in his work “ On the Nature of Limbs”),
before Goopsir, in 1856, proposed the term “ myotome.”

In the essay “ On the Nature of Limbs,” however, only osteocomma, meaning a complete “ skeleton
segment,” but nothing approaching myocomma, is mentioned. In the same footnote, the terms osteomere, scleromere, and newromere are suggested as’ more appropriate
than Goopsi’s sclerotome and neurotome.
