The sinall Bast Indian Cyprinids which
are included iu the sub-group Homalopterina ure usually deseribed as entirely with-
out an air-bladder. They are said to be exclusively ground forms, with the ventral
surface of the body fattened for adhesion to stones at the bottom of the rapid Will
and mountain streams to which they are vestricted. The habits of these Fishes
would certainly lead us to expect that the airbladder would be rudimentary and
enclosed within bony capsules, but its complete suppression is unique so far as the
Ostariophysew are concerned, But in view of the fact that the yery existence of au
air-bladder has been denied in the case of several Siluroids which are now known to
possess at least a vestige of that organ, the statement that it is completely absent
in the Homalopterins cannot be necepted without further confirmation,

Vi.—Concioping Rawarks. The many and varied structural modifications met with in the air-bladder of the
Silurida are not surprising in view of the exceptionally diversified conditions under
which the different species and genera live. heir geographical distribution is almost
co-extensive with the tropical and subtropieal regions of the Earth's surface, and both
the habitat and habits of the different species are remarkably yaried.
