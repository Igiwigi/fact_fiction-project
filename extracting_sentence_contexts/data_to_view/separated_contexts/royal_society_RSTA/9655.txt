Ag. Unfortunately the D series in Silver is poorly developed—only the first satellite
has been observed, and the three chief lines after the first have very large possible
observation errors. Nothing, therefore, can be learnt as to the march of the satellite
differences beyond the fact that the observed —2436—is very close to 23d, = 2421. In the modified table ¢ = ‘1, the differences are very close as is seen to multiples of

6,, but there can be no certainty with such large possible errors.
