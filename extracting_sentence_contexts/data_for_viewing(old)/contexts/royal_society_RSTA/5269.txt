The left-hand side of (3.3) describes the slow dynamics of the moments of distribution in the
economy configuration variable x and time ft. This evolution is driven by the fast, local evolution
of this distribution as a function of the individual decision variables y described by the right-hand
side. The parameter ¢ at the denominator highlights that fact that the internal decision variables
evolve on a faster time scale than the external economy configuration variables. According to
Degond et al. [1], the fast evolution of the internal decision variables drives agents performing a
‘rapid march’, i.e. on a O(1/e) time scale, towards a Nash equilibrium, defined by the game of
minimizing the functional ®; in (1.2), up to a diffusion.

(b) The frequent trading limit and the Gibbs measure

In the limit of frequent trading interaction (when ¢ in the previous section is small compared
with 1), the macroscopic dynamics are given by the shape of the solution of Q(f) =0. In the
following, we restrict the form of the nonlinear operator Q such that the coefficients ap and by
in (3.1) depend only on the means of the first two moments of the wealth variable. We define
the vector valued functional Y(f) acting from the space of distribution functions into R? via the
