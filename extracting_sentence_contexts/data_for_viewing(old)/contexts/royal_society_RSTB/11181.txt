closely analogous to the readily apparent obstacles to learn- Percentage problems are generally presented as adding or sub-

decimals. It is far from obvious that 517/103 = 5.01941748. presentation in terms of adding and subtracting makes it easy

to overlook the crucial fact that what is added or subtracted is
obtained by multiplication. When the cost of a litre increases
by 50%, the new price is 1+0.5=3/2 times the old price.
When that price then drops by 50%, the new price is (0.5 x
1.5 = 0.75) of the original price. Although the same percentage
was both added and subtracted, the second operation did not

Nor is it obvious why the fractional representation is com-
plete while decimal representation has no fixed termination,
despite the fact that both notations reference the same pro-
portion. Our thesis is that the difficulty of developing a
bidirectional mapping between the rational numbers and
