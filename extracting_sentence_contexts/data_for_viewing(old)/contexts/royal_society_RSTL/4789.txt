which a still greater preponderance takes place in the amount of several of these
substances formed over that of the others. Whether it would be possible to confine
the decomposition of rubian entirely to one of these processes, or whether all three
are essential, is a question of the highest importance, not s0 much in a theoretical,
as a practical point of view. That beautiful substance, alizarine, is the only one of
these products which is capable of yielding dyes. It is this body which in my opi-
nion gives rise to all the beautiful colours for the production of which madder is
employed. The others are not only useless, they are positively injurious, as I have
shown on a former occasion. Though experimentally alizarine is formed in the
smallest proportion, it is nevertheless theoretically possible to convert rubian entirely
into alizarine, without the least quantity of the other substances being produced.
From this point of view the other substances may be considered as formed at the ex-
pense of alizarine. In fact, by adding together 1 equiv. of verantine and 1 equiv. of
rubiretine, and subtracting 1 equiv. of water, we obtain the elements of 2 equivs. of
alizarine, for
C,, H, O;+C,, H; O,=2(C,, H, O,)+ HO.

Also by adding together 1 equiv. of rubianine and 1 equiv. of s1gar, and subtract-

ing 16 equivs. of water, we obtain the elements of 4 equivs. of alizarine, for
C,, Hz, OÂ»y+C:z His Oj2=4(Cy H; Oy) +16HO.

If any chemist should succeed in changing rubian entirely into alizarine, an under-

taking in which there is no occasion to despair of success, he would be the means of
