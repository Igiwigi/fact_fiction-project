those of the other Indian poisonous Colubrine snakes have received comparatively
little attention, in spite of their well-known deadliness. Now that Caumerrr’s
antivenin has been proved to be effective against Cobra venom it is a matter of
considerable importance to ascertain if the physiological action of the remaining
Colubrine snake-venoms is similar to that of the Cobra or not, and whether CALMETTE’s
serum is effective against them also, or if it is necessary to prepare others which will
act in their case on similar lines. The fact, which I have recently demonstrated (1),
that the poison of the Sea-snakes is identical in its physiological action with Cobra
venom, although of greater potency, suggests the hope that it may prove possible to
obtain a single antidote which will be effective against both these large classes of
venomous snakes. I have, therefore, obtained the dried poisons from India, and in
Part I. of this paper propose to describe their actions and to discuss the bearing of
the facts recorded on the above problem.

This deadly reptile is found, according to Fayrer (2), most frequently in Bengal,
Assam, Burma and Southern India, and is by far the largest of the Indian poisonous
snakes, and probably the largest in the world, the specimen from which my venom
was obtained having measured 13 feet in length. The dried poison has an orange
colour. I am not aware that its physiological action has been closely investigated
