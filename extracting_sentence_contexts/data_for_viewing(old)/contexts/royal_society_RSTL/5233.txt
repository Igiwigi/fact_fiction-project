These may be compared with the corresponding epochs at Toronto, as derived
respectively from the six-years and the twelve-years series discussed in this paper :

Toronto (1842, 5 to 1848, 5) July 28 February 14 April 19 October 15
Toronto (1841 to 1852) July 28 February 12 April 25 October 17

The anomalous character of the North American winter, s0 visible in the Chrono-
Isothermal Plate, is also marked by the very late occurrence of the epoch of the
minimum temperature, and the great dissimilarity in that respect from all the other
stations. The systematic character of this anomaly is further shown by the fact, that
every hour in the twenty-four has its minimum temperature between the 7th and 17th
of February ; the minimum occurs earliest, viz. on the 7th of February, at the hour
of 2p.n.; the minima of the hours of the night, or from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. inclusive,
fall the latest, viz. on the 15th, 16th and 17th of February ; those of the intermediate
hours on the intermediate days and in regular progression. The hours from 6 a.. to
9 p.m. inclusive, or those of the day, have their mazimum temperature between the
20th and 30th of July; those of the night, or from 11 p.m. to 5 A.M. inclusive, from
the 3rd to the 12th of August. 'The portion of the twenty-four hours which is
warmer than the mean temperature of the day varies considerably at different
seasons ; in part of November there are fourteen of the observation hours colder, and
only ten warmer than the mean temperature of the day; in the greater part of July
twelve of the observation hours are colder and twelve warmer; and in all the rest of
