axe often found together in heaps, and are neither rolled nor gnawed. Of very young
Byonw there are no traces.

At the same time Mr. Busk mentions a left metacarpal bone of horse © quite entire
= not rolled, which seems to have been for some time exposed on the surface, or partly
imbedded in the ground, as it is much weathered or sun-cracked, principally at one end ;”
afd he notices the same appearances on some other bones, leading, as he considers, to the
iference that some portion of the bone-remains had been exposed to the open air on
the surface of the ground, and afterwards washed into the cave by the action of a stream
zE water.

ZThe dispersion of the bones of the same limbs in different parts of the cave did not
cB pe the notice of Mr. PEXGELLY, and he accounts for the fact by their separate intro-

Qetion and transport to variable distances into the cave by the stream ; but the cases
iSwhich Mr. Busk has recognized an original connexion between the bones of the same
aJimal in different and distant parts of the cave are sufficiently numerous, and their
general condition is 80 alike and irrespective of position, that it is, we conceive, taking
ay other considerations into account, more probable that the limbs were, as he 8up-
15ses, carried in entire, and that, as they were devoured, the bones were dispersed by the
aZimals themselves through different parts of the cave.

Z”The total number of bones found in the cave amounts to 1621 ; but of these as many
5g 691 belong to birds, rodents, and other small animals, which with few, if any exceptions,
yere brought in at a comparatively recent period, leaving 930 specimens belonging to
