Tue Errect OF A SMALL DOSE OF ATROPIN UPON THE PERCENTAGE COMPOSITION
or SALiva.

Tt has been argued by one of us* that atropin paralyses “ secretory” and “trophic”
fibres simultaneously, The results of Experiments 4 and 9 offer some confirmation of
this.

In both of these experiments a small dose of atropin is given, such that a stimula-
tion of the chorda and injection of pilocarpin still produce some secretion. If atropin
affected the “secretory” before the “trophic” fibres, the saliva obtained after atropin
has been given should contain a high percentage of organic substance in proportion to
its rate of secretion. This is not the case ; on the contrary, the percentage of organic
substance is small; the percentage is, in fact, so small that it, at first sight, appears
as if the “trophic” fibres were affected more than the “secretory” fibres by the
atropin. But we have seen that the secretion of water depends in part upon the
amount of blood flow through the gland. In these experiments, after atropin had
been given, the stimulation of the chorda and the injection of pilocarpin caused a
copious blood flow, with but slight activity of the gland cells; hence, the secretion of
water was abnormally increased.

Sup-LinguaL Saniva.

Werrtuert has shown that the sub-lingual saliva of the Dog contains a very high
percentage of salts, and a rather low percentage of organic substance. The three
analyses given by him are as follows :—
