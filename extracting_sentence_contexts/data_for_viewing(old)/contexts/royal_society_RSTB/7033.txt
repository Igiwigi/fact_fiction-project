MITOTIC ACTIVITY IN THE ADULT FEMALE MOUSE 455

II. MATERIAL AND METHODS
(1) Material

Nearly five hundred female mice were examined in the course of this investigation, and
they belonged, with only a few exceptions, to the following three strains:

(a) Strong’s CBA agouti. These cancer-resistant black agoutis are prolific breeders, and
during the many years in which they have been under observation in the Zoology Depart-
ment of Leeds University, no spontaneous tumours have been recorded in either sex in
spite of the fact that many have been allowed to live to extreme old age.

(b) Kreyberg’s white label albino. Also prolific breeders, these albino mice, isolated by
Kreyberg, have been preserved because of their susceptibility to spontaneous cancer. It
was observed that about 80°, of the females of this strain developed mammary carcinoma
by the time when, at twelve or fourteen months of age, they became senile.

(c) Strong’s A albino, Even more prone to develop mammary cancer than Kreyberg’s
strain, these mice proved to be poor breeders with a relatively high mortality at the time
of birth in both the young and their mothers.

It soon became apparent that the mice of these three strains responded in an exactly
similar manner to the treatment given, and they were therefore mixed indiscriminately in
