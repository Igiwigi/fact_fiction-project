Having found that
the balance last experimented with had its neutral point close to an ordinary Sprengel
vacuum, that the repulsive action only came on by still further pushing the exhaustion,

and that, as I further exhausted, the repulsion got stronger, it was of interest to see
what would take place in a vacuum 80 nearly perfect that it would not carry a current
from a RunMKoRey's coil,


516 MR. W. CROOKES ON ATTRACTION AND

In small tubes, and taking certain special precautions, T could prepare a yacuum with
my Sprengel pump which would hardly allow an induction-current to traverse it, or would
only show a faint, cloud-like discharge ; but it was impossible to effect this in the large
tubes required for these experiments, and, in fact, all the Sprengel vacuum balance-

tubes which I had hitherto prepared became brightly luminous
when the current from an induction-coil was passed through
them. I accordingly fitted up the apparatus shown in figure 5,

in which a chemical vacuum could be prepared by a method
first devised by Dr. AxDREws (Philosophical Magazine, February
1852).

51. ab is the tube containing a straw beam with pith-ball
terminals ; at 6 two platinum wires are passed through, to con-
nect with an induction-coil; at Â« the tube is contracted to allow
the apparatus to be sealed off; c is a portion of the tube con- |
taining a copper boat filled with freshly cast sticks of caustic |
potash; @d is a tube bent as shown, and nearly full of strong |
sulphuric acid, which has been preyiously boiled for some
minutes and then allowed to cool in a vacuum ; & is a mercury
joint, connecting the apparatus to the Sprengel pump.
