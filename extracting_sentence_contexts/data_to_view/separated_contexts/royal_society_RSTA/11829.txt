Digression on the General Theory of Determinants. Art. 51. The foregoing investigation has established the fact that the co-axial
minors, of a general determinant of Order m, are connected by 2" — n? +n — 2
relations, or in other words, that but n? — n + 1 of them ean assume given values. Of these relations a certain number are connected in a special manner with the
determinant of Order n, in that they are not relations merely between the coaxial
minors of one of the principal coaxial minors of the determinant. Let this number be

Ww (),
and put

*— a + n—2= $(n)
Then )

#(0) = (0) + (7) vm — 1) + (3) b(n —2) +. cok (ye:

whence
W (4) = $ (4) =2,
and

H(n) = $(n) = (1) 6 (a= 1) + (3) 6) —... (HH "bs

and, by summation, we obtain the result

w(n) = 1+(— 1)"; (n# 2)
shewing that
(2m) = 2. (m> 1)
w (2m 4+ 1) = 0.
