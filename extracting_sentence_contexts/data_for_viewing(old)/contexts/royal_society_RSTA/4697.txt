us to take any value from the whole interval [—1,1]. The global existence in a specially defined
class of weak solutions was established there. In addition, the non-uniqueness and non-stability
of such weak solutions were discussed in [2] in several examples.

The multi-(space)-dimensional case with the non-ideal relay replaced by the so-called
completed relay was treated in [1], where the global existence result was established for weak
solutions. This completed relay operator /,[u] is the closure of h[u] in suitable weak topologies.
In particular, h,[u] admits any value from the whole interval [—1,1] on the set {a <u <p}
(figure 2). For further details concerning the properties of h-[u], we refer the reader to [10] as
well as to ch. IV of [7].

It was also shown in [1] that for w = £ the problem (1.1)-(1.4) with /,[u] on the right-hand side
of equation (1.1) is, in fact, the two-phase parabolic free boundary problem. The properties of
solutions of this two-phase problem as well as the behaviour of the corresponding free boundary
were completely studied in [11].
