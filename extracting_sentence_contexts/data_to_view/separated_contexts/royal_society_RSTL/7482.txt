* Between the stars 135 and  Orionis the nebulosity narrows to a band of about 5' in
breadth, and then again expands as it approaches :; there has been no attempt to trace
it further in this direction.”

* Again, the nebulosity curves round from the star 6 in a north preceding direction
until it joins a narrow band of faint nebulosity, passing in the preceding and following
direction through the little group of stars of which C Orionis is the brightest.” On many occasions I have examined the neighbourhood of this nebula with the view
of determining, as far as possible, the extent of the nebulosity.
was able to trace it 35' following the trapezium ; this nebulosity was, however, exces-
Sively faint, and of almost uniform intensity ; in fact the only proof of its existence was
the prolongation of the dark lane extending through it from the star 142,, which made
the surrounding region look slightly luminous by contrast. On the north side the
nebulosity appears to be nearly cut off short by the same dark

lane which extends by
the stars 114, 56, 25, 1,,. At the last Star this ceases, and a faint broad streak of

nebulosity appears to curye round in the direction of C Orionis, nearly in the position
deseribed by Mr. HuxTeR.
