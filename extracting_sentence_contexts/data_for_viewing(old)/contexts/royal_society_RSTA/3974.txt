(i) Advection and mixing

It is important to keep in mind that the mineral dust deposition calculated using an in-water tracer
such as Al or Th is recording the addition of that material to each square metre of surface water,
which moves and mixes, not to a geographically static region in the manner of dust deposition
maps calculated from real or modelled atmospheric aerosol loads. The degree to which values
calculated from these different approaches differ will be directly related to the direction and the
relative velocity of the surface water advection; however, there is no reliable way to correct for
this advection effect because surface waters do not move as a coherent uniform slab but instead
mix with the surrounding water as they move. While each of these estimates has its particular
value in quantifying atmospheric deposition processes, from an oceanographic perspective the
imprint of a dissolved tracer such as Al or Th in surface water is in fact the most relevant
parameter for understanding the impact of dust deposition on oceanic biogeochemical processes.
Dissolved tracer concentrations can be used, by ratio, to track the addition of other materials from
atmospheric aerosols to the surface water, including nutrients and micronutrients such as Fe, the
addition of which can exert significant biological effects.
