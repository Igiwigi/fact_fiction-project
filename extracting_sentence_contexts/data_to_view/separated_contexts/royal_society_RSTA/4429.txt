A detailed proof of theorem 4.1 is given in §6. Statements (i)—(iii) of theorem 4.1 follow, with
some calculation, from the definitions of ‘determinable’ and ‘proposition’. Statement (iv) follows
from the facts that P is a probabilistic frame on 9(X) and P C g(X). Statement (v) is a consequence
of Statements (i)—(iv) and theorems of lattice theory that characterize the orthomodular law. The following notation is useful.
