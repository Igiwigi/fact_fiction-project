-C'est 1a, a mon ens, un des grands mysteres des
puissances nerveuses, inystere qui sera d6yoils tot ou tard, et dont la decouverte
jettera la plus vive lumiere sur le m6chanisme des fonctions de cette meryeil-
leuse puissance+,” It was impossiþble to explain this difficulty whilst the moye-
ments of the excited reflex function were confounded with those of yoluntary
motion ; but when this distinction is duly made, nothing is more easy. De-
capitation removes, in fact, the sources both of voluntary and of respiratory
motion ; both these kinds of motion consequently cease: but a class of motions
Still remains, viz. those of the reflex function, attached to the remaining por-
tion of medulla. Thus is the veil raised from this apparent * mystery*.
