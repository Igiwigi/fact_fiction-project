ORGANIZATION OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES. 743

Mr. Nety’s specimen thus affords a certain amount of evidence that Lyginodendron
Old ium, or some allied species, may have attained the dimensions of a small tree.

As regards the habit of the ordinary small specimens, with which we are familiar,
the radial symmetry of the stem and the fact that adventitious roots, when present,
ave given off on all sides, render it probable that the plant grew in an upright
position. The longest piece of stem which we have is burely three inches (7°6 centims.)
in length (C.N. 1207 A). The position of the nodes in this specimen is not very
vident ; two, however, can be distinguished and they are about one inch (2°5
centims.) apart.
_ From the course of the vascular bundles we know that the total length of the
‘stem must have included many internodes, for, if our interpretation of the facts be
correct, it follows that each transverse section of the stem usually shows the traces
2 of the next ten leaves above. We must, therefore, picture Lyginodendron to
ourselves as having a tall, upright stem rising to a height of several feet and bearing
somewhat remote, spirally arranged, highly compound, fern-like leaves. The base of
> the stem, where the adventitious roots were given off, must have been buried for
