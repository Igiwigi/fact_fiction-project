The
greatest magnitude of this retarding force must be equal to the greatest tangential. cohe-
8ive power of the ice. This is, in fact, the greatest force which the walls, however irre-
gular, could possibly exercise in opposing the sliding past them of the general mass of
the glacier. To simplify our problem as much as possible, I shall also first suppose the
glacier of uniform width and thickness, and the inclination of its bed to be likewise
uniform. We may ther consider A and B each' =0, F-shall als suppose C=0, and
