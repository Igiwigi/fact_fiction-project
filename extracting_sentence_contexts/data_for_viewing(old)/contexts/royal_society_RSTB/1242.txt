be similar to that of the sporogenous masses themselves.
I have not been able to decide whether the archesporium is here defined at o
the first periclinal division of the superficial cells (fig. 120), or whether sue
additions are made to the sporogenous tissue by subsequent periclinal divisi¢
superficial cells, as in Hguisetum, and in a less degree in Jsoctes and Selagin ell
am, however, inclined to think the latter to be the case, since in such exam}
that shown in fig. 124, the superficial cells are very deep, while the lower cells aren
As the development proceeds, the original arrangement of the cells become
turbed by unequal growth (fig. 126); the more superficial layers develop int
rather massive wall, and the cells immediately surrounding the sporogenous
become compressed, and ultimately disorganized. It has been above noted that

clearly defined tapetum, nor is the whole of the sporogenous mass used up i
