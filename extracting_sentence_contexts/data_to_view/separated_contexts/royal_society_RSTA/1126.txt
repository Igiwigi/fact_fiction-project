(146) The excess of pressure due to the total load is found by adding the right-hand sides of (145)
and (146). We note the following facts :

TueoreM XXIV.—Under a purely axial load X, the pressure in the membrane increases
or decreases steadily from P —2X/A at the apex to P at the margin, according as X is
positive or negative. The critical axial load (which reduces the pressure at the apex to
zero) is a pulling force
