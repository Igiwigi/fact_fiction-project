‘On Pike’s Peak the
respiratory centre was presumably reacting to a difference in cH corresponding to
this very small difference in CO,* pressure” (16). Later, HanpANr gave up this
view, and took his stand with the Copenhagen School (20), who believe that the
excitability of the respiratory centre is a variable quantity during health. He
pointed out that the observed facts might be met on the hypothesis that the lack of
oxygen increased the irritability of the respiratory centre, causing increased total
ventilation ; the secondary results would be loss of CO, by the blood and decreased
hydrogen-ion concentration, which might or might not become wholly compensated
by the kidney. The same view is held by YanprELi Henperson, who has demon-
strated the order in which changes take place in animals (18). Much doubt then has centred around the possible alterations in the hydrogen-ion
concentration of the blood, and the extent to which they are responsible for a
physiological adaptation under discussion, ¢.e.
