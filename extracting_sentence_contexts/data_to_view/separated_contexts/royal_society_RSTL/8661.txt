to 37” existed at depths in both
the great oceans. ARaGo, in commenting on these results, testifies to their accuracy
and importance, and remarks that * the observations collected by the © Venus* will
occupy a distinguished place, on account of their number and exactness, and of the
great depths at which they were taken.” He also obseryes that, low as some of the
readings are, yet all errors must be positive, and that they place on reliable grounds the
great fact of the prevalence of the same low temperatures at depths in the Pacific as
well as in the Atlantic, and in the equatorial regions of both oceans ; and he especially
dwells on the cireumstance that they tend effectually to disprove the hypothesis which,
had been advanced, that at great depths there existed a uniform and common tempe-
rature of 40” F.

It appears, nevertheless, that so little was known of what had already been done and
written, that Sir James Ross fell into the very same errors as D'URviiLE had made
thirteen years before. Unfortunately in this case his conclusions were accepted without
examination by distinguished writers in two popular works on Physical Geography, and
obtained a currency for which it is difficult to acconnth. Although Sir Jaxts Ross's
experiments were in themselves valuable, they required both detail and corroboration,
and his conclusions were evidently based on an as8umption for which there was no
warrant.
