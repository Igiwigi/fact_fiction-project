traction appear to be blended and diffused, that rhythmic action is of the most frequent
occurrence ; and it is obvious with how much greater difficulty the resistance theory is
here beset than is the one which I now propose. Granted a diffused power of stimu-
lation with a diffused power of response, and I see no essential difference between the
rhythmic motions of the simplest organism and those of a deganglionated Medusa in
acidulated water,

But now, in conclusion, I wish it to be distinetly understood that I am not attempt-
ing to overturn, bub merely to snpplement, the current theory of ganglionie action.
My belief is that this theory is to a large extent a true one, but that in order to
become a complete theory it must incorporate the facts and inferences which have now
been fully detailed. By a complete theory I mean, of course, a theory which will
cover all the facts; and forasmuch as the facts on which my inferences are founded

of this organ at a 8mall cost of nervous energy. How far the rhythm of the nectocalyx is to be attributed
to the resistance mechanism of the ganglia, and how far to the alternate exhaustion and recoyery of the
contractile tissues, T think it is impossible to determine, secing that it is impossible exactly to imitate the
natnral ganglionic stimulation by artificial means. But ib is, 1 think, of importance to have ascertained
at least this mnch : that in Sarsia the tonus of one organ and the rhythm of another, which apparently
both recoived their stimulation from the same ganglia, must at any rate in part be attributed to a differ-
ential irritability of these organs as distinguished from their differential stimulation.
