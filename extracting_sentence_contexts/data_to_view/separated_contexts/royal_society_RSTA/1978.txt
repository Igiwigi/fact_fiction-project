In this case
we find series associated with it whose successive lines are given by A+@ (m). This holds for each of the triplet sets, so that the complete series are given by
A+qm, B+¢ (m), C+¢ (m), where B= A+1864, C = A+1864+830. Quite apart
from the importance of this fact in the theory of spectral series the phenomenon is of
special use in calculating the various constants on which the series depends. For
instance the sum of the wave-numbers of two corresponding lines gives 2A, 2B, 2C,
thus determining the values of the limits quite independently of the nature of the
series formula used. Moreover, the displacements which so frequently occur in the
F and D series in the sequence term introduces uncertainties.
