The Middle Coal
Measures flora of the Wyre Forest is a rich one, 55 species being recorded here, of
which two are new species and four new records from Britain. The Transition Coal
Measures flora, as at present known, is smaller, 20 species being here described, of
which one is a new British record. It has been pointed out that the key to the general structure of the Wyre Forest,
which must be always considered in relation to Coalbrookdale, is the recognition of
the fact that in this area there are in reality four distinct coalfields. The lower
series of Coalbrookdale forms one of these, quite isolated from the second coalfield of
the same age in the Wyre Forest, i.e. the Sweet Coal Series or Middle Coal Measures
of the Highley, Shatterford and Dowles Valley Regions. It has been shown that the
fossil flora of the Lower Coal Series of Coalbrookdale indicates that these beds belong
to the same horizon as the Sweet Coals of the Wyre Forest, though lithologically
they are quite distinct.
