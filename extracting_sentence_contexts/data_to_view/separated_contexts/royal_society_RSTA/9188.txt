On the first hyperbola there is a fairly strong (210), a weaker (111), and
avery weak (410). There is no sign of (010), but there is a clear, sharp are in the position
of (020) on the second hyperbola. The fact that this are never closes up into a sharp
spot suggests that it is perhaps in reality composite, for instance, (020) flanked by (120)
or (021). On the same hyperbola there is also a faint spot near the position of (220). On the third hyperbola there are weak ares corresponding to (230), and underneath
them a still weaker reflection (030).
