The pyramidal elements of the third layer increase in size with their depth, are most
densely congregated in the upper half of the layer, whilst the lower half is left as a
paler zone, in which towards the fissxure of ROLANDO we can readily trace the gradual
increase of angular and small pyramidal elements, which, as above stated, form in the
ascending parietal a distinet belt dividing the cortex into six layers. Regional Distribution. It will be seen that we have in the foregoing description anticipated many of the
facts regarding relative areas of different laminations and distribution of the ganglionic
series. The whole superior arc of the great limbic lobe, from its origin near the
olfactory lobe backwards as far as the retro-limbic annectant, presents us with the best
example of the clustered arrangement of the ganglionic cells. These cell clusters are
most thickly grouped, and most rich in cells in the anterior regions of this upper are,
attaining their maximum development in the vicinity of the crucial 8lceus.
