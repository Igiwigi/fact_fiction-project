The so-called “choroidal fissure” is not, of course, a fissure in any sense of the word.
T have in another papert suggested that it should be termed “ hiatus ventriculi.”

DR. A. HILL ON THE CEREBRUM OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS PARADOXUS. 375

Is the dentary fissure a true fissure? The fact that the same terminology is used
in this as in other parts of the brain has led, as I think, to fruitless attempts to
homologize the several structures which make up the “hippocampus” with other
. of the pallium. The hippocampus is altogether different in constitution from
the rest of the pallium, and forms, as was recognized by Broca and by ZucKER-
 KANDL, a part of the rhinencephalon. Topographically it belongs to the rhinen-
cephalon, It varies in size with the rest of the rhinencephalon, Its essential con-
stituent, the fascia dentata, is, as I have shown in the paper referred to, absent when
the olfactory bulb is absent.
S The cerebral cortex is divisible, therefore, into the part which belongs to the
5 ipihinencephalon and the part outside it.
= If we accept the view that the convolution of the brain is due to mechanical
causes, that is to say, to the necessity for disposing of a layer of superficial tissue, the
