Linear
causal models and responses that work well within short
temporal and spatial frames are inadequate for dealing with
outcomes embedded in complex ecological and social relation-
ships. To list drivers of EIDs as a list of independent variables
is deceptive; they are entangled in complex spatial and temporal
webs in which relationships change over time. There are no
definitive experiments in such situations, where ‘facts are uncer-
tain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent’ [31].

5. Complexity and narratives

If experiments and models are not up to the task, where can we
turn? Some ecosystems researchers concluded that complexity,

as manifest in wicked problems, are best investigated and
understood using narratives, including diverse contend-
ing narratives [17,27,28].
