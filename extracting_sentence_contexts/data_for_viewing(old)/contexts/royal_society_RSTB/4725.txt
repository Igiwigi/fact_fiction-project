from the passage quoted on p. 27. But there are several objections to this.
In the first place, if the lower layers are really connected with colour-
production, it is impossible to explain why the colour vanishes on shaving or
scratching the wing surface of most beetles. Secondly, sections from the wings of a
number of beetles, among them several investigated by BrepeRMANN, are figured
and described later, but excepting in certain peculiar Cetoniids, no trace of any
structure corresponding to the “ Stdébchenschicht” could be discovered. It seems
possible that BreDERMANN may have mistaken the net-like pattern (“ Wabenwerk”),
nearly always to be seen on the wing-cases, for the ends of the rods or
“ Stdbchen,” and referred to the presence of a “ Stdébehenschicht,” which only existed
in a few exceptions. These include Heterorrhina elegans, Fapr., as well as
H. africana, Drury,t which differ from ordinary beetles in their structure, and in
the fact that their colour remains after removal of the surface cuticle. Moreover, all
sections cut tangentially to the surface show the characteristic colour, even when
mounted in Canada balsam, if they are examined by reflected light. These rods,
which contain yellow pigment, may possibly scatter blue light, as has been suggested
in the case of many similar structures. To do this, the rods should’ be small when
compared with the wave-length of light, that is to say, not larger than the more
complex molecules, and it is doubtful, in view of the short range of wave-length
of visible light, whether there would be a corresponding effect, when the rods are
comparable in size to a wave-length as in this case.

There is one interesting observation that can conveniently be dealt with at this
point. Though at first sight it is suggestive of a case in which at least some of the
colour might be attributed to the scattering of small particles, this cannot well be so.
