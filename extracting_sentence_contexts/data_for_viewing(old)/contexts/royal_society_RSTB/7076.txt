shot in the course of this enquiry, 559, or 71-1 %, were males. This proportion agrees closely
with that given for the starling in the United States of America by Hicks (1934), who found
that out of a total of 3161 birds, 2148, or 67-9°%, were males. In Holland, Kluijver (1935)
has stated that there are more males than females, but although such large numbers of

birds have not been examined, the preponderance of males over females in that country
does not appear to be so extreme. Brouwer (1929) found a proportion of 159 males to
146 females, and van Dobben (see Kluijver 1935) a proportion of 166 males to 124 females.
An excess of males over females appears therefore to be a feature of starling populations,
and the fact that the first-year males do not normally breed whereas the first-year females
do, helps to restore the balance between the sexes. Perhaps also one sex has a greater
expectation of breeding life than the other, although this would be difficult to prove.
Hicks (1934), again referring to the starling in the United States of America where a great
amount of ringing of the species has been done, states that few of the 5- and 6-year-old
birds which he has handled had yellow beaks. As will be seen later, this means that they
were not in breeding condition, and perhaps therefore the bird is only able to breed four
or five times.

The reasons for the unbalanced sex ratio are not easily apparent. There appears
to be no differential mortality of eggs or young birds in the nest, as most eggs
hatch and are successfully fledged. Young birds just off the nest were obtained, and
of 101 of these juveniles, 64, or 63-4°%, were males. This somewhat lower ratio of
