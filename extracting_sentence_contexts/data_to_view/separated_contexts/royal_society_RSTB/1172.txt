The opinion of most authors is evidently that it
does so exist. We feel, however, very strongly that the methods hitherto adopted by
hese authors are not definitive, and do not establish the positions claimed. We are led
% this conclusion from the consideration of certain facts now to be discussed which have
Bme under our notice in the present research, as well as of others previously dis-
dvered, the importance of which has of late become more recognised. By welding
fhe fresh information, which the use of our method has given, to the old, we hope to
Bplp forward the solution of this apparently simple but very complex subject. ยง (1.)
