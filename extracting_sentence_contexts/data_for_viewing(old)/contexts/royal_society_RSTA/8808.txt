The experiments of Barapuc Muturr (‘Iron and Steel Institute, Carnegie
Scholarship Memoirs,’ 1914, p. 216), on the extraction of gases from molten steel,
showed that steel is permeable to gases down to 600° C.

Other Experiments.

The action of water on carbide of calcium, and of concentrated sulphuric acid on
sugar for 6 hours under pressure of 30,000 atmospheres were tried; in both cases
amorphous carbon was formed and no diamond.

HAnwnAY’s experiments were repeated, where paraffin and dipple-oil with the alkali
metals, especially potassium, were sealed in steel tubes and subjected to a red heat
for-several hours. The analysis gave no diamonds; in fact it became apparent that
when hydrocarbons or water were relied on to produce pressure, the latter could only
exist for a short time at the commencement, for when a red heat was reached the
hydrogen escaped through the metal, and the oxygen combined with the steel.

We did not analyse the steel tubes themselves. Many experiments were however
tried with central heating under the press at 6000 atmospheres, and nothing was
obtained of interest with the substances used by Hannay, unless, as previously
mentioned, some iron was present. F'RIEDLANDER’S experiment was repeated, where a
molten globule of olivine, in a reducing flame, or with carbon added, was stated by
him to contain minute diamonds. An experiment was made with molten olivine in a
carbon crucible in a wind furnace stirred with a carbon rod, with and without an
electric current passing between the rod and crucible.
