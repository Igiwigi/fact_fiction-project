The value of W — V was 1176 for 25 minutes, 1238 for 2°5 minutes, and 1233 for
3°25 minutes. From these we obtain, as the mean value of W —, V, 1187, and hence V = 4568. The fact that there was a break in the middle so that four readings of the
chronometer are involved, renders the time measurement less trustworthy than in the
other experiments. Bowls I. and IV. were used. Experiment 7, August 12, afternoon.
