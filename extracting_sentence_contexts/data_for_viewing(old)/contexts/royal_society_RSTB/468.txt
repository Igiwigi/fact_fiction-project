e and delicate tissue, the pulp, in its natural relations to a hard, calcified tissue,
thie dentine, the difficulties have been greatest, and it has generally been found
Icessary to resort to decalcification of the hard tissue by acids, to ensure this
tention of the natural relations of the parts.

£ Even, however, by this method, aided by the improved processes of section cutting
@w in use, good preparations, in which the cells of the pulp are retained in
Fadisturbed contact with the dentine through any great extent of surface, are
Brnparatively yare, and the cells of the pulp usually exhibit by their shrunken
<ondition the injurious effects of the reagents used.

3 It is probable also that there are other detrimental effects of these reagents present,
ae are not so easily detected, and the fact of the lime salts being -removed from

e dentine, does, as I shall endeavour to show, produce an alteration in its
microscopical appearances.

By a process elaborated by Dr. L. A Wein, of Munich, and suggested to him by a
method employed by Professor von Kocu, of Darmstadt, in the preparation of
Mollusea, the last-named difficulties have been overcome, and we can now cut
preparations of the teeth with the pulps in situ, without decalcification. The process
was described by Dr. Wetn in a paper entitled ‘Zur Histologie der Zahnpulpa’
(Leipzig, 1887), and in the ‘ Zeitschrift fiir Wissenschaftliche Mikroskopie’ (vol. 5,
1888, pp. 200-202), also by myself in the ‘ Transactions of the Odontological Society
of Great Britain’ (vol. 22, May, 1890).
