can repeat readings of that feature of a line which they take to be the centre—an
estimate of little value for the present purpose. In deducing data from a set of
lines it is thus possible to express their errors in terms of the original errors in the
observations, and limits to the latter give limiting variations to the former. We
therefore know with certainty what latitude in inferences is permissible, and are
often enabled to say that such inference is not justifiable.

The formule of Ryppere or of Kayser and Runex are sufficient in general to
identify lines as belonging to a given series, except in the cases of lines in the infra
red, where the order is 1 or even 2, but they are not sufficiently accurate for our
purpose. It is necessary to obtain formule for the various series which can reproduce
the known series within limits of error or, if this is impossible, with as few outside as
possible. The fact that Ryppere’s formula contains two arbitrary constants, whereas
K.R.’s have three, and the well-known relationships brought to light by Ryppera’s
formula naturally suggest it as the basis for a second approximation. In the absence
of any definite theory as to the nature of the vibrations giving rise to spectral lines,
it is necessary to make some assumption and to test it by its results. The most
natural one clearly is to suppose that in RypBere’s form A—N/(D)? where D = m+p,
D is some function of m which can be expanded in a series of which m+y is the first
term. Comparison with observation shows that his formula becomes more exact with
increasing m, and that, therefore, the function should be expansible in negative
powers of m. In other words,
