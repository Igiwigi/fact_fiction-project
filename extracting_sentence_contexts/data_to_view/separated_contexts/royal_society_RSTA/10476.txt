Thus the French population would have to be extended to a boundary in which only
about 1 in six millions was excluded, and the Aino population to a boundary excluding
only 15 in the billion! The boundaries of what we may thus term the selection
populations are far larger than our conventional boundaries of 1 in 1000 for represen-
tative populations. In fact, it would be impossible to select a representative Aino
population from a conventional representative French population and vice versaâ€”in
either case the very exceptional members of French or Aino populations are
required to complete the conventional representative populations of Aino or French
by selection,

(15.) I have devoted most of my consideration of the surface of survivals to
a particular case in which two organs have been selected, and we consider the nature
of p which determines the fraction of each group of individuals which survives. I have done this partly because normal surfaces are at best only an approximate
representation of our selectable and selected distributions, and partly because I have
thought a concrete case would best bring out the general points of investigations of
this kind. But some little indication of the properties of the surface of survival-rates ought
to be indicated here, or it may appear that they have been overlooked.
