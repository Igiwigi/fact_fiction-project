every attempt at a solution was defeated. But why, it may be asked, attempt such solutions? Was it mere prejudice against
the doctrine of spontaneous generation that prevented me from frankly submitting to

stration of the doctrine? By no means. The only prejudice I feel is the wholesome
repugnance to accepting momentous conclusions on insufficient grounds.
