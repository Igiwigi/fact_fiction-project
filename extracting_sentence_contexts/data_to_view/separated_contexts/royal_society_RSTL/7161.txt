under a layer of paraffin at 100* C. Much chloride of methyl is given off, and a thick
oily mass separates out on cooling, and when no further quantity is formed the reaction
may be considered finished®.
'The reaction which takes place may be written thus—
C,, Hz, N O;+2H Cl=C,, Hz, N O,+2CH, Cl. ;
To purify the chloride, and to obtain the base from. it, advantage is taken of the fact
that it is comparatively insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, whereas in strong hydro-
chloric acid as well as in pure water it dissolves readily. After the reaction is finighed
the contents of the flask are allowed to. cool.. The liquid portion (strongly acid) is
poured into a large beaker, and the oily mass dissolyed in hot water, allowed to cool,
and then poured into the strongly acid solution. 'This causes a precipitate, and water
or hydrochloric acid is added in case either produce a further precipitate.
