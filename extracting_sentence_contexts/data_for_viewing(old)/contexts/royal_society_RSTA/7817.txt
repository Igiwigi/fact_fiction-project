magneto-ionic component should apparently have the form shown in fig. 2. He does

not, however, offer any convincing interpretation of such a curious result.

In §2 of the present paper we develop a different method for describing oblique
propagation of a magneto-ionic component through the ionosphere, avoiding the use
of a refractive index uv which depends in a complicated way upon an unknown angle of
refraction y. This method makes the validity of Schekulin’s result almost obvious. The
explanation of the result depends on the fact that in a doubly refracting medium the
direction of group-propagation in general differs from that of phase-propagation.
Fig. 2 represents only the phase-propagation of a magneto-ionic component, whereas
it is the group-propagation which yields a cuspless ray of more conventional type.
The level of reflexion of a magneto-ionic component is the level where its direction of
group-propagation becomes horizontal. By studying the propagation of wave-packets
through the ionosphere we deduce in §3 that this level is given by the upper cusp in
fig. 2, and not by the lower cusp, which merely gives the level where the direction of
phase-propagation becomes horizontal. The fact that the level of reflexion ofa magneto-
