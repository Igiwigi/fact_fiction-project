cylinder, enclosing a medulla, from the exterior of which cylinder the leaf-traces
received their vascular elements. Later in life two fragments belonging to different
plants were obtained by him, in each of which there existed the central cylinder seen

in Lepidodendron Harcourtii; but in both cases this cylinder, which he had
designated étui médullaire, or equivalent of the protoxylem or medullary sheaf of
recent exogenous stems, was surrounded by a secondary zone of wood, developed
exogenously through the instrumentality of a cambium layer. BroneNtIarT was
unfortunately biassed by the fact that no such secondary growth existed amongst living
Cryptogams—to which group he correctly determined the Lepidodendra to belong.
The existence of a secondary, exogenously-developed, vascular zone was a clear proof
in his eyes that his new plants could not be Cryptogams ; hence he referred them to
the family of Gymnosperms. and connected them with the well-known Carboniferous
plants called Sigillarie.

The conclusions thus arrived at by the great French paleontologist were almost
universally accepted at the «ime when I began my investigations into these subjects,
some thirty years ago ; I soon obtained clear proofs that many of the Carboniferous
Cryptogams, unlike their lying representatives, were provided with a secondary,
exogenously-developed, vascular zone. “That this is the case with most of Brone-
nrArt’s Lepidodendra is now an almost universally accepted fact. But these plants
