But in our situation, attribution
might prove both too easy and too hard. In contrast to extreme-weather events like tornadoes
or flash floods, researchers are reasonably good at identifying causative links between global
warming and at least some slow-onset events (desertification and rising sea temperatures, for
example). In fact, this is one reason why Schleussner and his colleagues can estimate declines in
wheat yield and coral reefs as they do. But this predictability again cuts against an insurerâ€™s need
to diversify. Claimants would learn how to show the causal link in certain kinds of cases and
would do so consistently.
