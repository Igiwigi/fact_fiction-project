that in not a single instance out of our numerous cultures during 1909-11 did the
type of inheritance show any change. If the inheritance in our larvee were of the
nature of that described by Tennent for Hippono√© and Toxopneustes, that is that it
can be influenced by some external condition, such as the reaction, salinity, and
temperature of the sea-water at the time of, or after fertilization, then it is remarkable
that in all these cultures, in many of which these conditions must have varied widely,
no stimulus should have been present capable of bringing about some change.

The fact that no such change took place in any of these cultures lends a certain
amount of support to our belief that, whatever may have been the cause that brought
about the change of inheritance in 1912, it was one that acted on the germ cells
during their period of growth and maturation, and not at the time of fertilization or
afterwards.

We suggest that in the variation of the water temperature in the winter of
1911-12 is possibly to be sought this disturbing factor ; our records, however, do not
extend over a sufficient number of years to allow us to form at present a definite
conclusion. It will remain for future investigation to prove or disprove this
suggestion.

It is certain that something adversely affected the eggs of H. miliaris in 1912 so
