302 MR. NEWPORT ON THE TEMPERATURE OF INSECTS.

time to time the rise and fall of each thermometer, and to note the difference between
them, the temperature of the air being of course taken in the immediate vicinity of
the bee-house. By this course of observation it was found that the temperature of
the hive, when the bees are in a state of repose, varies with that of the atmosphere,
but that the change within the hive is never s0 rapid as in the atmosphere, unless
the bees have been disturbed. When the temperature of the atmosphere has risen very
suddenly, I have found it exceed that of the hive by one or two degrees, as in Table XY1.
No. 173, provided the bees continue in a state of entire rest ; but if, on the contrary,
the temperature of the atmosphere be suddenly diminished, that of the hive will 8ub-
side also, but with much less rapidity. These facts are shown in the observations,
Table XIV. Nos. 85 and 86, and also in all the observations on the tables which were
made after one o'clock at noon on each day during the winter. Sometimes the ther-
mometers became exactly equal to each other, as in No. 124. On the other hand,
when the bees are in a state of activity and respiring quickly, the hive is eyen then
affected in the winter months by great changes in the temperature of the external
atmosphere, particularly if these changes occur late in the autumn or in the beginning
of the winter s8eason. But a change in the temperature of the atmosphere in summer
does not 80 readily affect the temperature of the hive, because in summer, when the
general temperature of the atmosphere ranges from 45* Fans. upwards, the bees are
always in a state of activity, and are not themselyes 80 readily affected by sudden
atmospheric changes of temperature; while in winter, when the temperature of the
season ranges from 452 Fans. downwards, the bees are very 800n affected by dimi-
