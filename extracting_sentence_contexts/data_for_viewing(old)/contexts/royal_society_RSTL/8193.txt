> into a thin layer, not because their stems were succulent, but because these hard woody
and cellular cortical tissues broke up or were floated out of their epidermal sheath ;

2 It is a remarkable circumstance that whilst the woody zone is the part that has 80
= frequently disappeared amongst the larger specimens of Lepidodendroid plants, and
Z especially amongst the Sigillarize, it is the part which is the most frequently preserved in
= the Stigmarian roots of the latter plant. TI presume that this fact is to be explained by
L the different circumstances surrounding the two structures. The stems overthrown by
S 8torms were equally exposed to the decomposing influences of a warm humid atmosphere,
5 whether they were prostrated on the ground or stood up as decapitated stumps. Such
AQ atmospheric influences would speedily destroy all but the tough superficial layers. The
roots, on the other hand, imbedded deeply in wet mud, would be preserved from all
atmospheric action; hence the beautiful preservation of their vascular tissues: these
are often compressed and displaced, but rarely destroyed. The cellular bark, on the
other hand, with the exception of the epidermal layer, and also the medullary cells,
bave yielded much more frequently to the decomposing influences that surrounded them
even though protected by the soil.
What we know of the origin of the leaf-scars in living plants has left little room for
hesitation respecting their nature in the fossils under consideration ; but some of the
