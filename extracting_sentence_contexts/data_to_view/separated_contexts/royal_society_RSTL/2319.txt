84. Many of the phenomena treated of in the course of this paper do not seem to
have been contemplated in the more perfect theories of electricity : they may not,
however, on that account be the less deserving of consideration ; indeed, it is ex-
tremely uncertain whether any views of electricity hitherto adopted have been 80
completely verified as to render all doubts of their accuracy unpardonable. The con-
ditions of electrical action generally assumed as the basis of calculation, do not un-
frequently give rise to equations extremely complicatedâ€”in some cases very imprac-
ticable; and although the highest efforts of genius have been exerted in vanquishing
the difficulties, it remains yet to be seen, whether, by an extended induction of facts,
we may not succeed in arriving at easier views of electricity, and hence bring this
department of science more completely under the dominion of analysis. Plymouth,
