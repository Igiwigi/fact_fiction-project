The fact that the negative emission from a Wehnelt cathode often takes some time
before it reaches its full strength is considered by FrepENHAGEN to support his view
of the action of these cathodes. An investigation of this effect was therefore made in
the case of the Nernst filament material heated upon platinum. For this purpose a
strip of platinum foil was welded on to the platinum leads of the discharge tube and
was covered with the material ofa Nernst filament in the manner which has already
been described.
