illustrates a crystal showing faces of ¢ {001} and g {011} very like those of a
potassium salt of the series. In all four salts of the iron group there is a marked
tendency for a larger development of the faces of 7’{201} than in the other groups of
double selenates studied. A similar fact was observed with respect to the ferrous
iron group of double sulphates. Crystal Elements and Angles.—The axial angles and axial ratios are compared in
the following table. Comparison of the Axial Angles and Axial Ratios.
