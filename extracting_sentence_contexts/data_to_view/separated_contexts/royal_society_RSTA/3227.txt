In other words, the phase transition boundaries propagate even faster when To(t) and
u(t) fluctuate simultaneously. As this takes place, the solid fraction g,(t) decreases with increasing
er and ¢,. This is due to the fact that the mushy layer thickness b(t) — a(t) also expands with
growing noise, which in turn decreases its solid fraction.

5. Conclusion

In the present paper, we constructed two exact analytical solutions of nonlinear unsteady-state
mushy layer equations that describe the directional crystallization of binary mixtures (sea ice—
water systems) with allowance for turbulent motion in the liquid. The first exact analytical
solution that describes the freezing scenario with a constant atmospheric temperature and friction
velocity is found in a parametric form.
