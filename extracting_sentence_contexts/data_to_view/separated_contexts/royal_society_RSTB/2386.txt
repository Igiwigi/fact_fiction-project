that the more convex side is the peripheral one. The annulus is not exactly vertical,
a but, running round the margin of the sporangium to the attachment of the stalk, it
Q is there slightly diverted to one side (fig. 131); usually the sequence of cells of the
+ annulus is not wholly interrupted by the insertion of the stalk, but its cells are more
‘g or less in contact with one another, and the annulus is in such cases actually con-
# tinuous at the base, as it is in those sporangia where it is more conspicuously oblique. “” In fact the sporangium of D. apiifolia shows, though in a less obvious degree than in
S Dicksonia, the oblique annulus. The nearer side of the sporangium shown in fig. 131
8 is the less convex one; it is the “ central” face, and corresponds structurally to that
