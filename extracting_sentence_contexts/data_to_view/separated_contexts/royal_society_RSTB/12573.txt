In particular, the posterior lateral
line (PLL) is the portion located over the trunk and tail of the animal [1]. In the last decades, the development of PLL in zebrafish embryos has been
widely employed as a good predictive model to shed light on the main
biophysical mechanisms at the basis of the collective and coordinated cell organi-
zation and migration characterizing both physiological (e.g. organogenesis
or wound healing) and pathological situations (e.g. tumour growth or the Duch-
enne muscolar dystrophy), see [3-6] and references therein. In particular, the large
experimental use of this highly fecund small tropical fish is mainly owing to the
fact that (i) it has almost 70% of human genes, (ii) its embryos are transparent and
(iii) rapidly develop outside its body (in about 2448 h after fertilization). The embryonic development of the zebrafish PLL begins around 19 h post egg
fertilization (hpf) with the formation of a small placode of about 100 epithelial
cells (with mesenchymal characteristics), named primordium (PLLp), located in
the horizontal myoseptum just caudal to the otic vesicle, see figure 1a [2,7]. Then different phases can be identified.
