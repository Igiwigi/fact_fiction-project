6. Closing remarks

A decade ago, UHF researchers had proven that cortical col-
umns were accessible to fMRI experiments and were
wondering whether the cortical vascular structure would
permit depth-resolved functional MRI applications. In the
past 5 years, we have seen proof that laminar fMRI profiles
can be measured and do exhibit task-dependent and stimu-
lus-dependent modulation that is consistent with known
properties of the underlying neuronal populations [33]. Lami-
nar fMRI is possible and, in fact, easier to verify than studies
seeking to identify cortical columns because the GM and WM
boundaries provide good landmarks for verifying the
accuracy of laminar analyses. There have, however, also
been many convincing demonstrations of the presence of
confounding factors in both data acquisition and analysis.

The confounding factor that is the most important but
also the most difficult to demonstrate is the potential for
mis-registration between functional data and the anatomical
boundaries that delineate the GM depth. It is clear that seg-
mentation of GM on images that have the same distortion as
the functional data is the best approach for addressing this
