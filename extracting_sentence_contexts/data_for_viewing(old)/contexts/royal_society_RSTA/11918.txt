instance, to CLozz, who does not give, however, any reason for its use. So far ag
know the only point which can be urged in its support is that fatty matter appea
to have the power of removing in some measure the evil-smelling oil when it is pres
in the liquid, because experience goes to show that after ordinary carbon bisulphi

loses its nasty odour. A quantity of olive oil was added to one sample of our purifig
liquid and a quantity of white wax was dissolved in another. After three weeks th
two products were distilled without ebullition from a water bath, but in neither ¢ ;
was any alteration produced in the rotation, d

We have gone into this question of the mode of purifying carbon bisulphide in som
detail since it has been proposed to utilize observations of the rotation in this ligui
as a means of measuring strong currents. The facts go to show that for the purpose
of magnetic rotation it is not difficult to obtain carbon bisulphide which is practical,
pure. Indeed, we found that our stock liquid (“ pure redistilled ” carbon bisulphi¢
from Hopkry and WititAms), without any treatment, although it was somewha
opaque, gave almost the same rotation as it did after treatment. By merely shakin
with mercury the opacity can be removed.

It will be evident from the above discussion that the probable sources of error in
the measurements tend to give too low a value, and hence, on @ priori grounds, a
high value is more likely to be correct. Although in an absolute determination we
do not wish to lay too much stress on the point, we may draw attention to the fact
that the mean percentage difference from the mean in the case of our determinati
is considerably smaller than that of any of the other observers, a result which is
