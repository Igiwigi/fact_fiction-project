Now split
any finite tube of flow into an infinite number of such elementary tubes, call the sum
of the conductivities of the elementary tubes the whole conductivity of the finite tube,
and call the reciprocal of this last the whole resistance of the finite tube. We shall
then have that the mean of the values of — [SdpRK for the elementary tubes = the
whole resistance of the finite tube x the whole curreut along it. All this may, I
think, be said to be in complete agreement with the ordinary theory, but it serves to
call attention to the fact—important in connection with the longitudinal effect
mentioned in § 79 above—that anything which interferes with the ordinary lines of
flow will alter the apparent resistance.

we are now at liberty to say that the line

Equations (22) and (224) are easily seen to follow. Comparing, now, equations (20), (21), (22), (20a), (214), and (22a), with equations
