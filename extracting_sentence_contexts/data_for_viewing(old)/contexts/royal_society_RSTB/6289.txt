Lamarckiana ; and the offspring of the dwarf were practically all trisomic—a situation
which has never occurred before. In this connection it may be pointed out that the
senior author and others grew cultures of O. Lamarckiana and its relatives at Wood’s


234 R. RUGGLES GATES AND H. K. NANDI ON THE CYTOLOGY OF

Hole Laboratory 25 years ago, at a distance of a mile or two from where the
seeds of O. paralamarckiana were collected. There is thus the possibility that the
latter might be descended from natural crosses between the pollen of O. Lamarckiana
and the small-flowered wild local species. This, however, appears improbable.

Whether O. paralamarckiana is a hybrid of O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains
that it has survived under natural conditions at Penzance for a period of some
25 years, and therefore appears to be entitled to recognition as a wild species unless
it can be shown to be of hybrid origin. O. Lamarckiana has never been found wild
in America, except a small clump of plants found by the senior author in company
with Professor Martg-Vicrorin, at Lotbiniére in Quebec Province, October, 1932.
These plants were on the roadside by a cultivated field near a chateau with an
English garden, and had very probably escaped from there.

Although many attempts have been made, notably by Davis, to show that
O. Lamarckiana originated as a garden hybrid, yet there is no evidence that its status
as a species is different from that of other early species such as O. biennis and O.
grandiflora. Neither O. biennis nor O. Lamarckiana have hitherto been found truly
