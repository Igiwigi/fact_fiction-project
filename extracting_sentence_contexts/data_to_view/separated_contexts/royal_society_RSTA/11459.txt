HOUGH ON THE APPLICATION OF HARMONIC

and when /ig/4o*a* = 4,

ae = ‘7208P, — ‘0973P, + ‘0048P, — 0001P, +... The lunar-fortnightly declinational tides have been evaluated by Professor Darwin*
for depths which correspond with the first and third cases given above, the results
being expressed in series proceeding according to ascending powers of the variable p. If we replace the various powers of » by their values in terms of the zonal
harmonics,t we may deduce the following series from those given by Professor
Darwiy ; when hg/4o*%a? = -}5, we find

pte = ‘2889P, — -1755P, + -0490P, — 0079P, + 0009P,,—...,
0/* 2

while, when hg/4a*a* = +},

os = ‘5969P, — ‘1385P, + 0126P, — ‘0006P, +...
0 * 2

The difference between these expansions and those we have given above, is to be
explained by the fact that we have included in our analysis the effects due to the
attraction of the water on itself. I have re-computed the lunar-fortnightly tides,
starting with the assumption that p/o = 0, and obtained practically identical results
by the two methods. :

We see then that the effect of the gravitational attraction of the water is to diminish
the tides, as compared with the equilibrium tides, in the first case by about 8 per
cent., and in the second by about 5 per cent.
