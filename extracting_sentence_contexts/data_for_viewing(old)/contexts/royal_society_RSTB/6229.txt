Considerable technical difficulties have already been encountered in studying the
effect of different degrees of humidity upon flies which had never been fed, because
individual flies are so unlike one another in weight and in the proportion of water in
their bodies, Tables VIII, IX, and X. But if the flies are fed they become still
more different from one another, for some take more than their own weight of
blood within a few minutes, and others may not feed at all ; moreover, those which
have fed lose weight very rapidly so that 24 hours later many of them are prepared

to take another enormous meal ; the weight curve therefore fluctuates very rapidly
and widely, fig. 4. The facts given in Table XIV show some of the inherent
difficulties of the problem ; it gives wet and dry weights of Glossina tachinoides killed
four hours after feeding, flies which refused to feed having been excluded. If the
maxima and minima are compared, for either sex, and for wet or dry weights, the
ratio is almost two to one. The same thing is more appropriately measured by the
coefficients of variation which are about twice as great as in unfed flies, Tables IX,
X, and XI. It is therefore certain that it will be difficult to study the effect of
climatic factors upon flies which have fed. In the present paper no more can
be done than to present a series of notes.
