For conversion of metabolite concentrations between model (mol 1-1 cell water)
and data (mmol kg! dry weight), we assumed an intracellular water content of 31kg—! dry muscle
weight [27]. (c) Model prediction of the ATP synthesis time course at 100% (dashed line) and 2%
(dotted line) of normal CK activity at a workload of 40% of VOgmax. The forcing function of
pulsatile ATP hydrolysis is plotted as a solid line. Note that the last 2s of a simulation over 600s
are shown ensuring a steady state. (b) Dark grey, data; light grey, model prediction. (c) Dashed
line, ATP synthesis, 100% CK; dotted line, ATP synthesis, 2% CK; solid line, ATP hydrolysis.

predictions for PCr, Cr and ATP are relatively close to the measured values,
despite the fact that the kinetic parameters in the model were kept close to their
reported literature values by constraining them with their measurement error
using Bayesian priors. Phil. Trans.
