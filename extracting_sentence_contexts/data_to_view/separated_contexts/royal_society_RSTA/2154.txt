To prove this claim, choose (j1,j2) so that &(j1, ¢1,j2, €2;1) F 0(E (j, C1), €2;0))
for all (j/,,/5). If equidistribution held, then we would have

Cs(0,1,0, 1) ~ @*Cs(0, €1,0, £2)

for some a* > 0, which is false by our assumption that &(0, ¢1,0, €2) =0(€ (j1, €1,j2, €2)). This fact
allows us to prove that S does not have (¢1,¢2)-equidistribution in the cases not included in
theorem 1.10. The cases with x(S) < 0 require Theorem 15.1 in [5]. The most difficult case is where min{A(j1/1,j2/¢2)} = A(ji/l1,j2/l2) = A(0,0) for some
(j1,j2) # (0,0), where one must prove that the weight of Zs(cl, C337) is greater than that of
Zs(1,1;7).
