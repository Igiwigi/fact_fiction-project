Z game two tations in the three succeeding years 1846, 1847 and 1848, I have had the

# indicating the existence of a periodical variation, which, either from a causal con-
z nection (meaning thereby their being possibly joint effects of a common cause), or by
& a 8ingular coincidence, corresponds precisely both in period and epoch, with the
S variation in the frequency and magnitude of the solar spots, recently announced by
5 M. Scawas as the result of his systematic and long-continued observations. As
ES facts and collocations of this description are of particular interest at the present
A moment, from their bearing on inquiries in which physical philosophers are engaged,
I have deemed it better to communicate them at once, in the form of a second paper
on the disturbances of the Declination, than to await the completion of the investiga-
tion into the laws of the disturbances of the Inclination and of the Total Force, for
which I have not yet been able to command the necessary leisure. The method pursued in examining the laws of the Declination-disturbances in 1846,
1847 and 1848, is the same as that adopted for the three preceding years and described
in my former paper. The obseryations having been made hourly, every hourly ob-
servation which was found to differ by a certain prescribed amount* from the mean
value of the Declination in the same month and at the same hour was separated from
