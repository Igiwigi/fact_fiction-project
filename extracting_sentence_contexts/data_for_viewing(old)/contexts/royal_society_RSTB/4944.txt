DR. A. P. CHATTOCK ON THE PHYSICS OF INCUBATION. 439

Tn the later stages the live egg curves rise above those for dead eggs ; but this is due
partly to the growth of internal heat in the live eggs during the third week and partly
to the CO, they produce, the amount of this gas being then for the first time important,
as LAMson and Epmonp show.

Tt thus appears probable that a connection exists between hatching and the height of
the loss of weight curve in the early days of incubation, departure from A, A, corre-
sponding with failure to hatch. And this may perhaps find further illustration in the
fact that the percentages hatched in B and C are smaller as the distance from A, A,
increases, though this comparison, as already explained, is less dependable than one
between two curves belonging to the same hatch.

The effect is almost certainly one of enhanced evaporation due to rise of temperature
in the eggs, as is shown by the following account of the evidence there is for this view.

External conditions equal, the evaporation from an egg is determined by the average
temperature of its shell. To show that an increase in the loss of weight from an egg is
due to increased evaporation, it is therefore necessary to show that the loss varies with
this average temperature when the external conditions are constant.
