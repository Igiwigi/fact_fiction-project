'= 169. In geometry of two dimensions we have the plane as a space or locus in quo,
Syhich is considered under two distinct aspects, viz. as made up of points, and as made up
f lines. -The sevyeral points of the plane are determined by means of the point-coordinates
+4, 2), viz. attributing to these any specific values, or writing w, y, 2=a, 6, c, we have a
-articular point of the plane; and in like manner the seyeral lines of the plane are
Aetermined by the line-coordinates (E, x, £), viz. attributing to these any specific values,
Sr writing &, 7, Z=«, 3, y, we have a particular line of the plane. And we may say that
Ihe plane is the /ocus in guo of the point-coordinates (&, y, 2), and of the line-coordinates
3x, n,%). It is not necessary to consider separately the analytical theories of point-coor-
Ainates and of line-coordinates; for the theory of the former in relation to points and
Jines respectively is identical with the theory of the latter in relation to lines and points
Hespectively; but it is necessary to show how either system of coordinates, say the system
Sf point-coordinates, is applicable to both points and lines, or in fact all loci whatever,
nd to explain the mutual relation of the two systems of coordinates.
2 170. Considering then point-coordinates, the equations

E a, y, 2=4, b, c,
Aetermine, as already mentioned, a point.

A linear equation,
(*Lz, y, 2 =0,

determines a line, viz. the line which is the locus of all the points, the coordinates of
which satisfy this equation. And in like manner an equation
