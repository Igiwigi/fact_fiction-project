one that initially was not facilitated by language at all.

Second, this context must have been one in which alterna-
tive outcomes of the involved individualsâ€™ behaviour had
consequences for their fitness, and this context had to recur
ona frequent basis, in the lives of many, and over multiple gen-
erations. In order to drive evolutionary change that would give
rise to language, these outcomes must have been influenced by
the extent to which communication between the individuals
was successful.

Third, the context we seek is one in which the interests of the
involved individuals are largely aligned. This stems from the fact
that language does not have an inherent mechanism that assures
honest signalling [44], and it seems highly unlikely that such an
elaborate communication system, which is demanding of all
individuals involved, and which has the potential to be easily
used for deception, would evolve outside of a context in which
all involved stand to benefit greatly from successful communi-
cation and transfer of knowledge. Although not exclusively, a
situation in which most communicators are kin seems the
most likely in this context [54-56].

Finally, although not absolutely necessary, it seems reason-
able to assume that the context that gave rise to language, given
