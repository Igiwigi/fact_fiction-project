a different shape, being nearly cubic. And it is possible, that
the hexagonal crystals may owe their figure to a small por-
tion of alkali remaining in combination. 'From the ready disposition of this substance to unite with
both acids and alkalies, it would appear to be an oxide; and
that it does, in fact, contain oxygen, is proved by the forma-
tion of carbonic acid in distillation. The quantity of oxygen
present in the calculus is not, however, sutlicient to give it
acid properties, for it has no effect on paper coloured with
litmus. I am therefore inclined to consider it as an oxide; and
.since both the calculi that have yet been observed have been
taken frum the bladder.
