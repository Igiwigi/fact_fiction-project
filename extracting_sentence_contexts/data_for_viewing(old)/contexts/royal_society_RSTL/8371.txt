to say deep, as the fibula is widened from before backwards) distal extremity (Plate
XXXV. fig. 3) is shaped on the same pattern as in the Suidz, presenting a more uniform
arched and slightly raised platform pressed against the astragalus, and not a deep semi-
circular notch as in Ruminantia. (In these the shaft of the fibula is generally mostly
reduced to a mere tendon, but its lower extremity remains under the name of the s0-
called © os82let peroneen.”) The articular end for the calcaneum (fig. 7') presents a very

Z the posterior concave.
