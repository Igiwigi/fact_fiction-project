arbitrarily small.{

We now investigate the circumstances under which the inequality (60) has, or has not,
infinitely many solutions. For this we need to quote one further result (Koksma 1936),
namely, that if @ is any irrational number which is not equivalent§ to any of 7, 45, ..., then
there are, for any ¢>0, infinitely many pairs of integers u, v (v>0) for which

| (u—Ov) v] <4+e. (63)

+ For references, see Koksma (1936, Kap. m, § 2). A comparatively simple proof of Markoff’s theorem
is given in Cassels (1949).

t For the fact that Q,,(u, v) assumes both 1 and —1, see, for example, Dickson (1930, last clause of theorem
74). The rest of our assertion follows by the classical theory of the periodic chain of reduced forms equivalent
to a given form.

§ Two irrational numbers 4, @’ are said to be equivalent if 6 = (a0’+b)/(c0’+d), where a, 6, c, d are
integers with ad—be = +1; or, what is the same thing, if the continued fractions for and 6’ have the same
‘tails’. It is known that @, and ¢, in (61) are equivalent.

This is a classical result, and is proved by Markoff’s methods, based on the theory of con-
tinued fractions.
