as at Marnhull and Todber, Sturminster Newton and Osmington. Those who have in
the past correlated the coral rag of Steeple Ashton with that farther N., besides over-
looking the stratigraphical discrepancy, failed to remark the fact that at Steeple Ashton
the corals belong to a wider range of species and are in a different state of preservation.

From this it may be seen that we must seek the equivalent of the Berkshire Oolites
in Dorset beneath the Osmington Oolite Series; and we are not disappointed. The
large Trigonie of the perlata-hudlestoni type, which form so conspicuous a feature in
Berkshire, occur in the topmost bed of the Nothe Grits of the Weymouth district. This
bed is best studied at Redcliff, near Preston, whence Mr. Buckman has named it the
Preston Grit ; but for the sake of uniformity I suggest that its name should give some
indication of the importance of its contents, and I therefore refer to it as the Trigonia
perlata Limestone. It forms a prominent band, 6 ft. in thickness, of massive, gritty,
shelly, fucoidal limestone, bearing a close resemblance but for the fucoid markings to
the brownish-grey, gritty, shelly, speckled, but doubtfully oolitic Trigonia perlata
