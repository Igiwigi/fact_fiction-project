Gender, in con-
trast, had no significant effect on the volume of either form of
interaction. Physical distance did show a small inverse effect
on F2F interaction (Model 2): the nearer the two workstations,
the more F2F interaction. This effect was notable both for its
small size relative to the size of the effect of the open office
and for the fact that it was limited to F2F interaction (not
email). We investigate this in further detail next.

(ii) The effect of physical distance on F2F versus email findings from electronic interaction data. Our finding that
Model 2 of table 2 shows that the effect of physical distance on changes in workplace design affect electronic and F2F
F2F interaction is small—and the effect on email insignificant— interaction networks differently (and, on some measures, in
relative to that of openness.
