salts over that without them be assumed to represent the amount derived from them,
it would result that about 274 per cent. of the nitrogen of the ammonia-salts was
recovered, whilst only about 18 per cent. of that of the farmyard manure was recovered.
It, should be observed, however, that much more than 274 per cent. of the nitrogen of
ammonia-salts, or of nitrate of 8o0da, is estimated to be recovered when these were
employed in conjunction with an annual supply of soluble artificial mineral manures,

There is thus, here, further evidence of the much less effect of a given amount of
nitrogen supplied in farmyard manure than as ammonia-salts. Tt is also clear that,
although the application of the ammonia-salts was the means of turning to account
some of the accumulated residue of the mineral constituents supplied in the dung, the
limit of the immediately available supply was very s00n reached, the remainder be-
coming less and less rapidly recoverable. It was, in fact, retained in a condition 80
slowly available as to be of but little effect in increasing immediate crops, and therefore
of but little practical value, except as a storehouse against exhaustion.

So far, the produce of the first crops only, of each year, has been taken into account.
As already explained (pp. 7 and 8), the second crops were, as a rule, fed off by sheep,
having no other food, that they might contribute nothing in their manure that they had
not derived from the land; whilst, having no other food, they sometimes even lost weight,
especially in bad weather. They would, therefore, generally retain but little, and
gometimes none ab all, of either the nitrogen or the mineral constituents of the grass
they consumed ; and they might even sometimes themselves lose something. On this
