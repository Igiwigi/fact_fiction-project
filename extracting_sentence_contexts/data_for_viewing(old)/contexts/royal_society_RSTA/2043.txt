By analogy with work [13], we will call function g 4(f) a memory function.
Along with function ¢ ,(f), we will consider also function y,(f), which is defined as

Ww(H=eaha’ -1 (3.13)

The properties of these functions are given in appendix A (d). For example, property 2 says
that g(t) > A” and w,(t) > 0as t ov. This fact suggests the existence of a steady-state solution
under condition of the existence of the finite limit of the function C(t) as t > 00.

Using expression (3.13) for evaluating the right-hand side of equation (3.12) gives

Laplace transform of the function w, (t) can be obtained by using property 1 from appendix A (d),
