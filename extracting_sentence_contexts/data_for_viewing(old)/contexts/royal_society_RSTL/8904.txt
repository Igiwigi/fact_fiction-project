once round the latter. Tt is comparatively rare to find cases in which contractile waves
continue to pass after the spiral incision has been carried twice round this organ ; and
it is still more rare to find cases of waves passing in specimens such as that represented in
Plate 33, where the spiral section has made two and a half turns round the gonocalyx.
When such cases as the latter do occur, if the specimen happens to be an ordinary-sized
one, the contractile strip will be about a yard in length. On the other hand, cages may
occur in which blocking of the contractile wave supervenes when the contractile strip
is only an inch long; and in one case complete blocking of this wave was caused by the
radial incision half an inch long, made on one side of a freely discharging lithocyst,
7. e. before the circumferential incision was begun at all. But snch extreme variations
upon the side of intolerance of spiral section are as uncommon as are the extreme
variations upon the side of tolerance. Now the fact that between these two extremes
there are to be found all possible grades of tolerance, appears to warrant us in concluding
that the contractile tissue of Aurelia aurita is not of a functionally homogeneous
nature.

And this conclusion is very much strengthened by the additional fact that at
whatever point in a contractile strip which is being progressively elongated by section
the contractile wave becomes blocked, the blocking is sure to take place completely and

Â© exclusively at that point. This fact, it appears to me, can only be properly explained
by supposing that more or less differentiated lines of discharge pervade the contractile
tissue of the gonocalyx, and that the sudden and complete blocking of the contractile
waves which invariably takes place at some determinate point during the progress of
