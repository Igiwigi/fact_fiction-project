Moreover, there are certain population changes during a decline in ruffed grouse which are
probably not caused by the disappearance of hares. Clarke (1936) reports a typically
high proportion of old birds in declining populations, and King (1937) states, but without
giving his data, that these older birds furnish the breeding stock responsible for the next
recovery. In fact the decline in ruffed grouse, and also in bobwhite quail, Colinus virgin-
ianus (Errington 1945), is similar to that in the snowshoe hare in being spread out over
several years after a period of fairly stationary numbers. The view that the ruffed grouse -
cycle is due to an intraspecific process is, of course, implicit in Errington’s general con-
clusion (1946) that ‘intraspecific self-limiting mechanisms basically determine the popula-
tion levels...’. It is not impossible that these mechanisms may be essentially similar in
both hare and grouse.
