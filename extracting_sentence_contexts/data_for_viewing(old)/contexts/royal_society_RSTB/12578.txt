Despite the fact that the sequence is the same, i.e. it is NP V (there are many pictures the cause) z

structure. Many empirical tests support this conclusion, for (many pictures are the cause)
example, the following contrast: d_ La causa sono [molte foto t].

b * Which wall do you think that the cause of the riot was
a picture of t?

There are two logical possibilities to explain these facts: either =>
something is required in that higher position that attracts 5
either NP—as assumed by the so-called ‘Extended Projection ==
Principle’ based theories, corresponding to the standard &
theory [19]—or rather something must be avoided in the
lower one that expels either NP. That the first hypothesis =
must be excluded is proved by cases like (14)a-b showing >
that raising is also obligatory in those languages where &

More generally, a subset of the set of copular sentences of the
type NP V NP allows this symmetric alternation. The expla-
nation of this and many other contrasts is based on the
hypothesis that, along with the canonical structure where
