Section IlN.â€”Changes experienced by certain Nitroprussides when their solutions
are heated or kept.

18. Several of the nitroprussides, especially nitroprussic acid, nitroprussides of
ammonium, barium and calcium, deposit either prussian blue or oxide of iron when
their solutions are heated or are kept for some time. The residual liquid, after evapo-
ration, yields crystals of the same shape and exactly of the same properties as before.
Analysis however shows that some change has resulted in their composition, for the
iron or electro-negative metal is now in greater than atomic proportion to the electro-
positive metal. The proportion of carbon is also s0mewhat different. Still the differ-
ence in composition is not yery considerable, although decidedly marked ; it is not
however sufficient to cause any obvious alteration in their general properties. In
fact, there is an attached impurity, probably a cyanide of iron, which cannot now be
removed by crystallization, precipitation, digestion with nitric acid, or any of the
ordinary means of purification. This impurity, if it be one, remains 80 obstinately
attached that all methods of purification have quite failed to remove it. This cireum-
stance, before it was understood, had thrown the greatest difficulties in the way of
the inquiry, and protracted it to a most tedious length by preventing the attainment
of accordant results. It is to prevent the like inconvenience to those who repeat these
experiments that this section of the paper is specially devoted. Attention has pre-
viously been drawn to the fact, that the nitroprussides form chemical compounds
with the cyanides of iron. This seems to be a case of the same kind, but of more
ultimate union. The impurity or chemically attached cyanide in this case appears
to be Fe Cy,, or perhaps Fe Cy+H Cy, judging from analysis only, for its separation
has not been accomplished. The proportion in which it is present is very small,
