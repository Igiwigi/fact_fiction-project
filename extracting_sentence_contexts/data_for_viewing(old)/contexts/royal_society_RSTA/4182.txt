depends on how p(k) is embedded in the space of density operators. However, this is true only
if the eigenstates satisfy the parallelism condition (5.2). If this condition is not met, we need to
phase-shift the eigenstates as follows:

|uj(k)) > |uj(k)yen Lol HD) (6.4)

Clearly, the interferometric geometric phase reduces to the Berry phase if p(k) is a curve of pure
states.

The Berry phase for a cyclically evolving pure state equals half of the solid angle enclosed
by the curve traced out by the stateâ€™s Bloch vector on the Bloch sphere. Using this observation,
it is fairly easy to calculate the interferometric phase for cyclically evolving qubits, provided
they do not pass the maximally mixed state. In fact, we believe that the parallelism condition
in equation (5.2) cannot be extended to include all curves that pass through the maximally mixed
state. However, this is still under investigation.


Figure 6. The nodes of the interferometric phase are situated on the radial segment opposite to the initial state. No build-up
of the phase occurs before and after the passage of a node. If the curve passes the line of nodes, the phase makes a sudden
gc-jump.

Consider a closed curve of mixed qubits
p(k) = pr lk) |e (k)) (er (K)| + pa(k) atk) (ua(k), (O<k <x), (6.5)

and assume that the eigenvectors |u;(k)) satisfy the parallelism condition (5.2). Let R(k) be the
