in [3], we argued that bistability and localization lie at the heart of mathematical models
that explain cell polarity, cellular morphogenesis and movement, and also rainforest-savana
transitions.

A central theme of this paper and its predecessor [1] has been that of universality of bifurcation
structures in a class of reactionâ€”diffusion models in one spatial dimension. Starting from the
assumption of simple cubic autocatalytic nonlinearity, we seem to have found there are two
broad cases: Schnakenberg-like, where there is a unique homogeneous equilibrium; and Gray-
Scott-like, where there is bistability between competing high- and low-intensity states. However,
it seems that any universality is not just due to the particularly simple functional form. In fact, the
Schnakenberg-like universality was first identified in [12] for a generalization of a wave-pinning
model of cell polarity [31,32] and a model for crime-wave hotspots [33]. We have also found
similar structures in models of similar bifurcations of predatory-prey systems [24,25]. Similar
structures have also been observed in models of desertification [34,35].

This paper has attempted to illustrate one of the simplest extensions to the kind of models
studied in [1], namely the inclusion of a cusp bifurcation leading to regions of bistability between
branches of homogeneous steady states. At least for the Gray-Scott and Gierer-Meinhardt


models, we found significant additional complexity, involving various codimension-two
bifurcations of peak-like and hole-like localized states. Given this complexity, it would seem
