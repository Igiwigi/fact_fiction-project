this quantity it was possible to obtain from Dogs. When four litres or more of blood
are wanted ib becomes practically impossble to use Dog's blood, and 80 some othas
had to be selected. After several trials Calf's blood was chosen. This blood, how- _

ever, nourishes the heart less satisfactorily, and hence the earlier indications of _ |
commencing death.

With respect to the choice of blood I add a few words which may be of aid to any
one desirous to repeat my experiments. It is important to have it from quite young
Calves ; that is to say, from animals which are still suckling : a point of itself of 80me
interes6 when considered in connexion with the well known fact that the chemical
composition of the urine of the nurslings of Herbivora shows that their nutritional
processes agree in the main with those of adult Carnivora, and difter essentially from
those of the adults of their own species. In spite of all care I used to be frequently
disappointed by the death of the isolated heart before any satisfactory number of
observations could be carried out upon it, even in cases when I could think of no
cause for the failure. Light broke upon me when the laboratory attendant, whose
duty it was to bring the blood from the slaughter-house, remarked one day that it
seemed to him that we nearly always got on better when he did not get the blood
from © wharf calves.” On questioning, I found that © wharf calves” was the term
employed by Baltimore butchers to indicate animals which, though still young enough
to yield veal, were of such age that they had long ceased to live on milk. Since the
blood of such Calves has been rejected the percentage of failures has considerably
