The alveolar edge of the mandible is polished,
bearing about sixteen teeth as long as the number is complete; but (as in the maxil-
lary) the teeth are gradually lost from the front backwards, and there is, corresponding
to the remaining anterior maxillary tooth, a very shallow and long concavity scooped out
by the vertical and horizontal action of this tooth. The toothed, or rather serrated
hinder portion of the dentary fits closely between the maxillary and palatine series. Dentition of young examples. â€”I have mentioned above that the upper incisors of a
full-grown example are notched; this is explained by the remarkable circumstance that
each is, in fact, composed of two teeth, which are conical and perfectly distinct in young
examples about 7 inches long (figs. 10: & 11). Also the incisors of the lower jaw are
separate to their base, and the lateral canine tooth is s0mewhat removed from them. The other mandibulary, maxillary, and palatine teeth do not differ peculiarly from those
of older examples.
