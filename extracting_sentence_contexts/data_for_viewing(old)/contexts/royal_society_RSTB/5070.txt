aspect a sharp medial ridge, which terminates in a somewhat flattened pyramidal
projection immediately dorsal to the foramen magnum. Behind, below, and on the
medial side of each auditory capsule, the plewroccipitalia, which arise from the
ex-occipital region of the parachordal plate, by coming into contact with the
posterior tragus of the auditory capsule, have completed dorsally the periphery of
the elongated foramen jugulare. The basal portion of each pleuroccipital cartilage,
immediately ventral to the posterior boundary of the foramen jugulare, is perforated

by three foramina, serially arranged in an antero-posterior direction, through which
emerge the roots of Nerve XII. The fact that at Stage P there are four foramina,
transmitting five nerve roots, has already been noted. In Stage 8 the condition
observed is the same as in Stage R, but in adult Sphenodon two foramina only have
been found by Howes and Swinnerton (1901).

On the ventral surface of the parachordal cartilage there is, in this region, a decided
thickening and incipient ossification, which extends outwards from a single centre
and is evidently the developing medio-ventral basioccipital bone. Opening into
the antero-lateral region of the foramen jugulare is a conspicuous circular foramen
which penetrates the postero-medial wall of the auditory capsule. This is the
foramen rotundum, which transmits the saccus perilymphaticus and the vena
cochlearis. Both the foramen jugulare and the foramen rotundum ure conspicuous
in embryos of Stage 8 and are present in adult Sphenodon, although the former
