amples of al7 the parts of the animal, Carcass and Offal together, the wool only excepted;
the fat in the wool itself being extracted separately, and its amount taken into the cal-
mation. A glance at the two columns (5 and 6) will show that there is never half, and
in only one or two cases, one-fourth of 1 per cent. of variation between the results
Â»btained by the two different methods.

The striking fact appears, that, of the whole body (fasted live-weight), 453 per cent. of
the very fat Sheep, and 42 per cent. of the moderately fat Pig, were dry fatty matter.
Of the moderately fat Sheep 354 per cent., of the moderately fat Bullock 30 per cent.,
and of the fat Lamb 284 per cent. were dry fat. The half-fat old Sheep contained 232,

d the half-fat Bullock 18+ per cent. of fat. The sfore Sheep even contained 182, and

She store Pig 23 per cent. Of the Calf, on the other hand, the entire body, though
rofessedly fat, yielded only 145 per cent. of its weight of dry fatty substance.
