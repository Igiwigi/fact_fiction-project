(CuILp, 1927) and Molgula robusta (Lucas, 1927) the observations are original.

In reality the ampullz possess the double function of fixation and respiration, though
the latter seems to be the more important.

Most swimming tadpoles possess three anterior adhesive papillee, which stick to any
solid structure they meet. The adhesiveness, however, is associated with the general
surface of the tadpole and one not infrequently finds the latter attached by the tip
of the tail, though the anterior end is the more usual region. In any case the fixation
brought about by this adhesive property is but temporary, and permanent fixation is
made by the extensions of the larval test, initiated by the outgrowing ampulle. Thus
the test pushed out by the ampulle adheres firmly to the substratum and remains as
the organ of attachment after the ampulle have dwindled and disappeared. In fact,
