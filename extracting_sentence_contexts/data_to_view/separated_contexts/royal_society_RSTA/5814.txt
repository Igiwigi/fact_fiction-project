Tnmarg iS the :3
kinetic energy of a fictitious closed quantum system acted upon by scalar and vector potentials Pe
€(R,t) and Aj(R,t) (defined below). In other words, it is simply the kinetic energy one would :s
write down if one were given the Schrédinger equation (1.2) but not told it describes only one [3
component of a two-component system. Since x is the marginal probability amplitude for the :s
nuclear component of a system of electrons and nuclei, we call Tnmarg the marginal nuclear kinetic [8
energy. :s
The closed system described by equation (1.2) reproduces the true N,-body density and N;,- +8
body current density of the nuclear subsystem, but it is fictitious in the sense that off-diagonal
elements of the nuclear density matrix and hence non-local observables of the nuclear subsystem
cannot be calculated directly from the wave function x(R,t). A prime example is the true nuclear
kinetic energy as obtained from the full wave function |¥(t)) which obeys the identity [5,6]
