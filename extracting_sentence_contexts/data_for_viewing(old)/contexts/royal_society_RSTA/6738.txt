quite linear with 1/7, and we have obtained Lj from the curve at various temperatures and
plotted these in figure 12. Extrapolation to the melting-point gives a value of Lj in good
agreement with that obtained calorimetrically by Spaght, Thomas & Parks (1932), but
higher than the other values recorded in the literature. The difference in specific heats
between liquid and solid diphenyl] at the melting-point which can be obtained from figure 12
agrees with the value 8-7 cal./deg./mole obtained by Spaght eÂ¢ al. (1932). The fact that the
values of aj obtained by Warner et al. are higher than ours, in spite of the agreement on X},
arises from the fact that they have used a lower value of Lj in their calculations.
