It would certainly be of interest to pursue this study for substantially
higher numerical resolution at small scale, leading to higher Reynolds numbers Re, in order to
investigate the role small scales play in the development of inverse cascades in that case. For
example, does the k~? inverse scaling of Hjyy,c persist at high Re in Hall- MHD?

(b) Exact laws in the presence of helicity

A conservation law, such as that of kinetic energy, is a global volume-integrated property of non-
dissipative physics. These laws are in fact rather constraining in the sense that they are valid, in
Fourier space, for each individual (but isolated) triad. They also lead, under a suite of hypotheses
(homogeneity, isotropy, stationarity, and non-zero dissipation in the limit of high Reynolds
number), to an exact relationship linking third-order structure functions to the kinetic energy
dissipation rate ey and the spatial distance r between two points. In the simplest (incompressible)
case, this leads to the Kolmogorov 4/5th law [81]; with du(r) = u(x + r) — u(x), and with uy the
longitudinal component of the velocity (along 1), it is written as (suz(r)>) = —(4/5)evr.
