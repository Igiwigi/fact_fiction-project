AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE WANDERING CELLS OF THE FROG. 283

‘od a Mammal has only one kind of wandering cell. These facts suggest two

ering cell, that the different forms found in the more complex animals must be
arded as distinct from one another in their development and life history, even if
y be regarded as having a common origin ; and, secondly, that, corresponding with
s divergence and fixity of type, there must be divergence and fixity of function.

parity of form by comparing the behaviour of the different kinds of wandering
