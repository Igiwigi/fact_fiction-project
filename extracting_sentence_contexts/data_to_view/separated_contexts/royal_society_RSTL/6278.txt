Both the quartz rock and the schist of the island are intersected by three great green-
stone dykes (of inconsiderable thickness, however), none of them interfering with our
range, and by one or more great faults, all of which run through nearly the whole island

of which may be seen as cutting through our line of range at. f, g, &, 1, in Plate XX,
Section II. At a short distance behind the quarry cliff, and seat of our several explosions, a great,
clay dyke occurs in the quartz rock—a wall, in fact, of about 20 feet in average thick-
ness, running in the direction marked on the Map (Plate XX.), and with a dip of only
about 20® from the vertical. This consists of strongly compacted clay, nearly pure.

rock, though continually passing into stony masses. Lying as it does in rear of our expe-
rimental headings, it was of some value, as presenting a dead solid anvil to the pulse
from each explosion, in the contrary direction to that of the observed wave of impulse,
and hence causing a larger and more distinctly appreciable wave to be transmitted in the
direction towards the seismoscope.
