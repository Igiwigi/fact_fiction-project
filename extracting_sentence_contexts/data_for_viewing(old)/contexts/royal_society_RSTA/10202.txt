The values calculated from these expressions and the differences from observed
values are also given in the tables. If I, be the value of I, at infinite dilution (see
Tables XIII. and XIV.), and we put AI, = L, —I,, the expressions may be written

for KCl . . . . . . An/m=0:01048—0:0001845 AI,,
forNaCl . . . . . . An/m = 0:01054—0:0001271 AI,.

* For KCl, DINKHAUSER gives the value 9°80 for m = 1:234 (p. 1020) and the same value for m = 1
(p. 1025). The whole series shows that the latter value must be inaccurate. For m = 0°812 he gives the
value 10:06 (p. 1020) and for m = 0°5 the value 10:05. The former of these values is rejected. The
values for concentrations less than one-fiftieth normal are also rejected, since the large factor by which the
observed value of n must be multiplied to get the equivalent refractive power greatly magnifies any error.
These discrepancies are partly due to the fact that DINKHAUSER has combined his own results with those
of other observers.
