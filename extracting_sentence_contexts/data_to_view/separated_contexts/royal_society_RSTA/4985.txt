Moreover, the splinter cracks enter the tension zone between frames 4 and 5. This
leads to the initiation of the catastrophic failure of the glass, with the process of fracture being
propagated and controlled by the tensile stress present in the glass. In fact, from frame 5 to 12 the
fracture spreads almost throughout the glass block, showing repeated crack bifurcation. Note that
this crack propagation behaviour is quite different from the particle-impact-generated fracture
behaviour in stress-free blocks of soda-lime glass.

5. Discussion

In this work, several aspects of dynamic crack initiation and propagation in inorganic glasses
due to small-particle impact have been examined experimentally using high-speed framing
photography.
