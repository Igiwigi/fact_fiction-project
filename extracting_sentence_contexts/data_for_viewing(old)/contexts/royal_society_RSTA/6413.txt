from the plasma frequency wp. This trend can be seen particularly well for the more strongly
coupled case of r; = 20, where the true AF;(q) has a negative slope for small q; in contrast, the
quasi-particle approximation Fap(q, t) exhibits the opposite behaviour for both depicted values
of tr.

The full RPA is represented by the dotted red curves in figure 11. It is exact in the limits
of both q > 0 and q > qr, and represents a substantial improvement over the simple quasi-particle
ansatz in between. For rs = 4, the RPA performs comparably well over the entire q-range, with a
maximum relative error around intermediate wavenumbers q ~ 2qr. In addition, we note that


the r-decay measure within the RPA is more accurate for t = 6/10 than for t = f/2. This can be
explained by the fact that while the SSF S(q) = F(q,0) in the RPA exhibits systematic errors for
intermediate q (see figure 6), it does attain the correct first derivative given by the well-known f-
sum rule (equation (2.18)). For rs = 20, the qualitative accuracy of the RPA noticeably deteriorates
as electron-electron exchange-correlation effects become more important. In particular, the RPA,
too, does not reproduce the negative slope of the exact PIMC data for AF;(q) for small q. This is
consistent with the inability of the RPA to capture the roton minimum in the dispersion relation
of the DSF, which has been investigated in detail in references [66,97].

This systematic shortcoming of the mean-field-based RPA is remedied by including exact
PIMC results for the static local field correction via equation (2.10), and the results for AF;(q) are
shown as the dash-dotted black curve in figure 11. For a metallic density of rs; = 4, no systematic
deviations between the static approximation and the PIMC reference results can be resolved on
the depicted scale. For the electron liquid at r; = 20, too, we find that including the static local field
