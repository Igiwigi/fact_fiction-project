Figure 12. Difference of land-cover fractions between 2100 and 2010 from the GCAM, IMAGE, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM and REMIND-
MAgPIE IAMs grouped by land-cover type for 1.5Â°C of global warming and SSP2 scenario. Grid cells are masked if the land-cover
fraction is less than or equal to 19. The values are displayed as differences in fractional areas (unitless).

warming scenarios by 2100 are also displayed (electronic supplementary material, figures S19-
$21). Some further systematic differences are found. For instance, the IMAGE model tends to
include more forest cover in high latitudes, independently of the considered scenario. GLOBIOM
on the other hand includes very little grassland.

Overall, the analyses show that each model has distinctive characteristics with respect to
land-use allocation and that the inter-IAM spread is substantial, both with respect to static
maps, as well as with respect to changes over the course of the twenty-first century. Some of
these differences reflect the fact that global land allocation for and the distribution of dedicated
bioenergy plantations (with or without combination with carbon capture and storage (CCS)) in
IAMs for a fixed level of carbon sequestration by 2050 or 2100 highly depends on assumptions
being made on socio-economic, climate and environmental policy as well as technological
developments [49]. Thereby, less or more land might be needed in IAMs to fulfil a certain climate
target. In addition, differences in observational data used as input to the models also probably
play a role [50].

These differences in IAMs for resulting LUCs corresponding to the same SSP and climate
scenarios reveal an additional dimension of uncertainty that has not been considered in multi-
model projections so far. Indeed, biogeophysical processes associated with the respective land
