the dorsal sac. They then pass upwards, one on each side of the pineal gland, near
its hinder margin, and open into the sinus longitudinalis just where the latter parts
company with the pineal gland. These veins are in intimate contact with the walls
of the pineal gland throughout the upper part of their course, in fact they lie
beneath the investing pia, and no doubt convey venous blood from the hinder part
of the pineal gland to the s¢nus longitudinalis. 4. Vene bigeminales superiores (fig. 1, v.b.s.).—A group of large veins (five in the

up to open into the sinus longitudinalis close to one another and close to the
parapineal veins.
