On the other hand, one most important function of this
investment seems to be indicated in the following facts. SPALLaNzani found that
ova of-the Frog deprived of their envelopes before contact with the male influence,
were not impregnated ; and further, that ova taken directly from the ovaria, are not
susceptible of impregnation. A remarkable fact which I noticed, at a time when I was not fully aware of its
interest and importance, enables me to confirm this observation. I captured a pair
of frogs, the female of which, a short time after they were in my possession, had a
large hernia formed by a protrusion of part of the great oviduct through an acci-
dental wound in the posterior part of the right side of the body, and in consequence
of which she was unable to deposit her ova. This wound had been received before
the union of the sexes, but the hernia was formed afterwards, during the passing of
the ova from the ovaria.
