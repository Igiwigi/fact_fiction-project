Figure 1. Identification and characterization of Padi2 isoform expression. (a) Schematic illustration of Padi2a and Padi2£ transcripts identified by RNA sequencing
and PCR walking, highlighting exons (boxes) and introns (lines). Padi2G transcription is initiated downstream within an intronic region, generating a significantly
truncated mRNA and protein. (b) Sequencing and epigenetic profiling of Padi2 chromatin in primary oligodendrocytes [26] uncovers an accessible intronic promoter
tegion (bound by CTCF and enriched for H3K27ac and H3K4me3) upstream of exon 7 in the Padi2 gene, corresponding to the Padi2G transcription start site (TSS).
(q Simplified diagram of the PADI2 protein structures to illustrate the lack of the PAD_N and parts of PAD_M domains in PADI2§ (right), with three-dimensional
models underneath. Representative protein structures illustrating the differences between the two PADI2 protein isoforms are shown based on AlphaFold’s PADI2a
prediction. (d) Schematic of FACS strategy for oligodendrocyte populations. The Pdgfra-Cre-RCE:loxP-GFP-loxP reporter mouse labels oligodendrocyte precursors (P4)
(GFP+) as well as juvenile (P21) and adult (P60) GFP + but CD140a-negative oligodendrocytes. (e) mRNA expression of Padi2G in the oligodendrocyte populations
described in (h). Padi2B levels increase with oligodendrocyte differentiation, corresponding to increased expression of the oligodendrocyte differentiation marker
Mog, (n= 4). Data are represented as mean +s.d.; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, #p < 0.0001 using multiple unpaired t-test.
