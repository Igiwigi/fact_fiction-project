hepatic veins. PoviiLeT and MuLLEr had already failed to obtain any effect by in-
serting the electrodes into corresponding arteries and veins*. Not only were we
looking in the wrong quarter for our current, but we now find that the arterial and
venous blood are both in the same electric state, and thus accounting for our
failures.

In the following experiments a resistance was added to the circuit. A glass tube,

* We do not deny, but think it highly probable, that with delicate galvanometers some effect might occur.
Assuming that a light effect were obtained, it would then become a question whether the effects were not due
to the changes which occur at the electrodes, rather than at the points of nutrition or secretion. The physical
philosopher has an undoubted right to call upon the physiologist to point out the anion and cation in his cir-
cuit, or some adequate cause for the current. The fact is, the vagueness associated with the term current has
misled physiologists. We are firmly convinced, that, without extreme care, a delicate galvanometer would only
lead to confusion ; there is no difficulty in obtaining an effect upon the needle; if anything, we obtain more
than we want : the great point is to account for it when obtained, 7. e, to show with what class of phenomena
the effects may be referred.
