I was at this time studying
the development of Pisidium and Limarz, and obtained evidence of the invagination of
the primitive blastosphere in those two widely separated mollusks. Subsequently at
Naples I found the same process occurring in Nudibranchs. The probable identity of
this process of invagination with that 80 well known in the Batrachians, especially
through STRICKER's admirable work on the 8ubject, became clear, to those occupied with
embryological studies, from the facts establighed by KowaLgvsky ; and the © anus of
Rvscox1 ” could now be recognized in the * orifice of invagination ” present in members
of the three large groups of Vermes, Mollusca, and Vertebrata. The embryonic form produced by this invagination-process is a simple sac, composed
of an ectoderm and endoderm, with an orifice connecting the exterior with the cavity
lined by the endoderm. Tt, in short, presents the typical structure of the simplest
Ccelenterata, and corresponds exactly with the 80-called Planula of the polyps and
corals.
