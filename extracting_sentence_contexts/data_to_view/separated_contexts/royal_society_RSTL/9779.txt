Q the firs place, it is clear thab the nerve cannot be considered as the motor nerve of
>the muscle in the sense in which the words motor nerve are ordinarily used. The
;Z nerve itself cannot upon stimulation cause a contraction of the cardiac muscle ; but
SE causes 8uch a modification in the chemical processes going on in the muscle as to
£ modify the force of the contractions which take place when the impulses from the
Emotor ganglia reach the muscle. In fact, two distinct processes are going on—the one,
Smotor, represented by the impulses from the motor ganglia, and corresponding to the
Z blow by which snch an explosive substance as nitro-glycerine, for instance, is exploded ;
= the other, trophic, represented by the action of the vagus upon the muscular sub-
B 8tance, and corresponding to something affecting the nature or properties of the
Sexploaive substance itself.
'> The problem, then, to be explained is, what conception can be formed of the nature
= of the changes caused in the muscle by the action of the nerve, which shall satisfy the
2 conditions that the same nerve can produce in different cases a graduated series of
= different effects extending from a simple increase in the force of the contractions on
E S'the one side down to diminution of force even to complete standstill on the other ? In trying to form a theory to explain new facts, it is always advisable to see if any
& theory which has been devised to explain somewhat similar facts will apply to this case
D also., With this consideration 1 cannot help thinking that the recent views which
Z have been put forward to explain the changes going on in gland cells in a condition of
rest and activity may help in the conception of the changes going on in the cardiac
8 muscle cells under the influence of such a nerve as the vagus. In all secretory glands it
appears to be the fact that the formation of the ultimate products of secretion is a
gradual process, three stages of which can be recognised, viz. : the growth of the proto-
plasm, the formation of zymogen from the protoplasm, and the formation of the ultimate
products from the zymogen ; and according to LANGLEY* these three processes not only
go on at the same time, but als» there may be, under different cireumstances, a dif-
ference in the relative rates ab which they proceed.
