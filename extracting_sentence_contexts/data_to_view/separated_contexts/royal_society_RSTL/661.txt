The blood also which passed to the lungs,
must have been again conveyed to the heart sooner, from the
Shortness of its circuit; and must have entered the heart with
a quicker or stronger current, than that blood which passed to,
and was returned from, the more remote parts. of the body;
as, in this child, the pulmonary artery and aorta were filled by
the contraction of the same ventricle. In the hearts of other
children, some time after birth, the muscular fibres of the right
side are much fewer ih number than in the left. If these circumstances are admitted as fact, viz. that the
blood circulating through the lungs of this child was combined
with a larger proportion of oxygen gas, and was returned in
a quicker and stronger current into the auricle than that re-
turned by the vent cave, it seems reasonable to infer, that this

blood, mixing and blending- with the dark | or unoxygenated
blood, would render the whole nearly as much oxygenated as
it usually'is found in the left side of the heart, and in the aorta;
therefore, that the blood circulating in the arteries of this child
would be fully equal to the support of life. Previous to birth,
this peculiarity of structure could not affect its health or growth,
as'the- placenta then answers the purpose which the lungs do
afterwards ; and the single ventricle seemed as equal, from its
Size, to propel the/blood on to the placenta, as both ventricles
in the natural state are, by means of their communication
through the ductus arteriosus *

The inference which has 'been drawn seems further con-
firmed, from the colour and heat of this child, during life, being
not perceptibly different from those- of other children. In all
those cases of malformation of the heart where the foramen
ovale, or the ductus arteriosus, has continued open ;' or where
the septum of the ventricles has been perforated, and the pul-
monary artery small, (and at the same time two ventricles,) it
has been observed, that the body had a livid colour, and, in ge-
neral, that there was a deficiency of heat.
