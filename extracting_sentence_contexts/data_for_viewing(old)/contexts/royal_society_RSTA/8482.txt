marked a feature of all the calculations based on the new and accurate wave-lengths
for the principal iron lines.

In the earlier experiments the are was burnt between common iron bolts (} inch in
diameter and 3 inches long), with the heads sawed off. These were screwed into copper
cylinders and mounted in an apparatus (see fig. 1, Part I, p. 268), whereby the two elec-
trodes were made to rotate on their axes in opposite directions in order to keep the
position of the are steady. Dr. J.O. Currr has, however, since found that equally good
results can be obtained by allowing the arc to burn between a small vertical electrode,
forming the positive pole, and a large horizontal negative electrode placed above it in
such a position that the tip of the small electrode nearly touches the side of the large
electrode. The current used is about 3 amperes. This device greatly simplifies the
taking of photographic readings, and its efficiency is proved by the fact that whereas
exposures of 30 minutes were generally given in the earlier experiments, the later plates
were taken with an exposure of only 5 minutes for a half-shadow angle of 10°.

(e) Secondary and Tertiary Standards of Wave-Length.—The value of the iron are varies
very greatly in different parts of the spectrum, according to the accuracy with which
the wave-lengths of the lines have been determined. The principal series of data are
as follows :—(i) Fasry and Buisson in 1907* published a series of 106 wave-lengths
from 2373-737 to 6494-994 of lines in the iron-are spectrum deduced from the primary
cadmium standard by measurements with an interferometer. In 1910, EversHEeimt
confirmed a part of this series and extended it into the red region by giving a series of
58 wave-lengths from 4282-408 to 6945-223; and in 1911 he added a further series
of 26 wave-lengths from 3370-787 to 4282-409. This confirmation was followed by
