There was an increase in the water collection on the beetle-inspired
surface because the droplets sitting on superhydrophobic spots roll off to superhydrophilic spots. However, the superhydrophobic surface resulted in no water collection. This is because of the fact
that smaller particles nucleate smaller droplets, as shown in the optical images, which could lead
to losing droplets to the wind [9]. Gurera & Bhushan [9] also performed experiments on various surfaces at 0Â° inclination angle. The data are summarized at two inclination angles in table 4.
