relations in the neighbourhood of each other.

II. Hitherto we have advisedly employed the vague term “ groups” to designate
the patches which are differentiated on the etched section by variations of colour and
lustre.

This is because we are uncertain as to the true nature of these groups, and it
appeared useful to preserve a distinction which is ordinarily ignored between crystals
which are defined by natural characteristic inclinations, and the pseudo crystals
which have been arrested in a more or less haphazard way in consequence of the
independent growth of neighbouring groups.* The latter groups have already been
called “cells” or “grains,” but the word grains appears in this case to be more
suitable, in view of the fact that interposed foreign matter is usually absent.

Microscopical examination, with a moderate enlargement of 100 to 300 diameters,
enabled us to see the parts respectively played in our alloys by crystals and by grains.
Pure gold when alloyed with 0°2 per cent. of bismuth, zirconium, rhodium, zinc,
palladium or thallium, is entirely formed of grains. The gold alloyed with lithium or
selenium only contains grains in the prismatic envelope, while in the interior the
grains have a tendency to pass to crystallites, and the result is mixed jointing, with

* The substance of the mass may, however, be crystalline.
