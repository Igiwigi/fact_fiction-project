Bearing in mind that the spectrum formed with glass prisms is condensed at the red
end and expanded at the blue end, it would appear from an inspection of the curyes,
that, with a normal spectrum, such as a diffraction-grating would give, the maximum
of action should be at a little below A in the ultra-red, and that the curve should descend
equally on each side.

192. 'This appears to be the most appropriate place to discuss the question which,
from its being almost invariably asked the first, seems to be of the greatest interest
to most inquirers:—* Is the effect due to heat or to light ” ?

I cannot answer this question, The terms heat and light are not definite enough.
The physicist has no test for light independent of heat. Light and colour are physio-
logical accidents, due to the fact that a 8mall portion near the middle of the spectrum

happens to be capable of affecting the retina of the human eye. There is no real
distinction between heat and light; all we can take account of is difference of wave-
length ; and all we can see in the spectrum is one continuous series of vibrations, longer
at the red end than at the violet end, but extending in an unbroken series for an unknown
distance on each side. I s8ay unknown, for it is probable that the whole spectrum, as
we know it, is limited by the imperfect transparency of the atmosphere, or of the refracting
