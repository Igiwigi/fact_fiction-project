This holds due to the theorem by Stone and the von Neumann theorem already cited above,
because there is a bijection between (bounded) self-adjoint operators a and (norm-continuous)
one-parameter groups of unitaries t+ e!"", hence we can pass from the Lie algebra Mga to (one-
parameter subgroups of) the Lie group U/(M) uniquely. In future generalizations of our formalism
beyond the case of von Neumann algebras, where the Stone-von Neumann theorem may not
apply anymore, it will be interesting to distinguish two Lie algebras which have the same Lie

group.


For every t, the exponentiated map e!* is a linear map from Ma to itself. In fact, Alfsen and
Shultz showed that e'" : M3 > Msa is a one-parameter group of Jordan automorphisms, and—as
one might expect—it acts by unitaries: for all t € R,

By assumption, f : Msa > Nga is a normal Jordan homomorphism, so both f o fia: Mga > Noa
and elif) 6 f: Moa > Noa are one-parameter groups of normal Jordan homomorphisms. They can
be extended to one-parameter groups of Jordan *-homomorphisms from M to NV canonically. f is
a morphism of von Neumann algebras if and only if these two one-parameter groups are equal. :

As we discussed at the beginning of this subsection, there is a one-to-one correspondence :2
