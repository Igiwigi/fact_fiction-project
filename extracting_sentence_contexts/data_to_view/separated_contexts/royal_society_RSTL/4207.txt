At g, fig. 11, is represented,
under the same magnifying power with the foregoing, an object which I have detected
in one of my vertical 8ections of the shell, where it occupies one of the superficial
cells, the cover of which is deficient. Now it is quite possible that this cell may
have been accidentally abraded, and that the object in question may have found its
way into it ab externo; its position and aspect, however, seem to me much more
conformable to the idea, that it bas been developed in the disk itself, and that it has
burst through the lid of the cell by its own enlargement, in preparation for its final
escape. And this view seems borne out by the fact, that I have frequently found a
few cells open on different parts of the surface of disks which did not appear to have
suffered any abrasion; as if the rupture of their lids had taken place as an ordinary

and in my belief generically identical with it, I shall have occasion to show, that there is not only no proof of
the existence of such a limitation to its growth, but that there is strong evidence to the contrary. GENUS ORBITOLITES :—REPRODUCTION ; VARIATIONS IN SIZE. 213

phenomenon of their development, instead of being the result of accident.—I do not
wish toattach any weight to the interpretations I have here offered ; bat I simply state
the facts, and the explanations of them which have snggested themselves to my own
mind; merely adding, what I hope to present in more detail at a future opportunity,
that bodies resembling the first or primordial cell, in which Foraminifera of all forms
originate, are not unfrequently met-with in the chambers of many other species.
