Scuusrer’s
cell, No. 97, had been taken to London a few days previously. A number of observations on the difference between the Cell No. 90 and the
standard were made during the absolute determination of the E.M.F. Several of
fiese confirm the fact that No. 90 gained its temperature equilibrium more slowly
‘ian No. 1. Thus, between the morning and evening of August 14, the tempera-

of the bath rose by 1°. The difference between No. 90 and No. 1 increased from
220 5 units.
