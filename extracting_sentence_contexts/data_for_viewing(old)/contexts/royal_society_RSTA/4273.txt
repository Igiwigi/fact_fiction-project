use of a single word, ‘continuity’, technically a single feature of the situation, ‘the continuity of
a reversible transformation between any two pure states’ ([52], p. 2; emphasis added). Hardy’s
continuity axiom is different from Chiribella, D’Ariano and Perinotti’s purification postulate.
The point is that in both cases one axiom is sufficient to differentiate classical from quantum :
systems. On the one hand, there may not be a single system of axioms or postulates from which :=
QFDT could be derived. On the other hand, certain characteristic traits, the characteristic traits,
beginning with the role of 1, may reflect something singular about quantum phenomena. This
is more immediately apparent in the case of Schrédinger’s ‘characteristic trait’ or (correlatively) nee)
Chiribella, D’Ariano and Perinotti’s postulate, which deal with entanglement. But it is equally
true in the case of Hardy’s continuity axiom. According to M. Dickson: a]

The quantum state is ‘continuous’ (in Hardy’s sense) because for any two pure states, [s
there is another pure state that is ‘between’ them, and in fact this ‘middle’ state is a 8
superposition of the two original states. In other words, continuity holds precisely because :
the superposition principle holds. Continuity fails in the classical theory because the
superposition principle fails there. From this point of view, it is less surprising—though
not necessarily less important—that continuity is what makes the difference, in Hardy’s
framework, between classical and quantum theory. ([60], p. 321; emphasis added)

The superposition principle, I might add, is connected to both complex numbers and non-
commutativity in the formalism, and, via Born’s or related rules, to the probabilistic or statistical
nature of the theory, in accordance with the QP/QS principle, embedded in both Chiribella,
D’Ariano and Perinotti’s and Hardy’s axioms.

There are instructive specific parallels between Chiribella, D’Ariano and Perinotti’s and
