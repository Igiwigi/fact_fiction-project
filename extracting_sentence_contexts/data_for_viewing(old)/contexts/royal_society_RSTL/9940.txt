of the oil 80 much richer in nitrogen, and in such condition that the increase may
be determined by the soda-lime method, and the growth of the sncceeding cereal is
considerably augmented. The question, therefore, suggested itself—how far the
increased growth of the grasses proper in the mixed herbage was due to an increased
accumulation of combined nitrogen available to them, in the upper layers of the oil,
the result of the increased growth of, and accumulation by, the Leguminose, induced
by the mineral manure? Whether, in fact, where the plants are thus growing in
association, there is a paralle] action to that which takes place when they are grown
in alternation ?

This explanation obviously itself left unsolved the question of the 8ource of the
nitrogen of the Leguminosw, besides involving other difficulties. Still, ib seemed to
accord with other known facts, and to be at any rate the best that could be offered
in defect of more satisfactory or countervailing evidence. However, as already
referred to, after the experiments had been continued for 20 years, samples of the
8oils and suþbsoils were taken, from each plot, at different depths, and determinations
of nitrogen have been made in them. The results show a considerably lower per-
centage in the first nine inches of depth of the mineral manured plob 7 than in that
of the unmanured plot 3; and 80 far as the calculation of such results into quantities
per acre can be relied upon, the difference is more than sufficient to account for the
increased yield of nitrogen over the 20 years in both the gramineous and the
