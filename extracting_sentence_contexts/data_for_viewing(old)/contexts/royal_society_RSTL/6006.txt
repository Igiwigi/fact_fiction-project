E Moreover, the quantity of carbonic acid evolved in different decades of degrees of
Emperature shows that the relation is an inverse one. Thus in the four decades from
to 80?, the quantities evolved by Mr. MouL were in the ascending order—7*-98 grs.,
£237 grs., 6-45 grs., and 6:37 grs.,—a series continually decreasing ; but the rule is not
D well exemplified in myself (for a reason to be presently explained), since the quan-
Aies were 8:44 grs., 8:527 grs., 7-841 grs., and 829 grs. in their order,
3 The weekly averages show that in myself the rule was maintained in fourteen of
Mrenty-four weeks, and in Mr. Mov in eight of eleyen weeks.
& Hence it must be admitted that there is an inverse relation between 8as0nal tem-
Ferature and the respiratory changes.
E'But it is evident—and it is a fact of great interest—that there is no uniform relation
tween the degrees of temperature and the carbonic acid, such as would be necessary
HS determine the degree of dependence of the one upon the other. This will be proved
S two ways: first, by showing the changes which occurred during the long period of
Yonths constituting each season ; and secondly, the sudden increase of temperature in
April.
= Mr. Mov1's returns are more uniform than mine, and yet in those the progressive
decrease of carbonic acid with increasing decades of temperature is 80 irregular, as
343 gr., -887 gr., and 08 gr. In mine there was an increas? in the s8econd and fourth
decades. It is also shown in the foregoing Table, that the lowest state of the respira-
tion did not occur with the highest temperature of the season, but after the lapse of
two or three months, and the loss of 5® or even 109, yet with the temperature always
exceeding 60%. Further, the following Table shows that the same temperature is
