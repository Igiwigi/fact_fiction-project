Something of this
differentiation of the wall of the diverticulum has been noted by Franz (1925),
according to whom the nuclei dorsally and ventrally, both here and in the mid-gut,
are short and arranged in one layer, while laterally they are longer and arranged in
several layers. He did not, however, notice the differentiation of the cells themselves,
nor does he seem to have appreciated the existence of two distinct types of nuclei. In fact, he interprets the differences in appearance as due to the occurrence of less
cell proliferation dorsally and ventrally than laterally, and regards this as a primitive
character of simple guts. LANGERHANS (1876) has referred to the existence in the
epithelium of the mid-gut and diverticulum of some cells filled with large granules,
the remaining cells possessing a finely granular zone between the nucleus and the free
border. He does not refer to the nuclei of these cells, but his figure shows that the
former type of cell has a larger nucleus and a more prominent nucleolus than the
latter type.
