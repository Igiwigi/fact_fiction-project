31. The system of onefold relations is a precise equivalent of the given #-fold relation.
Every set of values of the coordinates which satisfies the given &-fold relation satisfies
the system of onefold relations; and reciprocally every set of values which satisfies the
system of onefold relations satisfies the given #-fold relation. But if we omit any one or
more of the onefold relations, then the reduced system 80 obtained is not a precise equi-

valent of the given 4-fold relation; viz. there exist sets of values satisfying the reduced
system, but not satisfying the given /-fold relation.

32. In fact consider a /-fold relation the aggregate of less than all of the onefold rela-
tions of the asyzygetic system, and in connexion therewith an omitted onefold relation ;
this omitted relation is not implied in the aggregate, and it constitutes with the aggre-
gate not a (4&+1)fold, but only a fold relation. 'This happens as follows, viz. the
omitted relation is a factor of a composite onefold relation distributively implied in the
aggregate; hence the aggregate is compoxsite, and it implies distributively a composite
onefold relation composed of the omitted relation and of an associated onefold relation ;
that is, the aggregate will be satisfied by values which satisfy the omitted relation, and
also by values which (not satisfying the omitted relation) satisfy the associated relation
Jjust referred to.

33. Selecting at pleasure any & of the onefold relations of the asyzygetic system, being
such that the aggregate of the / relations is a k-fold relation, we have a composite
