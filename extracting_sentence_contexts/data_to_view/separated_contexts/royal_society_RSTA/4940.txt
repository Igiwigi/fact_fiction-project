These papers were
then carefully reviewed and subjected to the following considerations:

(i) the paper must have had a high scientific impact when published and remain influential

today;

(ii) the need to ensure a balanced representation of the disciplines that Philosophical
Transactions A currently covers;

(iii) the desirability of including contributions from all of the various time periods across the
journal’s 350 year history; and

(iv) due to the considerable competition and the limitations of space, no scientist could be
represented by more than one publication. The 16 landmark papers selected received the approval of the journal’s Editorial Board. The fact
that only two of these papers celebrate the achievements of female scientists is a sad reflection of
the historical under representation of women in the world of science. Each landmark paper is celebrated by a commentary that places the scientific advance in its
historical and scientific context and discusses how the new knowledge obtained has influenced
developments within its scientific field, together with considerations of the wider impact of the
discovery. I greatly enjoyed reading these accounts and I hope that that they will provide readers


of this theme issue of Philosophical Transactions A with an insight into the essence of each of the
major scientific developments, a perspective of their significance and an appreciation of some of
the pertinent human dimensions.
