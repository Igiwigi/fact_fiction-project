character, have from time to time been found in the sandstone near the spot.

This spine, if perfect, would be 15 inches in length; its base or proximal end is of
an elliptical form; with a longitudinal median depression, which is bordered by a
gentle rounded eminence; the articulating surface has the corrugated aspect that
characterizes the ossified dermal scutes of the Hylezosaurus; and a comparison of the
base of this spine with that of the unquestionable dermal bones, confirms the correct-
ness of my original interpretation of the nature of these remarkable processes.

In the accompanying drawings the characters of the original are sufficiently de-
fined, to render further description unnecessary.

This fact is of considerable interest, since it demonstrates in the dermal system of
the extinct, colossal Saurians of the secondary geological eras, a similar exaggerated
development to that which prevails in the living diminutive representatives ; but while
in the existing Lizards the dermal appendages are flexible and cartilaginous, in the
foxsil reptiles they are rigid osseous spines; the difference arising from the ossifica-
tion of the ligamentous fibres of the corium in the dermal bones and spines of the

Hylezosaurus.
