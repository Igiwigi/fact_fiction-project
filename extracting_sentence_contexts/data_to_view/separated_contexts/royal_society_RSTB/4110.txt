Growth goes on rapidly during the two
or three days after these forms appear, no division taking place at this time. Different stages in growth are seen in figs. 22-25. As the body elongates it
gradually becomes spirally twisted, these individuals at last markedly resembling a
very large spirillum, excepting for the fact that with good illumination the flagella
can be seen. In this phase the creature is obviously the Spivomonas of the older
writers. In this form the body averages about 12-13 » in length by 13-2» in width.
