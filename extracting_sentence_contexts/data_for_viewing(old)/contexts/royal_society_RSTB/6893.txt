scopic structure of the chromosome and the molecular structure of other organic fibres of
which keratin is the best known, it is possible to provide a reasoned seriation of three
otherwise disconnected cytological facts, namely, (1) that the chromosome in the
prophase of meiosis differs from that at mitosis by its length, (2) that extreme elonga-
tion is associated with chromosome pairing wherever it occurs, i.e. in cells as different
as the spore mother cells of a fern and the salivary gland cells of a fly, and (3) that
extreme elongation is followed by supercontraction, in a definite sequence of cause
and effect.

This by no means exhausts either the information which could be extracted or the
range of problems which might be discussed on the basis of the photographs presented.
It seems, however, suitable to close the argument at this point in order to examine
as critically as possible the validity of the facts which have been used. This is par-
ticularly necessary in that some rather fundamental issues have been raised.

The conclusions rest primarily on the dovetailing together of three main topics,
(1) determination of the numerical relations of the coils visible in chromosomes at
different divisions, (2) observations on long-range elasticity, (3) determination of the
actual lengths of the chromosome thread, whether spiral or otherwise, at a number

* The contraction of chromosomes after pachytene has been more effectively studied than has the
extension before pachytene and these results agree in the main with the conclusions of Belling (1928)
in Lilium, etc., and of Sax and Sax (1935) in Tradescantia, etc., to name only two papers dealing with
this subject.
