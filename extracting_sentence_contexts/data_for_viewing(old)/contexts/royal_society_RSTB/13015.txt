cumulative effect of total reproductive isolation was 90.5%. P. pungitius were highly differentiated in their genome (figure 3

and table 1; electronic supplementary material, figure S3).
However, genome-wide Fsy was significantly lower in the sym-

In our whole-genome assembly of P. sinensis, 62 scaffolds sympatry (table 1; permutation test for comparing between
covering 461 Mb could be anchored to 21 stickleback chromo- allopatric and sympatric pairs, p < 2.2 x 107° for both compari-
somes, although the contigs belonging to chromosome 4 were sons). Interestingly, the density distribution of Fsy showed
split into two. The genome size of a closely related species, that both the sympatric and allopatric pairs had two peaks;
the three-spined stickleback, is approximately 463 Mb [84], however, these two peaks were clearer in the sympatric pairs
indicating that this assembly is likely to cover the majority (figure 3). This is due to the fact that the lower peak is shifted

of the genome. Obtained BUSCO scores were as follows: downward in the sympatric pair: the position of the higher
