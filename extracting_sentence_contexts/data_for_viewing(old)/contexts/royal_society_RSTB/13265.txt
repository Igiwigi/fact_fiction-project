produce one-head worms, two-head worms that always pro-
duce two-head worms and ‘Cryptic’ one-head worms that
have a destabilized target morphology. These Cryptic worms
have a bioelectric circuit that has been permanently shifted
into a state in which it spontaneously settles into a two-
headed or a Cryptic state upon each cut (and this change
did not require genomic manipulation). The state diagram
summarizing these results is shown in figure 1c. Similar
phenomena have been seen in bacterial ‘persisters’ [83,84],
but to our knowledge, this is the first example of a discrete,
permanently destabilized target morphology in metazoa.

Two interesting facts should be noted. First, the decision
whether to make one head or two is made by each fragment
independently: two pieces cut from the same worm do not
always make the same choice—each piece undertakes its own
‘coin flip’ between those outcomes (it is not set by the parent
worm). Second, this decision is stochastic at the level of the
fragment, not the individual cells. Thus, what we do not observe
are mosaic, speckled worms in which 70% of the cells want to
make one head and 30% want to make two. Rather, each cell in
the fragment agrees with the group decision to make one head
or two (at a 70-30 frequency at the population level). The bi-
stability here is at the level of the cellular collective. Indeed,
the basic phenomenon of head/tail regeneration reveals that
