Now Tarr* has shown that , of all atoms moving with velocity v, a fraction e~*
penetrates unchecked to distance p, where

= 2 (1 ie eet [ iv’ )
f=4ane . fact + ae T on he id

ow 2,

We may write this function of v as follows :—

Pp
»—F2 / 1
= mins [< + | pa 2) a rp
- 7 | P _ \ pa 4+ Ir ¢

where P = vii,

ec = wns’,
n = number of atoms in unit volume,

s = diameter of atom.
