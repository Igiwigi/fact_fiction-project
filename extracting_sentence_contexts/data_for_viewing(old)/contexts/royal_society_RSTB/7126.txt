* The junction between these two nerves is shown by Batham in her lateral reconstruction of Pollicipes
(1945, plate 51, figure 10). She, however, does not figure any nerves spreading round the capitulum and also
like other authors she figures what I have called the corono-lateral nerve as entering the adductor muscle.

At the same time, however, as the peduncular muscles contract, I have maintained that
Darwin’s muscle also contracts (see p. 123), and actively pulls apart the terga. In agree-
ment with this view is the fact that the coronal nerve can be traced with complete certainty
to terminate on Darwin’s muscle.
