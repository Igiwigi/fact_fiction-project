6 the case, then the filling of the experimental tube itself with dry air would produce no

E ments revealed might be accounted for, and the difference between myself and Pro-

I think the hypothesis is disposed of by the foregoing experiments; for here the

* The present Number of the *Monatsbericht‚Äù of the Academy of Berlin contains an account of 80me experi-
ments executed with plates of rock-8alt by Professor Macxus. The plates which stopped the ends of a tube
were 80 far wetted by humid air that the moisture trickled from them in drops. As might be expected, the
plates thus wetted cut off a large amount of heat. The experiments are quite correct, but they have no bear-
ing on my results. In the earlier portions of my journal many similar cases are described, In fact, it is by
making myself, in the first place, acquainted with the anomalies adduced by Professor Macxvs, that I have
been able to render my results secure. I may add that the communication aboye referred to was made to the
Academy of Berlin before my friend had an opportunity of examining my rock-salt plates. I do not think he
