Cliffâ€™s 5 estimates the probability that a randomly
selected value in one sample is higher than a randomly selected
value in the second sample minus the reverse probability. Invert-
ing the two samples changes the sign of the statistic. As in a f-
test, the null hypothesis is an absence of difference of the studied
variable between the two time steps and the alternative hypoth-
esis the fact that the difference is significant. This test is not
associated with a probability of rejection of the null hypothesis,
but it uses threshold values for 161 to indicate the magnitude
of difference [35]: negligible for less than 0.147, small for less
than 0.33, medium for less than 0.474 and otherwise large. We
calculated Cliffs 5 using the effsize library in R.
