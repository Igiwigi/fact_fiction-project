= Preliminary. E Tar experimental determination of the relation between magnetisation and magnetising
Sforce, would be a simple matter if the expression of 8uch relation were not complicated
&by the fact that the magnetisation depends not alone on the magnetising force at the
b= instant, but also upon previous magnetising forces ; in fact, if it were not complicated
S = by the phenomena of residua] magnetism. In the absence of any satisfactory theory,
we can only experimentally attack particular cases, and the results obtained have
-2 only a limited application ; for example, we may secure that the sample examined has
Z never been submitted to greater magnetising force than that then operating, and we
Smay determine a curve showing the relation of magnetisation to magnetising force
EZ when the latter is always increasing ; we may also determine the residual magnetism
Ewhen after each experiment the magnetising force has been removed. Such curves
= have been determined by RowLaxp (Phil.
