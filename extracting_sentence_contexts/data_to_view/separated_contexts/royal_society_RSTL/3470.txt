One portion of the solution thus saturated with iodine was allowed to evaporate
spontaneously over suIlphuric acid im vacuo. A white crystalline residne remained,
and the suIphuric acid became filled with minute crystals of iodine, whilst on opening
the receiver it evidently contained the vapour of iodide of ethyl. After exposing the
white crystalline residue to a slow current of dry air for some hours, to remove the
remaining traces of iodide of ethyl, it was ignited with oxide of copper, when it yielded
traces only of carbonic acid and water; it was in fact pure iodide of zine. The second
portion of the solntion was distilled from a water-bath ; the distillate consisted of
ether and iodide of ethyl; on being frequently washed with water, dried over chloride
of calcium and redistilled, it yielded a large quantity of pure iodide of ethyl, which
boiled at 72* C., and gave the following analytical results :—

*7253 grm., burnt with oxide of copper, gave *4155 grm. carbonic acid and '2093
grm.
