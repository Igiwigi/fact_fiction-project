When this has been thoroughly washed and suspended in Ringer's
solution it exhibits a definite sensitiveness of reaction to small doses even of fresh
guinea-pig serum. In testing the anaphylatoxin preparations, therefore, we kept in
every case a sample of the serum used in the preparation, and compared the action
of this on the plain muscle with that of the anaphylatoxin prepared from it. This
was additionally important, in view of the fact that different samples of plain muscle
exhibit a widely differing sensitiveness to the action of serum. Starch Anaphylatowin.â€”We made the experiment with several batches of this
preparation, and failed in every case to detect any difference between its action on the
isolated plain muscle and that of the normal serum from which it was prepared. One
experiment may be quoted in detail.
