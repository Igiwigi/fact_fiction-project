chamber, among the coarse and characteristic
perforations, a feature which entirely escaped the attention of p'Orgieny, though
he particularly sought for a definite aperture.’ In many of our Kerimba Archi-
pelago specimens the entosolenian tube terminating inside the float chamber is
crowned with a kind of “ crown” of more or less highly developed spines (fig. 40). It was Eartanp, in the year 1902, who called attention to the fact that this
umbilical entosolenian tube was not an opening of communication between the
protoplasmic body of the organism and the surrounding medium, but communicated
directly with the corresponding umbilical tube of a lobulated inner chamber which
he described as a “ float-chamber” which, in the vast majority of specimens observed,
is absolutely empty. * A careful examination of a very large number of specimens,
made by the delicate operation of dissecting off, first the outer balloon-chamber
(fig. 41), and then the inner float-chamber (fig. 42), and also by sections of the
whole shell down the median plane (fig. 43), shows that the latter has no perforations
connecting it with the rotaline aboral portion of the shell, and it becomes an
extremely interesting problem whether or not this float-chamber can be filled at will

by the organism with air (or gas) for the purpose of raising it to the surface water
of the ocean, or in turn with water for the purpose of sinking it to the bottom.
