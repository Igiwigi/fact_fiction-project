of its neighbours [35]. This approach was left aside for circumstantial reasons until 1958 when : =
Ericksen & Truesdell [36] raised attention over it as a fruitful view for building up direct models :3
for shells, rods, and their like [37-41] (see also related works [42,43]. Starting from 1960, Ericksen : =
himself adopted that ‘philosophy’ of considering every material element as a system rather ZR
than a point to represent the dynamics of liquid crystals, above all those showing nematic [3
order [4447]. Essentially, the idea was to couple strain with phase-fields adopted in condensed :3
matter physics (see the extended critical review [48]) to describe microstructures. The approach : S
generated a rich crop of proposals for the description of various physical circumstances in which :&
microstructural events have gross-scale effects (porous bodies, liquids with bubbles, ferroelectrics, ma

magnetostrictive materials, etc.). It was thus evident that a view considering the construction
of a mechanical model to be reduced only to a selection of special constitutive relations is at
least restrictive. The construction of a mechanical model starts, in fact, from the way we decide
to describe the morphology of a body and its changes, which influences the representation of
actions, and thus affects the choice of constitutive structures. A foundational problem concerning
the wide taxonomy of specific models was thus to find whether they could be considered as
offspring of a common ground. A proposal in this sense by Germain dates back to 1973 [49]: he
considered descriptors of the material morphology in a linear space and the principle of virtual
work as a guiding rule. In so doing, he assumed a priori the weak form of balance equations,
which presumes the representation of microstructural interactions; then, he did not use per se such
weak form (namely for determining existence of weak solutions to boundary value problems or to
develop pertinent numerical schemes), accepting the regularity implying local balance equations.

In a 1989 book [50], Capriz summarized and pushed forward aspects of his previous work
on this matter (e.g. [50-53]) and proposed a concrete unifying framework in which descriptors
