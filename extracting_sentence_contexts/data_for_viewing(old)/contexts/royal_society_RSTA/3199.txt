we showed numerically in §4 that the linear operator Cy has no eigenvalues in the half-plane
Red > 0 other than a simple eigenvalue zero. In this section, we consider a fast combustion wave
for which we assume that this is the case, i.e. a fast combustion wave that is spectrally stable in
the weighted space Xq.

Linearized stability of the travelling wave in %, does not follow from spectral stability using
standard results. Since the system (2.1)-(2.3) is partly parabolic, the linearized operator has
vertical lines in its spectrum, so it is not a sectorial operator. Therefore, the linearized system
generates a Co-semigroup, not an analytic semigroup. This difficulty is typical for systems with
no diffusion in some equations.

However, linearized stability in % does follow from spectral stability by a recent result of
Yurov [10], for Xo equal to either L?(R,R3) or H'(R, R°). We postpone a discussion of this fact to
appendix A.

Unfortunately, nonlinear stability of the travelling wave to perturbations in %y does not follow
from linearized stability using standard results. The essential difficulty is that the weight function
Ya(&) decays exponentially at the left, so Yq includes functions that grow exponentially at the left.
The square of such a function grows twice as fast at the left, so it need not be in Xy. This makes it
difficult to study nonlinear problems in this space.

Our goal in the rest of this section is to use theorem 3.14 in [9] to obtain a type of nonlinear
stability for fast combustion waves that are spectrally stable in Xy. Theorem 3.14 in [9] as
stated does not apply to systems with transport terms (a0,@ in (2.1) and bd,Y in (2.3)), so a
generalization is needed. The necessary generalization again relies on Yurov’s theorem. We
