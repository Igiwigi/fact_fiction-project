from descriptions of the problem all the way to neural data
on the mechanisms involved in implementing the solutions.
However, to date, most neurophysiological studies of the
neural mechanisms of decisions use economic concepts, not
dynamical system concepts, to define the experimental para-
digm and interpret the data. Consequently, they do not even
address the kinds of embodied decisions that, we would
argue, defined the challenges faced by the vertebrate nervous
system at the time, many millions of years ago, when its basic
functional architecture was being established.

We have recently proposed that a great deal of neurophy-
siological data is in fact more naturally interpretable from an
ecological and embodied perspective than from traditional
cognitive perspectives [51,52]. In particular, the traditional dis-
tinctions between separate systems for perceiving the world,
storing and retrieving memories, thinking about an abstract
goal, and acting upon it do not find strong support in neuro-
physiological and neuroanatomical data [52-54]. Instead,
