The hotspot areal density
in the LMJ-scale simulation is notable, as 0.3 gcm~? is sufficient for ignition and matches the
target areal density for the NIC ignition design [24]. However, actually igniting such a capsule
requires higher temperatures; the analytic model discussed in §2 estimates that such an areal
density would require an ion temperature of around 5.5 keV to ignite, which is in agreement with
the temperatures targeted during the NIC from hydrodynamic assembly (it was expected that the
ultimate temperature for such a capsule would then reach 10-12 keV, since significant self-heating
would occur once ignition took place) [1]. These specific results themselves are not particularly impressive—it is the fact that such results
have been achieved in this new low-instability regime which is of note. Much higher gains than
those quoted here have been reported at lower energies in previous simulation work. The novel
aspect of this work is that such results have been achieved in this new regime, where instabilities
are expected to be minimized.
