The Baltic yariety is 8mall, and usually black ; but both in the recent and fossil
individuals it sometimes exhibits its usual yariety of colours. Some specimens also
of a land shell (Bulimus lubricus) occurred with the marine at Brinkyrka.

The height of these shells has been determined by Colonel Harusrrom to be seventy
Swedish feet above the Baltic ; s0 that they indicate a fall of the waters, or rather a
rise of the land, to that amount, since the neighbouring gulf was inhabited by this
assemblage of Testacea. But the most remarkable spot where these Baltic shells
occur in a fossl state is still further to the south, at S5dertehe (see the Map, Plate I.),
about sixteen miles south-west of Stockholm, where they are found eleyated more than
ninety feet above the sea. At Sidertelje a canal was cut in 1819 across a barrier
of sand, gravel, and clay, which separated Lake Maeler from a long narrow inlet or
frith of the Baltic. The canal is, in fact, carried through the bottom of one of those
valleys 80 common in this district, of which the zides consist of rocks of gneiss, and
the bottom of the same covered by more recent deposits. The accompanying trans-
verse section (fig. 3.) will explain this geological structure.

The boundary hills of bare rock rise to the height of two hundred feet, the newer for-
