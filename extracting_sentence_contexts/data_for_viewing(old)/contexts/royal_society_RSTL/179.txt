placed in absolute contact with them.- Hence iit- appears, [that
decomposition of water may take place by:common electricity,
as well as by the electric pile, although no discernible Sparks are
produced.

The appearance of two currents of air may also be innltgted;
by occasioning the electricity- to pass by fine: points of com-
munication on both sides of the water; but, in fact, the resem-
blance is not complete; for, in every way in which I have tried
it, I observed that each wire gave both oxygen and hydrogen
gas, instead of their being formed separately, as by the electric
pile.

I am inclined to attribute the difference in this respect, to the
greater intensity with which it is necessary to employ common
electricity ; for, that positive and negative electricity, so excited,
have each the same chemical power as they are observed to have
in the electric pile, may be ascertained by other means.
