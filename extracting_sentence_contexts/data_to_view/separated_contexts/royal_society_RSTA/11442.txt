The whole apparatus, including the bulb
containing palladium, was made of boro-silicate glass. In the preparation of the hydrogen, the gas passed through two U tubes containing
platinised pumice, kept at 400° C., instead of 220° C., to remove any oxygen diffusing
from the + electrode. The purity of the hydrogen is evidenced by the fact that the residual gases from
the combustion of all the hydrogen—about 154 grammes—burnt in my eight
experiments and of the corresponding weight of chlorine yielded less than half a cubic
centimetre of nitrogen. If it be assumed that all this nitrogen came from the
hydrogenised palladium bulb (which is not likely), the maximum weight of nitrogen
present in the hydrogen was 1 part in 25,000.

2. The Palladium Bulb.—The palladium bulb, of which a sketch is given in fig. 1,
differed little from that described in the former paper.
