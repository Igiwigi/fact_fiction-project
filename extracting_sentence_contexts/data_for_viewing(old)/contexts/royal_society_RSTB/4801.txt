Tmesipteris tannensis, BERNHARDI.

With the exception of 7’m. Vieillardi, all the “* forms ” of T’mesipleris may provisionally
be placed in BeRNHARDI’S species 7'm. tannensis.

So far as the histology of the stem is concerned the three forms tannensis, elongata
and lanceolata are essentially identical with each other, so that one description will
do for them all. The notable points of difference from 7'm. Vieillardi lie in the absence
of medullary xylem, the sclerenchymatous nature and pitting of the pith and, so far
as observed, in the fact that the sieve-plates are always uniseriate.

Concerning the distribution of the phloem, my conclusions with regard to this species
are the same as in the case of 7’m. Viedllardi. Fig. 25, Plate 6, from a median longitudinal
section through the leafy stem, shows clearly a sieve-tube (iph) abutting on the one
side wpon a xylem strand and on the other upon the pith (p). It is not possible to
assert definitely that the phloem on the inner face of each xylem strand forms a
complete and unbroken layer. In fact, sections have been met with in which pith-like
cells were seen directly in contact with the xylem ; but such cases are not common.

The number of stelar bundles is smaller than in 7'm. Vieillardi, a fact evidently related
to the less crowded leaves. The vascular supply to the leaves and fertile organs was
carefully studied in paraffin sections, and on the question of leaf-gaps the conclusions
