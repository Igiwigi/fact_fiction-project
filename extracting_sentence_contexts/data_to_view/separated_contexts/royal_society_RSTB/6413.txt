This was repeated five or six times until the nymph hatched out. KinKer
D’Hercurais (1893-1905) claimed that light was necessary for the hatching of the
Moroccan Locust, and La Baume (1918) maintained that the intermediate moult
does not occur in darkness. The fact that in Locusta and in Schistocerca gregaria I have
observed both these processes to occur in complete darkness (in an incubator which
had not been opened several hours before and after the occurrence of these processes)
would appear to discount the observations of the above-mentioned authors. It
seems certain that light is not one of the stimuli which initiate the process of hatching
and intermediate moulting. III—Summary

The development of the coelomic cavities is described in detail.
