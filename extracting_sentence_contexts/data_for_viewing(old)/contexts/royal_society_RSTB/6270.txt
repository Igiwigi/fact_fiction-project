hatched areas indicate the occurrence of numerous examples throughout the period indicated.
The area outlined by the dotted line indicates the occurrence of a single parous pregnant animal
on May 18, no others being obtained until May 29

pregnant animals were known to be non-parous and were obtained between May 9
and June 3 inclusive with a single exception, S. 1143 (see p. 45). The 54 animals
which were known to be parous and pregnant were obtained on or after May 29,
with one exception obtained on 18th. It can be seen that there is a period of 15 days
between the last occurrence of non-pregnant animals and the last occurrence of
animals gestating their first litters. There is a comparable period of 20 days between
the first non-parous pregnant and the first parous pregnant animals excepting that
obtained on May 18. There is no doubt that the period of lactation must coincide
closely with that of gestation. This is shown by the fact that the active mammary
glands in lactating pregnant animals reach a maximum development during the
latter part of pregnancy and begin to retrogress before parturition. This is supported

by the consideration that suckling of the previous litter would have to be completed
before the next litter started to suckle unless the latter were sacrificed. If it is
assumed that the young appear in the traps soon after weaning begins then
