that this manuscript was never published is an indication of the author’s dissatisfaction with
its conclusion (which amounts to an algebraic version of the usual Bayes formula: today we
know that this is not the correct answer). This manuscript was later published under the editorial
supervision of Halperin [12]. The attempts to introduce a notion of quantum conditioning in
the context of C* and von Neumann algebras have a long history, which eventually led to the
conclusion that, in von Neumann algebras, there is an analogue of the conditional expectation,
but contrarily to the classical case, in general it is not a projection [13]. This problem will not
be discussed here. For more information on von Neumann’s role in the origins of quantum
probability, see [14].

Mackey’s monograph [15] was the starting point of an impetuous development of the studies
on the mathematical foundations of quantum theory. Very good expositions of the lattice-
theoretical approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics are available [16,17]. The fact that
no scientific discipline generated an amount of literature on its foundations comparable in volume
to that devoted to quantum theory is a clear sign of dissatisfaction not with the theory itself,
whose successes are undisputed, but on the distance between physical intuition and mathematical
formalism. The enormous success of the Feynman integral approach is most probably due to the
fact that it allows the well-established intuition on classical Lagrangian systems to be transferred
to the quantum domain.


Although not comparable with that on quantum theory, there is also a consistent literature 4 |
on the foundations of classical probability. Starting from previous ideas of Ramsay, De

Finetti succeeded in deducing the basic elementary laws of probability (including conditional “3
