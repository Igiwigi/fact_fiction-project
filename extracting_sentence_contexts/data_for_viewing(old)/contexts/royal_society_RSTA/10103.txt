J. Influence of Nitrite and Hyponitrite.

The abnormally high deposits obtained with the silver voltameter have usually
been attributed to anodic impurities. Such impurities would normally be oxidised
substances comparable with the persulphuric acids, with lead peroxide, or with silver
peroxynitrate. RicHarps has, however, made the suggestion that reduction may

* The fact that this figure is somewhat lower than the normal may be due to the trace of acid which
is liberated by the sulphide 2AgNO,+SH». = AgS+2HNO;. The solution did not, however, appear acid

take place at the anode with formation of silver nitrite. It was therefore of interest
to determine the effect of this substance on the electrochemical equivalent.

Ricwarps* prepared silver nitrite by boiling silver nitrate solution with finely
