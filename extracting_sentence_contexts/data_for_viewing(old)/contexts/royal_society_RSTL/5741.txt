Fany other direction than either A or A'/, and in this locality the deviation from the u≈øual
Z = direction of cleavage constitutes a powerful argument in fayour of the assertion, that the
& Cleavage structure is perpendicular, or nearly s0, to the line of maximum pressure.
65) A little north of Brownstown Head, on the side of Tramore Bay, near a place called
s Portoonaka Beg, and close to the Ordnance Levelling Mark No. 1, 1841, the rocks are
E beautifully cleaved with the peculiar flaggy or platy structure already 80 often described.
= "The cleavage planes have a bearing of N. 12% W., and a dip 779? E. This plane corre-
bonds with the system C, which ought to be a joint and not a cleavage plane; but it
80 happens, that in this locality there is considerable local contortion in the bedding of
the conglomerate and thin shales; and throughout the entire area, in which the flaggy
cleavage had this abnormal direction, I found the strike of the beds to have an azimuth
or bearing within a few degrees of that of the cleavage. The bearing of the beds, in
fact, ranges from N. 5% W. to N. 33? W., dip 109 N. Thus this apparent exception to
ihe first mechanical law of cleavage turns out, on examination, to be a remarkable con-
firmation of it. I should add, that the flaggy structure at Portoonaka Beg divided the
rock with great regularity into plates of 4 or 5 inches in thickness*.
* My attention was directed to this exception to the general direction of the flaggy cleavage by the

In the following Tables I have given the bearing and dip of every plane obs
and arranged them according to their geometrical grouping, taking the bearing of
