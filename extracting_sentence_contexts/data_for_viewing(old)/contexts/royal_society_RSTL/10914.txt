42, Application of the Equations to Mr. Tower's Experiments with Brass No. 2 to
determine the Oil Pressure round the Journal.

The approximate equation (74) is available to determine the pressure at any part
of the journal, 1.e., for any value of 0 80 long as c is 8mall, but these approximations
fail for much smaller values of c than for others, for this reason, together with the fact
thab the only case in which the pressure has been measured c is large, the pressures
have only been calculated for e='5, in which the approximations have been carried to
the extreme extent.

These are obtained directly from equation (107), and the pressures divided by K;c
are given in Table II., Section VI.

The results of Mr. Towrr's experiments with brass No. 2 are given in Table XII.,
Art. 34.

Had the friction been recorded in the experiments in which Mr. Tower measured
the pressures with brass No. 2 as with brass No. 1, the values of c might have been
