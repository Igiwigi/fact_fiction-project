chain of protuberances called ganglions, from which nerves are sent to the parts in-

has not heen employed in a very strict sense; because, besides the ganglions just
mentioned, which receive nerves from different parts of the brain and spinal marrow,
there are other protuberances also termed ganglions, which are formed on particular
