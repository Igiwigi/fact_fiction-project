Each was calculated from the mean of a large number of observations (in most cases
more than 20) at the temperature given. It must be stated that the results have
been tabulated in descending order of temperature—not in the order in which they
were obtained. This accounts for the fact that in two or three cases results are given
at very nearly the same temperatures. These were taken at different times, weeks
apart, in order to see if the rigidity came back to its original value after the wire had
been heated to a higher temperature. F2
