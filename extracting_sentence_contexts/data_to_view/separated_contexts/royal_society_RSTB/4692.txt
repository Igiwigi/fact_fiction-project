The form whose prothallus was discovered by Hottoway was identified by this author as 7Z'm. lanceolata ;
but the sporophyte shown in his photograph (Plate I, facing p. 3) does not agree with Dancxarp’s original
description and figure of this form (Danerarp, 1890-91, p. 204, fig. 6, Plate XV). It appears to correspond
rather to the 7'm. elongata of Dancrarp (loc. cit., p. 186, fig. 5, Plate XII; compare Plate 5, figs. 5 and 10
in the present paper). The discrepancy arises from the fact that DaNGEARD’S paper was not accessible to
Ho.toway.
