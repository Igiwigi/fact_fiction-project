Experiments
were made by Froupg on the resistance of boards towed through water, but the greatest
dimension was in the direction of motion, whilst the dimension across the stream was
much smaller. In air ZauM made similar experiments, and Stanton has shown that
both sets are in general agreement. The resistance coefficient does in fact fall continu-
ously with increase in k. The values of & are much greater than the 10,000 used in
our present calculations. For the purposes of comparison, use will be made of a special experiment by StanTon.*
