Weak solutions (finite kinetic energy): existence for all t > 0

First, we give an indication of why we should expect the existence of weak solutions, which are
solutions with finite kinetic energy that satisfy the equations in an averaged sense.

(a) Evolution of the kinetic energy

Suppose that u is a smooth solution of the equations, posed on a bounded domain 2 with
Dirichlet boundary conditions u|jq = 0, that exists for all t > 0. If we want to follow the evolution
of the kinetic energy then we can dot the equations with u and integrate in space

where here we have integrated by parts in the linear term and by |Vu|* we mean La lojujl*. Integrating by parts the nonlinear and pressure terms vanish!

[te /V)ul-u= I. uj (juju; = — [,@apim? + ujuj(9juj) = — I. ujuj(djui)
(since u =0 on 02 and djuj = V -u=0) and
| u-Vp =| ujdjp = -| (djuj)p = -| (V-u)p=0 (4.1)

(again using the fact that u is divergence free and zero on the boundary).

1n these calculations, we use the Einstein summation convention and sum over repeated indices. Note that very similar
manipulations show that [ o[(w- V)u] -v =— J ol(u- Vv] - w whenever w is divergence free and u or v are zero on 32. Therefore
