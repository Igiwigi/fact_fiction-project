The best makers will not, I believe, guarantee to supply wniform platinum, in the physical sense of
the word uniform, knowing that it cannot be done, at present at all events. + The deflection is read off on a plane seale, and is corrected for the fact that the angle turned through
by the light ray is twice the angle of deflection of the magnet and mirror. In order to apply this
correction with facility, a table of numbers was constructed. The correction may now, however, be
easily applied by the use of the recently published “ Reductions-Tabellen zur Gauss-PoaGENDORFFSCHEN
