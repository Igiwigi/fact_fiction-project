We are now in a position to discuss further the points postponed in speaking of the
relative representation of respiration and phonation in the cortex.

Tt will be seen that in the capsule we have thus arranged antero-posteriorly the
fibres subserving portions of the cortex which are placed rather transversely to the
mesial plane than parallel to it, and that, as might be expected, the acceleration
which is the highest and most anterior is similarly most anteriorly placed in the
internal capsule. To return now to the polypnoea obtained by exciting these fibres in
the internal capsule, Orr describes how by using needle electrodes he was enabled in
the Rabbit and in the Cat to evoke exactly the same polypnoeic condition that we
produced in the above-mentioned circumstances. He was exciting the fibres,
according to our view, of the capsule leading from the cortex. The very important
results which he obtained, and the bearing which these facts have upon heat
regulation and the pathology of fever wil! be found in his communicatien.

The next point is of course the relation which the laryngeal movements thus
described bear to the other respiratory movements. Where we had to do simply
with the acceleration of the laryngeal movements, of course such acceleration was
exactly synchronous with acceleration of thoracic respiratory excursions.

But when the fibres posterior to this were excited, viz., those which produced persis-
tent abductory movements of the vocal cords, then it was noticed that while the larynx
remained wide open in persistent abduction as long as the excitation lasted, never-
theless the respiratory excursions of the thorax were greatly accelerated ; another
instance of the differentiation of representation which we have before described.
