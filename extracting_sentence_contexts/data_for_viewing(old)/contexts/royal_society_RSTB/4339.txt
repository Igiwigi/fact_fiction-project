PROCESS IN THE VERTEBRATE HEART. 261

leyogram is represented for some 0°0450 to 0°0500 sec. or less, the interval between
the beginnings of the curves and & being approximately 0°010 sec.

The values of these three charted curves are given in the accompanying Table at
each 0°0050 sec. ; the curves fit, that is to say the values in Leads J and J/I are
together equal to the values in Lead J/. he corresponding angles, calculated
trigonometrically, are recorded in the last column of the Table, and are drawn in the
diagram beneath the chart (fig. 4). We see that the electrical axis is at first
directed at an angle of 120° to the horizontal, and that it is rotated anticlockwise
through 169°. The movement has not a uniform rapidity, being faster as the
horizontal position is reached; but this is a minor detail—the chief’ fact is the
uninterrupted character of the rotation; throughout it is in the stated direction.
As in the case of the toad’s heart, I judge this change in the direction of the
electrical axis to express an alteration in the ayerage direction in which the excitation
wave moves. Interpreting the movement of the electrical axis in this wise, we may
regard the diagram of rotation as expressing the change in the average direction of
the excitation wave from instant to instant; and may read in the early directions
the passage of the excitation wave downward and to the right in the septum ;

9 later its passage downward, or downward and to the left, at the apex of the
ZB ventricle; later its passage to the left in the lateral wall; and lastly its passage
£ upwards and to the left in the lateral wall near the ventricular base.
