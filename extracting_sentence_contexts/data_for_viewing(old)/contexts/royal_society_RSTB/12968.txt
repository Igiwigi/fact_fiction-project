characterized most of human experience—experience begin-
ning long before the emergence of modern humans. In
ancestral socioecologies, likely similar to those of hunter-
gatherers today, the attention of others is a dominant feature
of everyone’s cognitive ecology. Ancestral social sensitivities
that would have emerged when priority to engaging attention
and aligning interests was a survival strategy for infants
resulted in ‘learning without teaching’ [122,123], ‘learning
from no one’ [113] and ‘learning by pitching in’ [114]. Attending
to the intentions of others and responding to influence them is
not just the Bayesian problem-solving process that wires imma-
ture baby and toddler brains [124]. Strategies to attract, engage
and persuade persist through the counter-factual play of infants
[98,98], the pretend play of children [100,101] and the continued
alliance building and reputation sensitivity of adults.

Distinctive features of human communication that serve our
shared intentionality were explored by Tomasello (e.g. [125])
using philosopher of language Paul Grice’s [126] theory of
meaning. Cultural anthropologist Dan Sperber and colleagues
(e.g. [127,128]) also rely on Grice and identify persuasion as
the salient aim of human communication; In their account we
use reason, not because logic gets at truth, but to improve the
