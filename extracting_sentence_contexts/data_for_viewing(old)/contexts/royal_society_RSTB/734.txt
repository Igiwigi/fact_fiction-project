a rise of the mercury in the proximal leg of the U-tube, obviously due to the vigorous
absorption of the oxygen of the air by the yeasts, because, in the first place, it only
oceurred when the culture was made in air, and, in the second place the diminution
of voiume—z.e., the volume of gas absorbed—was in agreement with our knowledge
that nearly one-fifth of the air, by volume, consists of oxygen.

I had meanwhile attempted over and over again to isolate the Schizomycete, and
examine its properties in pure cultures, and at last succeeded in doing this.

It seems now almost ridiculous that I should have failed so long in obtaining
satisfactory pure cultures; but, although it is easy enough to separate the Schizo-
mycete now, when I know something of its vagaries, the difficulties were natural so
long as I looked only for the sheathed and gelatinous form. As a matter of fact, I
had isolated the organism long before this, but it was then regarded—at any rate
provisionally—as a separate species, to be worked out as time and opportunity
admitted.

Be this as it may, the first time I thoroughly satisfied myself that my tubes con-
tained the Schizomycete was on February 27, 1890, when I found that a culture in
Haypvcr’s solution presented the following appearances. The liquid in the upper
two-thirds of the tube was clear, but a sort of cushion of jelly-like substance had
formed at the bottom of the tube. This cushion proved to be composed of dense
coils and masses of the typical sheathed Schizomycete I was seeking for.

The history of this culture was as follows. On the 9th of the previous December,
