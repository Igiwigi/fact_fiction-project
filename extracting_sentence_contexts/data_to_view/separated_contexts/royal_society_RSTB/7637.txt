The CaCO, segregation must have been comparatively early-stage for, as
Richardson (1923) first pointed out, it precedes the compaction which crushed fossils in the
shales. The most important problem to be faced concerns the conditions under which uniform
bands of lime mud were subjected to diagenetic changes which resulted in the formation
of nodular limestones or bands of nodular concretions. The following facts must be
accounted for. Laminated limestones are always planar, and nodular structures are
confined to the normal type. Seams of laminated limestone as thin as 3 mm have been
observed (in H 1, Dorset), but normal limestones are never less than 3 cm, and thin
normal-type limestones in a thick shale sequence (e.g. laqueus sub-zone, Glamorgan) are
generally represented by strings of nodules.
