For the convenience of the reader, we include a harmonic is somewhat larger for human sperm (figure 4b-d). Although we cannot directly manipulate Co and C; in exper- d[Ca?*];/dt of the calcium concentration [51]. From the

these time-varying values of the rotational velocity correlate from marine invertebrates. This corollary, however, has not
