there is internal phloem as well as internal secondary wood. Dr. Scorr considers
these features to be mere anomalies, but in view of the condition found in the Osmun-
dace they are probably to be regarded somewhat more seriously. This probability
is strengthened by the fact that in another species, Lyginodendron robustum, described
by Mr. Sewarp (‘ Ann. Bot.,’ vol. 11, p. 65), the presence of internal secondary wood
is quite constant. Cycadoxylon fremyt, another species close to Lyginodendron, has
also internal secondary xylem and phloem. In both the last-mentioned examples the
primary centripetal wood is largely abortive. Of less interest in this connection is a
monostelic genus Heterangium, which has secondary wood but no pith,

One of the most important genera of the Cycadofilices is Medullosa. In this genus
the fibro-vascular system is polystelic, 7.¢., made up of a number of anastomosing
concentric strands. It differs strikingly from the ferns, however, in the fact that its
“‘steles” are surrounded with secondary wood, and the primary wood is often largely
abortive, being replaced by parenchyma and constituting the so-called partial piths.
The concentric strands have a varying configuration. The external ones which, on
the basis of the stelar development of the Ferns and polystelic Angiosperms we may
probably regard as primitive, often form continuous zones, while the medullary
bundles are star-shaped. The former are generally called “ plate-rings,” the latter
“‘star-rings.” An interesting feature of the same genus is the fact that the
internally formed secondary wood of the plate-rings is often a very thin layer as
compared with the outer zone. In a Medullosa with a single layer of plate-rings
only, this would lead to a condition closely resembling that described above in
Lyginodendron robustum, &e.
