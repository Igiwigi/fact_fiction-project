If now the value of y be computed on the same principles,
when z is put = 1000, it will turn out to be y = 1000'+*+
= 15,849; and this number expressed in atmospheres, by mul-
tiplying it by 2.4826, gives the value of y = 99,346 atmo-
spheres.

This however falls still far short of 54,752 atmospheres, the
force the powder was actually found to exert when the charge
filled the space in which it was confined. But in the 84th expe-
riment, when 18 grains of powder were used, as the weight
(80811bs. avoirdupois) was raised with a very loud report, it
is. more than probable that the force of the generated elastic
fluid was in fact considerably greater than that at which it
was estimated, namely, greater than the pressure of 10,977
atmospheres. c

But, without wasting time in fruitless endeavours to recon-
cile anomalous experiments, which, probably, never can be
made to agree, I shall hasten to give an account of another
