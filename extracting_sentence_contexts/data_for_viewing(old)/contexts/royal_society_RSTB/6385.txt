those forms in which the yolk is concentrated toward the vegetative pole of the egg
and gastrulation tends to become epibolic.

As a single family, the Didemnids are perhaps the most interesting, for, unlike
other families in which variations concern primarily differences in egg-volume alone,
in this there is considerable variation both with regard to egg-volume and concen-
tration and distribution of yolk within the egg.

Four genera were investigated, namely, Didemnum, Polysyncraton, Trididemnum, and
Diplosoma. In all the yolk is sufficiently concentrated to produce a very slow rate
of cleavage and an extremely epibolic type of gastrulation. Concerning the relative
amount of yolk, all that can be said with confidence is that it is greater in the egg of
Diplosoma than in the others. At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation
is less marked in Didemnum than in the rest suggests that the yolk is less concentrated
toward the vegetative pole. On this basis, namely, that there is proportionately
more yolk in the egg of Diplosoma and a somewhat even distribution of yolk in the
Didemnum egg, the differences in course of development may be explained. Trididem-
num and Polysyncraton eggs differ apparently merely in size. The eggs of Didemnum,
Polysyncraton, and Diplosoma have approximately the same volume.

Didemnum, in spite of its having the largest egg, develops to the tadpole stage in the
shortest time. The oozoid becomes, at 16Â° C, a functional miniature adult about a
week after liberation of the tadpole. At the tadpole stage, as there is also at the
same stage of Synoicids and Eudistoma, a mass of yolky cells are to be seen beneath
the branchial sac which are incorporated in the developing abdominal region before
