A fog appeared after an exposure of about one
Rinute.
& The presence of nitrogen thus appears to be unnecessary for the production of cloud
by the ultra-violet rays. There is no indication of any diminution in the density of
@he clouds or in the ease with which they are produced as the gas becomes purer. The quantity of matter in the clouds which develop under the action of ultra-violet
light is very small: as is seen from the fact that even isolated patches of the fog
remain suspended in the tube. Since the mass of each drop, even if its diameter be
as great as one mean wave-length of light, does not amount to 10-" gram, a very
large number of drops may be present although the total weight of the fog is very
small. The small quantity of matter in these clouds makes it very difficult to exclude the
possibility of their formation being due to the presence of traces of some vapour,
which might become oxidised under the influence of the ultra-violet rays.
