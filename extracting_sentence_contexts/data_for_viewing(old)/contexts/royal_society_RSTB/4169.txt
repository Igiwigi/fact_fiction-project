MEASUREMENT OF THE RATE OF HEAT-LOSS AT BODY TEMPERATURE, ETC. 185

estimating in this respect the difference between the atmospheric conditions to
which men are exposed, outdoors and indoors, in tropical, temperate and arctic
climates.

Searching the literature we have discovered that nearly a century ago a
Dr. Heserven(*), suggested the importance in estimating comfortable and healthy
conditions, of measuring the rate of cooling at body temperature by heating up a
thermometer and measuring the time it took to cool through a degree or two. His
valuable conception fell into oblivion. Rate of cooling has been studied by physicists,
but not by hygienists. Against Hrserpenâ€™s method was the fact that no two
thermometers are alike in their heat capacity as measured by their water equivalent.
When one of us (L. H.) independently conceived this method of enquiry and
introduced the kata-thermometer he thought that the same glass blower working to
scale might turn out bulbs sufficiently like to give the same readings. Experience of
the first batch of instruments confirmed this view, for the kata-thermometers cooled
under the same conditions in approximately the same time. Further investigation,
however, has shown that other batches of instruments, and even those of the same
batch, may vary, and that it is necessary to calibrate each instrument by determining
its water equivalent.

We have come across two other investigators who have made efforts to measure
rate of cooling from the hygienic point of view. Kuisskant("), in order to investigate
