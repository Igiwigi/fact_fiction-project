Using the value of u from equation (A 49), and identifying definite integrals equations (A 51)
and (A 50) in equation (A 48), we arrive at

Equation (A 53) is one of the central results of the present asymptotic expansion analysis, as it : S
gives the relation between the macroscopic undercooling (recall that up to the first order in ¢ : i
approximation, u*(0) = u* (0) + eu (0)) and the physical parameters of the model. This relation : &
is, however, different from the standard Gibbs-Thomson equation unless the second bracket on aaa
the right-hand side of equation (A 53) vanishes. Choosing w = HE + K/I), we ensure that Gibbs— : BS
Thomson condition also holds at ¢! order. DN

In terms of the phase-field parameters, the relation is [3
