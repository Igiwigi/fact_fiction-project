Figure 1. Grid cells exist in modules of discrete scale but similar orientation.
(a) A grid cell in mEC fires action potentials or ‘spikes’ at the vertices of a
triangular grid as the rat forages in a square arena (path shown in black,
spikes superimposed), adapted from [2]. (b) The grid scales (spacing between
neighbouring firing peaks) of the grid cells in each of five rats are clustered
around discrete values, adapted from [2]. (c) The orientations of the grid-like
firing patterns in each module were also significantly clustered, in all five rats. Grid orientations are shown for rat 217 for the small (black), medium (light
grey) and large (dark grey) grids, adapted from [2]. (d) Differences in the
orientations of grids are greater between modules than within modules,
but are still significantly clustered between modules (compared with the uni-
form distribution between 0° and 30° expected for independent modules),
