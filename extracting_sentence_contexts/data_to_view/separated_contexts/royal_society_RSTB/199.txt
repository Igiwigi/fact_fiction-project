are thrown out from the outer surface of the cortex, more especially around the base
of the stem. It is, however, conceivable that in some other species the outer, or
cortical, layer of the cups may develop long complex processes similar to those of Rt.
batis. The gelatinous layer, as already indicated, is comparatively unimportant; it
surrounds the cups (c.t., fig, 5), and fills up the spaces between the stems; it, in fact,
forms a matrix in which the cups are embedded, and in which the blood vessels freely
ramify. One of the capillaries is represented in fig. 5 (c.p.).
