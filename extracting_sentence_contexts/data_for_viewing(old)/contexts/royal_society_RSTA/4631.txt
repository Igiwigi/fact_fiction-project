After the Sumatra tsunami of 26 December 2004, Bernard et al. [1] emphasized that one of the
greatest contributions of science to society is to serve it purposefully, as when providing forecasts
to allow communities to respond before a disaster strikes.

In order to provide forecasts, a deep knowledge of tsunami run-up and inundation is required.
To acquire this knowledge, it is necessary to investigate the geological evidence and impacts of
past tsunamis, as well as generation sources. It is often difficult or even impossible to collect
data for a tsunami event owing to the fact that tsunamis are rare events. The small number of
available observations is the reason for the high uncertainty in the description of the source at the
generation phase, even after many years of scientific investigations in this area.

Therefore, computer models, also referred to as simulators, are used to study past and future :
events. Tsunami simulations can describe past events and model potential hazard scenarios [2]. =
The computer models can be run to generate evacuation maps that can help in mitigating the 3
hazard. To produce evacuation maps, the maximum possible coastal inundation for a specific {8
location must be computed. Additionally, the computer models can be invaluable to insurance :
and reinsurance companies. Da

Simulators are extensively used for analyses of complex physical phenomena, as they can tw
simulate real-world physical processes. Unfortunately, owing to the uncertainties about many :
