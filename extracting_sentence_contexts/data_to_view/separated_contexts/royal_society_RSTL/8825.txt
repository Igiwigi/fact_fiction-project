From a slightly different point of view, however, it may
be considered as an extension of two ideas, viz. first, that of the Jacobian surface, or
locus of the points whose polar planes with regard to four surfaces meet in a point;
and secondly, that of the Jacobian curve, or locus of points whose polar planes with
regard to three surfaces have a right line in common. More particularly, commencing
with the facts, first, that if a surface of the form ap +bÃ¾+cy touch a surface U, the
point, of contact is a point on the Jacobian, and secondly, that if a surface of the form
a@+by touch a surface U, the point of contact is a point on the Jacobian curve, I have
endeavoured to extend them to higher degrees of contact. Consider, then, a surface U=0 of the degree n, and other surfaces $6=0, 4=0, ..
all of the degree m, where m2 is in general different from n. Let the first differential
coefficients of U, 6, v, . . be thus expressed :
