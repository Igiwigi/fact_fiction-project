that ellipticity loss induces stress channelling, folding and faulting. In this article, the acoustic
tensor is derived, and wave propagation conditions are explored for anisotropic constrained
Cosserat solids, with full account of microinertia. For these materials, a new infinite-body, time-
harmonic Green’s function is obtained under antiplane deformation and used to explore the
dynamical behaviour of an extremely orthotropic material prone to folding. Results show that
folding localizes at the steadily pulsating force applied as a perturbation to a constrained Cosserat
material with extreme orthotropy and waves emanate from the source that degenerate into plane
disturbances parallel to the direction of ellipticity loss. Moreover, maps of displacements reveal
the emergence of complex patterns of deformation, typical of the material instability of a Cosserat
continuum. Special attention is devoted to the presence of rotational microinertia. This feature is
explored as connected to pattern formation. It is shown that its magnitude can change the sign
of the lower-order derivatives in the differential equations of motion, so that its effect on the
emergence of deformation patterns is very complex and sometimes counterintuitive. In fact, as
related to the presence of microinertia, the formation of a folding wave propagating along the
discontinuity lines is shown to become possible.

2. Dynamics of couple-stress elasticity

In this section, the basic elastodynamic equations are introduced for linear anisotropic couple-
stress solids. A detailed presentation of the couple-stress theory (called also ‘constrained Cosserat
theory’) can be found in [7] (see also [4,8]).

The kinetic nergy density, evaluated with respect to an inertial frame of reference, differs from
the classical form due to the presence of the microinertia of the continuum which measures,
through the symmetric structural tensor Opa the effect of the spin @p. It can be written as [9, p.
