It is interesting to observe that the thumb obeys the same
general rules respecting the relations of the movements of flexion and extension as do
the digits; thus extension precedes flexion in the ascending frontal and follows
flexion in the ascending parietal. ‘The movement of opposition, which is, of course,
the most highly differentiated one, was only obtained on stimulating the lowest part of
the thumb area, viz., the centres 7 and 5’ ; this is in perfect harmony with the general
plan of representation, as we have found it to exist in the outer convex surface of the
cortex, (See Axioms 1 and 2.) We may here refer to the fact that in 5’, in the ascending frontal gyrus, we obtained
in two cases abduction of the thumb, whereas adduction was present in two cases in
centre 7 in the ascending parietal; this is a further illustration of the fact that
extension is represented in the ascending frontal, and flexion in the ascending parietal
convolutions. Before leaving the consideration of the representation of the thumb, we would
briefly draw attention to the fact that the representation of the thumb extends lower
down anteriorly, z.e., just behind the pracentral sulcus, than that of any other part
of the upper limb, Thus it is represented at centre 5’, but not in centre 5, &e.
(See Table 3.) We employ throughout our paper this expression—Primary Movement—in a very
definite sense, namely, to express that movement which is represented above all
others at one particular spot in the cortex.
