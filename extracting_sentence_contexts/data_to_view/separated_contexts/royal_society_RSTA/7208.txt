From an inspection of (155) we can follow qualitatively what happens as the receiver
starts at the boundary and proceeds away from the transmitter and off to infinity over the
perfectly conducting sheet. When J (7 d) is sufficiently small, the first term, which represents
the field in the absence of the conducting sheet, predominates; in fact, (153) and (154) give
a smooth transition across 7 — 0, although the asymptotic approximations on which §7 is
based can only be expected to apply at distances of greater than half a wave-length, say,
from the boundary. But since the first term is itself small, the second term very soon takes
over, and consequently there is a rapid increase of field-strength with distance in the region

just beyond the boundary, a recovery effect. Finally, when \/(r/d) +1, (155) becomes

in this last case, therefore, the field is equivalent to that ofa transmitter in the presence ofan
infinite perfectly conducting sheet whose power and phase are modified in accordance with
(156); a result which confirms the obvious supposition (P.
