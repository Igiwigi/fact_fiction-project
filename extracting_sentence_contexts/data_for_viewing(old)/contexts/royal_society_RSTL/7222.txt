For the series contained in Table IX. common water was used. Water from the
laboratory tap was well boiled to precipitate the carbonates held in solution by the free
carbonic acid, filtered and mixed with 25 per cent. of distilled water, to prevent any
precipitation of salt on boiling to drive out the absorbed air; in fact these 25 per cent.
were added to replace the loss by evaporation. "The determinations with this water were

carried out in the usnal manner; the piece of glass employed was the same as that used
{or Series 3.
