Abundance of granules of colouring matter of most
minute size, and not more than one-third the diameter of the spermatozoa of the
Frog seen beside them, adhered to the surface of the envelopes, and it was to these
chiefly that the red colour of the whole was due. Every part of the envelope exhi-
bited the same uniform appearance, the granules being pretty equally distributed over
the surface, and the suffusion of colour was uniform in the interior. These facts ap-
peared to be conelusive with reference to the question of the presumed existence of a
fissure or perforation through the coverings of the egg of the Frog before, or at the
moment of fecundation, as is supposed to exist in the ovum of the Rabbit. I have
not been able to detect any appearance of orifice or fissure in the egg of the Frog-
envelopes, and the course of which, if such really exists, would no doubt be indicated
by some deposition of the colouring matter of the carmine, to a greater or less ex-
tent, in its tract. The result of these experiments was thus most unfavourable to the
belief that the spermatozoa penetrate bodily through the membranes of the oyum ;
and to that of the supposed existence of a special opening in these membranes for
their admission.
