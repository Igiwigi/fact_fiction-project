(b) Molecular dynamics simulations

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using the DL_-POLY program [44]. We
considered a microcanonical ensemble of particles (NVE), and simulations lasting 20ns were
carried out for Nat-(Bz), and Cs*-(Bz)4 at different values of temperature, T. Within the NVE
ensemble of particles, one can ensure the conservation of the total energy (kinetic+potential)
of the cluster system (Etot = Ekin + Ecfg). A time step of 0.001 ps, which is large enough to keep
the fluctuations of EyoÂ¢ (when no isomerization occurs) well below 10-5 kj mol7!, was used in
all the simulations, which were performed without imposing boundary conditions. The initial
configurations are those derived in our previous work [29]. As in this work we are concerned
with the study of both the isomerization processes and the tendency of the clusters to dissociate;
the equilibration stage usually considered in MD is absent from our simulations. In fact, we want
to investigate the differences in the dynamic behaviour of the most stable isomers of Nat-(Bz)4
and Cs*-(Bz)4 and, hence, we needed to avoid the inconvenient interconversion among such
isomer structures that may occur during the equilibration stage of the system. This means that in
our simulations, independently of the T considered, the initial configuration of the simulations is
that of the most stable isomer. The analysis of the differences between Na*-(Bz)4 and Cst-(Bz)4
was based on the mean values of both the potential energy (configuration energy, Erg) and T.
Moreover, in order to distinguish between the isomerization and dissociation processes, the time
evolution of some relevant distances was also analysed.
