It is easy to
conceive that some substances, permeable to light, may be unfit
for the transmission of heat, in the same manner as particular
substances may transmit some kinds of light, while they are
opaque with respect to others. On the whole it appears, that the few optical phenomena
which admit of explanation by the corpuscular system, are
equally consistent with this theory ; that many others, which
have long been known, but never understood, become by these
means perfectly intelligible; and that several new facts are

found to be: thus only reducible to a perfect analogy with other
facts, and to the simple principles of the undulatory system. It is
presumed, that henceforth the second and third books of Ngw-
ToN's Optics will be considered as more fully understood than
the first has hitherto been; but, if it should appear to impartial
judges, that additional evidence is wanting for the establighment
of the theory, it will be easy to enter more minutely into the
details of various experiments, and to show the insuperable dif-
ficulties attending the NEwToNLAn doctrines, which, without
necessity, it would be tedious and invidious to enumerate. The
merits of their author in natural philosophy, are great beyond all
contest or comparison ; his optical discovery of the composition
of white light, would alone have immortalised his name; and the
very arguments which tend to overthrow his system, give the
strongest proofs of the admirable accuracy of his experiments.
