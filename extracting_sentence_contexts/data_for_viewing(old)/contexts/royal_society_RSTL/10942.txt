Only the lower half of the wall has thus broken outwards ; this © fault” forms the
alisphenoid (a.s.), whilst the orbitosphenoid (9.8.), the 80-called ©lesser wing,” is
many times its size, and is continuous, over the archway, with the cartilage that runs
on, backwards, into the snpracecipital Tegion (8.0.)

There is nothing similar to this in that Sauropsidan skull which comes nearest
to that of the Mammal ;—the skull of the Crocodile (s8ee Trans. Zool. Soe., vol. xi.,
plate 65), whilst in Birds the orbitosphenoids are very 8mall even when they are most
developed, as in Struthio (se Phil. Trans., 1866, Plate 7), and in that Class the
alisphenoids almost finish the cranial cavity, being turned inwards towards each other,
on each ide of the back part of the orbital septum.

I lay especial stress upon this rupture, outwards, of the alisphenoid, and of the fact
that the nasal roofs utilise the whole of the huge high-crested intertrabecula, because
these are the most distinctive marks of the Mammalian skull, and they arise out of
two things in which the Mammal shows its great superiority to even the highest

Sauropsida, namely, the huge volume of the cerebrum, and the tenfold complexity
of the nazal labyrinth.

A third clear diagnostic js 8een in thi
