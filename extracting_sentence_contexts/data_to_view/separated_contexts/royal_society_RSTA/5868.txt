The choice of such a state is clearly arbitrary. Therefore, rigid constraints are
preferred [50]. The present implementation of the quantum-classical methods in G-CTMQC [55] requires that
the contravariant metric tensor be diagonal and constant, so that the KEO and the volume element
are given by

Toop =— | +
. 2 IQBLA* AQTors 3QHOoP*

dt =dQpia - dQtors -dQuoop,

2 :
h (crm ” _ Glors,Tors a , GHOop,HOOP ? )
(3.1)

However, this constraint can be lifted for the exact quantum study, as, in fact, the metric tensor
is neither constant nor diagonal. The constrained metric tensor along the Tors coordinate (figure 7)
shows that, as a function of the Tors coordinate, the variation amplitude of each component is
relatively small. Furthermore, all components are symmetric with respect to the trans geometry
(Tors = 180°), except GBLATors and GBLAHOOP, which are antisymmetric (see the right panel of
figure 7).
