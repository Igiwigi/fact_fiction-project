Though conveniently considered together it does not follow that
the evidential weight to be attached to them is equal. Both are commonly regarded
as indicating that the distinction between the two generations is not a rigid one. Beyond this, which is indeed nothing more than a statement of the facts, widely
divergent opinions have been expressed. The explanation which may be given on
the theory of homologous alternation may be first considered, since the views held by
authors who have written from the standpoint of the antithetie theory are rather
critical than constructive. It is unnecessary to add anything further regarding the possible significance of
the facts of induced apogamy, with which instances of direct apogamy have been
connected by intermediate forms, on the theory of homologous alternation.
