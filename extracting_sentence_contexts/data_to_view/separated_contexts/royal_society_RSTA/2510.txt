In this case, we have
generated RUMs whose wave vectors lie along lines in reciprocal space, although the analysis
does not directly indicate which lines. In three dimensions, where we consider tetrahedra as the
analogues of triangles, this translates to special planes of wave vectors, but with different results
for both the highest-symmetry forms of cristobalite (cubic) [8,11,19] and tridymite (hexagonal)
[11,65-67].

Figure 6. Demonstration of the fact that a two-dimensional network of connected squares has exactly one RUM. We start with
the ring of four squares labelled 1. In two dimensions, each square has 3 d.f,, and there are two constraint equations per linkage.
