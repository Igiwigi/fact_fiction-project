DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANICS OF THE AVIAN STERNUM 443

After 1-2 hr. incubation the whole explant had greatly contracted. Contraction
then ceased and the tissue began to expand owing to the amoeboid migration of the
marginal cells.

Although the explant enlarged, the sternal plates did not move apart, but instead
began to approach one another as in normal development (fig. 27, Plate 38). That
this approximation of the plates was not due merely to expansion by growth was shown
by the fact that the distance between their outer (costal) margins diminished as well
as that between their inner (ventral) margins. The front-ends of the plates came in
contact first, after which the hind-ends continued to move inwards until the outer
edges of the plates, which originally sloped away from each other, became parallel or
might even converge posteriorly. After 48 hr. growth the plates were usually in contact
for about two-thirds of their length (fig. 27¢, Plate 38).

Correlated with the movement of the sternal plates was a great thickening of the
intervening tissue, which became heaped up into a broad, thick, median ridge con-
taining enormous numbers of opaque, degenerate cells. In cultures where the skin
had been almost or completely removed, these necrotic cells drifted offinto the medium
in a loose cloud, so that after 2 days’ cultivation the ridge had become much
smaller.
