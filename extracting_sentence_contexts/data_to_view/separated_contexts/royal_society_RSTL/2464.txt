Without, however, asserting (which might reasonably be
done) that every annulose animal which in its immature state is furnished with loco-
motive organs, is also furnished with instrumenta ecibaria, which latter legitimately
represent the instrumenta cibaria of the imago, whilst the former as truly represent
the true legs of the imago, we may assert, that where an immature annulose animal
is furnished with locomotive organs, these, or at least some of them, represent the
true thoracic legs of the imago, and are not, in such immature state, merely rudi-
mental trophi of the perfect animal. Now on applying this principle to the case in
question, we find the Zoe furnished both with trophi and natatory organs ; and if we
regard the trophi, although few in number, as representatives of the trophi, and the
two pairs of natatory organs as representatives of the locomotive organs of the fature
Crab, we can only regard the five pairs of disengaged limbs either as representing
the subabdominal appendages of the Crab, or as simple thoracic appendages (distinct
from legs), or as supplemental limbs. But each of these suppositions is s0 contrary
to nature with reference to the organization of Zoe or the Crab as distinct animals,
that in order to show their futility it will be sufficient to notice the determinate leg-
like form of these disengaged limbs, the first pair of which is cheliferous ; the fact
that the Zoea has distinct suhabdominal appendages ; that the Crustacea are not, like
the Myriapoda, furnished with auxiliary limbs ; and that true thoracic locomotive
organs (which in Zoe, according to the principles above stated, must still remain
undeyeloped,) are constantly developed at the same time as, or even before, supple-
mental ones. Thirdly, We may imagine the disengagement of these © future limbs” to take
place in a mixed manner, by considering that the two pairs of natatory limbs of the
Zoe produce the first, or chelate, and second pairs of legs, and that the three posterior
pairs are simply disengaged from beneath the clypeus. Against this idea many of
the preceding observations may be conjointly adduced ; to which it may be added,
that the similar size of these disengaged limbs is sufficient to prove that they must
have undergone an equal degree of deyelopment.
