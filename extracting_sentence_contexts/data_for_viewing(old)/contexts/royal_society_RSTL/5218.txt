value of a disturbed easterly observation is less than a westerly on the average of

discrepancies in the different months.

Next, distributing the disturbances into the several hours of their occurrence, the
following table is obtained. The facts, besides being very remarkable when viewed
alone, acquire 80 much additional interest when exhibited in contrast with the law
