VNS activates neuronal and astrocytes a7nAchR, and
inhibits the apoptosis and oxidant stress responses possibly associated with increased Akt
phosphorylation and miR210 expression [89]. VNS has also been linked to cardiac diseases [90-92]. These diseases, in fact, still have
a high mortality rate owing to neurohormonal activation and autonomic imbalance with
increase in sympathetic activity and withdrawal of vagal activity. VNS could be a viable
solution to counteract the sympathetic tone and enhance the vagal tone, with applications for
heart failure, atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease induced by increased sympathetic
nerve activity [90,91,93]. The improvement in heart failure and the anti-inflammatory and
vasodilatory properties of VNS provide additional antiarrhythmic benefit [94].
