investigations of equilibrium properties significantly more complicated (e.g. [76-78]).


stationary states constituting the thermodynamic branch.!” The system can only become unstable
if the environmental constraints drive it away from equilibrium, increase dissipation and make it
reach the finite threshold value beyond which only dissipative structures can appear.

Often this phenomenon is explained as resulting from the coupling between chemistry and
diffusion, sometimes even it is presented as a kind of diffusional instability. Obviously, by
definition and mathematically speaking, reaction—diffusion equations comprise chemical and
diffusion terms. But, physically speaking, concluding from this evidence that chemistry and
diffusion are coupled irreversible processes is sloppy language. It should best be avoided
because it nullifies the fact that the Curie theorem applies and affirms that such coupling is
physically impossible in the system considered. One has to remember that this theorem is a
most important piece of the puzzle assembled by Prigogine in his thesis. Postulating, as he did
at that time, that this theorem established in 1894 in connection with equilibrium phenomena
needs to be incorporated in the formulation of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a conceptual : =
breakthrough. It obliged awareness its much greater generality than the physical context for 38
which it was originally formulated. As a consequence, the Turing instability, on the contrary :

dampen because the thermodynamic forces of diffusion are independent from chemical affinities; DN
the increases of the latter have no influence on diffusion fluxes. 2S
