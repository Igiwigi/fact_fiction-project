Foils with Bi concentrations above maximum solubility exhibit similar microstructures as those
of the Sn-20 wt.% Bi alloy. Figure 9 shows microstructures of foils of Sn-30 wt.% Bi and Sn-43 wt.%
Bi. Again, two types of microstructures are observed: areas of A-type with regular lamellae of Bi
(formed during the first stage of decomposition) in Sn, and areas of B-type with coarse equiaxed
precipitates (formed during the second stage of decomposition).

An increase in Bi concentration in hypoeutectic Sn-Bi alloys increases the thickness of the
lamellae, decreases the lamellar spacing and increases the fraction of coarse equiaxed precipitates.
The similarity of these microstructures with those of Sn-20wt.% Bi allows us to conclude
that the solidification has also resulted in a supersaturated solid solution, followed by the
discontinuous precipitation in two stages at room temperature. This assumption is confirmed.
by the fact that the concentration in the microstructures of A- and B-types is equal to the
initial (nominal) concentration for all rapidly quenched alloys (cooling rate approx. 10°Ks~!).
Hypo- and hypereutectic alloys usually solidify by a dendritic primary phase and interdendritic
eutectic. The chemical composition of each structural constituent is, in the near-equilibrium case,
the concentration of the respective phase or phase mixture in the equilibrium phase diagram.
Thus, the composition of dendrites in hypoeutectic alloys differs distinctly from the nominal
concentration. In the present work, rapid quenching led to a uniform concentration distribution,
as measured by EDX in areas of 25 pm?.

This confirms

— complete solute trapping of Bi occurs in the Sn matrix during diffusionless primary
solidification, forming a supersaturated solution,
