Now consider the system ©’ of quadrics through c only. It is of freedom five ;
and any four quadrics of it clearly meet in two free points. Quadrics of ©’ can therefore
be represented on the prime sections* of a quadric Q in a [5]8,;; and there will be a
(1, 1) correspondence between the points of § and the points of 2. Since ®’-curves,
i.e., residual curves of intersection of triads of quadrics of ’, are quartic curves meeting
¢, in six points, it follows in the usual way that the locus of planes of Q, which correspond
to points of ¢,, is of order six V,. Now has two triply infinite systems of planes, say
a-planes and @-planes} ; and we take it that the planes of V,° are «-planes. To the
chords of ¢, there correspond as usual only points of 2 ; and these points form a surface
¢@ which is the double surface of V,°.

To trisecant planes of ¢, there correspond in fact the «»* 8-planes of Q ; and in particular,
to the trisecant plane joining the three points P, Q, R of c, there corresponds the unique
plane which meets the three planes of V,*, which correspond to P, Q, R, in lines.

To cubic ruled surfaces T which pass through cy there correspond then the «* «-planes
of 2.—For any such «-plane forms a [3]-section of Q with each of «* @-planes ; and to
any such [3]-section of Q there must correspond a ’-surface breaking up into a plane
and a cubic ruled surface I’.

* Analytically, we take coordinates of a [5] 8, to be proportional to six independent quadrics of ®’,
so that to any point of S corresponds a point of 8; which describes the quadric Q.
