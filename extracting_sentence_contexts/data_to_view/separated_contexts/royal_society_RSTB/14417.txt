Likewise, given an ingroup victim, taking together
with an ingroup co-decision-maker is weakly preferred over taking
together with an outgroup co-decision-maker. Notice that the
higher the concerns for ingroup members in the group, the lower
the expropriation rate of ingroup members. The fact that people
care more about their ingroup members’ welfare than their
outgroup members’ welfare then gives the following proposition. Prediction 2.1. Group constellations ordered according to
predicted expropriation rates are:

Out-In < In-In < min{Out-Out, In-Out}.
