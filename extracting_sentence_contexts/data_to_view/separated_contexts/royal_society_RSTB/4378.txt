W. H. Lana, F.R.S., for encouraging me to
attempt to relate the facts of the mechanical properties of wood to fundamental
botanical questions bearing on the structure of cell-walls in plants. The mechanical properties of a wood may depend on the microscopic or ultra-
microscopic structure of the substance of the walls of the cells comprising it, on the
form of these cellular elements, and also on their gross anatomical arrangement.

* Tt is recognised that a long thin column of wood may undergo mechanical failure by elastic
instability, but since the deformation in such cases occurs within the limits of elasticity and is not
permanent, the failure is accompanied by no permanent microscopical changes in the cell-walls of the
wood. In this paper it is the changes accompanying failure by permanent deformation which are being
considered,
