VE along nerve, like the sciatic nerve of a lamb. This nerve is electrolysed and divided into
E four equal parts, three of which are left disposed as they were during the passage of the
S current, and the remaining one is opposed to these three. This experiment was per-
formed by alternating the position of the pieces; a differential current of from 30* to 40 was
constantly obtained, owing to the longest piece. 'Fhe same effect is obtained from nerves
of frogs and fowls, whether the operation of cutting the nerve has been made after
being electrolysed or before. This result cannot be understood unless we admit that
the secondary electromotor power, which originally is greatest in contact with the
electrodes, extends successively to all the parts of a nerve traversed by the current.

T come now to the fact which I consider as most important in the application of
8econdary electromotor power to the explanation of certain electro-physiological pheno-
mena, 'This fact is resumed in the following proposition :â€”

The 8econdary electromotor power of @ nerve is not equal in all points of the nerve,

being much stronger in the portion of the nerve near the positive electrode, than in the
portion near the negative electrode : this difference is greater in a nerve traversed by the
current in the direction contrary to that of its ramification, than in a nerve traversed by
the current in the direction of its ramification.
