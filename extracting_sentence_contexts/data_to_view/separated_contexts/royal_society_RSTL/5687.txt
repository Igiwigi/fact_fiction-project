12. It is to be observed that in the general theorem the transformations or matrices
of substitution for the two sets of variables respectively are not identical, but it may be
required that this shall be 80. Consider first the case where the matrix Q is symmetrical,
the necessary condition is that the matrix Y shall be skew symmetrical ; in fact we have
then

tr. Q=Q, tr. Y=—Y,
and the transformations become
(z, y, 2)=(2"(2=Y(Q+Y)"'QXT, Yp 2),
(x, y. 1)=(2"(2—Y(Q2+Y)"'QFx,, I 4).
