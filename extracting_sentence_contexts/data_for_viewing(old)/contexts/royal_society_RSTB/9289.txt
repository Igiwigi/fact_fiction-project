melatonin-mediated immune enhancement, further studies
are required to identify whether this confers future fitness
benefits, particularly for natural populations. We discuss
our observations and highlight possible avenues for future
research with a focus on invertebrate species.

(a) Identifying underlying mechanisms and future
research areas

The link between circulating melatonin and immune function
is rarely highlighted in any species other than vertebrates,
and how melatonin modulates immune response remains a
subject of debate [72,73,90]. The fact that crickets maintained
on the Oygml! melatonin treatment had comparable
haemocyte concentrations and lysozyme-like activity across
the majority of their adult lifespan supports previous find-
ings that adult Teleogryllus commodus maintained under
intense constant illumination may have compromised immu-
nity and be less able to respond to immune challenges
(J Durrant, EB Michaelides, MP Green and TM Jones 2013,
unpublished data; see ยง1). This inability to respond to a chal-
lenge is likely a significant issue for nocturnal species such as
T. commodus that not only inhabit both rural and urban
environments but also have life history and mating strategies
evolved to be optimal during periods of darkness [91]. The
