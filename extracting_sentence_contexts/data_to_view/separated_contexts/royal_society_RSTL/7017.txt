The distance from the anterior edge of the presphenoid to
the level of the posterior margins of the occipital condyles is 4:5 inches. 'The cribriform
plate is rather shorter in proportion to the base of the skull in the Glyptodon than in
> the ordinary Armadillos, and its anterior part is situated far further back in relation to
the antorbital processes. The proper cranial cavity, or brain-case, is 8mall when compared with the whole size
of the 8kull, if the chambers.which lodge the olfactory bulbs are left out of considera-
tion. Tt is in fact only 45 inches long,.2'5 inches wide at widest, and about 1% inch
high at highest. Tts greatest width is situated beneath the occipital ridge, whence it
narrows towards. the olfactory outlet, which is about 1-25 inch wide. The immediate
side walls and roof of the fore part of the cranial cavity are formed by a very thin inner
: table of bone,.separated by a.wide air-chamber from the denser and stouter outer table.
