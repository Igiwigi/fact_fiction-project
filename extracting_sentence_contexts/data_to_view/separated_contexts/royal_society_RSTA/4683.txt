in the case of a full bottle to about 0Â°01 per cent. in the case
of a bottle which was nearly empty. Unfortunately I had used a large quantity of
the gas before I discovered this fact, but I was able, however, to calibrate the fine
tubes with pure CO, taken from bottles which were nearly empty, and in the later
calorimetric experiments I adopted the following device. Two bottles, A and B, were
arranged so as to be able to supply gas in parallel. The automatic pressure reducer
was fixed to the tube joining the bottles.
