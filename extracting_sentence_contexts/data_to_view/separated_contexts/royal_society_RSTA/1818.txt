2. Curves of the complete couple coefficient fy (v/a, 5) sin 6 against 6 for various values of v/a
(as shown against the curves). he curves stop at the greatest value of 6 for which observations are
available. The origins of all the curves except for type III. are displaced upwards and can be recovered from the
fact that all curves pass through their respective origins. The scale of 6 is in degrees. velocity (wind channel) value (fig. 2); the curve of the couple coefficient against yaw
has here a large curvature downwards.
