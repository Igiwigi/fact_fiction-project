There are then substantial difficulties in the way of these explanations and of any
others we have been able to think of, e.g., that E-ness is a type of sinistrality not alter-
native to K-ness, but with its own dextral-determining allelomorph. It is certainly
not ‘‘ cytoplasmic ” in the ordinary sense, since both sides of the crosses give the same
results ; nor can it reasonably be supposed to be environmental. Taking one thing
with another, there seem to be two interpretations available. (i) That high E-ness
and K-ness are the ends of a graded series and that all sinistrals have a tendency to
embryonic misdevelopment and the production of phenotypic dextrals, which varies
in different strains and is heritable: this does little more than re-state the facts.
(i) That high H-ness is qualitatively different from the habit of « strains to produce
occasional dextrals, that it depends on a genetic factor, and that its manifestation
is masked when it is associated with K-ness. Our facts are very similar to those described by Wrigut and Eaton (1923) for
otocephaly in in-bred strains of guinea-pigs. The monstrosity varies from a defect in
Meckel’s cartilage to cyclopia and on to an almost headless condition, and the different
forms fall into a single graded series.
