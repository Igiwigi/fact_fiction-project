results that a comparatively very small amount of mechanical force, suddenly applied,
suffices to develope the violent, decompoxition of nitroglycerine; it is therefore not diffi-
cult to understand why this substance, though incapable of detonating gun-cotton, even
when used in considerable quantities, should be itself readily exploded by means of the
latter. It was impossible to determine how small a proportion of gun-cotton would
suffice for that purpose, becanse, in the necessary experiments, the gun-cotton would
have to be placed in very close proximity to, or contact with, the nitroglycerine, in which
case the fulminate-charge required for detonating the gun-cotton would alone much more
than suffice for exploding the nitroglycerine.

The comparatively very great sensitiveness of this substance to explosion through the
agency of a detonation may probably be ascribable in part to its physical character as a
liquid, and in part to the fact that the proportion of oxygen to oxidizable elements is

much more considerable in nitroglycerine than in gun-cotton.



THE HISTORY OF EXPLOSIVE AGENTS. 513

Tn considering the manner in which a detonation operates in determining the violent
explosion of gun-cotton and nitroglycerine in open air, I have, for the sake of simplicity,
confined myself to an examination of the manner in which those particular explosive
substances are affected by the disturbing agency in question. It must not, however, be
