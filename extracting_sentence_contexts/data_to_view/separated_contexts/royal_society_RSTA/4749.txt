‘To determine the total effect
of obturator heating with this new element, experiments were made at a temperature
of about 54°°5 C., similar to those before described, but with the new element of a
flow of cold water through the water jacket. Most of these experiments were made
after the two first series of continuous-flow experiments were concluded, as it was
not discovered till later that a deposition of moisture had taken place which varied in
each experiment. The earlier results were consequently erratic, and it was not till a
much later period that the cause was traced to the fact that the lower surface of the
obturator was so much cooled in the neighbourhood of the cold-water jacket as to
permit of the condensation of water upon it, the evaporation or fall of which
produced irregular results. It was therefore decided to make a third series of continuous-flow experiments. In these the end of the inflow water-casing was surrounded by a short piece of
rubber tubing g', which was shaped to fit it and which was cemented into the end
of the opening through the obturator with rubber solution.
