In doing so,
we develop a framework that articulates the various expla-
nations within a single explanatory model. We shall argue
that an important fulcrum in this is the energetic costs of evol-
ving and maintaining both large brains and large groups: these
are invariably ignored. The test we must apply to any prospective explanation is
that it can explain six key empirical findings: (i) that primates
have larger brains relative to their body size than all other ani-
mals [1]; (ii) that some primates have larger brains than other
primates [1]; (iii) that there is a remarkably robust quantitative
relationship between brain (and especially neocortex) size and
group size in primates (but not other mammals or birds) [5,6];
(iv) that primates have a peculiar form of bonded sociality that
seems to be very different to that of other mammals [7-12],
reflected in the fact that primate societies are highly structured
in network terms (whereas those of most other mammals and
birds are not) [13-16]; (v) that pairbonded monogamy in birds
and mammals is associated with larger than average brain size
for their orders [7,8]; and (vi) that some (but not all) species of
primates exhibit novel technical competences [17,18]. Although many analyses do so, we should not ignore the
relationship between group size and brain size in primates,
because living in groups is extremely costly to animals. This
is so for three reasons.
