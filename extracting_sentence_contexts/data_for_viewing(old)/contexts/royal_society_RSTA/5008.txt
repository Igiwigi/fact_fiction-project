The relationship between Joule and Thomson flourished, although Thomson was far from : a

seems to have discovered some facts of extreme importance, as for instance, that heat is developed : Py
by the friction of fluids’. He also sent Joule’s papers to his brother James Thomson saying that they : s
would astonish him though he felt there must be ‘some great flaws’. In reply, James wrote, ‘Some : g
of Joule’s views have a slight tendency to unsettle one’s mind as to the accuracy of Clapeyron’s 1

principle. If some of the heat can absolutely be turned into mech. eff. Clapeyron may be wrong’.

6. The paddle-wheel experiment

Joule’s paddle-wheel experiment [4] is the most famous of his conservation-of-energy
experiments because, as we now know, it gave the most accurate results for the mechanical
equivalent of heat. The experiment was performed in the cellar of Joule’s house and was
simplicity in itself (see figs. 1-9 of [4]). A cylindrical vessel containing water or mercury was fitted
