C. CHAMBERS ON THE DIRECTION AND INTENSITY

yearly comparisons ; and secondly, that the probable error of a single weekly determina-
tion (that is, of the mean of the first and second obseryation) being +0043 (see
paragraph 19), that of the mean difference, for six and a half years, between the first

and second observations will be less than +:0005 (or=+0048=-, /* xy 2), a

quantity which is less than half the magnitude of the difference that the error is 8UP-
posed to explain. And if it were due to erroneous allowance for temperature of the
large Horizontal-force Magnetometer, it ought to be small when the diurnal range of
temperature is small, and large when the range is large; whilst, in fact, the difference in
question is only *0003 in the half-year October to March, when the range of temperature
is large, and is *0016 in the half-year April to September, when the range of tempera-
ture is 8mall. At the same time the range of the diurnal variation of Horizontal Force
is nearly the same throughout the year, its value for the half-year October to March
being a fourteenth greater than for the half-year April to September, and its mean value
for the year, as shown by the large Horizontal-force Magnetometer, is -00166 of the
whole force. It remains, therefore, if the result be an instrumental one, that the scale-
coefficient adopted tor the large Horizontal-force Magnetometer must be supposed to
be one fourth of itself in excess of the truth : this the writer cannot think possible, and
he hopes s00n to have the opportunity of submitting to the judgment of the Royal
Society evidence (in connexion with a general discussion of the obseryations with this
instrument) which will completely set aside such a supposition.
