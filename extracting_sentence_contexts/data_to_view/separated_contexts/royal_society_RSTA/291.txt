In this case the first and second approximations had
errors of up to 44 and 1 units respectively. Vol. 242. A. 46


354 L. FOX ON THE NUMERICAL SOLUTION

It may be remarked that the maximum error of the first approximation was less in the
first method than in the second, in spite of the fact that a more accurate derivative formula
was used in the latter. The reason lies in the fact that in this example neglected terms in the
differential equation are of opposite sign to those in the boundary condition, and the two
sources of error cancel each other to some extent. As pointed out in previous papers, this is
not a circumstance to be relied on, and, indeed, the corrections are not negligible even at
the smaller interval h = 0-1.
