(d) Topology and cosmology

Another quantum possibility (or rather more like a speculation at the time) was suggested in 1973
by Tryon [122]. He imagined the universe as a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum, appearing
accidentally so to speak ‘from time to time’ and obeying Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.
Thus an infinite lifetime would be associated with zero energy, but the unexplained issue with
this proposal was why the universe had such a large age. But what would be the properties
of a universe created from a fluctuation of the vacuum? A finitely born universe would have
all possible shapes, and the Einstein equations only relate the local properties of space-time
to the overall matter density. The issue of topology of the universe relates to global properties,
possibly observable and in fact something like this could alter the images of observed galaxies
by producing multiple, fainter copies of their images.

Sokolov & Shvartsman [123] and Gott [124] gave lower bounds on the size of a finite universe.
Also Zeldovich & Starobinski [125] studied a flat, finite, universe as a quantum fluctuation and
concluded that it must have an approximate spherical shape to avoid a singularity. Another issue
with all these studies was how to create an infinite model with global non-trivial topology. It
is difficult not to take seriously any model that allows for some mild form of non-trivial global


topology. Today the problem of observationally detecting some aspect of large-scale topology is
an active one [126].
