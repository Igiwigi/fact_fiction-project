is non-invertible, necessarily have (4) < 0—see also remark 1.5. See figure 1 for an example of a numerically obtained stable pinned 1-pulse solution supported
by the scalar version of (1.3). The fact that all eigenvalues of a pinned n-pulse solution of the
scalar version of (1.3) are real-valued stems from the fact that the associated stability problem is
a Sturm-Liouville problem ([27], e.g.). A direct consequence is that, unlike their counterparts in
two-component slow-fast RDEs ([24], e.g.), pinned n-pulse solutions of the scalar version of (1.3)
cannot undergo Hopf bifurcations. A straightforward computation also shows that the matrix
M(0) (1.6) is non-invertible if and only if {ayy is a degenerate solution of (1.5).
