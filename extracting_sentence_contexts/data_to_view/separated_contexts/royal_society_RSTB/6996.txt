Mansfield and
Szent-Gyérgyi (1920) observed that acapnia (deprivation of carbon dioxide by per-
fusion with alkali) affects first those parts of the heart with greatest automatism, namely
the sinus in the frog and toad and the S-A and A-V nodes in the mammal, suggesting
some chemical difference between these parts and the rest of the myocardium. While
we cannot explain the uneven nuclear reduction of the silver salt in different parts of
the salamander heart, it is of interest to note that Drury (1936) and others quoted by
him found that nucleic acid derivatives have a depressor action on the cardiac con-
ducting systems of both cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates. Various factors, chemical, physical and physico-chemical, have from time to time
been held by different workers to act as the origin of the heart’s ‘internal stimulus’,
and to account for the fact that the heart of either a cold- or warm-blooded animal is
able to maintain rhythmical beats for a long time after all nervous, vascular and
supporting connexions between the heart and the rest of the animal’s body have been
severed, provided that the heart is perfused with a liquid containing certain inorganic
salts in proper proportions. This automaticity of the heart has been attributed at
different times to the following: metabolic products of the activity of the intracardiac
nerve cells; metabolic materials elaborated by the heart muscle during the resting
period in the cardiac cycle and destroyed during systole; inorganic cations (sodium,
potassium, calcium) and their interaction with certain cellular contents of the heart
muscle; changes in the hydrogen-ion concentration at interfaces within the cardiac
muscle structure; variations in the permeability of the lipoid-containing cell surfaces;
rhythmic building up and discharging of a potential difference across semipermeable
membranes depending on differences in hydrogen-ion concentration within the cardiac
muscle cells and the fluid bathing them; carbon dioxide; oxydation-reduction reactions
in the muscle cells; ‘nodal extracts’; various heart ‘hormones’; and electrical varia-
tions in the cardiac muscle fibres. These theories have been reviewed by McDonald
and McDonald (1933) and none appears to be entirely satisfactory as the explanation
of the automaticity of the heart.
