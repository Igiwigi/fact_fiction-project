The good agreement between experimental and synthetic interferometry images justifies our
use of these simulated density profiles in the PIC simulations described in §2bii.

(b) Proton radiography

The doses received by a stack of RCF were calculated using the procedure described in §2ai. The
Monge-Ampére solver of Brown et al. [37] was applied to the resulting doses and the result is


shown in figure 9. The doses contain large-scale structure due to the intensity modulations of
the initial proton beam, which are compensated for using a simple high-pass filtering method. If
this pre-processing step is not used, large fictitious transverse magnetic fields manifest, which are
attributable to this large-scale beam structure. These large fields can obscure the desired plasma
fields, but high-pass filtering used prevents this issue. The more statistically rigorous approach
presented by Kasim et al. [46] would be worth exploring in future work, for comparison to our
simple filter.

The results of this analysis applied to proton radiographs obtained from channelling shots—in
which the short pulse was injected into the plasma—are shown in figure 10. Magnetic fields are
observed in a narrow region around the laser propagation axis—a key marker of laser channel
formation as demonstrated in figure 5. These fields persist over long times, as figure 7 indicates
they are expected to. Panels (c) and (d) of figure 10 show clear evidence of channel formation
matching the opening angle of the f/3 beam, and corresponding features are present in panel (b),
though they are quite washed out. This is likely due to the large relative energy range of protons
