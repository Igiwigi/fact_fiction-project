2 they accord closely with the results deduced from the chronoscope observations. But

& when a rapidly lighting or © brisante” powder is used, the products of combustion' of
< the portion first ignited are projected with a very high velocity through the interstices

= of the charge, or between the charge and the bore ; and on meeting with any resistance
5 their vis vive is reconverted into pressure, producing the anomalous local pressures to
-2 which we have drawn attention.

S We have pretty clear proof that, when this intense local action is set up, the gases
EV are in a state of violent disturbance, and that waves of pressure pass backwards and
= forwards from one end of the charge to the other, the action occasionally lasting the
EY whole time that the hot is in the bore. In fact, with the rapidly burning, and in a
= less degree eyen with the slower burning powders, motion is communicated to the pro-
EZ Jectile not by a steady, gradually decreasing pressure like the expansive action of steam
H in a cylinder, but by a series of impulses more or less violent.

65 The time during which these intense local pressures act is of course very minute ; but
= ﬆtill the existence of the pressures is registered by the crusher-gauges. The chrono-
E 8copic records, on the other hand, which are, s to speak, an integration of the infini-
= tesimal impulses communicated to the shot, afford little or no indication of the intensity

of the local pressures, but give reliable information as to the mean gascous pressure 0N
the base of the shot.
