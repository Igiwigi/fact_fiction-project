pronounced for measurement as such, though the lines are by no means equally spaced.
(The carbon are shows a very similar appearance in this region.) The yellow-green
fluting begins with a series of rather faint lines, but stronger lines appear in the more
refrangible part, and the components can be traced to the head of the next group.
The green fluting beginning at 5211 also has its strongest lines a considerable distance
from the first head, and becomes very faint as it approaches the blue band. Still
greater complexity is shown by the blue group of flutings, which has its greatest

intensity in the region about 4780, and can be followed to the violet head at 4371.
The spectrum, in fact, shows an almost unbroken succession of lines at very short
intervals throughout the entire visible spectrum, but the lines are mostly faint, except
in the definite flutings to which reference has been made.

The ultra-violet spectrum, of which no measurements have yet been undertaken,
also exhibits a great number of lines distributed throughout its whole extent. There
is a well-marked fluting, very similar to the one in the green, with its head about
2430, and fading off on the more refrangible side. There is also an interesting series
of double lines in the region about 2940 to 3100, in which the lines close up towards
the side of shorter wave-length, whereas the somewhat similar series which can be
traced in the green and yellow-green flutings converge towards the red.

Another feature of the spectrum, which cannot be very clearly seen in the
