In the case of an india-rubber roller on an india-rubber surface the lateral compression
in the surface of the roller at D is greater than that in the plane, and the expansion at
P is not 80 large, and hence there is slipping, and the roller will not accomplish its
geometrical distance. In this explanation T have referred to india-rubber because it is much more easy to
conceive the effects on it than on a hard s8ubstance like iron, the expansion and contraction
of which is quite inappreciable to our senses ; the reasoning, however, applies equally
well to all elastic substances, and is quite independent of their hardness or softness. That friction is sufficient to preyent the expansion of iron at a surface against which it

is squeezed out is amply proved by the fact that when a block of iron, hot or cold, is
8queezed on an anvil the iron bulges out in the middle, as shown in fig. 4.

Lxperimental Verification of the Figures. The figures which illustrate the foregoing remarks are not altogether ideal, for they
have been verified to a certain extent by experiments on india-rubber; for instance, by
drawing vertical lines on the edge of a plate of india-rubber, and then observing these
lines as the roller passed along as near as possible to this edge; also by observing lines
drawn in the same way on the edge of an india-rubber roller.
