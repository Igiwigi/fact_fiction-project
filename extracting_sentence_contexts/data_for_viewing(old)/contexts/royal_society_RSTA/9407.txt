Expressions for the Velocities After an Encounter.

§4 (F) We have thus indicated how the final molecular velocities c’,, c’, are to be
determined (cf. 43) in terms of the initial velocities ¢,, ¢ or ¢), Cx together with p and e
(these being the eight independent variables of an encounter). This has been done
by showing how c’, depends upon ¢p, p and e; it has in fact been shown that the
spherical polar co-ordinates of ¢’,, referred to cy, and the plane ¢,, cy, as initial line and
plane, are Op, x12 (a function of p and Cy) and e. Hence we may at once write down

of ¢, Cp, p and e, as follows :—
