formed ? If the pigment-cells are migrating towards the eye, as I believe, the pigment
must be derived from some source outside it ; and in this connection it is interesting to
note the occurrence in the dura mater, in the immediate neighbourhood of the pineal
eye, of numerous gigantic, much branched pigment-cells filled with pigment-granules
similar to those which occur in the pineal eye. These branched cells all lie outside
the outer capsule of the eye, as represented in fig. 10, and they are easily visible
scattered around the parietal foramen when the inner aspect of the cranial roof is
examined with a pocket-lens. These cells may possibly be the source of the pineal
eye pigment ; but, on the other hand, they may themselves derive their pigment
from the pineal eye, and in either case the pigmented wandering cells may serve as
go-betweens. Similar large, stellate, branched pigment-cells, however, may be found
in the dwra mater in situations far removed from the pineal eye, and I have even
seen them in the neighbourhood of the infundibulum, while the fact that such cells
also occur in the choroid coat of the lateral eye is particularly significant in this
connection.

In the case of the ordinary (lateral) Vertebrate eye it is, I think, generally believed
that the pigment originates in situ in the pigment epithelium. If so, we should
naturally expect a similar origin for the pigment of the pineal eye, and perhaps the
fact that pigment may appear in the apex of the pineal sac when the latter extends
forwards into the light (figs. 8, 9) tends at first sight to confirm this expectation. On
the other hand, the development of the pigment cannot be entirely dependent on the
presence of light, for it appears in the embryo, both in the pineal eye and in the
pineal sac, long before hatching, while the egg is still buried in the nest. Moreover,
the fact that wandering pigment-cells occur both in the cavity of the eye (vitreous
