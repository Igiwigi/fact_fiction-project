M is called the between-subject
orthomodular lattice. As discussed previously, in terms of current terminology, M has the algebraic
structure of a ‘quantum logic’, which is an algebraic generalization of the ‘logic’ described by
Birkhoff & von Neumann [6] for quantum mechanics. The approach to modelling experimental phenomena developed in this article is expressed in =
theorem 4.1 and the fact that the lattice M differs from that of Birkhoff & von Neumann in the : 3S
following manners:

— this article’s approach is designed for behavioural modelling while Birkhoff’s & von :
Neumann’s approach was designed for modelling quantum mechanics; [4
— the lattice M has set-theoretic complementation as its complementation operation, DN
whereas the Hilbert space modelling uses an orthocomplementation operation that is [GS
not set-theoretic complementation, except for the degenerate case of a one-dimensional Ss
space; .
— for ortholattices, Birkhoff & von Neumann generalized the distributive law,

An(BUC)=(AnB)u(AnQ),
to the modular law,
ifACB, thenBn(AuUC)=(BNA)u(BNC). Lattice M generalizes further by generalizing, for ortholattices, the modular law to the
orthomodular law. (It is a well-known theorem of lattice theory that for an ortholattice,
the distributive law implies the modular law which implies the orthomodular law.); and

— most importantly, lattice M arose directly out of considerations about how between-
subjects experiments are conceptualized, run and analysed. Birkhoff & von Neumann’s
orthocomplemented modular event space arose out of a mathematical formulation
of quantum mechanics that assumed the existence of a Hilbert space as part of the
formulation.

Although paradigms in quantum mechanics and behavioural science are about radically different
subject matters, they can generate event spaces that share much algebraic structure.
