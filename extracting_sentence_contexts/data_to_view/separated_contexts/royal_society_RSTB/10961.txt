The results reveal that brain activity during
professional mathematical reflection spares perisylvian language-related
brain regions as well as temporal lobe areas classically involved in general
semantic knowledge. Instead, mathematical reflection recycles bilateral intra-
cognition, neuroscience parietal and ventral temporal regions involved in elementary number sense. Even simple fact retrieval, such as remembering that ‘the sine function is
periodical’ or that ‘London buses are red’, activates dissociated areas for
math versus non-math knowledge. Together with other fMRI and recent intra-
cranial studies, our results indicated a major separation between two brain
networks for mathematical and non-mathematical semantics, which goes a
long way to explain a variety of facts in neuroimaging, neuropsychology
