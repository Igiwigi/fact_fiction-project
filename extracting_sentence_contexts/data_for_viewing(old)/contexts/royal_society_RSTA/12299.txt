Thermopile experiment suggested by Fizeau; in two alternative forms.

19. But it is a serious question whether the reasoning establishing the effect
quite sound. It is not unlikely that motion may affect the radiating power of
source. In fact, the theory of exchanges almost necessitates something of the ki
else the two faces of an enclosure would become unequal in temperature by reason

Hence, if, as in fig. 5, we consider a pair of thermopiles with a hot body half-y

* The suggestion is quoted in a comprehensive, but to me not very intelligible, treatise on the wh
subject of aberration : ‘ Astronomische Undulationstheorie,’ by Professor Dr. Kerreter, of Bonn.

+ Barrour Srewarr (‘ Brit. Assoc. Report,’ 1871, Sects. p. 45), argued that this inequality of temp
ture actually occurred; and, since motion thus afforded an available heat engine, he deduced
ethereal friction, dissipating energy. But, as Lord Ray.eron points ont (in his Article on ‘ Aberratior
‘Nature,’ March 1892), it is far more likely that motion should alter radiating and absorbing po
