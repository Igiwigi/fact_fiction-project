The sluggishness introduced by the platinum also
extends here the temperature range over which the transformations occur as compared
with carbon steels. In 17/C.1-6 with higher platinum content, 2-50 per cent., the same features are
observed to a more marked degree, the critical ranges being lowered in temperature
by 20째 to 30째, and the ranges further widened. With nickel 2-18 per cent. and gold 0-75 per cent. in specimen 22/C.2-2, there is a
lowering of the critical ranges of about 40째, the ranges also being widened by about
20째 ; both these facts are about what might be expected from the nickel addition alone,
so that the gold has apparently had no material effect.

(k) Thermal Expansion. It is one of the advantages of the dilatometric method of determining critical
temperature ranges that it provides at the same time information as to the coefficients
of thermal expansion at various temperatures. From the Chevenard curves, therefore,
these coefficients were ascertained for the various specimens tested.
