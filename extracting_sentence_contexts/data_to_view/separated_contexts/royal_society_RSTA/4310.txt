4 The view which was taken in previous papers concerning the dense fogs which are
“Sbtained with expansions exceeding the second limit v./v, = 1°38, was that the degree
woe supersaturation is then great enough to cause condensation to take place indepen-
Alently of all nuclei other than the molecules of gas or vapour themselves. According
‘Ho this view no effect is to be expected on applying an electric field when expansions
So great as this are used. In fact, the same apparatus being used as before, no
Blifference could be detected in the appearance of these fogs, whether they were pro-
Bluced in the absence of any electric field, or with a difference of potential of
P25 volts, between the tin and water surfaces, these being 1 centim. apart.
