102 PR. JOULE ON SOME THERMO-DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS.

34. In addition to the above, my own experience has led me to the curious fact that a
piece of india-rubber, softened by warmth, may be exposed to the zero of FAuRENAEIT
for an hour or more without losing its pliability ; but that a few days roat at a tempera-
ture considerably above the freezing-point will cause it to become rigid.

35. The ends of a piece of elastic india-rubber, about ths of an inch. square, were
attached to an apparatus by means of which it could be stretched by various weights. A thermo-electric junction of thin copper and iron wires was placed in an orifice pierced
through the centre of the slip; and at either side, at ths of an inch distance from one
another, pins were stuck which afforded the means of knowing the exact length to which
the rubber was stretched.
