It is generally assumed that this component consists of some sort of as-yet
unknown particle associated with the high energy physics interactions (supersymmetric particles
were the most favoured candidates, but the most recent LHC experiments failed to discover any). One should also note that even in the presence of such particles, ‘flat’ rotation curves demand
rather fine tuning between the amount and distributions of luminous and dark matter. The second issue concerns the apparent lack of deceleration in the expansion of the Universe,
in fact an acceleration, at late times. This was determined by measuring the flux of a large number
of type Ia supernovae, considered standard candles, that occur at a specific redshifts z and forming
the ensuing redshift-magnitude relation. Fits of the evolution of the Universe to this relation


is best achieved by adding a cosmological term, A/3, to the equations that describe the scale
factor evolution of an homogeneous and isotropic universe [1].
