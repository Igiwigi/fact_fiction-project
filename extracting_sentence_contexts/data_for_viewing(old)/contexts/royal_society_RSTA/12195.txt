a vibrator, and would be subject to intense radiation of its energy. That howey
does not seem to be the case. We may on the contrary propound the general
principle that whenever the motion of any dynamical system is determined b
imposed conditions at its boundaries or elsewhere, which are of a steady character,
a steady motion of the system will usually correspond, after the preliminary
oscillations, if any, have disappeared by radiation or viscosity. A system of electrons
moving steadily across the medium, or rotating steadily round a centre, would thus
carry a steady configuration of strain along with it; and no radiation will be pro-
pagated away except when this steady state of motion is disturbed.

It is in fact easy to investigate the characteristics of this strain-configuration
when the electric system is moving with constant velocity, say in the direction of the
axis of a with velocity c. By § 97, the dynamical equations of the surrounding
medium are

(p-#h) (Lgl) =0,

referred to co-ordinates fixed in space. The equations determining the disturbance
relative to the electric system are derived by changing the co-ordinate « to a new
relative co-ordinate x’, equal to « — ct; this leaves spacial differentiations unaltered,
but changes d/dt into d/dt — om thus giving
