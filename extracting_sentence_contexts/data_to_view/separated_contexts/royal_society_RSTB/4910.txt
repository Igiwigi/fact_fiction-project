It is Btn aah,
not possible to ascertain with any certainty whether these specimens, viii ae he
which are almost always detached from the peduncles, show the jase, x 8,
natural mode of dehiscence of the fruits, but the evidence seems to
point strongly to this rupture of the fruit wall having been caused by the weight of
the superposed sediments before the matrix had become consolidated or the fruit dry. These ruptured fruits seldom contain much of the muddy matrix which should have
filled them if they were open at the time when they were buried, and it would be difficult
to account for the presence of seeds in the fissure except on the view of rupture in situ
by pressure. If this is the case it seems to indicate that the fruits had a somewhat
fleshy nature with a thin outer wall, and were, in fact, berries. From some of the ruptured fruits the contents, consisting of a number (8-10) of more
or less mature seeds and a large quantity of small rounded bodies, had been extruded. These latter are of somewhat varied shape, being generally ovate or pear-shaped, but
occasionally more or less spherical.
