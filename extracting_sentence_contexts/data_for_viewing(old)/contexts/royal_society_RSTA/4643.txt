sea-ice cover is thin (1m or less) and has retreated far from the Eurasian coastline (figure 2). Its
geographical location is very similar to that simulated by the Community Climate System Model
for the year 2040 after a transition to nearly seasonal sea-ice cover described in Holland et al. [3].

For PERENN, sediment of Beaufort, East Siberian and Laptev Sea origin is mainly redeposited
on the Yukon, Alaskan and Eurasian shelf with some deposition across the shelf break extending
outwards towards the central Arctic (figure 3). This supports the suggestion from Krylov et al.
[8] that with todayâ€™s drift speed and sea-ice circulation pattern, sediment from the Eurasian
coast cannot reach the North Pole ACEX core location in a single season. For SEASON, sediment
deposition again mainly occurs on the continental shelf break, and also extends far along the path
of the Transpolar drift stream, reaching the ACEX core site and recirculating also in the western
branch of the Beaufort Gyre (in the case of Eurasian sediment) (figure 4). Note that the transport is
far greater despite the fact that the ice season is much reduced in length (January-June in SEASON
as opposed to October-July in PERENN). The main reason for the faster drift speed is the thinner
sea-ice cover and the corresponding smaller sea-ice interaction term.
