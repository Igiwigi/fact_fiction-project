The roots of the tusks extend back at least to the level of the second premolar. When
the jaws are closed the tusks passed down on either side of the narrowest part of the
symphysis of the mandible, which with the lower tusks must have projected about
29 em. in front of the extreme anterior end of the skull. The remainder of the upper
dentition agrees closely with the description already published, but this specimen
shows that the anterior upper premolar (pm. 2) is separated a little from pm. 3, and
projects considerably below it, being raised on a prominence of the alveolar border ;
in fact, this tooth appears to some extent to have assumed the characters of a canine,
and may have performed the functions of one. The mandible (Plate 31, figs. 1, 2) associated with the skull just described is quite
complete and differs in no important respect from the mandibles of Paleomastodon
wintoni described in the ‘ Catalogue of the Tertiary Vertebrata of the Faytim,’ p. 157. About the anterior 18 cm., or, including the lower tusks, 29 em. projected in front of
the anterior end of the skull, when the mouth was closed.
