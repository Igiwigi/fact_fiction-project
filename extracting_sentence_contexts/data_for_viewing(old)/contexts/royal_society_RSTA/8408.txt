moved from Â¢, through this intermediate position to a point, d, slightly beyond. In
this position, the tendency to slip on the 111 plane is now slightly the greater. Whilst
no general indication of slip in this direction on this plane at this stage was obtained, it
is considered likely that the broad bands previously referred to (see p. 8, and
photograph No. 6) were connected with this slip. After 10,000 reversals of -- 2-14
tons/inch* nominal stress, the specimen suddenly necked and two systems of slip
bands were observed, such as would be consistent with slip on these planes. In fig. 3
it will be seen that the axis of the specimen had now moved back to e, which is slightly
towards the original side of the symmetrical position. This indicates that the amount
of slipping on the 111 plane, during this stage, was greater than on the 11] plane.
From the above consideration it is concluded that during the final stages of the test, slipping
had proceeded alternately on these planes, the axis of the specimen moving from one side
to the other of the neutral position. The fact that the axis moves through the neutral
position a certain indeterminate amount before slip commences on the next set of planes
now subjected to a greater shear stress, indicates that the effect of slip on one plane is
to increase the resistance to slip on other planes which intersect it. In other words,

the effect of slipping produces a transverse hardening effect in addition to its known
hardening effects in its own plane.
