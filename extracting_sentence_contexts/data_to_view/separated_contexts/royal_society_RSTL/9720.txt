G. F. RODWELL ON THE EFFECTS OF HEAT ON CERTAIN

The specific gravity of the iodide in the molten condition is 5*6247,

The fact that a 8ubstance may possess two or three different coefficients of expansion
has apparently only been observed hitherto in the case of snch substances as fusible
alloy, because in determining the coefficients of 8olid bodies temperatures exceeding
100* C. have rarely been employed. Paraffine or ceresine if used as a heating medium
will allow the determination of coefficients to a temperabure of 340? C., and, un-
doubtedly, many bodies if thus examined would be found to present anomalies similay
to those remarked in the case of the iodides of lead and mercury.
