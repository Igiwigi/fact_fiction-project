diameters. The microspores are about 0031, and macrospores occur as large as *01,
most of them equalling '0093. The latter exhibit an outer sporangial wall, a, as well
as an inner one, b, whilst a dark-coloured mass, c, exists in the centre of most of the
examples. The outer wall of fig. 26 has not been intersected on both its surfaces on
the plane of its maximum diameter ; hence it appears thicker in the figure than it is
in reality.

It is scarcely necessary to say that this discovery of macrospores and miscrospores in
Calamostachys Binneyana supplies another link connecting this strobilus with the Lyco-
podiacer in the same measure that it separates the fruit from the Zquizetacee. That
no plant belonging to the latter order ever possessed both macrospores and microspores
is more than we can venture to affirm ; but that no living representative of the group
is known to do 80 is an nnquestionable factâ€”hence to include an heterosporous
Calamostachys in the Equisetaceous order will involve 80 large an alteration in the
definition of the characteristics of this order as would practically involve the creation
of a new one. On the other hand, this discovery strengthens my old conviction that
the true affinities of this strobilus are with the Lycopodiacee. The verticillate arrange-
ments of the fruit, and of what I believe to be the leaves of this plant (Asterophyllites
or Sphenophyllum) constitute no difficulty preventing us from accepting this con-
clusion. BRONGNIART long ago pointed out how commonly a verticillate foliage
occurred amongst living Lycopods.* Pig. 27 represents the best specimen I have seen
of a section which has passed tangentially through the margins of three of the
horizontal barren disks, t, and revealed the form of the bracts, t', which ascend from
each of these margins. The specimen is in Mr. ArrxeN's cabinet.
