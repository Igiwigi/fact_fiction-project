There is, in fact, very little to distinguish them, but the horizons are so widely
apart that a separate specific designation seems called for. I have therefore named
the Burntisland form Lepidocarpon Wildianum, associating it with the name of
Mr. Georce Wi1p, who has borne so important a part in the elucidation of these
fossils. It is a fact of some interest that this curious seed-like form of Lycopodiaceous
fructification should have already appeared at so ancient a period as that of the
Calciferous Sandstone deposits, which belong to the lowest strata of the Carboniferous
Formation. At present, Lepidocarpon Wildianum has only been found in the form of
detached specimens, in the mature, seed-like condition. Further search in the rich
material from this locality will no doubt reveal other stages of this fructification.
