contributions to the measured spectra, such as pulse duration and power variations, along with
spectral features of the set-up itself, as well as the dispersion of x Â©) for bulk silicon. Our nonlinear
spectroscopy set-up has an option for measuring the linear transmittance spectra by focusing
white light to a 201m wide spot on the sample plane and consecutively measuring its spectrum
using an IR spectrometer.

All measurements are carried out under normal incidence and with all the beams polarized
along the side of the sample periodicity cell. The numerical aperture for the pump beam was
equal to 0.15.

(c) Estimation of third-harmonic output via local fields integration

The fact of the higher TH yield upon pumping the MD resonances if compared with the ED
resonance is supported by estimating the overall nonlinear polarization within the nanodiscs.
This has been done by integrating the local fields over the volume of the nanodisc.


To simulate the nanodisc response to external radiation, we implement a model using 4 |
FDTD SOLUTIONS software by Lumerical Solutions, Inc. This model includes a plane wave

pulse with a wide spectral range (0.8-1.4;1m) as an external radiation source located inside 3
the silica substrate. For a Si nanodisc, dimensions are set equal to those of the experiment, : a
namely the height is 260nm, and the diameter is 360nm. After calculating the electromagnetic :g

field components outside and inside the disc, we integrate the Cartesian components of the
