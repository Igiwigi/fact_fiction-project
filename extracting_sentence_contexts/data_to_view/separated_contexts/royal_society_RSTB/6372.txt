If this is applied, for example, to the Carmyllie and Cairnconnan beds,
the Senni beds, and to the Rhynie Chert, it would involve profound readjustments
in the views of geologists as to the conditions of accumulation of the Old Red Sand-
stone. These difficulties do not arise if, as seems probable, Prototaxites and
Nematothallus were land-plants of peculiar type. Whatever the ultimate conclusion may be on the question raised here as to the
continental origin of the Downtonian flora as a whole, this study of the plant-
remains has added a number of facts of botanical interest to our growing knowledge
of early plants. It has added some details to our knowledge of Pachytheca and
of Prototaxites. It has confirmed the presence of Parka in the Downtonian.
