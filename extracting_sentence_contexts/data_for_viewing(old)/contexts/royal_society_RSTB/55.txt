Microscopic appearance.—Under a high power this is seen to be a short fat bacillus
about one-and-a-half to twice as long as broad. It frequently exhibits a median
transverse division, which can, however, be only well seen with a very high magnifying
power (3/5 oil-immersion), 1,500 times. Sometimes the bacilli hang together in chains
of three and four. The average length of a pair is about 3°4y ; the ends are rounded and
sometimes pointed, especially in those cases where division has taken place. Not


ON SOME NEW MICRO-ORGANISMS OBTAINED FROM AIR. 273

unfrequently there are found forms of very peculiar shape. Some are bent and often
club-shaped, and present other irregularities in thickness. That these forms are only
modifications of the same organism is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found
along with the ordinary forms in one and the same colony when the organism is
submitted to plate-cultivation. These forms do not appear to be due to involution, as
they occur in fresh cultivations and stain well. Neither were spores observed in these
nor in any of the other forms. A very large number of microscopic preparations were
made from different cultivations of this organism in order to confirm these observa-
tions. (See Plate 20, fig. 2, No. 2b.)
In drop-cultivations the bacillus is seen to be non-motile.
