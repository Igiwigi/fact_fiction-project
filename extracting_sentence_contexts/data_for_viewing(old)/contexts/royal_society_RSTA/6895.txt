having no point in common with another, while D is an unrestricted space of the same
or of lower dimensions.

It is well known that three such spaces 4, B, C which have no point in common are
met by 00%"! straight lines, each line passing through one point a, b, ¢ in each space.
These lines in their aggregate form a scroll (to use Room’s word for such a locus). It is
a locus # of k dimensions and of order k, a V let us say. The manner in which an
arbitrary

pace [A’ —1], where k’ <k, meets, or fails to meet, this 7 is quite complicated,
but it gives a precise analogy to the behaviour of a matrix or matrix pencil. In par-
ticular, latent roots of the characteristic equation of a matrix are connected with the
cross-ratios of four collinear points on A, B, C, D: and the fact that spaces D exist
which fail to meet the scroll 4 corr

sponds to the existence of certain singular matrix
pencils.

The elementary divisors were first established by Sylvester (1850-54), and their
properties were first fully demonstrated by Weierstrass (1868). The theory of the sin-
gular pencil, with its minimal indices of two kinds is due to Kronecker (1874). Segre
gave various geometrical accounts of the theory of Weierstrass (Segre 1884, 1887 and
further references) and of Kronecker (Segre 18846,¢), but in the latter case confined
his treatment to that of pencils of general cones whose matrices are necessarily sym-
metrical and therefore yield identical pairs of minimal indices. I am not aware that
