(c) Electroencephalography recording and analysis

The EEG was recorded at a sampling rate of 256 Hz using a 64-
channel Refa 8 amplifier and 64-channel Waveguard EEG caps
(both from ANT Neuro, Enschede, The Netherlands). A band-
pass filter from 0.5 to 20 Hz (with a slope of 48 dB/oct each)
and a notch filter of 50 Hz were applied. Following that, a raw
data inspection was conducted manually to reject technical arte-
facts from the EEG, before an independent component analysis
(ICA; Infomax algorithm) was conducted. Using ICA, horizontal
and vertical eye movement, blinks and pulse artefacts were
corrected in the EEG data. After these pre-processing steps,
cue-locked segments were formed. Only correct trials were
included in the data analysis; i.e. Go trials were included when-
ever a correct response was given in a time window of 800 ms of
stimulus onset. NoGo trials were included when there was
no response within 800 ms of stimulus onset. Segments started
500 ms prior to the locking point (cue onset was set to time
point 0) and ended 1000 ms thereafter, resulting in an overall seg-
ment length of 1500 ms. Afterwards, an automated artefact
rejection was applied for all the segments. Activity below
