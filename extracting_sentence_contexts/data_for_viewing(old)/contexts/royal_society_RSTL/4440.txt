star, was also discovered by Mr. JonxsToxE SToxty when observing alone with
the 3-feet telescope: I have since seen it several times and sketched it. The com-
ponents of : Orionis bave not been laid down micrometrically, or even with care
by the eye, but the dark cavity with respect to the stars is faithfully represented.
If the dark cavity was symmetrical with the stars, it might perhaps be thought
by some that the phenomenon was optical, but as it is the thing is impossible. A
small double star n # has similar openings, but they are not 80 easily seen. These
openings appear to be of the same character as the opening within the bright stars
of the trapezium of Orion, the stars being at the edges of the opening. Had the
stars been situated all together within the openings, the suspicion would perhaps
have suggested itself more strongly that the nebula had been absorbed by the stars.
As it is, I think we can hardly fail to conclude that the nebula is in some way con-
nected with these bright stars, in fact that they are equidistant, and therefore, if the
inquiries about parallax, now proceeding with so much activity, should result in
giving us the distances of these bright stars, we shall have the distance of this nebula.

The long elliptic or lenticular nebulz are very numerous; I have given three sketches
of remarkable objects of this class: the appearance of Plate XXXVII, fig. 7 suggests
the idea of an elliptic annular system seen very obliquely. A series of very elliptic
Shells enveloping the nucleus, seen somewhat obliquely, would perhaps also present
the same aspect. The dark chink in Plate XXXVII. fig. 8 might indicate either a
real opening, the system being an elliptic ring, or merely a line of comparative dark-
ness, the section through the axis of a very long narrow elliptic shell. In Plate
XXXVII. fig. 9 there is a wellmarked stratification, which might possibly be the
appearance, Plate XXXVIL. fig. 7, on the first supposition, would present if seen in
