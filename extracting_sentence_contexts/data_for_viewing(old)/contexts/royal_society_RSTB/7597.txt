Barn owl ( Tyto alba). This bird often roosted in derelict cottages among the plantations
though few were heard on Glasgwm.

Ten fence posts were inspected for pellets on Glasgwm, though this scheme (Elton 1942,
p- 192) was not started until January 1938. Many old pellets were found then (one
included a vole ring), but only four new pellets had been produced by February, none by
March, two by May and none thereafter during 1938-9.

APPENDIX 2. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM MARKING AND RECAPTURE

The results of marking and retrapping cannot be interpreted without a careful use of
the facts in ยง 5 about the sampling procedure and characteristics of the animals. Results
on block E cannot be used because immigration and emigration may not have been
negligible, and old animals cannot be grouped with young because they had different
death-rates, both natural and induced. Hence the present analysis is restricted to the fate
of those young which were alive on block Q in August and September 1937 (table 12).
Even among these animals there were differences in death-rates which affect the calcula-
tions. The most important are the apparently better survival of voles in the August sample,
and of those in lines 9 to 15 which alone constituted the December sample. A big change
in rate of survival half-way through the experiment makes it necessary, for certain
purposes, to consider the data in two groups. Ideally we would wish to subdivide the data
still further: into those for males and females, for the two sections and for smaller units of
time. However, such procedure would mean a great loss of precision, and the individual
estimates would not be as useful, given the present data, as the more general conclusions
