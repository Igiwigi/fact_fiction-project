size proved to be 200 [23], much larger than the number 15 typically quoted for regular tension-
compression testing [24]. The size-independent fracture energy proved to be 15Jm~? [15], this
value also significantly larger than the 1Jm~? still being often quoted in the literature. The
requisite LEFM test size for the edge-cracked square plate geometry (for loading durations of less
than 600s and an average grain size of 1.5cm), was found to be greater than 3 m [23]. Size effect
analyses of sub-ranges of the data showed that unless the specimen sizes tested were themselves
sufficiently large, the true nature of the scale effect was not revealed. The associated fracture
process zone sizes for L=3,30 and 80m were determined to be Apz = 120,160 and 100mm,
respectively. The short-time modulus for the last two sizes were determined to be given by
E39 =6.4GPa and Ego = 4.7 GPa. The smaller short-time elastic modulus for the 80m test size
is a reflection of a more compliant specimen which results in an earlier termination of the process
zone development. The role played by the short-time elastic modulus is significant, as revealed
by the fact that Ato aâ€œ Alpe x E39/Ego. The greater compliance for the 80 m test size is caused by a
slightly slower loading rate: Kgg = 0.17 kPa,/ms~! while K39 = 0.22 kPa/ms7!.

The edge-notched-square-plates (ENSPs) tested at Resolute were tested in load or CMOD
control. Two-dimensional self-similarity was maintained (with A/L=0.3). In load control,
unstable cracking ensued at peak load, with the stable development of the fracture process zone
(FPZ) terminated at that point. A size effect analysis [25] confirmed that the FPZs developed in
the critical size region (0.5 < L < 3) also scaled self-similarly. A key piece of information obtained
from the tests at Resolute was that the transitional test size was of order 3 m. The other significant
finding was that the VFCM could model the fracture experiments, with an invariant SSC being
obtained for the tests at and above 3 m. The times to peak load in the tests at Resolute were of
