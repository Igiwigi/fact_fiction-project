Their condition in Hyrax is more like that of the generality of mammals and
is doubtless the less specialized of the two. Anatomical differences between Elephas maximus and Loxodonta africana are relatively few,
although they differ in average size, in the shape of the head and in the more ‘rangy’
appearance of the African elephant, with its relatively longer legs and evident adaptation
for more rapid movement in open country. The two animals in fact differ more obviously
than a list of diagnostic characters of each would suggest. The present material includes two
specimens of the African ‘forest elephant’ (nos. 21 and 22), which has sometimes been
described as a distinct species of Loxodonta. The characters and status of ‘L. cyclotis’ have
been discussed by Allen (1936) and by Morrison-Scott (1947).
