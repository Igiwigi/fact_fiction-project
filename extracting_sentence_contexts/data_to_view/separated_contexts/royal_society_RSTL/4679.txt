If the declination of both were westerly,
then the north needle would precede the south. $

direction of the needle's motions, as is the case generally, and if my hopes are well-

amount of force required for the observed declinations at given hours. I have
endeavoured to obtain experimental evidence of the difference of action of oxygen
and nitrogen on needles subjected to the earth's power, but baye not yet succeeded. This however is not surprising, since a saturated solution of protosulphate of iron
has failed under the same circumstances.
