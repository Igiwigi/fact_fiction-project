In the anterior lateral wall of the prosoma, directly underneath the point of attachment
of the attrahens muscle to the scutal plate, is a tendinous sheet (figure 6), and to this
is attached a whole series of muscles which must serve to hold in the flexible lateral
prosomal walls. To give these muscles separate names could only lead to subsequent
confusion; their homologies, and hence names, must wait until the anatomy of Pollicipes
or some other more primitive form has been worked out. In the meantime, in order to
discuss the functioning of this muscle system, I have numbered the muscles rather than
named them.

Muscle 1 runs from the lateral sheet directly inwards and slightly downwards to attach
alongside the pleats and just above the point of attachment of the anterior section of the
dorsal longitudinal muscles. It is possible that it represents, in fact, the most ventral
constituent of this series. Muscle 2 similarly extends inwards, but slightly upwards,
to attach to the scutum. These two muscles clearly pull in the lateral prosomal walls
directly.

Muscle 3 is the lateral constituent of the ventral longitudinal series. It runs the whole
length of the trunk to attach to the body wall on either side of the anus. Its points of
attachment anteriorly—the prosomal tendinous sheet—are clearly much wider apart than
the hinder attachments. The muscles thus slope inwards as they pass backwards, and hence
must exert an oblique inwards pull on the prosomal walls.

Muscle 4 also slopes inwards as it passes upwards to attach to the antero-lateral corner
of the oral cone.
