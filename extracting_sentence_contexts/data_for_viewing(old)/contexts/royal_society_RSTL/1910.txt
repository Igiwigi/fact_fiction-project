the positive electricity passing into the turmeric paper at the point p, and out at
the extremity n. After forty or fifty turns of the machine, the extremity = was
examined, and the two points or angles found deeply coloured by the presence
of free alkali (fig. 2.).

463. A similar piece of litmus paper, dipped in solution of sulphate of soda
n, fig. 3, was now supported upon the end of the discharging train a, and its
extremity brought opposite a point p, connected with the conductor of the ma-
chine. After working the machine for a short time, acid was deyeloped at both
the corners towards the point, i. e. at both the corners receiving the electricities
from the air. Every precaution was taken to prevent this acid from being
formed by sparks or brushes passing through the air (322.) ; and these, with
the accompanying general facts, are sufficient to show that the acid was really
the result of electro-chemical decomposition (466.).

464. Then a long piece of turmeric paper, large at one end and pointed at the
other, was moistened in the saline solution, and immediately connected with
the conductor of the machine, so that its pointed extremity was opposite a
point upon the discharging train. When the machine was worked, alkali was

eyolyed at that point; and eyen when the discharging train was removed, and
the electricity left to be diffused and carried off altogether by the air, till al-
kali was evolved where the electricity left the turmeric paper.

465. Arrangements were then made in which no metallic communication
