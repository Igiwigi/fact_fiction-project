But the real weak point of Saus8URE's theory,
.5 though partly true, is its inability to account for many facts observed since his time.
5 The theory of CHarPENTIER, though not always fairly represented, has been shown to be
Z untenable. S The facts submitted to our consideration are briefly as follows :—We see the glacier
2 winding through a valley, squeezing itself through a gorge, and widening where it has
S room. We xee that the centre moves more quickly than the sides, and the top more
S quickly than the bottom ; and the next demand of the mind is for a general principle
Z which shall unite these facts, and from which they shall follow as physical corollaries. E Professor FokBgs seeks this principle in the viscosity of the ice. Ice, according to him,
£ is a substance resembling treacle, honey, or tar, and the observed phenomena are a conse-
= quence of this property.
