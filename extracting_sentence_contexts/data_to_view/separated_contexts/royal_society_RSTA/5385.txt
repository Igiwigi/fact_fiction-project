Brpwet1 found a phenomenon of this kind in iron, but it does not seem possible
that the above supposititious case is capable of explaining it, though of course the
true explanation may be in some respects of a similar nature. But the circumstance
are not the same as those supposed. The assumption of a definite connexion between:
H and B, and elastic storage of the energy T, is very inadequate to represent the fact
of magnetisation of iron, save within a small range. Magneticians usually plot the curve connecting H — hy and B, not between Hand B
or which would be the same, between H — h, and B — B,, where B, is the intrinsie
magnetisation. Now when an iron ring is subjected to a given gaussage (or magneto
motive force), going through a sequence of values, there is no definite curve connecting
H — h, and B, on account of the intrinsic magnetisation.
