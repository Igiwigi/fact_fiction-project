A possible explanation Colour patterns of PGHs affect temperature regulation.
as to why the colour morphs are not influenced by plasticity During sun basking, darker morphs warm up faster and
is that PGHs often use unstable habitats characterized by attain higher equilibrium body temperatures compared
unpredictable environmental change. with paler morphs [71,72]. Such differences in thermal

capacity can potentially influence lifetime reproductive suc-
cess, because body temperature affects all aspects of
organismal performance, ranging from physiology and loco-
motion to behaviour and life-history [49,61,73-75]. The
evolutionary consequences of this are, however, complicated
by the fact that preferred temperatures differ between males
and females [76,77], as outlined in §4. Selection imposed by predators and thermal conditions
likely play key roles as drivers of clines, mosaics and
dynamics of colour polymorphism in PGHs [41,63,64,72,76]. However, evolution of spatial differences and temporal
shifts in morph frequencies can also be influenced by indirect
responses to selection on traits that are developmentally,
genetically and phenotypically associated with colour pattern
[55,78,79], and by sex-specific differences in behaviour, physi-
ology, body size and morphology (electronic supplementary
material, table S1; figure 3).

(iii) Functional importance and selective drivers
There are many ways by which colour pattern can contribute
to variation in performance and fitness among individuals,
and thereby impact the spatio-temporal dynamics of colour
polymorphisms [55].
