The true medulla is the cellular
element, All my subsequent rescarches have tended to confirm these yiews. I neyer doubted for a moment
that these axial yessels represented the yascular bundles of living Lycopods.


OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES. 299

Tf I have correctly interpreted the facts just described, and I believe I have done
$0, the life-history of this plant throws an important light upon many of those described
in the last, or second, of this series of memoirs. How far the numerous plants there
referred to may prove to be different states of a few species is not easy to determine,
because we do not obtain them in that condition of stratigraphical isolation which has
afforded such an important help in the case of the Burntisland examples. In that memoir
I pointed out how closely some of the Lepidodendroid forms resembled Corpa's Diplozylon,
and how the absorption of the cellular medulla of some of them would actually convert
them into examples of the latter genus.
