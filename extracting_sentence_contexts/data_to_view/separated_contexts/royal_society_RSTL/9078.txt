Now in such a substance as water, a difference
of 60* means that the flow is three times as great at the high as at the low tempera-
ture, 80 that gome of the alcohols which by GutrovuT's method seemed to offer the
greatest retardabion, may really, if compared under just conditions, have the least
friction. As regards liquids, it would appear from the researches of Koee that in
order to obtain chemical deductions from their physical examination they musb be
examined when their vapour tensions are equal, as then they exist under somewhat
comparable conditions as to mobility and expansion. GuEROUT has also in the second
of these papers determined the effect of variation of temperature on the rate of flow,
and comes to the conelusion that the rate for water varies by a constant factor
whose value is 1025, The experiments were, however, done within a very narrow
range, viz. : 10* to 17%; and GurRour seems to have been ignorant of the fact that
his countryman, PoisEIULLB, carefully determined this some forty years earlier, and
