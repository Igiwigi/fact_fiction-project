The mean increase in molecular viscosity work for the change of «a monobromit
into a dibromide is 174: the increase, however, tends tu become greater the highet
the molecular weight. As in the case of molecular viscosity the effect of substituting H by Cl in a ch og
methane is smaller the larger the amount of chlorine in the molecule. WEEN THE VISCOSITY OF LIQUIDS AND THEIR CHEMICAL NATURE. 657

Aa in the case of molecular viscosity, the different values given by the comparisons
bo partly due to the fact that the addition of « carbon atom to form the group
:@ exerts a different effect from that produced when the carbon atom udded
3 the group C:O, and partly to the presence of molecular aggregates in the
thy] alcohol. E TSoMERS.
