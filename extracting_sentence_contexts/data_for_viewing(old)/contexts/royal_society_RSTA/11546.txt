+ The statement is also true for the soft y rays from radium. With hard y rays a “density law” holds
and A/p is constant for different elements.

EMISSION AND TRANSMISSION OF RONTGEN RAYS. 145

The fact is clear from the table that for the same radiator \/p is relatively low
when screen and radiator are alike. With a radiator of copper (or any member of the
Cr-Zn group) the effect is very marked, and Benorst’s transparency curve would in
this case be modified by the addition of a sharp maximum in the neighbourhood of
the atomic weight of the radiator. Barkia and SapLER* have obtained a similar
result in the case of secondary Réntgen rays. With an aluminium anticathode and
the potential used the transparency curve would be not very far from a straight line.

Fhe Initial Steepening of the Logarithmic Curves.—The early steeper portion of each
q logarithmic curve of transmission when radiator and screen are alike has been noticed
o(figs. 7,8,and 9). The extent of the steepening depends on the material of the screen.
P An explanation which suggests itself is that the effect is due to the presence,
‘gin the radiation, of a certain amount of soft rays. If this were the cause, however, we
