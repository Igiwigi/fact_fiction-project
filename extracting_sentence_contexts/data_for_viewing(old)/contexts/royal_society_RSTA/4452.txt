contamination.

A total of 49 bacterial phylotypes were discovered by sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes.
Of them, only two phylotypes have successfully passed all contamination criteria, including
our own contaminant library [23] consisting of 278 phylotypes (as of June 2014) originating
from various contamination sources (e.g. negative PCR, sham DNA extraction, human-associated
bacteria, drilling fluid, even dust microparticles in clean-room facilities). With no such library the
work on tiny cell biomass is meaningless.


The first remaining phylotype, hereafter w123-10, proved to be a hitherto-unknown type
of bacterium showing less than 86% sequence similarity to known taxa. Its phylogenetic
assignment to bacterial divisions was also unsuccessful except for the fact that it showed
reliable clustering with the above-mentioned unidentified bacterium AF532061 earlier detected
in accretion ice. The second phylotype is still dubious in terms of contamination. It showed 93%
similarity to Janthinobacterium sp. of Oxalobacteraceae (f-Proteobacteria)—well-known ‘water-
loving’ bacteria, though we do not expect to meet a known representative of Oxalobacteraceae
in Lake Vostok because of its hitherto known physical-chemical conditions. Notably, no Archaea
were detected in all tested samples of frozen lake water.

Regarding 47 contaminant phylotypes detected in drillbit and borehole-frozen lake water
samples, they proved to belong to several bacterial divisions Proteobacteria (33 phylotypes),
Actinobacteria (six phylotypes), Firmicutes (seven phylotypes) and Bacteroidetes (one phylotype)
with predominance of y-Proteobacteria (19 phylotypes), which indicates that the main sources of : =
contamination were human-associated and soil bacteria. It means that, even working in clean- 3
