Whether, in fact, where the plants are thus growing in
association, there is a paralle] action to that which takes place when they are grown
in alternation ? This explanation obviously itself left unsolved the question of the 8ource of the
nitrogen of the Leguminosw, besides involving other difficulties. Still, ib seemed to
accord with other known facts, and to be at any rate the best that could be offered
in defect of more satisfactory or countervailing evidence. However, as already
referred to, after the experiments had been continued for 20 years, samples of the
8oils and su√æbsoils were taken, from each plot, at different depths, and determinations
of nitrogen have been made in them. The results show a considerably lower per-
centage in the first nine inches of depth of the mineral manured plob 7 than in that
of the unmanured plot 3; and 80 far as the calculation of such results into quantities
per acre can be relied upon, the difference is more than sufficient to account for the
increased yield of nitrogen over the 20 years in both the gramineous and the


EXPERIMENTS ON THE MIXED HERBAGE OF PERMANENT MEADOW.
