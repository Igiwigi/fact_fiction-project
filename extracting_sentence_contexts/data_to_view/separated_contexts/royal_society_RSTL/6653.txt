Eminence A, and of others, in reference to the moon's centre ; and taking into account the
probable interval between the two drawings, namely two minutes, the amount of angular
gmotion of A is a very near approximation to the angular change which must actually
Ehave occurred. As mentioned above, there is in the drawings an exaggeration of the
Edimensions of the prominences, which renders them unfit for the precise determination
ZSof the moon's actual progression in the line of motion during the period of totality ;
Enovertheless they afford excellent evidence that there was, in fact, a covering and an
Auncoyering of prominences, which, taken in connexion with the change in the position-
angle of the protuberance A with reference to the moon's centre, can only be explained
on the asumption that these extraordinary appendages belong to the sun, and not to the
moon. Furthermore, it would be quite possible to make out, with considerable although not
with absolute accuracy, from these drawings, the direction of the moon's motion, and the
extent to which the prominences first seen were obscured by the progress of the lunar
disk, and others uncovered on the opposite side as the moon. continued her course. For
instance, it will be remarked on inspection, that the streak of prominences, almost 1' in
