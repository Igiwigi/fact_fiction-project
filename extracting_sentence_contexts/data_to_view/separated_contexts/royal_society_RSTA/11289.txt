8 ‘The agreement is certainly closer than I anticipated from the use of any formula
& with only two arbitrary constants. Of course I was led to try — °369 in the index
‘© of (9) from having already found + °369 in the index of (8); but this does not affect:
§ the significance of the fact that formule with the same numerical index should so
p> closely reproduce the depression and recovery phenomena.

& The expectation that (9) would apply to all aneroids treated as the 4 were, could,
2 of course, only be justified by very wide experiment. As will be shown later, the law

“5 of recovery certainly depends on the rate and type of the pressure changes.

a3) Effects of Temperature.

> § 22. Aneroids are usually “corrected for temperature,” #.¢., there is a compensating
& arrangement to prevent the reading altering when the instrument is exposed to
& varying temperature at ordinary atmospheric pressure.
