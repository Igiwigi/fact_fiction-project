The same indetermination of judgement which causes a drawing to be perceived
by the mind at different times as two different figures, frequently gives rise to a false
perception when objects in relief are regarded with a single eye. The apparent con-
version of a cameo into an intaglio, and of an intaglio into a cameo, is a well-known
instance of this fallacy in vision; but the fact does not appear to me to have been
correctly explained, nor the conditions under which it occurs to haye been properly
stated.

This curious illasion, which has been the subject of much attention, was first ob-
seryed at one of the early meetings of the Royal Society*. Several of the members
looking through a compound microscope of a new construction at a guinea, some of
them imagined the image to be depressed, while others thought it to be embossed,
as it really was. Professor GMs, of Wurtemburg, published a paper on the same
subject in the Philosophical Transactions for 1745 ; his experiments were made with
telescopes and compound microscopes which inverted the images; and he observed
that the conversion of relief appeared in some cases and not in others, at some times
and not at others, and to some eyes also and not to others. He endeavoured to
