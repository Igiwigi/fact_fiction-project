He has, however, given names to each separate muscle (1890,
plate 5, figure 1), names such as adductor capitis and levator capitis which suggest that the
separate muscles function in different ways. This is certainly not the case. From their
common point of origin on the rigid skeletal plates and the fact that they all end on the
soft flexible outer wall of the blood pump they can only function in one way, as simple
compressors, pulling in this wall. Inside the wall is a thick lining of very delicate, large-celled parenchymatous tissue
which is continuous anteriorly with the parenchyma surrounding and permeating the
adductor scutorum, This tissue does not fill the blood pump, but leaves a median space free
and it is this space that is continuous with the dorsal prosomal blood space that I have just
described. In addition, however, as can be seen from figures 4 and 12, it is continuous
through the rostral valve with the peduncular vessel.
