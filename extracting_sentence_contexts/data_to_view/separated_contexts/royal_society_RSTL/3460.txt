There are cases in abundance of electric currents produced by pure chemical
action, but not one undoubted instance of the production of a current by pure con-
tact. As I conceive the great question must now be settled by the weight of evi-
dence, rather than by simple philosophic conclusions (1799.), I purpose adding a few


ACTIVE VOLTAIC ARRANGEMENTS WITHOUT METALLIC CONTACT. 115

observations and facts to show the number of these cases, and their force. In the
Eighth Series of these Researches* (April, 1834,) I gave the first experiment, that I
am aware of, in which chemical action was made to produce an electric current and
chemical decomposition at a distance, in a simple circuit, without any contact of
metals (880, &c.). It was further shown, that when a pair of zinc and platinum
plates were excited at one end by dilute nitro-sulphuric acid (880.), or solution of
potash (884.), or eyen in some cases a solution of common salt (885.), decomposi-
tions might be produced at the other end, of solutions of iodide of potassium (900.)
