as the code size can be adaptively changed without disrupting existing connections.

(i) System performance for an ideal channel

It is informative to examine the ideal channel case to understand the system limitations when the
transmission bandwidth is larger than needed for the symbol rate used. The decoded vector in
this case can be rewritten as

rp ~ e
v= witht Naip, (2.7)
where r represents the clipping coefficient that describes the power loss due to clipping. Using the

fact that x can be modelled as approximately Gaussian, the clipping coefficient, r, can be calculated
from the Bussgang theorem [21] using

The effective noise vectors after the IFWHT operation are denoted as n= (n/N)(H}, - Ay)
