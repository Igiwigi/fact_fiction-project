5. Timing as a sexually selected trait in
mammals

Whether sexual selection exists among mammals on timing
during the breeding season, either on daily or annual pro-
cesses, is presently unclear. This, we propose, is at least in
part due to the very few studies of biological timing and con-
sequences for reproductive success in free-living mammals
that are detailed enough to address this question (and the
few existing ones were conducted primarily on squirrels
(Sciuridae [116-120]). This may arise from the fact that field
studies of daily and annual patterns of behaviour are logisti-
cally challenging, especially when a fine resolution of daily or
seasonal patterns of individuals of both sexes along with esti-
mates of individual reproductive success is required (though
research on ecology and natural selection has clearly been
done (e.g. [134-142])). Some of these hurdles can be over-
come by employing small biologging devices which today
allow collection of long-term and precise biological data
from even quite small free-living mammals [143,144]. In
addition, there are the associated difficulties in determining
paternity of these same animals. Although there are pub-
lished studies of paternity in free-living mammals (e.g.
