Whatever the arrangement of the crystals in any particular sample of a substance,
if that sample is tested at different temperatures, the results express the variation
with temperature of the thermal conductivity of that sample in some fixed direction,
and enable the question as to whether conductivity increases or decreases with
increase of temperature to be answered. The curves expressing the results of the experiments show that there is a marked
increase of the thermal conductivities of ice, naphthaline, aniline, and nitrophenol as
the temperature is decreased, a slight increase (in terms of the hydrogen scale only)
in the cases of 8 naphthol and diphenylamine, and possibly of paraffin wax, and an
increase to a maximum at —80° with a decrease beyond in the case of glycerine. These facts point to the conclusion that the effect of temperature on the thermal
conductivities of electrical insulators is mainly, if not entirely, determined by the
physical and chemical nature of each substance, and cannot be stated for electrical
insulators generally, although there seems on the average to be a tendency towards
higher conductivities at lower temperatures. In two cases, 7.¢., those of ice and aniline, the thermal conductivity of the solid is
much greater than that of the liquid; while in another, glycerine, the conductivities”
in the two states near the melting-point are almost identical.
