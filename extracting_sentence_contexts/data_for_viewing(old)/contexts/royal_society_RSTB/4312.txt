These variations cannot, however, be considered more than might be expected.

Some more important features remain to be noted. In the first group ofâ€™ years,
and in the last group, the amplitudes of the 97-week and of the 114-week periods
are large and nearly equal. No evidence of any kind has been found to suggest that
there is anything but complete independence between these periods. If this
independence is a reality, it follows that two epidemics of different periodicities have
been running in London together for the last 75 years, though for a considerable
period one of them has been more or less in abeyance. If this intermixture of
epidemics is admitted it increases the likelihood that the cause of an epidemic is
associated in some way with the variation in the power of infectivity on the part of
an organism. When this infectivity rises, other things being equal, an epidemic is
the result. The facts thus suggest the existence of two different strains of the
measles organism having somewhat different peculiarities in their life-histories.

It is difficult to see how regular double periods can be explained on the hypothesis
of constant infectivity. In the interest of this assumption it might be predicated
that the different periods are the result of difference of class conditions which
distinguish the different districts of London. But in this connection it must be
remembered that it is only in poorer districts that measles, as a rule, is associated
with a high mortality, and that consequently the statistics must largely refer to such
