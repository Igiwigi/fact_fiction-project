} Lawson describes his prothalli as belonging to 7’m. tannensis, but he apparently employs this name as
a general designation and not as referring to any particular form. In the absence of data as to sporophytic
characters, it is impossible to say which particular form is meant.

The form whose prothallus was discovered by Hottoway was identified by this author as 7Z'm. lanceolata ;
but the sporophyte shown in his photograph (Plate I, facing p. 3) does not agree with Dancxarp’s original
description and figure of this form (Danerarp, 1890-91, p. 204, fig. 6, Plate XV). It appears to correspond
rather to the 7'm. elongata of Dancrarp (loc. cit., p. 186, fig. 5, Plate XII; compare Plate 5, figs. 5 and 10
in the present paper). The discrepancy arises from the fact that DaNGEARD’S paper was not accessible to
Ho.toway.
