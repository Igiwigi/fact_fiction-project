Note that although the optimized structures predicted from the CAS(8,12)/AVTZ
calculations are in excellent agreement with those obtained at the FVCAS/AVTZ level, the
inclusion of all valence space in the ndc treatment reduces the energy difference between
LC? Xe )and 1-C4PByg) by about 115.4 kJ mol~!. In fact, at the ve-CASDC/CBS level, these latter
forms are separated by 145.6 kJ mol~!. Note that the energy splitting between the 5Bog and TAs
rhombic structures is predicted to be 136.5 kJ mol! at this level. Such a result is in reasonable
agreement with the corresponding vertical excitation energy of 187.2k} mol‚Äù! reported by Mass6
et al. [38] at the ve-MRCI(Q)/VTZ level.
