powder like palladium black is not at all easy, to adopt, for comparative purposes,
the value 12째0 as the density of palladium in its three states of aggregation, viz.,
black, sponge, and foil. As the actual measurements are always given in addition,
this assumption ought not to give rise to any error, and is to a certain extent justified
by the fact that, under proper conditions, the number of volumes of hydrogen

occluded by unit volume of the different varieties of palladium remains practically
the same,

IV. Analysis of Palladium Black.

Before beginning any extended experiments with palladium black a preliminary
examination was made. From the fact that platinum black prepared in the same

way invariably contains oxygen, it was thought that palladium black would also
contain oxygen. On igniting 1째5650 gram palladium black in a hard glass tube in
vacuo, however, only 0째33 cub. centim. oxygen and 0째56 cub. centim. carbon dioxide
were extracted. This proves that the oxygen, if any be present, is more firmly
retained by palladium than by platinum.

Another portion of palladium black, weighing 1:9795 gram, was placed in a hard
