It was annealed in hot sand, and its resistance at 14* C. is about 905 ohms. No. 21 is a piece of the same wire, made of the same stick, and annealed with No. 20. That it did not take the annealing 0 effectually is clear from the fact that its resistance
at 14* C. is about 120,000 ohms. No. 22 was made up at the same time and in the same way as Nos. 20 & 21.
