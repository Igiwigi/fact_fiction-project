AIAS. ME offers a systematic way to certify a graduate by defining the body of
knowledge required for designing and validating, as part of the curriculum, the formative
and summative assessment of a graduateâ€™s ability to use this body of knowledge.
Informed by the concept of responsible innovation, this contributes to ethical governance
processes [38]. While we cannot guarantee that engineering graduates will be good
citizens and/or will not make any fatal mistakes while carrying out their duties, we can
at least ensure that the graduates have achieved graduate-skills at a suitable standard. In
the same manner that human learning continues on the job, through training, monitoring,
and feedback; humans specialized in ME can certify an AIAS according to a standard of
performance and competency.

P7 Enables the deployment of context independent systems Transfer learning [39] is successful
on limited problems; possibly due to the fact that the AI was trained rather than educated.
ME offers the possibility that by structuring the body of knowledge for the AI, and
teaching an AI this body of knowledge through direct injection of knowledge and/or
data-driven ML, the AI is able to bootstrap [40] from its existing knowledge as it moves
to novel contexts that it has not encountered before. This characteristic stems from the
epistemological difference between training and education, where the latter empowers a
cognitive agent with the common body of knowledge required to develop competencies
on a variety of problem classes. Education allows agents to generalize on a body of
knowledge, providing them with cognitive elasticity to transform their knowledge from
one problem domain to another. Symbiomemesis demands these skills from AIAS as they
are core skills in humans.

P8 Supports the move away from narrowly skilled machines towards multi-skilled machines.
