The display of colours in the plumage of the birds of tropical climates is
also in strict accordance with the observed facts of the influence of colour over
the absorption and radiation of heat. The metallic reflexions and polished
surface of the whole family of humming-birds is admirably suited to their
habits ; and the colours of the wings of the Lepidoptera, in the class of insects,
there is little doubt, serve some similar purpose, in maintaining the tempera-
ture of the animals at the proper mean. In proportion to the diminution of
temperature and the distance from the equator, a corresponding dilution of
colour in animals takes place, till in temperate countries it is almost uniformly
of a sober gray. In the arctic regions all colour except white and black disap-
pears,—modifications of which, with very little variety of other colours, form
the summer and winter clothing of most of the northern tribes of birds.

In the vegetable kingdom, I am disposed to believe that the colours of the
