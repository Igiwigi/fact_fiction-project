This experi-
ment also I sevyeral times repeated. By counting the globules given off, and comparing a certain number of them with
the average volume of steam in the last two experiments, an attempt was made to
ascertain what proportion of water could he decomposed by an ignited platinum wire
in aqueous vapour, or, which amounts to a corollary from this proposition, what degree
of dilution would enable mixed gas to exist without combustion in an atmosphere of
steam exposed to an ignited platinum wire. The proportion in an experiment in
which the globules were so counted, was 1 to 2400; the probability is however that

* I need scarcely point out the distinction, in fact, between this experiment and those in which liquid water
has been decomposed by the electric spark. See Supplemental Paper, p. 21. MR.
