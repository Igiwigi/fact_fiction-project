ways z can be composed of numbers none greater and not all less than y. The ana-

logy of this problem with that here treated is obvious, the function u,,, being in effect
identical with that which in the above notation would be expressed by II(#), y corre-
sponding to ours. Accordingly, as faras y=4, to which limit only the inquiry is there
extended, the results are identical (the mode of expression excepted) with those of our
equations (49.), (50.), (51.)4. The method there pursued (by the successive integra-
tion of equations of differences) would of course continue to afford similar results, but
without some systematic processes of notation, transformation and reduction, such as
those delivered in the foregoing pages, would speedily become too complicated to be
followed out, though the sort of form which would ultimately be assumed by the result
seems to have been clearly apprehended. Observing that in the cases of y=2, 3, 4,
the results express in fact the nearest integers to certain rational fractions, such as
- in the case of y=3, EIS (z even) and aa (z odd) when y=4, it is sug-
gested that © probably this simple species of description might be continued.” This,
on examination of the value above given, when y or $=5, appears to be the case, but
for higher values it will be necessary to enlarge the terms of the description, 50 as
to take in circulating functions of higher orders, and with more complicated coeffi-
cients. 'To make this apparent, suppose s=6. Then, without going into the whole
calculation (which however would not be materially more complicated than for $=5,
and would lead, as in that case, to a final period of 60, only not reducible to the sum

* It bears no name, but I have reason to believe it to be the production of Professor Dy Morgan.
+ Mr. WarnpurToy has also obtained expressions for the number of partitions as far as 4, and his results,
mulatis mutandis, agree with the above.
