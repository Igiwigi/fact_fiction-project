Broad agreement between the contribution of regenerated nutrients to the total upper ocean
nutrient pool derived from regenerated phosphate and nitrate isotope signatures suggests that
up to one-third of the phosphate and nitrate in the WAP surface ocean is regenerated locally,
rather than being supplied from CDW. This has implications for our understanding of new
production versus regenerated production if up to one-third of the nitrate and phosphate pools
are themselves regenerated, and could lower our estimates of net biological carbon uptake
based on nutrient uptake by the same proportion. The fact that the regenerated phosphate
contribution is significantly higher at the inner-shelf stations (TO07-T10) than mid- and outer-
shelf stations (TO1-T06) (p =3.75 x toâ€œ, two-sample t-test) further supports the argument that
biological nutrient regeneration can explain the progressive enrichment in subsurface nutrient
concentrations across the shelf.

(f) Macronutrient and inorganic carbon enrichment across the shelf

We have used nutrient and organic matter concentrations and nitrate and PN isotopes to
show that remineralization of organic matter sinking out of the surface ocean and subsequent
nitrification in the subsurface, where light levels are sufficiently low, can explain the observed
increase in nitrate concentration below the surface layer across the WAP shelf. Similar enrichment
in phosphate across the shelf and the strong positive linear correlation between [NO3~] and
[PO43-] (7? =0.983, p<22x 10-16, figure 7a) suggest that organic matter remineralization is also
the primary driver of cross-shelf enrichments in phosphate. This is supported further by broad
agreement between estimations of local biological nutrient regeneration based on regenerated
phosphate and nitrate isotopes.
