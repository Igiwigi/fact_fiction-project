fathers begins with 20 years with a maximum, and—after a dip at 22 years—returns to the climax of
fertility at 25-26 years ; further on, the natality declines somewhat equally towards the null-point at the
limit of the procreative period, The female monogenous table shows, with a rapid rise, its maximum
between 19 and 21 years, and falls then slowly but constantly to the period of sterility.

The two maxima of the male table can be simply explained by the two causes of fertility, the age of
the parents and the duration of marriage. The second maximum may probably be attributed to the
climax of male procreative power, the first maximum to the duration of marriage; the 20 year-old
husbands having been all married but one or two years only, and these recent marriages being nearly all
fertile ones, we meet at this place of the table a maximal yalue which could not be explained only by
the age and by the generative power depending on it.

The female table shows only one maximum, in accordance with the fact that the age of marriage
nearly coincides with that of greatest generative power.

The influence of these two factors (age of parents and duration of marriage) on the frequency of
births cannot be other than a continuous one, and this for the following reasons :—

(a) One could not suppose d priori that the changes produced by one of the causes, taken by itself,
could produce a discontinuity in the frequency of births, since all phenomena of human masses hitherto
observed change continuously with their causes.

(6) But if none of the causes taken separately produces a discontinuous effect on a table depending
exclusively on this one factor, it is evident that a table based on the effect of both factors and arranged
according to the progress of age, will also show no point of discontinuity. With the age of the
