In this study, When comparing svb promoter and DSCP, it is clear that
we found that Drosophila promoters have different mutational the endogenous svb promoter had low activity (figure 1),
profiles from enhancers. At a comparable mutation rate to the consistent with previous views [19]. The fact that both subp
previously published E3N enhancer library [17], variants in and DSCP had access to mutations that can increase the
our promoter libraries did not show any changes in the pattern expression level (figures 2 and 3) suggested that the low
of gene expression (figures 2 and 3, electronic supplementary activity of endogenous promoters might be a result of selec-
material, figure S5). By contrast, almost all mutant lines of tion. Furthermore, the high-activity, artificially engineered
E3N changed the pattern (figure 2, electronic supplementary promoter was more ‘evolvable’ (or ‘breakable’) in the sense
material, figure S3).
