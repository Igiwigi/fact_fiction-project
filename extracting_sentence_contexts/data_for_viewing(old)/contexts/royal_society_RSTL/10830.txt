Is the year 1833 Fertx SAvVART published a remarkable memoir* on the structure
of liquid jets from circular orifices, in which he demonstrated the following facts :—

A vertical jet of liquid from a circular orifice presents in general two distineb
portions—an upper continuous or rod-like portion, and a lower or troubled portion ;
the relative lengths of these two regions being approximately the same in air as
in a vacuum.

The lower or troubled portion consists of separate drops, as proved by the fact that
objects may be viewed through it, even when the jet is composed of an opaque
liquid like mercury.

The troubled portion of a jet which is not perfectly insulated from accidental
vibrations, or from the vibrations produced by its impact against a solid body, pre-
