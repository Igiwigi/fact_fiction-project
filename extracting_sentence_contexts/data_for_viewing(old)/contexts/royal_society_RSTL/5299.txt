60 MR. T. H. HUXLEY ON THE: MORPHOLOGY: OF THE CEPHALOUS MOLILUSCA;

the portion of the molluscous type here considered*, and indeed to; be peculiar'to it.
Its occurrence in Chiton, therefore, would effectually determine the molluscous
nature of that genus, even if there were: no other grounds for the conclusion ; while
the structure, of the buccal armature of Sagitta, which has been compared to the
protruded tongue of a Heteropod, is. in fact s0 totally different as at once to remove
it from the MolluscaÞ.

I may further remark, that the structure/of the. tongue in'the Cephalopoda adds
one more link. to, the very strong' chain of affinity. between them \and-the- ordinary
Mollusca.

Of the Pyloric Sac. —This appears in,various forms in a great number of the Mol
lusca, and seems to. be, always in special relation with the liver. In 4tanta, it has
been seen that its glandular parietes form the liver... In the Cephalopoda the hepatic
ducts enter its representative, the spiral sac of Octopoda, the elongated sac- of Loligo.
The extreme length of the pyloric sac' in Cleodora, and the occurrence-of arsecond
smaller one, appear: to, be leading the way to the ramified prolongations of the
