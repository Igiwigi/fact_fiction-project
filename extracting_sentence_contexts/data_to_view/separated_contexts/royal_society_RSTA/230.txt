Similarly, microscopic models that describe

he behaviour of individual drivers (Lagrangian description) may be fitted to
microscopic data, and the corresponding driver parameters can be determined. It is also possible to fit microscopic models to macroscopic data and vice versa,
out this is less straightforward. Data-fitting for traffic systems is far from trivial,
caused partly by the possibly large number of model parameters and partly by the
fact that the studied high degree-of-freedom system changes in time; it is not that
easy to fit an elephant in motion (see the quote at the beginning of this paper). In Wagner (2010), macroscopic data are used to estimate model parameters
for both macroscopic and microscopic models, while, in Hoogendoorn &
Hoogendoorn (2010), microscopic models are fitted to microscopic data. In
Laval & Leclercq (2010), microscopic data are used to build microscopic models,
and it has been proved essential to add dynamics to kinematic models to be able
o reproduce traffic jam formation as observed in data.
