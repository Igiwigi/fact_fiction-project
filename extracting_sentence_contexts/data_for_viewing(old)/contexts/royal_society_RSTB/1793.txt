influence of a physiological law. }

Undertaking (on the base of M, Kragr’s Table 25, ‘ Anniversaire,’ p, 112) this
calculation for Norway, by the same method as for Budapest, I found

in the average. Thus the probability is against the supposition of a physiological law,
and the fact that at Budapest the males reach the same natality five years later than
females may be regarded only as a mechanical effect of the social causes which rule
the age combinations of the marrying couples.

7. Difference between the Actual and the Physiological Natality.

As mentioned before, the legitim&te natality is to be regarded as the resultant of
two distinct forees: the physiological and the moral moment. To ascertain the
isolated effect of the physiological factor, we ought to look for such cases where the
moral check is nought, or the least possible. No doubt that this check is the
strongest where the number of children is greatest, and the weakest where there are
no children at all. Thus, we might suppose that it is with the new married couples
that the effect of the moral restraint is nearly nought, and where, therefore, the force
