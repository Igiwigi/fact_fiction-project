of AA the character on day » — 3 falls below, while that on day n + 8 is still much
above the normal; also the character figures for days m -+ 1 and » + 2 respectively
notably exceed those for days n —1 and n —2. There is thus a marked skewness in
AA. Skewness in the same direction, but gradually diminishing, is also seen in curves
BB, CC and DD. But in DD it is very slight, and in EE it has changed its type, the
character figures for the days subsequent to the crest being now a shade less than those
for the corresponding days preceding it. The fact that, in these five cases, the last three
of the character figures for days n + 3 and all the character figures for days n — 8 fall
below the normal is not really strange. We have collected in column » the outstanding
disturbed days of the month, and this tends to reduce below the normal the character
figures in all the other columns. ‘The mean character figures for days n — 1, n + 1 and
n -- 2 exceed the normal only because of the tendency for disturbed and quiet days to
occur in groups. ‘This fact has to be remembered, even in connection with the secondary
pulse. A selected D day has only 4 chances as against the 5 for the non-selected days of
contributing to the secondary pulse in its own month, and its chance of contributing is
further reduced when the selected D days occur in groups. But even in a 31-day month
only the first four days have the 27th subsequent day in the same month. Except ina
wholly exceptional case the great majority of the days contributing to the secondary
(subsequent) pulse belong to the following month, and the direct influence on the
secondary pulse of the choice of days made for the primary pulse is insignificant.

In short, unless a real tendency to recurrence after a 27-day interval existed, the
secondary pulse, apart from accident, would be only of the most insignificant amplitude,
and opposite in sign to the primary pulse. The difference in the amplitudes of the
