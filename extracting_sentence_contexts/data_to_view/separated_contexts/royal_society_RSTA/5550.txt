However, the weak boundary
condition (1.5) involves the quantity 3;p, which might not be well defined on 4 in this case. Therefore, we propose an even weaker formulation than (1.5) for the boundary condition, which
involves the quantity

di(p + (u- Vrd(e,32))), on a2,

instead. This is motivated by the fact that for u is smooth enough (say in C°“(2) with a > 1/2)
with wu - i =0 on the boundary, 32, one has:

~ 2
di(u - Vad(e, 32)) =0, onag. (1.7)

Consequently, instead of the weak boundary condition (1.5) for the pressure, we consider in this
study the following version:

- aa(p + (u- Vyd(x, 3@))’) =(u@u): Vai, ona. (1.8)

This is obviously equivalent to the boundary conditions (1.4) or (1.5) in the case of classical
solutions; in particular, it is equivalent to (1.5) when u € C°(2) with w > 1/2. However, when
a € (0, 1/2], which included the Onsager’s critical exponent a = 1/3, (1.8) is a weaker formulation
than (1.5) for the boundary condition of pressure in the framework of weak solution to the Euler
equations in the presence of a boundary. This is because the left-hand side of (1.8) involves the
sum of two terms, which we will show makes sense at the boundary, while each term might
not necessarily be regular enough to make sense at the boundary on its own.
