temperature, whilst the numbers given on p. 544 show that the temperature coefficient
of @ is of the same order of magnitude as the coeflicient of linear expansion of the
corresponding solid conductor.

These facts render it probable that ® is a function of the size and distance apart of
the molecules of which the conductor consists. If we consider ¢ in the formula
®=$¢/Cas the distance apart of the centres of the molecules in the solid state, it
will be proportional to the cube root of the atomic volume. We should therefore
expect the work done by a corpuscle in passing through the surface layer of different
metals to be approximately equal to a constant divided by the cube root of the
atomic volume. Up to the present © has been determined only for sodium, platinum
and carbon, but fortunately these three elements furnish a considerable range of
atomic volume. As a matter of fact, carbon has the smallest atomic volume of all
elements, whilst that of sodium is only exceeded by the alkali metals of greater
atomic weight.

In the accompanying table values of the atomic volume and the inverse of its cube
