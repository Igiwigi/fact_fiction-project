the labyrinth are essentially the same, for this opening perforates the cranial wall through
the loop of the posterior semicircular canal. Nielsen compares this aperture with Aldinger’s
canal and also considers them partly homologous. He finds Aldinger’s idea that the canal
was ‘? for an electric organ’ unlikely, but does suggest that it may have served for some

nerve or nerves connected with the unusually swollen medulla oblongata (Nielsen 1942,
p. 102). My specimen of Caturus, being more complete than C. groenlandicus, shows the
lateral cranial canal to have no external outlet at all, so that any nervous function seems
ruled out—a conclusion which is supported by the fact that in Boreosomus the homologous
opening is sometimes lacking. Moreover, Nielsen notes that there has hitherto been no
function satisfactorily ascribed to the fossa bridgei, and that in Acipenser and Polyodon (the
second of which has the communicating opening) it is filled with fatty tissue.

It would be interesting to know whether a lateral cranial canal was common among the
Holostei; but, apart from Dapedius, no fossil genera are known with the interior of the skull
so well preserved as Caturus and few are as well ossified. In Lepidotus latifrons, for instance,
only parts of the posterior semicircular canal were found to be surrounded by bone, and if
such a canal existed it would not be preserved in the fossil state. The same probably applies
to the Pachycormidae. Serial sections through the larval forms of Lepidosteus showed no
such structure in the cartilage of the otic region, nor does it exist in Amia, so far as can be
