degeneration of the fibres arising in the accessory ganglion of the opposite side
was well marked, and was traced in diminishing quantity from the corpus trapezoides
to the internal geniculate body. This proves conclusively the existence of a direct
strand of fibres between the accessory auditory ganglion and the opposite
internal geniculate body. Hence we are unable to confirm the statement of
Epincer (14) that this segment of the auditory path is interrupted, first, in the
superior olivary body and, secondly, in the nucleus of the lateral fillet. From the
fact that the auditory tract diminishes in extent as it is traced upwards, it may be
argued that many of its fibres terminate in the superior olivary bodies, the nucleus
of the lateral fillet, and the posterior quadrigeminal tubercles, but that a considerable
number pass to the internal geniculate body uninterrupted (vide Schema 2). No
degeneration was observed in the so-called peduncle of the superior olive, which
passes from this body to the nucleus of the sixth cranial nerve, a fact which indicates
that there is no direct connexion between the auditory nerve and the centre for
conjugate movement of the globes.

(d) Degenerations following Unilateral Destruction of the Posterior Quadrigeminal
Body and Lateral Fillet.

Consequent on this operation there was found a degenerated strand of fibres in the
external portion of the tegmentum cruris, mesial to the internal geniculate body, in
the position assigned to the continuation of the central auditory tract. In these
sections it was more clearly seen that many of the degenerated fibres turned into
the internal geniculate body, the ventral part of which showed a scattered degenera-
tion, and that others passed on directly into the ventral portions of the optic
