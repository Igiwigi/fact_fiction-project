But whether the appearances figured are sections of solid rods or of tubes remains
uncertain. The substance, if any, which lies inside the sharply-cut rings will not stain
with any stain which I have employed ; but this does not prove that there is nothing
there, and even under the highest powers there is no appearance of double contour in
the rings, which one might have expected to see were they tubes with a bounding wall.

One is tempted to compare them with the long fibrillar processes which run through
the developing enamel of Marsupials (8); but it must be remembered that these
have been shown to be prolongations of the plasm of the ameloblast cells, whereas no
such relation can be established in the case of these bodies seen in the Gadidse, as
they are not seen prior to the disappearance of these cells.

Two facts are perfectly clear: the first, that the enamel of these fishes is certainly
not an excretion from the end of the ameloblasts, for they have disappeared long
before calcification takes place; the other that the calcification does take place
in the form of a conversion of or a deposition in a pre-existent stroma of definite
arrangement.

My preparations of Sargus and of Labrus, though less perfect, amply suffice to prove
that in these fishes there is a bulky enamel stroma of similar character to that here
described ; in fact, that the process is in all essentials the same as in the Gadide,

And, as has already been mentioned, all these fish have enamels which possess a
character not met with in mammalian enamels, namely, a distinct striation which
starts inwards from the free surface, and is lost before it reaches the dentine surface,
