Further inland Romano-
British agriculture spread its fields along the silt banks of the river channels, but
behind these banks lay the waterlogged sedge fens, cut off from drainage to the rivers,
and quite unused by man. We have yet to learn the extent of the drainage works under-
taken in this period: there are many indications that they were extensive, and there is
some evidence that they were carried out during the last stages of the marine invasion
itself. It is a striking fact that the silts of this marine invasion reflect marine conditions
more strongly marked than those of the fen clay invasion, and it is clear that strong
tides must have flowed far up the fen rivers during their deposition. From this time onwards the fen strata yield less and less evidence of former conditions,
and we pass progressively into the territory of the geographical historian. We need only
recall that throughout the dark ages the fenlands remained virtually untenanted.
