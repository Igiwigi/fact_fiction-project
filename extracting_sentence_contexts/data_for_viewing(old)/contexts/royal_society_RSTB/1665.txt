Some of the anterior caudal vertebree (fig. 37) carry short ribs, which are attached
upon the neurocentral suture ; long before maturity they fuse with their vertebrae and
then look like transverse processes. CxiAus (Lit., No. 24) was the first who showed
the existence of such caudal ribs in. crocodiles and tortoises, and, as the same


VERTEBRAL COLUMN OF AMPHIBIA AND AMNIOTA. 39

vertebrae carry chevrons besides, he naturally concluded that ribs and chevrons are
not the same elements.

The atlas and the epistropheus are of supreme interest (figs. 34 and 37). Crocodiles
are, in fact, the only animals in which these vertebre retain all their constituent:
hard parts in an almost undisturbed primitive condition.

The basal piece of the atlas, the first basiventral or intercentrum, carries a long rib,
which is movably attached by its capitulum. This rib still retains in many specimens
a small knob or excrescence on its dorsal edge, which is the last remnant of the
tubercular portion. This tuberculum was still complete in mesozoic crocodiles, for
instance, in Metriorhynchus, in which it articulated upon a prominence which was
formed conjointly by the first and second centra.
