the muscle; that this propagation acts with a velocity which we cannot judge to be
less than that of light and heat and electricity in their different media ; that that
which modifies, augments, or destroys the complication of the physico-chemical

phenomena comprehended in the nutrition of the muscles, operates equally upon its
contractility under any stimulus affecting the nerves ; finally, that the phenomenon
of the contraction of a muscle ought to be understood, with the condition that what-
ever be the cause of this phenomenon, it acts in accordance with the physical law of

elastic bodies. The phenomenon of induced contraction would seem to be a first fact
of induction of that force which circulates in the nerves and which arouses muscular
contraction.

Admitting that we cannot give a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon of
induced contraction by recurring to electricity or any other known causes, as I think
I have abundantly proved, it appears to me that we cannot, confining ourselvyes to
a first fact, as is that of induced contraction, interpret it differently from what we
have done. The induced contraction is only a new phenomenon of nervous force, a
phenomenon of which we have given the principal laws in this memoir. It seems
to me therefore more just to call that henceforth muscular induction, which I have
hitherto called induced contraction. I shall conclude this memoir with some appli-
cations of muscular induction to physiology.
