108 Mr. Lax's Method of finding the Latitude of a Place,

dently of the second incremental area, which I have demon-
strated above can never be necessary, except when the zenith
distance at noon is very small. The error of three seconds arises
from a different cause, and might have been entirely excluded
with the assistance of the gd and 4th tables. We should, in
fact, deduce from these tables an approximation of 22'; and, if
we calculate the area gc with the lat. 54* g2/ o”, it will be

found equal to 34,762, and consequently —_ = 48”,62, which,

multiplied by 22, produces 17” 49,64, for the correction, and
the lat. is found = 34* 27” 49,64.
