4) is the total current through
M, and C = C,Ro/(Ro+Mz2) is the current through the heater. For the third series
the correction for heating by obturator, stirring, &c., is given for each experiment in
the column “ Obturator, &c.”

Looking“at the columns headed “ Difference from mean,” it will be seen that there
is an ascending degree of accuracy as between individual experiments in the three
series. This is due in the second series to the fact that the runs were longer than in
the first, and in the third to the additional fact that the correction for heating by
obturator, stirring, &¢., had been reduced to a much smaller amount. When
corrected to correspond with the exact period from 13° C. to 55° C. the result of the
first two series is to give the mean value of J for tap-water from 13° C. to 55° C. as
4177 and that of the third series 4179. Owing to the largeness of the correction for
heating by obturator, &c., in the first two series we do not bring the results into the
average, but take the exact corrected figure yielded by the third series as the basis
of our calculations, that is to say, for “ tap-water” the mean value of J for the
interval from 13° ©.
