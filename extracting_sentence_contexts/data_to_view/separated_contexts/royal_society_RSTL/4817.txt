This substance acts with
energy upon oxide of mercury, with which it forms a compound dissolving in boiling
alcohol and separating from it on cooling in the form of pearly scales of remarkable
brilliancy, which present the greatest resemblance to mercaptide of mercury. The
liquid obtained in the above-mentioned reaction boils at 90? C., and possesses a compo»
sition and an aggregate of properties which closely resemble those of the mercaptan of
the ethyl-series, being in fact the allylic mercaptan,
