time in various ways imperfect, and partly in the fact that the fall of the weight could
be readily heard through the air. This may have caused the observer to anticipate
the very mall vibration which was produced in the mercury. The circuit-closer was
caused sometimes by the rapid up and down movement of the earth to leap out of
contact immediately after haying closed the circuit; in such cases the chronograph did

not act until the cirenit became permanently closed. The result of this was evidently
to reduce the apparent time of transit and hence increase the velocity.

The second cause of error above indicated was rendered very likely by the fact that
the motion of the machinery in the works kept up a continual vibration in the ground.

An automatic circuit-breaker was next introduced into this arrangement and the
distance reduced to 200 feet. A correction for instrumental error was in this case
determined from observations ab 100 feet. With this arrangement a mean velocity of
transit equal to 563 feet per second was obtained.

The state of the ground was in this case affected to some extent by frost, the
temperature the previous night being 9* Fahr. below freezing.

The circuit-closer was next altered and three more determinations made, the mean
result of which gave 379 feet per second. In this case, however, the previously
