(45) The effect of chromatic aberration

The fact that a change in the diameter of pupil, when retinal illumination is kept constant,
has so small an effect, appears to dispose of the hypothesis previously suggested by the
author (1944a), namely, that chromatic aberration plays a part in arresting the loss of colour
in the case of a grating of yellow and blue lines. This may be explained as follows. It was
found by experiment that the brightest rays of the spectrum, namely, the yellow and green
rays, normally produce sharply focused images on the retina.
