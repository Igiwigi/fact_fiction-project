of the longer wave-lengths have of necessity to be made at sea, the altitude might be
expected to influence the path, but the data of Series 28, for the range 5-15 m., which
are quoted in the next section, are in favour of the opposite view.

The degree of accord obtainable in these submarine measurements may be illustrated
by examples from Series 55. In this the deck-house roof illuminations, 7, being taken
as 100, the photometer swinging just above the water gave at the beginning of the series
at 12.29 G.M.T., 77-6 per cent., and at the end, at 1.59, it gave 78. For 40 metres’ depth
the values at 1.19, 1.29 and 1.32 were respectively 0-47, 0-42 and 0-42 per cent., though
the air illuminations, V,, had varied from 115 thousand metre candles to 75-9 and 114-6
respectively ; at 15 m. the percentages were 10-3 and 9-2 at 12.57 and 1.36 respectively,
while at 5 m. the values were 31-9 and 37-4 at 12.37 and 1.52. The difference here is
due to the fact that at such a small depth the angular distribution of the light in air may
make an appreciable difference to the length of the mean path in water, and the sun
was, at 12.37, visible through clouds, but was perfectly clear at 1.52; moreover, during
this long period the ship had not remained in the same water.

Ratio of Total to Diffuse Vertical IMumination in Air.

In this connection it is of interest to consider the ratio of the total vertical illumination
to the diffuse vertical illumination in air. Such values, denoted by 8, have been shown
in the records of the series of submarine measurements, The operation of screening
the sun’s disc, and no more, is not easy in a small ship rolling heavily, so the tendency
