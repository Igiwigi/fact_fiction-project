The extent of the motion in each particular joint is un-
doubtedly small, but this is compensated by their number, and
the elasticity of the vertebre themselves. Fish in general have their vertebre formed with similar
concavities to those of the squalus maximus; these, when ex-
amined after \death, contain a solid jelly, but in 'the living
fish it is found in a fluid state. This fact was ascertained
in the skate, the smallness of the quantity of fluid in any one
Joint, and the readiness with which it coagulates after death,
prevented it from: being before observed : the fluid .in the

skate is found by Mr. W. Brave to have the same properties,
as far as the small quantity that can be collected admits of
examination, with that in the squalus maximus. Although this structure of the intervertebral joint appears
to be common to fish in general ; the form of the cavity is
not in all exactly the same; in the skate it is very similar
to that in the squali, but in the common eel, it is more ob-
long, the longitudinal diameter being about one third longer
than the transverse one.
