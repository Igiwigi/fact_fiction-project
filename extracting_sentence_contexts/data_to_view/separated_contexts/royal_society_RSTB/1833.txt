(4.) The occasional development in Danwa of cells outside the definite sporogenous
group as fertile cells (fig. 21), and conversely of cells of the sporogenous group as
sterile cells (figs. 22, 23), shows that the fertile tissue is not so strictly defined in this
genus as it is usually found to be in other ferns. Now it is possible to read these facts as consistent with either a view of progressive
coalescence of sporangia originally separate, or of a progressive septation of a less
completely septate sorus. If the former view be taken, then the sorus of Danaa,
which shows the features mentioned more commonly than other genera, would be
held to have been descended from a type with sori even more elongated than those of
the present day. But Danaea is the genus of Marattiacew which has the longest
sori known in the family.
