In the first place it explains why, in all ordinary cases, the evolved sub-
stances appear only at the poles; for the poles are the limiting surfaces of the
decomposing substance, and except at them, eyery particle finds other particles
having a contrary tendency with which it can combine.

536. Then it explains why, in numerous cases, the elements or evolved sub-
stances are not retained by the poles ; and this is no small difficulty in those
theories which refer the decomposing effect directly to the attractive power of
the poles. If a piece of platina have sufficient power given to it by any means
to attract a particle of hydrogen from the particle of oxygen with which it was
the instant before combined, there seems no sufficient reason, nor any fact, ex-
cept those to be explained, which show why it should not, according to ana-
logy with all ordinary attractive forces, as those of gravitation, the magnet,
cohesion, chemical affinity, &c., retain that particle which it had just before
taken from a distance and from previous combination. Yet it does not do 0,
but allows it to escape freely. Nor does this depend upon its assuming the
gaseous state, for acids and alkalies, &c., are left equally at liberty to diffuse
themselves through the fluid surrounding the pole, and show no particular ten-
dency to combine with or cleave to the latter.
