Kater's' experiments for determining the

obtained: when the knife edges are viewed as dark objects/on
a light ground ; and on the contrary, the same quantity to
be added. when they are seen as light objects on a dark
ground. From the few experiments I have made, this quantity ap-
pears to be the same, whatever may be the relative illumina-
tion of the object and its ground, 0 long as the difference of
character is preserved. On the cause of this extraordinary
fact I can hazard no conjecture, and it remains an interesting
subject for future investigation. Of the expansion of the pendulum. The composition of brass is so various, that probably no
two specimens possess precisely the same rate of expansion.
