Every sequence consisting only of t’s permutes X, and (X)per,,, =f*. These two infinite regular
languages describe exactly six cyclic permutations of Y and X, respectively, where the former
permutations are restrictions of the latter Cg = (X)per = (Y)per.!® In this case, the ‘weak control’

16We remark that, while the event sequences f and L1 t each generate the permutator group (Y)per, the subsemigroups of the
semigroup of the lac operon automaton that they generate contain different subgroups isomorphic to Cs. This can be seen
from the fact that elements of the former fix the state Op while the latter do not. Generally, as it is defined by restriction, the
permutator group may be realized by many different subgroups of the semigroup of the automaton, as is the case also for the
other examples in this paper (see also [31]). Here the monogenic semigroups (f) and (L1f) inside (X)per,.,, contain disjoint
subgroups, each isomorphic to Cs.


is rather ‘strong’, in that every permutator element of the lower set Y is realized as the restriction
of a permutator element of the larger natural system (X, C¢).!7 This will not in general be the case,
as we shall see for the p53-mdm2 genetic regulatory and Krebs cycle models.

(b) Krebs cycle

The major portion of a eukaryotic cell’s energy requirements are met by the breakdown of sugars,
with glucose as the principal source.
