“postgastrular” condition is derived from that preceding it. In a previous section
of this paper it has been shown that this transition is characterised by (a) a relatively
enormous prolongation of the archenteron, the primitive or archénteric knot being
continued onwards by means of the archenteric plate ; (b) by an extension forwards,
from the “ primitive-streak area,” of the differentiative process which leads to the
establishment of the “embryonic” or pellucid area as shown in text-fig. 8. This
includes, as its posterior component, the original “ primitive-streak area,” whilst
anteriorly it comprises the entire region traversed by the, now greatly elongated,
’ archenteric axis. A further characteristic of the attainment of the postgastrular
condition is (c) the intimate apposition of the anterior end of the primitive streak
with the posterior boundary of the archenteric knot, so that an appearance of
confluence or continuity is presented, as in the case of the ordinary mammalian
primitive streak and Huensen’s knot. Were it not for the fact of the original
distinctness of these two structures in the preceding stage, the faint demarcation
between them which persists at the present stage might possibly have been
overlooked, in series of transverse sections. The serial photomicrographs, figs. 29-33,

Plate 7, represent the critical sections through the hinder end of the knot, of which
text-fig. 10, p. 73, shows a mesial-plane-reconstruction. These yield evidence sufficient
to prove that the knot retains its individuality even at a period when, on surface
view, it may appear to have become incorporated with the anterior portion of the
primitive streak.
