they are scattered and no trace of the mandibular arch remains. It seems therefore that
the attachment of the hyoid arch to the mandibular arch was no closer than its associa-
tion with the first branchial.

The first structures associated with the branchial arches to be calcified are the gill-
rakers. These first appear at the point of angulation of each arch between the epi- and
cerato-branchial, and form a short series with a very characteristic festoon appearance,
the attached bases of the denticles making a narrow U. It seems certain that the
development of these structures began on the first arch, the others following in turn,
the gill-rakers on the fifth arch only appearing in really large fish in which the ossi-
fication of the mandibular arch is complete.

The fact of the existence of so many different species in Lebach makes it impossible
to trace the course of this calcification in detail. When fully developed in the largest
heads, e.g. D.M.S.W. P. 323, and Pollichia II, the first branchial arch contains four
bones. The pharyngo-branchial is a bone of characteristic shape which, in contrast to
the equivalent cartilage in all Elasmobranchs, is directed forward, its ventral border
continuing the curve of the epi-branchial. Its upper border has a small roughened
projection, relatively thin from side to side. The posterior end of this bone in the
largest specimens approaches the anterior end of the epi-branchial, which is a laterally
flattened cylinder of bone. The angulation of the arch lies in the wide space between

the epi- and cerato-branchials. The laterally flattened cerato-branchial is a bone of
considerable length whose anterior end lies about in the plane of the hinder end of the
lower jaw. The arch then contains a long slender hypo-branchial bone which directly
