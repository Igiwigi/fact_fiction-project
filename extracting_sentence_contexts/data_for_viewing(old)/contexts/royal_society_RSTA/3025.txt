also be treated as pure implying S(B, N,R) =0, S(B, N) = S(R), S(B, R) = S(N), S(N, R) = S(B) and
hence I(B,N : R) = 1(B: R) + I(N: R) which is therefore bounded below by

I(B:R) +1(N:R) > 1(R’:R). (1.2)


Complete evaporation 1(a)(ii): After the pure state black hole has completely evaporated away 4 |
the net radiation, (R,R’), should also be in a pure quantum state to preserve unitarity, so that

S(R’, R) = 0. Thus one might expect that correlations would exist between the early and late epoch “3
radiation, R and R’, respectively. :

In fact, the study of random unitary operations allows us to say much more: as the Hilbert ig
space dimensionalities involved are so huge Levy’s lemma guarantees a generic behaviour for : a

entropy in all but a set of measure zero of evaporation mechanisms [3]. (Indeed Levy’s lemma
can be interpreted as implying that mechanisms with behaviour different from the generic will be
exponentially unstable to any but a set of measure zero of perturbations.)

The consequences of random unitary evaporation [3,12] may be succinctly summarized: the

entropy of the radiation grows monotonically (at almost exactly the maximal rate of one bit’s : &
worth of entropy per qubit of radiation emitted) until the Page time (PT), when the black hole’s Dos
area has halved. From the PT onward, the overall entropy in the radiation decreases at the same : =
rate, reaching zero when evaporation is complete [3,12]. (Note that the terms ‘bits’ and ‘qubits’ are : a
