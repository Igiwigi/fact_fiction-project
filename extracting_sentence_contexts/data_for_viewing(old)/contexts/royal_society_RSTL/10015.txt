ganglia, but, on the contrary, clear evidence that it is able to accelerate that rate, and
although the large majority of my curves point directly to that conclusion, yet occa-
Sionally a curve is obtained in which an undoubted lowing has taken place. In gome
cases it is possible that the slowing may be due to the failure of certain impulses to
produce a contraction as is undoubtedly the case in the slower ventricular beats seen
in Plate 69, fig. 15, where the stimulation of the vagus caused the ventricle to beat for
a time synchronously with every second auricular beat. On the other hand, snch
Slowing as is seen in Plate 67, fig. 13, where the recovery of the rate of rhythm after
the end of the stimulation was gradual both in auricles and ventricle, cannot be
explained, except upon the supposition that the nerve stimulation had slowed the rate
of the discharges from the motor ganglia.

Indeed, the fact that the vagus is able to cause a glowing of the heart's rhythm is 80
well established as not to admit of donbt ; all I contend for is, that that glowing is not
always a 8fficient explanation of the phenomenon known as vagus inhibition.

Further, I venture to suggest that the hypothesis that the angus contains two gets
of fibres going to the motor ganglia, of which the one canses upon stimulation accelera-
tion, the other a slowing of the rate of discharge from the motor ganglia, is no more
necessary than the similar 8upposition that the nerve contains two sets of fibres SUP-

plying the muscular tissue, of which the one causes a diminution, the other an increase
of the force of the contractions.

The experiment from which Plate 67, fig. 13, is taken shows clearly the rapid diminution of the power
