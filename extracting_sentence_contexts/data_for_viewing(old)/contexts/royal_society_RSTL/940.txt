by their remoyal on shore, the acceleration must have ceased ;
which will appear upon consideration.

A s8imilar circumstance was observed by Lieut. FRANKLIN:
to. take place with the chronometers on board the Trent,
which were four in number; and he observes, © It may be

« many chronometers altering their rates the same way, is
* curious, but I am not aware that any cause can be as-

The effect produced upon one or two of the chrono-
meters by their removal to land, was very remarkable; a
chronometer made by BairD was (by observations taken on
shore near where the ships lay at anchor, by Lieutenants
FRANKLIN and BEEcaEy, with false horizon, and eight inch
reflecting eircles of TrRouGaToN, from August 8, A.M. to
