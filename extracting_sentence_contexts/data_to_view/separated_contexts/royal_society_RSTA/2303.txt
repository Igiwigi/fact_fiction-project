Additionally, in these figures, we also show the distributions of three measures: the quantity
5F, mentioned above, and the norms of difference between the consecutive iterative steps
WRiga — Rn lo, Wy — Zi lz, to provide a fuller picture of the numerical method’s rate of
convergence. One can observe in figure 3 that the iterative method (3.6) converges faster (in terms of the
number of iterations) and gives more accurate results for higher values of L,. However, it is
important to account for the fact that functions Z*(t) and R~(f) oscillate with frequencies that
grow as we increase L,. and, consequently, a larger number of mesh nodes N are needed to account
for this. This, in turn, makes each individual iteration more time-consuming. To further clarify this point, and the dependence of the final algorithm on the number of
integration points N, in figure 4 the same graphs are provided for fixed N = 800 with differing
values of L,.
