So the energy received per second by a given small area A at that place, facing t

source, 7.¢c., normal to the rays, is

The radiation at distance 7 from the source is, in fact, the same as what tl
radiation would be at distance p in a stationary medium; except for the sm
inclination e.

So a pair of similar thermopiles, fore and aft, at equal distances from a sour
will, or. this hypothesis, receive unequal radiation ; the difference being equal
4a (PA/4mr°), or proportional to 4a.

Fizeav suggested this method, but I am not aware of its having been tried yet.*
