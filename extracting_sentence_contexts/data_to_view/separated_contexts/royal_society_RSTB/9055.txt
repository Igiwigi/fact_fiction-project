The ability to hear two
objects when a harmonic is mistuned appears to emerge in
human infancy at around the same age as the ability to
derive pitch from sounds with missing fundamentals
[46,69], consistent with the idea that both are part of the
same process of ASA. Music often consists of more than
one sound at a time. As with the perception of pitch itself,
the ability to perceive multiple simultaneous musical lines
appears to be based on the evolution of ASA, again consistent
with musical structure being a consequence of the human


auditory system rather than music driving the evolution of change little over small time periods, reflecting the fact that 5 |

Other aspects of musical pitch structure also appear to be the frequency of the sounds produced. That this is a promi- a

the physical properties of the basilar membrane are such that depicted in figure 2, A [41].
