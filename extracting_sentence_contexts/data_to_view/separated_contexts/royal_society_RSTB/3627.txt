I quote this case more fully than otherwise I should have done, had it not been that
the case, in so far as restoration of movements of the face independent of those of the
shoulder are concerned, has been by some writers apparently misunderstood. Thus
SHERREN (43) writes in 1906, “ Until recently no case had been recorded in which
dissociated voluntary movements were restored. In 1904, THoRBURN wrote of facio-
accessory anastomosis, ‘ this latter fact rendered these operations of comparatively
slight real benefit.’ Other writers who collected: cases from the literature came to
the same conclusion.” A reference to the paper (20), in which my case was published,
will show that independent voluntary dissociated movements were restored, as
far as the eyelids were concerned, commencing on the 49th day and gradually
improving up to the time of publication.
