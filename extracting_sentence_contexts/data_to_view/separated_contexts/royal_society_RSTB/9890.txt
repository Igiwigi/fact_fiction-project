Thus, it is possible to determine from the ‘S
likely effectiveness of different designs appeared to generate Ss

data whether greater adaptation was associated with lower
levels of similarity. Interestingly, in spite of strong support 3
for the hypothesis that simplification would be stronger in
chains of children, there was no difference between the two S
populations in the between-generation error measures. This =5
suggests that increased rate of simplification was not simply  &
attributable to the children making more errors, so in fact =
they must have made qualitatively different errors that were © &
more likely to shift responses in the direction of greater struc-
tural simplicity. So, although it is not possible to say from = =
these data what effect an increase or decrease in error rate = =
might have had in relation to the rate of adaptation in either
adults or children, this clearly demonstrates that similar error
rates do not necessarily dictate equivalent rates of adaptation. Currently, there appears to be very limited evidence of the
effects of different rates of retention on measures involving pro-
posed cultural attractors.
