high extracellular NaCl increases reactive oxygen species
(ROS), causes DNA damage and promotes senescence

to chemical stressors and actively avoided them. As a

Figure 6. Mean migration speed following a dormancy period. Two groups of
10 large plasmodia of two different ages, 60 (old) and 100 (very old) weeks
old, were used to conduct this experiment. Before the migration speed assays,
slime moulds were either turned into sclerotia for a week and teinitiated
(dormancy: yes) or kept as plasmodia (dormancy: no). The substrates were
made of oat gel 5% w/v (oat) or plain agar gel 1% w/v (agar). N = 80
for each age (old and very old) and each treatment (dormancy yes or no).
Total number of assays = 640. Error bars indicate 95% Cl.
