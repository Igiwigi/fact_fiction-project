It seems likely that this may be due to the
platinum being more completely covered with lime in some cases than in others, for it
will be readily understood that the cathode could not be quite uniformly covered with
calcium at each attempt by the method of sublimation. In order to obtain more
accurate knowledge of the values of these constants, experiments must be made with
very carefully prepared lime cathodes. Meanwhile, the fact that a large emission of
negative corpuscles takes place from a Nernst filament at high temperatures seems
to indicate that in experiments with lime-covered cathodes the corpuscles proceed
from the oxide, and not from the platinum underneath. In view of the experiments of Professor Wi1ison, which have shown that the
presence of hydrogen enormously increases the negative leak from platinum, it was
thought to be interesting to see if the leak from lime was increased by admitting
hydrogen into the apparatus. It was found that this is the case, the leak in
hydrogen being many times greater than in helium or oxygen.
