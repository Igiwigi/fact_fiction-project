To overcome the specificity issues noted above, future HRV research may need to redefine
and exploit complexity assessments at a brain—body level. To this end, multivariate complexity
measures [89] using multiple brain and cardiovascular derived time series may be used to
characterize disease states at a brain-heart level. The appealing theory of complexity matching [90]


may also be exploited to characterize the role of complex interactions between the cardiovascular
and nervous systems through the assessment of crucial events, which are generated by the
processes of system self-organization.

One brain-heart mechanism identified begins with the immune system which is linked to the
brain via the autonomic nervous system [91], yielding the possibility that HRV measurements
may be affected by inflammation. In fact, brain inflammation associated with the central renin-
angiotensin system has been found to be involved in the sympathoexcitation of CHF, and
cytokine regulation is also affected by the sympathetic nervous and endocrine systems via the
hypothalamic-pituitary axis [92]. Other examples involve the so-called neurocardiology axis [93,94],
which has been hypothesized to be important in risk stratification after myocardial infarction,
during CHF and after heart transplant. Other interesting brain—body-—heart interactions have been :
found in emotional disorders, where depression has been associated with a 30-90% greater risk of :s
coronary heart disease [95]. Depressive disorders also affect autonomic nervous system dynamics ‘=
as demonstrated with HRV markers in the frequency and nonlinear/complex domains [96,97]. 8
