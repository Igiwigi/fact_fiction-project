upon schists and gneisses, upon which, in the hills E. of Wei-si, lie remnants of the
Minchia Series ; this series has been intruded by various porphyries and some felsite.


GEOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF CHINESE TIBET, ETC. 195

We saw no direct evidence of the intrusion of the granite into the Minchia Series, but
only into the older schists and gneiss; but that the granite also is post-Minchia is
probable from the evidence seen farther to the N.

$6. The Ying-an River to the Mekong,

Amongst other evidence of great changes in the river system of this region is the fact
that many of the tributaries flow northward, in the direction opposite to that of the
river which they join. Thus, the Ying-an River rises near a windgap 8.8.E. of Wei-si,
flows past that town and reaches the Mekong after a northward flow in a direct line of
25 miles. At Wei-si a broad valley separates tae high gneiss range to the W. and the
hills formed of the Minchia Series and igneous rocks near the Li-ti-ping.

The Ying-an River a little N. of Wei-si flows past a bluff on the eastern bank of Minchia
limestone and buff shales which dip to the W. These beds are much disturbed and have
been altered by the intrusion of rhyolite (285, 286). The shales and sandstones are also
disturbed by some movement which is probably a fault along the Wei-si valley. Farther
N. the Minchia limestone and its shales strike N. by W. and have resumed the eastward
dip which is usual on the eastern bank of the valley. At Si-ku-fu, three miles from Wei-si,
