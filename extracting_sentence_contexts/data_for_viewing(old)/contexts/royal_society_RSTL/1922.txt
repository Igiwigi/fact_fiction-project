made similar computations for Paris and Copenhagen, the only two places be-
sides London where obseryations are recorded for any length of time, and in
both these the agreements between the computed and obseryed variations are
$till more approximate than in London.

Now it must be considered very extraordinary that such remarkable agree-
ments as these should obtain in three places, between the computed and ob-
served variations, through more than thirty degrees of change, or for a period
of 170 years, if the hypothesis of a polar revolution were not founded in fact.
As8uming then, that, from whatever cause it may proceed, snch a revolution
does take place, how are we to account for those stationary, or nearly station-
ary, points of no variation to which reference has been made?

The only reply to this question appears to be, that there is no determinate
pole to which all needles point, but that every place has its own particular
pole and polar reyolution, governed probably by some one general but at pre-
sent unknown canse. Should this be the case, and the magnetic pole of any
place be nearly coincident with the terrestrial pole, the line of no variation,
notwithstanding the rotation, must remain nearly stationary ; but such sta-
tionary position is impossible where the variation is considerable, although the
change ought to be very slow on this hypothesis while it is passing through its
