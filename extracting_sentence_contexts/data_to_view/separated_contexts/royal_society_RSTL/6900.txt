But these
fluctuations have a limit, which limit seems to me to have been greatly exceeded during
the height of the glacial period. Looking at the special nature of such a remarkable
reduction of temperature, closing as it were a vast cycle of anterior geological changes,
and seeing its exceptional nature with reference to the general indications of higher
temperatures which previously prevailed, I confess I feel deeply and strongly impressed
with the probability that in this unexpected snccession of changes we may trace evi-
dence of great and all-wise design. If the cause were general (and there are strong
reasons to believe that such was the case), the fact of the earth having been subjected
to the severe and rigorous temperature of the glacial period must have led to a more
rapid abstraction of heat from the surface than would have occurred without the inter-
vention of a cold period, establishing, as it were in anticipation, a state of equilibrium
which might otherwise have been indefinitely deferred had the refrigeration been gra-
dual and uninterrupted; for on the removal or cessation of the refrigerating cause,
the surface would be left in a condition to suffer for a certain period little or no further
loss by radiation and no further contraction. 'The state of repose thus effected may
have helped to impart to the earth's crust that stability and immobility which render
it fit and suitable for the habitation of civilized man.
