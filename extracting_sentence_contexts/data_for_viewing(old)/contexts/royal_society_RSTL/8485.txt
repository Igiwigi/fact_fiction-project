to verify which observe that, substituting herein for \y its value 1 += , the equation

becomes

(20+ 328% —1)(v +21?) — $vu(v + 21% +1)=0 ;
that is, y

2+ 41% — 4vu—21*=0, as it should do.

33. Any expression whatever of M in terms of v, v is in fact one of a system of four
expressions; viz. we may simultaneously change
