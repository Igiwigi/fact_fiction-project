to obtain groups of cells in G1. The only opportunities are
either to inspect the embryo very frequently in order to
observe the moment of cell division or to arrest the embryos
in mitosis for several hours before releasing them. In either
case, the cells can then be used as nuclear donors during
the time period when they are expected to be passing through
G1 phase, without further assessment. These procedures are
effective, but time consuming and tedious.

Emboldened by this new understanding, the group then
went on to transfer nuclei from cultured cells derived from
embryos. ES cells have not been derived from ungulate
embryos despite the fact that a considerable effort has been
made. During attempts to derive such lines, it was common
experience that after a few passages there were no cells
which resembled ES cells. The initial objective of the exper-
iment was to transfer nuclei from the culture as this
happened. The expectation was that as cells differentiated it
would be more difficult to obtain offspring after nuclear
transfer. ES cells are derived from the inner cell mass or epi-
blast, and the expectation was that the proportion of cloned
embryos that developed would decrease as differentiation
occurred. In this way, we would learn more about the
developmental potential of cells in the culture.
