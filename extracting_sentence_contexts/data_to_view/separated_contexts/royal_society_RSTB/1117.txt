We therefore give as examples the following :—In one case, on exciting
tee sciatic of a profoundly etherised animal (Cat) with a weak but adequate
samulus for 5 seconds, the galvanometric cord effect was 76 scale; the animal was
then less etherised and the effect was 220 scale. On again deeply etherising the effect
wath the same excitation sank to 130 ; upon the ether being then more or less removed,
tBe excitation produced an effect of 200; whilst on renewed profound etherisation
tis was only 80. In all these cases very feeble reflexes or none were observed in
the profoundly etherised animal, but the reflexes were well marked when with less
n&rcosis the larger electrical changes were noted.

‘~These differences evidently point clearly to the fact that the electrical change may
net only be that due to the transmitted nerve impulses up direct tracts, but also to
tBe presence of interposed cellular mechanisms and their susceptibility of response
te the arrival of afferent impulses. In Chapter III. we have discussed the value
the use of ether as a means of discriminating between the functional activity of
fires and of fibres plus cells, to that chapter we refer the reader, merely remarking
now that we must not lose sight of the fact that etherisation, especially when very
profound, may affect the nature of the excitatory processes in the nerve fibres them-
selves, as in the experiments made on the nerve of the Frog by BreDERMANN with ether
vapour. The differences between effects obtained with unvarying intensity of stimulus
but different degrees of narcosis are practically the same as those obtained with
different strengths of excitation and unvarying but not too profound anzsthesia.
