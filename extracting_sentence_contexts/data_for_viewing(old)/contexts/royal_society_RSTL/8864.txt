The nerves themselves are invested by the hyaline membrane spoken of above; and
surrounding this again there is present a delicate mesoblastic investment. of spindle-
$haped cells.

Longitudinal sections also throw light upon the constitution of the anterior nerve-roots
(vide fig. K 11, ar). In the two 8egments on the left-hand side in this figure the anterior
roots are cut through as they are proceeding, in a more or less horizontal course, from
the spinal cord to the muscle-plates. _

Where the section (which is not quite horizontal) passes throngh the plane of the
notochord, as on the right-hand side, the anterior roots are cut transversely. Each root,
in fact, changes its direction, and takes a downward course.

The anterior roots are situated nearly opposite the middle of the muscle-plates:
their section is much smaller than that of the posterior roots, and with hamatoxylin
they stain more deeply than any of the other cells in the preparation.

The anterior roots, 80 far as T have been able to observe, do not at this stage unite
with the posterior ; but on this point I do not speak with any confidence.

The period now arrived at forms a convenient break in the development of the spinal
nerves; and I hope to treat the remainder of the subject, especially the changes in the
ganglion, the deyelopment of the ganglion-cells, and of the nerve-fibres, in a subsequent
paper.
