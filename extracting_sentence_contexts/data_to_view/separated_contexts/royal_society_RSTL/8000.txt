If in this mode of generation the points common to the three spheres be real, two of the four nodes of the
eyclide will be real and two imaginary. If the points common to the three spheres be imaginary, the four nodes of the cyclide will be imaginary, In
this case it is evident the three spheres may bo inverted into three spheres whose centres are collinear; now the
envelope of a variable sphere which touches three spheres whos centres are collinear is evidently a ring formed
by the revolution of a circle round an axis in its plane. Hence the inverse of 8uch a ring is @ quadrinodal cyclide
whose four nodes are imaginary ; in fact, a ring formed by tho revolution of a circle round an axis in its plane
is a quadrinodal cyclide which has two imaginary nodes at infinity.

11. The envelope of the sphero

(a=aY+(1—BY+(2—a=m{(4—0 +29,
which cuts orthogonally the plano z=a, will, if &, Þ vary, be a cone of royolution, that is the envelope of
+ +2—2(2v+8y+0z)+(1-m)(2+ 3) +2nf%ca+@—mo=0;

or, putting for a moment
1-m)(a* +) + 2n%ca +0? —n*f=Q,
the envelope of ( foe

a*+y*+2—Aav+Py+az)+Q=0
is a cone of reyolution, Now the sphere inverse to

#+3y*+2—Aav+8y+az)+Q
