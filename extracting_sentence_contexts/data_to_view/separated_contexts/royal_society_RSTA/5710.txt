Therefore, we need div w = 0, w smooth enough; Do
and we look for a vector field with compact support, say in the closed ball B(0,1), so that for :®
ré (0,5) and z €Ay CDs the rescaled and shifted vector field w,(x — z) is zero on 0D. Moreover, Dw
we need other two properties. :3
One is that w(x) is close to (1/27)(x+/|x|?) near x=0; this is central to the proof that the [S
function q(x) is large. The other is that the vector fields w,(x—z) are (up to the constant
f |w(x)|? dx, which is not zero since w is close to (1/27)(x+/|x|?) near x = 0) ‘almost’ orthonormal
in L”, which is guaranteed by the fact that the supports are ‘almost’ disjoint. To be precise, if we
take truly disjoint supports, then the action of w;(x — z) does not cover the full set D2: there are
intermediate zones between the supports, where w,(x — z) does not move space points and this is
in contrast with the requirement that q(x) should be large everywhere in D5. This is why we have
introduced M and the sets AMMKo lo) above: inside each one of these classes the supports will be
disjoint and this is sufficient for our estimates; in order to have the supports disjoint for elements
of AME Io) we ask r < (M/2N).
