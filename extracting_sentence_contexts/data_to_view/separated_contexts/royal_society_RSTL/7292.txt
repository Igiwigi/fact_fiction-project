Having now pretty fully explained the anatomy of the Nematoids, we shall be abls,
with the aid of the many new facts revealed concerning their structure, to consider the
question of their affinities and homologies with more chance of success than formerly,
8 that we may hope to throw some light upon this difficult 8ubject. Hitherto, t6
those anatomists who penetrate beyond mere external form, the Nematoids have been
regarded almost as an outlying group, having no definite relationship with other
animals, and admitting only of a provisional location "in the convenient though
utterly artificial class Entozoa. In the first volume of his © Elements of Comparative
Anatomy '* recently published, Professor HuxLEY has done much to elucidate the
homologies of the *Annuloid” animals; and as well from the philosophic nature of
his views as from the fact that he is the latest writer of note who has treated on the
classification of the Animal Kingdom, it seems desirable for me briefly to refer to some
of these views in order that we may be able more fully to appreciate the state of the
question concerning the affinities of the Nematoids. In his * Lectures on General Natural History'* he divided the subkingdom AnNULOSk
into two great divisions, the ARTICULATA or ARTHROPODA and the ANNULOIDA; including
in the former division Insecta, Myriapeda, Orustacea, and Arachnida, whilst in the
latter he placed Annelida, Echinodermata, and Scolecida—the latter being a name under
which he till proposes to include the Entozoa, Turbellarice, and Rotifere. In the recently published workFf, however, this classification is somewhat modified;
8ince whilst acknowledging that * the members of the class Annelida present marked
differences from all the Arthropoda, but resemble them in one important particular, and
that is the arrangement of the nervous system, which constitutes a ganglionated double
chain traversed at one point by the cesophagus,” still he now thinks « that the resem-
blances between the Annetida and Arthropoda outweigh the differences, and that the
characters of the nervous system and the frequently segmented body, with imperfect
lateral appendages of the former, necessitate their assemblage with the Arthropoda into
one great division or subkingdom of ANNULOsA.”
