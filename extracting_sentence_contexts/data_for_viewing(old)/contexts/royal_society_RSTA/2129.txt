analytical solution of such a general oscillation is available. Historically, this fact might have
worked as an obstacle to hitting on the idea that this intractable mathematical object can still
be chosen as the starting point of a perturbation theory of reduction. This may partly explain the
reason why the appearance of the phase reduction theory is relatively new compared, e.g. with
the asymptotic theory of weakly nonlinear oscillations.

(a) Definition of phase

Let the time-periodic solution of X = F(X) with frequency w be given by a 27-periodic function
x(¢), where the phase ¢ varies as ¢ = wt + . The initial phase w is an arbitrary constant. As
noted in the introductory section, when the system’s continuous symmetry has been broken, an
arbitrary parameter must appear in the mathematical expression of the symmetry-broken state.
This fact is true of the present case, because the limit-cycle oscillation breaks the translational
symmetry in time, resulting in an arbitrary parameter yw.

In conformity to the basic idea of phase reduction, we reinterpret the arbitrary constant as a
dynamical variable, and absorb the effect of perturbation into y(t) to cause its slow evolution.

Up to this point, the phase ¢ represents a one-dimensional coordinate defined along the closed
orbit C in such a way that the free motion of the oscillator on C satisfies ¢@ =o. When the oscillator
is perturbed, however weak the perturbation may be, it will generally be kicked off the closed
orbit C. In order that the phase may still have a definite meaning, we have to extend its definition
outside C. Although we only need to define it in the vicinity of C, let us begin with its global
definition by defining a scalar field ¢(X) for a general point X in the phase space [17].
