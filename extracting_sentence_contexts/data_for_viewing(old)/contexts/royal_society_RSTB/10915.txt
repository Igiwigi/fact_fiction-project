mammalian reproductive strategies was subsequently modi-
fied by recognizing that it can also pay for male mammals
to be choosy under certain circumstances [13,77—80], if only
by strategically allocating sperm [81], and that females can
also compete with each other over mates and reproductive
opportunities [1,82—86]. Hence, the fundamental sex roles
of mammals are obviously constrained by internal, biologi-
cal traits, but there are also interesting cases of intra- and
interspecific variation in sex roles, including paternal care
[87,88]. Thus, mammalian sex roles are generally, but not
invariably constrained by a fundamental life-history trait,
and models attempting to predict this variation among
mammalian species need to take this fact into account.

Moreover, species-specific life-history traits, such as the
length of gestation and lactation, can also affect sex roles
through their impact on OSR. Specifically, a bias in the
OSR can create frequency-dependent selection favouring
increased mate guarding and reduced parental care by the
sex facing more intense completion for mates [4,89,90]. In
species where one sex is committed to parental care, the
effects of ASR variation might be magnified by the OSR
and more probably affect mate acquisition or mate guarding
strategies than parental care [38]. I will illustrate some practi-
cal problems associated with spatial and temporal variation
