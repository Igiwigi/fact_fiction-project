(b) Towards reprogramming to or from neurons
Mature neurons, which have exited from the cell cycle, have
low efficiency of reprogramming to iPSCs by simultaneous
expression of OCT4, SOX2, C-MYC and KLF4 [91]. In this
context, it is interesting to note that p53 suppression is crucial 5. Concluding remarks
for efficient reprogramming of neurons to iPSCs. Although
neurons and glial cells are generated from common NSCs,
it is much easier to reprogramme glial cells and NSCs into
iPSCs than to similarly reprogramme neurons [92,93]. The
efficiency of transdifferentiation, like that of reprogramming
to iPSCs, also depends on the cell type. These facts would
lead to the expectation that neurons may exhibit lower
potency of transdifferentiation into different lineages com-
pared with the transdifferentiation potency of glial cells,
because neurons are post-mitotic cells.

Transdifferentiation is the conversion of a differentiated cell
to alternative lineage(s), such as conversion from fibroblasts to
neurons [94-97]. Regarding glial cells, we have previously
shown that activation of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway
can induce transdifferentiation from oligodendrocytes into
astrocytes [98]. Pericytes, a cell type implicated in the establish-
ment and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, isolated
