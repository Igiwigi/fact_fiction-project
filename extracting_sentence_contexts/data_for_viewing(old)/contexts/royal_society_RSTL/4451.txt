* «The leading principle of the chemists,” says Dr, Bosrock (op. cit. p. 138), © was, that the living body is
8ubject to the same chemical laws with inanimate matter, and that all the phenomena of vitality may be explained
by the operation of these laws,” The chemical physicians of the seventeenth century held * that the operations
of the living body are all guided by chemical actions, of which one of the most important and the most universal
is fermentation. The states of health and discase were supposed to be ultimately referable to certain fermenta-
tions, which took place in the blood or other fluids ; while these fluids themselves were the result of specific
fermentations, by which they were elaborated from the elements of which the body is composed” (op. cit.
p. 157).

+ © We are told,” says Dr. Bosrock (op. cit. p. 175), © that the anima superintends and directs every part

morbid causex, or tends to remove them when actually present, yet that we are unconscious of its existence ;
and that, while it manifests every attribute of reason and dexign, it is devoid of these qualities, and is, in fact,
a necessary and unintelligent agent.”

of its operation ; following the same mode of inquiry for this purpose, as that which
has been found snccessful in other departments of scientific investigation. In doing
this, it has been necessary for them to isolate, as much as possible, those phenomena
which may be regarded as Chemical or Physical, from those which mnst be distin-
guished as Vital ; in order that, by the collocation and comparison of the latter, their
mutual relations may be discovered. Still, after making every possible allowance
for the operation of chemical and physical agencies, in the direct production of the
