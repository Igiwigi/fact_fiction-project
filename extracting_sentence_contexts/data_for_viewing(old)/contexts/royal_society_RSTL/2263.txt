It is obvious from the preceding facts, that the property of
supporting combustion, which this liquid possesses to 80 great
a degree, is not owing solely to the chlorine which it contains,
but likewise to the oxygen of the chromic acid ; which, as

we $hall see afterwards, constitutes 80 considerable a portion
of it. So that chromic acid is a supporter of combustion, as

well as nitric acid, and nearly to as great an extent. Indeed
this might have been inferred from several facts already
known. I may mention, as an example, the property which
it has of effervescing with tartaric acid, and giving out abun-
dance of carbonic aid.

Neither nitric acid, muriatic acid, iodine, oxygen, or chlo-
rine, have any sensible action on the red liquid.

When the red liquid is exposed to heat it gives out
chlorine, and is gradually converted into a brown mass, solid
while cold, but readily melting when heated. This brown
matter deliquesces when left exposed to the air. When
strongly heated it swells out, and at last assumes the form
