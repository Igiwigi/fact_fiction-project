Any direct evi-
dence, or even theoretical or conceptual work, on connections
between sub-MICs and eco-evolutionary feedbacks is still
missing. This information would, however, most probably
be critical in understanding how antibiotic resistance spreads
in natural bacterial communities.

(c) Molecular analysis tools enable studying eco-
evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance in the

wild
Development of molecular techniques has been crucial for
increasing our understanding of the evolution of antibiotic

resistance in microbial communities. Importantly, they are
not subject to the culture bias caused by the fact that only a
small minority of bacterial species can be cultivated with
the current methodology [59]. Metagenomic analysis based
on high-throughput DNA sequencing is essential for under-
standing the eco-evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic
resistance in a community context [60]. Long-read sequen-
cing technologies such as PacBio RS [61] and Oxford
Nanopore MinION [62] are important as they facilitate the
assembly of long contigs thereby facilitating identifying geno-
mic areas under selection.
