Intensive research on
battery concepts based on lithium metal anodes such as Li-S and Li-air technologies have despite
large theoretical promise, proven many intrinsic issues related to safety, e.g. dendritic growth
of Li and mechanistic bottlenecks, e.g. polysulfide dissolution or reactivity of radicals to be
showstoppers [4-6]. Sodium metal, as lithium, has also a tendency to dendritic growth [7]. This
fact coupled to its relatively low melting point (approx. 98Â°C) makes it an even less safe anode.

However, magnesium or calcium seem to be less prone to dendrite formation, potentially due to
the lower self-diffusion barriers of the adatom during plating [8-10]. The use of these light metals
couples the advantages of high theoretical volumetric capacity (figure 1) with natural abundance,
low cost and safety.
