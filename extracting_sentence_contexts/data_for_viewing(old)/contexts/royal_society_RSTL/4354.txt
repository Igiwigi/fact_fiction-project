fact the formula Cy+2HO correctly represents the composition, and the 8ubstance
may be supposed to be formed by the union of cyanogen in its nascent state with
2 equivs. of water. When this white snbstance is treated with acids, it is converted
into oxalic acid and ammonia. This fact, together with the analysis, proves it to be
Oxamive*®*. Its occurrence in a process of oxidation is very surprising, and perhaps
may throw some doubts on the theoretical compoxsition ascribed to it, 2CO+NH,.
There is little doubt that this substance is the same as that observed by VavaueunÞ
in a watery s0lution of cyanogen, which however was not analysed by him. The
description which he gives applies closely to oxamide. Wourtrf also observed two
substances in a watery solution of eyanogen, one of which may be this body. The
appearance of carbonic acid is now explained, as it is obviously due to an oxidation
of the oxalic acid produced by the transformation of the oxamide.
