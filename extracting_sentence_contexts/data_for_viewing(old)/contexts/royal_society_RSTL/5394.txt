On heating a portion of the substance with soda-lime in a green glass retort, am-
monia was first plentifully disengaged ; but on raising the heat a yellowish oily liquid
distilled over, which in the course of half an hour solidified into a crystalline mass,
having the peculiar smell of the aniline class of organic bases. Although no doubt
was entertained that this substance was toluidine, it was thought desirable to deter-

mine the fact experimentally. Three or four grammes of the new snbstance were
therefore distilled with caustic potash, and the solid product, after having been washed
two or three times with water, was saturated with an alcoholic solution of oxalic acid.
It was evaporated to dryness on the water-bath, then redissolved in boiling alcohol
and filtered; the crystals which separated on cooling were washed with cold distilled
warer, then redissolved in boiling water, and decomposed by caustic potash ; some
clear oily drops separated, which were dissolved in ether, and the etherial solution
evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and mixed
with an alcoholic s0lution of bichloride of platinum; a fine orange-coloured crystal-
line mass was obtained, which was washed with ether and dried on the water-bath.
It was decomposed by ignition in a porcelain crucible.
