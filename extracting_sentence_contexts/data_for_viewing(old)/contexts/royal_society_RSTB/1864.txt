seem to be with the Schizeacez rather than the Marattiacesw. In the fact that it is
perhaps the earliest recorded fern in which the details of the sporangia are well
enough preserved to form a basis for comparison, I see no sufficient reason for
regarding it as a Marattiaceous ancestor, or even as representing a condition ever
passed through in the evolution of the Marattiacese. Moreover, it. is not the
earliest known fern; those of the Devonian period have also to be remembered,
while in the Culm there is evidence of a considerable and varied fern flora: this has
been brought into prominence afresh by Sotms-Laupacu’s recent revision of the
fossil plants described by Uncrr from the Unter-Culm (‘ Abhandl. d. k. Pr. Geol.
Landesanstalt,’ Neue Folge, part 23). The variety of structure of fern petioles there
described is considerable ; it is reasonable to suppose that this variety of vegetative
structure was accompanied by variety of the sorus, and it should at least be a
warning against generalisation in such a case as this from few facts. It is quite
possible that the differentiation both of synangial sori, and of those with separate
sporangia, either grouped in sori or solitary, may have been of much earlier date than
those used as the basis of his argument by Srur.

Another consideration will make the conclusion of Srur seem questionable ;
perhaps no feature in the Marattiacese is more remarkable than the persistence of
type from the remote past to the present day. Srur himself points this out (Joc, cit.,
p. 796). Are we to believe that this type which has virtually stood still through
so many successive geological periods, was so quickly plastic at the Carboniferous
period as to show a progression from a type with entirely separate sporangia, as seen
in Senftenbergia, to the completely synangial condition seen in Danaites, between
the Culm and the lower Coal Measures? I think such a suggestion is improbable,
