We argued above
that the supersymmetric particles should have masses less than 1000GeV or so. This in turn
implies that the LHC, with its centre of mass energies, at 7000 GeV= —14000 GeV, should be
energetic enough to produce the supersymmetric partners. We must note that though that, in
fact, it is the point-like constituents of the protons (the quarks and gluons) that may collide
to produce supersymmetric partners, and they come with some a priori unknown fraction of
the proton’s momentum described phenomenologically by probability distribution functions
in each collision (figure 3). A combination of increasing the energy and recording more
collisions allows for the greatest chance of directly producing the supersymmetric partners. The hope is that, after production, they can be detected and measured in the ATLAS and
CMS general purpose LHC detectors.
