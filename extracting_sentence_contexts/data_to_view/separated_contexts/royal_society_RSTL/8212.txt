This has passed current at, different times in several forms, but
all resting upon the assumption that our planet now and for long past consists of a
liquid nucleus of fused matter at a very high temperature, covered by a solidified crust
of matter chemically much the same, but the materials of the uppermost strata of which
at least have been dislocated, broken up, redeposited, and variously arranged into surface
formations by the long-continued action of those superficial agencies with which the
geologist deals.

11. The hypothesis of the existence of a liquid nucleus intensely hot rests mainly upon
two grounds :—lIst,the nebular origin of our globe in common with all others, as suggested
by LaPLack, by which the interior of a cooling globe must be hotter than the exterior;
2nd, the observation of temperature, which proves to increase with the depth, though in
a very discordant sort of way.

12. That our globe js hotter within than on or near its surface is « Fact, but that it
possesses a liquid nucleus in a tate of fusion is only an hypothesis, though a very
probable one. The rate of increment of temperature with depth, far too hastily asxumed
to follow everywhere one simple arithmeticlaw, and the facts of terrestrial conductivity,

£0 far as these are known, induced the belief that the lid crust is comparatively thin. MR.
