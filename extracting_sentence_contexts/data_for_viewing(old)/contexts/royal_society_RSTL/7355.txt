Geol. de France, vol. iv. pl. 3. figs. 1-3, together with another closely allied variety of
P. Menardii (P. crass«, TY Orb., sp., 10c. cit. figs. 7-8); as well as a third variety
(P. Cordieriana, D'Orb., toc. cit. figs. 9-11), a member of the P. elegans group of P. re-
panda.

At the Hunde Islands this usnally deep-sea form, P. Micheliniana, is represented by
rare and 8mall individuals at 25-30 fathoms.

Plate XVI. figs. 41-43 (North Atlantic).

From the Arctic Ocean we had but very few specimens of P. Micheliniana, owing to
the paucity of deep-sea soundings. In the North Atlantic it is very common ; and
generally very rough or scabrous in its shell-tissue ; in fact it may be said to be here
P. truncatulinoides, D'Orb., sp. (For. Canar. pl. 2. figs. 25-27), and the two forms are
scarcely worth separating by distinct names.

On the Irish marginal plateau it is rare and small in the shallow, rather common and
large in the deep parts. In the © Celtic” abyssal depths it is common and rather large;
but in the © Boreal ” tract (at upwards of 2000 fathoms) it is smaller and rarer; and
nearer to the Bank it is rare and small at 1450 fathoms.

This is a neat, many-chambered, moderately conical variety of P. repanda, with some
