in grasping any instrument of stimulation, and this proves that for a certain area round
any seat of stimulation the spines admit of co-ordinated action. Further experiments
prove that there is no limit to the area within which co-ordinated action of the spines
may take place ; but that all the spines of the organism may work together to the
attainment of some common end. Thus it has already been stated in a previous parb
of this paper that a Spatangus, when placed upon its back, is able to right itself by

the co-ordinated action of its spines alone ; and also that an Zchinus, when taken out,
of the water and placed upon a table, will walk in a determinate direction by the
game means. The very complete co-ordination of the spines implied by these facts is,
however, rendered still more conspicuous by experiments in stimulation ; for if, while
an Fehinus is walking on the table in the manner just alluded to, a scrape with a
scalpel, a drop of spirit, a lighted match, or any other severe stimulus be applied at
ome one part of the animal's exterior, the spines all over the surface begin to take on
an active bristling movement, and the direction of advance is immediately changed
into a straight line of escape from the source of injury, And, were it necessary, other
experiments could be detailed to show that the multitudinons spines of an Echinus
are as closely co-ordinated in their action as 80 many limbs. To this account of the
physiology of the spines ib may be added that the nervous plexus overlying the
tubercles on which they are mounted is more sensitive to stimulation than any other
part of the external plexus. This is shown by the fact that, if the tubercle is stimu-
lated by eneclosing the spine in the tube of a pipette, and pressing the tubercle with
