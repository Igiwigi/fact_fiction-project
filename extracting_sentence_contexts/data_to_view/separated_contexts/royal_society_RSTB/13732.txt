it is impossible to distinguish between Rubble horizon sub-units (Ic (i), Ic (ii) and Ic (iii)) based on the stratigraphic references written on artefacts.

(b) Function

Hypotheses of Lupemban lanceolate function have focused
either explicitly [3, pp. 156-157] or implicitly [6,50,57] on
their potential use as the business end of composite spears
that were either thrown or thrust to kill large terrestrial
game.
