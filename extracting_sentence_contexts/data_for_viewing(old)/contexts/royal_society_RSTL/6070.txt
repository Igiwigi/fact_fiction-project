FS * T hardly think, however, that SaussURE would have subscribed to some of the interpretations of his
S theory now extant.

= + See Hoexrxs in Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxvi. p. 4. Were ib not that this objection is thought-
Q lezsly repeated in every work upon glaciers, I would not dwell upon it here. The objection drawn from the
deportment of secondary glaciers lying on steep slopes is also very commonly dwelt upon, but it is equally
without weight; and applies with at least as much force to the viscous theory as to the theory of SaussURE.

t The name of M. Rexvv will always be honourably associated with the theory of glacier motion. He
first drew attention to the power of the glacier to move through a sinuous valley, to narrow and widen and
behave like lava or like © a 8oft paste.” He conjectured also that the centre would moye more quickly than
the sides. In fact he appears to have had a correct conception of almost all that the 8ubsequent observa-
tions of Professor Foupss established. IT regret to 8ay that T have not been able to obtain M. Renvu's
original memoir.

August 1859.—Thanks to my Ziirich friends, T have recently had the pleasure of reading M. Rexpv's paper,
the Perusal of which has confirmed my estimate of his sagacity. Had this gentleman been a philosopher
instead of an ecclesiastic, we should doubtless have heard more about his claims than we have hitherto done.
