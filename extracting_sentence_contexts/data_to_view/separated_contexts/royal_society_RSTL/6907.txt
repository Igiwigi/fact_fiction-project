The chief fall is in autumn, and the greater portion of it is carried off as it -
falls; and there is rarely any large accumulation of winter snow. 'This fall is 80 small
that it requires but a moderate excess in the fall of any one period of the year to
produce floods which cover the whole breadth of the present valley-channels. Tt
was a fall of only 3% inches* in the twenty-four hours that caused the disastrous floods
of Morayshire and Aberdeenshire in 1829. Amongst the other remarkable facts con-
nected with that event, Sir T. Diox LavpeRfF states that at Invercauld the 8mall river
Dee rose 144 feet above the usual level, and spread 400 yards wide. A tributary stream
cut away 6000 square yards of gravel, and spread the debris oyer thirty acres of land,
Lower down, at Maryfield, the Dee rose 25 feet aboye its ordinary level.
