generates circularly polarized radiation under acceleration. As force F on a charged particle with
a charge q in an electric field E is given by gE, we can multiply both sides of equation (3.2) by q to
get the following expression:

The left-hand side of the equation (4.1) can be transformed into a line integral using Stoke’s
theorem { F -dr=—qd [ B-dS/dt=U, where U is the electric potential energy. Its derivative
along the dimension r leads to, F = 0U/dr or 0V/dr, where V is the electric potential. The force
exerted by the electric field E on another charge q generates a momentum p which can be
expressed as F = qE= dP/dt. The expression defined by equation (4.1) expresses the fact that a
charged particle in an electromagnetic field shows rotational motion and the radiation generated
by it is not linearly but circularly polarized.

The equations discussed earlier can also be expressed using the electromagnetic field tensor
[32], Fuv = 9A,/dx, — 0A,,/dx, where A is magnetic vector potential, x is a dimension in space, ju
and v are subscripts denoting spatial components. The symmetry breaking of the electromagnetic
field tensor can be expressed as 0F,»/0x =J,, , where J,, is the four current vector. The finite
value of spatial variation of dF,,, indicates its symmetry breaking along the spatial dimension
which results in corresponding breaking in symmetry along the temporal domain as expressed
by the finite value of four current vector J,,.
