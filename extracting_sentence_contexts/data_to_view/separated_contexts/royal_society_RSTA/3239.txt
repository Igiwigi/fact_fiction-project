However, if in such a scenario,
one needs to calculate the potential at h > A, and then knowledge about the new degrees of
freedom is mandatory: they start to be relevant for the potential already at the scale A, not at
(A2 + «iPyl/?,

This low-cut-off problem of Higgs inflation is a serious one that has not been solved. Any
imaginable solution would require showing that new physics at A (either new perturbative
degrees of freedom or a strong coupling regime) does not affect the predictions of Higgs inflation
that are obtained by ignoring the unitarity problem.!° That result seems hardly possible given
the fact that whatever new physics shows up at (or below) A, it must be coupled to the Higgs
if it is to fix the unitarity problem. In fact, this way of looking at the problem sheds some light
on the ultimate reason for the unitarity loss. In the original Higgs inflation proposal the Higgs
plays two different roles: unitarizing (and Higgsing) the SM, (for which we know that the Higgs
couplings must be precisely those of the SM Higgs) and inflating. The first task works well in the
low-energy regime, where the couplings of the Higgs are SM-like, but fails beyond A, when the
couplings of x are no longer the SM ones.
