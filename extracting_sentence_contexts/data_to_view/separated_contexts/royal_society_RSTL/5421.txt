Laying hold of the
htopmost block, the whole heap, consisting of several large lumps, was lifted bodily out
<Sof its vessel. Even at this high temperature the pieces were frozen together at the
Splaces of contact, though the ice all round these places had been melted away, leaving
She lumps in some cases united by slender cylinders of the substance. A similar experi-
ment may be made in water as hot as the hands can bear; two pieces of ice will freeze
together, and sometimes continue s0 frozen in the hot water, until, as in the case above
Smentioned, the melting of the ice around the points of contact leaves the pieces united
Sby slender columns of the substance.
z Acquainted with these facts, the thought arose of examining how far, in virtue of the
Ebroperty referred to, the form of ice could be changed without final prejudice to its con-
&tinuity. It was supposed that though crushed by great pressure, new attachments
S would be formed by the cementing, through regelation, of the severed surfaces ; and that
$a resemblance to an effect due to viscosity might be produced. To test this conjecture
Ethe following experiments were made :â€”Two
&pieces of seasoned boxwood, A and B, fig. 2,
4 inches square and 2 deep, had two cavities hol-
lowed out, 80 that when one was placed upon
the other, a lenticular space, shown in section at
C, was enclosed between them.
