The
difference is that cortical types are well-defined biological entities
with a direct structural and functional interpretation (in terms of
neuron density, spine count, branching of intrinsic connections,
neurotransmitter receptor profiles, excitability, and so on),
whereas the levels of the VCH are constructs derived indirectly
from an (indeterminate) sorting process with no such clear
interpretation. The VCH can, therefore, be considered as an
epiphenomenon of the gradients of cortical structure. This
conclusion does not contradict the fact that the VCH may be cor-
related with structural or functional features such as excitability
of cortical areas [49]; however, a explanation for these features
should not be sought in the VCH, but the underlying structural
gradients of the cortex. For instance, excitability may be
explained more fundamentally by variations of neuronal
density versus synaptic density. More generally, as the basic pres-
ence or absence of connections is also linked to the architectonic
similarity of primate cortical areas [30,40,43,69], there exists a
natural relationship between the architectonic gradients of the
cortex described in §3 and the sequential organization of cortical
connections outlined in §2 above.
