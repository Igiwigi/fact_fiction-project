Adherence among layers has been assessed qualitatively by visually
inspecting coated and uncoated specimens cut in half after curing, with curing temperature and
time have been adjusted to ensure layer bonding. Adherence has also been confirmed through
the deformed shape of the specimen during the shear test as shown in figure 10. In this test,
since the composite is layered parallel to the platesâ€™ direction, one would expect the layers to
slide with respect to each other in the absence of bonding, thus, the fact that the specimens
deform as a solid block implies layer bonding. Table 1. Specimens for morphology and chemical characterization.
