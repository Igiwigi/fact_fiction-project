Mortey, who happened to visit our laboratories when pure chlorine was being
prepared by the electrolysis of fused silver chloride. He suggested that we should
burn weighed hydrogen and chlorine in a closed vessel, just as he had burnt weighed
hydrogen and oxygen. After some discussion we decided to make the attemptâ€”an
attempt which was rendered possible by the fact that one of us was enabled, by a
research scholarship, to devote his whole time to the investigation,

A year was spent in designing, making and testing the several parts of the
apparatus. In the second year we put together the pieces and carried through
preliminary experiments, which led to some modifications and further trials. In the
third year the apparatus was got into working order and the determinations made.
