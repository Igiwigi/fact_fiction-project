The highest point of the complete curve is reached at a time 1903°76--nx 11°12,
but there is naturally a good deal of uncertainty as to the dates of the maxima,
within the limits of a year. The positions of the maxima and minima of the harmonic
components as given in Table XIL are marked in fig. 5 by an upward arrow denoting a
maximum and a downward arrow a minimum. The order of the harmonic is indicated
by the figures attached to the arrows. A retardation of 18 months in the principal
maximum may occur owing to the temporary disappearance of the first harmonic, and
does not therefore necessarily indicate an irregularity in the main periodicity.

The discussion of the 11:125 years’ period has been entirely based on the results
& of the last 75 years of last century. Between 1749 and about 1826 the periodogram
4 only gives a faint indication of the period. This remnant I ascribed at first without
further investigation to the fact, that the 11 years’ period had come into life towards
the beginning of the century, and therefore had to some extent affected the interval
1750-1826 to which curve B of fig. 2 applies. This was an error which for some
time kept me off the right track.

The question of the permanence of the periodicities is one of vital importance, and I
s have endeavoured throughout to keep my mind free from all preconceived notions.
Every one thus looking with unprejudiced eyes at the main facts must feel himself
‘2 drawn in opposite directions. On the one hand there is the evidence of the periodo-
gram which indicates almost decisively a new departure at the beginning of the
nineteenth century ; on the other hand we have the remarkable fact that WoLrer,
making use of all the data since 1610, deduced 11°124 years as the most probable
‘g period—a result identical with mine. Similarly Newcoms,* after a most careful
