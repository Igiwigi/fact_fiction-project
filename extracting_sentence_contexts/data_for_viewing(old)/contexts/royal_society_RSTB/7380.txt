a number of Permian corals. These phenomena are generally confined to highly specialized
groups and are of little value in systematics.


IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR MINUTE SKELETAL STRUCTURES 193

Other features such as septal insertion and septal symmetry have already been considered
in the historical account. The analysis of growth-form and method of budding in regard to
colony formation has shed much light on minor systematics in the Scleractinia, but when
we remember that the Rugosa are in general much less effective reef-builders, it is little
wonder that research in this line should seem less promising. That colonial forms arise from
simple ones is indisputable, yet it is often difficult to trace the origin of the colonial species
to their simple ancestors. The difficulty is increased by the fact that perhaps in more than
one case rugose corals arose from tabulate ancestors. This seems now certain in the Ordo-
vician Columnaria, and very probable in some of the Silurian Tryplasma, the Devonian
Neospongophyllum and the Carboniferous Siphonodendron.

In colonial forms, the change from fasciculate through cerioid to plocoid habit is, as
pointed out by Lang, usually very rapid, and is of little systematic value; indeed, it is
sometimes difficult to tell in which direction development is proceeding, especially between
the fasciculate and the cerioid forms.*

Change in growth-form in the hermatypic corals has perhaps a far greater range than
usually suspected. Generally speaking, growth-form in corals is essentially adaptive and
may be regarded as of no more than specific value.
