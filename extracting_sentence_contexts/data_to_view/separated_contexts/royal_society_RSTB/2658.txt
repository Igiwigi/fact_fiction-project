The majority of these, however, are forms like
Hyena, Mellivora, Gazella, amongst mammals ; Pterocles, Eupodotis, Phanicopterus,
amongst birds; Chameleon and Eryx, amongst reptiles—to quote a few well-known
examples only—and in these cases the Indian and African forms are connected by
species which inhabit South-western Asia and the Mediterranean area. Instances,
such as Golunda amongst mammals, Salpornis and Rhinoptilus amongst birds, of
genera only known in tropical Africa and India are much less common. Now it is a noteworthy fact that there are a few genera or larger groups inhabiting
India, the nearest allies of which are found, not in Africa, but in tropical America. There are several similar cases of a connection between the Eastern part of the
Indo-Malay region and the Neotropical, as in the case of the genus Tapirus, but the
most striking examples are amongst Invertebrata. Two of these may be noticed.
