as in the origin of the mid-gut epithelium. That this lack of unity is representative
of the true condition regarding the origin of this structure it is difficult to believe.
How, then, is it that the mid-gut epithelium has been derived in some insects from
the ectoderm, in others from the inner layer (endo-mesoderm), or from early
differentiated groups of cells interpreted as the true endoderm, and in still others
from yolk cells? (For detailed reviews of the various methods of the origin of the
mid-gut epithelium, vide KorscuHELt and Hemer, 1895 ; Netson, 1915 ; HirscHier,
1924, and Easruam, 1930, a, 6.) From time to time attempts have been made to
reconcile these conflicting views and bring them into line with an idea which would
be consistent with the provisions of the germ layer theory. The mid-gut epithelium
in other Arthropods and, indeed, in all other Coelomates, is a derivative of the
endoderm. Its ectodermal origin among many insects, therefore, appears anomalous
at first sight. However, the fact that actual observations warrant no other conclusion,
at least in some insects, is undisputed. To attempt to bring about a forced unity is
perhaps not the best way of solving the question.

Below are given the various modes of the origin of the mid-gut epithelium among
the Orthoptera and the Dermaptera :—

Stenobothrus variabilis (GRABER, 1891, a).
