we term A,. Exact treatment (§ 16) gives

A, = 1:0609): (44) bis

proceeding as above (from a starting assumption which satisfied (40) and made ¢”
quadratic in x”) + we obtained the estimates

1-06338, 1:062;, 1-062;, 1-062, (48)
in successive stages. This is satisfactory agreement (the error of the final estimate is

+0-15%). Table 2 summarizes the computations.

* A different expression holds at the edge (x” = 1), where (¢"),-, relates to a ‘fictitious point’
and must be adjusted to satisfy the edge condition (40).

} This assumption gave an analytic expression for A (not depending on approximate integration).
Consequently more significant figures appear in the first of (48).
