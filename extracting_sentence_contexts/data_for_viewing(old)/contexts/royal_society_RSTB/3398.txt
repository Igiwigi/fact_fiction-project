The difference between the two averages for legitimate and illegitimate stillborn

children is 9°94—almost exactly three times the difference between the averages for
legitimate and illegitimate births—in other words, these figures confirm the view
arrived at above, that the white women who submit to illegitimate union are more
apt to produce F. ova than.the married women; and this occurs in spite of the fact
that a larger proportion of the former are probably primipare.

For coloured people the same general statements are applicable, but there is an
obvious difference in degree, the excess of M. is nothing like so high as in whites.

The total average for stillborn children is 121°6 M. per 100 F., that is 21°53
higher than for births. The average for legitimate still-births is 134°31, 27°55 higher
than for legitimate births, while for illegitimate still-births the average is 11768,
that is 20°92 higher than for illegitimate births. The difference between these two
averages is 16°63, somewhat more than half as much again as the averages for
legitimate and illegitimate births show.
