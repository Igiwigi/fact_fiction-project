high exhaust without any special arrangements, and a continuous current sufhiciently

Lycopodium and sand, and apparently non-conductors in general, are not similarly affected. These
experiments were 8uggested gome years ago by Mr. Wag. F

+ A very remarkable confirmation of the theory that these molecular streams are identical in their
nature with the phenomena above described is obtained from the fact that, as PLicxer has 8hown, the
metallic deposit in the neighbourhood of the negative terminal will follow the magnetic curves if the
deposit be allowed to take place in a magnetic field, thus showing that the particles of platinum «Y :

identity of the two phenomena will be given in a subsequent portion of this paper (se page 648), but -
