The different cultures seem to be similar in other respects. Thus, almost all of them
give rise to considerable amounts of “carbon unaccounted for,” and this has been
shown to be almost entirely mannitol, both in the case of those species giving alcohol
and in the case of those which did not give it. (These results are given in Part IX.)
In addition, all the different strains grow well on the medium used, and none of them
gives rise to appreciable amounts of titratable acidity. In fact, three strains, Ac. 79,
Ac. 80 and Ac. 9, actually bring about a reduction in the initial acidity of the medium. All strains give rise to amounts of volatile acids which, while small in themselves, are
large in comparison with those formed by other groups, e.g., the A. glaucus group. Group 6.—A. versicolor-A.
