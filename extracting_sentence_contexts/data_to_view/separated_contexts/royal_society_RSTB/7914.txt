Figure 9 shows the number of plates in the anterior petal
plotted against the size of the specimen, and it should_be carefully compared with figure 7. In both cases ‘Epiaster gibbus’ tends to have more plates in the petal of the unpaired
ambulacrum than specimens of Micraster coranguinum of the same size. ‘This tendency is less
well marked, however, when the size is estimated from the compound size variate than
when it is estimated from the total length of the specimen. The fact that the Epiasters
tend to be rather larger for their length than the Micrasters will account for a part of the
increased number of plates in the anterior ambulacrum of the former seen in figure 6. It will not account for all the difference, however, and at any rate a part of this is probably
real and may have some unknown adaptive significance.

(c) The area of the sub-anal fasciole

In the analysis of the measurements of the area of the sub-anal fasciole, its area
(measurement (m), § 11d) was plotted against the length of the specimen (measurement (a))
as a scatter diagram (figure 10). Rowe’s ‘Epzaster gibbus’ and its passage forms (E32410 to
32545) were plotted as crosses, and the rest of the specimens as dots. ‘These plotted points
fall into two clearly separated groups.
