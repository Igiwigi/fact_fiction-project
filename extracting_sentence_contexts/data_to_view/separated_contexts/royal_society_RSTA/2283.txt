For although the extraneous forces required to balance the tractions
over the lateral edges are not identically zero, they are statically in equilibrium. We
may therefore superpose a system of forces in equilibrium, and equal and opposite to
these extraneous forces, to cancel them without appreciably altering the stress system,
since by Satnt-VENANT's principle (or the theory of local perturbations) the effect of a
system of forces in equilibrium acting over a small area is negligible, except at points
near that area. We can, in fact, assume that the reactions at the boundary between the materials
introduces stresses within the beam which very nearly conform to the stress system
assumed in the solution of the plate problem, except at points very near the lateral
edges. Thus the stresses in the two cases « > o’ and o < o’ may be approximately
as in (a) and (6), respectively, of fig. 5.
