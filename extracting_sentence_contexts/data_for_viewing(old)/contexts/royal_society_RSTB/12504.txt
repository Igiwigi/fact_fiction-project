(d) Odour detection, odour ratings and emotional
ratings

Following each stimulus presentation during the EEG recording,
participants indicated whether they had perceived an odour (yes,
no), and afterwards (independent of their detection statement),
their opinion on whether the putative stimulus was obtained
from women or men. Participants indicated either answer by
ticking a box on a screen (yes/no or male/female) with a
mouse (forced choice). In order not to bias the participants and
to ensure attention, participants were told that body odours
would only be presented in some, but not all trials. In fact,
odours were presented during all trails and no blank trials
were included. For odour detection as well as for the assessment
of the donors’ gender, a hit rate was calculated, defined as per-
centage of correct answers. Missing data within the detection
task were treated as ‘not detected’.

In order to obtain odour ratings, at the beginning of the
experiment, before EEG recording, each sample was presented
for 0.4 s for each of the three ratings. The order of odour presen-
tations was randomized. Participants rated the sweat samples’
intensity on a pictographic scale ranging from 1 (not at all
intense) to 9 (extremely intense). In addition, participants
