estimate of the entire arc between Clifton and Dunnose.

80 that the greatest difference is but 0”,g8. Let us suppose
it 0,4, or even oz, for the second calculation was made only
by means of the western series of triangles, and the third only
with the eastern ; but even then the error arising from un-
certainty in the elements is not half the difference we find
between the results of computation and of observations of the
fixed stars. It appears therefore, that these elements are by
no means to be neglected as a method of verification; and in
fact the quantity of 1,98 is so small, that it is extremely dif-
ficult to ascertain this quantity with the very best instruments. Of this we $hall find further proof hereafter ; but as this dis-
cussion is not without its 'use, I shall enter into some details
on this subject. The measurement in Lapland was performed by means of

a double metre, and with a repeating circle of Borpa, sent by
the National Institute of France.
