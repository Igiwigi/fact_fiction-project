nearly the proportion of 1 : 2.

The results of PUTTFARCKEN can be reconciled with mine. His analyses were per-
formed with barks imported in the dry state from South America; among these would
be both trunk- and branch-bark. The increased amounts of ash and 8mall amounts of
alkaloid in the latter would at first present the appearance of substitution, and would
mislead the investigator. I found the same, and was for some time misled also; but
a few experiments with the trunk- and branch-barks of various other trees showed me
that the latter contain more mineral bases than the former, just as in cinchona, although
no alkaloids are present. At the latter end of the foregoing Table some instances of
this are adduced,

Furthermore, the fact that the greater part of the alkaloids exists in an insoluble state
of combination in the cells of the bark, is itself 80mewhat adverse to the likelihood of
the hypothesis being true; since it is hardly likely that in this situation they can be
very active constituents of the plant.
