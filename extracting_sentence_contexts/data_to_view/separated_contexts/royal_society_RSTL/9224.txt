Since the discharges are
Snot identically the same at both terminals, the tube must contain different free charges
Sit different times.* Tt is therefore in no respect like a conductor, but is an indepen-
ent; electrical system, holding much the same position as the air-vessel in a forcing-
Epump. All the electricity that comes into it goes out again, but the truth of this can
Epnly be asserted when we consider the whole discharge from the beginning to the end,
S nd it may nob be even approximately true during a small finite time.
= This independence of the discharges from the two terminals is a most important fact
Sn the analysis of the mode of passage of electricity through rarefied gases. It
[empatcs the error of seeking analogies in metallic conduction ; and shows that any
Dppearance of obedience to regular laws as to change of potential as we proceed along
She tube, resistance, &c., must arise from the fact that the effects measured are really
Sverage effects over a space of time enormously long compared with the duration of

= * In order to show this conclusively, a vacuum tube was enclosed in a metal canister (bhe wires passing
its terminals through tubes of insnlating material inserted in small holes in the canister) and a telephone
-Swas placed in cirenit between the canister and the earth. When a discharge with an air-spark in the
xternal circuit was sent through the tube a sonnd was heard in the telephone similar to that made by the
Shir-spark. By a fundamental proposition in electricity the free electricity on the surface of the canister
Land which escaped through the telephone to the earth) was ab any instant equal to the excess of one
Skind of electricity over the other in the space within the canister.
