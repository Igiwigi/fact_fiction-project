ScuwanN, © that the same peculiarity *** is found in the true mucus-corpuscles,
present in healthy mucus+.” Respecting pus-corpuscles, Scawanx remarks, © They
share with them [corpuscles of mucus] the peculiar relation towards acetic acid.”

96. My own observations on this subject are the following. In Plate XX. fig.
64 . are pus-globules, to which no addition whatever had been made ; and fig. 63 7
presents one of these globules, as viewed after the addition of dilute spirit. Now as
the objects in both figures exhibit the division of the © nucleus,” just spoken of,
without the addition of acetic acid, I am compelled to form an opinion opposed to
that of the authors just referred to, and to maintain that in the pus-globule acetic
acid is not required to produce such division.

97. But facts recorded in several of my former memoirs appear to have been suffi-
cient for showing that neither acetic acid nor any other foreign substance is required
to produce division of what has been called the nuclens of the pus-globule ; snch
division being part of the process by which cells are reproduced, and apparently
uniyersal in its operation. 'The present memoir, also, will be found full of facts,
showing that this really is the case.

98. As to the mode of origin of the objects in question, ScuwanN remarks, © The
pus-corpuscles are thus probably peculiar cells, forming in the pus-serum, that is in
the eytoblastema, which in inflammation exudes in greater quantity and unusual
mixture, in the same manner as the mucus-corpuscles form in mucus, and as all cells
