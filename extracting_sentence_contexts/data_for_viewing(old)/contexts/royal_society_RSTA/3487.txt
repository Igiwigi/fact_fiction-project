microstructural observations, provide important insights into the role of material heterogeneity
and anisotropy on the fragmentation process under compressive loading. The data spread, and
resulting nonlinear character of the SSA versus r~! relationship for AN, particularly in the
inverse particle size range of 10mm7! <r~! <30mm_"! (figure 6a), is likely a product of the
adherence of abundant submicrometre-sized particles to larger particles (figure 7d,f). Conversely,
the nonlinearity in the SSA versus r~! relationship in WG is characterized by a non-intuitive

decrease in SSA with increasing r~! in the range 0mm! <r~! <5mm_â„¢! before increasing with
r~! (ie. with decreasing particle size). It is noteworthy that the average grain diameter of 0.75mm : =
in WG (r-!~2.7mm"!) roughly delineates the change in dependence. The pervasive failure : =
along cleavage planes in micas and feldspars (figure 8b,e,f) exposes new surfaces, whereas this :3
effect is probably undersampled at successively smaller grain size fractions (increasing r~!) up : =
to the average grain size of the rock. This interpretation is supported by the fact that this trend D8
is repeated for hand-crushed WG samples where shearing along cleavage planes is especially : oy
pervasive (figure 8f). Furthermore, the relatively high SSA measurements in the smallest size : 2
fraction from hand-ground specimens may be explained by a more finely skewed PSD within 1
this size fraction bin (figure 8b), which is perhaps dominantly generated by the strong activation : s
S

of shear deformation (figure 8f) driven by the grinding motion, but facilitated by the natural
strength anisotropy of biotite and feldspar minerals. Such shear motion could enhance particle
size reduction by wear and localized deformation at the tips of shear cracks, and no such
pervasive evidence of shear deformation was observed in either the dynamically fragmented or
hand-crushed AN samples.
