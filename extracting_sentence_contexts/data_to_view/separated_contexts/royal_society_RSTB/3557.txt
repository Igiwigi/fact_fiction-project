This chromophilous substance, though present in the general
cytoplasm, is nowhere found in such dense accumulations as in the perinuclear zone
with which the perinuclear network is so intimately associated. It would appear,
therefore, that this central network is specially situated with regard to the facility
for rapid nutrition and for experiencing the full benefit of its close proximity to the
nucleus. Some of the nerve elements described by Berne seem to afford ground for
accepting his view that the cell body in these cases may be regarded as being of
subsidiary importance, as, in fact, a lateral, perhaps merely trophic, appendage of the
conducting elements or fibres. But whatever may be the relative value of the cell
body and its processes in the case of certain crustacean nerve cells, I think no one,
after examining the giant cells of Halla and noting their large size and the high
degree of development of the neurofibrillar network and especially of the perinuclear
