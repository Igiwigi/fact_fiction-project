tube foot and its associated ampulla, as revealed by intra-vitam staining methods. It 1
hoped, in further communications, to present an analysis of the co-ordinated and unco
ordinated activities of the feet in which opportunity will be taken to check and to extenc
some of the results of this anatomical study.

METHODS

It has been shown (Smith 1937) that much of the gross morphology of the asteroi
nervous system may be revealed by the use of polychrome stains such as Mallory’s tripl
stain on sections of Bouin, Heidenhain’s ‘Susa’ or Flemming (F.w.A.) fixed material, bu
it was pointed out at the same time that a more precise delineation of the tracts woul
probably be obtained if an intra-vitam staining method, suited to echinoderm material
could be found. This has in fact proved to be the case. The method which has so far give!
the best results is that which McConnell (1932) used in demonstrating the nerve net o
Hydra and which was originally developed by Unna (1911, 1916).

It has been my practice to make and use the stain in the following manner. To 20 c.c
of 0:5 % methylene blue (Gribler) made up in distilled water was added 1 drop o
concentrated hydrochloric acid (A.R.). After stirring the solution for about a minute, 2 c.c
of 12 % rongalitweiss in distilled water were introduced. On heating this mixture genth
until it steams, the methylene blue is reduced to its leucobase; the reaction, once started
is quite rapid, the blue solution changing first to an apple-green colour and then to ;
colourless fluid in which is suspended a yellow precipitate. After filtering, the solutio:
was set aside overnight in a test-tube plugged with cotton-wool.
