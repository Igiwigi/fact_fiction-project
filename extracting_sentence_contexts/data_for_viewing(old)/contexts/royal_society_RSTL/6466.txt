certain, that independently of the mere spply of constituents, the conditions of concen.
tration, and digestibility, and consequently of assimilavility of our different foods, mugt
have their share in determining the relative values for the varying exigencies of the
system, of substances which, in a more general, or-more purely chemical sense, may 8till
justly be looked upon as mutually replaceable. It would, indeed, hardly be SUPPoxed,
that swbstances s0 distinct, both morphologically and chemically, as Fat and Starch, will,
under all circumstances, be equally adapted to the conditions supplied within the living
organism, and be 80 at an equal cost to its energies;—even though they may each even.
tually subserve the Fat-storing and respiratory requirements of the body.

It is, then, fully granted, that in the study of this branch of Physiological Chemistry,
as in that of others, the facts peculiar to Physiology herself must be allowed an important
place ; though, it is at the same time claimed, that those of Chemzstry be not excluded,
By the aid of Chemistry it may be established—that, in the admixture of Animal food
with Bread, the relation, in estimated respiratory and fat-forming capacity, of the non-
nitrogenous to the Nitrogenous substance, will be increased ; and further—that, in sweh
a mixed diet, the proportion of the non-nitrogenous constituents which will be in the
concentrated condition, 80 to speak, of fat itself, will be considerably greater than in Bread
alone. Common experience testifies, moreover, that certain advantages are 80 derived.
It is for Physiology to lend her aid to the full explanation of the facts and conclusions
which Chemistry and common usage may in their turn determine.
