These nerve-cells are therefore larger than those of the corresponding series in the
upper limbic are (vide table of measurements), also larger than those of the lower
limbic arc, which average for the olfactory gyrus 25p X 13p ; for the gyrus hippocampi
31uX13p; and for the modified olfactory type near the occipital pole 23pX 13p.
Larger cells occur occasionally, scattered widely apart, the largest registered attaining
the dimensions of 60p Xx 18k. If these average dimensions be contrasted with those
of the second cortical layer, in the region of the modified olfactory type (Plate 50,
fig. 6, B), the important fact is disclosed that this peculiar formation consists of cells
which attain a much higher average than that of the ganglionic cells. These globose
inflated cells usually average 37 X 32p, and frequently reach the dimensions of
46k X27p. These are therefore the largest nervous elements to be found throughout
the cortex cerebri. The lower limb of the rich ganglionic tract extending from the
frontal pole along the limbic fizsure beyond the Sylvian depression, possesses cells of
a 8maller 8ize than those of the corresponding upper tract. Thus in front of the
corpus callosum the nerve-cells near the limbic fissure measure 27p X 17p, as contrasted
with 32k X 16p for those of the upper tract ; "behind the Sylvian depression those
of the lower tract measure 27Ã¾ X17, whilsb those of the upper track measure
34pX17p.
