including Hadamard himself, have reported a similar introspection.

This view, however, has been highly debated and disagrees with an influential
view in cognitive science that considers mathematics as an offshoot of the human
capacity for language. According to Noam Chomsky, ‘the origin of the mathema-
tical capacity [lies in] an abstraction from linguistic operations’ [2]. Indeed,
although mathematics call upon a dedicated inventory of symbols and words,
both natural language and mathematics share the need for a recursion operation
that creates embedded tree structures [3]. Furthermore, some mathematical con-
cepts seem to be language-dependent, for instance exact arithmetic facts may

learned multiplication tables, which are learned by rote, put a
greater emphasis on language areas than subtraction, which
requires quantity manipulations [6,7].

In summary, the relationships between mathematical
