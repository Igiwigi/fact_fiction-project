the extreme accuracy required, that an error of figure amounting to but a small
fraction of a hair's hreadth would destroy the action of a speculum, it is scarcely
to be expected that any process can succeed in practice, which has not, like that of
grinding, a decided tendency to correct its own defects, and to produce a result in
which the errors may be said to be infinitely small in comparison with the errors in

any of the previous steps from which it was derived. I need, perhaps, therefore hardly
say that all my experiments have been directed to the one object, that of endeavour-
ing to improve the common published process of grinding and polishing, particularly
in its application to large surfaces; for although the accuracy usually attained is 80
great that we fail in detecting by mechanical means, among a variety of specula made
at different times and by different persons, any deviation from the proper figure, 8till
by optical means, in fact, by trial in a telescope, the defects are at once apparent ; and
we shall probably find among them examples of every grade of defining power, from
the speculum which is almost perfect, to that which does not define at all. This dif-
