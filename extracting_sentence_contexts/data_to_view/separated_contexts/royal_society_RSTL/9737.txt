of the nitrogen of
ammonia-salts, or of nitrate of 8o0da, is estimated to be recovered when these were
employed in conjunction with an annual supply of soluble artificial mineral manures,

There is thus, here, further evidence of the much less effect of a given amount of
nitrogen supplied in farmyard manure than as ammonia-salts. Tt is also clear that,
although the application of the ammonia-salts was the means of turning to account
some of the accumulated residue of the mineral constituents supplied in the dung, the
limit of the immediately available supply was very s00n reached, the remainder be-
coming less and less rapidly recoverable. It was, in fact, retained in a condition 80
slowly available as to be of but little effect in increasing immediate crops, and therefore
of but little practical value, except as a storehouse against exhaustion. Tue SrconND CRoPs. So far, the produce of the first crops only, of each year, has been taken into account.
