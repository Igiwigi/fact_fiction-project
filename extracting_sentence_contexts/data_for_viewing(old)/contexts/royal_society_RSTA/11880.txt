changed to about 8° with the original monoclinic axis. As the extinction orientation of
the supposed octahedra is unknown, and the crystals are too small to observe singly,
no further conclusion can be obtained.

We desire to express our thanks to Professor Davip for the foregoing valuable
addition to our knowledge of the structure of this film. It clearly consists either
of a form of sulphur intermediate between monoclinic and rhombic sulphur with
extinction angles of 8° or 9°, and which still preserves the melting-point of prismatic
sulphur, or, on the other hand, it may perhaps turn out that the octahedra formed
in this way are merely very unstable and return to the monoclinic state so rapidly
that in melting-point experiments the reconversion always occurs before the melting
can take place. Aged monoclinic crystals of sulphur from various sources were
found to behave in the same way. Against the instability theory we have the fact
that the melting-point was the same, whatever the initial temperature of the glycerine
bath. During the electrical observations the film was probably partly normal mono-
clinic and partly “‘aged” monoclinic.

No quartz rods were used to reduce the surface conduction. The film was dried
for some days in position in the oil bath by sulphuric acid and phosphorus pentoxide.

The colour of the sulphur was a pure lemon-yellow.
