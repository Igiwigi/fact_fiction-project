At the same time the fibre decreases very considerably in diameter, and the cause of
this is sufficiently obvious. As the nuclei part from each other and as the spaces
between them increase, the bands which they separated fall in, â€”approach each other
and ultimately coalesce*. This fact is placed beyond doubt by the examination of
some fibres in which these changes are in progress, Plate X. fig. 8. At one extre-
mity of a fibre may be seen the oval nuclei packed closely together, and bordered at
their extremities by the substance of the fibre; further on they may be seen sepa-
rating and becoming rounder, the bands at the same time are beginning to approxi-

* For example, in a specimen of muscular tissue from a fetal pig 34 inches long three fibres were measured. In the first the nuclei were almost in contact, and the width of the fibre was 357th of an inch; in the econ
the nuelei were 557th of an inch apart, and the width of the fibre was 544;7; in the third the nuclei were
Tegpth of an inch apart, and the width of the fibre was 5755.
