be little better than conjecture, since there is nothing in the structure of the parts to
lead to any definite conclusion ; but there are one or two points which may be
noted as peculiar.

The organ is situated not far from the mouth, and is directed downwards. It ap--
pears to be supplied by a separate nerve sent off from the supra-cesophageal ganglion,
and I have ascertained, by repeated experiments, that it is the most sensitive part of
the body ; since, while the mechanical irritation of any other parts excited only a
slight movement in the limbs of the animal, when out of water, and somewhat feeble,
the touching of this part was immediately followed by a violent and almost spasmodic
flapping of the tail. These circumstances, together with the situation of the organ,
appear to point it out as intended possi√æbly for the purpose of testing the quality of
the food; as in fact an organ of smell, evidently endowed with an exquisite sensi-
bility ; but in the absence of other analogies I would be understood as offering this
rather as a conjecture, subject to correction by further examination and experiment.
I may add, that I have not observed this organ in any other than the two species
Jjust noticed.

But it is to the true organ of hearing that I would more particularly direct atten-
tion. This remarkable organ is situated in the base or first joint of the lesser pair
of antennze, the joint being slightly dilated at its base, PI. IX. fig. 2. a.

Its precise seat is indicated externally by a tongh membrane, covering an oval
aperture in the upper surface of this joint, PI. IX. fig. 2.b. The membrane appears
to be a continuation of the same structure which forms the shell, but in which the
