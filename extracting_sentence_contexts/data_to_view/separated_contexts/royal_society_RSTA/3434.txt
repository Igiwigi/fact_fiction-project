We remark that incompatibility of these
observables does not prevent the possibility of determination of so-to-say hidden variables, the
position of the firefly in the box given by the Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z). However, to determine
these coordinates we need more windows. In fact, construction of such a net of windows may
destroy the box (and, in any event, change the behaviour of this firefly). This situation is similar
to an attempt to construct a complete picture of a water aquifer or an oil reservoir by drilling a
dense net of wells, cf. the discussion in ยง2. In this comparison, wells play the role of windows for
the firefly box.
