number, agreeing with previous work [31,32]. This is interest-
ing, as the Fourier transforms show that the connected
patterns contain more energy at high spatial frequencies
which, according to the influential model of Dakin et al. [7],
should lead to an increase, rather than a decrease in perceived
numerosity. However, when we measured the apparent
numerosities of higher densities, the effect was reduced,
being only 15% with of 100 dots (3.3 dots degâ€™).

We also asked subjects to judge the density of the patterns.
At low densities, the connected patterns seemed about 25%

less dense, despite the fact that they were in fact more dense,
as they have more patterning within the same area. However,
at higher densities, the results inverted, with the connected
patterns appearing to be denser, corresponding to the physical
reality. Thus, at modest densities, it would seem that perceived
density was driven by perceived numerosity, rather than the
other way round, in agreement with other work [37]. At
high densities, on the other hand, perception corresponds
much more closely to physical reality.

Other evidence reinforces the idea of different regimes for
numerosity and density perception at different stimulus den-
sities. For example, Dakin et al. [7] have shown that stimuli
