powers are enfeebled.

When otherwise morbid, it occasions other forms of disease, as the conyul-
sion, the croup-like respiration, the affection of the sphincters, observed in
dentition, the various effects of intestinal irritation, &c.

The effects of the excited reflex function are sometimes observed in a part
near that irritated, as in the eyelids in winking, in the glottis on inhaling a
drop of water or particle of food, in the sphincter ani in dysentery, &c. ; s0me-
times in parts remote, as in the irritation of teething when this induces strabis-
mus, conyulsion, the croup-like respiration, relaxed sphincters, &c.

However some of the facts detailed in this paper may have been previously
known,—and many were 80 known ,—they have never been accurately distin-
guished from sensation and volition, and associated with a peculiar reflex fuane-
tion of the medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis, influencing other organs
besides the limbs, and constituting the principle of tone and of a particular
series of actions. It has long been known, for example, that the limbs of a de-
capitated animal moved on being stimulated; but the phenomenon was con-
founded with sensation and voluntary motion. It has long been known that
carbonic acid could not be inhaled through the larynx ; but it has not been
shown that this phenomenon depends upon the presiding ageney of the me-
qdulla oblongata; nor has it been distinctly demonstrated that the functions of
the sphincter ani, by which the intestinal excretions are retained for a time, is
constantly dependent upon a similar agency of the lower part of the medulla
