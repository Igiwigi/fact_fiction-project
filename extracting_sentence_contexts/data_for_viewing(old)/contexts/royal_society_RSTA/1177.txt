either Earth and Venus or Earth and Mars.

While at both of these radial distances it is clear that the two planets formed beyond the water
and the CO) ice lines, 30 AU is closer to the nominal CO ice line (e.g. Oberg et al. [26]). A difference
of 10 AU could lead to substantial differences in the heavy element enrichments of the planets
(see Mousis et al. [27] and references therein). In addition, since the solid-surface densities at the
two locations is different, the planetary growth history is also expected to differ (e.g. Helled &
Bodenheimer [28]).

It is possible that Uranus and Neptune formed much closer to the Sun, and even switched
positions! (e.g. Thommes et al. [29]; Tsiganis et al. [30]). This can partially resolve the formation

more massive than Uranus.


time scale problem of Uranus and Neptune (e.g. Helled & Bodenheimer [28]). However,
a calculation that includes the planetary growth, accounting for the heavy-elements self-
consistently, and that can lead to the predicted Hâ€”-He-to-heavy elements ratios of either planet
is still missing.

(c) Axis tilt and Satellite systems

A distinct feature of Uranus is its axial tilt. This has typically been thought to be a result of a giant
impact [24,31-36] although the tilt could also be a result of a spin-orbit resonance [37-39]. Giant
