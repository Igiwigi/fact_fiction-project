the X®% strain which is furnished with both the M and N radicle, this is in fact what
should be expected.

It has been shown that the resultant effect on the host plant of a mixture of two
strains, one of greater and one of lesser virulence, is not a summation of virulences but a
dilution effect, and if this happens when the radicles are in different molecules it is not
unreasonable to suppose that it should happen when both are situated on the same
molecule.

It is, of course, equally possible to regard the difference between X° and X% as
quantitative rather than qualitative. Thus if X¥ is possessed of an M radicle with a
virulence value of, say 10, rather than 5 attributed to X%, and further if this particular
type of M radicle is more stable than those of lower value, then the fact that X” does
not mutate in tobacco cultures would be explained. On the other hand, there is good
reason to believe that X¥, when present in certain potato varieties (pp. 160 and 163),
does undergo change and under such conditions it would be necessary to assume that
its high value M radicle mutated to ones of lower value. If, however, there be no M
radicle present in X”, then such mutation would presumably be consequent on the
breakdown of the radicle N to a low M form, which leads to the conclusion that there
is no essential difference between the two views.

A comparison of the two strains X? and X% presents an interesting problem. On the
potato both have a clear-cut and similar destructively necrotic effect; on tobacco the
former is indistinguishable from X¢, whilst the latter is severely necrotic in its action
and resembles X%. We can explain this by assuming that the X? differs from the X¢
