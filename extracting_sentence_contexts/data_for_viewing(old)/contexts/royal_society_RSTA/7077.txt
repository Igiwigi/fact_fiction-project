first. It will be understood that the sets of equations are solved in order of z increasing, so
that in the solution of the equations for the function of any order n, the functions of order

x j<nare known.
S The equations (8-23), (9:1), (9:2) have properties similar to the three properties (§ 17 (i)
8 to (iii)) of the equations for the null-order functions, namely:

(i) the equation for f/ involves only h,, 7, and known functions;
‘& ~—(ii)_ the equation for I is linear in A‘, and does not involve r;;

(iii) the equation for rf is linear in 7,.

= The fact that the system of equations as a whole is linear in f,, 7, 4, is not important at this
a stage. These three properties enable a procedure very like that of §17 to be used, with
5 similar consequences, that the aggregate errors of the results are O(d7)? and that this accuracy
®& is obtained without successive approximation or estimation.
