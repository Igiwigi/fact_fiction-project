transfer learned behaviours through cell fusion [93]. The
notion of ‘proto-brains’ formed by individual bacterial or
amoeboid cells is something that was unthinkable until very
recently. Slime moulds are currently studied in terms of their
‘proto-cognitive’ abilities [94-96].

In summary, the fact is that certain types of social bacteria
seem capable of performing some of the currently accepted
brain functions. Examples of these are the perception of
environmental signals and their analysis and interpretation
(particularly when related to nutrients), as well as the coordi-
nation between individuals in order to acquire such nutrients.
Also, eukaryotes like slime moulds are able to perform the
aforementioned activities and they take it one step further,
namely by engaging in learning and memory processes and
on the generation of true division of labour, including the
apparent sacrifice of certain individuals for the sake of the
community and even the loss of individual cellular identity
