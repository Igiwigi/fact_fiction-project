the supposition of an equilibrium, that the forces in action must be without effect to
cause pressure either way in any canal, as P Ã¾ or P c, within a level surface.


OF A HOMOGENEOUS FLUID AT LIBERTY. 247

2. Some years before the publication of the Principia, it had been ascertained by
observation that the same mass of matter has not the same weight at all the points
of the earth's surface. A pendulum clock regulated by mean time at Paris was found
by M. Ricnes to lose two minutes a day at Cayenne, within 5* of the equator. Now
the length of a pendulum that oscillates in a given time is an exact measure of gravity;
and the fact observed by M. Rricnzs proved that, if a heavy body were carried from
Paris to Cayenne, it would lose some part of its weight. On learning this fact,
HuvyGnexs conjectured that it was caused by the centrifugal force arising from the
daily revolution of the earth ; the intensity of this force varying in different latitudes
at different distances from the axis of rotation. Combining this obseryed variation
of gravity with a principle, which is indisputably true, namely, that a plumb-line
freely snspended is perpendicular to the surface of standing water, or to the surface
of the earth supposed entirely fluid, he drew an argument, that the earth is not ex-
actly spherical. Were the earth a perfect sphere, the attraction of its mass would be
perpendicular to the surface at eyery point : the centrifugal force, directed at right
angles from the axis of rotation, is oblique to the surface: wherefore gravity, being
the resultant of both forces, and consequently not coinciding in its direction with
either, would not be perpendicular to the surface, which is contrary to the admitted
principle. It will readily appear that the resultant of the two forces, or the true di-
