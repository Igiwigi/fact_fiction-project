exposed to low levels of ALAN (approx. 15 lux; [56]), and
light intensities as low as 0.03 lux have been shown to inhibit
hatching of sergeant major, Abudefduf saxatilis, embryos [55].
For fish larvae that do hatch and survive the pelagic larval
period, recruitment back to coral reef habitat is also often
synced to the lunar cycle. In fact, on coral reefs, most organisms
settle disproportionately on the new moonâ€”under cover of
darkness [53,57,58]. Darkness during the new moon hinders
the hunting ability of many reef-based predators [52,59], and
triggers the emergence of demersal zooplankton [60], a poten-
tial prey resource for settling larva. Therefore, the intensity of
light present at night can facilitate or hinder offspring survival
at this vulnerable stage, through modifying predation pressure
and feeding opportunities upon return to the reef, however,
currently no studies have assessed how ALAN interferes
with settlement and subsequent recruitment of reef fishes
