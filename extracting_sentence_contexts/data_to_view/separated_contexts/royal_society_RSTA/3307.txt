The above-mentioned ‘linear-like’ function
representations are given as [2]

Y(é,¢) =F? et) + s, (3.7)

(6,6) =F * Meo (3.9)
and WE) =F el - Hs, (3.10)

where kj = 2xj/d (for j € Z), 6(€,0) = ®(E), W(E,0) = WE) and

~ 1 ph/2 _
m=7] Was. Here, L is the wavelength in the canonical domain. We have used the Cauchy—Riemann relations
and the fact that

Xp =1-C[Y¢]. (3.11)


The integral (Hilbert-like) operator C[-]:= Ffi coth(kjD)]F;[-] acts on the function’s respective
harmonic conjugate [2]. The boundary value of the velocity potential’s harmonic conjugate w is

~ ~ ~{Y
W=cY+yY (3 + ) . (3.12)

Through the relation ge = We it follows that along the (canonical) free surface ikF,[®] =
kj coth(kD)F,.[¥] and therefore  =—C[W]. This relation allows us to compute @ from the free
surface Y.
