Here W(s,) should be replaced by Gs?!Â° if we are dealing with the growth of spherical particles.

Thus, the problem on the dynamics of a polydisperse ensemble of ellipsoidal and spherical
particles with fluctuations in crystal growth rates is analytically solved in a parametric form. The
solution dependent on the parameter x1 is given by expressions (4.7), (4.13), (4.16)-(4.18).

The behaviour of these solutions is shown in figures 8-10. The parametric dependencies of the
liquid supercooling w and dimensionless time t on the modified time xj are illustrated in figure 8.
Since the growth of modified time x; means the growth of real time t, supercooling decreases with
increasing x;. Let us especially note that the dependence of supercooling for ellipsoidal crystals is
higher than for spherical crystals in parametric space. In fact, these dependencies change places
(figure 10b).

The crystal-volume distribution function calculated accordingly to expression (4.13) at
different modified times x, is demonstrated in figure 9. As is easily seen, the distribution function
represents a truncated bell-shaped curve, which moves to the right (to larger volumes of crystals)
as time x1 increases. As this takes place, the distribution function becomes wider and lower. This
