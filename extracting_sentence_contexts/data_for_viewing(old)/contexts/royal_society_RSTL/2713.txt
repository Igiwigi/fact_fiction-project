y It will appear from the references in the following paper how each of the various facts, dispersed through
p51] 50 many publications, has contributed to fill up the great outline of the laws that regulate the animal fune-
© tions, which has been the object of my labours, and from which the topics of the day have never induced me to
5 swerve. It is evident that this outline must be ascertained, before the functions of particular organs can be
© uccessfully investigated ; all of which more or less depend on the general laws of our frame.

The following I believe is the first attempt which has been made to ascertain experimentally the seat, the
functions and the nature of all the powers of the more perfect animal, and the various relations they bear to
each other, by which, several and in some functions all of these powers being enabled to cooperate, their more
complicated results are effected. In the latter part of the subject, I have found much care required in ren-
dering the language sufficiently explicit; and if in any instance I have failed in this attempt, I hope it will in
ome degree be ascribed to the yery complicated nature of the subject, arising from the great variety of facts
on which the conclusions are necessarily founded,

It will be admitted with respect to the conclusions themselves, that the cireumstance of the present inquiry
embracing the whole of the subject is in favour of their accuracy ; because in that case, and where, as in the
present instance, all the parts are intimately connected, few inferences consequently resting on any single
position, an error may betray itself in «0 many ways, that it can hardly escape detection.
