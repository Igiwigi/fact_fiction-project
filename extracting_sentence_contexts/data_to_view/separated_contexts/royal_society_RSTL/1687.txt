Mr. Cov-
LoMB inferred from some comparative experiments on small
specimens, that the state of temper does not alter the elastic
force of steel ; and your Experiments on Vibration led to
the same conclusion (Nat, Philos. IT. 403). But the subject
appeared to require further investigation, and particularly
because it afforded an opportunity of ascertaining some other
facts respecting steel, which had not been before examined. In making the experiments which I am about to describe,
each bar was supported at its ends by two blocks of cast
iron. These blocks rested upon a strong wooden frame.
