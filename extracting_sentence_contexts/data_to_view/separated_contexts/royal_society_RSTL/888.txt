It musr be evident that nothing very decisive respecting the
general ellipticity of the Meridian can be deduced from the
present experiments. For this purpose it is requisite that the
extreme stations should comprise an arc of sufficient length
to render the effect of irregular attraction insensible ; and this
effect might be diminished, if not wholly prevented, by select-
ing tations of similar geological character, and which should
differ as little as possible in elevation above the level of the sea. If however some deduction be made for the superior den-
sity which it has been remarked exists at Portsoy, the com-
pression 35> deduced from that station and Unst, may perhaps
be considered as not far distant from the truth, both being
Situated on rocks of a similar nature; Unst consisting chiefly
of serpentine, and Portsoy, of serpentine, slate, and granite ;
and as 4; the ellipticity given by the experiments at Unst
and Arbury Hill, is nearly the same as that resulting from
Unst and Portsoy, it would be no improbable conjecture that
the sudden' increase of gravitation observed at Arbury Hill,
may be occasioned by a rock of primitive formation, approach-
ing the surface of the earth in the vicinity of that station.*

These facts appear sufficient to explain the anomalies which

Â®* Since the above was written, I find the conjecture I have hazarded remarkably
supported by fact; for on consulting Su1TH's Geological Map of England, it appears
that Mount Sorrel, a mass of granite, is situated, together with other rocks of primitive
formation, about 3o miles to the north of Arbury Hill,

426 Capt. Kate's experiments for determining the variation

have been remarked in the Trigonometrical Suryey of Great
Britain, For if the; disturbing force in; the, neighbourhood
of Arbury Hill, were supposed to be situated: to. thenorth of
that tation, the. plumb line would be attracted northward,
the observed latitude would be less than the /true, and the.
length of the degree deduced from the arc between Dunnose
and Arbury would be in excess, and that derived from the
arc between Clifton and Arbury in defect... This last error
will be augmented, if we suppose the attraction of the matter
near Arbury Hill to be felt at Clifton, and the plumbil line at that
station to be drawn towards the, South,
