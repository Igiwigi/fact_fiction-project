visible only at the basal part ; the electrometer indicated negativity of the contracting
portion. If, with one leading-off electrode applied to an indifferent part, the other
leading-off electrode was shifted to a distance from the actually contracting portion,
the excursion was quickly lessened and lost; if it was shifted to the auricle, the
N variation of a ventricular rhythm gave way to the much more frequent variation
n of auricular rhythm,

Nothing can be clearer than these effects of injury at base and apex respectively.
The diphasic variation SN (viz., apex negativity followed by base negativity) is,
in consequence of injury of the apex, converted into the monophasic variation N
(unbalanced negativity of base). After a time the diphasic variation SN re-appears,
and now it is converted into the monophasic variation S (unbalanced negativity of
apex) in consequence of injury of the apex. These facts, illustrated in fig. 1, are
precisely similar to those observed by Burpon SanpErson and Pacer * upon the
ventricle of the Frog and Tortoise, the only difference being in the nature of the
normal variation antecedent to injury.
