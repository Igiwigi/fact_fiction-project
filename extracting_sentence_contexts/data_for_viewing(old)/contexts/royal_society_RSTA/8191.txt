practically defined limit of perfect (statical) elasticity. From this determination of
¥ (@), and assuming ¢() = ¥ (@), BourzMann calculated a value of the logarithmic
decrement of a torsional pendulum. The observed logarithmic decrement was about
50 per cent. greater than the calculated, a difference too large to be explained by air
resistance ; and the calculated value would already appear to be too large on account

of the assumption p= | ¥()do.  Bourzmann’s theory predicted that the

logarithmic decrement of the amplitude of vibration of a torsional pendulum would
be constant and independent of the period of vibration, a result which does not appear
to be true.t The fact that the principle of superposition is not verified by experiments
on elastic afterworkingt is also a serious criticism of the theory. The differential
equations of motion of the theory of elasticity become integro-differential equations
with BotrzMaNn’s modifications of Hooxr’s law, and VoirerrRa§ has developed the
resulting mathematical theory in several papers.
