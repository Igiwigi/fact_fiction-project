Whereas the anlage of
the circle of Willis is recognizable at the twenty-nine somite stage, and all the arteries
of the brain can be recognized at seven and a half days of incubation, considerable
progress still remains to be made in the development of the head sinuses at the
nine day stage. ;

The first encephalic artery to be differentiated is the bigeminal, which can perhaps
be correlated with the precocious development of the optic lobes in birds. In Miss
Sasrn’s drawing one of the twenty-nine somite stage, reproduced here as fig. 1,
Plate 1, the plexus over the anlage of the optic lobes can be seen to be concentrating
into a vessel running up towards the dorsal surface of the mid-brain. In a thirty-
two somite embryo, this vessel can be recognized still more clearly, b7.a., fig. 4,
Plate 2, due in part to the fact that the injection mass has not lodged in the finer
meshes of the fore- and mid-brain plexus. This vessel is the bigeminal artery. As
in Miss SaBrn’s twenty-nine somite embryo, the plexus growing back over the hind-
brain has anastomosed with the first five intersomitic arteries.
