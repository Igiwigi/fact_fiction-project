Bunkov also discussed the intriguing phenomenon of BEC of magnons in
superfluid * *He. The concept of BECs normally applies to systems with a conserved
particle number, but can also apply to sufficiently long-lived quasiparticles, such
as magnons. In fact, this intriguing phenomenon is closely analogous to BEC in
diffuse atomic gases, but in some respects richer: especially noteworthy is the
existence of several distinct condensed states of magnons, including stationary
spin waves and homogeneously precessing domains. In particle physics models of the early Universe, based on fundamental
(super)string theory, an important role is played by ‘branes’, effectively higher
dimensional defects. One popular idea, discussed further below, is that of a brane
world in which our observable Universe is confined to a 3-brane, a three-
dimensional surface in the higher dimensional space required by string theory.
