Similar work has been undertaken for
M. rhesus, which I have already described for S. entellus (No. 8). A large series of
specimens have been examined in the form of serial sections, and the various
phenomena compared, step by step, with those exhibited by my preparations of the
menstruating uteri of S. entellus, and a close similarity between the two has been
found to exist. While it has been thought advisable to note the points of agreement
and difference, which are brought out by an examination of the process of menstruation
in these two species of monkeys, and to point out the fact that the results arrived at
by the study of M. rhesus, entirely contirm the results which my examination of
S. entellus led me to publish, I have purposely avoided all unnecessary repetition, and
have been obliged, in consequence, to assume some knowledge of the details given in
Part I. of this paper (No. 8). The advisability for this course has seemed to be the more pronounced since the
results which I have arrived at differ, in various important particulars, from the
accounts of menstruation which have been generally accepted, and a confirmation of
the former has therefore some increased interest and importance. With regard to the body of the uterus, I have only here to record the fact that the
