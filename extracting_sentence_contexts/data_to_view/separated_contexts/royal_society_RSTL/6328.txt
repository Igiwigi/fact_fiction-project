From the whole of the foregoing considerations bearing upon the relation of the
stituents of increase to those of the food consumed to produce it, it appears, that a lay
proportion of the Fat, of which the increase of the 80-called fattening animals 80 '
consists, may be formed in the body from other compounds of the food. Of the nitrg-
genous compounds, on the other hand, it is probable that frequently as little, and even
less than 5 per cent. of the whole consumed, will be found finally stored up in the
increase of the animal. Of the mineral matter of the food, a less proportion still than
of the nitrogenous compounds, will, especially in the case of Pigs, be thus retained in the
increase. 4

It is not the province of the present Paper, nor are the facts applicable to such a pur-
pose, to consider the chemical and physiological changes undergone, or the offices 8ub-
served, by the—say 95 per cent. of the consumed nitrogenous compounds in their pasage
through the system. But, it may be remarked, that from the form in which a large
proportion of them leaves the body, it is to be concluded that they must have entered
into its fluids, if not its solid structures, and therein been subjected to oxidation and trans
formation. That this must serve some essential purpose, even in the processes of fate
tening animals subject to little muscular movement, there cannot be a doubt*.
