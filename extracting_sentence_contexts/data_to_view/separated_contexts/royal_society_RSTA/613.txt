To overcome this problem, we have (i) reduced the volume of the temperature sensor
effectively sensed by confining the evaluated frequency range and (ii) derived the corresponding

mean conductivity from a fit, which minimizes the variance of )°, Tii(fk). In detail, we perform
the fit
Re[Sy if, Vi, Vi]
var Tij(fk,@) ) > min, Ti(f, a) = Cal ij - - (4.3)
(x iff ) iGO = Coal SREB pi (f/er oR

based on (arbitrary) oper and obtain the fit result of, = aft - TRe¢- The confined frequency range
420-3600 Hz used for evaluation corresponds to skin depths 5 = 1/,/x fo between 0.32 mm and
0.11 mm. The fit procedure benefits from the fact that the evaluated frequencies are above the roll-off
frequency of the TMEN spectra, which is about 230 Hz. By applying this method, we obtain an
average conductivity of 5.8706 x 10? (Q x m)~! with a relative uncertainty of 0.6% within the
examined temperature range 16-670 mK. For the temperature calculation, we use the individual
fit values ogj¢(T) obtained with T12(f).

(d) Noise and temperature spectra

An example of the spectra, from which the pMFFT temperatures are determined, is shown in
figure 5 for a dataset taken at the lowest temperature measured, i.e. ~16mK.
