In both
cases there is delayed metamorphosis resulting in tadpoles the trunk region of which
has grown in size and possesses ectodermal ampulle, and also a tendency for complete
metamorphosis of the trunk to occur without there being any absorption of the tail. * The tendency to metamorphose before liberation from the parent has been seen in M. lanceplaini,

M. complanata, M. cooperi, M. verrucifera, and M. citrina, and in fact is not confined to species of Molgula,
but is common to most viviparous ascidians (see Part I, p. 64). N. J. BERRILL: STUDIES IN TUNICATE DEVELOPMENT. 317
