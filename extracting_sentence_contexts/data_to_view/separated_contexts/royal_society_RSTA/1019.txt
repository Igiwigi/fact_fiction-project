On the same
figures are shown the oxygen curves reproduced from figs. 5, 6, and 7. The following facts are outstanding. Aldehydes.—With Shell petrol alone the aldehydes reach a maximum concentration
at a time coinciding approximately with the moment at which flame reaches the
sampling valve, the occurrence of the maximum being more retarded with respect
to this moment as the throttle opening is increased. ‘This maximum concentration
is of the order of 5 parts in 1,000 when the throttle is 6° open, and of 7 parts in
1000 for the three larger throttle openings.
