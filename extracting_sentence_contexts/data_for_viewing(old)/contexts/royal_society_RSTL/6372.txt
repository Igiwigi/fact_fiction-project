= found by these gentlemen to be traversing the metallic veins in the mines of Cornwall,
A were in many instances portions of great floods of electricity, drifting along the district
in which the mines were placed, forming in fact a portion of larger disturbances attend-
ing on magnetic storms. The derived currents which were collected by their galvano-
meters gave the same contradictory results as to direction that come out from any of
our own cases, looked at individually; but in the papers before me I have no sufficient
data from which to make groups of observations, in order to arrive at probable directions,
nor do I gather whether changes of direction were noted. My impression is that I have
heard of the value of currents being different, collected at different times at the same
Places. It would have been instructive, had it been possible, to compare some of the
