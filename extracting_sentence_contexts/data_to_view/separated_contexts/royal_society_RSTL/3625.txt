I do not think this is a fair inference. If the earth's surface ever
were fluid, the science of geology shows us that it must have ceased to be 80 for
many ages: and the interval affords time enough for the operation of that well-esta-
blished law—that gradual changes of elevation and depression are unceasingly taking
place in the surface, arising no doubt from chemical and mineralogical changes in
the mass—to modify the original curvature of the various parts, making some greater
and others less than before. The argument of the earth's original fluidity lies in the
fact, that the present mean form is that which the earth must have had when it was
fluid.

62. I will conclude this paper by calculating the form of the Indian arc between
Kaliana and Damargida and its two subdivisions. The result affords, I think, the
only explanation of the discordance between the difference of amplitude as brought
out in Colonel Everesr's work, and by my calculation of the amount of deflection.
