Timoshenko (1922, p. 406) gives the solution when the cross-section is an isosceles
triangle for particular values of Poisson’s ratio, and also a simply obtained solution
(Timoshenko 1934, p. 300) for a beam of semi-circular cross-section. This latter is
incorrectly related to the external force system. He finds an incorrect position for the
“flexural centre”’, ie. the point on the axis of symmetry to which the load must be
shifted from the centroid if the associated flexural torsion is omitted. This will be
defined in § 2.

No account of recent work on Saint-Venant’s flexure problem would be com-
plete which did not pay tribute also to the work of Seth (1933) who first published a
solution for the cross-section which is an isosceles right-angled triangle. This, in the
writer’s opinion, is incomplete in so far as he does not relate all the constants of his
solution to the external force system; he does not in fact evaluate the associated flexural
torsion.

The revision, completion, correction and correlation of the conflicting results made
apparent by collecting these solutions together has been very much simplified by the
writer’s discovery that Saint-Venant’s flexure problem is reducible to boundary
problems of the same canonical simplicity as the torsion problem, involving six ‘‘ canoni-
cal flexure functions” of which one is the torsion function for the cross-section.

Young, Elderton and Pearson remark (1918, p. 3) that “the problem of complete
asymmetry still awaits investigation’’. With the aid of the six canonical functions the
writer has carried out such a general investigation in the present paper, providing a
systematic method of relating the necessary constants of a flexure solution to the
