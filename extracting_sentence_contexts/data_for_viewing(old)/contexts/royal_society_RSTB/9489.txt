(d) Broadening the applications of trace evidence
Improving the value of trace evidence also requires broaden-
ing its applications beyond the traditional court purposes. As
the most basic physical information on crime, trace evidence
has the potential to bear answers relevant to intelligence,
investigative and criminological questions. Neglecting these
applications creates a missed opportunity for an area that is
desperately trying to discover extension strategies for its sur-
vival and, more importantly, a net loss of information for
those attempting to solve crime or broader security problems.
However, as described above, exploring such applications is
not easy in a system that is siloed and almost invariably
focused on court purposes. In fact, it appears that some ten-
sion exists between these two broad areas of application,
as data integration is the key to addressing intelligence,
investigative and criminological concerns while extreme frag-
mentation and specialization seems to be required for court
applications. And it is worth remembering that these appar-
ently antagonistic goals should be achieved starting from the
same ‘one-off’ trace, the remnant of activity and/or presence.
For these reasons, the future of trace evidence also depends
on how this duality can be addressed. In the first instance,
this calls for the integration of results into suitable processes
that can lead to solving problems in a collaborative manner
through alternative perspectives. In doing so, the forensic
