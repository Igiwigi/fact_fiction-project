Perhaps the most profound indication that most
societies believe—if unconsciously—in some kind of contin-
ued agency of the dead, is their persistence in the moral
systems of the living. Luper [25] provides a philosophical
treatment of the moral issues surrounding our treatment of
the dead, asking if the dead have moral standing. By demon-
strating that events that happen after an individual’s death can
indeed be good or bad for them (despite the fact that they are
dead)—and thus by affecting their prudential interests it is
possible for us to benefit or harm them posthumously—the
dead can be argued to have moral standing. Given that death constitutes the mental and physical
cessation of an individual in the world, and as at some
point in evolution individuals have come to know that they
can choose when to end their existence within it, death has
come to be imbued with considerable moral responsibility. Two papers focus on suicide.
