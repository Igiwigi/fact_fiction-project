'= Sir WiLLLAM THOMSON, regarding all these phenomena from the lofty point of thermo-
<= dynamics (from which the writer also is about to view them in this paper), has distinctly
S colligated them as referable to dissipation of energy existing in our planet in the form
= Of terrestrial heat, and has given to all its play of phenomena the title of ** Platonic
<V action,” which he defines as © any transformation of energy going on within the earth”
<= (Trans. Geolog. Soc. of Glasgow, vol. iii. pt. ii.).

2. Thewriter accepts Sir WILLLAM THoMs0N's above views, $0 far as he is yet acquainted
A with them through publication, as the broad basis for future physical geology.

Sir WiLLAx Troas0N, however, has not attempted, 80 far as the writer knows, to
bring his general view, that volcanoes, earthquakes, &c. result from transformations of
terrestrial heat, 80 to bear upon the facts known respecting these as to explain in any
way the immediate mechanism from the play of which within our globe these grand
phenomena of nature are produced; nor to connect these with the © elevation theories ”
of geologists, 50 as to substitute a precise and true one for the current and erroneous
notions as to the nature of those forces which have elevated mountain-ranges and
generally produced the inequalities of our globe, apart from the subsequent moulding-
actions of water and other surface agencies.
