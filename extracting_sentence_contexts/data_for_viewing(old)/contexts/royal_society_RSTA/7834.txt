does not appear in those which precede it; thus s, first appears in ®, The
functions may then be regarded as completely arbitrary and independent. Hence
THEOREM X—The quantities ©, for positive integral values of r are arbitrary, for negative
values of r they are zero, and ©, = 1, then
O° = 3 fac |Parer |

Za=n

That this equation is true when © is a generating function is an immediate deduction
from Theorem VIII in Some Generating Functions,* and hence it is true for a wide

range of functions. It was well to determine, whether it expressed an inherent property
of generating functions as such, we see that it does not, that, in fact, it is not a property

of ® at all, but only of the numbers ficdars oe That the value of the left-hand
side of the equation is ®," is seen by considering the last term of the series

which alone of all the terms contains ®,", the only term on the right-hand side not
containing one of the other ©’s.
