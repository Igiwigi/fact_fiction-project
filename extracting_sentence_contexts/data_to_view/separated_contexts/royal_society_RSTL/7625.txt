A third similar cylinder was filled with
gunpowder, and an electric fuse primed with a corresponding quantity of fulminate to
that used in the preceding experiment, was inserted, the mouth of the cylinder being
left quite open, as in the other instances. The explosion of the powder was attended
by a sharp report, the cylinder was rent into several pieces, which were scattered about,
and a cavity was formed in the ground, the earth being projected to a considerable
distance. The effect was, in fact, similar to what would have been produced had the
powder-charge been in a buried and tightly closed shell. Similar results were obtained
in other experiments, confirmatory of the power possessed by a detonation to deyelope
the explosive force of gunpowder, under conditions antagonistic to the violent action of
the latter under ordinary cireumstances. The revults of a few experiments instituted with 8mall charges of gunpowder (8 ozs.
and 1 1b.) appeared to furnish decisive indications that their explosion through the
agency of a detonation was considerably more rapid than when flame was applied tc
their ignition under corresponding conditions.
