In this plane the ectoderm, though still showing a
slight amount of thickening, is wholly free from the underlying mesodermal sheet,
which here covers the thick entoderm of the area opaca.

(d) Primitive Knot.â€”The anterior extremity of the primitive streak has already
been seen to lie in intimate relation with the primitive knot. Even in surface-view
it was apparent that the posterior boundary of the primitive knot is sharply
distinguishable from the streak (cf. fig. 23, Plate 6). And study of sectional
anatomy shows that the tissue of the knot is, in fact, distinguishable from that
of the streak immediately behind it. Text-fig. 10, p. 78, will afford a general conception of the axial relationships
of the parts in question. This figure is a schematic reconstruction of the median
plane of the knot, ete., of Specimen P.
