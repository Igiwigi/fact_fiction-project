Q in order to explain the remarkable fact, that the blood coagulates within a few hours of
© death in the cavities of the heart and great venous trunks, though it retains its fluidity
S for days in the smaller vessels. Thus in the human subject twenty-four hours after death
S Thave found clots in the heart and larger veins, including the upper parts of the axil-
5 lary and femoral trunks, but fluid blood in the lower parts of those vessels and all their
= branches in the limbs. It seemed possible at first that this difference might depend on
= the position of the great vessels in the thorax and abdomen, where decomposition be-
Z gins earlier than in the limbs. But this proved not to be the case; for in a horse twelve
= hours after it had been Killed, I found the blood fluid in the intercostal and small
= cardiac yeins, though coagulated in the yena cava and the coronary vein of the heart,
> which is in that animal of very large size. There being no reason to snppose the walls
= of the larger vessels differently constituted from those of the smaller ones, or more
£ liable to undergo post mortem changes, the natural interpretation of these facts seems

my
E to be that the blood has, even within the body, a certain tendency to coagulation,
= Counteracted by an influence exerted upon it by the containing tissues, which, operating

5 to less advantage the larger the mass of the fluid acted on, fail, at least after death, to

V if we suppose that the tissues are merely passive with regard to the blood, it seems dif-
Z ficult to understand the rapid solidification of a large quantity shed into a cup. For
S We have seen that mere exposure to the atmosphere will not account for the fact;
While at the same time the experiments upon the sheep's foot indicate that an ordinary
80lid has but a very limited range of operation upon the surrounding bloodF, and that
