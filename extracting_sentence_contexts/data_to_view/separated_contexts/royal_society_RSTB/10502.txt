What is certain, however, is that a highly contagious strain
of H5N1 can now be reached in only a few mutations. Such a
strain could allow airborne transmission between mammals
and in this way trigger a major pandemic. In fact such a
strain already exists, thanks to laboratory scientists at University
of Wisconsin-Madison who recently created a deadly variant of
the influenza virus able to outsmart the human immune system
[59]. The somewhat nebulous justification for this work is that it
enables laboratory researchers to better understand such
viruses and how to attack them. Stephen King in his 1978
horror/fantasy novel ‘The Stand’ envisioned the global apoca-
lypse that would ensue were such a virus to escape from the
laboratory.
