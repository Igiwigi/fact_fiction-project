Shydrogen makes a very much greater difference in the rate of combination than that
Bbroduced by the same excess of chlorine,
e The effect of insolating the chlorine alone passes off if the chlorine and hydrogen
“Anixture be left in the dark for some time. The behaviour is then similar to that of
‘She ordinary insolated mixture.
2 There is, therefore, a change produced by the action of light on moist chlorine alone,
“which i is apparent when the chlorine is caused to combine with hydrogen. Draper
Zonsidered that an allotropic modification of chlorine was produced, which combined
Snore readily with hydrogen than ordinary chlorine. It seems more probable that the
Spffect is due to some action between the chlorine and the water vapour, which is
=always present in these experiments. For water vapour, if not absolutely necessary
&to the action, assists it very materially.
a This view is also supported by the fact.discovered by BAker,* that perfectly pure
“gand dry chlorine does not expand when exposed to light, while damp chlorine does so

xpand. We have already seen that the expansion of damp chlorine is attended by
: development of heat. There is then, at any rate, some evidence that the first
Rage of the action to form hydrochloric acid is an action between chlorine alone and

water vapour.
§ 5. Hxpansion Experiments.

To obtain further evidence of the existence of intermediate bodies in the initial
stage of the action between hydrogen and chlorine, use was made of the expansion
method of C. 'T. R. Wurson to discover if any cloud-forming nuclei were produced by
