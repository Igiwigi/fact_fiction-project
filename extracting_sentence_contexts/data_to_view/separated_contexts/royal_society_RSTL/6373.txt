Moreover, as I have already stated, dark-bordered fibres are to be
demonstrated in all parts of the muscular fibre, eyen upon the tendon near its connexion
with the muscular fibres. It is hardly likely that this distribution of coarse fibres oyer
the general surface of the muscles should be associated with a very partial and unequal
distribution of the fine fibres which result from their division, As the broad pale fibres
described by Kitnxe are really composed of several fine fibres (Plates XLII. & XIIIE
figs. 14, 16, 18, & 20), which are often connected by transverse branches 80 as to form. a
network, and as the fine compound fibres gradually become finer and finer until they
cease to be visible, it is still more improbable that what appeared to him and Kd
to be ends should be real natural terminations, than if the arrangement had been as
Kinxs has described it. Tt, seems therefore to me that the only inference which can be
drawn from the facts demonstrated is, that the neryes terminate in a network : but there
are still two modes of arrangement possible with regard to the distribution of this network.

1. It may be confined to one part of the muscular fibre.

2. It may extend doyn the fibre throughout its entire length.
