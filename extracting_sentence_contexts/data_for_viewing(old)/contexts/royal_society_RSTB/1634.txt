A The widespread persistency of a vestigial and useless air-bladder seems to be
uliar to the Ustariophysea ; in fact, we know of no species in any of the different
Fimilies of the pronp in which an air-bladder is entirely wanting. On the contrary, so
Hr as our knowledge extends, this faet is altogether without parallel in all the
Pimaining families of Teleostei, in which total suppression seems invariably to follow
“Bs9 OF function. There are, however, tivo points in connection with the air-bladder of the
Biluride abnormales that wre not without some significance, and may possibly furnish au
Explanation of this anomaly, The first has reference to the method by which the
Bedaetion of the bladder Las been effected. We have previously pointed out that the
Zestigial aiv-bladder in these Siluroids represents the unterior chumber only of the
Sormmlly developed organ, and that the lateral compartments have almost always
Findengone total uttophy. The process of reduction has, therefore, not aifected all
Sfarta of the air-bladder to an equal extent, and, while it has almost invariably led to
ghe total suppression of all trace of lateral chambers, the anterior chamber hus been
