On cutting, the CO, absorption became very much greater, showing that the
small amount obtained before was due to closure of the stomata (see Exp. XX VII.). As regards the change in form of the curve (fig. 2), Experiment XIX., Table IV., in
which the temperature was gradually raised during a reading, gives a very good
demonstration of the fact that at +3°6 C. the value of the assimilation is already
quite the same as that represented by the level portion of the curve, while numerous
other experiments show that this is not the case for the values below +2° C.

It was impossible to believe that the influence of the temperature on the assimila-
tion really changed its character in the sharp and sudden manner the curve suggested,
and yet the true interpretation was not at first sight obvious. K 2
