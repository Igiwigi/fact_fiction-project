indicated by the intimate relation this structure shows to the nucleolus in the
young oocyte, in which the as yet relatively inactive metabolism permits of a massed
arrangement of the chromatin.

(2) Origin of the Basophile Substance of the Nucleolus.—The origin of the
basophile constituent of the nucleolus presents more difficulty. We have seen that
there is reason to believe the activity of the chromatin to be continued for some
time at least after the simultaneous completion of yolk formation and cessation of
nucleolar activity. The only structure, therefore, which in its behaviour shows a
direct temporal relation to the cessation of nucleolar activity is the cytoplasm.
On the completion of yolk formation there is not only an abrupt cessation of
nucleolar activity, but there is also a sudden failure in the supply of the basophile
nucleolar constituent, a fact which certainly points to the cytoplasm as the source
for this substance.

It is not, however, only the completion of yolk formation, but also the complete
cessation of all cytoplasmic activity, which coincides with the termination of
nucleolar activity. As we have already seen, the production of the basophile
nucleolar substance shows no relation to the commencement of yolk formation, but
is produced continuously throughout the growth of the egg. This substance must
be the result, therefore, not of yolk formation itself, but of a much more fundamental
vital process of the cytoplasm, a conclusion which is supported by the fact that we
already have, in the “ peripheral spherules” presently to be described, an obvious
by-product of the actual process of yolk formation.*
