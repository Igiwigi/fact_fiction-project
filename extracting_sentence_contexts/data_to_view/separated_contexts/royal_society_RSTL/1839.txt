229. Hence it is evident that there is no discharge of the current at the
centre of the magnet, for the current, now freely eyolyed, is up through the
magnet ; but in the first experiment (226.), it was down. In fact, at that time,
it was only the part of the moving metal equal to a little dise extending from
the end of the wire B in the mercury to the wire A that was efficient, i. e.
moving with a different angular velocity to the rest of the circuit (258.); and
for that portion the direction of the current is consistent with the other results. 230.
