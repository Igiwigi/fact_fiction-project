It works by undirected
processes such as mutation and selection and thus tries all constructional possibilitiesâ€”the vast
majority of mutations are detrimental and will disappear. But out of discussion are million
years of research and development for technical engineering: the material scientist has a goal
to fabricate a particular product in a limited time, using experimental trial-and-error approaches,
calculation and modelling. The crucial point is the fact that an engineer must have a particular
target of what he wants to reach. The unexpected, the unthinkable, cannot be in his thoughts: this
is the second crucial difference to biological evolution. It may have taken a couple of decades to identify microscopic elastic egg-beaters with
nanoscopic wax crystals and hydrophilic pins for persistent air retention under water, but the
floating fern Salvinia had over 30 myr to perfect them by mutation and selection in its evolution.
