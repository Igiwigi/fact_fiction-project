REPRODUCTION OF THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT 113

ostium abdominale lies much nearer to the free edge of the sac, and the course of the
Fallopian tube is less easily apparent than his drawing suggests. ‘he portion of the tube
proximal to the ovary runs beneath the peritoneum in the outer wall of the ovarial sac. In
a fresh specimen its course can just be made out by stretching this wall, and it is not visible
from the inner surface. As the course of the tube is followed towards the uterine horn it
sinks farther in from the peritoneal surface, and the junction of the tube with the lumen of
the horn is deep in the musculature and connective tissue and can only be found by
dissection. That Watson’s illustration differs from the arrangement here described may be
due to his specimen being one of the Indian genus, but it may equally well be due to its
being an animal whose development has been affected by a life in captivity, to which fact
it is at least safe to attribute the small size and apparently inactive condition of the ovary
itself. The outer compartment of the ovarial sac is fimbriated, while the inner compartment
is lined with peritoneum. The arrangement of the peritoneal structures in this region would
appear to be different from that of other mammals as yet described. As developmental
stages are available in the present material, it has been possible to trace the manner in
which the adult condition is arrived at, and the subject is dealt with in greater detail
below (p. 118).

The lumen of the Fallopian tube leads directly into that of the uterine horn, but it was
found impossible to force a perfusing fluid through the lumen past this junction, either in
the intact organs or when the tube, with the surrounding musculature, had been dissected
out. In the latter case, however, if the tube was severed immediately above its junction
