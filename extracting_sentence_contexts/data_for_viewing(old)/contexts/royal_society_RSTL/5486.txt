It is unnecessary to enunciate separately a similar proposition for curves of no
transmission ; for the demonstration of Proposition I., on which all their properties
depend, is evidently applicable to an aggregate constituted in any manner.

Henee it appears, that jf the isothermal curves for an aggregate be drawn accord-
ing to the above definition, all the propositions proved in this paper respecting homo-
geneous substances become true of the aggregate.

(36.) ProposrTron NV.—Tnzorem. Every Isothermal line for an aggregate of a
liquid and its vapour, is a straight line of equal pressure, from the volume corresponding
to complete liquefaction to the volume corresponding to complete evaporation.

This is a fact known by experiment. The Theorem is equivalent to a Statement,
that the pressnre of a liquid and its vapour in contact with each other, is a function
of the temperature only.

Corollary. —TnrortEm. At any given temperature, the volume of an aggregate of
liquid and vapour is arbitrary between and up to the limits of total liquefaction and
total evaporation.

To express this symbolically, let P be the pressure of an aggregate of liquid and
