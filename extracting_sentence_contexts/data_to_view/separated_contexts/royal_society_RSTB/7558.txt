Husain, Mathur &
Roonwal (1949) found that the amount of food consumed per day was at a maximum
between 33 and 37° C, falling off at lower and higher temperatures, the maximum rate of
development being at about the same intermediate temperature. If maximum activity were to occur at excessive temperatures, as a fixed law, that would
imply that activity itself was something ‘abnormal’, imposed on the animal directly from
outside, and that complete inactivity was the normal state. In fact, complete inactivity is
abnormal behaviour for locusts. In the field the maximum sustained activity occurs at
moderate temperatures, as it might also, judging from the work on other insects, under
appropriately arranged laboratory conditions. Inasmuch as they show maximum activity at moderate, and minimum activity at exces-
sive temperatures, migrants in the field behave in a way that corresponds with the behaviour
of non-migrants.
