Burma
comprises Arakan, Upper Burma, the Shan States, Pegu, Karenni, and Tenasserim. The terms applied to the great zoological subdivisions of the earth’s surface are
those used by LypeKkeEr in ‘A Geographical History of Mammals,’ pp. 27, &c., and
are somewhat altered from those employed by myself in 1890.* The names Arctogzea,
Notogzea (Australia, &¢.), and Neogzea (South America) are applied to the primary
zoological divisions of the world or zoological realms, and the Arctogean realm

. comprises five regions—the Sonoran, Holarctic, Ethiopian, Malagasy, and Oriental.t
The greater part of India and its dependencies are included in the last named, but
the higher Himalayas are within Holarctic limits, and, as will be shown, the fauna
of North-western India contain too large a proportion of Holarctic, or, as they are
generally called, Palearctic, types for it to be included in the Oriental or Indo-Malay
region. It must be understood that the regions named are founded on the distribution
of Mammalia, and are not either necessarily, or, in fact, identical with those which
correspond with the distribution of other classes of Vertebrata or of any Inverte-
brates. The class of Birds, taken as a whole, appears to coincide better with the
Mammals in distribution than other classes do. As a guide to the demareation of
regions and subregions in the present paper, terrestrial mammalia ave regarded as
of primary importance.
