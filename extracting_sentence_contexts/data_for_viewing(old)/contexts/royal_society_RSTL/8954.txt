PovrraLs places the genus Pliobothrus amongst the Milleporide. The Rugosa he
places at the end of the true corals. He has by the examination of the Lophophyllum
proliferum (M.-Epwarps and Haig) come to the conclusion that the tetrameral
arrangement claimed for the Rugosa is only apparent, there being originally six
primary s8epta. The coral was examined by cutting successive transverse sections.
Such a section from the tip of Lophophyllum proliferum, representing the youngest stage,
shows six primary septa and six interseptal spaces placed symmetrically on two sides of
a vertical plane and unequally developed. By unequal development of additional septa
in further development (investigated by the examination of sections successively
nearer to the margin of the calicle) the seeming tetrameral arrangement is produced.
PovrrTaLEs refers to papers on the subject by Rater and LixpsrrOM, and cites L. LUDWIG
(H. von Meyer's © Palewontographica,” vols. x. & xiv.) as having shown the same facts and
come to like conclusions concerning the affinities of the Rugosa, publishing his results
before PoURTALES.

A. Kvuxn (Zeitschrift der dentsch. geol. Ges. xxi. Heft 3) is also cited by
Pourralts. KuNTH has examined the law of growth of the Rugosa chiefly by the con-
sideration of the successive development of the costzee. He till adheres to the tetrameral
primary division, from want, in the opinion of PouRTaLis, of having examined individuals
of yery young age and hence great simplicity.

Kr is further quoted in Tzvcxant's Jahresbericht, 1870-71, p. 192, as finding
the analogue of the operculum of Zoantharia Rugosa in the folds of skin described
by Mitxe-Epwarps as occurring in Cryptohelia pudice * trotz der fehlenden Verkalkung.”
