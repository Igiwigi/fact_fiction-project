here realise more easily what goes on ab the source of energy. The results obtained
suggest that a similar action occurs at the gource of energy or seab of the electromotive
force in other cages where we do not know the distribution of induction, and are
obliged to guess at the action.

ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC INDUCTIONS IN THE SURROUNDING FIELD. 289

A eireuit containing & voltaic cal.

Q We may pass on from the discharge of a condenser to the consideration of the

Qcurrent in a circuit containing a voltaic cell. The chemical theory of the cell will be
hero adoptedâ€”in fact, the hypothesis I am endeavouring to set forth has no meaning
Son the voltaic metal-contact theory.
= Leb us suppose the cell to consist of zinc and copper plates, a vessel of dilute
=pulphuric acid, and copper wires attached to each plate which on junetion complete the
Seircuit. For simplicity I shall disregard the effect of the air and suppose that it is a
-Zneutral gas causing no induction.
:Z We 8ball begin by supposing the circuit open. Then we know that on immersion
here will be temporary currents in the wires, the quantities of these currents depend-
Sing on the electrostatic capacity of the system composed of the wires. The currents
Slasb till the wires have received charges 8wch that they are, say at difference of
potential V. If the terminals are connected to a condenser the temporary currents
Emay be easily detected by a galvanometer in the circuit. They are in no way to be
Edistinguished in kind from the permanent current which will be established when the
