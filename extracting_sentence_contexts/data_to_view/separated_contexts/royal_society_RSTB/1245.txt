This point is of interest for comparison with Lepidostrobus (see below, p. 526).
turning to early phases again, abnormal cell-divisions are occasionally met with ;
8@ are not to be ascribed to oblique cutting of the sections, for the presence of a
tinuous vascular strand has in each case been taken as a criterion of the section
ing truly in the radial plane. In such sections it may occasionally be seen that the
perficial cells divide again, very early, by periclinal walls; the inner cells thus
rmed (0, 0, figs. 61, 62) are believed to be added to the sporogenous tissue, but
iis has not been distinctly proved. In view of the fact that such additions to the
sorogenous tissue are constant in Hqwisetum, as above described, there can be no
priori objection to this view, which will also gain further strength from facts to be
leseribed in the case of Isoetes.

Neither GorBeL nor SADEBECK gives details of tangential sections ; both Jen
question open as to the number of cells of which the archesporium is compg
indeed, whether all may not be referable to a single parent. SADEBECK (note,

p- 313) remarks that this question is unimportant ; to this view I cannot agree,

Tangential sections of sporophylls of about the same age as that shown in fie
solve the question at once (fig. 63); here the same regularly disposed superficial
are found, as have been noted in the radial sections; some of these haye »
divided by periclinal walls, others are still undivided.
