On the day on which the obseryations were made on the hedgehogs, the
atmosphere being 49?, that of two dormice was 52* ; on the succeeding day,
the external temperature being 47?, that is, lower by two degrees, the tempe-
rature of one of these dormice was 92*, and that of the other 94*; and only

three hours afterwards, the temperatures were 60* and 70* respectiyely, with
a slight appearance of lethargy.

The hedgehog and the dormouse appear, in fact, to awake from the call of
hunger, then to eat, and then again to become dormant, in temperatures which
may be termed moderate. The bat, which could not find food if it did awake,
does not undergo these periodical changes, except in the sxummer season. It
appears to me, from the most careful observation, that there is every degree
between the ordinary sleep of these animals and the most profound hyber
nation.

It is quite obvious, from these obseryations, that the ordinary sleep of hyber-
nating animals differs from that of others, by inducing a more impaired state of
the respiration and of the evolution of heat, with an augmented power of bear-
ing the abstraction of the atmospheric air. This sleep probably passes into
true hybernation, as the blood which circulates through the brain becomes
