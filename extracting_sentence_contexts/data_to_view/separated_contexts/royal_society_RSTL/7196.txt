from that obtained by the action of hydriodic acid. Z It therefore appears that methyl-noropianic acid is monobasic. The fact that opi-
Zanic acid when heated with excess of strong caustic potash splits up into meconin and
Zhemipinic acid, leads us to hope that methyl-noropianic acid would with the same reagent
Zundergo a similar decomposition. It was, however, found that the acid remains unal-
Aered; for after treating it with strong caustic potash, a silyer-salt was made, which
Sviclded on ignition 39:5 per cent. silyer, methyl-noropianate of silver requiring 35:64
per cent.
