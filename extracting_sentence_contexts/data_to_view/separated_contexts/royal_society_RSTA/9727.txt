The following equations simply express the law of variation of D,, with temperature,
as shown by the above three equations :—

D,2/(Dys)) = (0/0) (rigid elastic spheres),

n+3

Dy[(Die) = (0/6,)2—»
D,,/( Dis) = (0/0,)*" { i+ O,./0}/4 1+ C,,/0} (attracting spheres).

(point-centres of force),

So far as I am aware, the variation of the coefficient of diffusion with the
temperature has never been properly examined experimentally ; the values of D,, are
generally found only at one temperature, or two at most, and this is insufficient to
decide between the second and third of the laws just given. From the analogous
behaviour of viscosity, as affected by temperature, however, the third law is probably
ked out by SUTHERLAND on this
ant C,., it is desirable that
diffusion with

most nearly true, and the values of C,, have been wor
hypothesis.t In view of the importance of the const
further experiments be made on the variation of the coefficient of
temperature.

+ The present theory shows that C,, the temperature constant for diffusion, is a different multiple o
the mutual potential of two molecules in contact from that in the case of Cy, the temperature constant ft
viscosity. This fact was not indicated in SUTHERLAND’S investigation ; see Phil. Mag.’ (5), 38, p. 1, 1894
