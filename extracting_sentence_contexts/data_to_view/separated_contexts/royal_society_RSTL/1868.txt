A convincing proof that the green

coat of the muscular scar which occupies the outer edge of the front part of the
penultimate, and the hinder part of the last whorl, has covered all parts of the
operculum, except the front half of the last whorl, which in turning has not
yet been brought under its influence, may be readily obtained by scratching
off the thin black coat, when the green will be found beneath it in all parts

except that last referred to. The surface of the scar jtself also demonstrates the
fact of the revolution, its hinder edge being raised and definite ; while its front
edge, which is progressive, is double, the posterior of the two portions being
elevated, and the anterior, to which the muscle is just becoming attached, being
thin and ill defined. It has been often supposed that shells which have a toothed mouth never
have any distinct operculum ; but the exceptions as regards annular or spiral
opercula are numerous; thus Helicina avreola and H. depressa, and all the
Polyodonta, as P. clangulus, &c., have large and regular opercula. The genus Fermetus has an orbicular horny concave operculum, like that of
a Trochus, but differing in having a large, orbicular, irregularly grooved, mus-
cular scar, placed in the centre instead of on the anterior side.
