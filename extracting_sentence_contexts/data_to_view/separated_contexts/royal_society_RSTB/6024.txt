On the other hand, radial walls should
have constantly varying inclinations. The wall is extending in length, and it seems that
the effect of this extension on the inclination of the micelles will not be considerably
disturbed by the lateral expansion of the cell during differentiation. The case of
the radial walls is analogous to that described above (p. 143) and to which the formula
L = K cot 0 applies if we make one assumption, an assumption which is, in fact, forced
upon us. Ifthe radial expansion of a cambial initial after each longitudinal division
causes any flattening of that part of the spiral on it, we should expect the inclination of
the micelles in the radial walls of the tracheids cut off to be almost 90Â° within a very
short time. Actually no such increase in inclination was observed, the part of the
spiral on radial walls becoming steeper with time in all cases.
