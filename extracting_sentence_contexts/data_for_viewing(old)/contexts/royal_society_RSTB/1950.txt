Qeonditions, torn off and expelled, and in many instances the products normally
Sextruded between tides are found to consist partly of immature sexual cells. Such
Bobservations prove that some sort of mechanical pressure is exerted on the contents
sf the conceptacles, and it is produced, at least in part, by a shrinkage of the cortical
‘cells of the plant which results in their sinking inwards and thereby exerting a
‘Spressure upon the mucilaginous cells of the medulla, and hence of course also upon the
inner wall of the conceptacles. Furthermore, this contraction of the cortex causes
‘the ostioles to gape widely, thus providing ready facility for the egress of the
Zeonceptacular contents.
5 The production of a supply of free mucilage is essential to the ensuring of proper
extrusion. Young, and consequently immature, receptacular portions of the frond
fof F. platycarpus for example are found when cut open to present a woolly
appearance in the interior. This is due to the fact that the loose medullary cell-rows
have not undergone that change in their walls which, later on, leads to the production
of a plentiful supply of mucilage. The latter, however, becomes extremely abundant
when the period of maturity arrives.

On the other hand, the tissues of old receptacles are found to be destitute of

A mucilage (which has all been long ago squeezed out) ; and although examination of the
conceptacles may shew them to be full of ripe sexual cells, no extrusion takes place
under these circumstances.

Again, if receptacles which have begun to extrude are placed in sea-water, it can
be seen that the expelled products are pushed away from behind as the additional
