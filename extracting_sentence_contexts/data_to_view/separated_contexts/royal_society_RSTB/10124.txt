Expert musicians are indeed an extraordinary popu-
lation to study how specific training can shape
somatosensory [13], motor [14], and auditory representations
[15], as well as multimodal integration brain networks [16]. Musicians allowed the investigation of long-term structural
[17] and short-term functional [18] plastic changes in the
brain. In fact, sensorimotor integration in music could be the
result of repeated co-occurrence of action and perceptual pro-
cesses, with the additional advantage of being spread with
different degrees of expertise among the population [19]. In
fact, it has also been shown that specific postural and kinematic
features associated with playing one instrument shape the
activity of sensorimotor cortical areas during music listening. This result further suggests that motor training affects music
perception [20].
