The statistical
comparisons of the ovaries of the birds of the two races in February and March are given
in table 9. The same method of comparison is followed as in the case of the males. From
this it is seen that in February P, the probability that the two races are in fact identical,
is less than two in a hundred, and therefore the observed differences are probably significant. In March, as P is less than 0-01, the differences observed must be considered significant. TABLE 9
