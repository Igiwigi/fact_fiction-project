The fused silyer
thus obtained was examined for occluded oxygen, following the method of Duwasf in
his recent experiments. Tt was supported upon a thin layer of pure lime in a hard
glass tube, and heated to moderate redness in a SPRENGEL vacuum. The amount of
oxygen given off was less than that obtained by Dunas, doubtless owing to the fact
that his 8ilver was fused under nitre and borax, while mine was, as just stated, melted
on a surface of carbon with no flux. He obtained at the rate of 57 c.c. of oxygen
(for 0* C. and 760 m.m.) per kilogramme of silver, and in other experiments, prolong-
ing notably the time of fusion, as much as 158 c.c. and 174 c.c. I obtained but
34-63 c.c. per kilogramme, and in another experiment made by Mr. SaNTos, then a
student in this Laboratory, the silver having been fused upon ordinary wood charcoal,
but 30:12 c.c. was given off. All the silver ased in the atomic weight determinations
