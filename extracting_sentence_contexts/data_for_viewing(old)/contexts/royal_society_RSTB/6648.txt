With data from so few specimens available it is clearly unwise to attempt to draw any
general conclusions, but it is of interest to notice that the teeth of specimens B and C,
and also of Stewart’s specimen are of considerably greater length than are the teeth
of specimen A, despite the fact that in specimen A the teeth had already erupted.

It had been generally accepted that the diameters of teeth cannot increase after
eruption has occurred until DonaLpson and FRencu (1927) claimed to prove an
increase in size of the crowns of the molars of albino rats after they had erupted.
Beusr (1930) showed the same thing in the teeth of the pig. It is known that there is
some sort of metabolic activity in the dentine of erupted teeth even in man (Fisu 1933,
p. 49). H. E. and F. D. Woop (1931) deny that any diametric growth occurs in the
molars of the rat after eruption. Too few data are available to settle the question,
though it would seem improbable, a priori, that any such growth can take place.
