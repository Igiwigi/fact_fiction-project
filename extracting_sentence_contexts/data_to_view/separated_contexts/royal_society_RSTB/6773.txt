79, Plate 19. Assuming that in this, as in the others, the affected
regions represent about one coil, a stretching of the order of 200% is shown by this
specimen (see Appendix IT). The fact that ‘‘necks”’ are still conspicuous objects at late anaphase, indicates that
recovery from stretching is a slower and more difficult process than recovery from
straightening. Recovery has certainly occurred in fig. 76 (see Appendix IT), but it
can never be completely followed owing to the onset of the diffuse stage of interkinesis.
