It will be remembered it rose in value
suddenly by about one part in 300 during the observations. The result in Experi-
ment 9 is too high. This is, no doubt, due to the fact that the temperature of the
bottle cell was varying somewhat. The temperature of the bath changed between the
morning and afternoon observations on August 14 by 0Â°5 C. Now, our observations
have shown us that the E.M.F. of the cell lags behind the temperature when this is
changing. This lag is due to the time taken in changing the state of concentration
of the zinc sulphate solution.
