It is true he makes the addition, © I have several times observed the
arrangement, one upon another, of the nuclei of cells; hut do not know what it
indicates. It is also very possible that the coalescence of cells may take place to form
a fibre ; but hitherto I have no decisive observationsh.” It affords me satisfaction to
find that, while bringing forward facts opposed to the views of this excellent ob-
server, I am not without an admission—very important as coming from him—of the
possibility that the fibres may arise by another mode. 176, It remains to add, that the appearance now and then, in very large numbers,
and in parallel lines, of objects such as those in figs. 157, 158, 159, has led me to
believe that the fibre of the lens is formed by the coalescence of the cells in question,
previously arranged in a line.
