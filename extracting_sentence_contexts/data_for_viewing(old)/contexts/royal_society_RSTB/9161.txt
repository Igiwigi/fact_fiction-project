fails [30].

Assuming isometric scaling of the claw tip radius, larger
animals would therefore face two significant problems when
engaging claws during climbing: their claws would not only
find fewer ‘usable’ asperities, but they would also fracture
and wear more easily due to the smaller ratio of claw tip
radius to body weight. This problem is potentially aggravated
by the fact that the number of usable asperities decreases with
the claw tip radius only up to a surface-specific cut-off length,
above which it decays even more quickly. Stones, for example,
have only few larger asperities, as they are smoothed by wind
and water [30]. We are not aware of any study of claw tip diam-
eter in relation to body weight, and thus it remains unclear how
climbing animals cope with this problem, and whether claws of
larger animals are indeed worse at gripping on substrates with
small asperities. If selection favours a constant number of

scopic length scales [15,16]. Analysing attachment structures
in organisms of different size is thus important to reveal
potential solutions.
