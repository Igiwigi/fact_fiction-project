In §2 of the present paper we develop a different method for describing oblique
propagation of a magneto-ionic component through the ionosphere, avoiding the use
of a refractive index uv which depends in a complicated way upon an unknown angle of
refraction y. This method makes the validity of Schekulin’s result almost obvious. The
explanation of the result depends on the fact that in a doubly refracting medium the
direction of group-propagation in general differs from that of phase-propagation. Fig. 2 represents only the phase-propagation of a magneto-ionic component, whereas
it is the group-propagation which yields a cuspless ray of more conventional type. The level of reflexion of a magneto-ionic component is the level where its direction of
group-propagation becomes horizontal.
