and consequent minimum exposure to intense light which promotes excessive trans-
piration), further specialisation along the same path would lead to the condensed
conoidal construction still retaining a full number of flowers. The flattening of the
only apparently tangentially extended scales by excessive radial retardation follows ;
and the pressure of the growing ovules, no longer fully compensated by internodal
extension of the main axis, opens up chinks between the scales into which the free ends
of the floral members grow to fill up all available room. Hence the thin laminar
extension of the perianth, which soon finds a new use from the standpoint of wind
dispersal ; and this, with consequent precocity of formation, usurps the place of all
other useless parts. There is no reason why these may not have once included
functionless stamens derived from a once hermaphrodite flower, although there is
no direct proof available at the present time. These correlations are not merely
fanciful: they afford a logical sequence for the deduction of the fact, sufficiently
obvious, though requiring to be â€˜established, that the ancestral cone was a more
elongated strobilus, in the axils of whose scales arose centric flowers and a centric
nucellus invested by centric envelopes, without lateral extensions. Furthermore, in
such a cone, the scales would at some time have been separated by internodal

extension, so that the pollen-grains fell between the scales directly on the nucellus ;
the micropyle being a mere collecting funnel to which a long tube was non-essential
and non-existent. That is to say, it is sufficiently clear that at one time (1) the cone
must have had an opening mechanism ; (2) it was originally essentially strobiloid
