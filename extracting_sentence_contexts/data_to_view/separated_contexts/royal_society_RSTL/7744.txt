The linear /-fold relation is satisfied if we assume the increments proportional to the
coordinates—this is, in fact, assuming that the point remains unaltered, We may write
(3x, dy, . . .)=(x, y, - - -), 8ince in such an equation only the ratios are attended to. But it
may be preferable to write (3z, 3y, . ..)=a(&, y,. . .). Tn particular if k=m, then the
increments are connected by a linear m-fold relation; that is, the ratio of the increments
is uniquely determined; and as the relation is satisfied by taking the increments propor-
tional to the coordinates, it is clear that the yalues which the linear m-fold relation gives
for the increments are in fact proportional to the coordinates: viz. there is not in this
case any consecutive point.

67. Considering the þ-fold relation as belonging to a &-fold locus in the m-space, 80
that (, y, .. .)'are the coordinates of a point on this locus, then if in the linear k-fold
relation between the increments these increments are replaced by the coordinates (x, y, . . .)
of a point in the 1-space, then considering the original coordinates (a, y, - - -) as para-

meters, the locus of the point (x, y, ---) is a &-fold omal locus: it is to be obseryed that,
by what precedes, the linear &-fold relation is satisfied by writing therein the values
X:Y,--.=#:, -.-, that is, the {fold emal locus passes through the original point
(z, y, - ++); the &-fold omal locus is said to be the tangent-omal of the original Þ-fold
locus at the (point &, y, - - -), which point is said to be the point of contact.

68. Tf in the original £-fold locus we replace (#, y, . ..) by (x, y, ...), and combine
therewith the -fold linear relation, we have between the coordinates (x, y, .. .) a 2/-fold
relation (containing as parameters the coordinates (a, y, ...)); these parameters satisfy
the original þ-fold relation, and in virtue hereof the 24-fold relation (whether 2 is or is
not greater than m) is satisfied by the values x, y,...=2:y:...; and not only s0, but
the point in question is a nodal or donble point on the 24-fold locus.
