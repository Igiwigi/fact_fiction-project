the three stations in England will show these irregularities, while on some other
three days none or very few will be shown.

It would seem as though some irregular or possibly regular series of waves occurred
at the boundary, changing H, rapidly by from 0°5 to 1 km., and T, by 5° C., or
occasionally even more, and I am inclined to think that there is some connection
between these disturbances and the small pressure waves of short period that are not
infrequently shown on the micro-barograph.

Discussion of the Results.

The tables and figures given in the preceding part of this paper are, I hope,
observational facts about which there can be no serious dispute. In addition to the
observations in Europe we have a certain amount of information from the tropical
and equatorial regions, and from America. It is certain that as the equator is
approached the value of H, rises, and that of T, falls. The observations are not
sufficient to show the connection between H,, T,, and the latitude, but as an
approximation we may take H, = 16 km. and T, = —80° C, at the equator.

Any theory that is to explain the general circulation of the atmosphere, the
distribution of temperature, and the formation of storms, must agree with the
observed facts, but it is extremely difficult to form any theory without being involved
at once in a mass of contraditions. Yet the motion and temperature of the
atmosphere must be dependent on the well-known principles of mechanics and
thermodynamics, and it ought to be possible to get some clue that may lead toa
