methods in paramagnetic bodies 80 strongly influential as satnrated solution of iron,
nickel or cobalt, it can hardly be expected to manifest itself by analogous actions
in the much weaker cases of diamagnetic substances.

2828. When a <pherical paramagnetic conductor is placed midway in a field of
equal magnetic force, it occupies a place of unstable equilibrium, from which, if it be
displaced ever 80 little, it will continue to move until it has gained the iron boundary
walls of the field (2465. 2810.) ; this is a consequence of its particular polar condition. If the sphere were free to change its form, it would elongate in the direction of the
magnetic axis; or if it were a solid of an elongated form, it would point axially, both
consequences of its polar condition (2811.).

2829. $0 also in the case of diamagnetic bodies, their peculiar condition of polarity
is shown by corresponding facts, namely, by a spherical portion having its place of
stable equilibrium in the middle of the magnetic field (2812.), by a fluid portion tend-
ing to expand equatorially and become an oblate spheroid (2813.), and by the equa-
torial pointing of an elongated portion (2812.). If pointed magnetic poles are used,
then the effects are very much stronger, but are exactly the same in kind, and
dependent upon the same causes and polar conditions.

2830. There are another set of effects produced, which are either the results of the
axial polarity just referred to, or else may be considered as consequences of the con-
dition of the equatorial parts of the conductors (2824.).
