It is important not to confuse parallel biological features,
due to similar response to similar xerophytie conditions, with indications of
phylogenetic relationship. The flower of Cycadeoidea is also, it is true, a generalised
anthrostrobilus, with perianth region, andreecium, and gyncecium, each independently
specialised and non-conformable in phyllotaxis construction. It also presents a much
less tendency to minimum construction, each region is still practically “ indefinite,”
though this is in agreement with the fact that the flowers’ of Cycadeoidea were
large and solitary, while those of Welwitschia are small and enclosed in spikelets or
strobiloid inflorescence constructions. On the other hand, special features of the floral
mechanism are also in agreement. The peculiar staminal tube is much the same in
both types, as a biological adaptation to subserve the investment and protection of
the gyncecium during the period of expansion, probably as much as a shield from the
action of intense light as from simple desiccation (cf.
