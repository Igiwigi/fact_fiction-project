A glance at the atomic weights of the chief members of the arsenic group of elements
shows that yanadium has an atomic weight which places it between phosphorus and
arsenic :—

The fact that, in a family of which several members exert a highly poisonous action,
a new metal could be found whose atomic weight was nearly the mean of that of the
two members possessing the greatest toxicological interest appeared to render the
research an important one ; and the interest was enhanced by the fact that vanadium
possesses an atomic weight very nearly the same as that of a poisonous metal not
belonging to the arsenic group, but whose compounds bear some resemblance to those
of vanadium, viz. chromium :—

Vanadium forms four series of compounds. First, a pentad series, of which vanadic
oxide, V, O,, may be taken as a representative ; this oxide forms soluble vanadates with
