I exposed the spinal marrow, separated the distinct roots, and found
that the anterior root on being irritated excited motion, while the posterior root
did not excite the muscles. By inference, and by comparing the spinal nerves with
those of the encephalon, I was at length led to conclude that the anterior root is
provided for motion, and the posterior for sensation; and that the spinal nerves,
instead of being common nerves, are in truth combined of roots, one of which gives
motion and the other sensation. Many instances have presented themselves in the prosecution of this subject, to
show that, until directed by a knowledge of function, we are inattentive to facts of
daily occurrence. To take an example, since I had reason to conclude that the
columns of the spinal marrow, and the roots arising from them, were distinct in func-

with paraplegia, in which the muscular power of the limbs has not been the first
affected: in all, the defect of motion has been greater than the diminution of sensi-
bility ; in some, the motion of the limbs has been lost, whilst the sensibility has been
exquisitely acute.
