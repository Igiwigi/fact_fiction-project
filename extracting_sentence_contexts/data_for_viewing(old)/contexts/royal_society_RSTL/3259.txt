that the germinal spot (as such) has disappeared, and that in its stead are several
vesicles with intermediate granules h. From those yesicles the germinal vesicle (c.)
did not appear to differ except in its greater size. This was the effect of incipient
decomposition. Here then the germinal spot (possibly, as supposed by Scuwaxx, a

sicles; a fact, which seems deserving of notice, as being the result of decomposition,

300. The primordial germ, as already stated, seems to be a nucleus, And here we
find the most important of all nuclei resolving itself entirely into vesicles,—the first of
these vesicles containing that which I have denominated the peripheral portion of
the germ (Plate VIII. fig. 148. b4?.). (See the primitive changes in the germ par. 209.

301. The vesicles exhibited in Plate VIII. fig. 149. constituted part of the incipient
embryo in an oyum of 1114 hours and measuring 4”. They were drawn after removal
from their situation, and after the ovum had lain forty-eight hours in kreosote water,
It will be seen that those vesicles contained two or even three minuter vesicles, in-
closed the one within the other, The arrangement was not concentric, all the vesicles
