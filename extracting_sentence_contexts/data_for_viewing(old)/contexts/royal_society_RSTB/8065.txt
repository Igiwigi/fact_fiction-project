Like M. senonensis, M. corbovis had a thinner test than the contemporary forms of the
main phylum; and, again like M. senonensis, it tended to lag behind the ‘main-line’
forms in the evolution of such details as the ambulacra, the labrum, the anterior
groove, etc. M. corbovis differs from M. lesket and from M. cortestudinarium in shape,
and, like M. senonensis, it is a rather large form.

At the end of the zone of Holaster planus there seems to have been a fairly sudden change
in the conditions of life. The ecological niche occupied by Micraster corbovis vanished, and
one opened suitable for the members of the other branch phylum. This phylum, which
comes off from the main stock at the bottom of the zone of M. cortestudinarium, comprises
the forms which are placed in the species M. senonensis. It goes on, evolving parallel
to the main stock, until it disappears in the zone of Marsupites. If Micraster senonensis
were more common, the fact that it is not found below the base of the zone of M. cor-
testudinarium, i.e. it is confined to the Senonian, might be of practical use to the field
geologist.

As both M. corbovis and M. senonensis intergrade with their contemporaries of the main
phylum, it is almost certain that interbreeding took place between the main and the
branch phyla. ‘This would be disadvantageous to both the stocks in which it took place
by hindering them from becoming fully adapted to their environments. In addition,
poorly adapted transitional forms would be produced. If a barrier arose to prevent this
interbreeding, it would be advantageous to both stocks, since it would enable them to
become more perfectly adapted. In this case a period of rapid evolution would take
place; and the parent stocks, connected by transitional forms, would be replaced by
two species which were completely separate from one another. The setting up of such
