tional to the observed amplitude, and this may well be too low on account of non-ideal experimental con-
ditions, the estimate could easily be too high; it might also be too high on account of inadequacy of the
theoretical formula. A reasonable guess is m,/ms = 0-1 and this leads to the values given in the table; m,/mp is
directly proportional to, and the other figures inversely proportional to the square root of the assumed value
of (m,/ms). Hg: direction of H relative to the crystal axes not reliably known. ‘


DE HAAS-van ALPHEN EFFECT 55

where m’ is as introduced in equation (2) (see also equations (9) and (21)), V is the atomic
volume, N Avogadro’s number and the summation is over all the relevant ellipsoids. It
can be seen that n is always small and there are several lines of evidence which confirm that
it is in fact only part of the free electrons which effectively contribute to the de Haas-van
Alphen effect. The evidence from the steady susceptibility has already been discussed, and
other evidence comes from the anomalous skin effect (Pippard 1947; Chambers 1950)
which suggests that for tin 7 is of order one electron of normal mass per atom, from the Hall
effect, which, except for bismuth and antimony, indicates that for most metals the numbers
of electrons and ‘holes’ are not very much less than one per atom, and from the electronic
specific heat. The electronic specific heat per atom is given by

N provided T’< T, (Ty is E,/k); ifn and T, have values such as shown in table 14, ¢ comes
8 out of order at least 100 times smaller than if n is taken as one electron of normal mass
2 per atom (this gives JT) ~ 104 to 10°° K), while the experimental values of ¢ usually agree
