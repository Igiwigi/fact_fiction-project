unnecessary to particularize. There may be two or three acting points between the
electrodes, determining the current in opposite directions, or assisting each other,
the action upon the needle being the result of a dilferential, or ofa combined current,
according to circumstances. :

Shall we be justified in referring the effects observed in experiments 2, 3, 4, 5, 7

250 MR. H, F. BAXTER'S EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY AS TO THE EXISTENCE

and 8 to the same cause? Let us take the simple fact, that, when the mucous mem-
brane of the small intestine and the blood flowing from it are formed into a circuit,
a deviation of the needle amounting to 3*, 4* or 5* is obtained, the intestine being
empty and therefore uninfluenced by the cireumstances we have just now mentioned ;
why did the effect not occur in experiment 11? the conditions appeared to be pre-
cisely similar; or in experiments 7 and 10, when the artery was wounded; or in expe-
riments 3 and 4, when blood flowing from a different part formed the circuit; or in
experiments 3, 5, 9, when a circuit was formed between the inside and outside of the
gut? Did not the failure arise in these instances in consequence of the absence of
one necessary condition, the flowing of the blood from the same part, the transmis-
sion of the carrying particles from one electrode to the other, as shown in experi-
ments 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7?
