The following 'Table gives the mean results of a series of
measurements of the thicknesses of these compound wedges in a very large stem,
beginning with those in which each wedge consists of a single linear series of vessels,
and ascending to those in which I have found as many as thirteen. Number of lamine in Entire thickness Aean thickness of the

E The second column of figures shows that as the wedges increased in size there was a
-Zoradual diminution in the thickness of their component lamine—the result partly of
=their mutual pressure impeding the expansion of the vessels to their normal dimensions,
nd partly of the fact that these larger wedges contain more than the average of young
*Slaminee which have been intercalated, and which may not have reached their full
Zdevelopment. In young stems we find that the dimensions of the wedges are somewhat,
Zlarger than those recorded in the above Table. S On tracing these wedges in such sections as Plate XXII. fig. 3, from their medullary to
Stheir peripheral margins, we find that many of them consist of a single lamina of vessels
Wiironghout their entire course ; but such limited examples rarely, if ever, occur in the
Slarger stems.
