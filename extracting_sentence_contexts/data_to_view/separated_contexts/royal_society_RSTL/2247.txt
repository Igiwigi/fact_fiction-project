When the circumstances connected with the production of electricity in the
ordinary voltaic circuit are examined and compared, it appears that the source of that
agent, always meaning the electricity which circulates and completes the current in
the yoltaic apparatus, and gives that apparatus power and character (947. 996.), exists
in the chemical action which takes place directly between the metal and the body with
which it combines, and not at all in the subsequent action of the substance $0 pro-
duced with the acid present*. Thus, when zinc, platina, and dilute sulphurie acid are
used, it is the union of the zine with the oxygen of the water which determines the
current ; and though the acid is essential to the remoyal of the oxide 80 formed, in
order that another portion of zinc may act on another portion of water, it does not,
by combination with that oxide, produce any sensible portion of the current of elec-
tricity which circulates ; for the quantity of electricity is dependent upon the quantity
of zinc oxidized, and in definite proportion to it: its intensity is in proportion to the
intensity of the chemical affinity of the zine for the oxygen under the circumstances,
and is scarcely, if at all, affected by the use of either strong or weak acid (908.).

920. Again, if zinc, platina, and muriatic acid are used, the electricity appears to
be dependent upon the affinity of the zine for the chlorine, and to be circulated in
exact proportion to the number of particles of zinc and chlorine which unite, being
in fact an equivalent to them.

921. But in considering this oxidation, or other direct action upon the METAL itself,
as the canse and source of the electric current, it is of the utmost importance to
observe that the oxygen or other body must be in a peculiar condition, namely, in the
state of combination ; and not only s0, but limited still further, to such a state of com-
bination, and in 8uch proportions as will constitute an electrolyte (823.). A pair of
zinc and platina plates cannot be 80 arranged in oxygen gas as to produce a current
of electricity, or act as a voltaic circle, even though the temperature may be raised 80
highly as to cause oxidation of the zinc far more rapidly than if the pair of plates
were plunged into dilute sulphuric acid, for the oxygen is not part of an electrolyte,
and cannot therefore conduct the forces onwards by decomposition, or even as metals
do by itself.
