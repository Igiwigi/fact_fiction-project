The nonlinear electronic circuits considered in [37,43] were Chua circuits, which are highly
versatile and controllable, in particular they can be tuned to a Hopf bifurcation giving rise to self-
oscillations. Clearly, these systems are zero-dimensional in space; hence, in those experiments,
only the phase-bistable response associated to rocking was demonstrated, both under periodic
rocking [43] and under random rocking [37]. The fact rocking shows its effectiveness in systems
as diverse as optical and electronic evidences its universality. From the theoretical side, rocking has been investigated in PRO models under temporal
[41] and (small aspect ratio) spatial [42] rocking. Two-level laser models have been studied as


well: temporal rocking in zero-dimensional class B lasers was considered in [44], spatial rocking
in small aspect ratio lasers (with just two transverse modes) was studied in [45], and zero-
dimensional bidirectional lasers under temporal rocking were investigated in [46].
