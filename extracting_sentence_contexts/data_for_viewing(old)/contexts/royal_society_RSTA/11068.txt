fig. 24 for convenience of reference and to help the reader to interpret correctly the
first and second figures of the present series). The point of departure at which the
liquid left the sphere is well marked, and a tangent from this point passes through
the outermost conspicuous droplets that must have been projected from it.

In fig. 2 the sphere was dusted at the top and on the right-hand side, but not much
more than halfway down, and the configuration corresponds entirely to the facts.
Here again a tangent from the well marked drops on the right-hand side leads very
nearly to the place of departure from the surface of the sphere.

In fig. 3 on this page the record is that the sphere was dusty at the top only. It
is to be expected that dusting at the top will not make much difference in the flow of
the already converging liquid. Comparison with fig. 7 of Series XTIT., Plate 3 shows,
however, that a slight effect has been produced.
