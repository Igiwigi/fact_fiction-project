pots, and their lower edges are produced into strong projecting spines.


102 MR. W. K. BROOKS ON LUCITFER :

The telson is deeply cleft, and its halves diverge from each other like a s8wallow's
tail feathers, so that the posterior ends of the rudimentary swimmerets are visible
between them in a dorsal view, as shown in figs. 77, 78, and 79, The spines on the
telson are similar in arrangement to those of Lncifer, bub much longer.

A comparison of the Tncifer Zoza (fig. 44), the Acetes Zota (fig. 79), and the
Sergestes Zota (CLavs's *Orustacean-System,' taf. vi., fig. 1) at the same stage of deyelop-
ment, brings out the extremely interesting fact that the Acetes larva stands between
the very simple Zo#a of Lucifer and the remarkably complicated Flaphocaris larya of
Sergestes in nearly every feature in which the two differ. In Lucifer the eyes are
8exsile ; in Acetes they have short stalks ; and in Sergestes the stalks are very long.

In Lucifer the spines over the eyes are absent ; in Acetes they are present and
simple ; and in Sergestes they are very long and compound.

In Lucifer the postero-lateral spines are parallel to the long axis of the body ; in
Acetes they are oblique, s0 that they project a little beyond the outline of the body ;
and in Sergestes they are at right angles to the long axis, and compound.

The carapace, including the rostrum, makes about one-third of the total length of the
