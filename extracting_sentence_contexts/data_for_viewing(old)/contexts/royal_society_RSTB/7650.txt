Sberatids from the famous occurrence of the Humphriesianum Zone near Geraldton in
Western Australia, from which Buckman identified the genus (Crick 1894). A map showing
Ethis remarkable distribution has been published (Arkell 1949) ; the present occurrence was
gunknown when the map went to press, and should be added.
& Notwithstanding the absence of the almost ubiquitous Stephanoceras, the Arabian

Abeing unknown outside Arabia and Sinai, correlation depends on the associated genera.
The only links with Europe or elsewhere yet found with the Ermoceras fauna in Arabia
are the three Stephanoceratids, Stephanoceras cf. psilacanthus Wermbter, Teloceras cf. labrum
Buckman, Normannites cf. orbignyi Buckman. All three indicate the Humphriesianum Zone,
and more especially the highest subzone (Blagdeni). This fact and the absence of Streno-
ceras, Garantiana, or Parkinsonia, infallible indices of the Upper Bajocian all over the world,
at first led me to assume the age of the Ermoceras fauna to be highest Middle Bajocian.
In Sinai there is considerably more evidence. H. Douvillé (1916, p. 9-10) recognized
three subdivisions of his Bajocian, but recorded species of Ermoceras from both the highest
and the lowest, so that for our purpose all three can be considered together. He made no

suggestions as to correlation with any particular part of the Bajocian. Besides Arabian
ammonites already discussed, and a few others not yet found in Arabia or anywhere
else, Douvillé figured the following species from the Bajocian of Gebel Maghara, Sinai. I
