Throughout the greater portion
S of their extent they are cylindrical, and have their surfaces ornamented with numerous
> longitudinal ridges and interyening sulci. At their bases, where they are depressed
2 vertically, the ridges terminate in rows of small tubercles, like those which stud the
Â© snrface of the scale. Z The internal structure of this spine is highly interesting, partly from the fact that
= it is merely one of the ordinary scales in which the superficial element is dispropor-
S tionally developed and drawn out longitudinally, and partly because it explains the
B= true nature of some well-known fossil ichthyolites. It contains a hollow pulp(?)-
6 cavity, which exhibits no appearance of having been occupied by a cellular pulp, but
S is partly filled by a membrane composed of reticulated fibres, like those found in the
5 ordinary scales. Around this is placed the calcareous portion of the spine, which
= wholly consists of kosmine, and includes the homologues both of the horizontal canals,

206, and of the more superficial tubuli, 20 a.
