It cannot be said that spectroscopy has
already passed from the descriptive to the rational state. We do not propose to discuss
in detail the bearing of our results on the application of the quantum theory to the origin
of spectra, but attention may be drawn to certain considerations. It would appear
from the well-known relation Ve = hy that the distribution of intensity in a spectrum
should be a simple function of the distribution of velocity among the electrons in the
discharge tube, but this view appears to be negatived by the fact that different series
behave in different ways, and we may probably conclude from this that the range of
velocities of the electrons is not the sole factor which determines the emission in line
spectra ; this view appears to be strengthened by such phenomena as the apparently
anomalous effect of Neon on the distribution of intensity in the Balmer series.*

As regards the Balmer series, the separations of the components which we have
found indicate that it is of the Principal type, and lend no direct support to the
theoretical considerations advanced by SommeRFELD. In any case it can no longer be
regarded as a Diffuse or Sharp series. We do not venture to speculate further on the results we have obtained, which can
only be regarded as preliminary in their scope, but we hope that the methods of
investigation which we have outlined may lead to the detailed knowledge which must
be essential to the further elucidation of spectrum series.
