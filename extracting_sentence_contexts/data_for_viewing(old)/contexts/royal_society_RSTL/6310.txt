To do this, the discriminant is represented, not as above in terms of the constants
B, y, 3, but in a somewhat different form, by means of the constants 6, c, d, the last two


THE IN-AND-CIRCUMSCRIBED POLYGON. 227

whereof are 8uch that e=0 is the relation for the triangle, d=0 the relation for the
quadrangle ; thus [3]=e, [4]=d, and for the particular cases considered, the analytical
theorem consists herein, that c is a factor of (6), and of (9), and that d is a factor of (8).
T have, for the sake of homogeneity, introduced into the formulz the quantity @ (=1),
but this is a matter of form only,

The functions [3], [4], &c. have been spoken of as prime; they are 0, in fact, as far
as they are calculated ; and that they are 80 in general rests on the assumption that for
a polygon of a given number of sides, there is but one form of relation: if, for instance,
in the equation [12]=0, which is the condition for a proper dodecagon, the function
[12] could be decomposed into rational factors; then equating each of these factors to
Zero, we should have 80 many distinct forms of relation for a proper dodecagon. T

elieve that the assumption and reasoning are valid; but without entering further into

is, I take it for granted that in the general case the functions [3], [4], &e. are in fact

rime. But the coefficients Ã¾, y, 3, or 6, c, d, instead of being 80 many independent
Sibitrary quantities, may be given as rational functions of other quantities (if, for
