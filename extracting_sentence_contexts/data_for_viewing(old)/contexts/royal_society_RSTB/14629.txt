tually, however, all the bees that forage outside of the colony
switch to feeding on complex flowers.

(c) Colony size

Everything else being equal, the total number of bees in the
colony does not affect the timing of the transition to foraging
on complex flowers (figure 3). This reflects that, in the model,
we explicitly took into account a balance between two oppos-
ing processes: larger colonies have more workers that are
available to visit complex flowers, but also need more food
to maintain a positive energy budget (favouring visits to
simple flowers). This is also due to the fact that the model
is linear, which means that potential interactions between
bees are explicitly not considered. With the default parameter
values, the model predicts all bees in the colony to shift to
complex flowers at time step 22, regardless of colony size.
For small colonies, the model predicts the bees’ optimal pro-
portions of foraging time on simple and complex flowers,
rather than the optimal number of foragers on each flower
type. This would be the case, for example, if there is only
one bee in the colony (equivalent to a solitary bee).
