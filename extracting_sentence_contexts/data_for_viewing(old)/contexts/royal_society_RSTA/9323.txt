out here. The first is that, commencing quite sharply at a distance from the centre
corresponding to just over 5 A.U., the whole system of spots appears to be overlaid by
a broad halo. The lengthy exposure required for good hair photographs is an indication
that only a fraction of the hair substance is in a true, or approximately true, crystalline
state, and what we know of “ amorphous ” X-ray halos would lead us to expect a diffuse
reflection of the kind observed. Amorphous halos tend to reveal the ‘* most probable ”’
inter- or intra-molecular distances in a non-crystalline system ; and the non-crystalline
fraction of the hair substance, being built of combinations of «-amino acids which must
have certain relatively small spacings in common, would naturally yield such a halo.
In addition, the effect will be further enhanced by a certain proportion of matter, in
heterogeneous orientation, corresponding to the aligned crystallites which give rise to
the «-photograph described above. ‘That there actually is some crystalline protein in
random orientation is shown by the fact that in several of the photographs obtained a
weak ‘‘ powder ring” can be traced passing through (001).

The second of the additional points of interest mentioned above is that, in photo-
graphs of the fine animal hairs. such as Merino wool, much of the centre is obscured by
another halo of high “ spacing.” Plate 2, fig. 3, shows this effect well ; in fact, in Merino
photographs, the (100) spots cannot be observed on this account. The effect is less
obvious in Cotswold wool and practically non-existent in human hair and porcupine
