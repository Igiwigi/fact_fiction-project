This is precisely what the French
'S experimenters found it to be. © Through a glass trough 0-08 of a meter in length,
= and full of water, the rays on the Rigi passed in the proportion of 685, and at Lucerne
& in the proportion of 730, per 1,000 of the incident heat.” Z  Macxvs was 80 convinced of the impotency of aqueous vapour to arrest radiant
£ heat, that in reference to various meteorological phenomena, where the action I had
ascribed to it offered a satisfactory explanation of the facts, he put in its place mis or
