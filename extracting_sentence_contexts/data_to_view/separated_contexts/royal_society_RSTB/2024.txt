The leaf must have been very large ; in
one slide a rachis (probably of a primary pinna) can be traced in longitudinal section
for fully 5 inches, apparently without branching. In other cases branching is shown. The facts just detailed show that Medullosa anglica bore large, highly compound
leaves, the petioles of which have the structure of the Myeloxylon Landriotii of
Renavtt. The latter is not to be regarded as a species in the same sense as in

* In another section a small rachis, like that shown in fig. 16, is seen arising as a branch from one of
larger dimensions.
