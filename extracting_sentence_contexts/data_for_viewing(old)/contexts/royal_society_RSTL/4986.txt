and are besides to be converted into pendulums, each oscillating on a knife-edge placed
where it makes the time of vibration a minimum. If the period of vibration of the
same bar at the same place is unchanged by time, gravity being supposed unchanged,
then the whole length of the bar is unchanged ; and the distance of the divisions marked
on it, 8upposing the bar to continue straight, is unchanged. The bar must of course be
guaranteed from rust or change of shape. As the test of actual length is required to
be very. exact, the series of experiments should be continued without interruption as
long as possible. I have therefore had an apparatus constructed for swinging these
pendulums #9 vacuo, which, so far as I can judge, will give almost any degree of accuracy
to this part of the inquiry, with very little trouble to the observer ; this was in fact my
first step, and until this was secured I did not think it worth while to apply myself to
the rest of the apparatus.

** The next point is, the very accurate comparison of two bars with each other, the
bars being supposed of the same material. Connected with this is, the determination of
the law of expansion of the metal that may be used, at usnal and moderate temperatures.
The preparations for this apparently simple operation will perhaps appear complicated.
I should however be unwilling to give up any of them; 80 important do I hold this
solidity of the apparatus to be.

< The real difficulties in the practical problem have been, 80 far as I can judge, the
instability of the optical beam compass employed, the unsatisfactory mode of supporting
