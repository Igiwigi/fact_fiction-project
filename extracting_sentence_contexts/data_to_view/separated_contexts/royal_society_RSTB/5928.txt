Ostrichâ€”The ostrich is represented by numerous pieces of eggshell (Struthiolithus)
chiefly occurring in the cultural layers, and is the only interesting bird recognized in
Choukoutien. As to the palwontological significance of the foregoing assemblage, the conclusion
is obvious. In full accordance with the known stratigraphical facts, the Choukoutien
fauna fits so exactly between the Late Pliocene (Nihowan) and the Upper Pleistocene
Loessic (Sjara-osso-gol) ages that it is not easy to decide to which of them it stands the
more closely related. Consequently the Choukoutien formation has broadly to be
considered as of Lower Pleistocene age. AND ENVIRONMENT OF SINANTHROPUS PEKINENSIS.
