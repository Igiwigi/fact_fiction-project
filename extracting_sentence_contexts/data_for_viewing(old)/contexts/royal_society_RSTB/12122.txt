plant secondary metabolism and help find new active natural
products. For example, in Catharanthus roseus the nitrate/
peptide family (NPF) transporter CrNPF2.9 plays a key role
in the monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis by exporting
the cytotoxic intermediate strictosidine from the vacuole;
silencing of CrNPF2.9 induced the strictosidine accumulation
and subsequently caused the extensive tissue death [31].

In cotton plants the gossypol pathway intermediate C234
was undetectable both before and after R. solani inoculation,
although at the same time other intermediates were induced
to accumulate by the pathogen (figure 1b,c). This is consistent
with the fact that the P450 monooxygenase CYP71BE79 is
catalytically highly efficient in transforming C234 into
8,11-dihydroxy-7-keto-8-cadinene, and its maximum activity
is more than ten times higher than that of the other identi-
fied enzymes of the gossypol pathway [13]. Although
other gossypol pathway intermediates may also contain the

a,B-unsaturated carbonyl, to date only C234 is found to
have the activity in enhancing pathogen susceptibility, prob-
ably owing to its specific structure. The toxicity of C234 may
have exerted a selection pressure on the regulation of gossy-
pol biosynthesis, and cotton plants have evolved a highly
active P450 enzyme to prevent the accumulation of the
