312 MR. W. BATESON ON SOME VARIATIONS OF CARDIUM EDULE

These shells are nearly all of the very large and thick type spoken of above (wde
p. 809) as “ great shells.” From the great abundance of shells of this type in the
deposits below the present bed of Abu Kir, it seems clear that they were numerous in
the locality for a long period, As they are entirely absent among the shells now
lying on the shores of the lake (namely, those which were the last inhabitants), I
would suggest that these “great shells” perhaps lived there in the period when the
sea communicated with the lake. This becomes still more probable in connection with
the fact of the occurrence of similar shells at Jaksi Klich, Jaman Klich, and on the
flats between them and Shumish Kul, for at the time when these localities were
under water and connected with the Aral Sea the conditions in them could not have
been very different from those prevailing in the lagoon of Abu Kir when it was open
to the Mediterranean. The shells, then, of Abu Kir are of two kinds :—

(1.) Shells of animals lately extinct, which lived in a lagoon of water having a
specific gravity of about 1:05; these shells show the same variations from the
“normal ” type as those of the Aral district living under similar circumstances.

(2.) “Great shells” occurring in a more or less definite bed below the level of the
present lagoon, the origin of which is uncertain, but which were probably living when
the lagoon was open to the sea.
