Subsequently, pressure was renewed and gave rise to the broken folds of Charlton
Hill and Rushton, and the upthrust of the Wrekin mass with the steep south-easterly
tilt of the Cambrian quartzite on its south-eastern side and the brecciation of the
quartzite on its north-western flank close to the Wrekin Fault.

This movement took place at various periods, but its greatest intensity was reached
in post-Caradoc, pre-Silurian times; that some of the movement was post-Lower
Carboniferous in age is suggested by the high dip of the Carboniferous Limestone of
the Little Wenlock area, along its scarp facing the Wrekin.

The existence of a resistant floor of Rushton Schist and Uriconian rocks is probably
responsible for the fact that the Cambrian rocks are free from complex folding. This
resistant floor has yielded to pressure by breaking into blocks and lenses which have
moved relatively to one another in an approximately horizontal direction without
much vertical displacement. The lateral displacement of these masses involved the
overlying Cambrian beds. That the movement has been in the main horizontal is
indicated by the direction of slickensides on fault and joint surfaces at many points
in the area ; especially in Charlton Hill Quarry.

Assuming horizontal movement along the faults to have taken place, we may dissect
the map of the Charlton Hill area and, by aligning the various sections of the Cambrian
quartzite, arrive at a plan of the ground as it might have existed before the post-
Cambrian faulting took place, fig. 5.
