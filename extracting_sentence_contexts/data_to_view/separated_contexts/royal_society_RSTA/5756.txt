Hence, it eventually became (under the
influence of Hawking & Ellis [14] and Geroch [20]) the standard characterization of singularities
proven by the singularity theorems. Usually, only time-like or null curves are used, but in
principle also incomplete space-like curves define singularities. Moreover, the curves should
not need to be geodesic, and as a matter of fact there are known examples [20] of geodesically
complete space-times with incomplete time-like curves of everywhere bounded acceleration. It
must be remarked, however, that all singularity theorems to date prove merely the existence of
geodesic incompleteness, which of course is sufficient proof of incompleteness.

(b) Trapped spheres

The concept of closed trapped surface, in short trapped sphere if the surface has S? topology,
was a genius idea that characterizes the ‘point of no return’ in stellar gravitational collapse and
actually changed the path of GR for ever more. In GR gravity is described by the geometry of space-time.
