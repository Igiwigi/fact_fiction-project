15t, That the eye has a power of adjusting itself to different
distances when deprived of the crystalline lens; and therefore
the fibrous and laminated structure of that lens is not in-
tended to alter its form, but to prevent reflections in the pas-
sage of the rays through the surfaces of media of different
densities, and to correct spherical aberration.

2d, That the cornea is made up of lamine; that it is elas-
tic, and when stretched, is capable of being elongated 7+ part
of its diameter, contracting to its former length immediately
upon being left to itself. gd, That the tendons of the four straight muscles of the eye

are continued on to the edge of the cornea, and terminate, or
are inserted, in its external lamina; their action will therefore
extend to the edge of the cornea,

4th, That in changing the focus of the eye from seeing with
parallel rays to a near distance, there is a visible alteration
produced in the figure of the cornea, rendering it more con-
vex; and when the eye is again adapted to parallel rays, the
alteration by which the cornea is brought back to its former
state is equally visible. Having supported these facts by the evidence of anatomical
structure, and absolute demonstration, I shall consider them to
be established ; and make some observations upon the muscular
and elastic power by which so very curious an.effect as the ad-
justment of the eye is produced. The four straight muscles of the eye are attached to the bot-
tom of the bony orbit near the foramen opticum ; they become
broader as they pass forward, and when arrived at the anterior
part of the eye-ball, are insensibly changed for tendons ; these
adhere to the sclerotic coat, and terminate in the external
lamina of the cornea, which appears to be a continuation of
them. When we consider the situation of these muscles, it is evi-
dent that their action will produce three very different effects
upon the eye, according to circumstances.
