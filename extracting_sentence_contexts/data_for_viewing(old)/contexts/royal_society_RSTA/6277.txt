limsup [ fo wm drdts [ fo 7 dx adt + a (3.50)

Since k > \o loo is arbitrary, (3.50) gives convergence of norms, which combined with (3.46)
implies the strong convergence (3.45). Finally, let us recall that T* can be chosen arbitrarily close
to T. In addition, we can a priori construct the solution on the time interval (0,2T). Consequently,
T* can be chosen bigger than T, and so we obtain (3.45) with T* replaced by T.

(iii) Limit in the entropy equality

Let us analyze the limit of (3.24) as n > +00 for each term. The strong convergence of #” and
V0", see (3.14) and (3.33), implies that n” > n and Vn" > Vn a.e. in Q. Thanks to the definition of
n", and the a priori bound (3.8), we obtain a uniform bound for ||7"||L"(q) for any 1 € (1, +00) and
for || Vn" ||,2(Q)- These facts, the Vitali convergence theorem and (3.2) allow us, up to subsequence,
to easily pass to the limit on the left-hand side of (3.24).

To pass to the limit also in terms on the right-hand side, we use (3.10), (3.11), (3.14), (3.23)
and (3.45) combined with the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem and together with the
minimum principle for 0". Consequently, n satisfies entropy equation (2.11).


(c) Continuity of 2 in time

Finally, we focus on the attainment of initial conditions and continuity with respect to
time variable. Concerning the velocity field, we can recall (3.10) and by standard parabolic
interpolation, we observe v € C([0, TI; LG, div): The fact that v(0) = vo is then proven analogously
