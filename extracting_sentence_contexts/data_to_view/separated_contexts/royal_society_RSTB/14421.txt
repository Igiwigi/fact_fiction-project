We used multinomial models to estimate the overall pre-
dicted probabilities of coalitions by females only, males only
or both sexes. Contrary to our first prediction, female-only
coalitions were not more likely than male-only coalitions
(figure 1, Model 1). In fact, the probability of female-only
coalitions in a typical mammal (median = 0.18, 90% credible
interval = 0.01-0.47) was lower than the probability of male-
only coalitions (0.33, 0.04-0.67) and the most likely state
was coalitions by both sexes (0.41, 0.14-0.68). Thus, only
34% of the posterior probability supported our prediction
of female-only coalitions being more likely than male-only
coalitions. The phylogenetic signal was moderate (median
A=0.34, 90% Cl =0.14-0.54).
