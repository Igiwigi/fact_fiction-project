â€˜The possible significance of these exceptions where there is
diminution of a south deflection, is indicated by the fact that a similar diminution
can sometimes be demonstrated by using stimulation of excessive strength (fig. 38). Whether this diminution is to be regarded as a more profound effect of CO, in larger
quantity, or as a fatigue effect, must be left an open question. The fact that the
exceptional result may appear in the form of an augmented north deflection seems to
be opposed to the latter alternative, and the key to these, in any case infrequent,
peculiarities will probably be found in the peculiar differences of action of CO, in

various quantities upon the deflection and after-deflection of nerve in various states ;
905 exhibits this exceptional effect on a north variation, 912 on a south variation,
and 2068 exhibits the dependence of the latter upon strength of tetanisation.
