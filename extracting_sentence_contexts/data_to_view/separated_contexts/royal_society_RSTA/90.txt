(Added September 23, 1886.) The late Joun ALLAN Brouy, in discussing the Trevandrum observations for the
ten years 1854 to 1864, came to the conclusion that in the lunar diurnal variations of
declination in each month of the year the amount of movement is, as in the solar
diurnal variation, greater during the day than during the night; and the writer of
this paper has shown in it that in each of four seasons of the year the same holds at
Bombay with respect both to the declination and horizontal force. Whilst admitting,
however, that Broun has priority of publication of this fact as regards the declination
at Trevandrum, the writer avers that he has in no way been guided by Broun’s
previous investigation, nor was he aware of the existence of Broun’s paper * when
he made the discovery with respect to the declination at Bombay. Moreover, the
writer’s line of investigation was that of Sabrne, modified: by himself, and not that of
Broun; and an account of the first results of its employment was read before the
Royal Society on the Ist February, 1872, a date antecedent to the reading of Broun’s
paper before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, which did not take place till the
6th May, 1872.
