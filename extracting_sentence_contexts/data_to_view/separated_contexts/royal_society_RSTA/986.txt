Before :s
analysing the structure of the inhomogeneous rod let us consider what it means to be in the :
quasi-static regime of a viscoelastic material that has been subjected to finite deformation. For
convenience, we do not append a hat to time varying variables in this section as we have done
above, because we are not envisaging taking Fourier transforms of these variables - they are
associated with the large deformation problem.

(a) Quasi-static deformations

We shall study nonlinear viscoelastic media that behave in a manner described by the QLV

theory [40,45,71]. The general constitutive expression for anisotropic media takes the form

aTT®(s)
ds

t
TT’(t) =| G(t—s): ds, (4.1)
00

where TT is the second Piola—Kirchhoff stress with superscripts ‘ve’ and ‘e’ referring to the
viscoelastic and elastic stresses, respectively, and G is a fourth-order reduced relaxation tensor,
where reduced refers to the fact that it is non-dimensional, unlike the relaxation tensor in linear
viscoelasticity, which has dimensions of stress, see e.g. (2.3). The stress T° is the (instantaneous)
elastic stress, derived from a strain energy W as is standard in nonlinear elasticity. The form
prescribed in (4.1) preserves objectivity and provides a balance between realistic modelling and
ease of implementation in computational simulations.
