Other observers, Brunn (16), K6nniker (17) and Braun (18), have shown that the
medullary parts of the suprarenals are derived from the sympathetic, the cortical parts
from undifferentiated mesoderm. Scuenck and Brrpseit (14), working with Chick, Dog, and Human embryos,
came to the conclusion that the ganglia are derivatives of the central nervous system,
and are pushed out from the spinal ganglia. Their paper is not, however, convincing ;
the illustrations do not clearly express the meaning of the text ; and the facts adduced
do not appear to justify the generalisations at which they arrive. Onopt (15) has given the most complete account of the development of the sympa-
thetic. His researches cover all the classes of vertebrates.
