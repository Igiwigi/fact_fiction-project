comparison of the thermograph with the photograph, and I am inclined to believe that
the firs method gives a result which should be fairly accurate though it omits Â« from
the thermograph. If H be taken as known, and if the fiducial line yy y be correct, the limit of the
spectrum would be beyond e; but it is hard to reconeile this with the fact that the
centre of the last red image of the sun seen through cobalt glass would be near (! otherwise the absorptions shown in the photograph would agree with the breaks of
continuity in the thermograph. Theoretical deductions.
