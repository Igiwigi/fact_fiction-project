mental tube itself, the displacement between dry and humid air being effected in the open
atmosphere. The experiments are all perfectly concurrent as regards the action of the
'aqueous vapour upon radiant heat.


8 PROFESSOR TYNDALL ON THE RELATION

The power of aqueous vapour being thus established, meteorologists may, T think,
apply the result without fear. That 10 per cent. of the entire terrestrial radiation is
absorbed by the aqueous yapour which exists within ten feet of the earth's surface on
a day of average humidity, is a moderate estimate. In warm weather and air approach-
ing to saturation, the absorption would probably be considerably greater. 'This single
fact at once suggests the importance of the established action as regards meteorology.
I am persuaded that by means of it many difficulties will be solved, and many familiar
effects, which we pass over without sufficient scrutiny because they are familiar, will
have a novel interest, attached to them by their connexion with the action of aqueous
vapour on radiant heat. While leaving these applications to be made in all their
fullness by meteorologists, I would refer, by way of illustration, to one or two points
on which I think the experiments bear.

And first it is to be remarked that the vapour which absorbs heat thus greedily
radiates it very copiously. This fact must, T think, come powerfully into play in the
tropical region of calms, where enormous quantities of yapour are raised by the sun, and
discharged in deluges upon the earth. This has been assigned to the chilling conse-
quent on the rarefaction of the ascending air. But if we consider the amount of heat
