BULLOUGH ON THE

birds have not been examined, the preponderance of males over females in that country
does not appear to be so extreme. Brouwer (1929) found a proportion of 159 males to
146 females, and van Dobben (see Kluijver 1935) a proportion of 166 males to 124 females. An excess of males over females appears therefore to be a feature of starling populations,
and the fact that the first-year males do not normally breed whereas the first-year females
do, helps to restore the balance between the sexes. Perhaps also one sex has a greater
expectation of breeding life than the other, although this would be difficult to prove. Hicks (1934), again referring to the starling in the United States of America where a great
amount of ringing of the species has been done, states that few of the 5- and 6-year-old
birds which he has handled had yellow beaks.
