This suggests that carriers trapping is indeed involved behind the [3
ODMR process of Nis defect. We note that the reported negative ODMR contrast of the 2.56 eV PL [8
in [23] was about 10~° in their experimental conditions (excitation wavelength of 365 nm applied : Ss
in 36.2GHz microwave cavity), which showed up as a positive contrast without reporting its 8
magnitude in [24] in their experimental conditions (excitation wavelength of 325 nm applied in ‘Ss

35 GHz microwave cavity). This fact also implies that the ODMR process is not intrinsic to the Nis
defect alone. Photo-EPR measurements were carried out in nickel doped diamonds and found
that the intensity of W8 EPR signal decreases by photo-excitation with approximately 2.5eV
threshold energy which can be reinstated by photo-excitation with approximately 3.0 eV [26].

2. Methodology

We characterize Nis in diamond by plane wave supercell calculations within spin-polarized DFT
as implemented in the VASP 5.4.1 code [27].
