In males, spermatogen-
esis is an ongoing process throughout life. Therefore, fathers
have the possibility of affecting gene expression in offspring
in ways that benefit offspring. The fact that mammalian
semen is packed with small RNA molecules provides a
highly plausible mechanism by which they might achieve
this [24,47,48]. The importance of small RNA molecules in epigenetic
inheritance is perhaps best characterized in Caenorhabditis ele-
gans. Examples of transgenerational inheritance include
responses to pathogens such as Pseudomonas [49] and poss-
ibly viruses [50,51] that are propagated over generations.
