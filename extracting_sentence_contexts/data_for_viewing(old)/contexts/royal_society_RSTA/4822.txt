be seen as classical interactions in the automaton.° The difficulty is further exacerbated by the
fact that the procedure is not Lorentz invariant by construction; indeed, making the discretized
cellular automaton Lorentz invariant is rather difficult, and this difficulty shows up when we try
to include the string interactions.

This difficulty is also related to the question of background dependence. Our model, as yet,
is assumed to have a flat background. It is this flat background that then takes the form of a
rectangular lattice. Any interaction in the string would lead to gravitons interacting with it, and
these in turn would generate curvature in the background. One may suspect what all this means
physically: the lattice will feature local lattice defects of various forms; the strings may merge
with defect lines in some delicate manner, but all this has not been sorted out.

What we did find is one rather astonishing fact, which seems to have been overlooked by
string theoreticians: the lattice size parameter a is fixed in our theory. There is only one lattice size
possible. It is exactly

{space-time = Qnva', (5.5)
where a’ is the string slope parameter.

5We do note that the situation is not hopeless: the longitudinal string variables that need to coincide refer to points inside
the string world sheet. Where exactly the strings meet inside their world sheet may perhaps be considered as ‘unimportant’.
Incorporating diffeomorphisms on the world sheet might conceivably resolve the difficulties.


Even if we do not know how exactly to deal with the string interactions, the above discussion
