[Zical characters and in the composition, deduced from an imperfect analysis made in
1 laboratory of the Ecole des Mines, as to justify my distinguishing it under the name
fAontebrasite F.
Afterwards, towards the close of 1871, I received from M. MoissgEXET another
pzcimen coming from Montebras, which presented all the characters of the American
\gblygonite, and which consequently was easily distinguished from the Montebrasite, as
owed in my notice read to the Academy on Nov. 27, 1871.
Subsequently to the publication of this note, the analyses made by PisAnt (Comptes
ndus des Seances de VAcademie des Sciences, s6ance du 26 D&ec. 1871, tom. Ixxiii.
81479), by KoBBELL (Sitzungsberichte der bayerischen Acad. der Wiss., Feb. 3, 1872),
by RAMMELSBERG (Berichte der deutschen Chem. Gesellsch. Berlin, 26 Feb. 1872,
No. 3, p. 78) proved the identity, in point of chemical composition, of the Montebrasite
f Montebras and the Amblygonite from near Penig. This identity ought in fact to
2xist in the Saxon variety, for I have lately satisfied myself that a plate cut from a Penig
Specimen, in a direction, as nearly as might be, perpendicular to the two principal
leayages, presents the same optical characters as do plates cut from some specimens
from Montebras, which will be discussed presently. But this is not the case with
