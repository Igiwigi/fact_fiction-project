uniformly decreasing value of the anisotropy factor equation (1.1) as ; increases.

Vasquez et al. [57] ran 3D PIC hybrid simulations of freely decaying turbulence initiated
with anisotropic Alfvénic fluctuations at kc/wpi <1 in a plasma with 6; =0.10 for most runs.
The proton heating rate in these simulations scales as the initial fluctuation amplitude to the
power 3.2. The wavevector anisotropy tends to the characteristic k, >> kj, even for modestly
anisotropic initial conditions, with a scaling of the wavevector anisotropy factor (equation (1.1))
approximately proportional to B2 /\SB?. Gary [58] used equations (1.2) and (1.3) with Alfvén
wave kinetic linear dispersion equation solutions to argue that three-wave coupling processes
should favour the development of the characteristic k, >> kj; wavenumber anisotropy which


is in fact demonstrated in many of the simulations. Goldstein ef al. [44] summarize many
papers reporting observational studies of Alfvén and kinetic Alfvén wave dissipation in short-
wavelength turbulence in the solar wind.

(b) 71; > Ty; instabilities

Many papers describe hybrid simulations of the Alfvén-cyclotron and ion mirror instabilities
driven by an ion temperature anisotropy (e.g. [59] and references therein) in both 1D and
2D configurations, showing the exponential growth of field fluctuations to saturation and the
associated scattering of the anisotropic ions to yield the gradual reduction of T\;/T\j. Fewer
computations have displayed the temporal evolution of the fluctuating magnetic field spectra
in both ky and k, [60]. Hellinger et al. [61] used in-plane 2D PIC hybrid simulations and Shoji
et al. [62] used both 2D and 3D PIC simulations to examine the competition between these two
