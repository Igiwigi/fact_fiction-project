It follows that the total E.M.I. round the circuit with a steady

Surrent i is zero, or the work done in carrying a unit of positive electricity round the

wit with the current is zero. For work is required to move it against the E.M.T.
an the seab of energy, this work sending energy out into the medium, while an equal
Hnount of energy comes in in the rest of the circuit where it is moving with the E.M.T. Fhis mode of regarding the relations of the various parts of the circuit is, I am aware,
Dry different from that usually given, but it seems to me to give us a better account
#& the known facts. Z1t may 8eem at first 8ight that we ought to have new experimental indications of
is sort of movement of energy, if it really takes place. We should look for proofs at
ints where the energy is transformed into other modifications, that is, in conductors.
