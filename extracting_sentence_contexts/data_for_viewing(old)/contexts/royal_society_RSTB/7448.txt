and C. chloropyga compete for food in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often
insufficient food to go round, and this arises solely through the improvident manner in
which parent flies distribute their eggs.

An analogous case is seen among the slum dwellers of our great cities where the very poor
produce large families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce among such communi-
ties. It can hardly be said that children in these families ‘compete’ for the available food.
Yet they suffer from the shortage very much in the same way as do the overcrowded
progeny of the blowflies. Mortality is higher and the general size smaller than in better-fed
sections of humanity.

The problem, therefore, must be regarded as one of nutritional requirements and their
satisfaction or otherwise by the provisions of nature rather than in the light of a specific
‘struggle’. The phenomenon which really acts as the controlling agent is, basically, sheer
