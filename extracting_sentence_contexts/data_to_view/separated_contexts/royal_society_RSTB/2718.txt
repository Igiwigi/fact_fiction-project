An experienced breeder of Angus and Shorthorn cattle in Banffshire, in answer to a query regarding
the length of the dicstrous cycle in cows of those breeds, states that this interval varies from two to

succeed in getting served at an early cestrus. § Professor Ewart informs me that the duration of the sexual season (or the number of dicestrous
eycles in a season) with horses varies according to the character of the breed. Thus, in semi-wild ponies
