First may be that the
moonlight is reducing the activity of the insects, so that the active population
available to be sampled by the trap is smaller. Secondly, it is possible that the
light of the trap has to compete with the light of the moon and so is less efficient
and attracts insects from a smaller area. It is not at present possible to distinguish between these two alternatives with
certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably in their response from
other insects flying at the same time suggests the effect may be partly at least
physiological.

Further investigation is proceeding to settle this point by the use of traps not
dependent on light for their attractive power.
