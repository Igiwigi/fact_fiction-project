A physicist who believed that the size of the black hole at tp can be determined from the space—
time geometry in some neighbourhood of .#* at to would be faced with a dilemma. Somehow, :
the black hole would have to ‘know’ to be the right size at fo in order to anticipate the decay or =
non-decay of the atom, or alternatively the experimenter decision, at t;. The apparent dilemma 3
is compounded by the fact that the photons which propagate on .#* never interact with the
radioactive atom (or experimenter) at f;. To avoid requiring some implausible conspiracy, the nee)
physicist may conclude that there may be a retrocausal effect by which information, associated :
with the decay of the radioactive atom, propagates back in time causing the black hole event [4
horizon to expand at earlier times. DN

However, in this case, there is a simple explanation for the correlation which requires neither [sz
conspiracy nor retrocausality.
