GRAND CURRENTS OF ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION. 655

direction of the Sun’s diurnal relative motion through the sky from its rising in the
east to its setting in the west. He does not indicate any knowledge of the fact that
on the two sides of the Equator in tropical regions there are two Trade-Wind zones,
one on each side, in each of which the wind prevails from east to west, with an
accompanying motion in each case towards the Equator. We may, indeed, suppose, that such knowledge was only gradually acquired, chiefly
by mariners, and was but vaguely and imperfectly intercommunicated among them,
and was spread very little among others during a long period of time. I do not
suppose that any remarkable step in the discovery and promulgation of knowledge of

athe prevalent courses of the winds in those seas in and about the Torrid Zone is to be
eattributed to any one person in particular, nor that there was, indeed, any very
Bimportant and clear promulgation of the floating knowledge on the subject until the
Btime when the astronomer, Hairy, collected and systematized a large amount of
Bvaluable information, and presented it to the Royal Society, in his paper in the
‘Transactions’ of 1686, to which I shall make particular reference a little further on.
