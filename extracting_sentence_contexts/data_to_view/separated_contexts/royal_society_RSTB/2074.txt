LerrcEeB explains the different behaviour of the perianth and the leaf, by
the differences in the coercion exercised by the surrounding epidermis in the two
cases. More recently Kouxt has shown by the microscopic method that heat from
a blackened metal-plate, or a current of warm vapour rapidly open the stomata of
Trianea; he also used light which had passed through a solution of iodine in carbon
bisulphide. Exerr got similar results.§

This last fact I have confirmed. By means of a heliostat the sun’s rays were
passed through the bisulphide and kept the stomata of Campanula pyramidalis open
for two hours (March 30, temperature 17°). On March 29 the same species was
kept open for three hours at 15°, and the stomata shut on being darkened.
