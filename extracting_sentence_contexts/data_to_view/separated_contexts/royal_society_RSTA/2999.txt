232 DR. ©. CHREE: MAGNETIC DECLINATION

Table XTX. is principally intended to bring out two facts: (1) that the hour of
most frequent occurrence of the daily maximum is earlier in years of sunspot
minimum than in years of maximum ; (2) that the distribution of maxima is more
concentrated, 7.e. less uniform throughout the 24 hours, in years of sunspot minimum
than in years of maximum. The phenomenon first mentioned is most conspicuous in
winter.
