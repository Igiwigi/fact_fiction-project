Standard electric field and anomalous magnetic field: The first line of equation (2.2) still holds,
but since V x B =0, the field momentum is zero:

Pem =0. (2.4)

20f course, you could go back to equation (2.1) and insert B= V x A, but it’s a little easier to work from equation (2.2).

Isummarize these results as follows:

Now we will use these formulae to determine the field momenta of electric and magnetic
dipoles (both standard and anomalous) in external electric and magnetic fields (both standard


and anomalous). The dipoles are at rest (we might as well put them at the origin), and since they
occupy an infinitesimal volume we can expand the external potentials:

V(r) = V(0) + r- (VoV) = V(O) —r- E(0); A(t) = A(O) + (r- Vo)A; (2.10)

and

V(t) = V(0) +4r-(VoV) =V(0) —r- B(O); A(t) = A(0) + (r- Vo)A. (2.11)
