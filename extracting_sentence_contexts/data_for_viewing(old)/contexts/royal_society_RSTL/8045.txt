— idea of its rapidity before we can realize any thing like its full effect.

In order to make my remarks as definite as possible, I will again refer to the three
typical ships on waves of the dimensions previously assigned. The time of transit, of
waves 400 feet long is rather less than nine seconds (really 8:83 seconds), and in half that
time, or 44 seconds, we may suppose the © Minotaur* to have passed from the wave-crest

DX to the wave-hollow; while her maximum bending-strain has changed from 140,000 foot-
5 tons of hogging- to 74,000 foot-tons of sagging-moment; and every transverse section
5 has been subjected to similar changes in the character and amount of the strains brought
= upon it. The great rapidity in the variation of the strain is 80 apparent from this brief
statement of facts that T need not dwell upon it.
L The © Victoria and Albert” and the © Bellerophon' have been supposed to float on
= waves 300 feet long, for which the whole time of transit is less than 8 seconds (really
E 7:65 8econds). In half that time, therefore, or in less than 4 seconds, the ship may have
= passed from crest to hollow, and the bending-strains have passed through successive
© phases from one extreme to the other. On the crest the maximum hogging-moment,
= of the © Victoria and Albert* has been found to be about 16,400 foot-tons; in less than
-2 4 seconds, in the waye-hollow, the maximum sagging-moment may have reached 31,000
a foot-tons, at the same section of the ship which previously had to resist the hogging-
> 8train. This is, proportionately, the greatest change which we have met with. In the
S © Bellerophon' the change in the same brief interval, although not so great in proportion,
& is very striking ; for on the crest the hogging-moment amidships is 43,600 foot-tons,
= and in the wave-hollow the sagging-moment is 48,800 foot-tons.
