S Tt remains to consider the influence upon the air of its contact (in the vessel A) with
=the water employed to force it through the apparatus. This can be of three kinds :;â€”
1. The proportions of nitrogen and oxygen may be lightly affected by absorption,
under the influence of the slightly increased pressure to which the air is subjected.
= 2. 'The air may lose its carbonic acid.
FE: 3. It may become more or less saturated with aqueous vapour.
'Z The increase of pressure to which the air is subjected in the vessel A is s0 slight, and
She time in which it is there in contact with the water is 80 short, that the total amount
oxygen and nitrogen absorbed by the water must be very small; and, since any
'Zhange in the constitution of the total amount of air will be dependent on the ratio of
She absorption coefficients of oxygen and nitrogen on the one hand, and on the ratio of
e quantities of these gases in the air on the other, it will be yery much less than in
Ale actual amount of air absorbed; it will in fact be too small to be of any importance.
Ej The whole of the carbonic acid of the air may be absorbed by the water; but as
mangements are made for the artifical supply of it, this is of no consequence.
& The amount of water taken up by the air in the vessel A. would at first sight appear
ot be of more importance. But the time during which the air is in contact with the
Snater in the vessel A is very short, and probably too short for its saturation ; it must
Hose most or all of its acquired water in passing through the sulphuric acid in the bottles
and C, and over the pumice saturated with sulphuric acid in the tube DD, whilst the
xedried air passes too rapidly through the carbonate of soda solution in the bottle E for
Te-saturation ; and lastly, as the air in its previous course through the apparatus will be
cooler than within the shade, it will not be s0 near its point of saturation in the latter as
it may be before it reaches it.
