Other things being equal, however, the more abundant species in an area will tend to
occupy more of the available carrion than less abundant species, since it will discover more
of it. It will, to some extent, be subject to less intense interspecific competition but more
intense intraspecific competition than the less abundant species, since the latter will be
absent from some of the carcasses located by the former. This is sometimes indicated by the
results of carcass exposures. The question of the balance between the populations of the
different species and its influence upon the degree of competition which occurs on carrion is
more complex than appears at first sight. Further investigations on this aspect are required.

5. Specific adaptability
In the laboratory work it was found that certain inherent adaptations for withstanding
the adverse conditions of competition were present in fly populations. These will influence
the outcome of competition in the field. They are, in fact, among the most important of the
factors which do so. The extent of this influence will vary with the species concerned,

The adaptability of species to ranges of temperature within which functional activity
(i.e. oviposition and the like) can occur determines the minimum temperature at which
a given species can deposit eggs. No special study has been made on these lines for South
African blowflies, but it is known that this minimum temperature varies with different
species in other countries. In America, Deonier (1940) records the following minimum
ranges in which various flies become active about carrion: Cynomyia cadaverina R.-D.,
40 to 50째 F; Phormia regina Mg., 40 to 50째 F; Lucilia sericata Mg., 50 to 55째 F; and 50 to 60째 F
