SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS. P,, was distinctly to the kathodic side of the normal position of the centre of I,. If
allowance is made for the fact that the angles P,-wound, as measured, were probably
about 3°+5 too small (see section 5), then these angles show that, except in No. 32, the
divergences of the wounds from the true median position ranged from about 6° to 11° in
the kathodic direction. On the other hand wounds which were more nearly median,
usually led to the development of I,k only, as in Nos. 16, 22, 24 and 25 (see Table II). The explanation of these facts, which are at first surprising, is probably that the space
available for leaf-formation was usually smaller on the anodic side of the wound (see
section 11).
