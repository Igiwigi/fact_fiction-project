the outer is finely striated ; but whether the striations have any special significance
cannot say. From the cup proper this layer extends, as already mentioned, on to the
stem, which it completely invests, diminishing in thickness as it approaches the ape:
This cortical layer doubtless agrees with the alveolar layer of R. bates. As in R. batis,
it probably arises from altered muscle nuclei. In #. batis the alveolar layer at first
consists of a single layer of nucleated protoplasm, but it soon sends out projections,
which eventually give rise to a complex network. In R. circularis, on the other hand,
alveoli are never developed ; at the most a few short blunt processes (figs. 3 and 4, p,)
are thrown out from the outer surface of the cortex, more especially around the base
of the stem. It is, however, conceivable that in some other species the outer, or
cortical, layer of the cups may develop long complex processes similar to those of Rt.
batis. The gelatinous layer, as already indicated, is comparatively unimportant; it
surrounds the cups (c.t., fig, 5), and fills up the spaces between the stems; it, in fact,
forms a matrix in which the cups are embedded, and in which the blood vessels freely
ramify. One of the capillaries is represented in fig. 5 (c.p.). The capillaries form an
irregular network between and around the cups; but they never appear either to
enter the cups with the nerves or penetrate into the substance of the striated layer
through the cortex.

In a further communication I hope to give an account of the structure and
development of the electric cups of aia radiata and to indicate whether I consider
them retrograding or progressive structures.*
