Wludder. In Sehilbiehthys it will be noted that even the stem and inferior limb of thie
post-temporal may co-operate in securing this xesult.

We huve ventured to suggest this explanation in those cases where encapsulation is”
wost complete, because at frst sight it seems to be a legitimate inference from the
three facts ta which reference has just been made, but as iin objection it may ha
arged that the same physiological result might have heen gained hy simpler and more
batural means. Complete or partial atrophy of the air-bladder would even more
effectually have prevented transmission of useless stimuli to the auditory organ, and
would seem also to be the more natural as well aa the more easily aequired safeguard,
In some cises (e.y., Bagcarins, Glyplostermum, &e.) the latter method apparently is the
one adopted for the purpose, But if our previous conelusion, that the mseless air
bladder owes its singular persistence in these Siluroids to its connection with the
Weberian ossicles, be correct, it may nevertheless have happened that in other cages
reduction in the size of the air-bladder took place so slowly that encapsulation snper-
seded complete atrophy as a means for securing the object in question. Jt must also
he borne in mind that even iu its normal condition the air-bladder and its connective
tissue investment are frequently invaded by ossified deposit, ‘The superficial ossifica-
