occasions a precipitate in muriate of barytes, in which respect it differs from
the proper biphosphate. I failed in all my attempts to obtain the bipyrophos-
phate of soda in a crystalline form. It uniformly dried up into the state of a
friable white crust.

3. Third variety of the Biphosphate of Soda.

When the salt last described was exposed on the solder-bath for several days
at a temperature between 400* and 470), it lost weight ; only 3:48 parts out of
the entire 35'57 water were retained in one experiment, and 2-81 parts water in
another. The whole water was expelled, with the exception of 0:38 to 100 dry
salt, in other experiments in which the salt was heated on the sand-bath, proba-
bly at a temperature not much under 600?. The salt became in fact very nearly
anhydrous. Now on pouring water upon the salt s0 dried, the greater part of
it-dissolved at once, but an inconstant quantity remained undissolved, varying
from 6:57 to 18 parts in 100 salt, but increasing with the intensity of the heat
to which the salt had been exposed. This insoluble matter is a fourth variety
of the biphosphate, which shall immediately be noticed. As this insoluble salt
may be proved to be of the same composition as the biphosphate, it follows
that the soluble portion is unaltered in composition.

The insoluble- portion appears a heavy dense powder; yet as-a part of it
