This follows as in (5).

(d) At most four regions meet at a node. By interchanging (y,,0,) with (no, 05), if necessary, we can
have only A lee fa eek). Apt i ee

Except for the fact that ¢, = ¢,, this follows at once from (a), (6) and (c). That ¢,= ¢,
follows at once from (7-7). By putting (¢,y, ¢,0) for (y,d) this gives us case ¢ of the theorem.
