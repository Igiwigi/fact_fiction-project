It is conceivable that the long-continued
Becquerel radiation from fatigued phosphorescent substances arises in like manner from very sudden
release cf their molecules into new groupings, in the course of their gradual return to a natural or
unfatigued configuration. * The periods of small free vibrations, and the amplitudes of small forced ones, would not be affected
by reversal of all the gyrostatic momenta in the system: in fact this reversal would just change the

system into its optical image. 212

sum of squares, which would be all necessarily positive if there were no gyrostatic
influence. It may then be shown in the manner of the preceding analysis that
A/P, is equal to a fraction of which the denominator is the period determinant of the
molecule and the numerator is the minor of its leading term ; the numerator is there-
fore the period determinant of the same molecule when its leading coordinate is
prevented by constraint from varying.
