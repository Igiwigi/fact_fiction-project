During
the same period there was also weakness, not amounting to paralysis, of the orbicu-
laris palpebrarum on the side of lesion. These phenomena may be ascribed to division of the posterior longitudinal bundle,
which was revealed at the post-mortem examination. The conjugate deviation
indicates that the centrifugal path from the cerebral cortex to the opposite sixth
nerve nucleus decussates in the neighbourhood of the quadrigeminal bodies, and passes
downwards in the tegmentum pontis; and it also points to the fact that the fibres
from the sixth to the opposite third nucleus decussate at once on leaving the abducens
nucleus and pass up by the opposite tegment, probably in the posterior longitudinal
bundle ; for if this were not so, there would have been deviation to the left of the
eye on the side of lesion without a coexistent conjugate deviation of the right eye. The weakness of the orbicularis palpebrarum on the side of lesion lends support to
the view that some of its fibres of innervation arise in the third nerve nucleus and
pass downwards in the posterior longitudinal body, which was divided in our
experiment. Subsequent microscopic examination of the pons Varolii in both these cases
showed that the tegmentum was divided on the left side, as well as the mesial fillet
wholly or partially.
