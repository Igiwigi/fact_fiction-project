What strange nebular forms it may reveal, what new configurations of stars, what new
comical laws it may unfold, what new elements it may disclose, we s0on shall know ;
and the fulfilment of these high anticipations will I am sure be the best compensation
to the maker of this noble telescope for all the thought and toil which were required
to make it what it is; and also, may I be permitted to say, to the three whom the
Society associated with him in this great work, and who, though in a far inferior mea-
sure, shared with him the intellectual labour and the anxieties connected with the
task. Even the practical experience which has been gained in its construction is a
precious addition to our knowledge: and in this belief we have thought it right to
put on record its leading facts. They who, as I hope, will hereafter try to equal or
surpass the Great Melbourne Telescope will not think these details tedious. Eyen they
who have no special interest in optical or mechanical science may be reminded that eyery
well-established fact, everything which extends man's control over the inert masses or
the energetic forces which surround him, is an element of power, is an agent whose po-
tency may extend far beyond his ken, is an everlasting possession of the human race.

Rate of Cooling of the Specula.

[Fig. 42. A represents the temperature-curvye of the first speculum, B of the second, and
C the mean of the two. The abscisxe are the number of days from the casting to the
removal of the specula from the oven; the ordinates are the degrees of the galyano-
meter. The temperature of A when removed was 70?, about 5* above the air, that of B
was 72%, about 20Â® above the air. The oven, when they were introduced, was believed
