In both examples it is by the addition of new internal
layers around the central cavity. The same is the case in the tubercles and teeth of
Macropoma. These facts (if correctly interpreted, and T believe them to be 80) con-
firm the necessity of my proposed restriction of the terms ganoin, enamel (email), &c. Two perfectly distinct structures have hitherto been comprehended in the expression
* enamel,‚Äù as hitherto applied to the scales of fish, viz. the snperficial, transparent,
hyaline tissue, which usually gives glossiness to the surface of the scale, and a sub-
jacent one, which I propose to distinguish by the name of kosmine*. In some genera,
such as Megalichthys, this latter structure is gradually blended with the former, the
line of demarcation not being visible ; whilst in others, 8nch as Lepidotus, Palceoniscus
ete., it is perfectly distinct from it, blending rather with the snbjacent osseons
tissue. 'These two appear to be as distinct as bone and dentine.
