worked much deeper, and the facility of access to these mines would materially
diminish the labour of the experiment; while the intimate. acquaintance with the
geological character of the country possessed by the coal-owners, and the general
regularity of the beds, would give great confidence in the ultimate calculations of the
attraction of the mass of matter principally affecting the experiment. After a lapse
of twenty-six years from the last attempt in Cornwall, I therefore seriously took up
the subject again, and proceeded personally to examine the fitness of the coal-mines
of Durham for the experiment.

10. Assisted by the introductions of Davip LizTcn, Esq., M.D., and by the local
knowledge of Jamzs Maruzr, Esq., I had little difficulty in fixing on a mine. The
deepest mines in the Durham coal-field are near the coast. The deepest of all is the
Monk Wearmonth Colliery ; but it is 80 close to the sea (its workings in fact extending
far under the ea), that it seemed probable that more of disadvantage would be intro-
duced by the complication of the elements of final computations than of advantage
by its extreme depth. The next in depth, I believe, is the Harton Pit, at the distance
of s0mewhat more than two miles from South Shields, and about the same distance
from the coast. The general circumstances of form of surface, &c. are as favourable
as can usnally be found. Its depth is reputed to be 1260 feet. On making known
to WiLLiam ANDERSON, Esq., the principal owner of the coal-mine, my wieh to try
the experiment in that place, I was at once assured that every assistance should be
given to me. In company with C. W. AnpersoN, Exq. and with G. W. ArKkLey, Esq.
(local viewer and snperintendent of the mine-works) in 1854, August 5, I examined
the buildings on the surface and the workings underground in the © Bensham seam,”
and stations for the pendulums were speedily chosen. The two stations were exactly
