As it is nob always
possible to find good reference lines within that distance, I have generally used three
reference lines, and taken the inverse fourth powers of the wave-lengths into account. I am not quite certain that even then the errors of interpolation did not exceed, in 8ome
cages, slightly the errors of observation. The reason why the ordinary interpolation

. formula, cannot be used, does not lie 8&0 much in the fact that the law of the inverse
square does not hold accurately for refractive indices (although this, of course, is also
true), but that, except in automatic spectroscopes, our measurements are not propor-
tional to refractive indices. It is difficult to say to what degree of accuracy measurements are made, yet I trust
that, excepb for the weakest lines, the error of my meagurements will be seldom found
to exceed 0'5 x" metre. After these remarks I pass to the description of the various spectra of oxygen.
