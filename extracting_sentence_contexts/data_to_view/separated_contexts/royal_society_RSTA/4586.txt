The
outputs of different numerical methodologies may differ slightly, for the same initial conditions,
but these differences dwarf the uncertainties in source characterization, or differences in results
when convergence is not checked, or when inexperienced people use them. The latter requires
context and experience. While likely hundreds of thousands have played with games such as
‘flight simulator’, rigorous training is required to allow the same to fly real airplanes, and in fact
only a fraction do. Ending, we are reminded of the tribal communities of the Indian Ocean and islands, such as
in the Andamans or the Solomons, with no access to modern warning systems. The former fared
