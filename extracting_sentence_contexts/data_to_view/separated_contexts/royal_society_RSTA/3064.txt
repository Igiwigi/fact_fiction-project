26 MR. 8S. W. J. SMITH ON THE THERMOMAGNETIC ANALYSIS OF

is even more regular than appears from the photographs. At the same time, the
want of symmetry in the numbers given, showing an apparent anomaly in the
positions of the layers parallel to 11, is, I think, too great to be accounted for as
arising from unavoidable errors of observation. The chief importance, for the present purpose, of the numbers and description just
given lies in the fact that they serve to define the geometrical distribution of the
alloys of different composition in the ring of which the permeability was examined. It was proved directly by polishing and etching the ring at the conclusion of the
experiments that the regularity of distribution observed in the core extended to the
portion of the material of which the ring was composed.

§ 6. The micro-structure of the meteorite is shown in the four photographs (Plate 2),
for three of which I am indebted to Mr. Wratcut.
