We are therefore justified in putting IL(~ ; a, b,c) equal to the expression with
an added term which contains the factor (ce). Write, therefore,

IL(; a,b,c) = {reget} fa+2 pie et {te ae OF to ) F (»; a,b, ¢). GF (; a,b,c) =

in the form

By working out several particular cases I was led to the conjecture
F(o; a, b,c) = os

(2)

and I then found that the expression

{irene} {14 glee} {ite enh + Gta v** (a—b)—a*** (b—c)}

does, as a fact, satisfy the functional equation. Art. 9. Having thus, beyond doubt, established the forms of IL( ; a, b) and
IL(; a, b, c), I proceed to a study of the functional equations.
