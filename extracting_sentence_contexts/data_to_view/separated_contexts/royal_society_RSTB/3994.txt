As the
stalk becomes smaller its attachment to the disc shifts outwards still further in
the direction named (Plate 21, fig. 15). However, in the end the ring canal of the
hydroccele is completed in such a way that the remains of the cavity passing
outwards from the axial sinus into the root of the stalk are encircled by the
hydroccele (Plate 24, fig. 30). This important fact in asterid ontogeny was first
demonstrated by MacBrie in the case of Asterina gibbosa (55, p. 356), and after-
wards noted by myself in Solaster (29, p. 27). But whereas in A. rubens (p. 254)
a portion of the left ccelom intervenes between the stalk cavity and the region which
will become adult axial sinus, in the other two starfish named there is from the first
a common anterior coelomic chamber, so that the question of a left coelomic element

intervening between stalk cavity and axial sinus proper was naturally not raised at
all. The point has a bearing on the relation of the crinoid to the asterid stalk (p. 255).
