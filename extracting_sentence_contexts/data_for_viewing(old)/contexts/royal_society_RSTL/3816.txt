poration of water or alcohol which takes place under their influence, is traced (in
addition to the facts brought forward in the notes on my first paper on this subject)


6 SIR J. F. W. HERSCHEL ON PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESSES.

in the experiments described in Arts. 205, 208, in the latter of which a chemical
action, distinet from the calorific, seems also traceable. I may here also mention
that the rays which operate the change of colour in muriate of cobalt from rose colour
to green appear to be the calorific rays generally, and the effect to be one of sinple
evaporation ; Since under the action of the spectrum I find the green colour not re-
stricted to the © parathermic” region, but to extend far beyond the red, and to be, in
fact, commensurate with the calorific spectrum, 80 far as it conld be traced in an ex-
periment made under unfavourable circumstances.

I have the honour to remain, my dear Sir,

Yours yery truly,

J, F. W. Herscnrr.
