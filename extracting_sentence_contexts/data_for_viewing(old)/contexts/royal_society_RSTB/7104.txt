vesicle, as in figure 3. When the latter occurs, it has a definite shape, but equally definitely
it may be absent. There is a similar structure between the lower tips of the scuta where they
are connected to the base of the rostrum, and these plates also carry small boss√©s in this
region (figures 3 and 4).*

The constitution of the tergal bosses is as puzzling as their function. They are always
irregular in outline, a fact noticed by Darwin (1851, p. 368), who describes them as
roughened. The difficult point to explain arises from the method of growth of the capitular
plates of Lithotrya. These grow by adding on new zones at their bases, and polarized light
shows very clearly the manner by which new calcareous matter has been laid down
(figure 26). It will be seen that a zone of deposition passes right through a tergal boss.
It can only be concluded from this that the boss is resorbed at each moult and then reformed
lower down the plate. This fact would make it impossible for the bosses to act as a hinge
during opening and closing of the valves. It would, however, account for the irregular
outline of the boss.

4. THE VELUM

The soft vascular lining of the mantle cavity extends upwards from the peduncle to end
in the capitular region on a level with the lower margins of the capitular plates. Rostral
to the carina, however, the lining projects forwards between the two terga as a shelf which
thus forms a velum partly closing the mantle entrance (figures 1 and 3).

On either side of the carina the thickened chitin layer of the girdle, which I have already
described, extends inwards at the base of the crevice between the carina and the terga. The
