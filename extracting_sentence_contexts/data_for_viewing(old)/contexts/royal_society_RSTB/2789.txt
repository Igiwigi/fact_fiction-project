is due to this cause (paralysis of the phrenic nerve-ends), and how far to failure of
the respiratory centre. To clear up this point he made two experiments, one on a
cat and the other ona rabbit. The phrenic (left) was exposed in the neck, and
stimulated at intervals, the results being graphically recorded. He was led to
conclude that “the first and most important action of the poison appears to be its
effect on the respiratory centre, although the paralysis of the phrenics speedily
ensues, and is a very important feature of the action of the venom.”

Rogers used a current with the secondary coil at 25 millims. Racorzi* has
stated that in order to obtain evidence of peripheral nerve-end paralysis in cobraism,
one must avoid the administration both of large rapidly fatal doses and of too small
doses. In fact, there must be a moderately large dose in circulation, and it must be
allowed a sufficient time to act. One of us has recently shown that the phrenic
nerve-ends remain fully sensitive (@) in animals which have been poisoned by large
intravenous doses of Cobra venom, and (b) in those which have been killed by
subcutaneous doses not greatly exceeding the minimum lethal. It was at the same
time shown that the phrenic nerve-ends can be paralysed by giving lethal doses and
then maintaining life by means of artificial respiration. The obvious inference was
that in cobraism the respiratory centre is first attacked; and that this was not
improbable was demonstrated by exposing the medulla oblongata and applying Cobra
venom directly to its surface, when the centre speedily became paralysed, in one
ease death occurring in 12 mins.
