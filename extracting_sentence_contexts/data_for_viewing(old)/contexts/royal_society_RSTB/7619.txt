The following facts indicate that one stock of the ancestors of the islanders were
allied to some of the ancestors of the people who now inhabit the valley of the Torassi
(Bensbach) river.

The jagged line technique extends on the mainland from the neighbourhood of the
Torassi to the estuary of the Bamu. Scattered representations of animals are shown on
a pipe (figure 26) from east of the Torassi and presumably from the Kanum, and on a
pipe (figure 41) from the south-west of the Semariji country near the east bank of the
Torassi.

The rectangular patterns and their technique of the Truro pipe from Mer (figure 60)
are in what Williams terms ‘the true Keraki technique’ and are analogous to those of a
pipe (figure 29) from the Garembo of the lower Torassi, but in the Mer pipe the
