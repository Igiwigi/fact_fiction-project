where observe that the single letters C, B, F, A, D, E correspond to the odd functions
5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14 respectively.

75. The ground of the notation is as follows :—

The algebraical relations between the double theta-functions are such that intro-
ducing six constant quantities a, b, ec, d, e, f and two variable quantities (&, y) it is
allowable to express the 16 functions as proportional to given functions of these quan-
tities (a, b, c, d, e, f; z, y); viz.: there are six functions the notations of which depend
on the single letters a, b, c, d, e, f respectively, and 10 functions the notations of
which depend on the pairs ab, ac, ad, ae, be, bd, be, cd, ce, de respectively: each of the
16 functions is in fact proportional to the product of two factors, viz.: a constant factor
depending only on («, Þ, e, d, e, /'), and a variable factor containing also @ and ys
Attending in the first instance to the variable factors, and writing for shortness
