H 4 i | [sim (2? — m?) = a,NI?.

And since we have been dealing with saturation cases, | = 9, and we write the above
result in the form

H sin (¢ — ¥)/S3 sin ¥ cos | cos 2y = a,N .9?,

which is the same result as obtained before (1.3).


THE THEORY OF FERROMAGNETIC CRYSTALS. 79

Remarks.—I. It should be noted that the fact that a,, = 0 for all r at once rules
out an even-power law for the molecular field. We further see that a relation

(He — Natt
(H.), = Nagl?m

yields the same result as was arrived at by the atomistic theory. ‘The same conclusion

could be seen from another view-point.

II. We have seen before that on the conception of mutual actions of the magnetic
elements the effective total energy in its modified form was
