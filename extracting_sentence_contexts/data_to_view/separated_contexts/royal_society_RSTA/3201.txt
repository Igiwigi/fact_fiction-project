Before we can claim that the non-minimal coupling for the Higgs field can give rise to
vacuum decay during reheating, we must analyse how the backreaction from the created particles
modifies the tachyonic resonance. Indeed, it is a generic feature of preheating that once the
particle density resulting from the resonance becomes significant its backreaction will lead to
the switching off of the resonance [18]. However, the main backreaction for the Higgs field results
from the generation of an effective mass due to the self-interaction term ~ 2G), which in fact
amplifies the effect since 4 <0 due to curvature-induced running if the scale of reheating is
large enough, as we explained in the previous section. As an estimate of the significance of the
backreaction from the generation of an effective mass from interactions we obtain by using

A(H) ~ Ap sign(A; â€” H), with Ag ~ 0.01, (5.6)

with the choice 4 = H. Another backreaction mechanism is given by the potential gravitational
significance of the generated particle density.
