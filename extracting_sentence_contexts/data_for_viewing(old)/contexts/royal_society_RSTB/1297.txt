end of the spectrum is absorbed as far as G, at the other end the absorption extends
far as 55, which is somewhat less than the amount given by Mosrtey. In the
“qreen solution produced by treatment with caustic soda the absorption of the violet
‘end blue extends as far as 47, that of the red to 66. I have not been able, for want
#f time, to extend my observations on the colouring matter of Heliopora ; the violet
@eaction with nitric acid suggests some affinity with murexin, from which however it
Gitfers in other characters.
© As regards the mode of growth and architecture of the colony, I am unable to agree
ith the account given by Mosetry and illustrated by his figure, Plate 9, fig. 15. He
_fsumes the existence of a mother polyp which grows vertically upwards, giving off
Bteral buds or stolons, which subdivide repeatedly and give rise to coenenchymal
*Beca, amongst which calicles are here and there formed by the suppression of a limited
mber of tubes. The explanation is ingenious, but it is controverted by the fact
‘Phat there is not, in any colony, any trace of such a central apical polyp, and a study
e the colony, especially of its central layer and of its growing edge, shows most
Ponvincingly that the ccenenchymal cxca are the active agents of growth and
pansion, and that the polyps are only secondarily formed amongst and out of these.
is is shown to be the case by a study of fig. 4; the growth at the edge of the
Zolony is effected by the endodermic outgrowths (MoseLry’s superficial layer of canals)
Which penetrate into the newly formed mesoglea beneath the ectoderm, and thence
“grow outwards as new coenenchyme ceca, (Compare p. 459.) An examination of the
oes at the growing edge, such as is represented in fig. 5, shows that new tubes
riginate as small triangular cavities, usually in the spaces where the walls common
Ao three contiguous chambers unite together, and that they end blindly below. They
are, in fact, intercalations between, and are not (with few exceptions), branches of
