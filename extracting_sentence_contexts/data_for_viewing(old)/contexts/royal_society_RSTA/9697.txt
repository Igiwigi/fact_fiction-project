Another law also appears in the relation of the Sharp series to the Principal, viz.,
that the denominators for the Sharp series of any element are found by deducting a
constant value from the corresponding denominator of the Principal series, except
that the difference is a greater one for the first term, they are roughly as follows :—

Zn. . 5283, 5249; Cd. . °5263,°5224; Al. . ‘4898,°4844; Tl. . 5949, °5891;
Na.. ‘4901; K.. °4660; Rb.. °4856; Cs. . 4880;

a similar arrangement also is shown by the suggested allocation in Hg, viz., 6036,
‘59, an additional evidence in its favour. The differences between P and § in the list
do not appear to be rigorously constant after m= 2. This can be easily explained
by very small changes in the limits P(#) or S(o). In fact, as has been seen
already, Ryppera's law does not appear to be quite rigorously exact. PASCHEN’S

2°907231 would make the first number ‘6659, and, therefore, quite out of analogy
with the others. Again, in the alkalies the same law is seen, with just the same
modification as in the previous case, viz., constant for each.

A closer inspection shows that the differences between the P terms cannot be
exactly constant after m= 2. They seem to descend in two steps instead of one.
The general law, however, seems so well established that the cause of the real
