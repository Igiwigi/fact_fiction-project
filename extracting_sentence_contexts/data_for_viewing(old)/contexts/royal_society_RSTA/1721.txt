Here, the function f+> z(t) is considered as a control function. As Iy is an admissible feedback,
then t+> v(t,-) is the state of the closed loop-system associated with (Q, B,C). This means that
equation (4.12) is equivalent to

i(t,)=Q"v(t,), v0,)=9, #20,
where

Q1=Q14+BCa, DQ") = (ye D(Ca):(Q-1 + BCa) y € Ep},

which generates a strongly continuous semigroup on Ep. By using a similar proof as in [27,
Thm. 4.1], lemma 4.4, and the fact that e, are eigenvalues of Qm, one can see that the operator


Q" coincides with
Qke =Qme, D(Qk) = {¢ € D(Qm) : 9(0) = Kg}.

The semigroup generated by Qx is given by: for any t > 0, g € Ey and t <0,

In the rest of this section, we deal with neutral equations with non-autonomous past. To this
