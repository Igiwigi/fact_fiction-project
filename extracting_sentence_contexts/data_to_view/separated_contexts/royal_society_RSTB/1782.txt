But as for their general
direction they show always the same tendency (that is, from north-east to south-west). According to the advancement from younger fathers to older ones, they keep always
towards the younger mothers, and form, in this direction, nearly parallel contours. Passing in the following part of this chapter to the specified isogens constructed
on the adjusted figures of the single age combinations, we must give a general
caution, that all the following deductions hold good only so far as the bulk of
observations which fall upon each single age combination are sufficiently numerous,
and so far as we may thence conclude that the striking regularities which present
themselves after the operation of adjustment represent the real effect of facts, and
not the artificial effect of intentional smoothing. The isogens have been constructed by me on the following method :â€”
If the probability for the single age combinations of the parents could all be expressed in whole
= numbers, we should have nothing more to do than to connect all the squares marked by identical figures. If further, we had to do exclusively with vertical or exclusively with horizontal curves, we should need
simply to draw connected lines from the centre of one square to the centre of the other square showing
the same probability.
