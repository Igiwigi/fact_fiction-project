F.R.S. Read February 7, 1811. M:zxrnar. bodies being, in fact, natzrve chemical preparations,
perfectly analogous to those of the laboratory of art, it is only
by chemical means, that their species can be ascertained with
any degree of certainty, especially under all the variations of
mechanical state and intimate admixture with each other, to
which they are subject. And accordingly, we sce those methods which profess to
supersede the necessity of chemistry in mineralogy, and to

powers, by turning to her for a solution of the difficulties
which continually arise to them, and to. obtain firm grounds
