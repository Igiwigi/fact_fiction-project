£ The symbols of the faces of the primary form are (p, o, 0).
2 7.There is in fact, however, no necessity to suppose the
23 secondary forms to be produced either by truncation of a
3 primary one, or by addition to it. If we suppose that the
3 «mall rhomboids, of which A a was assumed to be made up,
E are continued through all the space round the point A, we
n may conceive a plane to pzss among these, parallel to PQR. E And this plane will be represented by (p;q:;r) indepen-
E dently of any consideration of the rhomboid A a or the point
a A; for if we take any pornt, and from it draw lines to the

plane, parallel to the three edges A z, Ay, Az, these three

lines will be as por =.
