«This rate continued quite regularly for a quarter of an hour, when the observation
terminated.”

It might naturally be supposed that when the alterations of temperature between 34*
and 49* produce such marked effects on the rhythm, still greater alterations would be *
attended with still greater effects. Such, however, is not the cage. Water at 70? or
80, for instance, has the effect of permanently diminishing the rate of the rhythm, after
having temporarily raised it for a few seconds. The following note will serve to convey
a just estimation of these facts :!—

« An Aurelia, whose rhythm in water at 40* was very regular at 18 per minute, was
snddenly transferred to water at 80%. In the immediately succeeding minutes the
rhythm was 22, 20, 14. The latter rate continued for nearly half an hour, when the
observation terminated.”

The effect of very warm water, therefore, is to slow the rhythm, as well, I may add,
as to enfeeble the vigour of the contractions. The case of Meduse thus differs, in the
former respect, from that of the heart; and I think the reason of the difference is to be
found in the following considerations. Even slight elevations of temperature are
quickly fatal to the Medusz, s0 it becomes presumable that considerable elevations act
very destructively on the nervo-muscular tissues of these animals. "This destructive
