The Instructions of the Royal Society, which were written before the periodical
character of the s0-called © irregular” variations was suspected, conternplate that by
a sufficiently long continuance of the obseryations the effects of the © irregular va-
riations” will be self-compensatory. © The observations,” it is said, © must be long-
continued at the same hours, before we can be assured that the irregularities do not
sensibly affect the mean results.” But since the true character of the disturbances is
now more correctly known, it becomes obvious that no continuance of the observa-
tions will render their influence insensible : and the simplification of the problem, in
the solution of which Mr. Farapar is engaged, will require the separation, as far as
may be practicable, especially in the higher latitudes, of the two classes of variation
which have distinet laws, and therefore probably distinct immediate causes. I yen-
ture therefore to hope for the indulgence of the Royal Society in an endeavour to
establish the fact of a distinet law of periodical action in the disturbances of occa-
8lonal occurrence and unusual amount,—to show its general and remarkably analo-
gous character at two stations separated from each other nearly as widely as two
Stations can be on the surface of the globe, and approximately at least to separate
the mean diurnal variations at those two stations into their respective components.

The stations of Toronto and Hobarton are well-situated to furnish observations to
be employed in the investigation which forms the subject of this paper. Both stations
