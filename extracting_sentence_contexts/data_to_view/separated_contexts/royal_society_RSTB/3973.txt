His average figures for the oxygen
capacity regenerated per day expressed as a percentage of the normal total oxygen
capacity before the hemorrhage are 1°6 for large rabbits, 2°3 for small rabbits, 4°6 for
large rats, and 6'1 for small rats. Our results on Pike’s Peak on man seem at first
sight to be at variance with these, for we generated hemoglobin at a rate of the same
order of magnitude as the rabbits. Further consideration of the facts in the two
cases convinces us, however, that it would be unfair with the knowledge at our disposal
at present to draw such a conclusion from a comparison of the two series of experi-
ments. The conditions in the two series were entirely different, for in Boycort’s
experiments the animals were making good a loss, in our experiments the subjects
were making excess, and we are not sure that we are justified in referring Boycort’s
values to the total oxygen capacity immediately after the hemorrhage instead of to
the normal before the hemorrhage, in order to better the comparison. The stimuli
provoking the regeneration were, moreover, different in the two cases, though Boycorr
notes that he has found that the rate of formation of red cells in rats may be as quick
under the stimulus of reduced atmospheric pressure as after hemorrhage.
