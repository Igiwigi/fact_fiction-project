XXIX. An Account of certain Receptacles
of Air, in Birds, which communicate
with the Lungs, and are hdged both

A among the fleſhy Parts and in the hollow
N Bones of thoſe Animals, By John Hun-
E , ter, ®. R.S.

& Redde, Feb. 27, HE fingular communications
E 1774+ which are found to ſubſiſt, in
S birds, between the cavities of the lungs, and
S certain other cavities in the fleſhy parts and
2 in the bones, being peculiar to that tribe of
2 animals, and having never yet been ſufficiently
S explained, nor perhaps attended to, either by ana-
S  tomilts or natural hiſtorians ; I imagine, that an ac-
& count of them will not be unacceptable to this ſociety.
= It is not my preſent defign, to enter into minute
5 deſcriptions of all the particular communications of
= this ſort, to be found in the difieftion of theſe ani-
S mals; butonly to mention ſuch general facts, as will be
S Aufficient to introduce the ſubject into natural hiſtory,
S and ſerve to open the enquiry into the final cauſe. A To make this matter more intelligible, 1 muſt
previouſly give an idea of the difference, between
the particular cells in queſtion, and thoſe other cells
of the cellular” membrane, common to all animals ;

and alſo ſhew wherein thoſe bones which receive
air, differ from ſuch as do not. 7

The air-cells, which are found in the ſoft parts of
birds, have no communication with the cavity of
the common cellular membrane of the body : ſome
of them communicate immediately with one ano-
ther; and all of them may be faid to have a com-
munication together, by 'means of the lungs, as
a common centre. Some of theſe are bags placed
in larger cavities, ſuch as the abdomen ; others are ſo
lodged in the interſtices of parts, that they woul8d, at
firſt, appear to be the common connecting mem-
brane, as about the breaſt, ax://a, &c.
