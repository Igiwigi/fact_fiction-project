where R is a deterministic analogue of the Reynolds stress tensor (2.1). The ‘convexity restriction’
alluded to in the previous section leads to the information that, for any x,t the tensor R(x, t) is
necessarily symmetric, positive semi-definite and |i| + tr R < M.

In [21,22], it is shown that this is in fact the only constraint satisfied by the weak limit. The
main result can be formulated as follows:

Theorem 3.1. Let (iu, R) be a bounded weak solution of (3.3) such that R is symmetric and pointwise
either positive definite or zero. Then there exists a sequence of weak solutions ux of (3.1) such that |u|? =
ja? + tr R for almost every (x,t), and uz — i weakly in L?2 ask oo.

In the special case when R is a multiple of the identity matrix, R= xId, with x compactly
supported in space-time, this theorem recovers the pioneering result of Scheffer [23] and the
subsequent works of Shnirelman [24,25], that is, the existence of nontrivial weak solutions of the
incompressible Euler equations that have compact support in space and time.

Surprisingly, this counterintuitive ‘softness’ of weak solutions of the incompressible Euler
