As Cuvier demonstrated, there is no © mantle” in Pneumodermon and ClioF ; the
body of these mollusks answering precisely to that of a Firoloides. The relation of
the gill-laminze and of the small anomalous shell in Pneumodermon sufficiently cor-
roborates Cuvigr's view. Gills are never placed upon the outer surface of a mantle ;
and if anything answers to such an organ it must be the small space covered by the
rudimentary sbell, so that the relations of the parts are, in fact, similar in Pneumoder-
mon to what we find in Firola and Carinaroides. Finally, new parts, the * ale,” make their appearance in these genera and give its
character to the order (figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, ep).
