The
particles of oxygen and silver have therefore acquired by this association with the
chlorine and potassium a chemical relation or affinity which at other times they
have not. This is the fact. The rational conception of the fact is given in the ex-
pression

in which I have indicated the polar relation of the snbstances. The chemical re-
lation therefore between the oxygen and sllver is essentially dependent on the che-
mical relation between the oxygen and potassium, in the same way as a negative
and positive electricity are related to each other. The same is true of the relation
between any other two particles of the system.
