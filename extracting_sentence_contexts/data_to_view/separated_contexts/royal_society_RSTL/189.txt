PrEcnTrL is, that the degree of

V compressibility may be such that each particle will be sur-
Q rounded by six others, giving it the form of a cube, which, it
5 must be admitted, is a very possible supposition. ST All further application of the same hypothesis is precluded
S by M. PxecnTL, by denying that one particle can be surrounded
= by more than six others; although in fact it is most evident,
2 that any sphere when not compressed will be surrounded by
'A twice that number, and consequently by a slight degree of
= compression will be converted into a dodecahedron, according
5 to the most probable hypothesis of simple compression.
