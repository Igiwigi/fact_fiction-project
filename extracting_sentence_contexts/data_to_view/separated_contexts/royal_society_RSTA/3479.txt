Now the optimization becomes relatively simple
and can be written as
V*(t= th) = max[Vi(tk; tepid] (4.6)

The optimal condition (4.6) can then be transformed into the terminal condition required to solve
for the previous period [t,_1, f;]. The appropriate condition at t, is then

Vi(t = th ith) = maxlVj( ty; tev], (4.7) :&

for all i. The positive and negative superscripts take account of the fact that our choice of S
commitment is in the period [t,_1, ty] or [tk, tri]. : 2
Now if the market includes a delay, so that the owner must precommit to a delivery rate 1S
starting in the future, then at time ft, the owner must choose from the set {C;} for the period : ~
starting at f;41 and ending at t,;. We approximate the full set of admissible controls by a finite : 4
set of pairs, where each pair includes the commitment for the current period as well as the next. :B
So we denote C; ; = (Cj, Cj) as the scenario in which C; is the current commitment and C; is the :3
commitment at the next step, and V;; to denote the value of implementing that control strategy. : =

We have

for th <t < ty 41. Here V7 (tet7 tk+2) indicates the value of committing C; at ty,1 followed by the
optimal commitments for t > th.
