any way by the individual characteristics of the parent or any other particular
ancestor. The results are therefore in complete accord with the views of inheritance
in mixed populations upheld by JoHannsEn.

There is another method by which we can determine whether there was any
inheritance of intraclonal variation. The material for this is provided by the fact
that two lines were bred from each clone, so that in each generation a pair of
members of each clone was selected for parentage. We can see therefore whether
the large members of these pairs had larger offspring than the small members
or not.

The number of individuals available for this investigation is less than for the
previous one, owing to the fact that of course all those pairs of which the two
members were of equal size, or of which one died, had to be rejected. The number
left, however, is quite large enough for our purposes. Altogether 135 such pairs
could be utilised for birth measurements and 100 for adult measurements. The
results are given in Table V.

In reading this table, the following points must be kept in mind :â€”

(1) The measurements here used are the actual not the corrected ones, Correction
was unnecessary owing to the fact that the two lines of a single clone naturally kept
nearly synchronous in their development from generation to generation, so that an
allowance for conditions changing between corresponding points in their life-history
was not so urgent ;
