S my remarks to the hearts of a lower class of animals. In the
2 Mollusca there is no reason for putting guards upon the action
i= of the heart, as in fishes, because in them the blood first sup-
Z plies the different parts of the body, and only in its return
i= passes through the gills; but there is a regulation of another
S kind, by means of which the circulation is increased or dimi-
S_ nished, according to the activity or torpor of the animal. In
E. the teredines, where a boring engine, requiring a great mus-
E cular power to work it, is almost constantly employed, the
= heart consists of two auricles and two ventricles ; the auricles
[- strong, cylindrical, and having valves between them and the
& ventricles; the ventricles themselves very strong, 80 that in
65 fact there is a heart, composed of two auricles and two ven=
= tricles, both acting at the same time, and the blood is hurried
5 on by a double power to supply the muscles of the boring
= shells, and, in this part of its course, has a bright red colour.

In the Oyster, on the other hand, the heart consists of only |
one auricle and one ventricle, both very weak in their muscular |

power, when compared with those of the teredines, although
belonging to an animal of larger dimensions ; but the heart is
Iis
