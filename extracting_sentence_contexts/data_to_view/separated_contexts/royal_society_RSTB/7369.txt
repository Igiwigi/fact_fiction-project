It will make no difference to the argument
whether a positive pressure exists within the lung lumen to distend the lung (as in Amphibia)
or whether the lumen is enlarged by pressures lower than atmospheric outside the lung
(as in Mammalia). Both mechanisms will evoke elastic recoil, assisted in Amphibia by
contraction of plain muscle in the edges of the septa. Available evidence shows that the
facts of lung growth in the rabbit can be fitted more easily into this scheme than into
