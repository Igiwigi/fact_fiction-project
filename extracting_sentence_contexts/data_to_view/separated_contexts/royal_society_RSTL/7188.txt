1, o, 0). We may distinguish its ventral and its dorsal faces (c, D), the former looking towards

concavity of the calyx, whilst the latter is in contact with the centro-dorsal plate ;
internal face (B) bordering the central space of the pentagonal disk ; its two lateral
sRrfaces (B, 7, #) by which it adheres to its fellows; and its external face (a), by
which it is articulated with the Second Radial. The ventral face (0) is divided by two
drved ridges (d, d), bending towards each other along the median line, and there sepa-
rted by a furrow, into a central and a peripheral portion, the former sloping inwards,
& as to contribute to the formation of the central funnel ; whilst the latter slopes
<twards, 80 as in fact to become part of the external face of the plate. ' The dorsal

e (D) is slightly convex, but is free from irregularity, except that there is a deep
=o (4) in the centre of its inner margin.
