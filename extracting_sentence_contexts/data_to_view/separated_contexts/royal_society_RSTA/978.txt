For many years the only
such points known were the A,, Ap, and A, points, and it was not until better facilities
were available for experimentation at temperatures higher than 1,000Â° C. that a fourth
point, A,, was discovered, representing the inversion of As. Without this discovery
our knowledge of the metallography of iron and ferrous alloys would be very incomplete,
and the explanation of their properties in some cases badly understood. On the other hand, referring to low temperatures, until the late Dr. J. Hopxuyson,
F.R.8., demonstrated the fact, it was not known that certain nickel steels of high
percentage, the non-magnetic properties of which appeared to indicate them as
abnormal, were really quite normal. He was able to demonstrate that the critical
point (Curie temperature) at which iron and most steels recover their magnetic state
on cooling is, for these high nickel steels, below atmospheric temperature, although the
reverse change on heating is, as ordinarily, above atmospheric temperature. Broadly speaking, we know now that physical and chemical activity increase with
temperature.
