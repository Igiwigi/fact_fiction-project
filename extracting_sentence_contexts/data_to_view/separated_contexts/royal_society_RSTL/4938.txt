From the sub-ganglionic trunk long coiled
vessels proceed, describe several convolntions in the midst of the fluid, and in a
perfectly naked and unsupported state, curve dorsally, still surrounded by the ehyl-
aqueous fluid, and empty themselves into the great dorsal trunk. In Nais macu-
losa (Waws) this distribution of the coiled vessels is 8till more readily demon-
strated, in consequence of the bright red colour of the blood enabling the observer
to trace the minutest vessels throughout their entire course. With respect to these
vessels there is one remarkable fact to be stated, namely, that they maintain their
singleness or individuality from their point of origin to their termination ; they do
not branch. In this fact is seen a beautiful provision against injury during the
contractions and elongations of the body. The slender column of blood contained
in these vessels, is directly and throughout its whole course exposed to the agency of
the peritoneal or chylaqueous fluid.
