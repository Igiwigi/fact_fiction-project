PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS MADE ON PIKE'S PEAK, COLORADO. 267

pressures were not considerably altered. In DouGias and Scunerper, on the contrary,
the radial pulses felt perhaps even more than normally full and hard. In both the
latter the dilatation and throbbing of the temporal arteries was a notable accompani-
ment of the headache of the first few days on the Peak. In Scunerper the headache
was to a great extent relieved during the day and while in erect positions, but for
several successive nights returned and persisted when he was in bed. In Futuer the
headache was at one time confined to one side of the head. Coincidently the ear
on that side was noticeably congested as compared with the other. In HunpErson
throughout our stay on the Peak stooping over for even a few seconds induced a
decided vertigo, a condition to which he is not at all prone at sea-level. - On the other
hand, emphasis should be laid upon the fact that neither in ourselves nor in others did
we see any sign of such hemorrhages as were described by the earlier observers, and
are still popularly believed to occur. Among the thousands of people of all sorts and
conditions who ascended the Peak during our stay nose-bleeds did not occur, so far as
we could learn, in more than half a dozen cases.

A few weeks before starting on the expedition Henprrson had, as a result of some-
what excessive smoking, developed a “ tobacco heart.” Although his pulse was always
restored to regular rhythm by moderate exercise, he frequently lost one heart beat in
eight or ten, and occasionally after sitting still for some time even one in three or
four. This condition continued throughout the stay on the Peak and for some months
thereafter. It was neither increased nor diminished on the Peak as compared with
the condition before and afterward at sea-level, nor was the discomfort which it
