Instead, the branch corresponding to the buckled
state is disconnected from the trivial branch, and it is bounded by a saddle-node bifurcation, i.e.

a stable and unstable pair of branches meet at the saddle-node near the undeformed value of : 8
the radius. Do

This relatively simple system is a didactic example in which the base state is linearly stable, : =
but there exists an alternative state that is observed in experiments under finite perturbation. In : S
fact, Chan & McMinn showed that the buckled state becomes exponentially close to the base state 2
as the radius of the confining ring decreases. Thus, eventually the imperfections in the system aed
are enough to force the buckled state. The situation is not the same as the classic imperfection 22
sensitivity of thin-walled shells under pressure loading [20].
