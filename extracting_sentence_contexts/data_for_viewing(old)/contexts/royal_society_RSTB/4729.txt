of this chitin might easily produce a red or a green colour instead of gold.

Finally, on morphological grounds, it is easier to conceive of the development
of a layer of ‘ Schillerstoff” than a periodic structure. Schulze* has shown that
the surface layer of the Stag Beetle (Lucanus cervus, Linn.) is not formed
gradually from the hypodermal cells, as in the case of skin or scales, but is due
to a fluid secreted from special glandular cells, which is ejected upon the surface
of the wing at a late period in pupal development, where it rapidly hardens.
This beetle is not iridescent, but presumably iridescent cuticles would be formed
in the same way. It is difficult to see how a periodic structure can arise in
a homogeneous medium after it has been excreted, except perhaps by a process
analogous to crystallisation. I was myself strongly opposed to the surface colour
theory, but the force of evidence has made me accept the fact that in the case
of scaleless beetles it is a more probable solution than the only other alternative,
a single film.

IV.—Descriprion or Sections MADE FROM CERTAIN IRIDESCENT STRUCTURES,
(a) Material and Methods.

Many methods have been described for cutting chitinous structures, but no
details could be found of a procedure specially devised for cutting scales. Very
great difficulty was at first encountered in obtaining sections of suitable thickness,
i.e., lw to 2u. The method eventually adopted certainly contains nothing new,
but a brief account of the exact technique followed may be found serviceable,
since success in cutting such difficult objects depends on strict adherence to
