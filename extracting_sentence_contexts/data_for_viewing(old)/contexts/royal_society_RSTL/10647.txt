Sextricting the lesion to the gyrus hippocampi and hippocampus itself respectively.

S When the cortex of the gyrus hippocampi was alone or mainly injured, as in Expe-

Siments 24 and 26, there was well-marked impairment of tactile sensibility on the

-ppposite 8ide, but not of permanent duration.

S When the fascia dentata and internal margin of the gyrus hippocampi were alone

â€”njured, as in Experiment 32, there was a remarkable hyperzsthesia of a transient

character, which has already been commented on. In another senze this fact is of

Smportance as showing that the anzsthesia resulting from lesions of the hippocampal

Sregion cannot, be explained away on any theory of mere proximity of the lesions to the
sensory tracts of the hemisphere. For in this case the lesion was nearer the crus
cerebri than in any of the others.

When the cornu ammonis alone was the seat, of lesion, as in the left hemisphere of
Experiment 33, there was for a time very marked anzsthesia of the opposite side.
But here, also, as in the cases where the gyrus hippocampl alone was injured, the
symptoms were only of temporary duration.
