6. Photography and the eclipse

Before the advent of photography, there was an important role for artists in recording the eclipses
and the full visual and atmospheric effects, both for dissemination among a wider public and for
the dedicated astronomer. When the first eclipse photography arrived, it did not instantly make the conventional artist
redundant, although over a few decades the fact that the event could be recorded simultaneously
from widely separate sites was to assist in resolving some of the remaining puzzles. The most
obvious contribution was the revelation that the solar corona revealed during an eclipse was
actually a core feature of the Sun and not, as many had thought, an atmospheric distortion during
observation or part of the Moonâ€™s atmosphere. In 1851, Berkowski produced a photograph (daguerreotype) of an eclipse and the corona
working from the Royal Observatory in Konigsberg (figure 24).
