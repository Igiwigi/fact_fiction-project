Paxr ILâ€”ON THE LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF REAL ROOTS IN EQUATIONS
OF THE FORM ZE(aw+d)*.

(15) I shall now proceed to the consideration of a theorem relating to a particular
class of ordinary equations, which occurred to me in the course of and .in connexion
with the preceding investigations. The theorem itself, but unaccompanied by proof, has
appeared in the * Comptes Rendus* of the Academy for the month of March 1864. Both as regards its nature and the processes inyolved in the proof, it stands in close
relation to NEwToN's rule, my study of which in fact led me to its discovery. It will
therefore take its place most appropriately in this paper. AND IMAGINARY ROOTS OF EQUATIONS.
