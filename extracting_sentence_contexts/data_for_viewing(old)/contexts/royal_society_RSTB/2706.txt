solution of cell-sap, obtained from the leaves of susceptible, or in other words,
diseased cucumber plants, germinated freely, and the germ-tubes were strongly
chemotactic.

These experiments, coupled with others made on immune tomato plants, using
spores of Macrosporium tomato for the purpose, prove that in future we shall be
justified in defining an immune plant as an individual, in which the positive
chemotactic substance, necessary for facilitating the entrance of the germ-tubes of
a given parasitic fungus into its tissues, is absent.

The endeavour to produce immune races of economic plants has been much
prosecuted of late years, and a certain amount of success has in some instances
attended such endeavours; but apart from the fact that immune plants have
constituted the basis of such experiments, the points aimed at have been the production
of a more resistent cuticle, bloom on the leaves, &e.

Now, with clearer knowledge as to what constitutes immunity, it follows that the
modifications required to attain this desired object are physiological rather than
morphological ; and the first step must necessarily be the determination of the exact
constituent or constituents of the cell-sap, exercising a chemotactic influence over the
germ-tubes of parasitic fungi.

MarsHatt Warp has demonstrated (3A), that the respective susceptibility or
immunity of species of Bromus, to the attack of Uredospores of Puccinia dispersa,
is not at all influenced by morphological characters. His summary on this point is
