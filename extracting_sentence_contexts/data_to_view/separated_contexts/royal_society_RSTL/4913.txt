This general observation will be afterwards con-
firmed by a variety of particular exemplifications. It has now been shown that in
Zoophytes and Medusz sea-water is admitted in large quantities, more or less directly,
into the chylechannels, with the contents of which it more or less directly mixes and
vitally assimilates. This fact may at present be mentioned as another fundamental par-
ticular, in which the chylaqueous fluid, in ALL animals, is distinguished from the blood-
proper, for into this latter fluid the external element is never immediately admitted ;
it is previously subjected to the influence of one or more organic processes ; it is thus

Mr. HuxLuy had recognised the principle that in all Acalephz the interior lining of the atomach and gastro-
vascular canals was more or less generally ciliated, that the moyements of the fluid contents were in great part

due to the agency of cilia,

combination with the vital fluid, The facility with which the most depressed forms
of life appropriate and vitalize a complex inorganic liquid, may be signalized as a
true badge of zoological inferiority.
