To the first difficulty I reply, that my experiments were not
made under the same circumstances that Nuck's is said to have
been; therefore, giving him full credit for what he has advanced,
a similarity of result cannot be expected. But it is painful to
me to differ from any writer of character in the statement of a

fact, where the truth is equally accessible to us both; and not-
withstanding the respect I willingly bear towards a name that
has both acquired and deserved considerable reputation, I must |
confess that it appears to me highly problematical, whether
this celebrated experiment be a reality, or only an ingenious
device. But some facts, which it will so0on be in order to relate,
will show (I think very clearly) that I rest my suspicion upon

_ fair grounds. In the mean time I feel it incumbent on me to
reply to the general principle of the objection, and to deter-
mine by experiment how far it is deserving attention.
