The analogy between these results and those obtained in the analysis of elliptic
functions is obvious. We cannot obtain, however, results which will connect such
expressions as

Yn (7 + 1) and gay (7).


DOUBLE GAMMA FUNCTION, 363

Integral Formule.

§ 70. In the general theory of multiple gamma functions the fundamental integral
formula expresses the fact that the integral of the n-ple gamma function can be
expressed in terms of (n+ 1)-ple gamma functions of specialised parameters. As we
have not yet defined the treble gamma function, we cannot prove this theorem for the

ease when 2 = 2. Inthe case when = 1, this proposition reduces to ALEXEIEWSKY’S
theorem (‘Theory of the G Funetion,” § 13). We proceed first to translate this
heorem into the notation of the present paper, and then to give an alternative proof

‘fapable of extension to the n-ple gamma functions.
2 The G function is substantially the double gamma function with equal angie:

es two being connected by the relation
