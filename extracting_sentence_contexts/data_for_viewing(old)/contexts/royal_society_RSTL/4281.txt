mens, they would become sources of great perplexity. We have already seen that
the cellular markings present two very distinct forms, the rounded (Plate V. fig. 1)
and the oblong (Plate V. fig. 6); the first of these being specially characteristic of
that simpler type of structure in which there is only a single layer of cells, but not
being confined to it; whilst the second is peculiar to the complex type, in which
there are two superficial layers, distinct from the intermediate stratum. Now the
occasional coexistence of both these plans of structure in a single individual (Â«| 33.),
sufficiently proves that the diversity of the surface-markings to which they respect-
ively give rise, cannot be regarded as a basis for specific distinction ; and when these
extremes of diversity are kept in view, it must be felt to be highly improbable that
Suny modifications of either form should possess greater importance. That such
modifications are mere individual varieties, is further evidenced by their gradational
"character, and by the fact that two or more of them may present themselyes in the
=ame disk. In my description of them, I shall limit myself to an account of those
more remarkable and frequently-recurring varieties, which will serve, I think, as a
Skey to any others that are likely to be met with.
-S 49. Although each surface, in either of the two principal types, ordinarily shows a
=division into concentric zones, which are again transversely subdivided s0 as to mark

-vno transverse subdivision is indicated, save by the alternation of lights and shadows
Sproceeding from a like alternation of solid substance and of hollow spaces beneath
S(Plate VII. fig. 7). This predominance of the concentric divisions, which gives a
Syery distinctive aspect to the disks which exhibit it, is usually most apparent in indi-

Svyiduals whose vertical section exhibits two planes of cells; and it has seemed to me
