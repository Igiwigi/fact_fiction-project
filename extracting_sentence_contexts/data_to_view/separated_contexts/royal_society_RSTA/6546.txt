If the velocity field is steady, the mixing
is poor and stretching for long times is linear, as in the case of a simple shear flow;
i.e. the stretching rate of line elements decays as 1/t (we are restricting ourselves
to bounded flows, that is were excluding elongational flows here). It is relatively
straightforward to produce flow fields that can generate stretching and folding and
hence chaos. In fact the most important lesson that should be learned about kine-
matics and mixing is encapsulated by the link twist maps (LTMs; see Wiggins &
Ottino 2004). In rough terms, a necessary condition for chaos is the ‘crossing’ of
streamlines (this must occur at different times). That is, two successive streamline
portraits, say at t and t + At for time-periodic two-dimensional flows, or at z and
z + Az for spatially periodic flows, when superimposed, should show intersecting
streamlines when projected onto the (x, y)-plane.
