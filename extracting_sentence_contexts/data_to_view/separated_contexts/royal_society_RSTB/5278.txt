It seems most natural to suppose that the group of coral islands around Headington,
Cowley, Bullingdon and Horspath provide the answer, as well as the main mass of the
reef farther west, where no detrital matter seems to have accumulated. In support

of this we notice the pronounced easterly dip of the beds, which, as suggested by Brak
and Huprrston, is probably false dip, such as may be seen in the corresponding beds
at Headington, and forms such a remarkable feature in the lower Osmington Oolite at
Todber, Dorset. ‘These authors further remark, “ We are here presented with the
deposits which were formed on the extreme edge, not only of the coral reef, whose thickness
would not account for so much false dip (which amounts in the most easterly quarry
to 12°, and is even marked 18° at another spot on the map), but probably of the Lower
Caleareous Grit sandbank also—a conclusion which is supported by the fact of its sudden
termination eastwards.” [6, p. 311]. In the northern part of the northern quarry at Wheatley the weathering of a portion
of the face fallen into disuse has revealed a significant fact.
