Eggs were put into the hypertonic solution
and their resistance measured at intervals of 10 minutes :—

For a reliable investigation of the effect of hypertonic solutions afte membrane
formation, two essential conditions are necessary. (1) All the eggs must respond to
the treatment with butyric acid, otherwise the conductivity of the eggs will be
affected by the action of the hypertonic solution upon those eggs which are still in
the resting stage. (2) After the treatment with the hypertonic solution, a large
percentage of the eggs must develop normally : otherwise there is no certainty that
the effect of the hypertonic solution is a normal one. As explained above, it is fairly simple to: satisfy-tlie first condition; in fact, the
eggs of most females of Sphwrechinus give 100 per cent. membranes after exposure
to a butyric acid solution for 14-3 minutes. On the other hand, it is the exception

~to obtain a large number of larvae from these eggs after a subsequent treatment with

a hypertonic solution. A large number of experiments were performed in which the
number of eggs which developed was only about 20 per cent.
