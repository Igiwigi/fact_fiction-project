At the level of whole
neural systems, too, it is widely assumed that information processing is closely determined by the inputs,
internal connectivity and outputs of the network of areas and nuclei that make up the brain. Some assumptions about neural structureâ€”function relationships are better substantiated than others, and
at many levels of organization the relationships have remained opaque and elusive. Part of the difficulty ar
from the fact that both structure and function are often very complex, so that demonstrating a compelling
relationship between them requires that both structure and function are characterized in considerable detail. There is, for example, a well-known mismatch between the anatomical complexity and extent of cortical
neurons and the localized physiological properties reported by neurophysiologists (Douglas & Martin 1991)
that is only now starting to give way through very detailed anatomical and physiological study (e.g. Douglas
et al. 1996).
