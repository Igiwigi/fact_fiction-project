and 5? 8. lat. with those between 5* and 20? to the North and of 5* to 30Â® to
the South, we find the interesting fact that the water flowing in the vicinity of the
Equator contains less salt than that which flows both to the north and to the south of
it. For the equatorial region (5* S. to 5* N.) the mean. of six obseryations is 35-575,
per 1000; or if we leave out a sample from Sir Janes Ross, from 150 fathoms' depth
(that from the swrface is wanting), it is 35:520.
