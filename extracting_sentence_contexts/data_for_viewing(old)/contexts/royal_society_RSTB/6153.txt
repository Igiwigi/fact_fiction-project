extension is due mainly to external forces in the first few years of radial growth.
The radial expansion of a differentiating tracheid, on the other hand, taking place
under the influence of a rapid intake of water, cannot be regarded in any sense as a
pure growth process. Hence the flattening of the spiral during this expansion in
no way contradicts these conclusions.

One or two points which arise from the experimental results require a little
further consideration. In the first place the approximate constancy of fibrillar
inclination on tangential walls seems to suggest that there is in the protoplasm some
mechanism which can not only orientate the micelles laid down in a new wall,
but can continue to do so over long periods in an exactly similar manner. It must be pointed
out that this is only an inference and is not directly contained in the results. The
actual known fact is that the average inclination on tangential walls remains constant
from year to year ; the individual readings may be varying wildly in any file of
tracheids within the measured limits of variation, although this seems quite improb-
able. Since now the radial walls of an initial seem to have quite a different inclina-
tion from the tangential walls, the directing influence of an old wall must overrule
any orienting tendency in the protoplasm. We may conclude, therefore, for the
cases studied, that in the absence of any old wall the protoplasm can lay down
