there is, however, no indication of the cartilage bones, so that the specimen is
considerably less advanced than H.

The basi-temporals have not yet made their appearance, and the present stage is,
therefore, valuable as showing the final form of the base of the skull before it has
been modified by the underlying membrane bones. This is well seen by comparing
figs. 4, 6, and 7 with Plate 9, figs. 76 and 77, and Plate 12, fig. 148, of my former
paper.

The anterior tympanic recess (figs. 4 and 6, a.tymp.r.) is a deep pit floored only by
membrane, and bounded in front by the basi-pterygoid process (B.Ptg.Pr.), the
apparent length of which is much greater than in later stages. This is, of course,
due to the fact that, on the appearance of the basi-temporal, its pretemporal wing
extends laterad forming a floor to the anterior tympanic recess, and continuous in
front with the basi-pterygoid process.

There, is a large posterior basi-cranial fontanelle (p.ber,fo.) filled with connective
tissue and appearing as an actual aperture when the latter is removed. The anterior
basi-cranial fontanelle (a.ber.fo.), and the carotid canals passing inwards from the
corresponding foramina (Int.car.) are clearly seen through the rostrum (fost.) when
the skull is examined by transmitted light. The middle fontanelle appears to have
closed.

The presphenoidal region can be made out with great clearness. Posteriorly the
presphenoid (fig. 3, Pr.Sph.) is separated from the orbito-sphenoid (Orb.Sph.) by
